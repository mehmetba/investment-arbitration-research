INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the United States-
Panama Trade Promotion Agreement signed on 28 June 2007, in force on 31 October
2012 (the ““TPA”), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the
“ICSID Convention”).

The Claimants are Bridgestone Licensing Services, Inc. (“BSLS”), a company
incorporated in the State of Delaware, United States; and Bridgestone Americas, Inc.
(“BSAM”), a company incorporated in the State of Nevada, United States (together, the

“Claimants”).!
The Respondent is the Republic of Panama (“Panama” or the “Respondent’).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to in this ruling as the
“Parties”, and the term “Party” is used to refer to either the Claimants or the
Respondent.? The Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page

(i).

This ruling concerns Panama’s Expedited Objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the

TPA.

Request for Arbitration, 4. Both are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Bridgestone Corporation (“BSJ”), a Japanese
incorporated company. Id.,{ .

? The Tribunal is mindful that Chapter 10 also refers to the States signatories to the TPA as “Party.”

For the clarity

 

of this ruling, the State signatories of the TPA (Panama and the United States) will be referred to as the “TPA Party”
or the “TPA Parties.” The Tribunal is also aware that Article 10.29 of the TPA refers to the Claimants and the
Respondent together as the “disputing parties” and to either of them as a “disputing party.”

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Registration and Constitution of the Tribunal

On 7 October 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 7 October 2016 from
the Claimants against the Respondent (the “Request for Arbitration”). The Request for

Arbitration was accompanied with Exhibits C-001 to C-043.

On 19 October 2016, the ICSID Secretariat requested the Claimants to provide certain

additional information and clarifications concerning the Request for Arbitration.

On 25 October 2016, the Claimants filed a communication in response to the ICSID
Secretariat’s request of 19 October 2016. This submission was accompanied by Exhibits

C-044 to C-050.

On 28 October 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration, as supplemented by letter of 25 October 2016, in accordance with Article
36(3) of the ICSID Convention, and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice
of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute
an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the

“Institution Rules”).

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to
constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party

and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.

The Tribunal is composed of Lord Nicholas Phillips Baron of Worth Matravers, a British
national, President, appointed by the co-arbitrators; Mr. Horacio A. Grigera Na6n, an
Argentine national, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, QC, a

Canadian national, appointed by the Respondent.

On 27 April 2017, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for

Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), the Secretary-General notified the

Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres,

ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The First Session, the Parties’ Written Submissions and Procedural Applications

On 30 May 2017, the Respondent filed Expedited Objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5
of the TPA (the “Expedited Objections”). The objections were accompanied by
Exhibits R-001 to R-014; and Legal Authorities RLA-001 to RLA-044. On 5 June 2017,
the Respondent transmitted Annex A to its Expedited Objections and its supporting

materials.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), on 6 June 2017, the Tribunal held a

first session with the Parties by video-conference.

Following the first session, the Tribunal and the Parties exchanged various
communications concerning the procedural calendar for the expedited phase. The
Tribunal received: communications from each Party, respectively, on 22 June 2017;
communications from each Party, respectively, on 26 June 2017; a communication from
the Claimants on 29 June 2017, and a communication from the Respondent on 30 June
2017. The Tribunal sent to the Parties communications dated 20, 23, 28 June 2017 and 2
July 2017. In this last communication of 2 July 2017, the Tribunal notified the Parties of

its decision regarding the procedural calendar.

On 11 July 2017, on behalf of the Tribunal, the President of the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 1 embodying the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters
and the decision of the Tribunal on the disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | provides,
inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April
2006 except to the extent modified by the TPA, that the procedural language would be
English, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, DC, United States.
Procedural Order No. | also included the schedule for the Expedited Objections phase of

the proceedings.

21.

On 24 July 2017, the Claimants filed their Response to the Expedited Objections pursuant
to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (the “Response on Expedited Objections”), accompanied
by: three witness statements, by Mr. Erick Calder6n, Mr. Roger Hidalgo and Mr. Thomas
R. Kingsbury, respectively; Exhibits C-051 to C-118;> and Legal Authorities CLA-001 to
CLA-037. The Response on Expedited Objections included an application for stay of the
expedited proceeding until the Respondent paid the first advance of funds requested in
this case; but following a letter dated 25 July 2017 confirming that the Respondent’s
payment had been received by ICSID on 21 July 2017, the Claimants’ application was
withdrawn by letter dated 26 July 2017.

Having previously consulted with the Parties, on 4 August 2017, the Tribunal (i)
informed the TPA “non-disputing Party”, i.c., the United States of America (“United
States” or “U.S.”)4 of the scheduled date for the Hearing on Expedited Objections (the
“Hearing”), and (ii) invited the United States to indicate whether it intended to make any
written or oral submission pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA, setting a deadline for

such submission.

On 7 August 2017, the Respondent filed its Reply on Expedited Objections pursuant to
Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (the “Reply on Expedited Objections”), accompanied by:
Exhibits R-015 to R-018; and Legal Authorities RLA-001 (REV) and RLA-002 (REV),
and RLA-045 to RLA-068.

On 14 August 2017, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Expedited Objections
pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (the “Rejoinder on Expedited Objections”),
accompanied by: two witness statements, by Ms. Audrey Williams, and Mr. Thomas R.

Kingsbury, respectively; Exhibits C-119 to C-126; and Legal Authority CLA-038.

On 14 August 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make certain submissions in

anticipation of the Pre-Hearing Call.

3 As submitted on 24 July 2017, the pleading was accompanied by Exhibits C-051 to C-097. On 28 July 2017, the

Claimants submitted an amended version, ol
inadvertently omitted in their 24 July 2017

 
  

ing that a subset of Exhibits, designated C-098 to C-118, had been
. Following a query from the Tribunal, on 2 August 2017, the

Respondent confirmed that it had no objections to these amendments.
+ The United States is referred to as the “non-disputing Party” in the sense of Article 10.29 of the TPA.

On 17 August 2017, the Parties made joint and individual submissions in anticipation of

the Pre-Hearing Call.

On 18 August 2017, pursuant to Section 20.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, a pre-Hearing
organizational call between the Parties and the President of the Tribunal was held by
telephone conference (the “Pre-Hearing Call”), in preparation for the Hearing. During
the Pre-Hearing Call, a matter was raised by the President and discussed with the Parties
concerning the timing for oral submissions regarding certain procedural evidentiary
issues arising out of the Parties’ written submissions, and for a determination by the

Tribunal regarding the impact of those issues on the conduct of the Hearing.

On 21 August 2017, following the Pre-Hearing Call, the Respondent submitted (i) an
application under Section 5.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, for reconsideration by the full
Tribunal of the Respondent’s procedural request made during the Pre-Hearing Call that
the session between the Parties and the full Tribunal to resolve the procedural evidentiary
issues and their impact on the conduct of the Hearing be held before the first day of the
Hearing (the “Request for Reconsideration”); and (ii) a request for a formal order from
the full Tribunal identifying the specific questions that the Tribunal wanted the Parties to

address before opening arguments at the Hearing (the “Request for Questions”).

On 24 August 2017, the full Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, addressing the
Respondent’s Request for Questions. In the same order, the Claimants were invited to

file observations on the Respondent’s Request for Reconsideration.

On 24 August 2017, the United States confirmed its intent to file a written submission,
pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA; and it informed the Tribunal that it was still

considering whether it would make an oral submission at the Hearing as well.

On 25 August 2017, the Claimants filed observations on the Respondent’s Request for

Reconsideration of 21 August 2017.

On 28 August 2017, in accordance with the deadline established by the Tribunal, the
United States filed a written submission, pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA (“U.S.

First Written Submission”).

On 29 August 2017, the full Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, concerning the
Respondent’s Request for Reconsideration of 21 August 2017, and the organization of

the Hearing.

On 29 August 2017, the Claimants asked the Tribunal to order the Respondent to provide
a supplementary translation of Legal Authority RLA-013. The Claimants’ application
attached a supplementary translation of RLA-013 already provided by the Respondent
voluntarily, and requested an order for a further translation. The Respondent filed

observations on this application also on 29 August 2017.

On 30 August 2017, the Tribunal ruled on the Claimants’ application of 29 August 2017.
That same day, the Respondent sent a further communication in response to the

Tribunal’s ruling.

On 1 September 2017, each Party filed observations on the tentative Agenda for the
Hearing, and on a few logistical and procedural matters pertaining to the organization of

the Hearing.

On 2 September 2017, the Tribunal approved the Parties’ agreements of 1 September
2017, and indicated that it would resolve the limited areas of disagreement at the start of

the Hearing.

FACTS

The Background Facts

The facts that follow are background facts that are not in dispute. There are disputes,
however, about the implications of some of these facts. The Tribunal will look more
closely at the facts when dealing with these disputes. The following facts merely set the

scene for the more detailed analysis that follows.

This arbitration arises in the context of a world-wide battle between two groups of
companies that manufacture and sell tires. One, the Chinese owned Luque Group,
markets, or seeks to market, tires under the mark “RIVERSTONE.”® The other, the
Japanese owned Bridgestone Group, markets tires under the marks “BRIDGESTONE”
and “FIRESTONE.”

In 1900, the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company was founded in Akron, Ohio. In 1931, a
rival company, the Bridgestone Tire Company Ltd. was founded in Japan. By the early
1950s this had become Japan’s largest tire manufacturer. In 1988 the Japanese company
acquired the American company.’ The resultant Bridgestone Group is the world’s largest
manufacturer of tire and rubber products. Tires account for about 80% of Bridgestone’s

sales worldwide.* The Bridgestone Group consists of well over 100 companies.?

The Japanese parent company, Bridgestone Corporation (“BSJ”) is the owner of the

BRIDGESTONE trademark, which has been registered by BSJ in many countries around

the world, including Panama.!° BSJ does not itself sell tires around the world under the
BRIDGESTONE trademark. Such sales are typically made by subsidiary companies,
indirectly wholly owned by BSJ, under licenses or sub-licenses granting the right to use
the trademark. The trademark is only used in relation to tires by companies that are part

of the group. Outside tire companies are not granted franchises to use the trademark.

51. As noted above, the First Claimant (“BSLS”) is a subsidiary in the Bridgestone Group,
registered in the State of Delaware, United States. The Second Claimant (“BSAM”) is a
subsidiary in the Bridgestone Group registered in the State of Nevada, United States.!!
Neither of these companies manufactures or sells tires. Each carries out activities on

behalf of the group.

52. In 2001, a substantial reorganization of the group took place. The FIRESTONE
trademarks that were registered outside of the United States were assigned to BSLS.
Those registered in the United States were assigned to another U.S. subsidiary,
Bridgestone Brands LLC.'* In the same year a loan for US$ 31 million was made to
BSLS by BSJ.'* Counsel for the Claimants informed the Tribunal that this sum was used
by BSLS to pay for the trademarks.'* BSLS then granted BSAM a license to use these
trademarks in an agreement dated 1 December 2001 (the “FIRESTONE Trademark
License”). This granted to BSAM a license to use trademarks registered in South
American countries, including Panama, which were set out in a lengthy schedule that
contained a total of approximately 1200 registered trademarks.'° The license provided

for BSAM to pay modest royalties to BSLS for the use of the trademarks.

The FIRESTONE Trademark License includes a right to grant sub-licenses to companies
in the group. BSAM has granted sub-licenses to a number of its own wholly-owned
subsidiaries. It is these subsidiaries that manufacture and sell tires bearing the
FIRESTONE mark in the countries where that mark is registered. One such subsidiary is
Bridgestone Costa Rica (“BSCR”).!° BSCR manufactures tires bearing the FIRESTONE
mark and sells these in Panama. There is, however, on the record no sub-license from

BSAM granting BSCR the right to sell tires bearing the FIRESTONE mark in Panama.

Turning to the use of the BRIDGESTONE trademark, on 1 December 2001, BSJ, as
owner of the BRIDGESTONE trademark, granted to a wholly-owned subsidiary of
BSAM called Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire LCC, subsequently
Bridgestone American Tire Operations, LLC (“BATO”), the right to use the
BRIDGESTONE trademark in relation to all tire products within the United States and
elsewhere (the “BRIDGESTONE Trademark License”).!’ The Claimants have placed
on the record a trademark sublicense agreement between BATO and BSCR which
licenses BSCR to use the Costa Rican trademarks owned by BSJ to manufacture tire
products in Costa Rica bearing the BRIDGESTONE trademark and to sell these
worldwide.'* That is, however, a 2015 agreement. There is no earlier document on the
record that evidences the grant by BATO to BSCR of the right to sell tires bearing the
BRIDGESTONE mark in Panama.

It is the policy of the Bridgestone Group to oppose any application to register a trademark

in relation to tires that bears the suffix “stone.”'?

In August 2002, a company
incorporated in Florida called L.V. International Inc., a member of the Luque Group,
applied to register the RIVERSTONE trademark in the United States. That application

was opposed by BFS Brands LLC, a U.S. incorporated subsidiary of BSJ,?° (who the

2004, BFS Brands’ lawyers wrote to L.V. International’s lawyers warning them that L.V.
International would be acting “at its own peril” if it used the RIVERSTONE mark in

other countries.”

On 4 February 2005, the Panamanian Trademark and Patent Office published an
application by a member of the Luque Group called Muresa Intertrade S.A. (“Muresa”)
for the registration in Panama of the RIVERSTONE trademark.?? BSJ and BSLS, in their
respective capacities as the owners of the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks,
initiated proceedings in the Panamanian courts opposing the registration of the
RIVERSTONE trademark. L.V. International and Tire Group of Factories Ltd. (“Tire
Group”), also part of the Luque Group, intervened in the proceedings.** On 21 July
2006, this opposition claim was denied.** BSJ and BSLS filed an appeal but

subsequently withdrew this.°

Muresa and Tire Group then commenced proceedings in the Panamanian Courts against
BSJ and BSLS alleging that their commencement of the opposition proceedings had been
wrongful and had caused them to cease sales of RIVERSTONE tires out of fear that their
inventory would be seized if they were to lose the proceedings.”’ They alleged that this
resulted in their sustaining losses exceeding US$ 5 million. L.V. International intervened
in support of this claim, contending that Muresa’s fears were justified having regard to

the terms of the letter that BFS Brands had sent to them on 3 November 2004.78

Muresa’s claim was rejected at first instance,”? and by the Panamanian Court of Appeal.*°
But, on a subsequent appeal, the First Civil Chamber of the Panamanian Supreme Court
gave a judgment dated 28 May 2014, which reversed the Court of Appeal’s judgment by
a majority of 2 to 1, and BSJ and BSLS were held jointly and severally liable to Muresa
and Tire Group in the sum of US$ 5 million, together with attorney’s fees of US$

431,000.*! It is that judgment that forms the basis of the claims in the present arbitration.

The Substantive Claims

It is the Claimants’ case that they owned or controlled investments in Panama that were
protected under the TPA, that the judgment of the Panamanian Supreme Court violated
that protection and that they are entitled in this arbitration to look to Panama for
compensation for the damage done to those investments. Panama’s five Expedited
Objections will require the Tribunal to look closely at much of the Claimants’ case. Once
again, the Tribunal at this stage seeks to do no more than set the scene for what is to

follow.

The investments in relation to which the Claimants seek relief consist of intellectual
property, or rights derived from intellectual property. So far as BSLS is concerned, the
right relied on is the FIRESTONE trademark registered in Panama that BSLS owned.
BSLS contends that this intellectual property constituted an investment for the purposes
of the ICSID Convention and the TPA. In these expedited proceedings, Panama has not

challenged that contention.

The investments in relation to which BSAM seeks relief are (i) the license that it had
been granted by BSLS to use the FIRESTONE trademark registered in Panama; and (ii)
the license that its wholly owned subsidiary, BATO, had been granted by BSJ to use the
BRIDGESTONE trademark registered in Panama. BSAM contends that these licenses

were “intellectual property rights” which constituted investments owned or controlled by

BSAM that fell within the protection of the TPA. Panama challenges that contention.

The Claimants contend that the judgment of the Panamanian Supreme Court was unjust
and arbitrary, and that it violated Panama’s obligations under the TPA (i) to accord fair
and equitable treatment to BSLS’s and BSAM’s investments; (ii) to accord to BSLS and
BSAM treatment no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors and their
investments; and (iii) not to expropriate BSLS’s and BSAM’s investments without
prompt, adequate and effective compensation, and in accordance with the other
requirements in the TPA.*? No challenge is made in this expedited proceeding to the
attack made by the Claimants on the judgment of the Panama Supreme Court, but it can

be expected to be hotly contested if this case proceeds to a hearing on the merits.

BSLS paid the amount of US$5,431,000 to discharge the judgment that had been given
against BSJ and BSLS jointly, with monies borrowed from BSAM, and claims these
sums as a head of compensation due.*? Panama alleges that this payment constituted an

abuse of process that prevents BSLS from invoking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.**

The essence of the remaining claims for compensation advanced by the Claimants is that
the judgment of the Supreme Court has devalued their investments by weakening the
protection given to registered trademarks in Panama and elsewhere in Latin America.*>
The total compensation claimed is a sum in excess of US$16 million.*® The Tribunal will
explore in more detail the nature of these claims when dealing with the Expedited

Objections made by Panama in respect of them.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF IN THE EXPEDITED
PHASE

The Respondent has requested:

“a. that, in accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the TPA, the
Tribunal evaluate the objections articulated herein on an expedited
basis, [...]; and

b. that, at the end of the expedited proceeding, the Tribunal issue

an award dismissing the case in its entirety for lack of jurisdiction,

ordering Claimants jointly and severally to bear all costs of the

arbitration, and awarding Panama full recovery of all of its costs

and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses), with

interest thereon at the rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2% per

annum from the date of the award to the date of payment.”*”
The Claimants, in turn, have requested that “the Objections [...] be dismissed in their
entirety”, and that the Tribunal issue “an order requiring the Respondent to pay the costs

of its Objections immediately.”**

The Parties’ respective positions regarding the objections at issue in this expedited phase
are summarized in the sections that follow. The Tribunal emphasizes that it has
considered the Parties’ arguments in their written and oral submissions in their entirety,
irrespective of whether an argument is referred to expressly in the summary of the

Parties’ positions in this ruling.

because it invoked this preliminary and expedited process.
Claimants argue, also “accords with practical sense” given that in an expedited process a
claim may be disposed of at the outset, without a full process and a full hearing.*! The
Claimants submit they are not aware of authority supporting the view that in a
preliminary expedited proceeding the burden of proof is the same applicable to any
jurisdictional objection, i.e., that the Claimants bear the burden proof, that no factual

allegations are accepted pro-tem, and that both Parties are entitled to adduce evidence.”

The Claimants observe that Article 10.20.5 of the TPA includes no express reference to

3

the applicable evidentiary standard in an expedited procedure,** and contend that the

standard set forth in Article 10.20.4(c) of the TPA applies to the objections in this

amendment thereof) [...]” and “[t]he tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in

According to the Claimants, as matter of proper construction of the TPA and in
application of Article 10.20.4(c): (i) the factual allegations in the Request for Arbitration
and in the Claimants’ 25 October 2016 letter are to be assumed as true, and factual
disputes raised by the Respondent are to be ignored;*° and (ii) any dispute over the
Respondent’s stand-alone allegations of fact that do not directly contradict allegations in
the Claimants’ pleadings, should be resolved in favour of the Claimants.*” The Rejoinder

on Expedited Objections states, more broadly, that the Claimants’ position is “that their

pleaded allegations of fact are to be subject to the deemed truthfulness provision at
Article 10.20.4(c) either as a matter of construction or pursuant to the Tribunal’s

discretion under Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.”**

The Claimants observe that Article 10.20.5 of the TPA has two limbs of expedited
objections, namely, “(i) objections that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a
claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26 (i.e.,
an objection under Article 10.20.4), and (ii) objections that the dispute is not within the
tribunal’s competence”,” and take the view that “Article 10.20.5 is to be construed such
that any objection raised thereunder is to be subject to the deemed truthfulness provision

at Article 10.20.4(c).”*° The Claimants argue that:

e = “[T]he natural and ordinary meaning of Article 10.20 is that the terms of 10.20.4
apply to the 10.20.5 expedited procedure, save to the extent the provisions at 10.20.4
as to timing are superseded by 10.20.5.”>!

e = It would be “incompatible with the spirit, purpose and context of the clause” and
“manifestly absurd and unreasonable” to conclude that Article 10.20.5 permits
“mini-trials” while Article 10.20.4 does not.*”

e = “[I]t would make no sense for an objection under the first limb of Article 10.20.5 to
be subject to such deemed truthfulness and an objection under the second limb not to
be so.”

e = “[I]t would not be sensible for objections as to competence that are brought on an
expedited basis to have a broader scope than objections brought on an expedited
basis under Article 10.20.4.”*4

In the alternative, the Claimants argue, even if the Tribunal concludes that the objections

are brought under the competence limb in Article 10.20.5 of the TPA and that the regime

difference between the standard applicable between the two limbs of Article 10.20.5 given that “they are both
questions of law.” Cl. Res. Exp. Obj., 1 60.

in Article 10.20.4(c) does not apply, as a matter of discretion pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rule 34, the Tribunal should assume as true the Claimants’ factual allegations
in their Request for Arbitration and their 25 October 2016 letter, and resolve factual
disputes in favour of the Claimants.*° The Rejoinder on Expedited Objections refers

more broadly to the Claimants’ “pleaded allegations of fact.”*®

For the Claimants, even if the Respondent’s construction of Article 10.20.5 of the TPA
were adopted,*’ Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules gives the Tribunal discretion “to
determine what approach to take to evidence and factual disputes for these purposes,
including whether it is appropriate, in expedited summary proceedings such as these, to
make final determinations on disputed facts.”** In the Claimants’ view, at a minimum,
“where there is a dispute of fact (whether or not pleaded) that can only satisfactorily be
resolved at a full trial or where by reason of the expedited nature of the current process
there may not have been a proper opportunity for the Claimant to obtain and present all
of the evidence that may be relevant, then the Tribunal should exercise its discretion for

these purposes to take the Claimants’ allegations to be true.”*°

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without prejudice to their primary position that
factual disputes must be deemed resolved in their favour in this expedited phase, the
Claimants say that, in the circumstances, they “had little option but to do [their] best in

the limited time available to put together and exhibit responsive evidence.”

The Claimants do not accept that the Respondent’s present objections fall under the
second limb of Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (i.e. objections to the Tribunal’s
competence).°! In the Rejoinder on Expedited Objections, the Claimants maintained that
the extent of the disputed issues of fact “strongly suggests” that the objections go beyond

competence and go into the merits of the case, referring “for example” to the second and

fifth objections, which the Claimants described as matters of causation.” At the Hearing,
the Claimants submitted the chart replicated below, reflecting inter alia, their position on

In the course of oral argument, however, the Claimants amended their positions in this

chart:

e As to the first objection, the Claimants ultimately submitted that indeed it does also
involve merit issues.

e As to the second objection, the Claimants ultimately contended that “as it is now, as
the positition has now emerged, is not one of competence.”

In their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants recognize that following the session on 3
September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, ruling that “the evidentiary
rule in Article 10.20.4 (c) of the U.S.-Panama TPA has no application in the present

the Claimants also indicated that to the extent that the objection was limited to the nexus (and assumed that the loss
had occurred), in that case, the issue would not involve a question of fact, but rather solely one of law, that could be
brought under Article 10.20.5. Tr. Day 1, 37:5-38:1 (Mr. Williams).

proceeding, and the Tribunal will address the issues on the basis of the evidence.”® The
Claimants argue, however, that this ruling still left open two of the questions presented by
the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 2, namely, (i) whether the Tribunal is required to
make final and definitive factual findings in relation to Article 10.20.5 objections; and (ii)
whether the Tribunal is required to decide all objections to competence including those

that are intertwined with the merits.

77. The Claimants argue that although the Tribunal is required to decide the objections,
“where the evidence is clearly incomplete [...] [the Tribunal] is not obliged to make final
and definitive findings of fact and law or to decide those Objections that are intertwined
with the merits”, but rather, it is open to the Tribunal to dismiss the objection(s) “on the
basis that the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof.”®’ The Claimants
insist that as the Hearing took place at a very early stage, under a highly compressed
timetable, and as the Respondent’s positions have evolved, “the Claimants have simply
not had a proper opportunity to submit all of their evidence on all of the issues.”© For
example, the Claimants submit, the nature of the objections has changed in the course of
the proceeding, and the Respondent and the Tribunal have raised new points at the
Hearing that the Claimants have not had an opportunity to deal with in evidence, even

though they would like to.”°

78. The Claimants further contend that if the objections are not properly brought under the
competence limb of Article 10.20.5, they must fail on that basis. According to the

Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief, only the first objection is one of “competence” (albeit

that the Tribunal wishes to look at the evidence, the evidence.” Tr. Day 1, 19:6-13 (Mr. Williams). They went on to
argue that it “w/timately it falls to the Tribunal to decide is it safe to make final findings of fact or not, on the basis of
the material before it’ and that “[t]o the extent that it is not, or that the material before the Tribunal does not
support such a finding, then the Respondent’s application must fail.” Tr. Day 1, 20:20-21:3 (Mr. Williams).

are not.”! But, in light of the procedural agreement reached in connection with objection
third, the Claimants only ask that the second, fourth and fifth objections be dismissed on

the ground that they are not a matter of competence.”

79. At the Hearing, the Claimants ultimately submitted that, given the requirement in the
TPA that the proceedings on the merits be suspended during the expedited objections
phase, “in circumstances where a decision would necessarily involve aspects of the
merits, then that would not conform with what the regime of the TPA requires.”"> The
Claimants reiterate that conclusion in the Post-Hearing Brief, arguing that the Tribunal
should dismiss any objection where the issue of competence is intertwined with the
merits, and where due to the expedited nature of the proceeding “all the necessary
evidence is not before the Tribunal, and so the Respondent has failed to discharge its
burden of proof.”"* The Claimants argue that objections one, two and fifth (if not already

dismissed) should be dismissed on this basis.”>

merits “should still be decided; but, in order for the objection to succeed, the Tribunal would need finally to decide
in the Respondent’s favor both the objection and the issue on the merits, and any such decision would have to be
made on the basis of undisputed allegations of fact and, to the extent the Tribunal considers it appropriate, the
evidence. And where the objection and the merits’ issues cannot safely be finally decided on that basis, then the
objection fails.” Tr. Day 1, 23:13-24:3 (Mr. Willian

81. Panama explains that Article 10.20.5 of the TPA refers to three different types of
objections, the second type being objections to the Tribunal’s competence; and contends
that the Respondent has only advanced objections to competence in this expedited
phase.”* The Respondent further disputes that the evidentiary standard is the same no

matter the type of objection under Article 10.20.5 of the TPA.”

82. The Respondent takes issue with the allegation that it would not be “sensible” for the
TPA to provide that expedited objections to competence have a broader scope than
expedited objections under Article 10.20.4.°° It argues that the role of a tribunal is treaty
interpretation, and not to opine on whether a treaty policy was sensible or not.*! And in
any event, Panama submits, it is indeed sensible for expedited objections to competence
to have broader scope than objections under Article 10.20.4, because they are different:
one set relates to the tribunal’s authority to hear the claim, while the other set refers to
objections that as a matter of law there is no genuine claim to be heard.*? Panama further
submits that there is nothing absurd in the contention that objections to jurisdiction and
objections that a claim fails as a matter of law have different evidentiary standards,

because that is the rule under international law.*?

83. Panama points out that when Article 10.20.5 of the TPA refers to objections to
competence and to objections under Article 10.20.4 it separates them with the word
“and”, indicating that they are different. The reference to both would be “redundant” if

the scope were the same, and treaty language should be deemed meaningful.**

84. The Respondent also disputes that there is no difference in practice between objections
under Article 10.20.4 and objections to competence because they are both questions of

law. The Respondent disagrees that objections to the Tribunal’s competence are solely a

using the words “as a matter of law”, Panama submits, it would be improper to imply that
description into the other category (i.e., objections to competence).*°

Panama also denies that Article 10.20.5 of the TPA indicates that the evidentiary standard
applicable to Article 10.20.4 objections always applies in the context of an expedited

Article 10.20.5 proceeding, regardless of the type of objection.*”

According to Panama,
Article 10.20.4(c) only applies to Article 10.20.4 objections, and it does not address or
govern the other two types covered by Article 10.20. It says nothing about the treatment

of factual allegations relating to competence.**

In the Respondent’s submission, “the applicable standard is the same one that always
applies in the context of jurisdictional objections, under which the claimant bears the
burden of proof, there is no presumption of the veracity or acceptance pro tem of its

“89 There is no

factual allegations, and both parties are entitled to adduce evidence.
reason why disputed facts cannot be decided with expedition in this case, given that: (i)
most of the “factual” issues simply involve evaluation of the Claimants’ own evidence;
and (ii) the Respondent has only introduced evidence for one issue (whether BSLS has
substantial business activities), which the Claimants should have been able to establish
with relative dispatch.°? For Panama, accepting the Claimants’ jurisdiction-related
factual allegations pro-tem would entail multiple assessments of the same issues,
defeating the very purpose of the expedited review mechanism in the TPA.°! And
“Ts]uch a result would constitute the type of unforeseen event Panama mentioned when it
reserved its right to seek bifurcation of jurisdictional objections following this expedited

proceeding.”**

The Respondent also takes issue with the notion that jurisdiction exists until the
Respondent shows otherwise. It argues that the international law rule is exactly the
opposite, namely, that a claimant is required to prove jurisdiction regardless of whether

objections to jurisdiction are raised, and nothing in the TPA alters this rule. °°

Further, in Panama’s view, “there is no excuse for Claimants’ failure to meet their
burden of proof.”°* First, referring to the Pre-Hearing Call, Panama observes that the
Claimants have conceded that they had sufficient time to gather evidence concerning the
denial of benefits objection, and argue that the Claimants had even more time to gather

evidence on factual issues underlying the other objections:

the Bridgestone Group
announced publicly that it was contemplating TPA claims two years prior to the Request
for Arbitration, time during which the Claimants had every incentive to gather evidence
on jurisdictional issues;°° and the time following the Request for Arbitration could also
have been used to gather evidence.”’ Second, Panama contends, even if the expedited
phase had been the only opportunity to gather evidence, the Claimants cannot reasonably
argue a denial of due process because: (i) they knew they had to “protect themselves” by
submitting evidence on the factual matters at issue in the expedited objections, and had
months to do so; (ii) any relevant evidence would have been within the Claimants’ reach
or control; and (iii) the Claimants consented to arbitration in accordance with the TPA,

and therefore consented to expedited resolution of objections under Article 10.20.5.°°

Lastly, in response to the Tribunal’s questions in Procedural Order No. 2, the Respondent

stated at the Hearing:

“[...] ‘Should the Tribunal rule on Panama’s objections under
Article 10.20.5 of the TPA as a matter of law on assumed facts,
applying (either as a matter of law or as a matter of discretion) the
approach laid down in Article 10.20.4(c), or instead, should the

Tribunal make final and definitive findings of fact and law in
relation to those objections’?

[...] because Panama’s objections under Article 10.20.5 are
objections to jurisdiction, there is no basis for applying the
approach laid down in 10.20.4(c). And, consistent with the general
rule under international law, the Tribunal must make final and
definitive findings of fact and law in relation to those objections.

[...] ‘Does the obligation under Article 10.20.5 to decide on an
expedited basis any objection that the dispute is not within the
Tribunal’s competence apply to any objection, or all objections to
competence or only those that do not require the Tribunal to
determine the merits of the Claimants' substantive claim?’

[...] the answer is: first, as indicated by the words ‘any objection
(to competence),’ the obligation applies to all objections to
competence; and in any event, none of the objections here requires
the Tribunal to determine the merits of the Claimants’ substantive
claims [...].”

B. The U.S. Submissions

90. In its Article 10.20.2 submission, the United States observes that Articles 10.20.4 and
10.20.5 of the TPA draw “a clear distinction” between three categories of procedures for

preliminary objections, namely “claims that cannot prevail as a matter of law’,

“objections to the tribunal’s competence” and “other objections.” '

91. Referring to Article 10.20.4, the United States submits that:

“Subparagraph (c) states that, for any objection under paragraph 4,
a tribunal ‘shall assume to be true’ the factual allegations
supporting a claimant’s claims. The tribunal ‘may also consider
any relevant facts not in dispute.’ This evidentiary standard
facilitates an efficient and expeditious process for eliminating
claims that lack legal merit. Subparagraph (c) does not address,
and does not govern, other objections, such as an objection to

reference to the U.S. First Submi n, that Article 10.20.5 supersedes the provision in ICSID Arbitration Rule 41
that grants the Tribunal the power to join to the merits jurisdictional objections intertwined with the merits).

competence, which the tribunal may already have authority to

consider.” !!
For the United States, the distinction drawn in Article 10.20.5 between an “objection
under paragraph 4” and an objection to the tribunal’s competence demonstrates that the
requirements in Article 10.20.4 “are not incorporated into the paragraph 5 mechanism

when it is being used to address the latter.” '°?

The United States further submits that Article 10.20.5:

“[M]odifies the applicable arbitration rules by requiring a tribunal

to decide on an expedited basis any paragraph 4 objection as well

as any objection to competence, provided that the respondent

makes the request within 45 days of the date of the tribunal’s

constitution.”!%
Finally, the United States argues that the “normal rules of burden of proof’ are not
altered by Article 10.20.5 of the TPA; and thus with respect to objections to competence,
the claimant has the burden to prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish the
tribunal’s competence.'!* Therefore, “[a] tribunal may not assume facts in order to

establish its jurisdiction when those facts are in dispute.” '°

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The provisions of Article 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the TPA appear in similar, though not
always identical, form in a number of BITs and Free Trade Agreements to which the
United States is party. In this case, pursuant to Article 10.20.5, Panama has requested the
Tribunal to decide on an expedited basis five objections that the dispute is not within the
Tribunal’s competence. The Tribunal has not been referred to, and is not aware of, any
previous decision in which the effect of such a request under Article 10.20.5 of the TPA

has been considered.

96. In oral argument counsel for the Claimants urged the Tribunal to adopt “a practical,
common sense approach” to the procedure.'°° The Tribunal is in sympathy with that
submission. Procedural rules should, so far as possible, be applied in such a manner as

will facilitate, not inhibit, the fair and economic resolution of disputes.

97. The meaning of a term of a treaty must be determined in the light, inter alia, of its object
and purpose.'°? The object and purpose of the provisions of Article 10.20.4 are not in
dispute. They, or very similar provisions, were first introduced by the United States into
its investment treaty-making practice in or about 2002 in reaction to the NAFTA case
Methanex.'° In that case, the United States argued at an early stage that the claims were
inadmissible because they were without legal merit, but the tribunal ruled that it could not
address this issue in a preliminary stage. Only after years of costly proceedings did the
tribunal finally dismiss the claims, on the grounds that they fell outside its jurisdiction
and, in any event, were devoid of merit.!° Thus Article 10.20.4 is designed to enable a
tribunal to dismiss at an early stage claims that are demonstrably doomed to failure,

thereby saving time and costs.

98. The desirability of saving time and costs equally underlies procedural provisions that can

lead to bifurcation of a proceeding, under which some issues are resolved in advance of a

hearing “on the merits.” Resolution of such issues against the claimant can result in a

final award against it that obviates the need for the hearing on the merits.
99. Article 41 of the ICSID Convention is such a procedural provision:

Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America, n.17: “Although the United States is not a party to the

(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not
within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not
within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the
Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a
preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.”
Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in turn sets out the procedural aspects for dealing

with such an objection:

“(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not
within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not
within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as
possible. [...]

(3) Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute,
the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits.

[J

(4) The Tribunal shall decide whether or not the further procedures

relating to the objection made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be

oral. It may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or

join it to the merits of the dispute. [...]”
Panama has, at all times, submitted that Article 10.20.5 entitles a respondent to require
the Tribunal to make a final determination, based on evidence, of whether or not the
dispute falls within the Tribunal’s competence. The Claimants have, at all times,
submitted that any hearing pursuant to an expedited objection under Article 10.20.5
should be determined, either by application of the test in Article 10.20.4(c) or, as a matter
of discretion, not by evaluation of evidence but on the premise that the facts pleaded by
the Claimants are correct, leaving it open to Panama, should Panama’s expedited
objections be dismissed, to make a further challenge to the competence of the Tribunal,

based on the evidence.

Despite the stance described above, the Claimants placed on the record a substantial body
of evidence in support of their claims. They did so in case the Tribunal should rule that
the objections to competence would fall to be decided on the evidence. At the expedited

Hearing, they accepted that if the Tribunal considered that it was in a position to make a

28

103.

104.

105.

final determination on the evidence of the issues raised by the Respondent’s Expedited

Objections it would be free to do so.!!°

It was in these circumstances that the Tribunal invited the Parties to address the following

questions in a preliminary session at Day | of the Hearing:

“(1) Should the Tribunal rule on Panama’s objections under Article
10.20(5) of the TPA as a matter of law on assumed facts, applying
(either as a matter of law or as a matter of discretion) the approach
laid down in Article 10.20(4)(c) or should the Tribunal make final
and definitive findings of fact and law in relation to those
objections[?]

(2) Does the obligation under Article 10.20(5) to decide on an

expedited basis ‘any objection that the dispute is not within the

Tribunal’s competence’ apply to all objections to competence or

only to those that do not require the Tribunal to determine the

merits of the Claimants’ substantive claim?”!!!
After hearing argument, the Tribunal made a ruling in Procedural Order No. 4 that
deliberately did no more than address those parts of the two questions that it was

necessary to resolve in order to continue with the Hearing:

“[T]he evidentiary rule in Article 10.20.4(c) of the U.S.-Panama
TPA has no application in the present proceeding, and the Tribunal
will address the issues on the basis of the evidence.”!!”

The Tribunal will now explain the basis and the implications of this Order.

The starting point is Article 10.20.4. In Pac Rim!" an identically worded Article in the
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement of 2004
(“CAFTA”) received consideration, together with Article 10.20.5. The tribunal made the

following observations:

“Pac Rim, Preliminary Objections”.

29

106.

“105. [...] the Tribunal approaches the procedure under CAFTA
Article 10.20.4 tempered by a lack of formalism, with an emphasis
on substance and practical common-sense.

[J

106. As regards the expedited procedure under Article 10.20.5, it is
twinned with the procedure under Article 10.20.4 with an
additional ground of objection as to competence [...]

110. [...] to grant a preliminary objection, a tribunal must have
reached a position both as to all the relevant questions of law and
all relevant alleged or undisputed facts that an award should be
made finally dismissing the claimant’s claim at the very outset of
the arbitration proceedings, without more. Depending on the
particular circumstances of each case, there are many reasons why
a tribunal might reasonably decide not to exercise such a power
against a claimant, even where it considered that such a claim
appeared likely (but not certain) to fail if assessed only at the time
of the preliminary objection.

111. At all times during the exercise under CAFTA Articles
10.20.4 and 10.20.5, the burden of persuading the tribunal to grant
the preliminary objection must rest on the party making that
objection, namely the respondent.

112. Given the tight procedural timetable and deadlines under
CAFTA Article 10.20.5, it is clear that an expedited preliminary
objection is not intended to lead to a ‘mini-trial.’. A contrary
conclusion would attribute to the CAFTA Contracting Parties a
perverse intention to render investor- state arbitration even more
expensive and procedurally difficult for the disputing parties, when
it would seem from these provisions (read as a whole) that the
actual intention of the Contracting Parties was, manifestly, the
exact opposite. The procedure under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 is
clearly intended to avoid the time and cost of a trial and not to
replicate it. [...]”

With the exception of the passing reference to “an additional ground of objection as to
competence”, in paragraph 106 the Pac Rim tribunal’s remarks were addressed to an
objection under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 that a claim “is not a claim for which an award
in favour of the claimant may be made”, and to the expedition of such an objection
pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.5. On that basis, this Tribunal endorses the reasoning

of the tribunal in Pac Rim. It does not, however, necessarily follow that this reasoning

30

109.

can be applied to an expedited objection to the competence of a tribunal under Article
114

10.20.5, for the two regimes are different, as the tribunal in Renco’™ identified.

Renco involved an arbitration under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement
(the “U.S-Peru TPA”) and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (2010). Article 10.20.4 of
the U.S.-Peru TPA differed from that in the present case inasmuch as it commenced:
“[w]ithout prejudice to the tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a
preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal’s
competence ...].”''> Peru had purported to make six preliminary objections pursuant to
Article 10.20.4 of the U.S.-Peru TPA. Renco argued that four of these were objections as
to the tribunal’s competence and that it was not open to a respondent to make such
objections under Article 10.20.4. The tribunal’s 53-page decision, made without an oral
hearing, was devoted to the single issue of whether or not objections as to the competence

of a tribunal could be brought pursuant to Article 10.20.4 of the U.S.-Peru TPA.

On the basis, primarily, of textual analysis the tribunal accepted Renco’s argument. It
found that Article 10.20.4 of the U.S.-Peru TPA drew a distinction between a
“competence objection{] brought under the applicable arbitration rules”,''® and an
objection authorized by Article 10.20.4 itself that as a matter of law a claim was not one
for which an award in favour of the claimant might be made. Only the latter type of
objection could be brought under Article 10.20.4 of the U.S.-Peru TPA. So far as Renco
was concerned, the applicable arbitration rule that authorized dealing with objections as

to competence as a preliminary issue was Article 23(3) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules.!!7

The Tribunal finds this reasoning of the tribunal in Renco compelling and applicable in
the present case, notwithstanding the difference in the wording of Article 10.20.4 of the
U.S.-Peru TPA. In the present case, the relevant arbitration rules that authorise the

Tribunal to deal with preliminary objections as to the competence of the Tribunal are to

be found in Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules set out at paragraphs 99 and 100 supra.

110. Thus far, the Tribunal’s conclusions accord with submissions made by Panama.!!® The
critical question is, however, the effect in relation to each type of objection, of Article
10.20.5. The Claimants’ primary submission was that the provisions of Article
10.20.4(c) fell to be applied both to an expedited hearing of an objection brought under
Article 10.20.4 and to an expedited hearing of an objection as to competence. By
Procedural Order No. 4 the Tribunal rejected this submission. As a matter of textual
analysis, Article 10.20.4(c) only applies to an objection under Article 10.20.4 and not to
objections as to the competence of the Tribunal. Furthermore, there are some types of
objection as to competence, such as Objection No. 3 asserting a denial of benefits, where

Article 10.20.4(c) is incapable of application in practice.

111. _ If, as the Tribunal has ruled, Article 10.20.4(c) has no application to an expedited hearing
of an objection as to competence, what, if any, rules do apply to such a hearing? Panama

has made the following submission:

“[...] [T]he applicable standard is the same one that always applies
in the context of jurisdictional objections, under which the
claimant bears the burden of proof, there is no presumption of the
veracity or acceptance pro tem of its factual allegations, and both
parties are entitled to adduce evidence.” !!?

112. This submission appears to treat Article 10.20.5 as providing the Tribunal with free-
standing authority, and indeed obligation, to make a final decision, based on evidence, in
relation to any objection as to competence, regardless of the extent to which this will
preempt findings that would normally be made on the merits hearing or conflicts with

procedural rules that would otherwise apply to a preliminary hearing on jurisdiction. The

Tribunal does not accept this scenario.

Article 10.20.4 provides that it is “[w]ithout prejudice to a tribunal’s authority to address
other objections as a preliminary question.”'? Article 10.20.5 requires the Tribunal to
decide on an expedited basis “any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s

competence.” 7!

Such an objection must be one of those referred to in Article 10.20.4,
namely one that falls within the authority of the Tribunal pursuant to an applicable

procedural rule. This conclusion accords with the U.S. First Written Submission:

“Paragraph 5 provides an expedited procedure for deciding

preliminary objections, whether permitted by paragraph 4 or the

applicable arbitral rules.” '??
The requirement to decide an objection on an expedited basis must be read together with
the rule or rules under which such an objection is authorized. The U.S. First Written

Submission comments:

“Paragraph 5 thus modifies the applicable arbitration rules by

requiring a tribunal to decide on an expedited basis [...] any

objection to competence [...].”!73
Panama submitted that this meant that Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41
of the Arbitration Rules were not merely modified, but wholly superseded by a request
under Article 10.20.5.'°4 The Tribunal does not accept this interpretation of the United
States’ comment, and would not agree with it. The provisions of Article 41 and Rule 41
are designed to give the Tribunal the authority necessary to conduct proceedings in the
most efficient and cost effective manner. It is a radical submission, which is not accepted
by the Tribunal, that the right accorded to the Respondent by Article 10.20.5 to require an

expedited decision in relation to competence deprives the Tribunal of this authority.

‘When Panama invoked the right to request that its objections as to jurisdiction should be

Al of the Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal’s authority to reach a decision on the
objections on an expedited basis is subject to the regime laid down in Article 41 and Rule
Al, subject to one modification. Rule 41(3) gives the Tribunal an option to suspend the

proceedings on the merits. Article 10.20.5 requires the Tribunal to do so.

Article 41 and Rule 41 grant to the Tribunal a number of options as to how to proceed.
There is considerable jurisprudence, some of it conflicting, as to the correct approach to
the exercise of these options. Panama has placed in the record a large part of Douglas’s
book, !75 though not all that is relevant to this matter. The Tribunal is satisfied with his
treatment of this subject. It is no longer of direct relevance and the Tribunal will

summarise the position by reference to his work.

Where an objection as to competence raises issues of fact that will not fall for
determination at the hearing of the merits, the Tribunal must definitively determine those
issues on the evidence and give a final decision on jurisdiction.!”° This is the position as

far as Objection No. 3 asserting a denial of benefits is concerned. '”

Where an objection as to competence raises issues of fact that will fall for determination
at the merits stage, the usual course is to postpone the final determination of those issues
to the merits hearing. In those circumstances, it is usual for the tribunal to make a prima
facie decision on jurisdiction on the assumption that the facts pleaded by the claimant are
correct.'?* It will then be open to the respondent, if its preliminary objection fails, to
have a second “bite at the cherry” at the merits hearing on the basis of the facts that will

then be determined.

The Tribunal rejects Panama’s submission that it has no authority on an expedited
objection to competence under Article 10.20.5 to reach a decision on a prima facie basis
and to join the issue of competence to the merits of the dispute. Such authority is

essential if the Tribunal is to be in a position to prevent the hearing of the expedited

objection turning into a mini, or even a maxi, trial. It is also consonant with the
obligation under Article 10.20.5 to “suspend any proceedings on the merits.”'?? A
decision to join the objection to the merits of the dispute will satisfy the Tribunal’s

obligation under Article 10.20.5 to issue an expedited decision on the objection.

It is, however, open to the Tribunal to make a determinative finding of fact and to base a
final award or decision upon this at the expedited phase if it considers this appropriate.
In this case, Panama’s Expedited Objections, apart from Objection No. 3, do not raise any
significant issues of fact. Far from disputing the facts alleged by the Claimants,
Panama’s objections are essentially based upon these. The Claimants have adduced a
body of evidence in support of their pleaded case, but again this evidence has not been

significantly challenged. The issues are essentially issues of law, not fact.

It is none the less the case that the evidence adduced by the Claimants gives an
incomplete picture, as the Claimants are aware. They contend that the expedition of the
process has prevented them from placing before the Tribunal some of the evidence that
they would have wished to adduce had a more leisured approach been permitted.'*° In
the event the Tribunal is confronted with a jig-saw puzzle with some of the pieces
missing. The fact remains that, apart from evidence adduced in relation to Objection No.
3 — denial of benefits —- Panama has not advanced a positive case that conflicts with that
advanced by the Claimants. In these circumstances, the Tribunal has concluded that it is
in a position, on the basis of the evidence that is before it together with allegations made
by the Claimants that Panama has accepted, to make final determinations of fact in
relation to Panama’s Expedited Objections and, in accordance with Procedural Order No.

4, this is what it will proceed to do.

The Parties have made submissions in relation to burden of proof. The Tribunal
indicated that, at the end of the day, burden of proof was unlikely to prove important.
That remains the Tribunal’s view, but it will address the question of burden of proof in

the context of the individual objections.

The Respondent disputes that “tire sales (and profits from tire sales) in Panama, (2)
‘revenue sharing and license rights in Panama’ and (3) ‘intellectual property rights in
Panama’” may constitute BSAM’s “investment”,'* arguing that: (i) ordinary commercial
transactions do not qualify as an investment;'** and (ii) merely having a license
conferring revenue sharing and intellectual property rights is insufficient, because while
those are among the forms that an investment may take pursuant to the TPA, under that

treaty “substance shall prevail over form.”'>>

Panama explains that BSAM is first
required to demonstrate that such revenue sharing and intellectual property rights meet
the chapeau of the TPA definition of “investment”, that is, that they constitute an “asset
that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an
investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other
resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.”'°° And, according
to Panama’s initial submission, BSAM cannot make this showing, for the following

e The “revenue sharing rights” in the sales by a subsidiary are not “investments”,
because the TPA expressly provides that “claims to payment that are immediately
due and result from the sale of goods or services are not an investment.” '*8

e Chapter 10 of the TPA applies only to investments located in Panama, and thus, the
rights must “exist under Panamanian domestic law”, which is not the case with
respect to the three licenses submitted with the Claimants’ 25 October 2016 letter
(C-048 to C-050). °°

In the Reply on Expedited Objections, Panama insists that the “thrust” of the Claimants’

case is that the sales in Panama by BSAM’s Costa Rican subsidiary (Bridgestone Costa

Rica (“BSCR”)), the rights thereto and the activities associated therewith qualify as an

“investment.” 4°

This cannot be so, Panama argues, because: (i) sales are not
investments; (ii) rights, activities, commitments, expectations and risks associated with,
and the duration of, cross-border sales do not add up to an investment; (iii) “marketing”
and “sale” activities are only relevant to the extent they relate to an “investment”, and
expenditures alone do not amount to an “investment”; (iv) pointing to an item in the list
of forms an investment may take in the definition in Article 10.29 of the TPA is not
sufficient; (v) not all contractual rights are assets, and under the TPA only “assets that an
investor owns or controls directly or indirectly” qualify as an “investment”, and only
investments “in the territory” of the host-State are protected; (vi) the Claimants have not
identified any asset in Panama, that BSAM owned or controlled at the time of the

Supreme Court decision of 28 May 2014, at the center of their claims.'*!

Expanding on point (vi) supra, the Respondent explains that the alleged “intellectual
property” and “revenue sharing” rights described in the five agreements mentioned in the

Claimants’ Response on Expedited Objections (C-048 to C-050, C-052 and C-064)

because (a) it is not an “asset” in Panama, but rather a limited and non-exclusive
right to “use” a Panamanian trademark, conferred by a contract between two U.S.
entities, created, governed and performed under U.S. law; and (b) and even if it were
an “asset”, it is not owned or controlled by BSAM, as demonstrated by the fact that
BSAM had to license it from a third party and by the terms of the agreement. '47

The Trademark License Agreement between Bridgestone Corporation and
Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire, LLC (1 December 2001) (C-052)
(hereinafter, the “BRIDGESTONE Trademark License”) confers a right that
cannot be construed as an “asset” in Panama, and even if it did, it would not be
owned or controlled by BSAM. !##

The Trademark Sublicense Agreement between Bridgestone Americas Tire
Operations LLC and Bridgestone Costa Rica, S.A. (1 January 2015) (C-049) is not

in “investment” in Panama, because (a) it only authorizes a Costa Rican subsidiary
to use Costa Rican trademarks, it does not discuss Panamanian intellectual property,
and it is governed by U.S. law; and (b) is irrelevant because it post-dates the
Supreme Court decision of May 2014, and thus it does not demonstrate that BSAM
had an investment at the time of the alleged violation. “5

The Trademark License Agreement between Bridgestone Corporation and
Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holding, Inc. (1 January 2002) (C-050) is irrelevant
because (a) it is governed by Japanese law; (b) it does not confer any right to
conduct activities in Panama; (c) the right that it confers is not an “assert”; and (d)
even if it were an “asset” the nature and the terms of the agreement establish that
BSAM does not “own or control” it.!4°

The Bandag System Franchise Agreement between Bandag Inc. and Rodelag, S.A.
(27 September 1965) (C-064) (hereinafter, the “Bandag Agreement”) authorized a
Panamanian entity to use a U.S. patented method in exchange for royalty, but (a)
given that the underlying patent has expired is unclear what rights the agreement
confers at present, and how those patents have any relevance; (b) not every contract
wherein royalty payments are made falls under the category listed in Article 10.29(e)
of the TPA; and (c) it does not qualify as the type of licenses referred to in Article
10.29(g) of the TPA because it is a private contract, governed by U.S. law that
confers the right to use U.S. intellectual property. '*”

work in this case. Tr. Day 4, 528:17-529:10 (Ms. Silverman).

At the Hearing, the Respondent insisted that the issue is not whether the FIRESTONE
and BRIDGESTONE Trademark Licenses qualify as an “intellectual property right’,
because that “does not matter.’ BSAM first needs to comply with the chapeau of the
definition of “investment” in Article 10.29 of the TPA, and it is not able to do so as it has
no “asset owned or controlled directly or indirectly.”'*8 In responding to the Tribunal’s
questions, Panama further argued that while the Tribunal is entitled to look at Chapter 15
of the TPA in trying to interpret the meaning of “intellectual property rights”, in doing
so, the Tribunal should bear in mind that (i) Chapter 15 cannot simply be fitted in into
Article 10.29, because in many instances that does not make sense, for example, because
Chapter 15 contemplates “international law rights”; and (ii) the question first and
foremost is whether there is an “investment”, not whether there is an “intellectual
property right.”!°

In the Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent takes issue again with the argument that
BSAM’s investment consists of the “intellectual property rights” to use the Panamanian
BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks resulting from the 2001 license
agreements (C-048 and C-052).'*°

First, the Respondent disputes the connection the Claimants seek to draw between the
above-mentioned rights with the sale activities of BSCR. Panama points out that the only
document in the record that authorizes BSCR to manufacture or sell products using a
trademark licensed by BSAM or one of its subsidiaries is a January 2015 sublicense
agreement (C-049) that: (i) post-dates that date of the alleged TPA violations, and (ii)
only relates to Costa Rican trademark registrations, applications and unregistered
trademarks. Panama submits that there is no evidence in the record that BSCR has been
using or has the right to use Panamanian trademarks, nor is there evidence that BSAM or

other subsidiary is selling tires in Panama. '*!

131. Second, Panama argues that beyond the right to use the Panamanian trademarks, the
“few” connections BSAM has to Panama, cannot be characterized as an “investment”
because:'*? (i) the patent underlying the Bandag Agreement has expired, and there is no
evidence that the agreement is still in force or that royalty payments are being made; and
(ii) BSCR’s sales of foreign-manufactured tires to third party dealers and distributors in
Panama and activities in connection with those sales are ordinary commercial

transactions that do not qualify as an “investment.” >

132. Third, the argument that the right to use Panamanian trademarks on tires (which neither
BSAM or its subsidiaries appears to be exercising) amounts to an “investment” fails
because: (i) if sales are not investments, the right to conduct sales is not one either; and
(ii) the TPA requires more than the mere existence of an “intellectual property right”,
and the rights contemplated in the contracts in C-048 and C-052 do not constitute an

“asset” that BSAM owns or controls directly or indirectly. "4

133. Finally, Panama explains that an asset is “‘an item of property owned by a person or
company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments or
legacies”, and argues that: (i) there is nothing in the record indicating that BSAM’s right
qualifies as “property” under Panamanian law; (ii) the evidence shows that such right is
not available to meet debts because absent approval from the licensor, the license cannot
be assigned for any purpose.!°> And, in any event, Panama argues, even if this right was

an “asset”, it is not owned or controlled by BSAM or its subsidiary.'*°

b. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants request that the Tribunal dismiss this objection.'°’ According to their last
submission, the objection should be dismissed for either of the following alternative
reasons: (i) it is intertwined with the merits, and all the necessary evidence is not before
the Tribunal such that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of proof; or (ii) if the
Tribunal considers that it has sufficient evidence before it to decide the objection safely,

then it should conclude that BSAM has a qualifying investment in Panama.'**

The Claimants assert that “BSAM’s core investment is its intellectual property rights [...]
in the Panamanian BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks, which are owned by
[...] BSJ [...] and BSLS, respectively, but which have been licensed to BSAM for use,
manufacture, sale, and distribution”, and argue that those meet the definition of
“investment”? in the TPA and the requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention.!?

There is no dispute that in an ICSID arbitration the activity in question must be both an
“investment” under the relevant treaty, and meet the requirements in Article 25(1) of the

ICSID Convention. !© Referring to the so-called “Salini test”, the Claimants note that:

“[...] numerous tribunals have applied [it] to determine whether
investors have an investment within the meaning of the applicable
treaty and under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. However,
while some tribunals have held that all of the components listed in
the Salini test have to exist in order to find an investment, the
language of the TPA, given its natural and ordinary meaning,
makes clear that the criteria are merely examples of the
characteristics of an investment, such that an investment may
include some of these characteristics but not necessarily all of
them. The list is also non-exhaustive, so other characteristics may
be taken into account; clearly, the intention of the drafters was that
‘investment’ be interpreted broadly.” !°!

For the Claimants, “the definition of investment in the TPA and Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention must be understood together’ and given that the TPA “contains a
comprehensive and expansive definition of ‘investment,’ [...], it would make little sense if

Article 25(1) of ICSID operated to limit the scope of the TPA.”!©

The Claimants contend that an interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in
accordance with its ordinary meaning leads to the conclusion that “rights to royalty
payments” and “trademarks” fall under Article 25.'° Further, in their Response on
Expedited Objections, the Claimants argued, by reference to their prior submission
during registration of the Request for Arbitration, that “BSAM’s [...] intellectual property
rights in Panama {...] fall within the definition of ‘investment’ at Article 10.29(f) of the
[TPA]” and that BSAM’s “revenue-sharing and license rights in Panama [...] fall within
the definition of ‘investment’ at Article 10.29(e) and Article 10.29(g) of the [TPA].”'®*

The Claimants add that in their Request for Arbitration and letter of 25 October 2016
they “[...] asserted that BSAM has (i) intellectual property rights; (ii) revenue sharing
rights; (iii) and license rights in Panama, and that these assets involve (i) an assumption
of risk; (ii) substantial capital expenditure; and (iii) an expectation of profit or gain.
[...]”, and also explained that BSAM has held these investments for over 16 years.'©
For the Claimants, these are “clear factual allegations about the nature of the investments
held by BSAM” that the Tribunal must assume as true in accordance with the mechanism
in Article 10.20.5 of the TPA, the only remaining issue for the Tribunal being “whether

these assets can properly be considered to be covered investments.” '

However, and without prejudice to their primary position on the applicable evidentiary

standard, the Claimants say that they have provided further details about BSAM’s

investment and answers to Respondent’s allegations relating to facts pertaining to this

objection.'©”

First, the Claimants note that BSAM itself and through its wholly-owned direct and
indirect subsidiaries is involved in various activities in Panama; and explain that “it is the

totality of these activities that together amount to BSAM’s investment’, with the

“intellectual property rights” being the “core investment around which these other

activities revolve.”'%

Second, the Claimants assert that the licenses appended to their 25 October 2016 letter
were only an “illustration” of BSAM’s intellectual property rights. While arguing that no
further evidence is required at this stage, the Claimants’ Response on Expedited
Objections provides further information about BSAM’s intellectual property investment

in Panama, '® and submits that:

e BSAM has “intellectual property rights” comprised of the two 2001 licenses,
namely, the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License (C-052) and the FIRESTONE
Trademark License (C-048).!° The BRIDGESTONE Trademark License was
granted by BSJ to a predecessor of Bridgestone American Tire Operations
(“BATO”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BSAM. It confers rights, inter alia, over
BSJ’s Panamanian trademarks,'’! and it is under this trademark that “BSAM
undertakes all of its activities in Panama — the sale and distribution of tires bearing
the BRIDGESTONE mark, and the marketing and training activities [...].”' The
FIRESTONE Trademark License is granted by BSLS to a predecessor of BSAM,
confers rights over BSLS’s FIRESTONE trademarks in Panama, and gives BSAM
the right to “use the Marks” on the Western Hemisphere except the United States. !7*

e Contrary to the Respondent’s position, “there is no requirement in the TPA that an
intellectual property right create a right protected under domestic law” because the
provision referring to domestic law is in item (g) of the definition of “investment” in
Article 10.29 on “licenses”, and not in item (f) on “intellectual property rights.”'™*

In any event, the Claimants contend, the FIRESTONE Trademark License does
create a right protected under Panamanian law.'7> Although the license is governed
by U.S. law, BSLS’s FIRESTONE trademark in Panama is protected under
Panamanian law, and the FIRESTONE Trademark License licenses that Panamanian
law right to BSAM.!7° Similarly, the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License licenses
to BSAM’s subsidiary (BATO) the BRIDGESTONE Panamanian law right, and
both BATO and BSAM’s rights are recognized under Panamanian law.'7”

“BSAM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries” carry out a wide range of activities in
support of BSAM’s core investments (i.e. the intellectual property rights contained
in the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE Trademark Licenses). The Claimants
explain that “BSAM sub-licenses its intellectual property rights to its wholly-owned
subsidiary, [...] BSCR [...], which manufactures, sells, markets and distributes
BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE tires throughout the region, including in
Panama.”'”® According to the Claimants, BSAM sets the marketing activities at the
regional level, and those are implemented locally by BSCR (pre-October 2015) and
now by another entity called Bridgestone Latin American North (“BS-LAN”).!”
BSAM (through BSCR and BS-LAN) has spent an estimated US$469,417 in
marketing activities in Panama. !*°

BSAM also has “revenue sharing rights” and “licenses in Panama’ through its
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Bridgestone Bandag LLC (formerly Bandag Inc.).
This refers to the franchise agreement between Bridgestone Bandag LLC and
Bandag de Panama S.A., a Panamanian entity, that allows such local entity to use a
patented method, trademarked apparatus and supplies to offer retreading services in
Panama. Bridgestone Bandag LLC receives royalties, and the Panamanian entity is
required to make minimum supply purchases.'*! Sales and marketing is carried out
by BSCR.!*

The Claimants also argue that BSAM’s assets in Panama have the “characteristics of an
investment.” 8
© = =Commitment of Capital and Other Resources. According to the Claimants, BSAM
has committed substantial amounts of capital to its investments in Panama as well as

non-monetary resources, in relation to marketing and sale activities.'*4 Both type of
contributions are to be considered, and as there is no monetary threshold in the TPA,
no large expenses are needed, and the only requirement is that the investor’s
commitment has “some economic value.”'®> Further, BSCR has contributed non-
monetary resources, by employing personnel tasked specifically with Panama’s sales
and marketing, who travel to Panama to perform their duties including provision of
know-how to local distributors and customers.!*° Lastly, “capital is being committed
to obtaining the intellectual property rights, i.e. the assets, through royalty
payments”;'8’ which is different from the capital committed to sale and distribution
of the tires, and “it is the brands that BSAM is spending capital to use and
market.”

e = Expectation of Gain and Profit. The Claimants argue that BSAM’s investments were
made with the expectation of gain and profit because: (i) the licenses were granted to
BSAM and its subsidiaries “so that BSAM could make money in Panama by selling
tires”, and (ii) BSAM’s subsidiary entered into the franchise agreement with Bandag
de Panama S.A. with the expectation that it would earn money. '*?

e Assumption of Risk. For the Claimants, the existence of an investment dispute is an
indication of risk. Further, the Supreme Court decision of May 2014 created a
significant risk for BSAM, namely, that the “dilution of the value [of the]
trademark’ will result in trademark infringements and competing registrations, and
reduce sales and decrease profits in Panama. In addition, the Claimants contend,
BSAM faces risk in “its activities including payment risk” from customers and
distributors for the tires shipped to Panama.'”°

e Duration. The Claimants argue that BSAM meets this criterion as: (i) it has held its
investments based on the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE Trademark Licenses
since 2001; (ii) it “has sold into Panama for decades’; (iii) its wholly-owned
subsidiary BSCR has been in charge of the Panama market since 1997, and has a
distribution agreement to sell tires in Panama that dates back to 1979; and (iv) the
franchise agreement with Bandag de Panama S.A. dates back to 1965.'9!

Referring to the issue whether BSAM could take credit from the activities of its
subsidiaries to show that it has an asset with the characteristics of an investment, the

Claimants observe that: (i) the licensee (BSAM or BATO, depending on the license) is

the ultimate party responsible under the license regardless of sub-licenses; and (ii) BAM
itself commits capital and other resources to its asset, as it sets and funds the marketing

strategy, and employs Mr. Kingsbury. '*

145. The Claimants further address the Respondent’s contention that BSAM’s alleged
investment is simply cross-border sales in Panama that do not qualify as an investment.
The Claimants accept that cross-border sales on their own could not be an investment, but
argue that “cross border sales are part of the activities in Panama in which BSAM is
engaged on the basis of its intellectual property investment.”'> Thus, while cross-border

sales are not themselves an investment, the Claimants argue, they “can be part of the

 

activities of an investor.”'°* These sales “are only made possible” and are “legally
protected’ by “the Claimants’ inves in P ian-registered de k
rights,”'°

146. The Claimants also deny that the “thrust” of their argument is that BSCR’s sales of tires
into Panama, rights thereto and activities therewith is the qualifying investment.!°° They
contend that they have provided information on sales and marketing activity “to explain

ities associated with BSAM’s investments

[Jt Their position is, the Claimants insist, that “BSAM’s investment in Panama is
its registered intellectual property rights, which are rights to sell and market tires under
the Panamanian-registered BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks, and the right
to pursue remedies against infringers of such marks under Panamanian law.”'> These

Panamanian-granted intellectual property rights are “assets”, they argue. '”

The Claimants do no dispute that to establish there is a covered investment, they must
“identify [...] an ‘asset,’ in the territory of the host State, ‘that an investor owns or
controls, directly or indirectly,’ at the time of the alleged treaty violation, ‘that has the
characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of
capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk’”,
and insist that this is what they have shown.” They go on to explain that “such
investment may take the form of one of those listed in Article 10.29” and note that, with

respect to BSAM, such investment is its “intellectual property rights.”?°' The Claimants

further accept that the investment must be “an investment in Panama.”?°?

In connection with the above points, the Claimants further explain that:

e They have identified an “asset” that BSAM’s “owned or controlled” at the time of
the 28 May 2014 Supreme Court decision, namely, the 1 December 2001
BRIDGESTONE Trademark License (C-052) and FIRESTONE Trademark License
(C-048).2° They note that “[s]pecifically, BSAM is the named rights holder in the
FIRESTONE Trademark License [...], while BSAM’s wholly-owned subsidiary, [...]

BATO [...], is the named rights holder in the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License
[...].7204

e The Respondent has misunderstood the nature of the “asset” when arguing that the
lack of ownership is demonstrated by the fact that BSAM needed to license it from
third parties. The BRIDEGESTONE and FIRESTONE Trademark Licenses are
themselves the “assets that are owned by BSAM [...] which constitute Panamanian
intellectual property rights”, and “the asset is the license, because it is the license
that confers on the licensee Panamanian intellectual property rights.”?°

e The issue whether BSAM’s intellectual property rights under a Panamanian
trademark registration conferred by the FIRESTONE Trademark License constitute
“assets in Panama owned by BSAM” is a question of Panamanian law.?°°

license is an intellectual property right in that trademark; (ii) the license granting
such intellectual property right need not be granted under Panamanian law in order
to be effective; and (iii) such intellectual property right is an asset owned by the
holder of that right’;?°> and “a trademark license holder may sue under its
agreement in the Panamanian courts and enforce its rights against third parties.”?

e The Tribunal should be guided by the substance and not the nomenclature of
Panamanian law.?!° And “in substance” the intellectual property rights conferred by
the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE Trademark Licenses are owned directly and
indirectly by BSAM.?!! The Claimants explain that, while Ms. Williams indicated at
the Hearing that “ownership of IP rights is always considered to remain with the
original trademark owner, in substance it is plain that the licensee of intellectual
property rights owns those rights subject to the terms of the license.”*'* Indeed, “the
licensee is the one who may use and benefit from those rights” and therefore, it is the
licensee who by virtue of the license “owns or controls the right to use and
commercially exploit the mark in the territory.”?"

e The terms of the two license agreements also support the conclusion that BSAM
directly and indirectly controls the intellectual property rights conferred by the
agreements, even though control is not unfettered.*'4 The Claimants note, for
example, that BSAM has control over how to commercially exploit the license, how
to use the license, how to market and promote tires, who to sub-license, and it must
exercise quality control over the products.?!°

e BSAM’s rights are transferrable, and while this requires the consent of the trademark
holder, that does not take way from BSAM’s ownership and control.?!¢

e BSAM’s intellectual property rights “are in Panama” because they are “deriving
from trademarks registered in Panama.”?"”

“intellectual property rights” does not arise because the Claimants have failed to

demonstrate that BSAM has an “assef” that it owns or controls.?!®

In their Post-Hearing
Brief the Claimants reiterate, “[t]o be clear”, that their case is that “the assets owned or
controlled by BSAM are the intellectual property rights conferred by the FIRESTONE
Trademark License Agreement and the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License Agreement”
and argue the question is then whether those license agreements and intellectual property
rights are “assets.”?!° The Claimants accept that the term asset refers to “items of value
and available to meet debts”, and argue that both licenses are of value because they allow
BSAM to use the marks to generate revenue. The Claimants dispute, however, that the
test to determine whether something is an “asset” depends on whether it can be sold. In
any event, the Claimants argue, contrary to the Respondent’s allegation that these
licenses cannot be sold, the licenses can indeed be converted to cash as they can be
assigned to another for consideration. That the licensor must agree to the assignment

does not deprive the license rights of value.?”°

Finally, with regard to the issue whether the term “intellectual property rights” in the

TPA refers only to the trademarks themselves or also encompasses the right to use the

trademarks, ~*' the Claimants:

e Remark that Article 10.29 refers to “intellectual property rights” as distinguished
from “intellectual property.”

e Note that the term “intellectual property rights” is not defined in Chapter 10 or
Chapter 15 of the TPA, but argue relying on the applicable law provision in Article
10.22.1 of the TPA, that there is useful context in the TPA that can assist the
Tribunal. The Claimants refer to Article 15.2.10, Article 15.11.6 and footnote 20, as
support for the distinction between “intellectual property (i.e. the trademark)” and
“intellectual property rights.”

whether they were “intellectual property rights” falling under Article 10.29(f).
Further, Panama has also implied that the only intellectual property right that could
be an asset is the trademark, thereby conflating intellectual property with intellectual
property rights.?74

Dispute the allegation that the purpose of a trademark license is to allow the licensee
to use the “good will” of the brand, and that BSAM not having rights to that “good
will” it does not have any “intellectual property rights.’ The purpose of the
trademark license is to allow use of the trademark, a right which the licensee owns
and controls, pays for, and receives benefits from, though manufacturing and selling
branded products.?75

Argue that the present situation has parallels to oil exploration and production

licenses, in which the licensee does not own the concession area, but it does own the

The U.S. Submissions

its Article 10.20.2 submission, the United States refers to the definition of

“investment” in Article 10.29 of the TPA. It observes that such definition encompasses

“every asset” owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by an investor that has the

characteristics of an investment; and notes that the categories listed in the sub-paragraphs

of the definition “are illustrative and non-exhaustive.”*"” The United States further adds

that:

“In determining whether an asset falls within the definition, the
analysis should be guided by whether it has the characteristics of
an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of
capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the
assumption of risk.”?28

It also points out that “[o]rdinary commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services

typically do not fall within the list in subparagraph (e)’, and that “[t]he definition of

‘investment’ explicitly excludes claims to payment that arise from commercial contracts

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

a. Introduction

Because the Tribunal is making a final finding on this issue, the burden of proof lies
fairly and squarely on BSAM to demonstrate that it owns or controls a qualifying
investment.?*’ That is a burden that BSAM must discharge according to the normal

standard of proof, namely on balance of probabilities.

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides: “[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall
extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment [...].” It follows that the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal requires first that each Claimant should have an “investment”
and secondly that any dispute raised by a Claimant should “arise directly’ out of that

investment.

The Claimants’ claims have been brought under the ICSID Convention pursuant to
Section B of Chapter 10 of the TPA. Chapter 10 of the TPA applies to “covered

investments.” These are defined in Article 10.29 as follows:

“investment means every asset that an investor owns or controls,
directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment,
including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or
other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption
of risk. Forms that an investment may take include:

(a) an enterprise

(b) shares, stocks, and other forms of equity participation in an
enterprise;

March 2013) (hereinafter, “Tulip”], { 48; and RLA-049, National Gas S.A.E. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, \CSID

(c) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans;
(d) futures, options and other derivatives;

(e) turnkey, construction, management, production, concession,
revenue- sharing, and other similar contracts;

(f) intellectual property rights;

(g) licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred
pursuant to domestic law; and

(h) other tangible or intangible, moveable or immovable property,
and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens and
pledges.”?*!

156. A footnote to (g) provides:

“Whether a particular type of license, authorization, permit or
similar instrument (including a concession, to the extent that it has
the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an
investment depends on such factors as the nature and extent of the
rights that the holder has under the law of the Party. Among the
licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar instruments that do
not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not
create any rights protected under domestic law. For greater
certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset
associated with the license, authorization, permit or similar
instrument has the characteristic of an investment.”
157. It is common ground that the Tribunal will only have jurisdiction in relation to a claim
brought by BSAM if (i) there is an “investment” out of which the dispute directly arises
within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; and (ii) that “investment” also

falls within the definition in Article 10.29 of the TPA.

158. The ICSID Convention contains no definition of “investment.” There is much
jurisprudence and academic discussion as to whether the meaning of “investment” in the
ICSID Convention can be more restrictive than the definition of “investment” in a BIT or
other agreement under which the jurisdiction of the Centre is invoked. In this case,

however, the Parties have directed their arguments in relation to Panama’s Objection No.

1 to the question of whether BSAM’s claim relates to an investment that falls within the
definition in Article 10.29 of the TPA. This is understandable. The Tribunal finds it hard
to envisage an investment within the definition in Article 10.29 of the TPA that would

not qualify as an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

159. This area of dispute between the Parties has fallen into a narrow compass. BSLS is the
owner of the FIRESTONE trademark that is registered in Panama. At least for the
purposes of the present expedited proceedings, Panama accepts that this registered
trademark qualifies as an “investment” under Article 10.29 of the TPA. BSLS has
granted BSAM a license to use that FIRESTONE trademark in Panama. BSAM contends
that this license constitutes an “investment” as defined by Article 10.29; Panama contends
that it does not. BATO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BSAM has, under the
BRIDGESTONE Trademark License, the license to use the BRIDGESTONE trademark
registered in Panama. BSAM contends that this is an “investment” within the definition

of Article10.29 of the TPA that BSAM controls. Panama contends that it is not.

160. Thus, the argument has largely focused on the differences between the ownership of the
relevant trademarks and the licenses to use these, and whether or not the latter satisfies
the definition of an “investment” in Article 10.29 of the TPA. Panama’s submissions did
not focus on the question of how or in what circumstances a registered trademark
qualifies as an investment.2*> That is, however, a seminal question that must be
addressed before it is possible to analyse the significance of the difference between

ownership of and a license to use a registered trademark.

161. The analysis of the issues arising in respect of this Objection is complicated by the
manner in which BSJ has delegated different aspects of its world-wide business to
subsidiary companies in the Group, all of which are wholly-owned, directly or indirectly,
by BSJ. Under international investment treaty law, subject always to the precise wording
of the applicable treaty, in principle, when considering whether an investment is owned
or controlled by a claimant in a chain of companies the corporate veil is withdrawn when

looking down the chain from the claimant, but the fact that all the benefits of the

164.

investment may ultimately pass up the chain to the parent is ignored. It is perfectly
legitimate for a group of companies so to structure their inter-relationship as to gain the
benefit of international investment treaties, subject always to the terms of the treaty
whose protection the relevant member of the group seeks to enjoy, such as the denial of
benefits provision that forms the subject of Objection No. 3, and any other provision that

bears on the standing of a particular claimant to gain access to international jurisdiction.

The Tribunal intends to approach Panama’s Objection No. | by considering a series of

questions:

e (1) In what circumstances does a trademark qualify as an investment?

e = (2) In what circumstances, if any, are the FIRESTONE Trademark License and the
BRIDGESTONE Trademark License capable of qualifying as an investment?

e = (3) In the light of the answers to 1 and 2, was the FIRESTONE Trademark License
an investment in Panama owned or controlled by BSAM?

e (4) In the light of the answers to 1 and 2 was the BRIDGESTONE Trademark
License an investment in Panama owned or controlled by BAM?

b. In What Circumstances Does a Trademark Qualify as an Investment?

In this arbitration, BSLS claims in respect of the FIRESTONE trademark, which it owns.
For the purposes of these expedited proceedings, Panama has accepted that the
FIRESTONE trademark constitutes an investment in Panama that is owned by BSLS.
Panama has, however, been understandably reluctant to explain the basis on which this
concession has been made in order not to prejudice any subsequent challenge to BSLS’s

claim.7*4

What are the elements of an investment under the definition in Article 10.29 of the TPA?
First, the investment must be an “assef”’ that is capable of being owned or controlled.
The TPA lists a series of forms that an investment may take, including “intellectual

property rights” but there is an overriding requirement that the asset claimed to be an

24 Tr, Day 4, 524:16-525:12 (Ms. Silverman).

54

165.

166.

investment must have the “characteristics” of an investment. The TPA gives some

examples of these:

® commitment of capital or other resources;
e expectation of gain or profit;
e assumption of risk.

These are characteristics of an investment that have been identified in the abundant
investment treaty jurisprudence on the topic over the years and reduced to the text of the
TPA. The Claimants have accepted them as typical characteristics of an investment and

Panama has not demurred from this.

There are other characteristics to be found in many investments, as identified in Salini2>
such as a reasonable duration of the investment and a contribution made by the
investment to the host State’s development. The Tribunal is of the view, in agreement
with most previous decisions, that there is no inflexible requirement for the presence of

all these characteristics, but that an investment will normally evidence most of them.

A trademark is a type of intellectual property. BITs and modern FTAs commonly list
intellectual property within the definition of the assets that are, or are capable of being, an
investment. Sometimes trademarks are specifically included in the list, see for instance
Arif?*® and the Philip Morris case.?*” In the latter case the investments asserted by the

claimants specifically included trademarks.?°*

The tribunal dismissed Uruguay’s
objection that the claimants did not have investments in Uruguay that satisfied the
meaning of “investment” in the ICSID Convention. It did not, however, deal specifically
with trademarks. Nor has this Tribunal been referred to any other decision that considers

the circumstances in which a trademark can constitute an investment when it is

unaccompanied by other forms of investment such as the acquisition of shares in a
company incorporated under the law of the host State, the acquisition of real property, or
the acquisition of other assets commonly associated with the establishment of an

investment.

167. A trademark identifies the features that a consumer will expect to find in a product that
bears the mark. Where consumers consider those features to be desirable, the trademark
enables the seller to profit from the goodwill that attaches to products that bear the
trademark. That goodwill can be generated in two ways. The first is by designing,
manufacturing and selling products that contain the desirable features. Consumers who
have appreciated these will wish to purchase further products that contain those features.

The trademark enables them to identify these.

168. The other way of generating goodwill is by promoting the brand by advertising and other
means so that the purchaser is led to anticipate that an article bearing the trademark will

contain those desirable features.

169. Whichever way the trademark is promoted, the promotion involves the commitment of
resources over a significant period, the expectation of profit and the assumption of the
risk that the particular features of the product may not prove sufficiently attractive to

enable it to win or maintain market share in the face of competition.

239

170. Douglas states~” that there is no conceptual problem in recognizing intellectual property

rights as investments, but he does not explain why that is. He goes on to comment:74°

“[...] An intellectual property right is therefore negative in
character: it is a right to exclude others and corresponds to an
obligation in rem by which all subjects of the legal system have a
negative duty to refrain from exploiting an invention or
representing one’s business or its products by a certain name or
symbol and so on.”

171. It seems to the Tribunal that the mere registration of a trademark in a country manifestly

does not amount to, or have the characteristics of, an investment in that country. The

173.

174.

effect of registration of a trademark is negative. It prevents competitors from using that
trademark on their products. It confers no benefit on the country where the registration
takes place, nor, of itself, does it create any expectation of profit for the owner of the
trademark. No doubt for these reasons the laws of most countries, including Panama, do

not permit a trademark to remain on the register indefinitely if it is not being used.

The picture is, however, transformed if the trademark is exploited. A trademark is
exploited by the manufacture, promotion and sale of goods that bear the mark. The
exploitation accords to the trademark, by the activities to which the trademark is central,
the characteristics of an investment. It will involve devotion of resources, both to the
production of the articles sold bearing the trademark, and to the promotion and support of
those sales. It is likely also to involve after-sales servicing and guarantees. This
exploitation will also be beneficial to the development of the home State. The activities
involved in promoting and supporting sales will benefit the host economy, as will
taxation levied on sales. Furthermore, it will normally be beneficial for products that
incorporate the features that consumers find desirable to be available to consumers in the
host country. That was not the case in the Philip Morris case where the products in
question were cigarettes, but the tribunal nevertheless found that the activities that
included marketing the cigarettes under the trademark constituted a qualifying

investment.

There is another way in which the owner of a registered trademark may exploit it. The
owner may license the use of the trademark under a franchise agreement that grants to the

licensee the right to exploit the trademark for its own benefit.

The Tribunal concludes that a registered trademark will be a qualifying investment on the
part of the owner, provided that the owner carried out the activities that are normally
involved in the exploitation of the investment, as described above. In many investment

cases the tribunal has found the existence of a qualifying investment on the basis of a

number of interrelated transactions. The Philip Morris case is one. Another is CSOB?*!

cited by the Claimants.”4?

In the case of a trademark, the interrelated activities are likely to relate to selling products
bearing the mark. A simple sale is often taken as a paradigm example of a commercial

investment that cannot constitute an investment.*4? Panama argues from this that:

“[...] Rights, activities, commitments of capital and resources,

expectations of gain and profit, assumption of risk, and duration do

not add up an ‘investment’ when they are simply the rights,

activities, commitments, expectations, and risks associated with,

and the duration of, cross-border sales.”?44
Panama cites no authority to support this proposition and the Tribunal does not accept it.
The reason why a simple sale does not constitute an investment is that it lacks most of the
characteristics of an investment. It does not follow that an interrelated series of activities,
built round the asset of a registered trademark, that do have the characteristics of an
investment does not qualify as such simply because the object of the exercise is the
promotion and sale of marked goods. Contrary to Panama’s submission, the Tribunal
considers that to rule that such transactions could not qualify as an investment would be,

impermissibly, to prefer form to substance.

In summary, a registered trademark will constitute a qualifying investment provided that
it is exploited by its owner by activities that, together with the trademark itself, have the

normal characteristics of an investment.

c. In What Circumstances, if Any, Are the FIRESTONE Trademark License
and the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License Capable of Qualifying as an
Investment?

Under the footnote to Article 10.29 (g) of the TPA a license will not have the

characteristics of an investment unless it creates rights protected under domestic law, that

is under the law of the host State. No similar provision applies to (f) “intellectual
property rights”, but the Tribunal is in no doubt that they must be rights protected under
the law of Panama, otherwise they can neither properly be described as “intellectual

property rights”, nor as “assets.”

The respective Claimant must own or control, directly or indirectly, the rights granted by

each License.

The License must be exploited by the licensee in the same way as a trademark must be

exploited if it is to qualify as an investment, as above described.
d. Was the FIRESTONE Trademark License an Investment in Panama
Owned or Controlled by BSAM?

BSAM’s material contentions can be summarised as follows:

e (i) the FIRESTONE Trademark License fell within the definition both of
“intellectual property rights” under Article 10.29(f) of the TPA, and of a “license”
under Article 10.29(g);

e (ii) the rights granted by the License were protected under the law of Panama;

e — (iii) the total of the activities carried on by BSAM in relation to those rights, coupled
with the License itself as the core investment, had the characteristics of an

investment.

Panama’s material contentions can be summarised as follows:

e (i) the rights granted by the License were so restricted that (a) they could not
properly be described as intellectual property rights, or a license, or an asset; and (b)
BSAM could not properly be said to own or control the rights;

e (ii) the rights were not recognized or protected by the law of Panama;

e (iii) the rights were not in Panama;

e (iv) there were insufficient activities carried on by BSAM in Panama under or in
relation to the License to give the two together the characteristics of an investment.

59

183. Panama drew attention to the following provisions of the FIRESTONE Trademark

License in support of the submissions summarised at (i) above:?*°

“5. [Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holding, Inc.] may use
Marks only on Licensed Products after receiving the written
approval of [BSLS] and only after [BSLS] has seen, inspected and
approved a sample of the use of each of the Marks as well as a
sample of each of the Licensed Products provided by
[Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holding, Inc], at its expense,
displaying the proposed usage of the Marks. Thereafter until
expiration of this Agreement, the Marks must only be used in the
style, font, color and manner as required by [BSLS].

[J

11. [Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holding, Inc.] agrees that
[BSLS] owns of [sic] the Marks and all the goodwill associated
therewith. [BSLS] shall retain all right, title and interest in and to
the Marks, the goodwill associated therewith, and all registrations
granted thereon. Any and all uses of the Marks by
[Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holdings, Inc.] shall inure to the
benefit of [BSLS]. [...]”

184. As a matter of form these provisions make the use of the license conditional upon the
grant of written approval by BSLS, and grant BSLS powers to regulate the use of the
license by BSAM. The Tribunal does not accept, however, that the effect of this was to
render it impossible to describe the FIRESTONE Trademark License as intellectual
property rights or as a license, or as an asset, or as being owned or controlled by BSAM.
Once the necessary consents were given, and subject to the law of Panama which is
considered below, the FIRESTONE Trademark License conferred on BSAM the valuable
right to sell tires bearing the FIRESTONE mark in Panama. In practice, that right was
granted to BSAM exclusively. The exercise of that right would inevitably result in
BSAM benefitting from the goodwill that attached to the mark, notwithstanding that the
FIRESTONE Trademark License provided that BSLS would retain the title to the
goodwill.

185. The provision that the use of the marks should “inure to the benefit” of BSLS is puzzling
and was not explored. The Tribunal would not accept, were it to be suggested, that this
245 Resp. Reply Exp. Obj., 37, n. 161 citing C-048, FIRESTONE Trademark License, Art. 5 and Art. 11.

60

required BSAM to account to BSLS for any profits earned from sales under the
FIRESTONE Trademark License of tires bearing the FIRESTONE mark. Even if it had,
this would not have detracted from the fact that the FIRESTONE Trademark License
granted BSAM the right to use the FIRESTONE mark in Panama, when this would
otherwise have been prevented by the registration of the mark. What happens to the
fruits of an investment after they have been harvested does not impact on the value of

those fruits.

186. While the FIRESTONE Trademark License made it clear that BSAM was not granted
any interest in the FIRESTONE mark itself, BSAM was granted the contractual right to
use the mark. If that right can properly be described as an “asset”, then the FIRESTONE
Trademark License made BSAM the owner of that asset. That question depends, in the
view of the Tribunal, on the effect under the law of Panama of the FIRESTONE

Trademark License.

187. Evidence of Panamanian law was given by Ms. Audrey Williams. Panama objected to
her giving evidence as an independent expert, because she had previously been part of
the Claimants’ legal team. Her evidence was given, without objection, for what it might
be worth. In the event, Panama did not suggest that her evidence was influenced by bias

and, indeed has sought to rely on it.

188. Ms. Williams set out the relevant Panamanian law in her witness statement. She

translated the following extract from Law No. 35 of 1996:

“Article 121: The owner of a registered trademark can grant, by
means of a contract, a license to use the trademark in favor of one
or several persons in connection with all or part of the goods or
services covered by the registration. The owner of the registered
trademark can reserve the right to simultaneously use the
trademark.”™4°

189. Ms. Williams in her statement commented:

“9. [...] Through operation of Article 121 a trademark registration
holder may therefore transfer their intellectual property rights with

26 Williams WS, 1 8. See also, C-127, Law No. 35 (10 May 1996), Art. 121.

61

respect to the use of the trademark to a licensee. It follows that the
person to whom the trademark rights have been licensed possesses
those trademark rights of use. While it is clear that the trademark
owner must grant such license by contract, it is not required that

13. In addition, the right to use the mark granted to the licensee
will also allow the licensee to participate in opposition and
annulment actions against identical and/or confusingly similar
trademarks as either a co-plaintiff or as a collaborating party of the
plaintiff. [...].”247

190. Ms. Williams’s witness statement also deals with the nature and effect of the use of a

trademark by a licensee, citing Article 101 of Law No. 35 of 1996, which, as translated

by Ms. Williams, provides, in relation to a trademark on goods:

“Use of a trademark is understood as the placement of products
bearing the mark in the national marketplace, whether they have
been produced, manufactured, made or finished in the Republic of
Panama or abroad. [...] The use of a mark by a licensee or by
another person authorized to do so shall be deemed as effected by
the owner of the registration, for all purpose related to the use of
the mark.”248

191. Ms. Williams commented at paragraph 12 of her statement:

“As the use of the trademark by the licensee will be considered the
same as use by the trademark owner, for all purposes for which the
use of the mark is relevant, the role of the licensee will be of
paramount importance. This is particularly the case when the
trademark owner is not using the mark itself or has no other
licensee in the territory. For instance, the use of the mark by the
licensee will make it possible to maintain the exclusivity of the
rights awarded under the registration certificate, as otherwise it can
be cancelled if the mark is not used for five consecutive years.
Therefore, the use made by the licensee can be enforced before a
court of law by the trademark owner to prevent the cancellation of
a trademark registration.”

192. Ms. Williams concluded her statement:

“In summary, the right to use a trademark granted to a licensee by
the owner of a trademark registered in Panama is a valuable asset,
and constitutes an intellectual property right under Panamanian
law.250

193. The cross-examination of Ms. Williams was very short. The relevant passage was as

follows:?>!

“Q. [...] I understand that one of the things that you’re saying is
that, under Panamanian law, the right to use a trademark granted to
a licensee is an ‘intellectual property’ right; is that correct?

A. Yes, it is

Q. [...] it also seems that you’re saying that Panamanian law
establishes that the right to use a trademark granted to a licensee is
a ‘valuable asset.’ Are you saying that with that sentence? Are you
saying that Panamanian law states that trademark rights granted to
a licensee are valuable assets?

A. No, Iam not saying that.”

194. Ms. Williams was asked about her meaning of “asset” and, in particular, whether the
intellectual property rights in a trademark license agreement were property that could be
converted to cash. She replied that this would depend on what the contract stated. In the

present case, the consent of the licensor was required.

195. On the basis of this evidence, the Tribunal concludes that under the law of Panama a
registered trademark constitutes intellectual property. If the owner licenses the use of the
trademark, the license constitutes an intellectual property right. The owner of the
trademark has to use the trademark to keep it alive, but use by the licensee counts as use
by the owner. The licensee cannot take proceedings to enforce the trademark without the

participation of the owner, but can join with the owner in enforcement proceedings. The

right is a right to use the Panamanian registered trademark in Panama. It follows that the

location of the right is Panama.

196. Panama advanced a further point in support of its argument that the right to use the
FIRESTONE trademark registered in Panama was not an asset and, therefore, could not
constitute an investment. This was that BSAM’s right was not “available to meet debts,
commitments or legacies”? because the FIRESTONE Trademark License prohibited
BSAM from assigning its license for any purpose absent the express approval of BSLS.
The Tribunal is not persuaded by this submission. In the first place, the Tribunal does not
accept that a contractual right cannot constitute an asset unless it is capable of
assignment. In the second place, the requirement to obtain consent to the assignment of
an asset does not mean that the asset is not assignable. In the circumstances of this case it
is not realistic to envisage BSAM seeking consent to assign its license to use the
FIRESTONE trademark, but in theory there was no reason why it should not have sought,

and obtained, such consent.

197. Panama argued that BSAM did not “own or control” the rights: “The mere fact that
Bridgestone Americas needed to license it from a third party demonstrates a lack of
ownership, and the terms of the agreement demonstrate a lack of control.”?>> The
Tribunal does not follow the first part of this submission. It is axiomatic that a license
must be obtained from the licensor, but that does not mean that the licensee does not own
the license. BSAM owned the license granted by BSLS. As to the second part of the
submission, the requirement is that the claimant should own or control the license. In
any event, although the terms of the license purported to impose quite strict control over
the use of the license, BSLS did not, in practice control the manner in which the license

was exploited.

198. For these reasons the Tribunal finds that the FIRESTONE Trademark License creates
rights that are protected under the law of Panama and is thus capable of constituting an
investment under Article 10.29 of the TPA. However, just as a registered trademark will

not, without more, constitute an investment, so a license to use a registered trademark
will not, without more, constitute an investment. In each case, exploitation of the

trademark is necessary in order to turn the relevant right into an investment.

The Tribunal turns to the question of whether, in demonstrating the exploitation of the
FIRESTONE trademark registered in Panama necessary to constitute an investment,
BSAM is entitled to claim credit for the various activities of BSCR in Panama in relation

to this.

Before looking at details of the evidence, the Tribunal will summarise its effect. BSAM
itself played a limited part in the activities that exploited the FIRESTONE trademark in
Panama. This consisted of involvement in the promotion of the mark. But the major
activities of promotion, the manufacture of the tires (which took place outside Panama)
and the sales of these tires bearing the FIRESTONE mark in Panama, were carried out by

BSCR.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Panama has submitted: “[t]here is no evidence that BSCR has
been using (or even had the right to use) Panamanian trademarks on tires. Nor is there
evidence that any other BSAM subsidiary (or BSAM itself) is selling tires into

Panama.”*+

There is a degree of conflict between this and Panama’s subsequent averment that BSCR
“sells foreign-manufactured tires to third party dealers and distributors in Panama, and
conducts certain activities in connection with these sales.”?°> The Tribunal assumes that
the former submission was directed at the absence of documentary evidence conferring
on BSCR the right to use the trademarks in Panama, for the witness statements of Mr.
Calderon and Mr. Hidalgo clearly establish that BSCR had been selling tires bearing the
FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE marks in Panama.

Mr. Calderon’s statement, from which the facts hereafter set out are taken, covers the

position before and after the reorganization of BSAM’s Latin America operations, which

254 Resp. PHB Exp. Obj, { 10.

206.

occurred in October 2015. The relevant period is before that reorganization, when Mr.
Calderon served as Marketing Manager for BSCR.?*° At that time BSAM had a
marketing team in Nashville that included Mr. Pineda, the Director of Latin American
Sales and Marketing. This team developed marketing initiatives for the BRIDGESTONE
and FIRESTONE brands in the entire Latin American region. These initiatives included
promotion and marketing campaigns. The team also set the regional strategy for the
brands that included event sponsorships, advertising campaigns, and market research.?*’

BSAM established the regional marketing budgets to fund these activities.

It fell to BSCR to implement the marketing strategies for the FIRESTONE and the
BRIDGESTONE brands in Panama. Implementation included advertisements in
publications, on radio and television and on the web, seasonal promotions, marketing
campaigns, and merchandising co-sponsorship.>* It is clear from Mr. Calderon’s
statement that all of these activities were designed to promote the sales by BSCR of, inter

alia, tires bearing the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE marks in Panama.

Mr. Hidalgo’s witness statement adds to the picture. He was BSCR’s Consumer Sales
Manager for Central America and the Caribbean between March 2011 and April 2014, at
which point he was promoted to become Commercial Director for Central America and
the Caribbean.*° This states that since about 2000 BSCR has manufactured tires in
Costa Rica and sold these under the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE marks in
Panama.” The largest dealer in Panama to whom BSCR sells tires is Tambor S.A.
(“Tambor”).”°! In 2013 and 2014 sales to Tambor exceeded US$5 million in value, in

2015 this dropped to about US$3.9 million and in 2016 to about US$2.7 million.?°

Mr. Hidalgo states that the last written agreement with Tambor was concluded in 1979

and expired in 1996, after which the relationship continued on the same basis with the

“relevant Bridgestone entity’ which, in recent times has been BSAM and its

subsidiaries.”

Although there is at least one piece missing from the jig-saw, the overall picture is clear.
In 2001 BSJ reorganized the manner in which the American Firestone business that it had
acquired was organized. Ownership of the many registered trademarks were transferred
to BSLS. That company’s role, as its name suggests, was not itself to exploit those
trademarks but to protect them and to delegate the exploitation of the marks by license to
BSAM. BSAM’s role in its turn was to oversee marketing activities under which the
marks were exploited and promoted in the various countries, but to delegate to its
subsidiaries the actual exploitation of the marks by the sale of tires bearing them. In

respect of Panama, BSCR was the company to which this function was delegated.

The missing piece of the jig-saw is the absence of any document evidencing the
delegation to BSCR of the exploitation of the right to use the FIRESTONE mark that had
been conferred on BSAM by the FIRESTONE Trademark License. One might have
expected a sub-license granted by BSAM to BSCR to have been produced. As Panama
has pointed out, the Claimants have placed on the record a number of licenses or sub-

licenses that have no direct relevance.

What is the proper conclusion to be drawn by the Tribunal from the absence of a
document of any kind from BSAM authorizing BSCR to market tires bearing the
FIRESTONE mark in Panama? There are two possibilities. The first is that such a
document exists or existed but the Claimants or their lawyers have been unable to find it.
The second is that no such document has ever existed. Either explanation suggests a
degree of disarray on the part of the Bridgestone Group. There is other evidence of such
disarray. Counsel for the Claimants told the Tribunal that it would probably take several
days to produce a chart showing the interrelationship of all the companies in the

Bridgestone Group.**+ Perhaps more significant is the fact that for the last 20 years

212.

Bridgestone companies have been selling to Tambor large quantities of tires without such

sales being covered by any written agreement.

The Tribunal has concluded that it does not matter whether the document under which
BSAM granted authority to BSCR to sell tires bearing the FIRESTONE trademark in
Panama has been lost or whether it has never existed. BSLS entered into the
FIRESTONE Trademark License with BSAM in order to confer on BSAM the right,
either directly or through its subsidiaries, to sell tires bearing the FIRESTONE mark in
countries where the mark was registered. In reliance on that right, BSAM has procured
BSCR to sell tires bearing the FIRESTONE mark in Panama and has itself assisted with
the marketing of those tires. Whether or not BSCR acted under a formal sub-license
granted by BSAM, it was plainly authorized by BSAM to act as it did. The Tribunal
notes the recognition in Article 101 of Law No. 35 that the use of a trademark by a
person authorized to use it is deemed to be effected by the owner. The Tribunal is
satisfied that BSAM can properly be treated as having, itself and through BSCR, been
exploiting its right to sell tires bearing the FIRESTONE trademark in Panama, and has
thereby invested directly and through its subsidiary in Panama. The FIRESTONE

Trademark License was thus an investment in Panama owned by BSAM.

e. Was the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License an Investment in Panama
Owned or Controlled by BSAM?

To a large extent, the issues raised by this question mirror those already discussed in
relation to the FIRESTONE Trademark License. The difference is that the
BRIDGESTONE Trademark License granted a license to use the BRIDGESTONE
trademark not to BSAM but to BATO, a wholly owned subsidiary of BSAM, and unlike
the FIRESTONE trademark, which is owned by BSLS outside of the United States, the
BRIDGESTONE trademark is owned by BSJ, a Japanese entity that holds no rights under
the TPA.

BSJ adopted a similar approach to the exploitation of BRIDGESTONE registered
trademarks as was adopted in relation to the FIRESTONE registered trademarks. By
Article 2.1 of the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License dated 1 December 2001, BSJ

68

213.

214.

215.

216.

granted a license to the predecessor of BATO, a wholly owned subsidiary of BSAM, to
use “BSJ Trademarks in relation to all Tire Products within the United States of America
and elsewhere as provided for in Article 2-2 [...].”?® Article 2.2 provided that the BSJ
Trademarks could only be sub-licensed to the parties listed in Exhibit A. The parties so

listed included Bridgestone/Firestone de Costa Rica S.A.

Article 4.1 of the Agreement required that the licensee “shall actually use” the
trademarks “for the purpose of giving adequate trademark notice in the jurisdiction of

intended use.”?°°

The BRIDGESTONE Trademark License contained similar restrictions in respect of the
use of the trademark as the FIRESTONE Trademark License. Despite this, and for the
reasons given when considering the FIRESTONE Trademark License, the Tribunal finds
that the right to use the trademarks was indirectly owned and controlled by BSAM as the
owner of 100% of BATO.

The use that was actually made of the BRIDGESTONE trademark registered in Panama
was by BSCR. There is no document on the record that evidences the grant of authority
by BATO to BSCR to use that trademark. Mr Williams suggested that it was a comment
from the Tribunal that drew attention to the lack of evidence about the activities of
BATO. The Tribunal considers that the fact that this was an important part of the story
should have been apparent from the outset. What inferences are properly to be drawn
from the absence of such evidence? The natural inference that flows from the grant of the
sublicense by BATO to BSCR in 2015 is that no such sublicense existed before that date.
Yet BSCR was busy promoting and selling in Panama tires bearing the BRIDGESTONE

trademark.

The comments that the Tribunal has made in respect of the lack of documentation in
respect of the use made by BSCR of the FIRESTONE mark apply equally here. As
BATO and BSCR were both wholly owned by BSAM and BSAM assisted in the

promotion of the sales made by BSCR, the obvious inference is that BATO authorised

265 C052, BRIDGESTONE Trademark License, Art. 2.1.
266 C052, BRIDGESTONE Trademark License, Art. 4.1.

69

217.

218.

BSCR to use the right that BATO enjoyed under the BRIDGESTONE Trademark
License to market tires under the BRIDGESTONE mark. The activities carried on in
respect of the use of this right, coupled with the right itself, constituted an investment that
BSAM, as BATO’s parent, indirectly owned and controlled. It follows that the
BRIDGESTONE Trademark License was an investment in Panama owned or controlled

by BSAM.

The Tribunal has reached these conclusions on the balance of probability on the basis of
the evidence before it and those parts of the Claimants’ pleadings that Panama itself
relied on. The Tribunal is satisfied that the result accords with reality. Had BSJ and
BSLS, as owners respectively of the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks
registered in Panama, themselves carried out all the activities relating to the use of those
trademarks on tires sold in Panama, each would have established an investment in
Panama, albeit that BSJ would not have enjoyed the benefit of protection under the TPA.
Each, however, passed to BSAM, under the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE
Trademark Licenses, the rights that they enjoyed as owners of the trademarks, in order
that the exploitation of the trademarks should be made pursuant to these rights. BSAM,
itself and through its wholly owned subsidiaries, carried out the various activities
involved in exploiting those rights. Those activities, together with the rights under which
they were permitted to take place, had the characteristics of investments. The rights to
use the trademarks were at the heart of those investments. They were rights in respect of
intellectual property, granted under licenses, and they fell within the list of forms that an
investment may take, as tabled in Article 10.29 of the TPA. The conclusion that they

were investments in Panama owned by BSAM follows naturally.

The Claimants adduced a body of evidence in relation to the grant by Bridgestone
Bandag LLC (formerly Bandag Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of BATO, to an
unrelated Panamanian company of a franchise to use a patented method, and a Bandag
trademark, in respect of the provision of tire retreading services in Panama.”*’ It was not

clear to the Tribunal how this evidence was supposed to bear on the issue of whether the

222.

223.

FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE Trademark Licenses qualified as investments. The

Tribunal found it of no assistance in resolving that issue.

f. Summary

Where the owner of a trademark licenses its use to a licensee, it is necessary to
distinguish carefully between the interest of the owner and the interest of the licensee,
each of which may be capable of constituting an investment. If the owner does no more
than grant a license of the trademark, in consideration of the payment of royalties by the
licensee, the value of the trademark to the owner will reflect the amount of royalties
received, while the value of the license to the licensee will reflect the fruits of the

exploitation of the trademark, out of which the royalties are paid.

Thus, in the present case, the claim of BSLS, as the owner of the FIRESTONE

trademark, must be distinguished from the claim of BSAM, as licensee of that trademark.

So far as the BRIDGESTONE trademark is concerned, BSJ, as owner, has no claim
because, being a Japanese company, it falls outside the protection of the TPA. BSAM’s
claim as indirect owner and controller of the license enjoyed by BATO, mirrors its claim

as licensee of the FIRESTONE trademark.

So far as the Tribunal is aware, this is the first case in which it has been necessary to

analyse the different types of investments that can arise in relation to trademarks.

Second Objection: BSAM Does Not Have a Dispute “Arising Directly Out” of An
Investment

(1) The Parties’ Positions

a. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that even if BSAM had an investment, the present dispute does

not arise directly out of that investment as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID

71

224.

Convention, because there is no “immediate ‘cause and effect” or “causal link” between

the host-State actions at issue and the effects of such actions on the alleged investment.”

The Respondent notes that this arbitration arises out of a Panama Supreme Court’s
decision imposing a US$ 5,431,000 penalty on BSJ and BSLS, later paid by BSLS, in the
context of a domestic proceeding initiated by a Panamanian and a Chinese entity for
injuries resulting from efforts by BSJ and BSLS to police the BRIDGESTONE and
FIRESTONE trademarks.”° The alleged US$16 million loss claimed here is said to
result from the penalty imposed by the Panama Supreme Court in that proceeding plus

the “diminution of value of the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks.”?”

But there is no direct link between BSAM’s purported investment and the injury the
Claimants allege, Panama argues, because: BSAM was not a party to the Panamanian
court proceeding, it did not pay (nor did it have an obligation to pay) the penalty imposed
by the Supreme Court, it does not own the BRIDGESTONE or FIRESTONE trademarks,
and it did not have the authority to police them.”! At most, Respondent contends,
BSAM had a right to sell, market and distribute products under those trademarks in
Panama and the Americas, but the Claimants have not explained how this right was

72,

harmed by the Supreme Court decision.?”? That decision did not prevent the sale,

marketing or distribution of such products.”

The Respondent dismisses the theories put forward by the Claimants to show a
connection, arguing that they do not establish an “immediate” cause and effect between
Panama’s actions and the effects on the investment.?”+ According to Panama, for
BSAM’s alleged “investment” to have been affected directly by the Supreme Court
decision, that decision would need to have dealt with BSAM’s right to put the
Panamanian FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks on tires, which the decision

does not do.?’>

The question, Panama contends, is not a causation issue, but rather,
whether the rights subject of the Supreme Court decision are the same rights alleged to

constitute BSAM’s investment, and it is clear that they are not the same.2/°

For Panama, the connection that the Claimants seek to draw — characterized as an
allegation that the Supreme Court decision affected some third-party rights, and that
BSAM and its subsidiaries derived other rights from those third parties — is plainly

“indirect” and therefore outside the scope of ICSID jurisdiction.?””

b. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants ask the Tribunal to dismiss this objection.?”*

According to their last
submission, the objection should be dismissed for either of the following alternative
reasons: (i) it is not a matter of competence; (ii) it is intertwined with the merits, and all
the necessary evidence is not before the Tribunal such that the Respondent has not
discharged its burden of proof; or (iii) if the objection is a matter of competence and the
Tribunal has sufficient evidence before it to decide it safely, then it should conclude that

BSAM’s dispute arises directly out of its investment, i.e. its trademark rights.”

The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s objection is misconceived,”*°

explaining
that BSAM does not claim for the penalty that the Supreme Court ordered BSJ and BSLS
to pay, and BSLS paid. Rather, the Claimants argue, BSAM claims because its
intellectual property rights under the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE Trademark
Licenses have been “diluted” as a consequence of the Supreme Court decision,”*! and the
decision “has made it much more costly for BSAM to maintain its investment in Panama

and other countries in the region.”***

283,

In this connection, the Claimants explain that the Supreme Court decision (i) may be
followed in other countries, leading to reduction of trademark protections, sales and
market share; (ii) may “establish a precedent” that it is “likely” to be followed within and
outside of Panama; and (iii) made more similar and confusingly similar trademark

applications “likely.”

The Claimants explain that (i) because it is BSAM and its subsidiaries who license the
FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks, they are who “ultimately stand to
substantially lose if the trademarks that are at the center of their investment are
devalued’;?** and (ii) the amount of supplies that Bandag of Panama S.A. acquires from
Bridgestone has decreased because the sales of retreads have decreased “due in part” to
the weaker intellectual property protection in Panama resulting from the Supreme Court

decision.”

Recalling that BSAM’s investment is the intellectual property rights in the FIRESTONE
and BRIDGESTONE Trademark Licenses, and that “only BSAM” uses the trademarks in
Panama, the Claimants submit that the majority of the loss is incurred by BSAM
“because the value of its assets is directly contingent on the value of the trademarks to
which those assets relate.”?*° If it is accepted that BSLS (and BSJ) suffered loss in
royalties resulting from the Supreme Court decision, the Claimants argue, “it is obvious”
that BSAM also suffered loss because those royalties depend on sales, manufacturing and

use of the trademark.”

The Claimants submit that they have shown an “immediate ‘cause and effect’” between
the Panama’s actions and the effect on BSAM’s investment,?** even though in this

preliminary expedited phase they “cannot be expected to provide detailed evidence of the

there was a connecting factor in that payment of the damages imposed by the Supreme Court decision directly

loss that BSAM has suffered as a result.”?®° In connection with their position on the
evidentiary standard, the Claimants submit that their factual allegations are sufficient for
purposes of this objection, given that the “factual inquiry as to causation” necessary to
determine if those allegations are proven is not appropriate in this expedited phase.?°°
They add that, in this phase the Claimants are not required to provide evidence of the loss
suffered,”*! and that the Tribunal’s approach should be to “assume that the Claimants
have suffered such loss as set out in paragraphs 54 to 58 of the Request, and consider the

Respondent's objection in that light.””””

The Claimants further contend that the Respondent conceded during the Hearing that for
purposes of this objection it would assume that the causation arguments are correct.
Accordingly, the Claimants argue, it is to be assumed also that BSAM has a dispute and
the only remaining question is “whether the dispute arises directly out of the

9293

investment. Because BSAM’s investment is “contingent on BSLS’s and BJS’s

trademarks, it is also affected by the Supreme Court decision, and consequently its loss

does arise directly out of its investment.”?°+

The Claimants reject the contention that the dispute is necessarily indirect as BSAM’s
investment is contingent on BSLS’s and BSJ’s trademarks in Panama. In their view, this
conflates two points: while BSAM’s investment can only exist because of those
trademarks, BSAM’s dispute arises directly out of its own investment as BSAM’s assets

suffered loss because of the Supreme Court decision.”°°

Finally, the Claimants observe that the requirements in Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention are not to be interpreted narrowly, and the measure does not have to be

directed specifically towards BSAM’s investment.?°° All the Claimants are required to

do at this stage is to establish a prima facie case that BSAM’s investment has been

adversely affected by the Supreme Court decision, which they argue has been done.??”

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The first issue that the Tribunal has to resolve that arises under this Objection is whether
it is one that goes to competence. The Claimants submit that it does not. The Tribunal is
in no doubt that it does, and that the burden of proving that BSAM has a dispute arising
directly out of an investment falls on BSAM. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention lays
down two requirements in relation to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The first is that there
must be an investment. That is a requirement of fact. Its ultimate resolution depends not
on what the Claimants allege but on the factual position as determined by the Tribunal on
the evidence. The second requirement is that the dispute must arise directly out of the
investment. Once the Tribunal has identified the investment no further findings of fact
are required in order to determine whether or not the dispute arises directly out of it. The
Tribunal has to identify the relevant dispute but not resolve it. It then has to consider the

nexus of that dispute with BSAM’s investment.

There appears to have been little discussion in previous cases as to the test to be applied
when deciding whether a dispute arises directly out of an investment. Panama has
referred the Tribunal to an unofficial English translation of a single paragraph from the

decision in Metalpar:?*

“95. In the opinion of the Tribunal, for the legal dispute to arise
‘directly’ out of the investment there must be an immediate ‘cause-
and-effect’ relationship between the actions of the host State and
the effects of such actions on the protected investments; one must
be able to establish firsthand a causal link between the investment
and the actions of the host State that produce the harm. This does
not mean, however, that the measures taken by the State must be
aimed specifically against the investment. It is sufficient that an
immediate (as opposed to a remote) link can be established
between the harm to the investment and the actions that cause it.”

This seems to the Tribunal a sound and sensible test and it is happy to adopt it.

Panama does not challenge BSLS’s contention that it has a dispute with Panama that
arises directly out of its investment in Panama. Its investment is the FIRESTONE
trademark registered in Panama. The dispute in BSLS’s case is as to whether the
judgment of the Panama Supreme Court has wrongfully inflicted a penalty on BSLS for
taking lawful and reasonable steps to protect that investment. The penalty is the damages
and costs awarded by the Supreme Court against BSLS and BSJ in the total sum of
US$5,431,000. BSLS seeks to recover that sum. The nexus between the action that is
alleged to have caused harm to the investment and the alleged harm could hardly be

closer.

Panama contrasts the position of BSLS with that of BSAM. BSAM was not a party to the
proceedings that resulted in the judgment of the Supreme Court and had no award of
damages or costs made against it. BSAM had not been party to the prior challenge to the
registration by Muresa of the RIVERSTONE trademark that was the subject matter of the

proceedings in the Supreme Court.

That contrast would be valid if BSLS’s only claim was in respect of the judgment debt,
but that is not the case. BSAM has made it plain that it makes no claim in relation to the
judgment debt. That debt, however, is only part of the total of at least US$16 million that
BSLS and BSAM claim jointly. So far as BSAM is concerned, the issue is whether the
dispute in relation to its claim arises directly from its investment, and the same issue
arises in respect of the balance of BSLS’s claim, although no specific challenge has been

made to that at this stage.

It seems to the Tribunal that the two claims must stand or fall together. Each claims in
respect of its interest in the FIRESTONE trademark, BSLS as the owner and BSAM as
the licensee. Each was benefitting from the exploitation of the trademark. BSLS’s
interest in the trademark was restricted to the royalties that it was to receive from BSAM
for the use of the trademark. BSAM’s interest was in the fruits of the exploitation of the
trademark. BSAM had relied upon BSLS to protect the trademark and thus to protect
BSAM’s interest in the trademark. As Ms. Williams explained, BSAM as licensee could

77

243.

244.

245.

246.

have joined with BSLS in opposing the registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark.
Had it done so, it would no doubt also have been joined as a defendant in the proceedings

that resulted in the Supreme Court’s judgment.

The same reasoning applies in relation to the shared interests in the BRIDGESTONE
trademark of BSJ and BSAM, albeit that BSJ, being a Japanese company, was not in a
position to join in the present proceedings. The joinder of BSJ in the proceedings against
Muresa was, in large measure, for the purpose of protecting BSAM’s investment in

relation to the BRIDGESTONE Trademark License.

What is the nature of the damage alleged by BSLS and BSAM to have been caused to
their respective investments? The Tribunal has not found it easy to formulate this from
their pleadings. It falls into two parts; damage sustained in Panama and damage

sustained outside Panama.

The Tribunal’s understanding of that part of the Claimants’ case that relates to damage
sustained in Panama is as follows. Any owner of a trademark, or a license to use a
trademark, in Panama will be concerned, as a result of the precedent set by the Supreme
Court, that steps reasonably taken to enforce it may result in a heavy liability in damages.
The chilling effect of this makes the protection afforded by or in respect of a trademark in
Panama more expensive to enforce, and the trademark less attractive and less valuable in
consequence. This in its turn is likely to encourage the registration and use in Panama of
trademarks that are confusingly similar to, inter alia, the FIRESTONE and
BRIDGESTONE trademarks, thereby further diminishing the goodwill attaching to those

brands.

Putting the Claimants’ case at its simplest it is that an aberrant decision of the Supreme
Court to award damages against BSJ and BSLS, for taking action designed to protect
their investments and those of BSAM, has caused damage to the value of those
investments. Panama has not accepted that the judgment of the Supreme Court has had
the alleged effect, but for the purposes of this Objection it is enough that this is the
subject of the dispute. In the Tribunal’s view that dispute arises directly out of the

investments of BSLS and BSAM.

What of the damage alleged to have been caused outside Panama? Here Objection No. 2
covers the same territory as Objection No. 5, which is made in respect of both Claimants,
but on different grounds. The Tribunal considers both grounds when dealing with
Objection No. 5. For the reasons there given, it finds that there is no “immediate cause-
and-effect relationship” between the judgment given by the Supreme Court and the
alleged effects outside Panama. On the contrary, the relationship is speculative and
remote. For this reason, the Tribunal finds that the claims made by BSAM in relation to

losses caused outside Panama fall outside its jurisdiction.

For the reasons given, the Tribunal dismisses Objection No. 2 insofar as it relates to
BSAM’s disputed claim to have suffered damage within Panama but allows the Objection

in relation to BSAM’s disputed claim to have suffered damage outside Panama.

OBJECTIONS RELATING TO BSLS

Third Objection: BSLS Is Not Entitled to the Benefits of Chapter 10 of the TPA
(1) The Parties’ Positions

a. The Respondent’s Position

Relying on Article 10.12.2 of the TPA (denial of benefits provision), the Respondent
argues that BSLS is not entitled to bring any claim under Chapter 10 of the TPA, as

Panama denies the benefits of Chapter 10 to it.?”

For Panama, the exercise of the denial of benefits provision “has the effect of depriving
the Tribunal of jurisdiction.”*®° The Respondent explains that Chapter 10 of the TPA
allows a TPA Party to deny an investor and its investments the benefits of both the
substantive and the dispute settlement provisions of Chapter 10 in certain

circumstances,**! which are met in this case.

253.

(i) | The Substantive Requirements

Panama contends that the three substantive requirements for the exercise of the denial of
benefits provision in Article 10.12.2 of the TPA are met here, because BSLS: (i) is an
“enterprise” of the other TPA Party (the United States); (ii) is wholly owned by BSJ (a
Japanese corporation); and (iii) does not have any “discernible operations” or “business
activities” at all in the territory of the United States, let alone “substantial business

activities.”*°?. The Respondent notes that points (i) and (ii) are uncontested.*°

With regard to the third aspect, Panama argues that there is no “bright line” standard for
determining “substantial business activities” in a country, and that any number of factors
may be relevant to the analysis, with the goal being to determine whether BSLS has
“physical presence” in the United States, or if it is “more akin to a shell company with no
geographical location for its nominal, passive, limited and insubstantial activities.”**
The Respondent has further explained that among the range of factors considered by
previous tribunals are: (i) existence of a physical office; (ii) number of employees
working at the place of business; (iii) whether address, phone and fax are offered to third
parties; (iv) whether the parent company is the source of capital; (v) location of annual

meetings of board or shareholders; and (vi) existence of records of annual meetings.*”>

Panama rejects the contention that the magnitude of the activities is not important, and
instead argues that the conclusion in Pac Rim that the level of activities is important is
consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word “substantial.”*°° The Respondent has

further argued that “‘substantial’ means ‘sizeable,’ and ‘business’ involves offering

goods or services to unrelated parties.”**’ And the analysis of whether the activities are

substantial is to be done “in context”, according to Panama.*°8 Further, for Panama,

States, Panama averred in its Expedited Objections that:

e There is no indication that BSLS has any business activities in the United States in
multiple databases consulted (such as, corporate directories, domestic and
international litigation reporters, business news sources, trade journals and trademark
registration databases).*!*

e As far as Panama can discern, BSLS is “precisely the type of ‘shell company”
excluded from protection under the TPA as: (i) BSLS does not appear to own any
assets in the United States; (ii) has issued 1,000 shares with a par value of zero; (iii)
does not appear in public documents describing the Bridgestone family corporate
structure; (iv) was not mentioned in BSJ’s 2015 Annual Reports; and (v) has
virtually no presence in public databases.*!°

e The document provided to show that BSLS had taken all the necessary actions to
authorize the Request for Arbitration in this case was apparently signed and
notarized in Japan.*!©

e BSLS’s business address in the United States is the same used by BSAM and other
Bridgestone entities, and it is not clear whether BSLS has any employees of its own
that work at this address>!

The Respondent has further observed that the evidence provided by the Claimants to
support business activities post-dates the Request for Arbitration, and that in any event,

that evidence further supports Panama’s case.*!* According to Panama:

Incorporation alone does not demonstrate any business activities, especially when the
Claimants have admitted that all work associated with maintaining BSLS’s corporate
status is conducted by external counsel and corporate service firms.*!?

The business address in Nashville provided as BSLS’s official address is the
headquarters of BSAM, which conducts all management matters for BSLS; BSLS
does not have separate phone or suite; and BSLS does not appear to lease separate
office space.*?°

BSLS does not have any full-time employees.*”!
BSLS has no letterhead, no product and no public visibility. *77

BSLS’s board is formed by three Japanese citizens; it does not meet in the United
States; it apparently holds conference calls in lieu of meetings; it does not keep
minutes; and its resolutions are prepared by outside counsel.*”> Further, only one
member is allegedly based in Nashville, and he states in a social network profile that
he is employed by BSAM; BSLS’s officers likewise appear to be BSAM’s
employees to whom BSLS’s has contracted out work; and one of those officers
concedes that he only spends 7-10% of his time working on BSLS’s matters.***4

The evidence provided by the Claimants regarding BSLS’s financial activities is
problematic because: it gives no insight about the state of affairs at the time of the
Request for Arbitration; the financial statements appear as internal spreadsheets and
do not indicate who prepared them and for what purpose; the tax documents
provided with the Response on Expedited Objections only attest that a return was
filed, but do not show an actual tax return, and in any event paying taxes in the State
of incorporation does not reveal the existence of substantial business activities;*?>

and the Claimants have made certain statements about BSLS’s financial activities
that are misleading.*”°

The evidence shows that all of the activities associated with management of the
FIRESTONE trademark are conducted by external entities, not by BSLS itself; and
BSLS is subject to BSJ’s supervision in this aspect.*”” And it is BSAM (not BSLS)
who manages the contractors performing the work.”

The licensing agreements provided in the Response on Expedited Objections range
from 2001 to 2017, and thus “most” do not assist in establishing business activities
on the relevant date; many are not revenue generating; and in any event, the mere
existence of license agreements between BSLS and third parties alone is no evidence
of substantial business activities.>”°

The “activities” that BSLS claims to conduct (i.e. “licensing” and “management” of
non-US trademarks) “essentially take place in the ether’, need not be done from a
certain location and appear not to be done from any particular location.**”

What BSLS does is “sign pre-negotiated contracts, collect royalty payments and
enter into retainer agreements with outside counsel”, which to the extent it can be
considered an “activity”, is neither “substantial” nor “business” activity in the
territory of the United States.**!

Passive income is not an “activity”, and the passive nature of BSLS’s income is
highlighted by its heavy-dependence on intra-company loans.***

The tax filings, bank statements, board resolutions, retainer agreements, and law firm
invoices that BSLS has been able to “scrounge up” simply show that BSLS is doing
the “bare minimum” required of a U.S. incorporated company.***

e BSLS is only a passive holder of the FIRESTONE trademark outside of the United
States, used by the Japanese parent for trademark licensing outside of the United
States. It exists on paper, but the Claimants cannot point to substantial business
activities.*5

(ii) The Procedural Requirements

The Respondent further contends that, under Article 10.12.2 of the TPA, read in
conjunction with Article 18.3.1 of the TPA, the only procedural requirement for the
exercise of the denial of benefits is for the denying TPA Party to provide notice to the
other TPA Party “to the maximum extent possible” °°

United States dated 22 May 2017.**7 The Respondent argues that under the TPA, the

which was done by letter to the

State is not required to give advance notice to the claimant, nor it is required to carry out

the denial of benefits before the arbitration proceeding begins.***

Panama rejects the contention that it was required to give notice to the United States “as

9339

promptly as it could have done” or “as soon as possible. It argues that: (i) the

expression “to the maximum extent possible” “plainly means that notice should be made
before invoking the denial of benefits clause, unless it is not possible to do so”;**° (ii) as
the TPA establishes no deadline for invoking the denial of benefits clause, it is improper
to impose the deadlines suggested by the Claimants — i.e., notice of intent or registration
of the request for arbitration; and (iii) the only time limit for invoking the denial of

benefits provision is that in Arbitration Rule 41 pursuant to which objections to

competence shall be made no later than the expiry of the time limit fixed for the counter-

memorial.*"!

Panama further dismisses the Claimants’ allegation that timing of the notice deprived the
United States from making a ‘“non-disputing Party’ submission or to engage in
consultations under Article 20.4, alleging that: (i) this is not an argument for the
Claimants to make, but rather for the United States; (ii) the Claimants have not been
prejudiced, and do not explain how consultations would work in their favour; and (iii) in
any event, the timetable has allowed for both consultations and “non-disputing Party”

submissions. *47

(iii) Burden and Standard of Proof

Panama argues that the burden of proving a fact rests with the party asserting that fact,
and accepts that “[i]n general [...] Panama would bear the burden of proving its positive

objections (such as this one).”*?

However, the Respondent argues, in this specific
situation, as Panama is required to prove a negative (i.e. that BSLS has no substantial
business activities), the burden shifted back to the Claimants once the Respondent

submitted “cogent evidence” that the denial of benefits provision applies, as it did.*4*

The Respondent denies that the appropriate standard is for the Tribunal to accept the
Claimants’ factual assertions in the Request for Arbitration, arguing that this is not
appropriate for factual issues on which the Tribunal’s jurisdiction depends.*4> Relying on
Pac Rim, Panama contends that it is impermissible for the Tribunal to base its jurisdiction

on assumed facts.*4°

b. The Claimants’ Position

262. The Claimants ask the Tribunal to dismiss this objection.*4’ In their last submission, they
argue that the objection should be dismissed because BSLS has amply shown that it has

“substantial business activities” in the United States.*4*

(i) The Notice Requirement

263. The Claimants argue that, to exercise the provision in Article 10.12 of the TPA, Panama
was required to provide adequate and timely notice to the United States of its intent to
deny benefits to BSLS, as required by Article 18.3 of the TPA, and to engage in
consultations with the United States as required by Article 20.4 of the TPA,*? both of

which it failed to do.*°°

264. According to the Claimants, although Panama was required to give its notice to the
United States “to the maximum extent possible”, that is, “to do everything in its power to
provide advance notice”, it failed to give notice to the United States, “as promptly as it
could have done.”*>'! The Claimants point out that the notice was given on 22 May 2017,
even though the Respondent knew about BSLS’s involvement in this dispute at least
since the notice of intent of arbitration of 30 September 2015, or even if it wanted to wait
until there was a request for arbitration, it could have sent the notice once the Request for

Arbitration was registered on 28 October 2016.7°

notice was given only one week before the filing of the Expedited Objections and the

Respondent has elected to use an expedited procedure.***

(ii) The Evidentiary Standard

In their Response on Expedited Objections, the Claimants argued that (i) although limited
by reason of the Claimants having learned of this objection only upon receipt of the
Expedited Objections, “there are sufficient facts” in the Request for Arbitration and their
supplementary 25 October 2016 letter to allow the Tribunal to dismiss this objection; (ii)
the Tribunal is required to assume these facts as true, and the Respondent is not entitled
to introduce new facts for determination by the Tribunal; (iii) as the Tribunal is not
permitted to consider the facts in dispute asserted by the Respondent pursuant to the
regime in Article 10.20.5 of the TPA, if the Tribunal does not consider that the facts put
forward by the Claimants with the Request and October letter allow it to dispose of the
objection, the Tribunal “is not able” to determine the objection at this stage, because to
do so it would need to consider additional factual assertions made by the Respondent,
which is not allowed. However, in light of the Respondent’s position on the issue of the
evidentiary standard under Article 10.20.5, the Claimants provided further evidence
showing that BSLS has substantial business activities in the United States,**4 discussed

infra, at paragraph 279.

In the Rejoinder on Expedited Objections, the Claimants invited the Tribunal to dismiss
the objection “outright” on the basis that the Respondent has not put forward “cogent
evidence” that the denial of benefits provision applied.**° They went on to argue, that if
the Tribunal decided not to take that approach, it had three alternative courses to dismiss

the objection:**°

e First, to take as true the Claimants’ pleaded facts as to BSLS’s business activities in
the Request for Arbitration and October 2016 letter and refuse to consider the
disputed facts alleged by the Respondent.

e Second, to consider the evidence adduced by both sides mindful of the limited
opportunity the Claimants have had to adduce evidence given the expedited nature of
the proceeding, and dismiss the objection as not being capable of being resolved in
an expedited basis.

e Third, to review the evidence adduced so far, and conclude that the Claimants have
provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate BSLS’s substantial business activities.
In connection with the second alternative, the Rejoinder on Expedited Objections
indicated that had the Claimants had more time, they would have been able to provide
more evidence. Thus, the Claimants added, if the Tribunal was minded to consider the
evidence, and concluded that it was not sufficient to establish that BSLS has substantial
business activities in the United States, it could not “thereby safely conclude that BSLS
fails to satisfy that standard.”*>’ They also argued that if the Tribunal not minded to
dismiss this objection on the ground that the Respondent has failed to put forward
sufficient evidence to make the objection, the Tribunal should dismiss it “on the basis of
the evidence, while bearing in mind that the Claimants have not had a full opportunity to
put forward all the evidence that they would like to [...] due to the compressed timetable

required by the Respondent’s expedited process.”*°*

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the Post-Hearing Brief the Claimants acknowledge that

“it was agreed that the Tribunal would decide the denial of benefits objection.”*°

(iii) Substantial Business Activities

The Claimants do no dispute that BSLS is an entity incorporated in Delaware, and that it
is wholly-owned by BSJ, a Japanese incorporated entity.*°° However, they submit that
this alone is not sufficient to allow the denial of benefits, as Panama cannot prove that

BSLS lacks substantial business activities in the United States.*°!

The Claimants agree that there is no “bright line standard” for determining substantial

business activities, but:

Submit that the decision in Pac Rim serves as a “useful benchmark’, in that: first, it
found that the claimant was not a “traditional holding company actively holding
shares in subsidiaries” but “more akin to a shell company with no geographical
location for its nominal, passive, limited and insubstantial activities”; and second,
referred to evidence showing that the claimant (i) did not have employees, (ii) did
not lease office space, (iii) only held assets, (iv) did not have a bank account, (v) did
not have a board of directors.*°

Refer to the decision AMTO (i) holding that substantial means “of substance and not
merely of form”, it “does not mean ‘large”” and “the materiality not the magnitude
[...] is the decisive question”, and (ii) concluding that the requirement was met
because the claimant conducted activities from premises in the relevant country,
employed a “a small but permanent staff’, paid taxes, held a bank account and
rented office space in that country.**

Further, while not disputing the contention that “substantial” means “of ample or
considerable amount or size, or sizeable”, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has
not contributed to clarifying with authority what this means in relation to an entity.°
The Claimants submit that annual revenue exceeding US$ 5 million (as BSLS’s) is

substantial.*°

The Claimants agree that the activities of the wider Bridgestone Group cannot be
attributed to BSLS in the analysis of its activities for purposes of this objection, but
dispute the notion that this should then lead to disregarding the activities of external
contractors (for example, legal counsel), when these services are engaged and paid by

BSLS.* The Claimants further clarify that they are not asking the Tribunal to attribute

activities of other group companies to BSLS, but simply to understand the significant role

of BSLS in the corporate structure.*°”

According to the Claimants, the U.S. Second Submission makes clear that the

“substantial business activities” threshold is not high, when it observes that “shell
companies” could be subject to the denial, but not “firms that maintain their central
administration or principal place of business in the territory of, or have a real and

continuous link with, the country where they are established.”*®

The Claimants refute Panama’s allegation at the Hearing that the test for “substantial” is
necessarily subjective, arguing that it is unsupported by authority and it contradicts
Panama’s other argument that the activities of other companies of the group cannot be

taken into account.*°

The Claimants further reject the Respondent’s contention at the Hearing that the term
“business” activities refers to activities linked to buying or selling goods or services, and
to dealing with third parties (rather than intra-group activities).*”° | According to the
Claimants, that is contrary to the plain English meaning of the words, and in fact, the
word “activities” in the term “business activities” broadens the scope, as it refers to
“activities connected with business.” Even if not all of BSLS’s activities involve buying
or selling goods or services to third parties, the Claimants argue, they are certainly
connected with that business as they enable other companies to sell goods to third
parties.*”! And in any event, even if these narrow tests were accepted (quod non), BSLS

meets them as explained further infra paragraph 280.

Arguing that Panama has the burden of establishing that BSLS has no substantial
business activities in the United States, the Claimants deny that the standard is whether

BSLS shows in the selected databases searched by the Respondent, or the volume of

BSLS’s activities compared to BSAM’s.*”? According to the Claimants, the Respondent

has failed to demonstrate that BSLS lacks substantial business activities.>”°

Referring to the first alternative course of action for the Tribunal discussed supra,
paragraph 267, in the Response on Expedited Objections, the Claimants submit that the
following facts regarding BSLS’s business activities in the United States were asserted in

the Request for Arbitration and letter of October 2016, and should be assumed as true:

e BSLS is a U.S. incorporated company, and the incorporation documents show that it
has a board of directors, it has been duly constituted under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and has a physical location in the United States.*”*

e The FIRESTONE Trademark License between BSLS and BSAM is governed by
U.S. law, and thus it demonstrates that that BSLS is engaged in business activities in
the United States, as it enters into contracts such as this one, which also includes a
provision requiring that contractual notices be delivered to BSLS at its address in the
United States.*”5

And, in connection with the third alternative course of action for the Tribunal discussed

supra, paragraph 267, the Claimants assert that BSLS “easily” meets the “substantial

business activities” standard because:*”°

e It has a Board of Directors, who pass resolutions, are empowered to act for the
company, meets regularly by phone, and has a member located in the United
States.3””

e It owns intellectual property assets in foreign jurisdictions, administers these assets
from the United States applying for registrations, monitoring the markets and
protecting the trademarks.*”*

e It has officers based in the United States, who perform specific functions for BSLS,
including an Assistant Secretary.*””

liability, income, assets and liabilities of BSLS.*°! They further provide insight into
the relationship between BSJ and BSLS, including a loan for US$ 31 million in the
process of being repaid, showing that BSLS is not just an entity for BSJ to pass
funds.*°?

e There is no reason to disregard the activities on trademark management carried out
by external legal counsel retained, instructed and paid by BSLS. The situation is
similar to paying an employee to do the work.*?? And internal records of invoices
paid to external counsel since January 2015 are attached to the Rejoinder.*”*

e As distinguished from the Respondent’s allegations regarding “shell companies’,
legal counsel and accountants are not just hired to do corporate and tax filings, but
rather they do trademark work and are paid around US$600,000 a year.”

e While some of BSLS’s licensing agreements are not revenue generating, they have
material value in the way of product advertisement.°”°

e The licensing agreements generate revenue exceeding US$ 5 million for BSLS,
which is substantial.*°’ And contrary to the Respondent’s contention, this is not
passive holding of licensing agreements because: the agreements are negotiated,
signed, renegotiated, discussed with board and officers; they generate income; BSLS

pays lawyers to draft them; disputes arising out of these agreements are litigated; and
BSLS generates revenue deriving from those agreements.

e The suggested contradiction between putting forward these license agreements
(including the FIRESTONE Trademark License) as evidence of activities in the
United States, and the argument that it amounts to an investment in Panama is
confused and confusing. It fails to appreciate that the agreement grants rights to two
parties: for the licensor (BSLS) it generates revenue in the United States; and for the
licensee (BSAM) it provides intellectual property rights in various jurisdictions,
including Panama. The other agreements serve to demonstrate that BSLS as the
licensor has business activities in the United States, where BSLS is situated.*”

e Even the narrow test articulated by the Respondent at the Hearing discussed supra,
paragraph 276 is met because: (i) through license agreements BSLS grants the right
to use the FIRESTONE trademark and receives payment therefor, and (ii)
disregarding licenses to other Bridgestone companies and concluding that BSLS is
licensing to itself would ignore corporate identity and reality.*°°
Finally, according to the Claimants, BSLS has a “real and continuous link with the
country where [it is] established’, a test mentioned in the U.S. Second Submission. The
Claimants observe that BSLS’s predecessor was established in the United States in 1900,
and after the acquisition of the FIRESTONE Group by BSJ in 1998, the decision was
made to continue to run the brand from the United States, maintaining work relationships
with U.S. trademark lawyers. The trademarks were previously held by BSAM, and
BSLS purchased them from it in 2001 taking a US$31 million loan, and immediately

licensed them back.*°!

(2) The U.S. Submissions

The United States observes that Article 10.12.2 of the TPA allows the TPA Parties to
deny the benefits of Chapter 10 under certain circumstances specified in that provision.
It describes the two substantial requirements as follows: that the enterprise (i) must have

no substantial business activities in the territory of the non-denying TPA Party; and (ii)

must be owned or controlled by persons of a non-TPA Party or of the denying TPA

Party.

With regard to the term “substantial business activities”, the United States explains that
although its long practice is to omit a precise definition so that the existence of such
activities is “evaluated on case-by-case basis”, for example the United States has
indicated in its Statement of Administrative Action on the NAFTA that “shell companies
could be denied benefits but not, for example, firms that maintain their central
administration or principal place of business in the territory of, or have a real and

continuous link with, the country where they are established.”*

The United States further submits that Article 10.12.2 does not impose a timing
requirement for invoking the provision, nor does it preclude its invocation “at any
appropriate time, including as part of jurisdictional objection (expedited or otherwise)

after a claim has been submitted to arbitration [...].”4°*

Finally, referring to Article 20.4.1 of the TPA, the United States notes that when a TPA
Party seeks to deny the benefits of Chapter 10, it may but it is not required to request
consultations, which are discretionary. According to the United States, the TPA provides
no basis to draw any inferences from a TPA Party’s decision not to engage in

consultations.*°°

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 10.12 of the TPA, under the heading “Denial of Benefits”, in so far as material

provides:

“2. [...] a [TPA] Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an
investor of the other [TPA] Party that is an enterprise of such other
[TPA] Party and to investments of that investor if the enterprise
has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other

290.

[TPA] Party, and persons of a non-[TPA] Party, or of the denying

[TPA] Party, own or control the enterprise.”4°°
Panama has invoked this provision and purported to deny the benefits to BSLS. At one
time BSLS contended that Panama had failed to comply with temporal obligations that
were a condition precedent to the denial of benefits, but that challenge has not been
pursued, wisely in the view of the Tribunal. It is common ground that BSAM is owned
by a “person of a non-Party”, namely BSJ. The only issue that arises in relation to this
Objection is whether BSLS has “no substantial business activities in the territory of (the

United States].”

Two initial issues arise in relation to this Objection. The first is whether or not it is an
objection that goes to competence. Panama submits that it is; the Claimants submit that it
is not. The Tribunal is satisfied that it is. This is because one of the benefits of Chapter
10 is the right to arbitrate. That right is subject to the condition subsequent that it is not

removed by a valid denial of benefits.

The other preliminary issue is which Party to this proceeding bears the burden of proof.
The Tribunal considers that the overall burden is on Panama as the Party asserting an
entitlement to deny benefits. As, however, Panama has to prove a negative in relation to
matters that fall essentially within the knowledge of the Claimants, the evidential burden
is readily shifted. In this case, as the Tribunal anticipated, the burden of proof is
immaterial as there is ample material to enable the Tribunal to reach its decision. That

decision is final and has to be reached on the evidence.
In a helpful Supplemental Written Submission the United States notes:

“This treaty right is consistent with a long-standing U.S. policy to
include a denial of benefits provision in investment agreements to
safeguard against the potential problem of ‘free rider’ investors,
i.e., third party entities that may only as a matter of formality be
entitled to the benefits of a particular agreement. While it has long
been U.S. practice to omit a precise definition of the term
‘substantial business activities’ in order that the existence of such
activities may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the United

States has indicated in, for example, its Statement of

Administrative Action on the NAFTA that ‘shell companies could

be denied benefits but not, for example, firms that maintain their

central administration or principal place of business in the territory

of, or have a real and continuous link with, the country where they

are established.””4°”
The Tribunal is in no doubt that when the TPA was agreed the object and purpose of
including a denial of benefits provision, as explained in this Submission, was notorious
and, thus, in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention the Tribunal can

properly have regard to this.

The facts that follow are derived from the evidence of Mr. Kingsbury, who gave two

witness statements and was tendered for cross-examination at the Hearing.

BSLS was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of BSJ under the laws of the State
of Delaware on 10 September 2001. Its registered address is the same as that of BAM
in Nashville Tennessee.*°* BSAM provides corporate services for the Bridgestone Group
from that address. It has not been suggested that BSAM does not perform substantial
business activities in the U.S. Some of those activities consist of providing services for
BSLS. Thus, for instance, Mr. Kingsbury himself, while employed by BSAM, provided
intellectual property related legal services to BSLS under a support services agreement
between the two companies for about 5 years prior to November 2014, when he became
Assistant Secretary for BSLS in addition to his primary role as Chief Counsel for
Intellectual Property for BSAM.* Mr. Kingsbury now spends 7% to 10% of his time
working for BSLS.*!°

The incorporation of BSLS formed part of the reorganization of that part of the group's
activities that related to FIRESTONE tires — tires sold bearing the FIRESTONE mark.
This reflects the fact that when BSJ took over the Firestone Group the latter appears to

have continued, at least to some extent, to be managed separately from the business

relating to BRIDGESTONE tires, with corporate services being provided by companies

based in the United States.

BSLS’s primary role was concerned with the FIRESTONE trademarks.*!! Thus, after the
company had been incorporated, all the FIRESTONE trademarks were assigned to BSLS,
which received a loan from BSJ of US$ 31 million.“!? The Tribunal was informed by
counsel that this was used to pay for the trademarks and this would seem to be the
obvious inference as there was no evidence of any other activity carried on by BSLS that
would explain the need for such a large sum. BSLS then licensed the use of the

trademarks to BSAM, as already described.

Under the licenses BSLS is entitled to royalties. These are paid into BSLS’ bank account
with JP Morgan Chase Bank in San Antonio, Texas. Between 2014 and 2016 these
generated over US$ 18 million.*!3 Taxes were paid on these, with the filings being
managed internally at Nashville.*!* After taxes and expenses BSLS generated profits of

US$2,834,924, some of which was spent on brand enhancement initiatives.4!5

Between 2010 and 2013 Mr. Kingsbury spent 20% of his time working for BSLS.*!° His
work included helping to administer trademark registrations, trademark renewals and
serving as the liaison between BSLS and service providers retained by BSLS,*!” for most
of the work of BSLS was contracted out to professionals working within the United

States.

An important part of BSLS’s work consisted of protecting the FIRESTONE trademark
from infringement and confusingly similar marks in foreign jurisdictions — as evidenced
by this case. Before the reorganization in 2001, the FIRESTONE international trademark

portfolio was owned by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and was managed by a

New York law firm that specialized in international property work, called Ladas &
Parry.*!® BSLS continued to employ this firm to manage the protection of the

FIRESTONE trademark in foreign jurisdictions.*!?

The supervision of this work was done at Akron, Ohio, between 2010 up to 2013 by Mr.
Kingsbury and after 2013 by an intellectual property attorney named Mallory Smith,
hired from the Law Firm Emerson Thompson Becket, who works three days a week for

BSLS.*”°

Apart from licensing the use of the FIRESTONE trademark on tires, BSLS conducted
quite a significant business licensing the use of the trademark on games, toys and other
similar merchandise.*?!__Where royalties were payable, and sometimes none were
imposed, the amounts involved were not great. The interest in this business was the
publicity that it gave to the FIRESTONE brand. But quite a lot of activity was involved
and the Tribunal does not accept a submission made by Panama that business activities

will not be substantial unless they are money-making.

Panama submitted in its Post Hearing Brief*?? that much of this evidence demonstrated
that BSLS had no real presence in the United States. It had no offices, no full-time
employees, no letterhead, no product, no public visibility and three Japanese directors,
only one of whom lived in the United States and which met by internet. It was serviced
by employees of BSAM. Its activities were all farmed out to contractors, some inside the
United States and some outside it. Most activities could have been carried out anywhere.
“The only reason why a U.S.-incorporated entity sits at the centre of the matrix (between
Bridgestone Corporation and all of these contractors) is because that is how things

worked when Bridgestone Corporation took over Firestone.”*>

The Tribunal agrees with that last comment, which in its view is the nail in the coffin of
Objection No. 3. As the United States said at the end of the U.S. Second Written
Submission, the TPA’s benefits should not be denied to “firms that [...] have a real and
continuous link with, the country where they are established.”** Whether “substantial
activities’ mean “activities of substance” or “significant activities”, and different
tribunals have expressed different views on this question, BSLS carried out such
activities in the United States. They had been a significant part of the business activities
of the American Firestone Group, with its headquarters in the United States, before it was
taken over by BSJ and continued to be after the takeover. Some of the activities were
carried out with assistance from the U.S. based sister company BSAM. The nature of
many of the activities was such that they were contracted out to specialist lawyers, as
they had been before BSLS existed, but this was mostly done within the United States. It
is true that BSLS’s activities were overseen by its Japanese parent, and no doubt
decisions of principle were taken in Japan. But that is a natural feature of the relationship
between a parent company and its subsidiary. It is not incompatible with the subsidiary
carrying on substantial business activities. The Tribunal is satisfied that BSLS has and
had substantial business activities within the United States and dismisses Objection No.

Fourth Objection: BSLS’s Claims Amount to an Abuse of Process
(1) The Parties’ Positions

a. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over BSLS’s claims because
“[BSLS] committed an abuse of process: it attempted to manipulate the nationality of a
claim after the dispute had already materialized”, to create a jurisdictional basis when

none existed.*”> For the Respondent, the abuse occurred when BSLS paid the damages

4U.S. Second Sub., { 2.
+25 Resp. Exp. Obj. M42, 43.

304.

305.

306.

awarded by the Supreme Court — which the Claimants argue occurred on 19 August 2016

#6_ after the present dispute had already arisen.*?”

In the Reply on Expedited Objections, the Respondent submits in slightly different terms
that if the Tribunal finds that “the Bridgestone group of companies took steps after the
present dispute was foreseeable to manufacture jurisdiction [...] the claims by [BSLS]
automatically would constitute an abuse of process, and would need to be dismissed.”*8
This bars BSLS’s claims even if the technical standards for jurisdiction under the TPA

are met.*”°

Discussing the standard for an abuse of process objection at the Hearing, the Respondent
further explained relying on Phillip Morris v. Australia, that: (i) the test for this objection
is an objective one, and accordingly, there is no requirement to show bad faith, nor does
the Tribunal need to find the motive of the abusing party; and (ii) in this case the abuse
“is seen in the fact that an investor whose claim is not protected by an investment treaty
takes action in such a fashion as to ensure that its claim falls within the scope of

protection of a treaty in view of a specific foreseeable or, in this case, actual dispute.”**°

To support its allegation of abuse, the Respondent points out that it is uncontested that the
dispute arose some time in 2015.**! It also notes that both BSLS and BSJ had been held
jointly and severally liable by the Supreme Court in May 2014.47? However, Panama
argues, in 2015 and most of 2016 there was not clear jurisdictional path available for the
claim because BSAM (a non-party to the domestic proceeding) had no “investment” in
Panama, BSJ did not have investment treaty protection as it is a Japanese entity, and
BSLS needed to show that it had “incurred loss or damage” in order to file a claim under

the TPA, which it could not do as the amount ordered by the Supreme Court had not been

#26 Resp. Exp. Obj., { 42 (referring to the Request for Arbitration). The Respondent has taken issue with the 19
August 2016 letter the Claimants initially presented as evidence of payment, arguing that it only indicates that BSJ
and BSLS “will proceed” to make the payment. Resp. Reply Exp. Obj., [ 86.

paid.33

Had BSJ made the payment, Panama argues, BSLS could not have styled it as
“loss or damage”, and no Bridgestone entity had an investment treaty case.**+ In fact,
Panama observes, the payment was made a year after the dispute arose, and just seven

weeks before the filing of the Request for Arbitration.**°

Relying on Article 10.16.1(a) of the TPA, Panama disputes the allegation that the
relevant date to assert BSLS’s eligibility to bring a claim is the date of the treaty breach,

and not that of the loss.*°°

Nor does the Respondent accept that the date of the loss is the date on which the Supreme
Court ordered BSLS to pay damages. Panama argues that this ignores that: (i) BSLS did
not pay the damages when they were awarded, and instead “Bridgestone” spent over two
years trying to avoid payment during which no formal enforcement action was taken by
the creditors; and (ii) as both BSLS and BSJ were jointly and severally liable, neither
entity could claim loss unless and until payment was made, and each could only recover

for the sum it paid itself.497

For Panama, even assuming arguendo that the damages
awarded constituted an incurred “Joss”, BSLS could still not establish that it and not BSJ

(the other equally liable entity) was the one who incurred that loss.**

In fact, for the Respondent, the timing of the payment alone would be sufficient to
demonstrate the abuse.**? Panama submits that under the objective standard the Tribunal
does not need to consider the reason why BSLS (and not BSJ) chose to pay.“° However,
if that is to be considered, Panama argues that the “only plausible explanation” is that

BSLS was trying to bring itself into compliance with the TPA.“

310. While questioning the evidence presented by the Claimants to establish the payment was
made on 19 August 2016, the Respondent submits that accepting that this is what
occurred shows the abuse.*4? For Panama, the payment by BSLS raises more questions
because: (i) BSLS had no discernible assets to pay the judgement, whereas BSJ did; and
(ii) by the Claimants’ own allegations, the decision to pay “through” BSLS had a

negative impact on BSLS’s finances, which could have been avoided if BSJ had paid.

311. The Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to explain why the choice to have
BSLS incur the loss was logical; and does not accept that the Claimants had “no choice’,
given that it was up to the entities jointly and severally liable (BSLS and BSJ) to decide

which one would pay and when.*#

312. Moreover, Panama argues that it is not true that BSLS did nothing to bring itself into
compliance with the TPA. In the Respondent’s account, the evidence at the Hearing
showed that in the Spring of 2016, the Bridgestone Group, advised that BSLS had no
case under the TPA if BSJ paid the damages, devised a plan to get around the
jurisdictional barriers centred on having BSLS pay. This decision, Panama argues,
was guided by what the Bridgestone Group knew about the TPA jurisdictional
requirements.*#° And “[m]aking this happen required months of advanced planning, and
a USD 6 million loan from BSAM.”*“" Therefore, while still maintaining that the test of
abuse does not require a showing of motive, the Respondent now argues that it has indeed

established a motive for the abuse.*4*

313. The Respondent also questions the allegation that BSLS paid with its own funds.
Panama argues that, the Claimants’ own witness in cross-examination, the pleadings, the

exhibits and the transcript confirm that the reality was that BSJ paid “through” BSLS,

and that it did so, deliberately, with the help of outside counsel, after the dispute arose, to

enable BSLS to assert a claim, despite considering the payment a loss for the group.*?

The Respondent accepts that when BSLS paid it was “on some level” doing what the
Supreme Court ordered it and BSJ to do. It argues, however, that the issue is when it did

it. And given the when, the Respondent argues, “an ulterior ‘why’ must be presumed.”*°

Finally, referring to the Claimants’ assertion that the significant point on timing is that
the payment was made after all local remedies were exhausted, the Respondent submits
that this does not absolve the impropriety. However, Panama argues, the point is
significant to undermine the Claimants’ case, including inter alia to: confirm that the
denial of justice claim lacked merit when asserted; undermine the argument that the loss
was automatic with the issuance of the Supreme Court decision; and cast doubt on

compliance with the mandatory sequence for submitting claim to arbitration.**!

b. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants ask the Tribunal to dismiss this objection.*°* According to their last

submission, the objection should be dismissed for either of the following alternative
reasons: (i) it is not a matter of competence; and (ii) if the objection is a matter of
competence and the Tribunal has sufficient evidence before it to decide it safely, then it

should conclude that the Respondent has failed to articulate the abuse.**

The Claimants contend that this objection is “vague”, “confused”, “illogical and
meritless.”*4 Tt ignores that BSJ and BSLS were held jointly and severally liable, and
that BSLS did not force itself to incur in loss, but rather that it was Panama’s Supreme

Court decision who did.*°5

318. Relying on Phillips Morris, the Claimants argue that an abuse of process allegation must
meet a “high bar’, and that abuse has been found when “an investor who is not protected

by an investment treaty restructures its investment in such as fashion as to fall within the

scope of protection of a treaty in view of a specific foreseeable dispute.”*°

319. For the Claimants, Panama has not explained which was the abuse committed by BSLS.
They argue that (i) it cannot be manipulation of its nationality, because BSLS has always

been a U.S. company; and (ii) it cannot be manipulation of the investment’s nationality

7

because the investment has always been Panamanian.**” Accordingly, the Claimants

understand that the allegation is that the nationality of the claim was manipulated, and

argue that this is “incoherent.”*8 ~The Claimants submit that:

e The treaty breach occurred with the Supreme Court’s decision on 28 May 2014, and
the dispute arose following that judgement.*?

e BSLS incurred the loss on the date the Supreme Court decision ordered it to pay the
damages, i.e., 28 May 2014, and thus it does not matter when the payment was
made.‘ Relying on Mobil Investments, the Claimants contend that “damages are

incurred and compensation is due when there is a firm obligation to make a payment

[

 

e Even if were correct that loss for the US$ 5.4 million ordered by the Supreme Court
only occurred when the payment was made, the Claimants also claim loss in excess
of that sum, which is a loss consequential to the Supreme Court decision, that the
Claimants began to incur on the date of the decision.*”

e Because BSLS and BSJ were held jointly and severally liable for the whole sum,
while BSJ could have paid, BSLS can hardly be charged with abuse of process for

paying a sum it was ordered by a court to pay.*? While BSJ could have paid, it is
not surprising that BSLS being the entity specifically tasked with protecting
intellectual property rights made the payment.**

e The assertion that it was illogical for BSLS to pay because it is a “shell” company
with no assets is both circular and disingenuous. It is also entirely reliant on the
success of the denial of benefits objection, which should fail.“ In fact, BSLS is an
entity with assets and substantial business activities, able to make the payment.*°
And even if the Tribunal found that BSLS has no business activities in the United
States (quod non), the fact remains that BSLS was liable for the sum.*°7

 

e It is absurd to argue that BSLS paid to put itself into a better position. Had BSLS not
discharged the liability imposed by the Supreme Court decision, it was exposed to
enforcement actions against its assets in Panama.*®* It is also absurd to suggest that
BSLS and BSJ did not need to pay and should have put themselves in contempt of
court or wait for enforcement action.*°

The Claimants explain that BSLS paid after it exhausted all possibilities to overturn the

Supreme Court judgement and had no other option; and it made that payment because it

was jointly and severally liable, and because its board considered that settling the liability

was in the best interest of the company.*”°

The argument that BSLS used the time between the Supreme Court decision and the
payment to bring itself into compliance with the TPA jurisdictional requirements is
“hopeless” given that: (i) BSLS has always been a U.S. incorporated company; (ii) it is
plainly not the case that it lacks substantial business activities; and (iii) there is no
allegation that within this time BSLS tried to increase activities to make them more

“substantial.”*”'

In response to Panama’s allegations concerning the identity of the entity that made the

payment, the Claimants: (i) provide additional proof of BSLS’s payment in the form of a

bank statement from BSLS and; (ii) argue that the suggestion that it was not BSLS who

paid, but rather BSJ “through” BSLS ignores corporate identity.*””

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Two preliminary issues arise. The first is whether this is an issue that goes to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal’s view is as follows. On the face of it, BSLS’s
claim falls within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is for an alleged loss caused by
alleged breaches of obligation under the TPA by Panama. Both the alleged breaches and
the alleged losses occurred at a time when the Claimant, BSLS, was a company
incorporated and carrying on business (as the Tribunal has just found) in the United
States. Panama’s position is that BSLS brought this position about by an abuse of
process. If that contention is made good, the response of the Tribunal should be, in its
view, not that it has no jurisdiction but that it declines to exercise that jurisdiction. The
contrary could, however be argued — see Mobil Corporation.*”* Which view is correct

has no significance on the facts of this case.

The second preliminary issue is that of burden of proof. As Panama alleges abuse on the
part of BSLS the burden is on Panama to prove the abuse. Once again, however, the

decision of the Tribunal does not turn on burden of proof.

Panama’s case can be summarised as follows. The alleged wrongs on the part of Panama
occurred when the Supreme Court gave its decision on 28 May 2014. On that date the
possibility of a dispute, that is a claim under the TPA, arose and thereafter BSLS and its
lawyers considered how such a claim might be advanced. On that date, however, BSLS
had suffered no loss or damage upon which to found a claim under the TPA. The
payment by BSLS of the sum awarded by the Supreme Court, on or after 19 August
2016, resulted for the first time in damage suffered by BSLS that was essential to give
rise to jurisdiction under the TPA. Making the payment that had this result was an abuse

of process. It does not matter whether or not the payment was made deliberately in order

to create jurisdiction under the TPA, albeit Panama’s case is that it was. The chronology

of the sequence of the relevant events is, of itself, enough to constitute the abuse.

In support of its submission Panama relies on Philip Morris.*”* That case was one of a
series in which corporate restructuring had taken place that had brought the claimant
company within the protection of an investment treaty at a time when it was foreseeable
that a dispute might arise that would give rise to jurisdiction under the treaty. At
paragraph 554 the tribunal set out the following statement of principle derived from the

cases:

“[...] the initiation of a treaty-based investor-State arbitration

constitutes an abuse of rights (or an abuse of process, the rights

abused being procedural in nature) when an investor has changed

its corporate structure to gain the protection of an investment treaty

at a point in time when a specific dispute was foreseeable.”
Panama’s case is that this principle applies in the present case. At the time that BSLS
paid the damages and costs awarded by the Supreme Court a dispute under the TPA was
foreseeable. The payment by BSLS had the effect of creating jurisdiction in relation to

that dispute. It follows that the payment was an abuse of process.

The analogy that Panama seeks to draw with cases of corporate restructuring is not exact.
The corporate structure of the Bridgestone Group was not changed in order to gain the
protection of the TPA. Nor was the payment made by BSLS necessary to create
jurisdiction for the claim by BSLS. All the elements necessary to enable BSLS to bring a
claim under the TPA were in existence as soon as the Supreme Court had delivered its
judgment awarding damages against BSJ and BSLS. The claim brought by BSLS is not
limited to the payment that it made on or after 19 August 2016 in discharge of the
Supreme Court’s award. BSLS has a separate claim in relation to damage alleged to have
been done to its investment, the FIRESTONE trademark registered in Panama, by the
Supreme Court’s judgment. This mirrors the claim made by BSAM in relation to the
damage alleged to have been made to its investment, the license to use the FIRESTONE

trademark, by the Supreme Court’s judgment. BSLS further contends that the award of

329.

330.

331.

damages and costs made against it and BSJ, itself constituted damage giving rise to a
claim, even before it discharged that liability by payment. Thus, the principle set out by

the tribunal in Philip Morris has no direct application.

It seems to the Tribunal that the gravamen of Panama’s case of abuse of process is that,
by deliberately discharging the entirety of the judgment debt against itself and BSJ, its
parent company, BSLS made that sum part of its claim under the TPA to the benefit of its
parent, which indisputably lacks standing to bring a claim under the TPA. It may well be
that BSLS’s motive for paying the entirety of the judgment debt was to achieve that end.
Whether it was or not, the consequences of BSLS’s payment is an issue that will fall to be
resolved if and when quantum comes to be considered. It does not follow that the whole

of the payment will be recoverable as loss sustained by BSLS.

There was, in the opinion of the Tribunal, nothing improper or colorable in BSLS
discharging the whole of the judgment debt for which it was jointly liable when it did.
Where two related companies are under a joint liability against which one is insured and
one is not, it may make sound commercial sense for the one that is insured to discharge
the entire liability in the hope that this may be covered by its insurance, whether at the
end of the day this proves to be the case or not. The same is true in respect of the

position of BSJ and BSLS.

For these reasons, there is no basis upon which it would be proper to strike out this head

of claim as an abuse of process. The Tribunal dismisses Objection No. 4.

OBJECTIONS RELATING TO BOTH BSAM AND BSLS

Fifth Objection: The Tribunal Cannot Entertain Claims Based on Hypothetical
Actions of Other States

(1) The Parties’ Positions

a. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that there is no jurisdictional basis for the claim for over
US$10 million dollars (in excess of the US$ 5,431,000 million ordered by the Supreme
Court judgment) for “the ‘loss’ that supposedly ‘has been and will be incurred’” as a

result of the Supreme Court decision.*”°

In particular, Panama takes issue with the Claimants’ contentions that (i) the loss arises
out of the fact that the Supreme Court decision may be followed by other countries in
Latin America, or (ii) may lead to more trademark applications similar and confusingly
similar to the Bridgestone mark in Panama and other Latin American countries.*”
Referring to Articles 10.17, 10.1 and 10.16 of the TPA, Panama argues that “[t]he only
claims that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain are claims that Panama allegedly
has breached the TPA, though ‘measures’ that Panama ‘has adopted or maintained’”,
and therefore, the Tribunal “cannot entertain claims based on the hypothetical actions of

other States [...].”477

According to the Respondent, this conclusion is supported by two principles of
international law, namely, “that each State is responsible for its own conduct and in
respect of its own international obligations” and that “a tribunal cannot adjudicate any
claim where ‘the vital issue to be settled concerns the international responsibility of a
third State.’””*"® The Respondent points out that while Article 10.1.2 of the TPA states

that the TPA Party’s obligations apply to a state enterprise or other person that exercises

governmental authority, it says nothing about extending that to the conduct of other

States.47

For Panama, the issue is not a matter of causation, but rather of consent.*8° This is so,
Panama explains, because consent is limited to claims for breaches of Articles 10.1 to
Article 10.14 of the TPA, and those obligations only apply with respect to “measures

adopted or maintained by a [TPA] Party [...].”. “They do not apply in respect of

(hypothetical) measures that other States (might) thereafter adopt in reaction thereto.”**!

The Respondent explains that this objection does not need to address all of the four
“inter-related” factors underlying the US$ 10 million claim, nor could it have given the
nature of the objection. As Claimants argue that it is the “combination” of the various
factors which led to the loss, a problem with two of those factors is enough to defeat the

claim.**

However, Panama adds, “if it ever came a time when the Tribunal needed to consider”
whether those other factors have any merit, it would find flaws: (i) they amount to the
assertion that BSAM’s non-payment of the judgement prevented it from reinvesting in
sale, marketing and distribution of products; (ii) “Claimants are requesting damages
based on the hypothetical future conduct of private actors’; and (iii) the Tribunal is being
asked to accept that “Bridgestone” trademark policy efforts did not cause injury to
competitors, but that trademark applications by competitors injure the Claimants.**? The

Respondent goes on to conclude that:

“[F]or present purposes, those other factors do not matter. The
issue here is that Claimants are asserting claims based on the
conduct of other States, but the TPA does not impose any
obligations on Panama in respect of their conduct, and
international law in any event precludes the Tribunal from

evaluating such conduct without the consent of those other States.
Claimants do not provide any real response on this issue.”

 

338. In the Post-Hearing Brief, Panama sums up the objection saying that the Claimants’
attempt to seek compensation for “hypothetical future injury that supposedly will result
from hypothetical future action of States other than Panama” is “improper” for two

reasons:485

e First, consent to arbitration in the TPA is limited to claims arising out of measures
already “adopted or maintained” and the resulting damage already incurred.**° (The
Respondent rejects the allegation that this aspect of the problem was not mentioned
before the Hearing.**”)

e Second, Chapter 10 of the TPA does not apply to investments in other States or to
measures by other States different from Panama.*** Dismissing the allegation that
the only measure at issue is the Supreme Court judgement from which the conduct of
the other States flows causally, the Respondent argues that this type of reasoning
would only work if the other State had committed an internationally wrongful-act,**”
which is an issue the Tribunal cannot evaluate.4°

339. The Respondent emphasizes that it is not asking the Tribunal to make findings about the
quantum of the alleged injury, but rather, to confirm that it lacks jurisdiction over “(/)
hypothetical future events or injury, (2) investments outside of Panama, or (3) the
conduct of other States.”*°'! Once that is done, Panama argues, there is no remaining
claim for damages by BSAM and the only remaining claim for BSLS is for the payment

of the Supreme Court damages award (if it survives the other jurisdictional

challenges).*?

b. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants ask the Tribunal to dismiss this objection.*°? | According to their last
submission, the objection should be dismissed for either of the following alternative
reasons: (i) it is not a matter of competence; (ii) it is intertwined with the merits, and all
the necessary evidence is not before the Tribunal such that the Respondent has not
discharged its burden of proof; or (iii) if the objection is a matter of competence and the
Tribunal has sufficient evidence before it to decide it safely, then it should conclude that
there is nothing for the Tribunal to decide as there is no claim for actions by other

States.4°4
The Claimants argue that this objection fails as:

e It only impacts two of the four possible grounds for loss under this head of damage.
And even though the four grounds are “inter-related” that does not mean that they
are inextricably linked so that if one fails all do.”

e The loss claimed arises directly out of the decision of Panama’s Supreme Court, and
the TPA does not preclude a claim for loss suffered outside of Panama or the United
States, as long as it meets the basic test for causation.*%°

e In reality, the objection relates to matters of causation, foreseeability and loss, and it
cannot be determined under Article 10.20.5 of the TPA, because it is not a
jurisdictional objection, and would require extensive evidence to be resolved.”

The Claimants observe, however, that “it appears that this objection is not directed to the

facts of causation and loss” and for that reason they have not put in evidence of fact on

8

the matter.*°® Under the Article 10.20.5 proceeding on preliminary objections, the

Respondent is not allowed to argue that the Claimants cannot show causation, which is an

issue that can only be dealt with a trial.4°?

In addition, according to the Claimants, “there is nothing for the Tribunal to decide at
this point”, since the Claimants do not claim for measures adopted by other States, and
agree that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear those claims.*°° The Claimants
explain that they accept that if the measures of other States caused loss to the Claimants
that would not be recoverable, but argue that this is a “question of fact as to what has

caused the loss and to what extent the measures result in loss.”>°!

Finally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent raised a new objection during the
Hearing that did not appear in the written pleadings, namely, one concerning
“hypothetical future actions of private actors.”*° Because this objection was not raised
within the 45-day time limit prescribed in Article 10.20.5 of the TPA, the Claimants

argue, it is out of time and must be dismissed.>°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Dealing with the last point first, the Tribunal agrees that it is not open to Panama to
pursue, outside the 45-day period, the general objection that the Claimants cannot
advance a claim founded on the hypothetical future actions of private actors. Objection
No. 5 is limited to the contention that the Claimants cannot advance a claim based on the
hypothetical action of other States. Furthermore, the only timely grounds for this
Objection were those set out at paragraph 334 supra, not that the alleged actions of other

States were hypothetical and future.

This Objection arises out of the following passages in the Claimants’ Request for

Arbitration:

“56. Second, the decision of the Panamanian Supreme Court may
be followed in other Latin American countries as a matter of
government policy. Many countries in Latin America have
historically followed each other’s lead in the implementation of

Claimants object that the decision was “unjust and arbitrary.

rights, and the decision of the Panamanian Supreme Court operates
as a de facto protectionist device, allowing potentially confusingly
similar marks to enter into the market because intellectual property
rights holders are unwilling to risk significant, apparently arbitrary,
penalties for their good faith use of the legal mechanisms intended
to preserve those rights. [...]

57. Third, the decision of the Panamanian Supreme Court
establishes a precedent that is likely to be followed in other Latin
American legal systems. Such concerns are warranted in light of
the fact that it is not uncommon for ideas developed in the courts
in one national legal system to be transferred to another. [...]

58. Fourth, the decision of the Panamanian Supreme Court to

Luque Group, operate all over the Americas. There is therefore a
significant risk that the Luque Group will seek to achieve the same
result in those and other jurisdictions across the region. Other
unrelated competitors are also likely to use this opportunity to
follow the Luque Group’s lead and try to enter the various tire
markets in the region by filing and using confusingly similar
trademarks.

59. Accordingly, the risk that similar decisions may be issued in
other countries makes it much costlier for Bridgestone to invest not
only in Panama, but in other countries in Latin America.”>°+

In order to follow these averments it is necessary to consider what it is that the Claimants

allege was objectionable about the decision of the Panamanian Supreme Court. The

99505

understands this allegation to be fact specific. The Claimants do not suggest that Muresa
was pursuing a new and unrecognized cause of action that the Panamanian courts should
never have entertained. No complaint is made of the reasoning and approach of the two
Panamanian lower courts. The complaint is that, in reversing the decision of the lower
courts, the majority in the Panamanian Supreme Court perversely ignored the evidence,

or lack of evidence, and the reasoning based upon it by the lower courts:

“In its decision, the Supreme Court did not consider evidence

submitted by Bridgestone nor the decision of the Eleventh Circuit

Court and the First Superior Court, which found that Bridgestone

had not acted recklessly in opposing the trademark, and that

Muresa and TGLF had not suffered any harm caused by the

trademark opposition action.”>°°
What then is intended by the Claimants’ allegation in paragraph 56 that “the decision of
the Panamanian Supreme Court may be followed in other Latin American countries as a
matter of government policy”? This appears to be suggesting administrative, not judicial,
activity for paragraph 57 deals with the latter. The Tribunal reads this as suggesting that
by some form of executive action the governments of other Latin American countries
may penalize the owners of trademarks that take legitimate action to protect those

trademarks.

And what is suggested by paragraph 57? What is the precedent alleged to have been set
by the Panamanian Supreme Court; is it the perverse disregard of evidence? It seems to
the Tribunal that both paragraph 56 and paragraph 57 envisage that other Latin American
countries may, in one way or another, be influenced by the example of the Panama
Supreme Court to act — if the allegations are to be accepted — in abuse of recognized

intellectual property rights.

As the Tribunal reads paragraph 58, the scenario there painted in relation to countries
outside Panama is premised on the likelihood that the governments and the courts of
these countries will copy the abuse of intellectual property rights shown by the Supreme
Court of Panama. This is evident from paragraph 59. The Claimants have made it clear
that they do not seek to impose on Panama liability for the direct consequences of actions
by other States. What, however, they are seeking to do is to impose liability for the
indirect consequences of those actions, namely the challenges to the Claimants’

intellectual property rights that the predicted actions by other States will encourage.

The contention made by Panama in its Expedited Objections is that this head of claim

requires the Tribunal to evaluate the likelihood of States other than Panama committing

intentionally wrongful acts, and that this is something that the Tribunal has no

jurisdiction to do under established principles of international law.°°”

Panama submits that it would be contrary to international law for the Tribunal to rule on
the likelihood of sovereign States committing wrongs when those States are not subject to
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Panama relies on the decision of the International Court

of Justice in the Monetary Gold Case.*°

That case concerned a dispute between the
United Kingdom and Italy as to whether Italy had a prior claim to gold owned by Albania
that Albania wished to be paid to the United Kingdom. This depended upon whether or
not Italy had a claim against Albania to be paid the gold that took priority over that of the
United Kingdom. Although the United Kingdom and Italy had agreed to the jurisdiction
of the International Court of Justice, Albania had not. In these circumstances the Court

ruled that it had no jurisdiction to decide the issue as:

“[...] To adjudicate upon the international responsibility of

Albania without her consent would run counter to a well-

established principle of international law embodied in the Court’s

Statute, namely, that the Court can only exercise jurisdiction over a

State with its consent.”5°°
The Tribunal does not consider that this decision is precisely in point. The Monetary
Gold case involved rival claims to be paid by Albania gold owned by Albania and thus
Albania was directly concerned with the result. In the present case, a finding as to the
likely conduct of Latin American countries other than Panama would not purport to affect
their legal rights or amount to an assertion of jurisdiction over them. Nonetheless, the
Tribunal considers that it would be an extraordinary interpretation of the ICSID
Convention and the TPA that would bring within the jurisdiction of ICSID a dispute as to
whether or not sovereign States not party to the TPA are likely to act in abuse of

established intellectual property rights and, if they are, whether the respondent host State

is liable for the consequences. Neither the United States, nor Panama could possibly

have envisaged such a claim arising under the TPA, and for good reason.

In the opinion of the Tribunal, a dispute as to whether States other than Panama are likely
to copy Panama’s alleged abuse of the Claimants’ intellectual property rights to the
detriment of the Claimants is both speculative and remote from each of the Claimants’
investments. That part of the overall dispute cannot possibly be said to “arise directly
out of’ either Claimant’s investment. Thus, so far as BSAM is concerned, this Objection
succeeds not by reason of the grounds relied on in support of it but by reason of the

grounds advanced in support of Objection No. 2.

What is the position of BSLS? Objection No. 2 was only made against BSAM. Is it open
to the Tribunal to uphold Objection No. 5 against BSLS not on the grounds advanced in
support of that Objection but on the grounds advanced against BSAM in Objection No.
2? The Tribunal does not consider that it is. Accordingly, so far as BSLS is concerned
Objection No. 5 must be dismissed. But the Tribunal will add this. BSLS will no doubt
consider carefully whether to pursue a claim in relation to events outside Panama in
circumstances where the Tribunal has ruled that it has no jurisdiction to entertain an

identical clam by BSAM.

COSTS

The Parties’ Positions

Panama has requested that the Claimants be held “jointly and severally” liable for all the

costs of the arbitration.*!°

Contrary to the Claimants’ allegations at the Hearing, the
Respondent argues that it is inapposite that some objections relate to one of the Claimants
and not the others: the Claimants decided to bring the case jointly, have tried to argue it

blurring the lines between the Claimants, and should not be permitted to draw a line now,

when the record demonstrates that BSLS is entirely dependent financially from BSJ and

loans from affiliates.>!!

Panama submits that its cost and expenses in this expedited phase amount to US$
$1,691,447.72, consisting of (i) advance payments made to ICSID; (ii) counsel’s fees and

expenses; and (iii) fees and expenses of a non-testifying expert.>!*

In turn, the Claimants have asked for “an order requiring the Respondent to pay the costs

513 rather than to wait until a final award is rendered at the

of its Objections immediately’
end of the proceeding.*'* In their Response on Expedited Objections, the Claimants have
explained that the request is grounded inter alia on Panama’s non-cooperative approach,
and its refusal to explain prior to the Response the basis for the contention that Article
10.20.4(c) does not apply to an Article 10.20.5 expedited procedure.*'* This, the
Claimants argue, has left them with little option but to submit evidence in relation to
numerous factual matters raised in the objections (without prejudice to their position that
such evidence was unnecessary), putting them through more effort and cost, and leaving

the Tribunal with a greater volume of submissions and evidence.

As to the Respondent’s request for a cost award holding both Claimants jointly and
severally liable, the Claimants submitted that in considering that request, the Tribunal
would have to also consider the specific nature of its decision given that some objections

are addressed only to one of the Claimants or to the other.*!°

The Claimants submit that their costs and expenses in this expedited phase amount to

US$1,179,110.97,5"7 consisting of counsel’s fees and expenses.

The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal considers that it will be better placed to resolve issues of costs at the end of
this arbitration and will therefore make no order as to costs at this stage.

DECISION

For the reasons set out above the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) Objection No. | is dismissed.

(2) Objection No. 2 is dismissed in respect of damage alleged to have been sustained
within Panama but allowed in respect of damage alleged to have been sustained
outside Panama.

(3) Objection No. 3 is dismissed.

(4) Objection No. 4 is dismissed.

(5) Objection No. 5 is allowed as against BSAM on the grounds advanced by Panama in
support of Objection No. 2 but dismissed as against BSLS.

(6) The Tribunal reserves all questions of costs.
