INTRODUCTION
THE PARTIES

The Claimant is Alcor Holdings Ltd. (“Alcor” or the “Claimant’), a company incorporated under
the laws of the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”) and registered at P.O. Box 186549, Dubai,
UAE. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Vii and
Mr QR 0 Tavcorwessinc LLP (Dubai Branch), 26" Floor, Rolex Tower
Sheikh Zayed Road, P.O. Box 33675, Dubai, UAE; and i FE
Ha. (i of TAYLORWESSING E|N|W|C ADVOKATI V.0.S., U

Pra&né brany 1, 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic.

The Respondent is the Czech Republic, (the “State” or the “Respondent”, and together with the
Claimant, the “Parties”). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Ms Martina
Matejova, Mr Jaroslav Kudrna, and Mr Martin Novaéek of the MINISTRY OF FINANCE, Letenska
15, 118 10 Prague 1, Czech Republic; and Mr A Ms I anc vs
i of CHAFFETZ LINDSEY LLP, 1700 Broadway, 33" Floor, New York, NY 10019, United

States of America.

BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE

This arbitration concerns the Czech Republic’s alleged breach of its obligations under Articles 2
and 3 of the Agreement Between the Government of the Czech Republic and the Government of
the United Arab Emirates for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 23 November
1994 (the “Treaty”)' with respect to the Claimant’s alleged investment in a number of land plots
upon which the City of Prague (the “City” or “Prague”) maintains public roads and auxiliary

communications.”

At the heart of this dispute is a disagreement about the Claimant’s entitlement to, and the measure
of compensation for, alleged unjust enrichment in respect of the City’s use of land owned by the
Claimant’s former subsidiary, Alcor Holdings CZ. s.r.o. (“Alcor CZ”). The Claimant contends
that the Treaty entitles it to compensation under a formula set out in a municipal regulation
(“Resolution No. 2141”), adopted by the City, that determines how much rent the City can charge

when leasing its own land for particular purposes to third parties. According to the Claimant, the

The Treaty entered into force on 25 December 1995.

The term “communication” (komunikace) as used throughout the record appears to refer to structures such
as local roads and ramps.

PCA Case No. 2018-45
Award
Page 2 of 78

same formula must be applied to cases in which the City operates structures such as roads and
utilities on land belonging to a private party. The Claimant maintains that Alcor CZ was at all
material times the owner of various plots of land in the City (the “Plots”) on which the City had

built and operated roads and other utilities.

The Respondent argues that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimant is not a covered
“investor” and lacks a covered “investment” within the meaning of those terms in the Treaty. It
also raises several other preliminary objections to the admissibility of the Claimant’s claims
(namely, that the Claimant structured its investment specifically to invoke Treaty jurisdiction, that
the Claimant seeks supranational review of Czech court judgments, and that the Claimant is
pursuing multiple recovery). With regard to the merits, the Respondent submits that, pursuant to
a judgment issued by a Czech court (and subsequently upheld upon appeal at all levels of the
judicial system), the City has already paid compensation to Alcor CZ in the amount required
under Czech law. It disputes the claim that the formula to be used in such a case is that contained

in Resolution No. 2141 and maintains that its conduct has involved no breach of the Treaty.

THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

Article 9 of the Treaty sets out the the offer of each Contracting Party to arbitrate with investors

of the other Contracting Party:

ARTICLE 9

SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES BETWEEN
A CONTRACTING STATE AND AN INVESTOR
OF THE OTHER CONTRACTING STATE

1. Any dispute which may arise between an investor of one Contracting State and the
other Contracting State in connection with an investment on the territory of that other
contracting State, shall be subject to negotiations between the parties in dispute.

2. If any dispute between an investor of one Contracting State and the other Contracting
State can not be thus settled within a period of six months, the investor shall be entitled
to submit the case either to:

 

a) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) having
regard to the applicable provisions of the Convention on the Settlements of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for
signature at Washington D.C. on 13th March 1965; or

b) an arbitrator or international ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL). The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify
these Rules. The arbitral awards shall be final and binding on both Parties to
the dispute.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

On 30 June 2016, the Claimant notified the Respondent of a dispute under the Treaty.

Through subsequent correspondence, the Respondent informed the Claimant that it did not accept

the Claimant’s proposal for amicable settlement.

On 3 May 2018, the Claimant initiated these arbitration proceedings by serving a Notice of
Arbitration dated 17 April 2018 (the “Notice of Arbitration”) on the Respondent under Article
9(2)(b) of the Treaty. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant relied on the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, 2013.

By letter dated 1 June 2018, the Respondent argued that, as the Treaty was concluded in 1995,
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 1976 (the “1976 UNCITRAL Rules” or the “UNCITRAL
Rules”) apply to these proceedings, and proposed the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the
“PCA”) to administer the proceedings. The Claimant agreed to the Respondent’s proposal for
the PCA to administer the proceedings, but maintained its position on the applicability of the

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 2013.

On 12 July 2018, the Claimant appointed Mr Richard Wilmot-Smith QC as arbitrator.
Mr Wilmot-Smith’s address is 81 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1DD, United Kingdom.

On 22 August 2018, the Respondent appointed Professor Donald McRae, CC, ONZM, as
arbitrator. Professor McRae’s address is the Faculty of Law, Common Law Section, University

of Ottawa, 57 Louis Pasteur, Ottawa, Ontario KIN 6N5, Canada.

On 21 September 2018, the two co-arbitrators informed the Parties that they had appointed
Sir Christopher Greenwood, GBE, CMG, QC as presiding arbitrator. Sir Christopher’s address
is Magdalene College, Cambridge, CB3 OLH, United Kingdom.

On 5 October 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, enclosing drafts of Procedural Order No. |
and the Terms of Appointment and inviting the Parties to provide their comments on the enclosed

drafts.

On 9 October 2018, the PCA transmitted to the Parties Declarations of Acceptance and Statements

of Impartiality and Independence duly completed and signed by each member of the Tribunal.

Award
Page 4 of 78

On 22 October 2018, the Parties submitted a jointly agreed mark-up of the draft Terms of
Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1.

On 12 November 2018, the Tribunal conducted a procedural conference call with the Parties to

discuss their comments on the draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1.

Following the procedural conference, on 19 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural

Order No. 1, including a procedural calendar for the proceedings.

On 21 November 2018, the Tribunal issued its Terms o f A ppointment—as revised in
consultation with the Parties—for signature by the Parties and each member of the Tribunal. The

Terms of Appointment provided, inter alia:

(a) _ that the seat of arbitration would be The Hague, the Netherlands;

(b) _ that the language of the arbitration would be English;

(c) _ that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules would apply to these proceedings,

(d) _ that the PCA would administer the proceedings, and

(e) that Vi Senior Legal Counsel of the PCA would act as Tribunal Secretary.

On 3 December 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties proposing the appointment of Ms
i as assistant to the Presiding Arbitrator. The Tribunal enclosed a copy of Ms 7
curriculum vitae with its letter. On 10 and 11 December 2019, the Respondent and the Claimant
confirmed that they had no objections to Ms appointment. On 16 December 2019, the
Presiding Arbitrator circulated Ms cectaration of confidentiality to the Parties, who
confirmed the following day that they were satisfied with Ms declaration.

WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS AND DOCUMENT PRODUCTION
On 28 November 2018, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim, together with, inter alia,

a witness statement by Vii (the ; Witness Statement”).

On 14 December 2018, the Respondent sent a letter to the Claimant asserting that the Statement
of Claim did not contain sufficient details on, inter alia, “the elements of treaty and international
law allegedly breached by the Republic” and “the Claimant’s corporate structure and identity

supporting the tribunal’s jurisdiction under the relevant treaty text”. The Respondent requested

that the Claimant either particularize its claim, or confirm that it would not subsequently submit

additional evidence.

The Claimant rejected the Respondent’s complaints in an e-mail of 18 December 2018, asserting

that “[t]he Claimant’s case in this matter is straightforward and has been clearly pleaded”.

By letter dated 10 January 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order that the
Claimant particularize its claims and provide all available evidence and authorities it intends to

rely upon. By letter dated 17 January 2019, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to reject this request.

On 24 January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, denying the Respondent’s
request and noting that it would consider document production requests in accordance with the

provisions and timeline set out in Procedural Order No. 1.

On 29 March 2019, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence, together with, inter alia,

a witness statement by (the “First Witness Statement”).

On 9 and 10 May 2019, each Party produced to the other Party documents responsive to
uncontested document requests exchanged between the Parties in accordance with Procedural

Order No. 1.

On 27 May 2019, the Parties submitted their remaining contested documents requests to the

Tribunal for its determination.

On 13 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, ordering the Parties to produce
documents in accordance with the enclosed Annex A and Annex B, respectively setting out the

Tribunal’s decisions on the Claimant’s and the Respondent’s document requests.

On 26 June 2019, the Claimant produced documents responsive to the Tribunal’s orders in

Annex A to Procedural Order No. 3.

On 27 June 2019, the Respondent produced documents responsive to the Tribunal’s order in

Annex B to Procedural Order No. 3.

On 4 July 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, noting that the Parties’ production of documents
on 26 and 27 July 2019, as well as the Claimant’s production of documents on 9 May 2019, had
all copied the Tribunal. The Tribunal recalled that pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1 such
correspondence should not be copied to the Tribunal, and advised the Parties that documents

produced would form part of the record and be considered by the Tribunal only if submitted as

exhibits to the Parties’ remaining written submissions (i.e., the Claimant’s Reply and the

Respondent's Rejoinder).

On 26 August 2019, the Claimant submitted its Reply, together with, inter alia, an expert report

by Associate Professors and dated 23 August 2019 (the | Hi

Expert Opinion”).

On 7 October 2019, with the Claimant’s consent, the Respondent sought an extension of the
deadline for submitting its Rejoinder from 31 October 2019 to 29 November 2019. The Tribunal

granted the request on the same date.

On 26 November 2019, with the Claimant’s consent, the Respondent sought a further extension
of the deadline for submitting its Rejoinder from 29 November 2019 to 6 December 2019. The

Tribunal granted the request the next day.

On 6 December 2019, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder, together with, inter alia, an expert

report by | (the | Expert O pinion”) and a second witness
statement by (the “Second Witness Statement’).

On 18 February 2020, the Respondent produced as an additional exhibit (R-134) a copy of a
decision by the Czech Supreme Court in Alcor Holdings CZ s.r.o. v. City of Prague, dated
17 December 2019.

On 3 March 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, admitting the additional exhibit
R-134 submitted by the Respondent to the record and ruling that no further documents might be
submitted except in accordance with the rules set forth in the procedural order governing

documents produced for the hearing or as otherwise permitted by the Tribunal.

HEARING PREPARATION AND POSTPONEMENT

In March and April 2019, the Parties and the Tribunal confirmed their availability for a hearing
to take place between 30 March and 2 April 2020 in The Hague in accordance with paragraph 9.1
of Procedural Order No. 1.

By e-mail dated 13 January 2020, the Parties notified the Tribunal that after conferring with each
other, the Parties were agreed that they preferred to hold the hearing in Prague. On the same date,

the Tribunal agreed with the Parties proposal to change the hearing location to Prague.

On 2 March 2020, the Tribunal and Parties held a Pre-Hearing Teleconference to discuss the

protocol for the upcoming hearing in Prague.

On 4 March 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 setting forth details of the hearing
to take place in Prague on 30 and 31 March 2020 with 1 April 2020 held in reserve.

On 12 March 2020, the Parties contacted the Tribunal acknowledging the rapidly developing
COVID-19 pandemic and seeking leave to discuss potential alternatives to a hearing in Prague on

30 and 31 March 2020. The Tribunal granted that leave on the same date.

On 13 March 2020, the Parties jointly notified the Tribunal that in light of the worsening COVID-
19 situation, they considered it impossible to have an in-person hearing in Prague or in any other
location on 30 and 31 March 2020. The Parties also notified the Tribunal that they considered it
impractical to organize a hearing by video-conference to be conducted on the appointed dates.
The Parties conveyed their agreement that the 30 and 31 March 2020 hearing should be vacated

and postponed to a later date.

On 16 March 2020, the Presiding Arbitrator conducted a conference call with the Parties to

discuss potential dates for a postponed hearing.

On 11 and 12 July 2020, after several rounds of correspondence, the Parties confirmed their
availability for a hearing to be held on 14 and 15 December 2020. On 27 August 2020, the
Tribunal invited the Parties to provide comments regarding the format of the hearing in light of
the continuing public health and logistical difficulties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The
Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and consider whether an in person hearing would be feasible
or preferable, or whether the Parties would prefer to conduct a video hearing, building upon

experience with video proceedings developed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 11 September 2020, the Parties notified the Tribunal of their agreement, in light of the ongoing
public health circumstances, to proceed by way of a video-conference hearing on 14 and 15

December 2020. The Parties noted that they were conferring on a remote hearing protocol.

THE INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

On 8 September 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal seeking leave to introduce into the
record a 2 June 2020 resolution of the Czech Constitutional Court in the litigation between Alcor
Holdings CZ s.r.o. and the City of Prague. The Respondent reported that it had conferred with
the Claimant, which had advised that it had no objection to introducing the 2 June 2020 resolution
into the record, so long as the Claimant would be permitted to submit an addendum to the
| Expert Opinion addressing the 2 June 2020 resolution. The Respondent informed the
Tribunal that it agreed with the Claimant’s proposal, on the condition that the Respondent would

have the opportunity to respond to any such addendum submitted by the Claimant.

On 9 September 2020, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment on the Respondent’s request
to introduce the Czech Constitutional Court’s resolution as well as on a proposed page limit for

any potential supplemental expert report.

On 22 September 2020, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal on behalf of both Parties recording
the Parties’ agreement to a ten-page limit for further expert testimony on the 2 June 2020

resolution of the Czech Constitutional Court.

By an e-mail of 12 October 2020, following another round of correspondence between the
Tribunal and the Parties regarding applicable deadlines, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties
its decision: (a) admitting the 2 June 2020 Czech Constitutional Court resolution as an additional
exhibit (R-135); (b) granting leave to the Claimant to file an addendum of no more than 10 pages
to the | Expert Opinion by 19 October 2020; and (c) granting leave to the
Respondent to file a reply of no more than 10 pages to the Claimant’s addendum by 9 November

2020.

On 19 October 2020, the Claimant submitted a supplemental expert report of Professors [i

|| and ; | dated 14 October 2020 (the “Supplemental | Expert

Opinion”) addressing the legal significance of Constitutional Court decisions.

On 9 November 2020, the Respondent submitted the supplemental expert report o

il (the “Supplemental Expert Opinion”) in response to the Supplemental
i Expert Opinion.

THE PARTIES’ SKELETON ARGUMENTS AND THE HEARING

On 26 October 2020, after conferring with each other and with the PCA, the Parties submitted a

draft Agreed Protocol for a Remote Hearing for the Tribunal’s consideration.

On 13 November 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, setting out the protocol for
the December 2020 hearing based substantially on the draft protocol that the Parties had agreed.
The Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would take place remotely between 14 and 16 December.
At the Tribunal’s invitation, the Claimant and Respondent indicated their agreement to the
procedures set out in Procedural Order No. 5 by returning signed copies on 15 and 14 November

2020 respectively.

On 14 November 2020, the Claimant submitted its Skeleton Opening for Hearing (the
“Claimant’s Skeleton”) and the Respondent submitted its Skeleton Argument (the

“Respondent’s Skeleton”).

PCA Case No. 2018-45
Award
Page 9 of 78

By letter to the Tribunal dated 20 November 2020, the Respondent contended that the Claimant’s
Skeleton asserted for the first time breaches of “Articles 2(12) [sic] ... 2(4)(i) and 2(4)(ii) and
2(10)” of the Treaty. According to the Respondent, these breaches had not previously been
pleaded by the Claimant, and that permitting the Claimant to introduce them at that late stage

would result in prejudice to the Respondent.

By letter to the Tribunal dated 23 November 2020, the Claimant replied to the Respondent’s
allegations with respect to the breaches asserted in the Claimant’s Skeleton, and argued that the

substance of its claims, especially with regard to Article 2(1) and 2(10), were not new.

By letter to the Tribunal dated 24 November 2020, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s
failure to adhere to page limits in its Claimant’s Skeleton and to the Claimant’s attempts to
introduce additional exhibits and appendices into the record. The Respondent also responded to
the arguments in the Claimant’s 23 November 2020 letter that its Articles 2(1) and 2(10) claims
were not new, and registered its objections to what it characterized as the Claimant’s attempts to

introduce new evidentiary and substantive arguments under existing heads of claim.

By letter to the Parties dated 27 November 2020, the Tribunal notified the Parties of its decision,
inter alia, (a) striking Annex A to the Claimant’s Skeleton; (b) denying leave to the Claimant to
submit two additional annexes to the Claimant’s Skeleton; (c) denying the Respondent’s request
to strike out other parts of the Claimant’s Skeleton; (d) granting the Respondent additional time
at the Hearing to respond to arguments raised in the Claimant’s Skeleton; (e) requesting the
Claimant to submit a comprehensive list of Treaty provisions upon which it relied as forming the
basis of its claim; and (f) requesting the Parties to submit agreed versions of the Treaty, a

chronology, dramatis personae, and indices of legal authorities.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
THE LEGAL CONTEXT OF THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT

Between 1948 and 1989 Czechoslovakia was under communist rule.? Throughout this period,
Czechoslovakian law did not recognize unified title (or superficies solo cedit), the legal principle
that structures built on land belonged to the owner of the land. From 1951 it was possible under
the Communist-era civil code for structures built upon land to be owned and alienated by persons
other than the owners of the underlying land.* Communist rule ended in November 1989. In

1993 Czechoslovakia was dissolved and the Czech Republic became a separate State. *

The rule that structures do not form part of the land remained in place until the present Czech
Civil Code (the “2014 Civil Code’) entered into force on | January 2014, reintroducing the
principle of superficies solo cedit:®
Section 506(1). Component parts of a plot of land include the space above and below the
surface, structures erected on the plot of land and other facilities (hereinafter a ‘structure’),
except for temporary structures, including what is embedded in the plot of land and attached
to walls.”
Under the 2014 Civil Code, where land and any “linear structure” (such as the roads and auxiliary
communications at issue in this dispute) built on the land are owned by two separate owners, the
structure is treated as separate real property that can be owned and alienated independently of the

the structure becomes part of the property and ceases to exist independently (that is, title to the

land and structure is unified).°

In 1991, the Czech government transferred ownership of public roads to the municipalities served
by the roads, along with a duty to unify title over the land and any structure thereon where a road
or other utility had been built upon privately owned land (sometimes described as a duty to “quiet

title”).!° Following this transfer, owners of land upon which state-owned constructions had been

It is undisputed that the City owes compensation for unjust enrichment to owners of lands
underlying public roads on account of its past use of their lands.'? Claims for compensation are
limited to the three years preceding the date of raising a claim to the City.'? The exact basis on
which the compensation payable is to be calculated is the subject of a disagreement between the

Parties that is central to this arbitration.

According to the Respondent, although compensation for unjust enrichment generally
corresponds to the prevailing rent for comparable land, it may be capped by applicable price

regulations."

The Respondent maintains that Czech law in effect at the time the Claimant
acquired the Plots specified that the amount which the City would pay as unjust enrichment is
based on an appraisal of the prevailing rent for comparable land at a particular location and time
and is capped by the Ministry of Finance in its annual assessments (the “MoF Assessments”).!°
Under the MoF Assessment, the cap on unjust enrichment was set at 85 CZK/m2/year for 2010

and 2011 and was raised to 120 CZK/m2/year from 2012 to 2017.'°

The Claimant maintains that compensation had to follow the market price and that the best
indication of the market price was the amount payable to the City where another party built on

land owned by the City. The amount payable to the City was fixed by Resolution No. 2141.'7

With respect to the area of land that is subject to compensation, [i disagrees with the
Claimant’s experts in pointing out that no compensation is owed for parts of the land where the

landowner’s option to use the land is not excluded by a road or other restriction.'*

THE CLAIMANT AND ITS BUSINESS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC

The Claimant company, Alcor Holdings Ltd (“Alcor”), was established on 30 July 2009 under
the law of the United Arab Emirates with its registered address located in Dubai.'? The Claimant’s
founder, sole shareholder and CEO is MV a dual national of the Czech
Republic and Switzerland.” Beginning in 2009, ui sought to invest in the Czech

Republic by buying land plots occupied by roads and communications owned by the City.”!

ue testified that he established Alcor as a holding company and that its purpose was to
serve as a “vehicle for the investment” which he intended to make in the Czech Republic.” On
a visit to Prague ui was made aware of an investment opportunity related to plots of land
on which municipal roads owned by the City of Prague are located.” ui learned that the
Prague City Administration, as landowner, imposed a charge for third-party use of its land while
providing compensation for placing its own structures on the land of private landowners.” Based
on what he described as the “principle of equality of legal subjects,” ue concluded that
the landowner was owed compensation for unjust enrichment at the rate stipulated by the City’s
own regulation governing leases of the City’s land.*° ui accordingly formulated a
business plan to purchase built-up plots of land and to seek compensation for unjust enrichment
from the City for the period of time during which the City’s roads were located on the plots of

land.”

On 27 May 2009, ui obtained a legal memorandum from Czech lawyer
Hs - ; Memo”).?” The | Memo described the Czech legal

framework and potential risks associated with wi business plan. It determined that in
the absence of legal title (such as a lease agreement) to use the land upon which its road is built,
the City was subject to “a duty to pay the owner of the land for so-called ‘unjust enrichment’
which is equal to what would be otherwise paid in a commercial lease”.** Concerning the amount
payable under either a lease contract concluded with the City or a compensation award sought
against it, the memorandum refers to tariffs established by Resolution No. 2141, promulgated by
the City in 2004.” According to the Memo, Resolution No. 2141 establishes “the
conditions under which it is possible to lease [City]’s plots built-up by the roads to a third
person[s] [sic.]”.*°

The capped rent amount prescribed under Resolution No. 2141 varies according to the use of the
land and the tenure of the use of the land. It is set at either 5 CZK/m7/day (1825 CZK/m//year) if
the term of the original lease agreement between the City and third-party land user is not exceeded

or 10 CZK/m7/day (3650 CZK/m’/year) if the term of the original lease is exceeded.*!

useful to verifiably check with the [City] whether the recovery of the unjust enrichment sum is

Mr admitted that he had not in fact read the case law to which the Memo
referred.“ He testified that he expected that the purchase of these plots would generate both
capital appreciation (on the value of the plots themselves) and a yield from the City for its use of
the land (in the form of either rental payments or an award of compensation for unjust
enrichment).*° His understanding was that Resolution No. 2141 would apply to determine the
amount of compensation payable for the total occupation of a plot of land by a road irrespective
of whether the plot was owned by the City itself or by a third party.*° As such, and assuming the
City would eventually buy the plots of land “for the standard price’, ui was confident

that no written records are made in relation to informal meetings and questions ... that are dealt

ue testified that when Alcor CZ’s initial efforts at contact proved unsuccessful, he
instructed to send written enquiries to the City.** The City’s responses to Alcor
CZ demonstrate that from early 2011 Alcor CZ engaged in correspondence with the City seeking
confirmation that roads and auxiliary communications owned by the City were built upon the
Plots and that Resolution No. 2141 is applied by the City when determining rent for private

parties’ use of land owned by the City.*°

In a letter dated 17 February 2011 the City responded to a letter from Alcor CZ to confirm that
“the Prague City Hall proceeds with the lease and rent of the land” and that Resolution No. 2141

City of Prague, the Capital City of Prague is obliged to resolve such matters through judicial

proceedings.
A similar confirmation was offered by the City in its letter dated 24 March 2014, responding to a
further letter from [EE © The final letter from the City, also dated 24 March 2014,
responds to a request from Alcor CZ for additional information “on the procedure of the Capital
City of Prague in relation to third parties if those persons exceed the agreed lease period of the
land or even use land without concluding a lease contract with the Capital City of Prague”. The
City wrote to say that:

The Capital City of Prague assesses unjust enrichment as the amount of rent that the person

would have been obliged to pay if he were a tenant. In such case that the rent at a given place

and time would be determined according to the Price Policy Principles regarding the rent or

loan for use of roads and their parts, part of land plots and areas owned by the City of Prague,

leased by OOA Prague City Hall and TSK (Technical Management of Communications) of

the City of Prague, which is the part of Annex | of [Resolution No. 2141], then the amount
of the unjust enrichment would also be determined according these principles.

 

The Respondent emphasizes in its submissions that “no City official ever indicated that
Resolution 2141 applied to calculate leases or unjust enrichment for land owned by any party
except the City.”°!

ue testified that his efforts (through the Claimant company and Alcor CZ, in turn) to
conclude a lease agreement with the City in a non-contentious manner ultimately failed, and that

‘complete passivity”.° The Claimant suggests that, “as

the reason for that failure was the latter’s
the reluctance of Prague to settle persisted,[it] had no other option than to proceed in accordance
with the law.”®? Consequently, Alcor instructed Alcor CZ to file a claim for unjust enrichment

with the court of first instance.

On 19 June 2011 Alcor CZ filed a complaint against the City before the 10" Prague District Court

(the “District Court”), in which it requested that the Court determine that the City was the lessee

of the Plots, or, alternatively that the City was obliged to compensate Alcor CZ on the basis of

unjust enrichment.

According to the Respondent, the City first learned of the “dispute” when Alcor CZ filed suit in

the District Court.

On 19 June 2013, Alcor CZ extended its claim and requested further compensation for the use of

the Plots by the City for two additional years.”

On 6 March 2014, the District Court delivered its decision stating that it did not have competence
to decide whether the City was the lessee of the Plots owned by Alcor CZ, which fell under the
“local competence” of the 5™ Prague District Court and the 8 Prague District Court,

respectively.

On 20 March 2014, Alcor CZ partially withdrew the portion of its claim seeking a declaratory
judgment that the City was the lessee of the Plots, thus limiting its claim to one for unjust
enrichment, and petitioned the District Court to hear this remaining claim, which Alcor CZ argued

fell within the District Court’s local competence.”

While the litigation was ongoing, the parties exchanged a number of letters with the aim of settling
their differences. However, these settlement attempts were unsuccessful. The City proposed to
purchase the Plots for an amount determined by an expert body.”” Alcor CZ, on the other hand,
argued that such a purchase would only cover the disposition of the Plots pro futuro, and that
Alcor CZ was entitled to additional compensation, as the past use of the Plots by the City qualified

as an unjust enrichment.”!

According to the Claimant, the City has not negotiated with Alcor CZ pending the outcome of the

litigation in Czech courts.”

As will be explained below (paras. 113 to 115), on 24 February 2016, the Claimant sold its
shareholding in Alcor CZ.

According to the Respondent, the City “repeatedly”’* offered to purchase the Plots at a “sale price
calculated on the basis of independent expert valuation reports,” beginning immediately after
the litigation was commenced in the District Court and extending to at least October 2017. The
Respondent also purports to have followed up with further offers for both buyouts (most recently
at CZK 32,288,000 or approximately US$ 1.4 million) and easements over the Plots (most
recently at CZK 8,070,980 or approximately US$ 350,000).”° The Respondent’s offers were
allegedly rejected by Alcor CZ.” According co Alcor CZ rejected the City’s offer to

establish an easement over the Plots only in April 2019.7”

The overall amount to be paid by the City was CZK

In its reasoning, the District Court rejected Alcor CZ’s request to calculate the damages in
accordance with Resolution No. 2141, as Resolution No. 2141 “clearly refers to the land (after
all, it is evident from the title of the Regulation) that is leased or borrowed for roads and their
components, parts of plots of land and areas of land owned by the Capital City of Prague”.**
Furthermore, the District Court underlined that, while the purchase of the Plots by Alcor CZ might
have been of a speculative nature, the City was under an obligation to pay damages for unjust
enrichment in any event. It also held that the City “would be liable to surrender unjust enrichment
even if the plots of land remained the property of the former owners, and the fact that the former
owners did not claim surrender of the unjust enrichment in the given case cannot be attributed to
the detriment of the Plaintiff.”** Both parties lodged appeals to challenge the First Instance
Judgment. Alcor CZ’s appeal was on the grounds that it should have been entitled to unjust
enrichment at the Resolution No. 2141 rate.*° The City’s appeal alleged inter alia that Alcor CZ
should not have been able to recover anything because its conduct was “speculative and
abusive”.*°

Between October 2017 and February 2018, the City also approached Alcor CZ on a number of
occasions with its offer to purchase the Plots or, alternatively, to create a servitude on the Plots.*”

in the general meeting of Alcor CZ.**

On 4 May 2018, the Municipal Court of Prague rejected the appeals of both sides and upheld the
First Instance Judgment (the “Second Instance Judgment”).*°

Addressing the First and Second Instance Judgments, the Respondent’s expert on Czech law,
a. notes, “[c]ase law demonstrate[s] that courts proceed in disputes between the owner
of the land and the owner of the structure located on the land in a comparable manner to how they

acted in the litigation between Alcor CZ and Prague.”””

On 2 June 2020, the Constitutional Court found that none of Alcor CZ’s constitutionally
guaranteed rights had been breached, rendering Alcor CZ’s constitutional complaint “manifestly
unsubstantiated” pursuant to Section 43, paragraph 2(a) of the Constitutional Court Act.°°
Reasoning that “[dJenial of a constitutional complaint due to manifest unsubstantiality negates
the fundamental condition for considering a proposal to repeal another legal regulation or its part,”
the Constitutional Court also rejected Alcor CZ’s request to repeal portions of the MoF
Assessments for 2010-2016.” The Constitutional Court noted in closing that “[nJo appeal may

be filed against the decision of [the] Constitutional Court.”*8

ALCOR’S SALE OF ALCOR CZ

On 24 February 2016, the Claimant sold its share in Alcor CZ to Mizar Limited (“Mizar”) for
USD 1,000,000 (approx.: CZK 24,566,297). According to the Respondent, the Claimant also
appears to have been compensated by Mizar for money loaned to Alcor CZ for the acquisition of

the Plots.'”

According to the Claimant, the reason for its divestment was that it “no longer intend[ed] to do
business in the Czech Republic in any shape or form”.'' At the hearing, ui testified that
“T was tired of the process, it was much more challenging than I thought it would be, and I did
not necessarily have either the time or the financial resources to keep on going ad aeternum, so it
was smarter to exit, recoup some of the funding, and allocate my time to other ventures like
growing the firm.”!?

The Agreement on transfer of shares between the Claimant and Mizar’ (the “Share Transfer

Agreement”) provides, in Section II paragraphs (2) and (3), that:

IV. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

A JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

116. The Respondent raises five preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and to the

admissibility of the Claimant’s claims, as follows:

(a)

(b)

(©)

Cc)

(e)

1.

that having sold its stake in its former Czech subsidiary Alcor CZ in February 2016, the
Claimant was no longer an “investor” within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the Treaty when

it purported to accept the offer of arbitration under Article 9 of the Treaty;

that the Claimant’s stake in Alcor CZ lacked the indicia —specifically, contribution of
economic value over time, and risk—of an “investment” within the meaning of Article 1(1)

of the Treaty;

that the Claimant structured its investment through a holding company in Dubai with the

express aim of establishing jurisdiction under the Treaty;

that the Claimant seeks to use this arbitration to conduct a “supranational” review of the

judgments of the Respondent’s courts;

that the Claimant is seeking duplicative recovery through this arbitration, since its former
subsidiary Alcor CZ has already received compensation from Prague in the Czech domestic

litigation.

Whether the Claimant was an “Investor” at the Relevant Time

117. Article 1(2)(b) of the Treaty, in relevant part, defines an “investor~” in the following terms:

The term “investor” shall mean the Government of a Contracting State or any of its natural
or juridical persons who invest in the territory of the other Contracting State:

(b) — The term “juridical person” shall mean with respect to either Contracting State, any
entity established and recognized as juridical person by the law of that Contracting
State, such as public and private companies, corporations, business associations,
authorities, partnerships, foundations, firms, institutions, establishments, agencies,
development funds, enterprises, cooperatives and organizations or other similar
entities irrespective of whether their liabilities are limited or otherwise.

   

   

118. Investment is defined in Article 1(1) of the Treaty, the relevant part of which reads as follows:

 

The term “investment” shall comprise every kind of asset invested by ...a ... juridical person
of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State in accordance with the
laws, regulations and administrative practices of that State and shall include in a particular,
though not exclusively:

The Respondent’s Position’

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the Claimant was not

in “investor” within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the Treaty. The Respondent does not contest
that the Claimant is a juridical person recognized as such under the law of the UAE. According
to the Respondent, however, the Claimant had relinquished any standing it might have had as an
investor by voluntarily disposing of its shares in Alcor CZ in the sale to Mizar on 24 February

2016, well before serving its Notice of Arbitration on the Respondent in 2018.'°°

Relying on the decision of the arbitral tribunal in CSOB v. Slovakia, the Respondent asserts that
the critical date to determine the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is the date of commencement of the
arbitral proceedings (the date when the Respondent receives the Notice of Arbitration under the
UNCITRAL Rules).'°° The Respondent further notes that the determination of whether a party
has standing is similarly made by reference to the date of the start of the proceedings.'”

The Respondent submits that there are only “narrow exceptions” to the rule that the Claimant
must have been an investor at the commencement of the arbitration.'°* The Respondent cites
Aven v . C osta Ric a, in which the arbitral tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction under
circumstances which the Respondent describes as being similar to the present case. The Aven
tribunal stated that “an investor who disposes of ownership of the investment in question before
arbitral proceedings should not be eligible to seek the Treaty’s protection, unless special

2 109

circumstances are present’ According to the Respondent, the special circumstances

contemplated by the Aven tribunal are limited to the involuntary loss of control over the

The Respondent asserts that here, by contrast, the Claimant voluntarily sold its shares in Alcor
CZ, its indirect investment in the Plots, on 24 February 2016, more than two years prior to filing

the Notice of Arbitration.!"!

The Respondent acknowledges'!”

that the position might be different if the Claimant had already
suffered harm as a result of a violation of the Treaty prior to its divestment but maintains that
since “no actionable claim ... had arisen at the time of sale, none was carved out to be retained
by Claimant.”

The Respondent concludes that, as the Claimant sold its Plots prior to initiating this arbitration,
voluntarily and without any sign of duress, this Tribunal should reject the claim for lack of

jurisdiction.''*

With respect to the Claimant’s intention to “sell the investment ... while preserving claims against
the [Respondent],” the Respondent objects that the Claimant’s subjective intent to preserve its
Treaty claims is irrelevant.''> The alleged harm underlying the Claimant’s Treaty claims is the
City’s failure to enter into a lease with Alcor CZ and to pay compensation for unjust enrichment
at the Resolution No. 2141 rate. According to the Respondent, “the ‘harm’ of which Claimant
complains—and that is asserted as a supposed breach of the Republic’s ‘fair and equitable
treatment’ duties—is being (and has been) addressed in the Czech courts,” while the Claimant

“voluntarily divested its shares before the District Court ruled in Alcor CZ’s favor.”!!®

The Claimant's Position'"’

As a threshold matter, the Claimant argues that the jurisdictional objections raised by the
Respondent in the Statement of Defence were brought belatedly, and that they “should have been
made prior to service of the Statement of Defence.”!'*

The Claimant argues that it qualified as an investor under the Treaty when it established Alcor
CZ, and that the Treaty neither implicitly nor explicitly suggests that by selling its assets, the
Claimant would lose its position as an investor.'!? According to the Claimant, “[b]y virtue of the
sale of the plots the present right of action vests in the Claimant as the former owner of 99% of

the shares in Alcor Holdings CZ.”!?

The Claimant argues that Article 9(1) of the Treaty “does not link the possibility of dispute
resolution to title to the investment.”'?! In the Claimant's view, “an investment dispute may arise
when an investor no longer has title to an investment itself.!??_ It maintains that there is no
requirement in Article 9 of the Treaty that a party initiating arbitration must be an investor at the
time of the Notice of Arbitration and contends:
. It would be illogical to impose a condition of continuing ownership of the investment.
The Respondent presupposes without explaining or justifying that an investor loses his right

illogical to the point of absurdity,
In this situation, the investor

    

 
  

is no longer interested in being present in the given contracting state and is trying to sell the
investment (or its remaining part) while preserving claims against the given contracting
state. '?3
The Claimant denies that the authorities invoked by the Respondent support the conclusion that a
claimant must be an investor at the time that it commences arbitration proceedings.'™* According
to the Claimant, the passage which the Respondent quoted from Aven was taken out of context
and the real issue in that case was whether the property in question had ever been owned by the

claimant.'> Loewen was a difficult case which turned on diversity of nationality rather than a

change in title.'°° The material part of the Daimler award, according to the Claimant, makes clear
that “there is no connection between the continued ownership of the asset and the right to bring
proceedings”.'?7

The Claimant denies that there have to be “special reasons” for a divestment prior to the bringing
of arbitration proceedings but contends that, even if that were the case, that requirement is
satisfied because, based on the testimony of Mr “by virtue of the length of time that
had been taken, the Claimant was pushed into a position where liquidation of the asset was
necessary”. !?°

The Claimant contends that it had already suffered harm at the time that it sold its holding in
Alcor CZ, because the treatment by the City of Alcor CZ’s claim to compensation for unjust
enrichment amounted to a violation of the legitimate expectations which the Claimant had
possessed at the time it acquired its investment and was thus a denial of the duty to accord fair
and equitable treatment. As the point is put in the Claimant’s PHB, “[t]he damage suffered by
the Claimant occurred over an ongoing period commencing at or about the time the Claimant
attempted to get representatives of Prague to engage with him in negotiation”.'*°

Finally, the Claimant points to the fact that it had reserved ownership of any Treaty claim in the

sale to Mizar (see para. II.2 of the Sale Agreement, quoted above at para. 115).'"!

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s sole purpose in establishing Alcor CZ was to
“purchase the Plots at a below-market rate and then sue the City.”"** The Respondent contends
that the Claimant and Mr i have admitted to having this motivation in mind when
establishing Alcor CZ.'5

Relying on the decision in Romak v. Uzbekistan, the Respondent contends that the term
“investment” should be interpreted in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty, which is the
“stimulation of business initiative” and to “increase prosperity in both Contracting States.”'*°
Relying on the Romak judgment, the Respondent argues that a covered investment requires a

“contribution” of resources to a host State’s economy over a period of time as well as risk.'*”

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s investment carried no element of risk.'** At best, the

made no tax filings in the Czech Republic, and had no record of written communications with the
142

Claimant.
Given the stated purpose of the Treaty to “increase prosperity in both Contracting States,” the
Respondent points to wi allegedly “express admission [that] he had no intention of

143

developing business in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, the Respondent contends that

“TaJny attempt to obtain compensation from the host state in excess of the monies invested therein
cannot by definition constitute contribution to that state’s economy.”!*

In reply to the Claimant’s assertion that it had not intended to initiate proceedings until it was
forced to do so by Prague’s “inaction”, the Respondent alleges that before buying the Plots, the
Claimant had already learned about the need to bring court proceedings in order to be awarded

unjust enrichment compensation. ">

The Respondent argues that in Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, the tribunal relied on even fewer
indicia than are present here to conclude that the alleged investment was not bona fide.'“° In that
case, the tribunal found that “no economic activity in the market was either performed or even
intended by [the claimant]. No business plan, no program of re-financing, no economic objectives
were ever presented, no real valuation of the economic transactions were ever attempted ...
giv[ing] strong credit to the understanding of the [t]ribunal, according to which the whole
operation was not an economic investment.”!”

In the present case, according to the Respondent, Alcor CZ was nothing but a “conduit by which
Mr. i instructed counsel to manage his claims against the City,” with an eye towards
earning a “windfall return”. 48 As a result, the Claimant’s establishment of Alcor CZ does not

qualify as an investment, and the Tribunal should dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction.'”

The Claimant's Position’

The Claimant submits that its investment in the Plots is protected within the meaning of Article
1(1)(b) of the Treaty, reasoning that “[s]elf-evidently [the] purchase of a share in a company
established under the laws of one of the contracting parties to a bilateral investment treaty is an

v151

‘Investment’ pursuant to such a treaty.

The Claimant urges the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent’s submissions about the motives

underlying its acquisition of the Plots as “tendentious and fanciful speculation.”

The Claimant denies the assertion that its land purchases were made at a “below-market rate”.'°>

Instead, it characterizes the purchase as being driven by “standard, rational economic reasoning
covering the wish of the landowner not to suffer losses from the future sale of the Plots.”!**

In respect of the Respondent’s emphasis on the object and purpose of the Treaty, the Claimant
contends that the preamble of the Treaty includes additional provisions concerning the “desir[e]
to create favourable conditions ... particularly for investments by investors of one Contracting

State in the territory of the other Contracting State.”!**

Only if such conditions protective to
investors were in place, would the Treaty “be conducive to the stimulation of business initiative
and increase prosperity in both Contracting States.”'*° According to the Claimant, the Respondent
did not fulfil this requirement.'*”

The Claimant argues that this Tribunal should only consider the Treaty’s definition of investment,
and disregard decisions of other tribunals quoted out of context or involving unrelated facts, such
as the Romak award cited by the Respondent. The Claimant submits that the factual background
in Romak involved a different industry (grain) and a different substantive dispute (payment
problems), and that the Respondent quoted parts of the decision out of context.'** Nevertheless,
the Claimant implies that the Romak criteria (of a contribution over a period of time and risk)

were satisfied by its putative investment. By the purchase of the Plots, the Claimant asserts, it

mischaracterizing Mr | | witness statement in “suggesting that the project entailed
absolutely no risk and that cr] admitted that he did not intend to develop his business
activities in the Czech Republic at all.”'® In clarification the Claimant refers to wi
oral evidence that he considered the Plots to be significantly undervalued, presenting a “very low
risk of decreasing in value, and with a substantial value over time opportunity” independent of

the expected rental yield.'*!

  

The Claimant also rejects the allegation that its investment was no more than an “acquisition of a

 

lawsuit.”' The Claimant argues that when it acquired its investment, it never planned t ate

proceedings either under the Treaty against the Czech Republic or in Czech Courts against the

City, and that the present arbitration is only a result of the City’s unlawful conduct.'®*

a Foreseeable Dispute

The Respondent’s Position'®*

The Respondent objects to the admissibility of the Claimant’s claims on the grounds that they

constitute an abuse of process. '°*

The Respondent submits that the “entire rationale” behind ui structuring his acquisitions
of the Plots in 2010 and 2011 through the Claimant, a UAE-incorporated entity, was to create
jurisdiction over a dispute under the Treaty that was not only foreseeable, but the “entire business
plan” at the time of the acquisitions.'®° In response to the Claimant’s contention that “the center
of Mr economic activity is based in Dubai,” the Respondent objects that, “by his own

and remained there until 2013,” leaving “no valid reason for Claimant to invest through the
UAE."!97

In particular, the Respondent submits that “the initiation of a treaty-based investor-State
arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights (or an abuse of process, the rights abused being
procedural in nature) when an investor has changed its corporate structure to gain the protection
of an investment treaty at a point in time when a specific dispute was foreseeable.” A dispute
is “foreseeable” if the Claimant “can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute
as a very high probability.”!

The Respondent relies on the Phoenix Action case, in which a Czech national incorporated an
Israeli holding company that then purchased two Czech companies previously owned directly by
the Czech national.” The Tribunal in that case found the Israeli claimant’s claims under the
Czech Republic-Israel BIT inadmissible as an abuse of right because “Claimant made an
‘investment’ not for the purpose of engaging in economic activity, but for the sole purpose of

bringing international litigation against the Czech Republic.”!”!

By analogy to Phoenix Action, the Respondent suggests that ui structured his purchase
of the Plots through the Claimant to avail himself of an international forum for claims he sought

to bring against the Respondent and that would not otherwise have been available to ui
as a Czech citizen.'” The Respondent therefore urges this Tribunal to rule that ui

acquisition of the Plots through the Claimant was a “domestic investment disguised as an

international investment for the sole purpose of access to” investment treaty arbitration.'*

The Claimant's Position'™

The Claimant suggests that ui “evaluated the planned investment opportunity as low-
risk” and “did not assume that Prague would act in breach of the law” by failing to pay

compensation for unjust enrichment in accordance with the Resolution No. 2141 rate.'°

The Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s reliance on Phoenix Action as mistaken; the Claimant
suggests that it is “particularly obvious” that the Respondent “misinterprets certain conclusions
of [the Phoenix Action tribunal]”.'”° While the Claimant does not explain which conclusions are
misinterpreted by the Respondent, it suggests that the facts are inapposite.'” The Phoenix Action
case involved a Czech citizen, VV whose Czech companies had been parties to
proceedings before Czech courts. Mii allegedly escaped from custody in the Czech Republic
and founded the claimant company Phoenix Action Ltd in Israel. Phoenix Action then acquired
stakes in the ui Czech companies—which had been held by Mr wife in the
interim—three months before notifying the Czech Republic of an investment dispute. By
contrast, according to the Claimant, ur has resided and worked in Dubai since 2006 and
only obtained a Czech passport in 2018 on account of being the child of Czechoslovakian parents
who had emigrated in 1969. The Claimant submits that it is therefore “logical” to have undertaken

the acquisition of the Plots through a UAE-incorporated entity.!7

The Claimant also refutes the application of Philip Morris as inapposite to the facts of its claim.
Whereas the claimant in Philip Morris undertook a corporate restructure in order to gain treaty
protection after its cause of action had accrued, in the present case there was no corporate
restructuring after the acts on which the claim is based.'” The Claimant refers in this regard to
the fact that Alcor CZ commenced the domestic proceedings against the City shortly after

acquisition of the last of the plots.'*”

The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s contention that at the time ui conducted due
diligence prior to acquiring the Plots, he must have foreseen that he would have to bring a claim
in court to recover compensation for unjust enrichment. The Claimant notes that although the
due diligence “includes a description of a situation in which such a landowner initiated court
proceedings, ... [i]t was not possible to foresee that Prague would act in the same way” in the
instant case. Rather, the Claimant argues, its “reasonable expectation” was that the City would

“enter negotiations [leading to] a satisfactory outcome”. !*!

4, Whether the C laimant Se eks “ Supranational” R eview of the J udgments o f C zech
Courts

The Respondent's Position'**

The Respondent characterizes the Claimant’s Treaty claims as a “supranational” avenue for
appealing the decisions of the Czech courts.'** The Respondent alleges that this is an “abuse of

process” that justifies ruling the Claimants’ claim inadmissible.

The Respondent relies on the Apotex tribunal’s explanation that “it is not the proper role of an
international tribunal ... to substitute itself for the [host state’s] Supreme Court, or to act as a
supranational appellate court,” to make its case that such a “supranational” appeal constitutes an

abuse of process. '**

Notwithstanding the Claimant’s assertion that its claims under the Treaty are “different” from
Alcor CZ’s claims in the Czech courts, the Respondent objects that the “Claimant’s alleged harm
that is integral to each of the three Treaty breaches is the same purported harm asserted by Alcor
CZ in the [Czech domestic litigation].”'*> Specifically, the harm asserted by the Claimant is that
it “expected payment of rent (after entering into a lease agreement) and/or compensation for

unjust enrichment in the statutory amount [i.e., the Resolution No. 2141 rate]” but did not receive

The Claimant’s Position'**

The Claimant draws a distinction in legal personality between itself and Alcor CZ and highlights
the distinct legal grounds for the claims brought by each company.'*? The Claimant’s position is
that it could not be seeking to review decisions of the Czech courts since “the Claimant has never
been a party to a dispute before Czech courts.”!"” The Claimant submits that all its claims arise
under the Treaty, unlike the Czech law claims of Alcor CZ that were litigated in Czech courts. '"!
At the same time, the Claimant submits that “[s]ince Prague has consistently rejected and
continues to reject the claim of Alcor Holdings CZ, contrary to the provisions of Czech law, and
insists that Alcor Holdings CZ is not entitled to anything, which fact leads to the Claimant’s
Investment not being protected by the law and the inability of the Claimant to collect its
entitlement, the Claimant now makes the corresponding claim under international law for an

unprotected investment directly against the Respondent pursuant to the Treaty.”'?

While recognizing that the same underlying harm can entitle a claimant to claims under both
domestic law and the Treaty, the Respondent emphasizes that this should not entitle the Claimant
to double recovery for the same harm.'°5

The Respondent draws attention to the fact that the Claimant retained the right to bring the instant
Treaty claims while selling the right to recovery from the Czech courts to Mizar (which the
Respondent alleges is “closely related” to the Claimant and MD. and invites the Tribunal
to make the “adverse inference that the sale was a transfer of convenience intended to enable
Claimant or Me to keep an interest in the monies Alcor CZ would receive from the City

.., while simultaneously pursuing this arbitration. In support, the Respondent adduces

several observations:

(a) _ that the Claimant sold its shares in Alcor CZ at a lower price than it had been offered by

Prague or the original purchase price of the Plots, contrary to “business sense”;

(b) that the Claimant did not produce documentation attesting to the reasons for its sale of

shares in Alcor CZ, in spite of the Tribunal’s request that it do so; and

(c) the absence of any testimony or documents disclaiming the Respondent’s assertion of a
“likely identity of interest” between the Claimant and Mizar, and the resulting implication

that the sale of its Alcor CZ shareholding was not an arms-length transaction. '°”

The Respondent suggests that the Claimant has therefore not produced evidence rebutting
Respondent's prima facie showing that the transaction with Mizar was not a bona fide transaction,
which in the Respondent’s submission places a heretofore unmet burden upon the Claimant to

show that the transaction was bona fide.'°*

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’ s downplaying of its initial recovery through litigation
in the Czech courts “demonstrates bad faith that necessitates dismissal of all claims as

inadmissible.” '

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant accuses the Respondent of failing to distinguish between the subject matter of the
Czech civil law litigation involving Alcor CZ and the Treaty claims raised by the Claimant, Alcor

CZ’s former parent, in the instant arbitration.?°!

The Claimant underscores that the City’s
settlement with Alcor CZ is “different from the present claim” because the former claim arose
under Czech civil law and in favour of Alcor CZ against Prague rather than under the Treaty in
favour of the Claimant against the Respondent. The Claimant also recalls that it ceased to be a
shareholder of Alcor CZ as a result of the share transfer agreement signed in November 2015 and
delivered to Alcor CZ in February 2016.” As a result, the Claimant argues that it “did not receive
any compensation from [the City] in the form of compensation for unjust enrichment or any other
monetary benefit,””"’ leaving “arbitration on the basis of the Treaty [as] the only way in which

the Claimant might have claimed its rights and protected its investment.”?"*

The Claimant asserts that the sale of its shares in Alcor CZ was a genuine transaction.”°° It refers
in this regard to the oral testimony of ui in evidence that the Director of Mizar was a

colleague of his.?°°

At the heart of the Claimant’s case, as set out in its Statement of Claim, lies the theory that
Resolution No. 2141, although directly concerned with the compensation to be paid fo the City
by any third party which had erected or maintained a structure on land owned by the City, was
also determinative of the amount of compensation to be paid from the City in a case in which the
City erected or maintained structures such as roads or other utilities on land owned by a private
party. That conclusion is set to follow from the fact that Resolution No. 2141 should be taken as

setting the “market rate”. As the Claimant puts it in the Statement of Claim:

 

According to the principles of equality and justice Regulation 2141 (as it creates the market
price customary in place and time) is also directly applicable to the compensation for total
occupation of land by building, communications and infrastructure. Any other interpretation
would be contradictory to the principles of the Treaty (particularly Article 3 of the treaty —
National and Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment).7°°

2. Fair and Equitable Treatment and Legitimate Expectations

The Claimant’s Position”

The Claimant argues that it had a legitimate expectation that Prague would enter into a lease with
the Claimant and pay “an adequate price (rent) for the use of its property” or, in the alternative,
that the City would compensate Alcor CZ for unjust enrichment in an amount consistent with
Resolution No. 2141.2!° The Claimant submits that the “correctness of [its] conclusions” was
“reaffirmed” when

negotiations/correspondence with Prague revealed that ... (i) Prague itself enters into lease

agreements in similar situations, (ii) where no lease agreement is concluded, Prague brings

an action for the recovery of unjust enrichment, and (iii) proceeds in both ca

its own regulation, whereas the price is always the same regardless of whether it is a rent or
an unjust enrichment.*!!

 

The Claimant argues that its legitimate expectations were frustrated when it received neither “rent
(after entering into a lease agreement) and/or compensation for unjust enrichment in the statutory

amount ... to be determined by Prague pursuant to Resolution 2141.”?!? Instead, “contrary to the

Claimant’s legitimate expectation ... the revenue of the Claimant was zero by reason of Prague’s

breach of its obligations.
The Claimant alleges that its legitimate expectations were first frustrated when a lease was not
concluded “due to the failure or refusal of Prague to comply with its obligations.”?"* The Claimant
challenges the Respondent’s assertions that Prague does not routinely enter into lease agreements
for land underlying public roads, and that Resolution No. 2141 is related to short-term leases.?!>
The Claimant points to the absence of any mention of the short-term nature of leases in Resolution
No. 2141 and the accompanying legislative decision; on the contrary, the Claimant asserts, the
clear wording of Resolution No. 2141 “presumes long-term leases that in total covers the time
period of the investment.”?!®

The Claimant then argues that its legitimate expectations were further violated when it was not
paid compensation for unjust enrichment at the Resolution No. 2141 rate, which according to the
Claimant, establishes the market rental rate that would have been applicable to the Claimant’s
lands. The Claimant submits that because the City has title to almost 99% of the land on which
its roads are built, the City has a de facto monopoly in the relevant market and that consequently
Resolution No. 2141 sets the market price “for which similar lands are to be leased.”?'’ The
Claimant further submits that under Czech law, the amount of lost income for purposes of
calculating unjust enrichment is pegged to the rent that is customary at a given time and place.?!*
The Claimant therefore contends that it is entitled to the Resolution No. 2141 rate as the rent

“common at the place and at the time given.”?"?

Resolution No. 2141 rate is applicable not only to land owned by the City, but also to its lands.
The Claimant calculates “the amount of the requested lost income (unjust enrichment) owed to
it” under the Resolution No. 2141 rate.?? In particular, the Claimant relies on the rate of CZK
10/m?/day set forth in section 2.F of Resolution No. 2141 for “the rent of land for the purposes of
construction activities with or without impact on the communications”.?** The Claimant asserts
that this rate is applicable regardless of whether a lease contract was concluded between the
Claimant and the City.”° Further, the Claimant notes by reference to a number of notarial deeds

that “Prague itself considers the [Resolution No. 2141 rate] as usual”.?26

The Claimant argues that “the [MoF Assessment] would never have applied in the case of the
Plots.””” According to the Claimant, the MoF Assessment “does not determine a maximum
amount of compensation for unjust enrichment as this does not apply in the case of use of the
[Plots]. The [MoF Assessments] are not applicable to commercial leases. It is indisputable that
for citizens of the Czech Republic ... [the communications infrastructure upon the Plots] are used
consistently ... in high volume for business purposes. In addition this confers a benefit to the
public.”?**

The Claimant maintains that it was entitled to “equal treatment” and contends that the City “while
in the position of landlord leases the lands for a high rent but ... while in the position of user does

not want to pay anything.”?*°

To the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant failed to conduct “the most basic due

9231

diligence, the Claimant objects that the Respondent does not mention “what it is that the

Claimant ought to have done but did not do.”?

The Claimant insists that it “undertook legal due
diligence confirming that the intended revenues were ... due and confirmed by the applicable
laws, case-law and legal practice ... [and] therefore proceeded with the care of a prudent
investor.”?* The Claimant refers to the oral testimony of ui in evidence that he sought
legal input from but “he also took soundings from colleagues, relatives and
business contacts”.?** The Claimant also contends that “the fact that recovery of an amount of
unjust enrichment was governed by principles anticipated in the due diligence iii
was verified by Prague.””** In particular, the Claimant refers to Prague’s letter of 28 February

Claimant asserts that “the Prague officials to whom the Claimant wrote either agreed with the
Claimant’s interpretation or at any rate failed to gainsay the Claimant” and seeks that adverse

inferences be drawn against the Respondent's interpretation.?**

inapposite factual scenarios, did not address the merits or post-dated the Claimant’s investment.?”

In particular the Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s reliance on the Czech Supreme Court’s
decision in Case No. 28 Cdo 2056/2009” to uphold the payment of compensation for unjust
enrichment at the MoF Assessment rate to owners of land on which the City had built roads.”""
The Claimant argues that the cited case is inapposite because it “concerned plots not used for
business purposes, and the Czech Supreme Court did not deal with matters of unjust

99242

enrichment. According to the Claimant, “[i]t can be concluded that the expectations of the

Claimant were not affected by this judgment.”

The Claimant also minimizes the significance of the judgments handed down against Alcor CZ at
all levels of the Czech courts. In the Claimant’s Skeleton, it argues in its December 2019
judgment on Alcor CZ’s appeal from the Second Instance Judgment, the Czech Supreme Court
“declined on procedural grounds to reopen the matter. It was not a decision on the merits.””44 The
Claimant” and its legal experts”° have similarly argued that the 2 June 2020 resolution of the
Czech Constitutional Court had no bearing on the merits of the conduct by Prague of which the
Claimant complains. Drawing on the distinction between unlawful and unconstitutional decisions
by general courts, Professors submit that the Czech Constitutional Court had
only held that Alcor CZ’s petition did not raise questions of a constitutional magnitude, not that
the underlying December 2019 Supreme Court Judgment had correctly decided the merits of

Alcor CZ’s Czech law claims.”

The Respondent's Position™*

The Respondent relies on the standard set out in Tecmed v. Mexico as to when the frustration of

legitimate expectations rises to the level of a breach of a fair and equitable treatment obligation:

[t]he foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity
and totally transparent in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know
beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the
goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its
investment and comply with such regulations.”?

 

 

    

According to the Respondent, to prevail on its legitimate expectations claim, the Claimant would

have to show that:

 

(a) the Republic specifically represented that Claimant would get unjust enrichment
compensation or a lease at the Resolution 2141 Rate; (b) it was reasonable for Claimant to
rely on that representation; (c) Claimant actually relied on that representation; and (d) the
Republic violated that expectation resulting in damage to Claimant.?°

According to the Respondent’s fact witness, a. the Head of Legal Activities at

the City’s Department of Property Management, Prague has “continuously made diligent efforts”

 

to make such property settlements, subject to the paucity and inaccuracy of records identifying
which plots of land still present issues of un-unified title.?*! Dr suggests that “when it had
sufficient information, the [City] was proactively seeking out property settlements on its own
initiative, although its progress was dictated by the City’s finite financial and human resources.
Over time, the number of requests for property settlements rose to such an extent that there was
almost no space for pro-active approach of the [City].”?*

The Respondent asserts that there is no statutory procedure for the consolidation of title.> The
City performs this duty primarily through buyouts or, where this is not possible, through the
purchase of a permanent easement.*™ Failing these options, the City can also exercise eminent

domain and take ownership of public roads, in exchange for compensation under Section 17(2)

of the Road Act.?°> Di emphasizes that an “acquiror of land has no reason to expect that
he will obtain a regular income from the ownership of the land under the road related to the use
of the land by the owner of the road ... without any time limitation.”?°°

The Respondent contends that there was no basis—much less a representation or undertaking on
the City’s part—for the Claimant’s purported expectation at the time of its investment that the
City would enter into leases with the Claimant.’ According to both ; and
a. the City does not have a legal obligation or policy of entering into lease agreements
in this or comparable sectors.?>* | does acknowledge, however, that in “rare cases,”
the City deviates from its general practice to enter into lease agreements.” fT offers
the example of a case in which the City tried and failed to purchase a plot on which a subway line
was planned; the City therefore leased the plot “until such time as the City gains legal ownership
of these plots” and paid rent amounting to the MoF Assessment cap. Emphasizing that such
leases are not entered into “routinely,” notes that the explanatory notes describe
such leases as an “extraordinary, exceptional, specific and above all a temporary solution.”?*!
According to the Respondent, rather than relying on representations made by the Respondent, the
Claimant relied solely on “Mr. own self-serving and incorrect interpretation of Czech

law."

The Respondent asserts that “any serious due diligence” would have revealed the
Claimants’ expectations to be baseless in law and fact and “patently unreasonable” in light of
Czech case law.”°> The Respondent suggests that “the City would never enter a lease on the terms
Alcor CZ sought ... because it would contravene its duty to act in the public interest and find a

permanent solution to unify title.”?** The Respondent emphasizes that “the City has deviated

private entity, the City “always [makes] efforts for property settlement through a permanent legal
solution.””°° Because the possibility of lease termination may reinstate the need to compensate
landowners, suggests that a policy of entering leases “contradicts both the character
of roadway constructions and public interest.”?°7

According to the Respondent, at the time the Claimant acquired the Plots, the City would have
either agreed to a “permanent solution” (buyout or creation of an easement) or invoked section
17(2) of the Road Act, under which the City could request a public administrative body to order
the creation of an easement with commensurate compensation.” Although the Respondent does
not contest that unjust enrichment is owed and routinely paid to owners of land occupied by public

roads,”

the Respondent emphasizes that

Claimant’s own legal authorities show that in 2009, that is before Claimant's purchases of
Plots commenced in January 2010, the Czech Supreme Court had upheld the City’s refusal
to enforce leases for the construction of roads on plots with un-unified title, and instead ruled
that the City’s use of land was subject to compensation for unjust enrichment at the MoF
Assessment.?”°

 

The Respondent similarly contends that there was no reason for the Claimant to expect that the
Resolution No. 2141 rate would apply to any compensation paid to the Claimant.””' According
to the Respondent, Czech law has consistently held that compensation for unjust enrichment is
based on an appraisal of prevailing rent for comparable land, capped by the applicable MoF

Assessment rate.?”?

Relying on the witness statements of fact witness ; and its expert witness
| the Respondent emphasizes that Resolution No. 2141 only applies to “rental by the
City of Prague of public roads for temporary purposes,” and that it only applies to employees and
subsidiary organizations of the City, but does not create “third-party rights.”*”> The Respondent
alleges that the Claimant should have known at the time of its acquisition of the Plots that
compensation was governed by the MoF Assessment and not Resolution No. 2141, which “on its
face ... solely applies to short term leases for property owned by the City, when the lessee uses

the City’s land for construction purposes.”?”*

| submits that Section 2.F of Resolution No. 2141, upon which the Claimant relies,
applies to the short-term lease of roadways and only where: (a) the roadway is owned by the City;
(b) the underlying land is also owned by the City; (c) the lease is temporary.’”> YY also
comes to the same conclusion that Resolution No. 2141 “governs an entirely distinct set of
circumstances, namely the rental by Prague of public roads (or parts of them) for temporary
purposes”.?”° The Czech Municipal Court also took a similar position distinguishing the Plots, as
“plots of land built up with roads”, from the leases to which Resolution No. 2141 applies, namely

“short-term leases for building activity on the road or loans of roads for purposes.”?””

According vo no private party has ever asserted a claim in a Czech court for unjust

enrichment at the rate laid out in Resolution No. 2141.7”

The Respondent also submits that the District Court, Municipal Court, and Czech Supreme Court
have all held that Resolution No. 2141 only sets out Prague’s “pricing policy for plots of land that
are owned by it and are leased to a particular entity for a particular purpose of use” and is therefore
inapplicable to the calculation of compensation for unjust enrichment owed to the Claimant,
which “must be determined by an expert opinion as a price of the rent common in a given locality

of the Czech Constitutional Court does not speak to the merits of Alcor CZ’s claim, the
Respondent”*’ and its expert witness | argue that the Constitutional Court

“reviewed the merits of, and rejected, Alcor CZ’s constitutional complaint in its entirety.”

Furthermore, the Respondent argues, the case law cited by the Claimant does not support the
application of the Resolution No. 2141 rate to determine unjust enrichment compensation, while
Czech Supreme Court precedent supports the application of the MoF Assessment cap instead.?*?
The Respondent also rejects the notarial deeds upon which the Claimant purports to have based
its expectation that the Resolution No. 2141 rate would apply by pointing out that the deeds “all
postdate the investment ... [and] all describe property owned, not leased, by the City.”?8*

The Respondent adds that at the time of the Claimant’s acquisition of the Plots, there was ongoing
litigation in Czech courts over whether “speculators” were entitled to any compensation."
Although ultimately those claims have been resolved against the state, with the courts finding that
the alleged “speculators” might be entitled to compensation, the Respondent takes the position
that the Claimant should have inferred from the litigation ongoing at the time of its alleged
investment that it “could not have had a reasonable expectation of an entitlement to any
compensation, let alone the exaggerated compensation” pursuant to the Resolution No. 2141 rate
sought by the Claimant.?*

The Respondent asserts that had the Claimant undertaken due diligence that was more than
“perfunctory”, it would have known that its interpretation of Czech law was untenable.”** The

| Memo,” and submits that it “fails any version of the ‘prudent investor’ test.”**” The
Respondent emphasizes that the duty to investigate all material factors, including the applicable
requirements of Czech local law, was incumbent upon the Claimant and that the Treaty does not
insure against bad business judgments undertaken without meeting that duty.*** Foreign investors
are bound to take the law in the host state as they find it at the time of the investment, and
investment tribunals have either refused to exercise jurisdiction or denied claims premised on
interpretations of host state law contrary to the applicable law.”*” The Respondent also submits
that ignorance of the law, or acting on the basis of “deficient” legal advice provided by

The Respondent also observes that the Memo itself fails to cite any instances in which
the City entered into a lease with a private party at the Resolution No. 2141 rate.°! Moreover,

3. Arbitrary or Bad Faith Conduct
The Claimant’s Position®*

The Claimant submits that the City has acted “in bad faith and in an arbitrary way” in breach of
Article 2(3) of the Treaty because it “refused and still refuses to pay compensation for unjust
enrichment on a consistent basis.”?°*

The Claimant suggests that Alcor CZ sought to negotiate with the City (admittedly, “in [an]
informal way”) but that such negotiations “did not lead to any outcome during the five years while
the Claimant’ s Investment Protection lasted.”°> The Claimant adds that “Prague failed or refused
to pay the owed rent or unjust enrichment either on the basis asserted by the Claimant or at all.”?°°
According to the Claimant, the “stance of Prague ... can be characterized as lacking good faith
and arbitrary.”?"” The Claimant explains that this is “obvious, in particular considering the fact
that Prague refused and still refuses to pay compensation for unjust enrichment on a consistent

basis.”?°

According to the Claimant:

Prague waited until individual landowners brought their claims and let them sue without
paying them at least unjust enrichment in the amount that was determined by it as
undisputable. Therefore, it is not surprising that some landowners, including Alcor Holdings
CZ, did not want to undergo lengthy negotiations with Prague and advanced their valid claims
before the courts.”

 

 

Additionally the Claimant asserts that the way in which it has been treated by the Czech

authorities, including by the courts, has been “inherently unfair and unreasonable”.*”

issue is “obviously tied to the larger issue of whether Prague acted in accordance with the Czech

99303

law applicable to owners of Plots such as the Claimant. Any charge of arbitrariness is

qualified by the fact that the “the City did not diverge in any way from the law or its standard
policy and practice when interacting with [the] Claimant.”*™*

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s contention that the City refused to negotiate, pointing to
evidence that “Alcor CZ sued the City without having even approached the City to find an out-
of-court resolution of its claim.”°° The Respondent submits that the Claimant's intent never to
hold meaningful negotiations is evidenced by the fact that only ten days after completing its
acquisition of the Plots the Claimant brought suit in the District Court.*°°

Moreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s former subsidiary Alcor CZ “fully
participated” in the Czech domestic litigation, that Czech courts found that Alcor CZ was entitled
to compensation from the City consistent with the MoF Assessments, and that such compensation
was duly paid.” According to the Respondent, “the Czech courts have applied Czech law
consistently and predictably”, making any allegation of a lack of due process unsustainable. *°*
4, Full Protection and Security

The Claimant’s Position*”

The Claimant submits that its investments did not enjoy “protection to a degree consistent with
international law,” as required under Article 2(2) of the Treaty." The Claimant argues that the
Respondent's obligation to protect investments under Article 2(2) covers the “possibility to realise

1

returns,” which the Claimant was not allowed to realise.*!' The Claimant has accepted that its

equitable treatment claim would necessarily determine its full protection and security claim.*"*

The Respondent’s Position*"*

The Respondent interprets Article 2(2) to be a full protection and security obligation.*!°

The Respondent submits that a full protection and security obligation is generally only breached
when a state “fails to protect an investor’s property from actual, physical, damage,” which the

Claimant has not alleged in this case.*"°

To the extent the Claimant invokes an obligation under Article 2(2) to protect “the possibility to
realise returns,” the Respondent concedes that such an obligation exists, but stresses that “the

317

Treaty does not guarantee returns or profitability”’’’ and objects to the Claimant’s suggestion that

the Respondent “should be put to strict proof that Claimant made a return of its investment.”*!*
According to the Respondent, it is sufficient that “there is no evidence of any interference with

the Claimant’s enjoyment of its investment, including its returns.”>"°

State.

    

The Claimant’s Position*”®

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent breached its obligation to accord investors national and
most-favoured nation treatment under Article 3 of the Treaty because the City “did not pay any
compensation for unjust enrichment (of any amount) for using of the Plots as it was obliged to do
so by law.”*?! In the Claimant’s Skeleton, the Claimant clarifies that under its interpretation of
Article 3, “all that this provision does is require that the Respondent should conduct its dealings
with parties in the position of the Claimant in accordance with the law prevailing in the
Contracting State at the relevant time.”*”? According to the Claimant, to demonstrate a breach of
Article 3, “[t]here is no obligation on the Claimant to show that its treatment was less favourable

99323

than any third party. Even if, arguendo, such an obligation were incumbent upon it, the
Claimant argues that the Respondent would be “obliged to treat the Claimant no less favourably
than its own investors ... include[ing] the Respondent itself .... The Claimant should therefore be

treated in the same manner as the Respondent would treat itself.”

The Claimant submits further that, vis-a-vis the City (“a Czech state agency”), it has been treated
in a way which was “significantly less favourable”. > According to the Claimant, it is unfair and
discriminatory for the City to “charge rent to somebody else for using its land at one rate but pay
another much lower rent when it has used the land of a private owner (in this case a foreign
investor)”.*”° According to the Claimant, no compensation awarded to its former subsidiary Alcor
CZ in Czech courts “is applicable in the present case” given that the Claimant’s asserted
entitlement in this case arises under international law pursuant to the Treaty and that the Czech
Supreme Court “has determined the amount of unjust enrichment as the common price at the

given place and time.”*”

The Claimant asserts additionally that it was treated unfairly by the Czech courts pursuant to the
decisions of the District and Municipal Courts, which went uncorrected on appeal. According to
the Claimant, the Czech Courts failed to administer justice in their treatment of the claims raised
by Alcor CZ insofar as they uncritically accepted the outcome of the Equity Solutions report

(establishing the market price for the rent of the Plots).>7*

The Respondent's Position*”

The Respondent submits that the Claimant “misapprehends the scope of the [Article 3] duty,”
which is breached only if the Claimant establishes “it received less favourable treatment as
compared to another investor (whether foreign or national) and that there are no reasons that could

justify any proven disparate treatment.”**°

The Respondent highlights that the “Claimant has not identified any other analogous investor who

received any different, let alone less favourable treatment.”**!

For that reason, the Respondent characterizes the Claimant’s Article 3 claim as “indecipherable”,
and baseless to the extent it is premised on the Claimant seeking compensation at the Resolution
No. 2141 rate.** In any event, the Respondent adds that “only Alcor CZ ... is eligible for
compensation” and that if the Claimant had retained ownership of its Alcor CZ shares, “it would

have indirectly made a healthy profit.”

The Claimant has indicated, however, that it would “give credit against sums which Alcor CZ has

recovered in proceedings before the Czech Courts.”*°

The Claimant suggests that the City was unjustly enriched in the amount of the “usual rent

collected by Prague for leasing its own plots of land [i.e., the Resolution No. 2141 rate].”°°°
In response to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant had profited instead of suffering
actual damages, the Claimant also denies that it “gained a return from the sale of its share” in

Alcor CZ.*%”

The Respondent’s Position***

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has “failed to satisfy its burden of proving its purported

99339 7340

damages”*”” and has “shown no entitlement to any damages at al.

First, the Respondent argues that the Claimant did not suffer any actual damages, as it actually
made a profit from the sale of the Plots. The Claimant purchased the Plots for CZK 25,702,310
(US$ 1,117,000), but when it sold the Plots, it received US$ 1,000,000 (approximately CZK
24,566,297), transferred loan obligations related to the purchase of the Plots in the sale of its
shares in Alcor CZ, and received CZK 13,577,363.86 (approximately US$ 450,000) in unjust

enrichment payments from the City.*"!

Secondly, the Respondent argues that, to the extent that the Claimant suffered any harm (quod
non), the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that any damages suffered were caused by a breach
of the Treaty. The Respondent takes the position that even if the Claimant could show that it has
suffered damages, it has not shown that those damages were caused by an alleged breach of the

Treaty.*” Instead, the Respondent submits that any such damages relate to alleged breaches of

Czech law, and are therefore compensable before Czech courts, as evidenced by the domestic

litigation being pursued by Alcor CZ.**

Thirdly, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not met its duty to mitigate damages.
Specifically, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant aggravated the alleged harm by selling its
shares in Alcor CZ before the District Court had rendered judgment. The Respondent contends
that “[hJad [the] Claimant retained its shares, [the] Claimant would have received, through Alcor
CZ, not only the CZK 13,577,363 (approximately US$ 450,000) that the District Court awarded
for historical unjust enrichment, but also the possibility to accept the City’s offer of CZK
32,288,000 (approximately US$ 1.4 million) to buy the plots or CZK 8,070,980 (approximately
US$ 350,000) for an easement.”*“*

Fourthly, the Respondent raises concerns about a potential double recovery, as it does in its
jurisdictional objections. The Respondent argues that any award for damages in the instant
arbitration “would either be duplicative of, or must be offset by, the judgment already paid by the

City” in accordance with the Second Instance Judgment.*“°

Finally, if this Tribunal were to award damages, the Respondent submits that even if the
appropriate measure of compensation for unjust enrichment under Czech law is the Resolution
No. 2141 rate, this would have “no bearing on calculation of damages for a Treaty breach.”"° In
particular, the lost value of the Claimant’s alleged investment is different from the compensation
for unjust enrichment Alcor CZ claims under Czech law.’ For the purposes of this argument,
the Respondent characterizes the relevant investment as “the acquisition of a lawsuit against the
City,” meaning that any lost value [under the Claimant’s damages theory, the difference between
the Resolution No. 2141 rate and the compensation paid pursuant to the Second Instance
Judgment] would have to be discounted for the costs of litigation and the risk of losing the Czech

domestic litigation.*

THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
INTRODUCTION

The Respondent having challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, it is necessary to begin by
addressing that challenge. Article 21(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[t]he
arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction”. That provision

states the general principle of “compé de la é ” or “k -h ” which

 

is applicable before international arbitral tribunals.

Although Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[iJn general, the arbitral tribunal
should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question”, it goes on to provide
that “the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and rule on such a plea in their final

award”. That was the course followed, with the agreement of both Parties, in the present case.

Nevertheless, it is both logical and necessary that the Tribunal addresses the question of its
jurisdiction at the outset of the Award since, if it upholds a complete challenge, then it follows

that it has no jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case.

The Respondent first advanced its objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in its Statement
of Defence filed on 29 March 2019.**! In the Reply, the Claimant maintains that these objections

were advanced too late and should have been put forward at an earlier stage of the proceedings.**?

The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant’s argument that the objections were not advanced
in a sufficiently timely fashion. Article 21(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules provides:

A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the
statement of defence or, with respect to a counter-claim, in the reply to the counter-claim.

The Tribunal considers this provision to be completely clear. A respondent is obliged to raise its
jurisdictional objections no later than the statement of defence. That is perfectly logical since it
may not be until the respondent has seen the claimant’s statement of claim that it will be in a
position to formulate its jurisdictional objections. There is nothing in the rule to suggest any
requirement that a respondent should submit its jurisdictional objections in advance of the

statement of defence.

The Tribunal also notes that, in the present case, Annex | to Procedural Order No. 1, which set

out the pleading schedule and was adopted with the consent of both Parties, expressly provided

Page 61 of 78

for the submission on 29 March 2019 of “Respondent’s Statement of Defence/Counter-Memorial,
including any objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and/or counterclaim” (emphasis added).
The Claimant was therefore on notice from a very early stage that jurisdictional objections might

be made in the Statement of Defence.

The Claimant’s objection that the Respondent did not raise its jurisdictional challenge at an early

enough date is therefore rejected.

One other preliminary matter needs to be considered. The Claimant in the present case is Alcor
Holdings Limited of the UAE (referred to throughout this Award as “Alcor”). On several
occasions, *** counsel for Alcor suggests, in connection with the jurisdiction arguments, that the
Respondent ignores the distinction between Alcor, Alcor CZ (the Czech company which was,
until February 2016, owned by Alcor) and vr who was the owner and, for all practical

purposes, the directing mind of Alcor.*™*

The Claimant is, of course, quite right to highlight the difference between the three actors. It is
indeed Alcor which is the Claimant and whose rights under the Treaty are said to have been
violated. Alcor CZ, on the other hand, was the owner of the Plots and the party to the litigation
in the Czech courts. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind the reality of the corporate
arrangements. Mr owned 99% of the shares in Alcor and directed its activities. He was
clear in his testimony that he had created Alcor as a special purpose vehicle solely for the
investment in the Czech Republic which was to be held by Alcor CZ, 99% of whose shares were
held (until the sale to Mizar) by Alcor.*** He also testified that it was he who directed Alcor CZ

5° that it was he who decided to sell Alcor’s

to commence the proceedings in the Czech courts,
shareholding in Alcor CZ because he needed the cash,**” and that he could not remember whether
the payments made (after the sale of the shares in Alcor CZ) as a percentage of the amount
recovered in the Czech court proceedings were made to Alcor or directly to himself.***

Given the nature of this relationship between ue and the two companies, the Tribunal
does not accept that the Respondent has erred in its treatment of the three actors. It is ui

state of mind that is relevant to questions such as the expectations which existed at the time that

the investment was made and it is his reasons for the sale of the shares in Alcor CZ to Mizar

which have to be taken into account when considering the effects of that sale.

Moreover, the Tribunal feels compelled to point out that the Claimant has not always been
consistent in respecting the differences between the three actors. In particular, when accusing the
courts of the Czech Republic of unfairness in the way in which they dealt with the proceedings
before them, the Claimant refers almost entirely to decisions taken by the Czech courts after the

Claimant had sold its shareholding in Alcor CZ.**

APPLICABLE LAW

It is common ground between the Parties that any jurisdiction which the Tribunal might possess
must ultimately be derived from Article 9 of the Treaty. As with any treaty, the law applicable to
the interpretation and application of the Treaty is public international law and it is that law which

the Tribunal is called upon to apply.

In particular, the Tribunal will look to the principles of treaty interpretation enshrined in Articles
31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969 (the “Vienna Convention”).

These Articles provide:

ARTICLE 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to
be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition

to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties
in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument
related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of
the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) — Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so
intended.

See, e.g., Claimant’s PHB, para. 65. For a summary of the judgments, see paras. 101-112, above.

243.

244.

245.

PCA Case No. 2018-45
Award
Page 63 of 78

ARTICLE 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory
work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning
resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the
interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

ARTICLE 33. INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES
AUTHENTICATED IN TWO OR MORE LANGUAGES

1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally
authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in
case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.

  

The Czech Republic became a party to the Vienna Convention by succession on 22 February
1993, more than a year before the conclusion of the Treaty with the UAE. The UAE is not a party
to the Vienna Convention. Nevertheless, the principles stated in the three Articles just quoted are
generally accepted as an authoritative statement of the customary international law regarding

treaty interpretation.

With regard to Article 33, the Tribunal notes that the final clause of the Treaty provides that it has
been made in “Czech, the Arabic and English languages, all texts being equally authentic. In case
of divergence, the English text shall prevail”. In view of that provision and the fact that the Parties
have referred throughout the proceedings to the English text with no suggestion that any relevant
provision might bear a different meaning in either of the other authentic languages, the Tribunal

will apply the English text.

In approaching the question whether or not the Tribunal possesses jurisdiction under the Treaty,
the Tribunal does not consider that the reference to the object and purpose of a treaty in Article
31(1) of the Vienna Convention requires it to apply a presumption in favour of jurisdiction. The
fact that one object of the Treaty, as laid down in its preamble, is to “create favourable conditions
for ... investments by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of another Contracting
State” does not, in the view of the Tribunal, justify any such presumption. Nor is the fact that a
State is not required to submit to the jurisdiction of international tribunals unless it has given its
consent to do so sufficient to justify a presumption that Article 9 should be interpreted
restrictively. Instead, the Tribunal approaches the interpretation of Article 9, and of the other

pertinent provisions of the Treaty, without any prior presumptions as to their meaning and effect.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT WAS AN INVESTOR AT THE RELEVANT TIME

As set out above (see paragraphs 117-132), the Respondent’s first objection to the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal is that, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings, the Claimant no longer
owned Alcor CZ and therefore was no longer an “investor” within the meaning of the Treaty. If
upheld, this objection would amount to a complete bar to jurisdiction and preclude consideration
of the merits of the case while rendering consideration of the other jurisdictional and admissibility

objections unnecessary.

The basic facts (see paragraphs 76-115, above) are not in dispute.

(a) Alcor created Alcor CZ in 2009;

(b) between 28 January 2010 and 16 June 2011 Alcor CZ purchased the Plots;

(c) on 19 June 2011 Alcor CZ commenced legal proceedings in the Czech courts;*
(d) on 20 March 2014 Alcor CZ significantly modified its claim;*°!

(e) on 24 February 2016 Alcor sold its shareholding in Alcor CZ;*

(f) on 30 June 2016 Alcor notified the Respondent of a claim under the BIT;

(g) on 27 September 2017 the District Court issued its judgment in the proceedings brought by
Alcor CZ

(h) on 17 April 2018 Alcor submitted its Notice of Arbitration;

(i) proceedings in the Czech courts between Alcor CZ and the City of Prague continued until

2 June 2020.**

1. The Date of Commencement of the Arbitration Proceedings
According to Article 3(2) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules:

Arbitral proceedings shall be deemed to commence on the date on which the notice of
arbitration is received by the respondent.

Alcor CZ v. Capital City of Prague, Complaint dated 19 June 2011 (Exhibit R-15).

It now appears that the Notice of Arbitration may not have been received by the Respondent until
3 May 2018. On the other hand, the Terms of Appointment of the Tribunal, which were approved
by both Parties, state, in para. 2.4, that:

In accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, these arbitration proceedings are deemed to have

commenced on 17 April 2018, the date on which the Respondent received the Notice of
Arbitration.

Since, however, it is common ground that the sale of the Claimant’s 99% shareholding in Alcor
CZ took place on 24 February 2016, more than two years before either of the possible dates of
commencement of the proceedings, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to determine which of

those dates should be treated as the actual date of commencement.

2. The Date at which Jurisdiction must Exist

The Tribunal considers that it is a general principle of international law that the date at which the
requirements for the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal must be established is the
date at which proceedings are commenced. As a leading commentator puts it:

It is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined

by reference to the date on which judicial proceedings are tuted. This means that on that

date all jurisdictional requirements must be met. It also means that events taking place after
that date will not affect jurisdiction.*°

  

 

That approach has been confirmed by other investment arbitration tribunals, whose decisions —
though not binding upon the present Tribunal — are nonetheless entitled to respect insofar as their
reasoning is persuasive. The Tribunal finds the reasoning of the tribunal in CSOB persuasive,

when that tribunal said:

 

 

. it is generally recognized that the determination whether a party has
international judicial forum for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedin;
reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been
the Claimant instituted these proceedings prior to the time when the two
concluded, it follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this case regardless of the legal
effect, if any, the assignments might have had on Claimant's standing had they preceded the
filing of the case.3%

tanding in an

  
  

 

  

 

In the case of arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty, there is an added reason why the
requirements for jurisdiction must exist at the date that the case is commenced. The essence of
arbitration is the agreement of the parties to arbitrate. In the case of investor-State arbitration,

that agreement is derived from the treaty but the treaty itself cannot be the agreement because the

investor is not a party to the treaty; the parties to the treaty are the States which concluded it.
Instead, the investor-State arbitration provision of the treaty operates as an offer by each of the
contracting States to investors of the other contracting State. That offer is accepted when the
investor commences arbitration proceedings. In short, it is the act of commencing the arbitration
which creates the agreement to arbitrate between the investor and the contracting State. The offer
in the treaty is made to a defined class. It follows, therefore, that the offer can be accepted only

by a person or entity who, at the moment of acceptance, falls within that defined class.

In the present case, Article 9 of the Treaty requires the Czech Republic to submit to arbitration
only where the case is brought by a person or corporation which is an “investor” of the UAE in
connection with an “investment” on the territory of the Czech Republic. A claimant must
therefore satisfy the requirements of Article 1(2), which defines the term “investor”, at the date
of the notice of arbitration. Article 1(2) provides that “[t]erm ‘investor’ shall mean the
Government of a Contracting State or any of its natural or juridical persons who invest in the

territory of the other Contracting State”.

3. The Effect of Sale of the Investment

That leads to the question which lies at the heart of the present case, namely whether a claimant
which had made a qualifying investment can bring itself within the jurisdiction of a tribunal under
Article 9 of the BIT if it no longer owns that investment at the date of commencing proceedings.
Since the critical date is the date of the commencement of the arbitration proceedings, it follows,
as the CSOB tribunal held, that sale or other divestment of an investment after the date of
commencement of the arbitration is irrelevant for the purposes of determining jurisdiction.*”
What matters for the present case is the effect of sale or other divestment prior to the date of

commencing the proceedings.

The Claimant argues that Article 9 contains no requirement that a claimant must be an investor at
the time that it commences arbitration proceedings. Article 9 must, however, be read together
with the definitions in Article 1(1) and 1(2). Article 1(2), as quoted in paragraph 117 above,
merely provides that an investor is any of a State’s natural or juridical persons “who invests in
the territory of the other Contracting State”. There is no express provision about when that
investment must be made, or about whether a person who has made an investment but no longer

owns it continues to qualify as an investor. However, in contrast to the provisions of the North

CSOB, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of 14 May 1999, para. 31 (RLA-12), note
106, above. A sale after the date on which proceedings are commenced may, of course, be relevant to
questions of quantum.

America Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), which were at issue in Mondev v. United States>*
the definition of an investor is not so drafted as to include someone who “seeks to make, is making
or has made an investment” (emphasis added). At most, therefore, Article 9 could be said to be
neutral on this question. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the more natural reading of the
relevant provisions of the Treaty is that it is not enough that a person made an investment at some
point in the past; to qualify as an investor, that person must ordinarily continue to hold that

investment at the time that it seeks to take advantage of Article 9.

The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant’s contention that “it would be illogical to the point of

99369

absurdity’ to hold that jurisdiction did not exist if a party which had made a qualifying
investment had ceased to own it before that party commenced arbitration proceedings. On the
contrary, the Tribunal considers that in such a case the party in question would normally no longer
be an “investor” at the date when it commenced arbitration proceedings and would therefore be
incapable of accepting the offer to arbitrate made in the investment treaty. What would be
illogical, in the Tribunal’s view, would be to read Article 9 as though it treated a person as an

investor even if that person had long since ceased to hold the investment in question.

That is implicit in the passage just quoted from the CSOB case. It is made explicit in Aven.*”” In
that case, the claimants brought proceedings against Costa Rica regarding a range of properties
which they had at one time owned in Costa Rica. Seventy-eight of those properties had been sold
by the claimants by the time of the hearing. The Tribunal found that sixty-seven of them had
been sold before the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and that it therefore lacked
jurisdiction with regard to the claims concerning those properties. Contrary to what is suggested
by the Claimant in the present case, in reaching that decision, the Aven tribunal was concerned
not with whether the claimants had ever owned the properties but whether, and when, they had

ceased to own them.*”!

After quoting with approval the passage cited above from the CSOB decision, the Aven tribunal

continued:

See para. 129, above.

Aven, Final Award of 18 September 2008 (RLA-8), note 107, above.

   

At para. 289 of the Award, the Aven tribunal states that “the central dispute between the Parti
the properties sold before and during this arbitration should be included in the Claimants’ investment”. That
hat the properties were at one point owned by the claimants and the tribunal plainly proceeded

PCA Case No. 2018-45
Award
Page 68 of 78

. the relevant precedent articulates that investments liquidated or transferred after the
initiation of arbitral proceedings are covered investments in DR-CAFTA proceedings. In line
with Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL which states that “arbitral proceedings shall be deemed
to commence on the date on which the notice of arbitration is received by the respondent”,
the Tribunal determines that the date of the Notice of Arbitration — in this case, January 20,
2014 — is the date which should delineate which properties were sold after the initiation of
this arbitration and thereby, which have the character of a covered investment under Article
10.28 of DR-CAFTA. Accordingly, the Tribunal expressly rejects Claimants’ assertion that
all lots sold after May 2011 are covered investments. Instead, the threshold date of sale stands
as January 20, 2014.57

The Aven tribunal concluded:

... the relevant case law instructs that in general terms, an investment sold after the date of
Notice of Arbitration meets the criteria for an “investment” in terms of DR-CAFTA [the
Dominican Republic — Central America Free Trade Agreement]. On the other hand, an
investor who disposes of ownership of the investment in question before arbitral proceedings
should not be eligible to seek the Treaty’s protection, unless special circumstances are
present. Such circumstances include, inter alia, the loss of the investment by actions of a
third party or the retroactive application of a treaty, neither of which are applicable to the
matter at hand.*7°

 

The Claimant urges the Tribunal to prefer the analysis in the Daimler Award, paragraph 145 of

which states:

The better view would seem to be that ICSID claims are at least in principle separable from
their underlying investments. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s contention
that the Claimant’s ICSID claims (or at least those connected with the shareholding) were
necessarily and automatically transferred along with the shares by operation of law. Rather,
the Tribunal finds that it should accord standing to any qualifying investor under the relevant
treaty texts who suffered damages a result of the allegedly offending governmental
measures at the time that those measures were taken — provided that the investor did not
otherwise relinquish its right to bring an ICSID claim.3”

 

 

The Claimant points out that, far from relinquishing any claim for breach of the Treaty when it
sold its shareholding in Alcor CZ to Mizar, it expressly reserved its right to claim for any breach
of the Treaty which had taken place prior to the date of the transfer to Mizar.*”> The Claimant
therefore maintains that, even if the sale were a purely voluntary one, it would not affect the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of a claim brought by Alcor for a breach of the Treaty which

had occurred before the sale took place in February 2016.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that it should follow Daimler. First, it sees no reason of logic or
policy for divorcing the right to claim from the ownership of the investment with regard to which

the claim is made. Moreover, it appears to the Tribunal that to do so risks confusing questions of

jurisdiction and questions of merits. If jurisdiction is made to depend upon a claimant establishing
that it suffered a treaty breach before the sale of its investment, then in order to decide whether or
not it has jurisdiction to determine the case on its merits, a tribunal would first have to rule on the
merits of the case. That puts the cart before the horse and cannot be right. On the other hand, if
it is sufficient that a claimant merely advances a claim for a breach which it says occurred before
the sale of its investment, that would negate the principle that the Tribunal has just accepted and
would make the existence or not of jurisdiction dependent upon the way in which the claimant

formulates its case.

Secondly, the Tribunal considers that the circumstances of the present case differ from those of
the Daimler case in a number of important ways. The assignment of the investment in Daimler
was from the claimant company to its own parent company (both being German corporations)
and was a response to the unprofitability of the subsidiary following the measures taken by
Argentina. The precise relationship between the Claimant and Mizar is unclear.*”° It was not,
however, a relationship of parent and subsidiary within a corporate group undergoing

restructuring.

Moreover, in Daimler, the nature and content of the dispute under the BIT was already clear
before the sale occurred. The Daimler case concerned measures taken by Argentina in 2001-02
to “pesify” debts owed to the Claimant’s Argentine subsidiary, as part of the measures taken by

Argentina in response to the currency crisis in that country.*” The effect of these provisions was

  

to abrogate the assurances of a right of currency conversion on the basis of which Daimler

maintained it had made its investment in its Argentine subsidiary.

The facts of the present case are very different. Alcor CZ acquired the Plots between January
2010 and June 2011. ue testified that he had identified the purchase of these Plots as a
good investment likely to secure a substantial return because the existing owners lacked the
knowledge and resources to pursue claims against the City which would be likely to take time.°*
In other words, not only did the Claimant know that it was likely to take some time to realise any
gains but that time factor was a central element in its investment planning — MiB considered
that he could devote to the claims the time and resources which the previous owners could not

and that was why the Claimant could purchase the Plots at a favourable price.

It was also central to the Claimant’s strategy that the City could be persuaded, or compelled, to
pay compensation based on the formula used in Resolution No. 2141. But the Claimant has not
produced any evidence to suggest that the City had ever paid compensation fo another landowner
on the basis of the formula which that Resolution had laid down for payments to be made from
private parties to the City, or that it had ever made any representation that it would do so. That is
confirmed by the evidence of 7 Mr Ha. who controlled the affairs of the
Claimant, must, therefore, have been aware that the process would not be straightforward and
might well involve court proceedings. Yet the Claimant sold its shareholding in Alcor CZ before
Alcor CZ had received any substantive judgment from the District Court in which it had

commenced proceedings.

It is difficult to see, therefore, that any dispute regarding the application of the BIT existed
between the Claimant and the Respondent before the sale of Alcor’s shares in Alcor CZ. Neither
the correspondence between Alcor (or Alcor CZ) and the Czech Republic, nor what the Tribunal
has seen of the pleadings in the cases before the Czech courts contains any suggestion of such a

dispute. The BIT appears never to have been mentioned.

A further distinction is that, in Daimler, the measures taken by Argentina in 2001-02 had been
unexpected and had already taken effect by the time of the sale. By contrast, in the present case,
as the tribunal has already found, the Claimant had invested in the expectation that it might have
to resort to the local courts and it chose to sell the investment before it had received even a single
substantive judgment from those courts. Yet the Claimant makes much in its pleadings of the
alleged failures of the Czech courts which, if they took place at all, did so only afier the sale to

Mizar.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant states:

64. The Claimant’s position is that the Courts failed to administer justice (ie, failed to
create circumstances to enable claims to be properly dealt with), as opposed to
denying justice to the Claimant. The failure of the Court is that it has not established
an effective means for asserting claims for foreign investors. That is the purpose of
these proceedings. The simple logic is that the Claimant invested money in a series of
transactions into the state with the expectation that its investment would be protected
by the BIT. Prague breached its obligations under the BIT and the Claimant raises
unfair treatment because the Courts failed to have regard to the generally accepted
standard of the admii ation of justice.

 
        

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

  

65. It follows from the judgment of the Czech Courts that they did not carefully examine
the content of the Equity Solutions report, by which the authors of this report
determined the usual market rent price of the land. This should have been done by the
District Court for Prague 10 (Court of the First Instance), which instead uncritically
accepted the conclusion of Equity Solutions, or by the Municipal court in Prague
(Appeal Court). In compliance with Czech law, neither the Supreme Court nor the

276.

Award
Page 71 of 78

Constitutional Court reviewed the Equity Solutions report as none of them were
competent to do so.

Yet this allegation refers to events which took place after the Claimant sold its interest in Alcor

CZ to Mizar and thus could not give rise to a claim by Alcor.

In these circumstances, even if the Tribunal had preferred the analysis in Daimler to that in Aven,

it would have found that the Daimler analysis was not applicable to the present case.

The Tribunal, however, prefers the analysis in Aven, which confirms the conclusion at which the
Tribunal had already arrived, namely that, unless there are special circumstances, or the treaty
otherwise provides, it is a requirement of jurisdiction that the claimant still hold the investment at
the date of commencing proceedings. In the Aven case, the claimants had divested themselves of
only some of their investments, so that the ruling of the tribunal did not preclude jurisdiction over
the entire case. It merely limited the scope of the claim to those properties still owned by the
claimants at the time that they commenced proceedings. In the present case, however, the
Claimant had sold the entirety of its shareholding in Alcor CZ more than two years before the
commencement of arbitration proceedings. In principle, therefore, the Claimant had ceased to be
an investor in 2016 and thus could not, in 2018, accept the offer of arbitration contained in
Article 9 of the Treaty. The Tribunal does not consider that “ownership” of a right to bring a

claim is itself an investment.

The Tribunal accepts that there are cases in which an investor has ceased to own the investment
before the commencement of arbitration proceedings but nevertheless retains the capacity to
accept the offer of arbitration in an investment treaty — these are the “special circumstances” to

which the Aven tribunal referred.

That raises the question what are “special circumstances” for these purposes. The Tribunal
considers that these are necessarily fact specific and that it is neither possible nor desirable to
attempt to create a comprehensive list of what might constitute special circumstances. It is,

however, appropriate to look to what has been regarded as special circumstances in other awards.

Leaving aside the reference in Aven to the retroactive application of a treaty, which is not in issue
here, the most obvious example is where the investment has been expropriated. In such a case,
the loss of ownership is not voluntary but is the effect of the very breach of treaty which the
claimant seeks to challenge. To prevent a claimant from bringing a case in such circumstances
would be to allow the defendant State to profit from its own wrong and frustrate a core object of

the treaty.

The same logic applies where an investor is forced to sell the investment — as, for example, many
Jewish owners were forced to sell their property by Nazi authorities between 1933 and 1945. The
Tribunal accepts that the sale would not preclude the investor from pursuing a claim.*”
The present case does not fall into either of these categories. Counsel for the Claimant made clear
at the hearing that this was not an expropriation case.**” Nor is there any evidence that there was
a forced sale. The nearest that the Claimant comes to alleging a degree of coercion is in a passage
in its Post-Hearing Brief, in which it states that:

The Tribunal does not need to be reminded of the length of time this matter has been ongoing.

It would be an over-statement to say that the Respondent had starved the Claimant into

submission, but what can be said is that by virtue of the length of time that had been taken,

the Claimant was pushed into a position where the liquidation of the asset was necessary. **!
The Tribunal agrees that it would be an “over-statement” to suggest that the Claimant was
“starved into submission”. But nor does it accept that the Claimant was pushed into the position
where it had to liquidate the asset because of the length of time that had been taken over Alcor
CZ’s claims to compensation for unjust enrichment or payment by way of a lease or other

arrangement with the City.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the explanation given in evidence by Mr
namely that he had tired of the process and needed cash, is an accurate description of why the
shareholding in Alcor CZ was sold. However, the inference which the Tribunal draws from what
Mr said is rather different from that suggested by the Claimant. The Tribunal does not
read his evidence as in any way suggesting that this was a fire sale or that it had been compelled
by misconduct on the part of the Respondent.**” Rather, Mi wished to invest elsewhere.
The fact that the price paid by Mizar for the shares in Alcor CZ appears to have been determined
not by a calculation of the value of the shares (and thus of the Plots which were Alcor CZ’s main
asset) but by reference to the amount of money that ui needed to pursue other investment

opportunities also confirms that this is not a case of a forced sale.***

See also Mondev, Award of 11 October 2002, note 369, above, cited by the Aven tribunal at paras. 297-298,

ownership of the investment because of a third party foreclosing on a mortgage.

The present case thus fits into neither of the recognized cases of “special circumstances”. As the
Tribunal has already made clear, it does not consider that the categories of special circumstances
are closed but it does not see anything else about the present case which could constitute such
circumstances. The fact that the Claimant sought to reserve, in its sale to Mizar, a supposed right
to claim under the BIT (the first mention of the BIT in any of the documents in the record) cannot
in itself amount to a special circumstance. To hold otherwise would be to drive a coach and four
through the principle in Aven. Nor is there any evidence that the sale was a necessary attempt to
mitigate loss, something which would also be undermined by the fact that the sale price seems to
have been determined by the amount needed for Mi other investment plans, rather than

an estimate of the likely present or future value of the shares.

In view of the reasoning set out above, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to examine the
Respondent's allegation that the sale to Mizar of the shares in Alcor CZ was not a genuine arms-

length transaction.

The Tribunal therefore upholds the Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection. Since that is
sufficient to dispose of the case, it is unnecessary to consider the other objections or to enter into

questions of the merits or quantum.

COSTS

284. Article 38 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules provides that:

285.

286.

384

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term “costs” includes
only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be
fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

 

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved
by the arbitral tribunal;

 

(e) The costs for legal representation and a ince of the successful party if such costs
were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral
tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

 

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the
Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.
The BIT contains no provisions relating to costs and there is no special agreement between the
Parties on that subject beyond the provisions of the Terms of Appointment which stipulate the
hourly rate for the fees of the members of the Tribunal and the reimbursement of their expenses
(para. 11) and that the PCA will charge for its services in accordance with its normal schedule of
fees (para. 8). Costs are therefore governed by Article 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the
relevant part of which provides that:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne
by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such

costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into
account the circumstances of the case.

 

   

  

(2) With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article
38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the
case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion
such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

 

Article 40 thus distinguishes between two categories of costs: those covered by Article 38,
paragraphs (a) to (d) and paragraph (f) (“the Tribunal costs”), and those covered by Article 38,
paragraph (e) (“the costs of representation”). As both Parties accept in their submissions on
costs, Article 40(1) starts with a presumption that the Tribunal costs are to be borne by the
unsuccessful Party, although the second sentence gives the Tribunal a discretion to depart from
that principle by apportioning the Tribunal costs between the Parties “if itd etermines th at
apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case”. With regard to

4

the costs of representation, there is no such presumption*™ and it is left to the Tribunal to

 

st to the position under Article 42(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules.

287.

288.

289.

290.

PCA Case No. 2018-45
Award
Page 75 of 78

apportion such costs if it considers apportionment to be reasonable in the circumstances of the
case. In addition, Article 38, paragraph (e) provides that each Party’s costs of representation are
to be treated as costs of the arbitration only to the extent that the Tribunal determines those costs

to be reasonable.

While the starting point for the Tribunal is therefore different for the Tribunal costs from the
starting point in respect of costs of representation, in each case the Tribunal has a discretion to
apportion the costs on the basis of what is reasonable, taking account of the circumstances of the

case. This discretion is a broad one.

In the present case, the Respondent has been completely successful on a jurisdictional objection.
Both Parties have litigated in good faith and there is nothing about either Party’s conduct of the

case which was unreasonable.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the principle that, with regard
to Tribunal costs, costs follow the event. The Claimant will therefore bear the entirety of the

Tribunal costs, which consist of:

(a) The fees and expenses of Mr Richard Wilmot-Smith, QC, which come to EUR

and EUR. respectively.

(b) The fees of Professor Donald McRae, including HST, which come to EUR

(c) | The fees and expenses of Sir Christopher Greenwood, which come to EUR and
EUR respectively

(d) The fees of Ms a. the Assistant to the President, which come to

(e) The fees of the PCA, which acts as Registry in accordance with the Terms of Appointment,

So far as the costs of legal representation are concerned, the Parties assess their costs as follows:

(a) The Claimant: AED 979,475.63 (fees of Taylor Wessing LLP Dubai Branch) (equating to
approximately EUR 234,000), plus EUR 353,687.43 (fees of Taylor and Wessing LLP
Prague Branch and the Claimant’s expert), a total of approximately EUR 587,687;

(b) The Respondent: CZK 16,392,148.69 equating to approximately EUR 637,225 for

counsel’s fees and costs.

In view of the Respondent’s success in its jurisdictional challenge, the Tribunal considers that
costs should follow the event. Since the Respondent’s costs of legal representation are only
slightly higher than those of the Claimant, the Tribunal considers them reasonable and directs that

the Claimant shall reimburse the Respondent for the entirety of those costs.
