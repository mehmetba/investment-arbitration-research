INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This arbitration concerns a legal dispute between TCCA and Pakistan arising out of
TCCA’s investments in Pakistan submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’”) on the basis of the Agreement between
Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection of
Investments, which was signed on 7 February 1998 and entered into force on 14 October
1998 (the “Australia-Pakistan BIT”, the “Treaty” or the “BIT”)! and the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,
dated October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 10 November 2017 (the “Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability”), the Tribunal found that, for the reasons set out therein: (i)
it has jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims and that the claims are admissible;? and (ii)
by its denial of a mining lease to Claimant’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Tethyan Copper
Company Pakistan (Private) Limited (“TCCP”), in order to allow the Government of
Balochistan (“GOB”) to implement its own project instead, Respondent has breached its
obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the
Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not
comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty,
and impaired the use of Claimant’s investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.*

This Award addresses the question whether as a result of Respondent’s breaches,
Claimant has suffered damage for which it must be compensated by Respondent and, if
so, determines the amount of such compensation.

The Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability as well as the Tribunal’s Decision on
Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons) also dated 10 November
2017 are hereby incorporated by reference into this Award.

9. On 28 November 2011, Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration with the Secretary-

General of ICSID (the “Secretary-General”) pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID
Convention” (the “Request”). Article 36 of the ICSID Convention provides:

“(1) Any Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State wishing to

institute arbitration proceedings shall address a request to that effect in

writing to the Secretary-General who shall send a copy of the request to the
other party.

(2) The request shall contain information concerning the issues in dispute, the
identity of the parties and their consent to arbitration in accordance with the
rules of procedure for the institution of conciliation and arbitration
proceedings.

(3) The Secretary-General shall register the request unless he finds, on the

basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly

outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith notify the parties of

registration or refusal to register.”
On 12 January 2012, the Secretary-General registered the Request in accordance with
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute
an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

Constitution of the Tribunal

On 12 July 2012, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was composed of Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, a national
of Germany, President, appointed by agreement of the parties; Mr. John Beechey, a
national of Great Britain, appointed by the Claimant; and Rt. Hon. Lord Leonard
Hoffmann, a British national, appointed by the Respondent. Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-
Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary to the
Tribunal.

Following the resignation of Mr. John Beechey, Claimant appointed Dr. Stanimir
Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria and the Tribunal was reconstituted on 10 September
2012.

Procedural Background Previous to the Quantum Phase

As reflected in Section 14 of Procedural Order No. 1 dated 3 December 2012, it was
agreed between the Parties and the Tribunal that the Parties would in a first phase file
submissions on jurisdiction and liability and that the need for a second phase of the

* Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18
March 1965.

proceeding, on the quantum of damages, would be determined based on the Tribunal’s
decision in the first phase or the intervening course of events in Pakistan.

On 27 October 2015, in the context of discussions on a time schedule to address certain
new issues raised in Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims dated 2 September
2015, the Tribunal, inter alia, informed the Parties of the following:

“The Tribunal would like to inform the Parties that it has almost

concluded its deliberations on the case and that the draft of its Decision

on Jurisdiction and Liability is in a very advanced stage. In light of the

circumstances, the Tribunal will finalize, and provide the Parties with,

a draft of the Decision that it would have rendered but for the issues

raised in Respondent’s Application. The Tribunal notes that, while this

approach is not provided for by ICSID, it is common practice in the

WTO and also provided for in Article 10.20(9) lit. a of the CAFTA. By

analogy to the latter provision, the Parties may submit their comments

on the draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability within 60 days of its

transmission by the Tribunal. Any such comments will be duly

considered by the Tribunal in its ultimate Decision on Jurisdiction and

Liability.”
On 3 February 2016 and having given advance notice to the Parties of its intention to do
so on 27 October 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with its Draft Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability and invited them to provide comments on errors of fact,
misprints, etc. within 60 days of the decision’s transmission to the Parties.

On 4 April 2016, the Parties submitted their respective comments on the Tribunal’s Draft
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.

On 20 March 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent's Application to
Dismiss the Claims (with reasons to follow).

On 6 November 2017, Respondent submitted a Request for Reconsideration of the Draft
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (“Respondent’s Reconsideration Request”).

On 10 November 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability,
which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Award. The submissions on
jurisdiction and the merits were summarized in that Decision. For a summary of the
procedural history leading up to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, see paragraphs
5 to 215 of that Decision.

In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal for the reasons set out therein
(see paragraphs 564 to 1374 with respect to Claimant’s claims; and paragraphs 1407 to
1446 with respect to Respondent’s counterclaims) decided as follows:

I. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims
submitted to it by Claimant.

I. Claimant's claims are admissible.

and losses resulting from Respondent's breaches of the
Treaty, in an amount to be determined in a later phase of

of Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty is dismissed.

VII. The Tribunal's decision on the costs of this phase of the
proceeding is reserved for the Award.

Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons) (“Decision on Respondent’s
Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons)”), which is hereby incorporated by
reference into this Award, concerning an Application to Dismiss the Claims filed by
Respondent on 2 September 2015. For a summary of the procedural history leading up to
the Decision on Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims (with reasons), see
paragraphs 6 to 182 of that Decision.

After carefully reviewing all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties in
the course of that phase of the proceedings concerning Respondent’s allegations of
corruption as well as, to the extent relevant in that context, the arguments and evidence
adduced in the previous phase on jurisdiction and liability, the Tribunal for the reasons
set out in paragraphs 209 to 1496 of its Decision on Respondent’s Application to Dismiss
the Claims (with reasons), decided as follows:

I. The evidence submitted by Respondent as well as the
counter-evidence submitted by Claimant in the present
phase of the proceeding are admitted into the record.

Il. Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims dated 2
September 2015 is dismissed in its entirety.

II. Respondent has not established any of its individual
allegations of corruption that would be attributable to
Claimant and that could have become relevant as
potential contributory fault in the quantum phase that is
now to follow.

Balochistan seeks an adjournment of the hearing scheduled for 21 Feb 2018 as a
temporary measure pending disposition of the request; (iii) establish an expedited briefing
schedule and a videoconference for oral argument of this Request; and, alternatively (iv)
not admit any supposed new evidence obtained through the Islamabad High Court
proceedings. Paragraph 72 of Claimant’s Provisional Measures Request included a
temporary measure request “that the Tribunal order Pakistan to take steps to ensure that
Balochistan seeks an adjournment of the hearing currently scheduled for 21 February
2018 as a temporary measure pending disposition of this Request, and establish an
expedited briefing schedule and a videoconference for oral argument on this Request”
(the “Temporary Measure Request”). On 15 February 2018, the Tribunal invited

2018. On the same date, Respondent filed an extension request until 21 February 2018.
On 16 February 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment on Respondent’s
extension request, which it did on the same date. Subsequently, also on 16 February 2018,
Respondent reiterated its extension request. On 17 February 2018, the Tribunal rejected
Respondent’s extension request, noting that Respondent had not yet been asked to
comment on Claimant’s Provisional Measures Request in its entirety but only on the
Temporary Measure Request of adjourning the hearing that was scheduled before the
Islamabad High Court on 21 February 2018. In particular, Respondent was invited to
explain on what basis it considered that “the jurisdictional issue will not be resolved at
the next hearing before the IHC.” On 19 February 2018, Respondent filed its comments
on Claimant’s Temporary Measure Request. On 20 February 2018, the Tribunal informed
the Parties that the Tribunal denied Claimant’s Temporary Measure Request and fixed a
briefing schedule for written submissions on Claimant’s Provisional Measures Request.

On 16 February 2018, Respondent filed an application requesting the Tribunal to clarify
and reconsider Procedural Order No. 21 (“Requests concerning PO-21”). On 20

issued Procedural Order No. 22 regarding Respondent’s Requests concerning PO-21 and
other procedural matters.

Measures Request. On 5 March 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that Respondent was
invited to submit its Rejoinder on Claimant’s Provisional Measures Request by 9 March
2018 and noted that the Tribunal would render a decision on Claimant’s Request for
Provisional Measures only if and when it had been provided with notice to do so from the
Parties. On 9 March 2018, Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Claimant’s Provisional
Measures Request together with Exhibit RE-635.

supporting documentation (the “Site Visit Report”). On 4 March 2018, Claimant filed
observations on the Site Visit Report. On 5 March 2018, the Tribunal acknowledged
receipt of Claimant’s letter dated 4 March 2018 regarding Prof. Dagdelen's Site Visit
Report, the interim results of the metallurgical testing and the process used to extract and
transport water samples from the Fan Sediments, and invited Respondent to comment by
7 March 2018. On 7 March 2018, Respondent filed a response to the Claimant’s
observations on the Site Visit Report. On 8 March 2018, the Tribunal; (i) provided
directions to the Parties on the Site Visit Report related matters, ordering Respondent to
submit “documentary evidence and/or witness testimony to establish the process used to
extract and transport water samples from the Fan Sediments, including a report from any
vendor Pakistan employed’; and (ii) directed the Parties to refrain from filing further
applications and requests in order to allow the Parties and the Tribunal to prepare for the
Hearing on Quantum. On 9 March 2018, Respondent filed an extension request, which
was followed by objections from Claimant, and, subsequently, by a message from
Respondent reiterating its extension request and attaching copy of a letter to Claimant’s
counsel regarding Lab Costs. On 20 March 2018, Respondent filed a submission
concerning the Site Visit and the extraction and transportation of water, together with
supporting documents on water collection and a witness statement of Mr. Javaid Ahmed.
On the same date, Respondent filed an Expert Report by Prof. Erik Spiller regarding
Metallurgical Testing, along with 5 appendices.

On 28 February 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent’s Request for
Reconsideration of the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, which had been
provided to the Parties as a draft on 3 February 2016 and was rendered in final form on
10 November 2017 (“Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request”). For the
reasons indicated therein, Respondent’s Request dated 6 November 2017 for
Reconsideration of the Tribunal’ s Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was rejected, and
the decision on the costs incurred in relation to Respondent’s Reconsideration Request
was reserved for the Final Award. For a summary of the procedural history leading up to
the Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request, see paragraphs 2 to 13 of that
Decision.

Also, on 28 February 2018, Claimant filed a renewed request for certain orders from the
Tribunal regarding Respondent’s allegedly deficient production of documents pursuant
to Procedural Order No. 20 (“Claimant’s Document Production Request”). On 1
March 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment. On 7 March 2018, Respondent
filed observations on the Claimant’s Document Production Request with a Redfern
Schedule and attachments. On 12 March 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.
23 concerning Claimant’s Document Production Request, where it allowed Claimant to
file, if it so wished, a supplemental reply on quantum.

accordance with Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

84. For a detailed summary of the factual background to the dispute between the Parties, the
Tribunal makes reference to Section IV of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.

85. The Tribunal further notes that in the present phase of the proceeding, it has been
presented with certain additional facts, supplementing the chronology of events as set out
in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, which are either undisputed between the
Parties or are otherwise established by the evidence submitted in these proceedings to the
satisfaction of the Tribunal. These will be addressed as part of the Tribunal’s reasoning
on the consequences flowing from Respondent’s breaches.

V. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

A. Summary of Claimant’s Contentions

86. Claimant submits that it should be awarded compensation in the amount of USD 8.5
billion plus interest, reflecting the damage that it has incurred as a result of Respondent’s
wrongful denial of the mining lease application submitted by TCCP to the Director
General of the Mines & Mineral Development Department of Balochistan (the
“Licensing Authority”) on 15 February 2011 (the “Mining Lease Application” or the
“Application”), which deprived it of the opportunity to build and operate the mine at
Reko Digq.>

1. On the Legal Standards Governing Claimant’s Claim for Compensation

87. Claimant submits that the Tribunal must award compensation equal to the “market value”
of Claimant’s investment as of 15 November 2011 and, in assessing that value, it must
disregard all of the unlawful acts that Respondent has committed prior to that valuation
date.° In Claimant’s view, the Australia-Pakistan BIT does not specify the remedies for
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty and the Tribunal must therefore apply the standard
of full reparation under customary international law, as established in Chorzéw Factory,
ie., the award “must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act

and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that acted
had not been committed.”

88. Claimant accepts that it must show that Respondent’s Treaty breaches caused its loss but
considers that the causal relationship has already been determined by the Tribunal in its
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and all that remains is for that loss to be quantified. *

89. Claimant further accepts that it has the burden of proof as to its loss. As to the standard
of proof, Claimant submits that once it has been shown that a loss has been incurred,
damages should be awarded even if the specific amount cannot be assessed with
certainty.”

90. Claimant submits that the amount of its loss should be quantified based on the DCF
valuation method, more specifically the “practical, industry-informed application of well-
established principles” used in the modern DCF model applied by its valuation expert
Prof. Davis which it considers to be “the best method to value a development-stage mining
project like Reko Diq.”®

91. In Claimant’s view, neither a comparables valuation approach nor a cost-based method
could capture the value of its investment as it puts the investor in the position as if the
investment had never occurred — rather than the position as if the breaches had not
occurred as required by the principle of full reparation. In Claimant’s view, the same
applies to the valuation method applied by Respondent’s valuation expert Dr. Burrows
because it is also a backword-looking method and has in any event not been correctly
applied.'!

2. On the Terms of the Mineral Agreement and the Risks and Issues Raised by
Respondent

92. Claimant takes the position that if the Governments had continued to negotiate in good
faith, the parties would have entered into a “mutually beneficial and commercially
reasonable” mineral agreement, as contemplated by the 2002 BM Rules and the 1995
National Mineral Policy (the “Mineral Agreement”), and the question remained only on
what terms. According to Claimant, the fiscal terms that Prof. Davis used in his model
were the terms on which the Governments and TCC would likely have agreed but for the
Governments’ takeover and abandonment of negotiations: (i) a 2% provincial royalty; (ii)

Export Processing Zone (“EPZ”) status for the first 15 years followed by the normal tax
regime; (iii) extension of TCCP’s mining lease for the life of the mine; and (iv)

participation by Balochistan through a 25% Net Profit Interest.!”

Claimant further argues that neither of Respondent’s criticisms on geology and
metallurgy affects the value of the project because they are factually incorrect and “reveal
a profound lack of understanding about mining practices in general and the Reko Diq
project in particular.” Claimant maintains that its resource estimate is “highly reliable”
and submits that: (i) its metallurgical sampling adequately represented the material to be
processed by the mine; and (ii) its metallurgical testing validated “consistently high

recoveries of copper and gold at marketable concentrate grades.”'*

Claimant submits that it was committed to building the mine at Reko Diq and had
developed the necessary plans to do so. According to Claimant, “TCC’s Feasibility Study
covered all the technical aspects required to build a project of this scale, as well as the
capital and operating costs required to engineer, construct, and eventually operate both

the initial mine and the planned expansion case.”'*

According to Claimant, Respondent’s arguments on water ignore the Tribunal’s findings
in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Claimant also notes that it had identified: (i)
an aquifer that was “not only an abundant source of water but which could be utilized
without any significant effect on surrounding communities’; (ii) three backup sources;
and (iii) the possibility to build a sea water pipeline. Claimant further claims that any
residual risk that remained as of November 2011 has been accounted for by Prof. Davis.'>

Claimant contends that it “fully recognized and addressed the relevant security risks,
including those associated with transporting the slurry concentrate by pipeline to the port
of Gwadar.” Claimant refers to the chapters on security and risk included in both the
Initial Mine Development Feasibility Study submitted by Claimant to the Government of
Balochistan on 26 August 2010 (the “Feasibility Study”) and the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study completed in July 2010 (the “Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study”) as
well as the “comprehensive Risk Register in which risks were catalogued, assigned a
mitigation strategy, and tracked with respect to progress.” According to Claimant, the
costs associated with the security plans were accounted for in the operating and capital
cost estimates, with “significant contingencies totaling more than half a billion dollars”
built into the capital expense estimates. !° In any event, Claimant claims that Prof. Davis’

model “fully accounts for any security costs.” In particular, Claimant refers to Prof.
Davis’ inclusion of a 0.5% annual likelihood of permanent pre-mature mine shut-down
of Reko Diq due to acts of extreme political violence, which, according to Prof. Davis,
“reduces the value of the investment by US$ 1.4 billion, or 14% relative to a scenario

where this risk would be absent.”"”

Claimant submits that its approach to identifying, assessing and managing potential
environmental and social risks of the project was consistent with international best
practices and in line with what lenders and regulators would have expected for the Reko
Diq project at this stage. Claimant considers that none of the criticisms raised by
Respondent are material enough to have an effect on the quality of the Environmental and
Social Impact Assessment for the Reko Dig Project dated November 2010 (“ESIA”). It
further argues that the ESIA process reflected a dynamic collaboration between Claimant,
its owners and third-party consultants and maintains that the final ESIA ensured
compliance with the most stringent standards in the industry.'*

Claimant submits that none of the allegations raised by Respondent with regard to
permitting established an impact on the valuation of the project beyond the delays that
Prof. Davis has already incorporated into his valuation model. Claimant contends that: (i)
it did not experience significant problems securing approvals, licenses or permits for the
project; (ii) it took appropriate steps to address future permitting needs; and (iii) in any
event, Prof. Davis incorporated longer delays into his model than any of the delays posited
by Respondent.!?

Finally, Claimant asserts that in the absence of Respondent’s breaches, the Reko Diq
project would have attracted the necessary financing, as it had the full support of its
sponsors, Antofagasta and Barrick. According to Claimant, this is confirmed by the fact
they the sponsors had invested hundreds of millions of US dollars in the Feasibility Study
and were willing to contribute 60% of the project costs. It argues that lenders “would have
given great weight not only to the sponsors’ financial capacity but also to their

managerial, technical, and operating expertise.””°

On Prof. Davis’ Adjustments for Systematic and Asymmetric Risks

Claimant submits that Prof. Davis appropriately discounted the project’s future cash flows
for both systematic and asymmetric risks as well as for the time value of money. Claimant

21 Claimant’

explains that Prof. Davis applied risk-adjusted cash flows derived from futures and
forward prices which are already discounted for systematic risk. It specifically rejects
Respondent’s allegation that the cash flows and specifically the revenues in Prof. Davis’
model are the same as in the DCF model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.!

Claimant further rejects the allegation that Prof. Davis’ model implies a 4.2% discount
rate, which would be only 1.2 percentage points above the risk-free rate. According to
Claimant, this implied rate does not fully capture the significant asymmetric risk
adjustments made by Prof. Davis but most importantly does not capture the discount for
systematic risk. Claimant further emphasizes that Prof. Davis increased the cost estimates
in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility study by a total of 58%.??

According to Claimant, Prof. Davis has also fully accounted for asymmetric risks,
including the country risk affecting the project because of its location in Pakistan and in
particular Balochistan. Claimant notes that according to Respondent, the most prominent
risks associated with the project’s location are political violence and security risks and
argues that Prof. Davis took these into account in three ways: (i) he incorporated an annual
0.5% probability of a complete and permanent project shutdown; (ii) he included
“substantial premiums for insurance that would protect against the effects of political
violence, terrorist attacks, and other security threats’, and (iii) he adjusted various costs
and production quantities to reflect the residual risk of various security threats. In addition
to country risk, Claimant asserts that Prof. Davis also accounted for further asymmetric
risk by incorporating the potential effects of project delays, which reduced the value of
Claimant’s investment by USD 1.3 billion.??

According to Claimant, Respondent has failed to present any credible valuation which
could have been compared with Prof. Davis’ modern DCF valuation; it only submitted
“Dr. Burrows’s odd and unconvincing ‘prior transaction’ approach” which concluded
that the project was worth even less than in 2006. Claimant contends that Dr. Burrows’
prior transaction analysis is “irredeemably flawed’ because the 2006 transaction is

“simply not ‘comparable’” to the 2011 project, as confirmed by the “massive adjustments”
made by Dr. Burrows in his analysis. More importantly, Claimant argues that Dr.
Burrows’ analysis contradicts the “foundational principle” of the value curve according
to which “project value increases exponentially as sponsors’ certainty about the

underlying mineral resources and about the feasibility of the mine plan increases.”*

Claimant further emphasizes that Respondent’s valuation experts Mr. Brailovsky and
Prof. Wells did not present any DCF valuation of the project but only stated that the

project either had no value, a negative value or the value estimated by Dr. Burrows,
without proving actual calculations or supporting evidence for their assertions. According
to Claimant, the IRR reported in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, on which they
relied, is “not a particularly useful indicator of the value of the Project” given that it is
“by definition, a conservative analytical tool” which was “the result of conservative
assumptions” and did not reflect the actual rate of return expected for the project.
Claimant adds that the IRRs and NPVs are evaluations rather than valuations as they are
intended to test the project and determine that it can break even but not to calculate how

profitable it can be.?>

Claimant further emphasizes that “[d]espite all of this deliberate conservatism,” the
Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study confirmed the robustness of the project, yielding a net
present value of USD 1.206 billion at a 10% discount rate. It adds that Prof. Davis’ update
of the calculation to the valuation date yielded a net present value of USD 4.0 billion;
Claimant’s 75% share of that NPV would have been USD 3.0 billion.”°

On Pre-Award and Post-Award Interest

Finally, Claimant submits that the principle of full reparation requires that it be awarded
pre-award and post-award compound interest to be calculated at either: (i) Respondent’s
short-term, unsecured, dollar-denominated borrowing rate, which corresponds to an
annualized compound rate of 4%; or (ii) “another conservative rate” such as the US prime
rate plus two percentage points, which corresponds to an annualized compound rate of
5.6%.

Summary of Respondent’s Contentions

Respondent submits that the Tribunal should award no damages to Claimant because it
has failed to prove the necessary elements of its claim, including the technical and
economic feasibility of the project, and has relied on a valuation method that produces
artificially inflated results. In Respondent’s view, the real value of the project is
speculative; in any event, it does not exceed USD 149.2 million as of the valuation date.?*

On the Legal Standards Governing Claimant’s Claim for Compensation

Respondent accepts that “the proper measure of quantum is the market value of TCC on
November 15, 2011.” According to Respondent, “market value” is captured by the
compensation standard agreed by the parties to the Treaty, i.e., Article 7, which excludes

the application of a /ex generalis taken from customary international law. Respondent
notes that Article 7(2) of the Treaty requires the Tribunal to assess whether the fair market
value of Claimant’s investment is “readily ascertainable” and considers that the valuation
presented by Claimant “is as far as a method could be from rendering a ‘readily
ascertainable’ result.” Consequently, Respondent argues that pursuant to Article 7(2) of
the Treaty, the Tribunal must determine a value “in accordance with generally recognized
principles of valuation and equitable principles taking into account the capital invested,
depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement value, and other relevant

factors.”?°

Respondent submits that Claimant bears the burden of proving that the damages it alleges
are a direct consequence of the Treaty breaches and that, in order to establish causation,
it must prove that: (i) the alleged injury was caused by the wrongful act as a matter of
fact; and (ii) the loss is not too remote and speculative. Respondent argues that the
Tribunal’s finding on the existence of a Treaty breach does not discharge Claimant’s
burden of proof on causation and maintains that Claimant has failed to prove that the
amount of compensation is a direct consequence of the rejection of the Mining Lease
Application.*?

Respondent further submits that Claimant also has the burden of proof on the existence
and quantum of the damages it is seeking. It relies on its legal expert Dr. Ripinsky who
states that a “claimant must prove the losses it has incurred with reasonable, or sufficient,
certainty.” In Respondent’s view, Claimant failed to provide reasonably and sufficiently
certain information and therefore failed to discharge its burden of proof; Reko Diq “faced
key challenges that would have prevented it from becoming profitable, which requires the

Tribunal to dismiss the compensation claims.”*'

Respondent contends that the valuation method applied by Claimant’s valuation expert,
which it describes as “a rather unique variation of a discounted cash flow (‘DCF’)
valuation, which has not been adopted by the mining industry or investment tribunals,”
cannot help in determining the fair market value of Claimant’s investment as of the
valuation date. According to Respondent, the “modern DCF” method does not meet the
standard for a “readily ascertainable” market value but has been fabricated by Claimant
and its expert to “provide a designer, bespoke methodology allowing TCC to offer the

appearance of pseudo-scientific support for its predetermined outlandish valuation.”**

More generally, Respondent claims that “the weight of authority clearly indicates that, as
a general rule, the DCF method is not appropriate for investment projects that have not

demonstrated their capacity to generate profits by a track record of performance.”**

112. Respondent submits that where the market value is not “readily ascertainable,” the
Tribunal should look to a backward-looking approach. Respondent contends that its
expert Dr. Burrows derived the best approximation to the fair market value of Claimant’s
investment by using the prior transaction by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired the
shares in Claimant in 2006.**

2. On the Terms of the Mineral Agrement and the Risks and Issues Affecting the
Project

113. Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal has not made any finding that Claimant had a
legitimate expectation to conclude a Mineral Agreement and argues that there was no
specific commitment to this effect nor were the Governments under a legal obligation to
conclude a Mineral Agreement. Respondent further takes the position that “[g]iven the
lengthy history or stalled negotiations and distant positions, the most likely outcome
would be that no mineral agreement would have been agreed whatsoever.” At the same
time, Respondent contends that the absence of a finding that a Mineral Agreement would
have been concluded would render the value of Claimant’s plan to mine Reko Diq
speculative.*> As for the fiscal terms put forward by Claimant, Respondent submits that:
(i) Pakistan would not have agreed to a royalty rate below the minimum of 5% required
by law; (ii) Pakistan never agreed to grant EPZ status and Claimant abandoned this
request during negotiations; (iii) the parties “were nowhere close to agreeing to the
overall fiscal regime”; and (iv) the Governments “roundly rejected” a provision providing
for an automatic renewal of the 30-year mining lease.*°

114. Respondent further submits that in order to determine the value of the copper and gold
beneath the surface at Reko Diq, Claimant must achieve a level of certainty that it would
be able and that it would be economically feasible to turn the rock into recoverable metal.
Respondent emphasizes that if any of the issues that might arise poses a cost that is too
high for the mineral to be economically extracted, the resources cannot be classified as

anything more than inferred and do not have any economic value; they can never become

reserves.”

115. According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to show that its resource model is
trustworthy given that: (i) it has not provided an independent analysis that admitted flaws
were fixed; (ii) it did not rebut the findings of Respondent’s mining expert regarding the
flaws in the database underlying the resource model; and (iii) the method of Claimant’s

mining expert and its application are “completely unreliable.”**

116. Respondent further maintains that Claimant has not “completely sampled and tested the
deposits from a metallurgical perspective,” as the deposit is variable and not sufficiently
consistent to rely on the “limited sampling and testing” conducted by Claimant. In
particular, Respondent contends that Claimant did not sufficiently test the deposit at
depths below 450 meters and claims that Claimant’s metallurgical testing program was
insufficient to prove that the ore below that depth was metallurgically consistent with the
ore from shallower depths. In its view, “the reasonable position is to assume
metallurgical variability,” as a buyer would have done in light of the lack of testing for
the deposits.*?

117. Respondent submits that, according to Claimant, Reko Dig is a “mega project” which
would have cost almost USD 3.3 billion in capital expenditures in order to get the mine
operational. Respondent claims, however, that the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study “failed to quantify sizable costs, adopted an overly aggressive
construction schedule that did not prepare for the requirements of building a mine in
Pakistan, and adhered to overly optimistic assumptions in its construction plan and cost
estimates.” According to Respondent, the Feasibility Study was “a blueprint for another

Mega Project failure.”

118. Respondent argues that “[w]ater was a big concern for TCC’ and emphasizes that the
quantities of water needed for the construction and operation of the project would be equal
to the level of daily water consumption of approximately 500,000 people. Respondent
also points to the additional risks identified in Claimant’s Risk Register, which confirms

in its view that Claimant was aware that “the availability of and right to use water could

ol

doom the entire project.” According to Respondent, Claimant “fell far short of proving

the size of the aquifer, its plans for mitigation, and the effects of its plans on surrounding

areas and countries.” Respondent considers it confirmed that the Fan Sediments would
likely not have provided sufficient water for the project and contends that there was no
feasibility assessment and no cost estimates on transporting the water from other water
sources to Reko Dig. Respondent also submits that the solution to pump seawater to Reko
Diq was not mentioned in the Feasibility Study and adds that, in any event, this water
pipeline would have faced the same risks as the slurry pipeline to Port Gwadar.*?

119. Respondent considers it undisputed that Claimant was planning to build a mine in “one
of the most dangerous places in the world” and that the security situation in Balochistan
has worsened from 2006 to 2011 and continuing thereafter. However, Respondent
contends that Claimant “made little to no effort to identify and address the security risks
that the Reko Dig project faced, largely ignored the threat of sabotage on the pipeline,
and completely understated the costs to adequately secure the mine’s operations.”**

Respondent argues that in light of the security risks, a third-party buyer “would likely

have refrained from going forward’; however, if it had decided to proceed, it could not

have relied on Prof. Davis’ valuation model which, according to Respondent, “does not
account for the cumulative effect of attacks, the impact of security costs on the financials
of the project as management saw it in 2010-2011, and a realistic view of the insurance

market.”

120. Respondent also claims that Claimant: “(7) had no comprehensive plan to mitigate the
public’s concerns and provide benefits; (2) failed to understand the socio-political
conditions in the area and the Resource’s role in exacerbating already existing tensions;
(3) failed to sufficiently engage the affected communities or involve them in strategic
decision making during the consultation process; and (4) underestimated what it would
take to obtain a social license and maintain it.” Respondent further contends that
Claimant’s ESIA failed to conform to the IFC Performance Standards and Equator
Principles as well as to its own Environmental Design Criteria (EDC) in various areas, as
a result of which it would not have been able to seek funding and would not have been
able to obtain political risk insurance.*

121.

According to Respondent, Claimant would further have been required to show that it had
the necessary permits. By contrast, Respondent claims that “TCC did not even know all
of the permits it needed, did not appreciate the practical difficulties of operating in

Balochistan, and failed to account for the specific difficulties of getting permits for the

project.”*°

Finally, Respondent asserts that the Reko Diq project would not have been financially
feasible from a bankability perspective because there was “no financing appetite” in the
market for the Reko Dig project given the “significant flaws in the standards underlying
the IMD FS and an array of other problems that made the project not bankable.” In
addition, Respondent argues that any decision by Claimant’s owners to fund the
development of the project on an equity basis would have required them to break their
internal policies and risk their market reputation.*”

On Prof. Davis’ Adjustments for Systematic and Asymmetric Risks

Respondent takes the view that Prof. Davis has not adequately accounted for the
systematic risks in his valuation model because he has used “inordinately speculative”

projections of futures prices and even called his projections “certainty-equivalent.”
Respondent considers it “simply untenable” that a buyer would be convinced by Prof.
Davis’ explanation of “certainty-equivalent” cash flows and accept the “ridiculously low
rate return” in order to invest in a non-diversified, non-operational mining project in

Balochistan instead of purchasing the same amout in US Treasury bonds.**

Respondent contends that “[w]hen properly analyzed,” Prof. Davis’ valuation is
equivalent to applying a discount rate of merely 1.2% above the risk-free rate. According
to Respondent, Claimant has thereby ignored over 90% of the risk impact perceived by
financial markets and institutions. Respondent also refers to the discount rates of 10% to
12% used by SNC Lavalin in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which led to a value
of the project near zero. Respondent alleges that the revenues and costs projected by Prof.
Davis are very similar to those in the financial model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study, which makes it apparent that Prof. Davis made “only minor adjustments to the
cash flows” and that these cash flows are therefore no more “certainty-equivalent” than
those of SNC Lavalin. As a result, Respondent claims that there can be no justification

for the application of a risk-free discount rate to the cash flows in Prof. Davis’ model.*”

In Respondent’s view, the implied discount rate of 4.2% in Prof. Davis’ model cannot be
an adequate expression of all the risks to which the project’s cash flows would have been
exposed, in particular the country risk, which has led other tribunals to apply risk

premiums between 10% and 20% as part of the discount rate, which would render the net
present value of the cash flows estimated by Claimant negative.>°

126. Respondent submits that the only proper determination of the fair market value of
Claimant’s interest in Reko Diq has been provided by Dr. Burrows who, “following best
practices and his long forensic experience, ... identified the existence of a prior
transaction that, with some adjustments, would be the best approximation to that fair
market value,” i.e., the acquisition by Barrick of 50% in Claimant in September 2006 for
a value of USD 246 million.*! Respondent rejects the argument that Dr. Burrows failed
to account for changes in the reported resources of the property, operating costs and
mining technology between 2006 and 2011. In Respondent’s view, a comparison with
Antofagasta’s expectations as of 2006 demonstrates that “the parties had an accurate
understanding of the total mineralization of the Reko Dig project’ but that “additional
development after 2006 needed to design the mine led to negative surprises about
recovery costs.” According to Respondent, there was therefore no need for an adjustment
in Dr. Burrows’ calculation to account for an increased size of the deposit or economies
of scale.*?

127. Respondent submits that Dr. Burrows made the necessary adjustments to account for: (i)
changes in expectations about metals prices; (ii) inflation of production costs in the global
mining industry; (iii) changes in the general cost of capital for metals mines; and (iv)
changes in country risk for Pakistan, which results in a fair market value not exceeding
USD 149.2 million as of the valuation date. According to Respondent, this valuation
shows that Claimant has “artificially inflated its claim by billions of dollars, or over
98.2% of the value claimed of USD 8.5 billion.”*

4. On Pre-Award and Post-Award Interest

128. Respondent submits that under the applicable rules of international law, any interest
awarded should be simple and accrue at a risk-free rate such as the one-month US
Treasury bills. According to Respondent, any higher rate would reward Claimant for risks

to which the assets being valued were not exposed after the valuation date or “simply

contradict the applicable law.”**

VI. THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

A. Claimant’s Request for Relief

129. In its Quantum Post-Hearing Brief dated 31 August 2018, Claimant requests that the
Tribunal issue an award:°>

(i) | Ordering Pakistan to pay monetary damages in an amount that would wipe out all
the consequences of Respondent’s illegal acts, valued at USD 8.5 billion as of 15
November 2011;

(ii) | Ordering Pakistan to pay pre-award compound interest on the above amount for the
period from 15 November 2011 through the date of the award at a rate equal to
Respondent’s short-term cost of borrowing, valued at USD 2.42 billion as of 30
April 2018,°° and subject to updating closer to the date of the award;

(iii) Ordering Pakistan to pay all the costs of the arbitration and all of TCCA’s
professional fees and expenses on a full indemnity basis, in an amount to be
specified in TCCA’s application for costs with respect to the entire arbitration, to
be filed on 28 September 2018 pursuant to the Tribunal’s oral order on the last day
of the hearing;

(iv) Ordering Pakistan to pay post-award interest on all of the above amounts until full
payment of those amounts is made, at an annually compounding rate equal to
Respondent’s annualized short-term cost of borrowing, calculated as the sum of: (i)
the annualized market yield on one-month U.S. Treasury bills on the date of the
award; and (ii) the market one-year credit default swap spread on Pakistan’s
sovereign debt on that same date;

(v) Ordering Pakistan to pay the full amount due, in U.S. dollars, outside of Pakistan,
without any reduction, claim, or offset whatsoever for taxes, any other fiscal
obligation, or any other reason; and

(vi) Ordering any such further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.

B. Respondent’s Request for Relief

130. In its Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum dated 31 August 2018, Respondent requests that
the Tribunal decide as follows:°”

(ii) There is no basis to award damages with a DCF methodology;
(iii) Any damages should be no more than the 2006 transaction updated to the Valuation

(iv) Any interest should be simple and calculated on the one-month U.S. Treasury bill;
and
(v) Pakistan should receive its full costs and attorneys’ fees, update with interest.

VII. THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONING

131. At the outset of its reasoning, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully

reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties in the course of the

present phase of the proceedings concerning the consequences flowing from

Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty as well as, to the extent relevant in the present

context, the arguments and evidence adduced in the previous phases on jurisdiction and

liability and on Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims. Although the Tribunal

may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the

Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its

decision.

132. The Tribunal’s reasoning is structured as follows:

First, the Tribunal will recall the main findings it has made in the Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability which it deems relevant to its assessment of the Parties’
arguments raised in this last phase of the proceedings. The Tribunal will also refer
to the findings it has made in its Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration
Request and make certain general remarks on the development of Respondent’s
position regarding the feasibility of Claimant’s project at Reko Dig.

Second, the Tribunal will determine the relevant legal standards governing
Claimant’s claim for compensation. As part of this assessment, the Tribunal will
address: (i) the applicable standard of compensation; (ii) the requirement of
causation between Respondent’s Treaty breaches and the damages alleged by
Claimant; (iii) the standard and burden of proof that apply to ascertaining the
feasibility of the project and the value of Claimant’s investment; and (iv) the
appropriate valuation method to determine the value of Claimant’s investment and

(iv), the Tribunal will address the different valuation methods used by the Parties’
valuation experts and examine whether Claimant has established, in principle, that
it is appropriate to determine the damages it has incurred based on the valuation
method relied on by its valuation expert, Prof. Davis.

e = Third, once the Tribunal has determined the relevant legal standards, it will assess
whether Claimant has established that it would have concluded a Mineral
Agreement with the Federal and Provincial Governments and, if so, the terms on
which such an agreement would likely have been concluded. The Tribunal will
further examine whether Claimant has established the feasibility of the project and
address the various risks and issues raised by Respondent in this last phase of the
arbitration proceedings. Provided that the Tribunal decides, in principle, to follow
the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, it will also assess whether Prof.
Davis has appropriately accounted for each of these risks in his valuation of the
project.

e Fourth, and again provided that the Tribunal decides, in principle, to follow the
valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal will assess whether he has
appropriately accounted for all relevant systematic and asymmetric risks affecting
the project.

e Fifth, the Tribunal will verify whether the conclusion it has reached on the amount
of damages incurred based on the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis is
reconcilable with the results yielded by other valuation or evaluation methods
relied on by Respondent’s experts in this arbitration or contemporaneously
applied by TCCA.

e Finally, the Tribunal will address Claimant’s request for an award of pre-award
and post-award interest on the amount of compensation owed to it by Respondent.

Relevant Findings Made by the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction and
Liability and the Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request

At the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal will: (i) recall the main findings it has made in
the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability which it deems relevant to its assessment of the
Parties’ arguments raised in this last phase of the proceedings; (ii) refer to the findings it
has made in its Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request; and (iii) make certain
general remarks on the development of Respondent’s position regarding the feasibility of
Claimant’s project at Reko Diq.

Findings Made in the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability

As part of its analysis of Respondent’s jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal held that
Claimant had an “investment” within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, which
consisted of the following:
“Claimant's activities in Pakistan were primarily based on two pillars: (i)
TCCA's own direct 75% interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture that
was thereby established; and (ii) its 100% interest in its Pakistani subsidiary
TCCP, which was established for the exclusive purpose of carrying out

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -44-

Claimant's activities in Pakistan. Through TCCP, Claimant indirectly held
all further rights in the Reko Dig Project that were not held by the Joint
Venture.”°*

135. The Tribunal held that these two pillars constitute “assets,” which were “owned or
controlled” by TCCA and were “admitted by [Pakistan] subject to its law and investment
policies” applicable at the time the investment was made.*?

136. On that basis, the Tribunal made the following findings on liability.

a. Respondent Has Breached Article 3(2) of the Treaty

137. First, the Tribunal found that Respondent has failed to accord Claimant fair and equitable
treatment in violation of its obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.

138. The Tribunal held that the protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations is an
important element of the FET standard under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.® Based on a
thorough analysis of the Parties’ submissions and the evidence in the record, the Tribunal
concluded with regard to the scope of legitimate expectations created by Respondent:

“In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that by means of both the contractual and
the regulatory framework of Claimant's investment as well as the conduct of
the GOB and the GOP during the time period in which Claimant explored the
area at Reko Dig, Respondent created the legitimate expectation that
Claimant would be entitled to a mining lease upon submission of an
application that met the routine requirements as set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the
2002 BM Rules. Even though these requirements contained certain
discretionary elements, the Governments created the impression that such
discretion had either already been exercised or that it would be exercised in
Claimant's favor because they recognized the general principle that, after
having invested millions of dollars into the exploration of the area, Claimant
should also be the one that would later reap the benefit of its exploitation
together with its Joint Venture partner. Finally, both the GOB and the GOP
repeatedly assured Claimant that they would support and_ facilitate
Claimant's investment.”®!

139. Specifically, with regard to the role assumed by the GOB in this context, the Tribunal
held:

“Pursuant to these provisions [i.e., Clauses 7.2a), 5.7.1, 5.7.2, 24.6.2 and
24.6.3 of the CHEJVA], the GOB was under an obligation to provide
administrative support in procuring the required licenses and permits and to
perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and

the interests of the Joint Venture as a whole, i.e., to the exploration and
exploitation of the mineral resources at Reko Dig. It is undisputed between
the Parties that the GOB did provide such support for, and thus facilitated,
Claimant's investment over a period of many years, including the time period
in which the 2006 Novation Agreement was signed.”

140. The Tribunal then examined whether Respondent breached the legitimate expectations it
had created and, based on a thorough analysis of the evidentiary record regarding, in
particular, the GOB project at Reko Diq, found that there “is sufficient evidence that
mining activities formed part of the GOB's project and that the GOB thus did not intend
to implement a complementary processing project, but rather a competing mining and
processing project (albeit at a smaller scale) that was not compatible with Claimant's
project.”® The press coverage in 2010 reinforced the Tribunal’s conclusion that “that the
GOB had decided to take over the project and, accordingly, to deny TCCP's Mining Lease
Application.”

141.

This conclusion was not, however, sufficient for a finding that Respondent breached its
FET obligation because there might have been, at the same time, legitimate reasons for
denying the Mining Lease Application submitted by TCCP to the Licensing Authority on
15 February 2011.° Consequently, the Tribunal examined each of the ten grounds stated
in the Licensing Authority’s notice of its intent to reject the Mining Lease Application
dated 21 September 2011 (the “Notice of Intent to Reject”).© The Parties had grouped
those grounds into three sets of grounds, i.e.: (i) that TCCP was not the proper applicant;
(ii) that the Feasibility Study, which formed part of the Mining Lease Application, did
not provide for processing, smelting and refining of the ore; and (iii) that TCCP failed to
submit a proper/complete feasibility study on the discovered deposits in the exploration
area. For the reasons set out in detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the
Tribunal concluded that “none of the reasons given in the Notice of Intent to Reject could

have justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application.”®’

142. In the first phase of the arbitration proceedings, Respondent further raised four additional
grounds which, in its view, justified the Licensing Authority’s denial of the Mining Lease
Application, i.e.: (i) that TCCP failed to prove that the mine could be profitably developed
and operated; (ii) that TCCP failed to establish that it had or could obtain the resources to
carry out the mining operations effectively; (iii) that TCCP failed to adequately address

the security risks of the pipeline; and (iv) that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source
for the project.

With regard to these reasons, the Tribunal first held:

“Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those
invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject because Respondent would thereby
be allowed to ignore the procedural requirements set out in rule 48(4) and
(5) of the 2002 BM Rules and, more generally, this would violate Claimant's
right to be heard both during the procedure before the Licensing Authority
and the appeal before the Secretary of the MMDD.”®

In any event, the Tribunal considered that “none of the additional reasons invoked by
Respondent would justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application in the present

case.”

As certain findings made by the Tribunal in the context of these additional grounds are
particularly relevant to the arguments raised by Respondent in this last phase of the
proceedings, the Tribunal considers it worth recalling these reasons in more detail at this
point.

i. Respondent’s Allegation That TCCP Failed to Prove that the Mine
Could Be Profitably Developed and Operated

In the context of the first additional ground, i.e., that Claimant failed to demonstrate in
the Feasibility Study “that the mine can be profitably developed and operated” as required
under rule 48(3)(a)(i) of the Mineral Rules enacted by Balochistan in 2002 to implement
the National Mineral Policy (“2002 BM Rules”),”' the Tribunal recalled, inter alia, the
oral testimony of Antofagasta’s chairman Mr. Luksic who explained that “[e]ven if you
have a start that is tight, your expansions are going to be extremely, extremely
profitable”? and held:

“In light of this undisputed testimony and further taking into account the fact
that two of the world’s largest mining companies were willing to invest large
amounts of equity into this project, the Tribunal considers it sufficiently
established that the mining project as envisaged by Claimant, i.e., consisting
of the initial mine development set out in the Feasibility Study and the
expansions set out in the Pre-Feasibility Expansion Study, could be
‘profitably developed and operated’ as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i) of the
2002 BM Rules.””*

147. While taking note of the fact that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study did not form part
of the Mining Lease Application and thus was not among the documents considered by
the Licensing Authority, the Tribunal added:

“In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that
the initial mine development as presented in the Feasibility Study would have
been unprofitable. While Respondent focused its argument primarily on the
allegation that Claimant made wrong assumptions with regard to the tax and
royalty regime, Claimant’s witness Mr. Livesey explained during the Hearing
that the profitability was much more sensitive to the prices of fuel and metals,
in particular copper, and further stated that in light of the subsequent rise of
the copper prices after the completion of the Feasibility Study, the
profitability had increased ‘into high teens to twenties IRR even in the normal
tax regime.’ This is reflected in the sensitivity analysis on metal prices
conducted in Chapters 28.3.1 and 28.3.2 of the Feasibility Study, which
further includes the statement that a ‘conservative base copper price’ was
selected for this analysis.”™

148. Finally, the Tribunal considered Respondent’s argument that Claimant had made wrong
assumptions regarding the tax and royalty regime:

“(T]he Tribunal notes that the applicable tax and royalty rates were still
subject to the Mineral Agreement negotiations. While such negotiations had
apparently stalled before the Mining Lease Application was filed, the parties
may well have decided to revive them after the grant of the mining lease, given
that Claimant would then have been the only one allowed to conduct mining
operations in the area. There would thus have been a mutual interest to
achieve agreement on the remaining issues. In the Tribunal’s view, Claimant
would have been in a far better bargaining position as holder of the mining
lease over the area than it was before, in particular once it became clear that
the Governments considered that Claimant did not have a right to convert its
exploration license into a mining lease. Therefore, the Tribunal is not
convinced that Claimant made unrealistic assumptions in the absence of
which the project would have been unprofitable without any future
expansions.”

with regard to Table 28.20 entitled “Impact of Price on IRR,” Mr. Livesey further explained that “if you were to
take today’s prices on copper and gold, you would actually be off the chart another block to the right, down on
that bottom line, and your IRR would be somewhat close to 20 percent.” Transcript Hearing on Jurisdiction and

ii. Respondent’s Allegation That TCCP Failed to Establish That It Had or
Could Obtain the Resources to Carry Out the Mining Operations
Effectively

149. As to the second additional reason that Respondent invoked for the first time in these
arbitration proceedings, i.e., that TCCP failed to demonstrate that it had or could obtain
the “technical and financial resources and experience to carry out mining operations
effectively” as required under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules,”° the Tribunal again
referred, inter alia, to Mr. Luksic’s testimony that Claimant’s shareholders had had
meetings with the World Bank but “you need to have a fully approved project before you
get the financing.” He also stated that “the World Bank seemed very committed. ... [T]hey
were very committed to Pakistan developing mining. It had a special man in charge of a
mining program, and they were very committed.”” The Tribunal then held:

“In light of this testimony and again taking into account that Antofagasta and
Barrick Gold as two of the world’s largest mining companies were willing to
contribute large amounts of equity to the project, it appears improbable that
they would not have been able to obtain third-party financing from financial
institutions, such as the World Bank and/or the Asian Development Bank. In
the Tribunal's view, the absence of a Mineral Agreement might have made
such financing more challenging, but there was no indication that it would
have been impossible.””*

iii. Respondent’s Allegation That TCCP Failed to Adequately Address the
Security Risks of the Pipeline

150. With regard to the third additional reason, i.e., that TCCP failed to adequately address the
security risks associated with transporting the concentrate via pipeline to the Port of
Gwadar, the Tribunal referred to Mr. Livesey’s testimony on the issue as well as the fact
that “the Feasibility Study contained separate sections on both security and risk, which
identified certain issues and set out the strategies to address them.”” The Tribunal took
note of the fact that “it is also stated in the chapter on asset evaluation that certain
‘residual risks,’ including security risks, were identified the value of which was not
included in the economic evaluation of the project,” but the Tribunal did “not agree with
Respondent that TCCP therefore failed to adequately address security risks.”*° It held:

“The same section cited by Respondent states that such risks ‘will require
further mitigation attention during the subsequent stages.’ In the Tribunal’s

16 Exhibit RE-1, rule 48(3)(a)(iii).

view, it is plausible that not all risks can be fully assessed and quantified at
such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy evolves
over time and the further development of the project. Therefore, the Tribunal
sees no reason to assume a failure on the part of TCCP to adequately address
security risks in the Feasibility Study.”*!

151. The Tribunal further noted that, as emphasized by Mr. Livesey, “at no point until the
rejection of the Mining Lease Application did the GOB raise any concerns and that, in
fact, the pipeline was not even mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject. He concluded
that ‘I don’t see why this is all of a sudden become a significant issue.’”** The Tribunal
added:

“(T]he GOB had known about the option to transport the concentrate by
means of a slurry pipeline since December 2007 when Claimant presented
the transport options as part of its Mineral Agreement Proposals to the
Governments in Dubai. While the GOB did express its interest in having built
a road to Gwadar in order to improve the infrastructure of the region, there
is no indication in the record that it ever raised any security concerns with
regard to the pipeline option. Respondent’s witness Mr. Yaqoob confirmed
during the Hearing that ‘there was no official discussion with the
Government of Balochistan on security issues’ and further that, to his
knowledge, there was also no internal discussion between the Licensing
Authority and the GOB.

Further taking into account the fact that the pipeline as such, let alone the
allegedly ignored security risks, were not mentioned in the Notice of Intent to
Reject, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that this additional reason
invoked by Respondent in this arbitration played any role in the decision-
making process of the Licensing Authority at the relevant time.”**

iv. Respondent’s Allegation That TCCP Failed to Fully Assess the Water
Source for its Project

152. Finally, the Tribunal turned to the fourth additional reason invoked by Respondent, i.e.,
that TCCP failed to assess the water source that it intended to use for its project to full
feasibility level. Based on the evidence in the record, it appeared to the Tribunal that, “as
far as the Pakistani side of the acquifer is concerned, it is undisputed that Claimant did
make a full feasibility assessment of the groundwater source that it intended to use for
the project, i.e., the Baghicha Bore Field.”** The Tribunal further relied on Mr. Livesey’ s
witness testimony regarding the flow of water from Pakistan into Afghanistan as well as

the fact that Claimant maintained licenses to the other areas with potential water sources
and also noted that the GOB had chosen the same water source for its own mining
project.®> It concluded:

“Based on this record, the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant did in fact
make an adequate assessment of the groundwater source it intended to use
for its project so that Respondent’s fourth additional reason also does not
present a justifiable basis for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application.”*°

y. Conclusion on Respondent’s Breach of Article 3(2) of the Treaty

153. In its overall conclusion on its assessment of whether Respondent breached Article 3(2)
of the Treaty, the Tribunal summarized its findings as follows:

“In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that none of the reasons invoked in the
Notice of Intent to Reject and/or in this arbitration justified the Licensing
Authority’s decision to deny TCCP’s Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal
is convinced that the real motive for the denial was the fact that the GOB had
decided to develop and implement its own mining project rather than to
collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that the grounds
invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this
motive. The Tribunal recalls that Respondent had created legitimate
expectations on Claimant's part that it would be entitled to convert its
exploration license into a mining lease ‘subject only to compliance with
routine Government requirements.’ Given that Claimant in fact fulfilled all
of the requirements under rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules in its Mining Lease
Application, Respondent’s denial, motivated by its desire to mine the area on
its own, violated Claimant’s legitimate expectations and thereby breached the
FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.”*’

154. Asa result of this finding, the Tribunal did not have to express an opinion as to whether
the Governments’ conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations amounted to a breach
of the FET standard.**

b. Respondent Has Breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty

155. Second, the Tribunal found that Respondent has carried out a measure having effect
equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a lawful
expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty.

in the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement dated 29 July 1993
(“CHEJVA”) and the unincorporated contractual joint venture established under the
CHEJVA (“Joint Venture”) or its 100% interest in TCCP and thus no direct
expropriation.*? However, the Tribunal held:

“(T]he sole purpose of the Joint Venture under the CHEJVA and, likewise, of
TCCP was to carry out the exploration and eventual mining operations at
Reko Dig. After Claimant had spent more than US$ 240 million on its
exploration work and had completed its Feasibility Study on the Initial Mine
Development of the area, TCCP filed an application for a mining lease, which
would have allowed Claimant to amortize the expenditures it had incurred
during the exploration period. By denying TCCP’s Mining Lease Application,
however, the Licensing Authority rendered it impossible for Claimant to make
use of the information and data it had collected and thereby also rendered
Claimant’s interest in both the CHEJVA and in TCCP useless. Without a
mining lease, neither of them could any longer fulfill their exclusive purpose,
after the exploration had been completed; thus, following the denial of
TCCP’s Application, the value of both the CHEJVA and TCCP was effectively
neutralized.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the denial of TCCP’s Mining Lease
Application was a measure having an effect equivalent to expropriation.”

The Tribunal considered that the GOB’s motivation, i.e., to deny the Mining Lease
Application because it had decided to implement its own project rather than to continue
its collaboration with Claimant, also excluded the classification of the denial as a bona
fide regulatory measure.*!

In terms of legality of the expropriatory measure, the Tribunal considered it common
ground that the expropriation was not accompanied by the payment of “prompt, adequate
and effective” compensation.°* Given the GOB’s desire to implement its own project
rather than to continue collaborating with Claimant, it further held:

“Apart from the fact that this finding renders it questionable whether the
expropriatory measure served a public purpose, the Tribunal in any event
considers that the denial was discriminatory because it favored the GOB’s
local project over the project of a foreign company.”??

It concluded that “Respondent has not complied with (at least) two out of four Treaty

requirements and therefore breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty.”**

c. Respondent Has Breached Article 3(3) of the Treaty

Third, the Tribunal found that Respondent has impaired the use of Claimant’s investment
in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

In addition to the conduct leading the Tribunal’s finding on a breach of the FET standard,
Claimant invoked several additional actions of Balochistan which, in its view, had also

1.95

impaired its investment.” The Tribunal did not consider it necessary to assess each of

these actions by themselves but held:

“[I]f considered together with the denial of the Mining Lease Application,
Respondent’s conduct clearly impaired, if not prevented altogether, the use
of Claimant's investment. By denying TCCP’s Mining Lease Application,
Respondent prevented Claimant from making any use of its exploration work
and of any possibility to amortize its expenditures — much less to realize the
benefit of its investment. Given that both the Joint Venture in which Claimant
had a 75% interest and Claimant’s subsidiary TCCP were established for the
sole purpose of carrying out the exploration and, ultimately, the mining
operations at Reko Dig, Claimant’s investment was rendered useless when
the Mining Lease Application was denied.”°®

The Tribunal held that several of the additional actions invoked by Claimant, i-e.: (i)
Balochistan’s change of position in the Supreme Court proceedings in early 2011; (ii) the
GOB’s decision to start denying administrative clearances for TCC’s expatriate staff,
three days after its own project had been approved and on the same day that the Mines &
Mineral Development Department took over as the GOB’s representative on the
Operating Committee; (iii) Balochistan’s use of Claimant’s exploration data for its own
project; and (iv) the decision of the Balochistan Cabinet on 24 December 2009 “not to go
ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with TCCP,”*” together
with the Tribunal’s impression from the record that no actual negotiations took place after
this decision, supported its previous findings.°* It concluded:

“[A]s confirmed by the above mentioned actions, the denial of the Mining

Lease Application impaired the use of Claimant’s investment. The Tribunal

is further convinced that Respondent’s measures were motivated by the desire

to implement its own project — without having a justified ground for denying

the Mining Lease Application. Therefore, the measures were also ‘arbitrary,

unreasonable and discriminatory’ and thus fulfill even the stricter standard of

protection that has been advanced by Respondent.”°?

100 Decision on Jurisdi

d. Final Remark on Causation

As a final remark on Respondent’s argument on causation, the Tribunal held:

“While the Tribunal is aware that Respondent has further raised the argument
that Claimant’s claim must fail in limine because it has failed to address
causation, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to state at this point that
Respondent’s conduct deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and
thereby directly caused a loss that is to be quantified at a later stage of the
proceedings. In the Tribunal’s view, any specific questions on whether
Respondent's conduct was causal for individual parts of Claimant’s — yet
unquantified — claim cannot be dealt with in the abstract but will be addressed
as part of the quantum phase of the proceedings.”'°

Findings Made in the Tribunal’s Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request

The Tribunal further recalls that in the course of this last phase of the proceedings, i.e.,
on 6 November 2017, Respondent filed a request for reconsideration of the Tribunal’ s
findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Specifically, Respondent argued
that it had recently discovered evidence that, in its view, undermined Claimant’s claims
regarding the results of the drilling for water and the metallurgical drilling. It requested
that the Tribunal reconsider its (Draft) Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and find that
there was “insufficient water and_ significant uncertainties regarding mineral
recoverabilities that prohibit any award finding that TCCA should have received a mining

lease.”

In its Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request, the Tribunal found that it had
the power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability within a certain scope
and limits, in particular taking guidance from the requirements of Article 51 of the ICSID
Convention.'°? On that basis, the decisive question for the Tribunal to determine was
whether the allegedly newly discovered facts presented by Respondent were “of such a

nature as decisively to affect the pre-award decision.” !°

In its Reconsideration Request, Respondent argued that certain findings made by the
Tribunal in the context of the ground invoked by the Licensing Authority that TCCP
failed to submit a proper/complete Feasibility Study on the discovered deposits in the
Exploration Area (referred to as the third set of grounds) as well as in the context of the
additional grounds invoked by Respondent in these proceedings, i.e., that TCCP failed to
prove that the mine could be profitably developed and operated, and that TCCP failed to

assess the water source that it intended to use for its project to full feasibility level.!°

Respondent presented two sets of allegedly new facts: (i) the results of studies performed
by Claimant’s water consultant SMEC, which, according to Respondent and its experts
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Nanni, do not support the conclusion drawn by Claimant in the
Feasibility Study regarding the size of the Fan Sediments aquifer and the amount of water
available; and (ii) the metallurgical sampling and testing performed by Claimant’s
consultant Ammtec, which, according to Respondent and its experts Prof. Dagdelen and

Mr. Owen, was done improperly and yielded compromised results. !°°

167. The Tribunal analyzed both sets of allegedly new facts.

a. Respondent’s Allegation That the Results of the Drilling for Water Merit
Reconsideration

168. The Tribunal first assessed Respondent’s allegation that the results of the drilling for
water merit reconsideration because it had allegedly identified an error in the Feasibility
Study regarding the storage coefficient of the water source chosen by Claimant. It held
that, even if this allegation were to be proven through further written submissions on the
merits, it could not have a decisive, or outcome-determinative, impact on the Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability.!°° The Tribunal noted:

“Respondent does not allege that the alleged error it has identified in the
Feasibility Study was known to the Licensing Authority at the time it rejected
TCCP’s Mining Lease Application and/or that it formed part of either of the
ten grounds invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject. It rather argues that
‘[r]egardless of the text of the reasons to deny the mining lease application, a
fatally flawed IMD FS cannot create a mining lease application.’”!

169. Recalling its finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that “Respondent should
not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to
Reject,” the Tribunal concluded that “a potential error in the Feasibility Study that was
not known to the Licensing Authority in November 2011 cannot decisively affect the
Tribunal’s conclusion that the denial of the Mining Lease Application was not justified
by any of the reasons that the Licensing Authority invoked and that ‘the real motive for
the denial was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own
mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that
the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this

motive.’”!°8

The Tribunal then emphasized the following:

“[C]ontrary to what Respondent’s submission appears to suggest, it did not
make a finding that the Feasibility Study was complete and/or that all
assumptions and conclusions presented in the Study were fully accurate.
What the Tribunal did find was that none of the reasons invoked by the
Licensing Authority and, albeit it would not have been strictly necessary for
its liability finding, none of the additional reasons invoked by Respondent in
the liability phase, justified a denial of the Mining Lease Application. The
question whether the assumptions made in the Feasibility Study were
adequate and realistic will become relevant in the present quantum phase for
the purposes of assessing the amount of damages to which Claimant is
entitled as a result of Respondent’s Treaty breach. However, the error alleged
by Respondent, even if true, will not affect the Tribunal’s finding that there
was such a Treaty breach, i.e., that the grounds invoked by the Licensing
Authority at the time served only as a pretext to conceal the GOB’s real
motive to take over Reko Dig and develop its own project instead of
collaborating with Claimant.”

As to the alleged errors identified by Respondent, the Tribunal noted that neither Party
had presented any opinions from independent experts in the liability phase and that “[a]s
Respondent’s reference to its experts Mr. Holmes and [Dr.] Nanni shows, it was
apparently only through their review of the relevant data that the alleged errors were
detected. Consequently, the Tribunal will assess the arguments presented by Respondent
with regard to the water issue in its analysis on quantum once the Parties have completed
their written submissions and the Tribunal has heard the fact and expert witnesses during
the hearing on quantum on this issue.”''®

b. Respondent’s Allegation That the Results of the Metallurgical Drilling Merit

Reconsideration

The Tribunal then analyzed Respondent’s allegation that the results of the metallurgical
drilling merits reconsideration because Claimant allegedly failed to adequately sample
rock from below 450 meters in depth and because the testing was allegedly done
improperly and yielded poor recoverability results. Similarly to its analysis of the first
allegation, the Tribunal again noted that “Respondent does not argue that the alleged
absence of proper metallurgy sampling and testing was known to the Licensing Authority
at the time it rejected the Mining Lease Application. As a result, the Tribunal’s finding
that Respondent should not be allowed to rely on any additional reasons in this

arbitration in order to avoid liability under the Treaty applies with equal force.”""'

173. The Tribunal further did not agree that Respondent’s allegation regarding metallurgical
sampling and testing affected its findings on liability. It emphasized that it had not yet
made any findings on metallurgical sampling or testing and/or whether the assumptions
made in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study were realistic and reflected the true value of
the Reko Dig project at the time.!!? It concluded:

“Similarly to the water issue, neither of the Parties presented any opinions
from independent experts on metallurgy in the liability phase as they have
now done in the quantum phase. Respondent again primarily refers to the
testimony of its experts, in this case Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen, who
reviewed the relevant data and detected the alleged errors. Once the Parties
have completed their written submissions and the Tribunal has heard the fact
and expert witnesses during the hearing on quantum, the Tribunal will make
a finding on this issue if and to the extent it becomes relevant to determine
the amount of damages to which Claimant is entitled as aresult of
Respondent’s Treaty breach that the Tribunal has determined in its Decision
on Jurisdiction and Liability"!

c. Final Remark on the Scope of Its Decision

174. Asa final remark, the Tribunal emphasized:

“[I]n line with the scope of the present decision, its findings on the alleged
facts presented by Respondent are limited to the relevance, or rather the lack
of relevance, of these alleged facts to the Tribunal’s findings on jurisdiction
and liability. The present decision is therefore without prejudice to any future
findings that the Tribunal may make in relation to the issues raised by
Respondent in the course of the quantum phase of this arbitration for the
purposes of determining the amount of damages to which Claimant is entitled
as a result of Respondent's breach of the Treaty.”''*

3. | Remarks on the Development of Respondent’s Position Regarding the Feasibility of
Claimant’s Project

175. Asa further preliminary point to be made regarding Respondent’s allegation that the risks
and issues to which it has pointed in this last phase of the proceedings render the project
unfeasible, the Tribunal notes that this allegation stands in rather stark contrast to the
position its officers expressed during the time period in which the GOB was still
collaborating with Claimant on the project and the position taken by Respondent and the
evidence on which it relied at the beginning of this arbitration.

Respondent's Response to Claimant’s Request for Provisi
116 Respondent’s Rejoinder on Claimant’ s Request for Pri

Measures, which concerned the Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project initiated by the GOB,
that “Claimant is right to categorise the RekoDiq deposits as of huge economic
importance”''> and that “Claimant’s conduct can be interpreted as a deliberate attempt
to conceal the extent of the mineral deposits in the Reko Dig Mining Area.”''® According
to Respondent, “Claimant was actively downplaying its economics before the
Governments” when referring to the project being “relatively skinny in economic terms,
pointing out the estimated 13% IRR, too low for any Pakistani business house to invest in

the project.”'"7

In these submissions, Respondent placed particular reliance on the first witness statement
from Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, who served as member (Science & Technology) of the
Planning Commission and prepared, inter alia, a technical feasibility of the GOB’s Reko
Dig project in the Planning Commission.!!* Dr. Mubarakmand stated that he had received
a copy of the Feasibility Study before he had to make a statement before the Supreme
Court of Pakistan.'!? During the Hearing on Claimant’s Request for Provisional
Measures, he confirmed that he “looked at all the relevant parts in detail” and that he
“had a good look at” the Feasibility Study before making that statement.!”°

In his statement before the Supreme Court, Dr. Mubarakmand noted that the value of the
deposit H-15 which Claimant planned to develop was reported in the Feasibility Study to
be USD 104 billion and added that most of the copper was in other deposits such as H-
14, H-13, H-8 and H-27, which he referred to “huge deposits of high concentration
Copper Ore.” In his view, it was “likely that the real deposits in EL-5 area are much
more than the value of $104 billion as indicated by TCC’s Feasibility Study.” As for gold,
Dr. Mubarakmand similarly stated that “[h]ere again the total deposits of Gold in EL-5

have not been revealed in TCC’s Feasibility Study.”'?!

Dr. Mubarakmand then referred to the GOB’s own Reko Dig project, which was intended
to start with process 15,000 tons per day “but as the mine grows wider and deeper with
time, more ore is expected per day and therefore every 5-6 years the size of the plant is
enhanced.” Assuming a processing of 110,000 tons of ore per day, for comparison with
Claimant’s project, Dr. Mubarakmand estimated a profit of USD 2,354 million per year
or a total of USD 131,824 billion over the life of the mine.!?? According to Dr.

Mubarakman, “the Feasibility Study submitted by TCC is just the tip of the ice berg in the
EL-5 area.”'8

In his first witness statement, Dr. Mubarakmand confirmed his opinion that “the value of
the gold and copper in the exploration area was vastly greater than the value in area H-
15.”!*4 He further explained that he decided to develop the GOB’s project on H-4, inter
alia, because “at the outset H-4 was a better place to mine for technical reasons. H-14
and H-15 have an overburden of 140 metres of rock, which means that rock to this depth
has to be removed before mining of the copper mineral can begin. The overburden of H-
4 on the other hand is 40 metres, which means it is easier to get to the copper mineral
underneath. Further, the mineral at H-14 and H-15 is copper sulphide ore, whereas the
mineral at H-4 is copper oxide ore. The refining process for copper sulphide ore takes
longer and is more expensive than the refining process for copper oxide ore, which is

simpler and less energy intensive.”

The Tribunal notes that Dr. Mubarakmand did not express any doubts, neither in his
statement before the Supreme Court nor in his witness testimony before this Tribunal,
that the project envisaged by Claimant was technically and economically feasible. To the
contrary, he believed that a mining project at Reko Diq could be commercially much
more attractive than reported by Claimant. During the Hearing on Claimant’s Request for
Provisional Measures, Dr. Mubarakmand affirmed that it was his testimony that the
Feasibility Study was part of a “ruse in order to defraud the Government of Balochistan
from the real extent of minerals that TCC had presented on its website in 2006.”'°
Respondent also alleged that Claimant was “conceal[ing] the extent of the mineral
deposits in the Reko Dig Mining Area” and “actively downplaying its economics before

the Governments.” 77

The Tribunal further recalls that while Respondent now points to numerous allegedly
critical issues that rendered the project unfeasible, neither of these issues was raised by
the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject. Based on the record of these
proceedings, the Tribunal is also not aware that any other agency or official of the GOB
or the GOP raised these issues during the time period in which the joint venture partners
were still collaborating or even when the GOB had decided to to take over the project and
deny TCCP’s Mining Lease Application in violation of Respondent’s obligations under
the Treaty. As the Tribunal found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, it was only
during these arbitration proceedings that Respondent started to invoke additional grounds

such as an alleged failure to establish the profitability of the planned mine and the ability
to obtain financing, security risks regarding the pipeline, and a failure to fully assess the
water source.

183. In this last phase of the proceedings, Respondent has further raised the argument that
Claimant’s shareholders, Antofagasta and Barrick, “did not have the relevant experience,
track record, and personnel to make the project successful” and that their participation

on this project would therefore have been “more of a liability than benefit.”!?

184. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the GOB itself stated in its submission to the
Balochistan High Court in 2007 that “Antofagasta of Chile, one of the largest copper
producers in the world and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada, the number one gold
producer in the world” purchased Claimant’s shares in 2006 and that “[b]oth the Federal
and Provincial Governments have appreciated and welcomed two big giants from mining
industry in Pakistan.”'”° The GOB further stated:

“Tt is specifically denied that any company has been associated with the
project with ‘zero mining experience and zero financial standing’. It is
submitted that the worlds largest copper and gold mining companies have
been brought forward to fund the project which is excellent news and will
expedite exploration and extraction enabling the Province of Balochistan to
make windfall profits.”'>°

185. In a memorandum to the Balochistan’s Chief Secretary dated 31 December 2009, the
Secretary of the Mines & Mineral Development Department commented that “[m]ining
is one of the most difficult activities to be carried out requiring huge amount of
investment, rich expertise and skills, and very careful planning and proper management
to make it a success.” He further commented that TCCP had “done tremendous efforts in
discovering and explring the Reko-Diq Copper & Gold prospects” and that “[t]he way of
working and performance reflect that their attitude is serious and they are committed to
develop the project. They appear professional businessmen with the required will,

resources and rich expertise in developing such kind of resources.”'*!

186. Against this background, it strongly appears to the Tribunal that Respondent’s allegation
that Barrick and Antofagasta lacked the relevant experience to build and operate the mine
at Reko Diq!*? has been created post-hoc for these arbitration proceedings. While
Respondent may have correctly pointed out that Antofagasta had never operated a mine
outside of Chile and that Barrick was not operating copper mines itself as of 2006,'*? it is

apparent that both companies decided in 2006 to become 50% (indirect) shareholders in
TCCA and to combine their respective experience in the mining sector. Whereas
Antofagasta brought experience in building and operating copper mines, Barrick
contributed experience in operating gold mines in several countries with difficult
conditions across the globe. Accordingly, contemporaneous statements of the GOB
clearly indicate that the participation of Antofagasta and Barrick was considered a
significant benefit to the project.

The Tribunal further cannot follow Respondent’s criticism that Mr. Livesey, who was
leading the preparation of the Feasibility Study, had not managed a feasibility study
before. Mr. Livesey explained that before he became Project Director in late 2006, he had
worked in the Tethyan belt for four years and before that on the Zambian copper belt for
two years and on polymetallic nickel-copper belts in South Africa.'** In addition, Mr.
Livesey testified that his team consisted not only of Tethyan staff who were seconded or
recruited into Tethyan but “for each main discipline [had] oversight from both owners,
Barrick and Antofagasta.” He further explained that he reported to a technical committee
which consisted of representatives from both Barrick and Antofagasta with the

chairmanship alternating between the two.!?>

For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal will certainly not brush off any of the concerns
and issues raised by Respondent but will nevertheless assess each of them in detail and
determine whether they have an impact on the feasibility of the project and/or the value
of Claimant’s investment. However, the Tribunal considers that it must also be taken into
account in this assessment that neither of these issues was raised by the Governments at
the time and that it therefore cannot help the impression that some of these allegedly
critical issues were invoked only as a defense in these arbitration proceedings.

Legal Standards Governing Claimant’s Claim for Compensation

The Tribunal will now determine the relevant legal standards governing Claimant’s claim
for compensation. As pointed out by Claimant,'* the Parties are in disagreement on four
issues, which the Tribunal will address in turn: (i) the applicable standard of
compensation; (ii) the requirement of causation between Respondent’s Treaty breaches
and the damages alleged by Claimant; (iii) the standard and burden of proof that apply to
ascertaining the feasibility of the project and the value of Claimant’s investment; and (iv)
the appropriate valuation method to determine the value of Claimant’s investment and the
corresponding compensation to which Claimant is entitled. In the context of (iv), the
Tribunal will address the different valuation methods used by the Parties’ valuation

experts and determine whether Claimant has established, in principle, that it is appropriate
to determine the damages it has incurred based on the valuation method relied on by its
valuation expert, Prof. Davis.

Summary of Claimant’s Position

a. Standard of Compensation

Claimant submits that there is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal must
award compensation equal to the “market value” of Claimant’s investment as of 15
November 2011 and that in assessing that value, it must disregard all of the unlawful acts

that Respondent has committed prior to that valuation date.!*7

Claimant argues that the Australia-Pakistan BIT does not specify the remedies for
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty. In Claimant’s view, the Tribunal must therefore
apply the standard of full reparation under customary international law, as established in
Chorz6w Factory: the award “must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of
the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed
if that acted had not been committed.”'*

Claimant submits that the Chorzéw Factory standard is widely understood as the
prevailing compensation standard for breaches of international law and is also reflected
in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts
(“ILC Articles”), which impose an obligation on States to “make full reparation” for

injuries caused by internationally wrongful acts.'°?

In Claimant’s view, this standard is particularly appropriate in this case as Respondent
rejected Claimant’s initial request for specific performance and thereby rendered
restitution in kind impossible. Claimant contends that the Tribunal must therefore award

“a sum corresponding to the value which [such] restitution in kind would bear.”'*°

Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal should apply what Claimant
refers to as “the compensation condition” in Article 7 of the Treaty. According to
Claimant, “the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation” is only one of

the “conditions” for a lawful expropriation and the second and third paragraphs of Article
7 specify how that compensation is to be “computed” and “paid” but neither of these
provisions intends to specify remedies for Respondent’s breaches of Articles 3 and 7.!4!
Claimant specifically rejects the argument that as Article 7 also refers to indirect
expropriations which, according to Respondent, would always be unlawful, it must also
apply to unlawful expropriations. It maintains that Article 7 only determines liability; it
does not determine what damages are due for the breach. '*7

195. Claimant further notes that any “standard” in Article 7 would concern only expropriations
but could not be applied to determine the remedies for Respondent’s breaches of Articles
3(2) and 3(3) of the Treaty.'*? Claimant refers to the tribunal in Crystallex v. Venezuela,
which held:

“(T]he Article VII(1) ‘standard’ is only concerned with expropriation, and not
breaches of other BIT standards. Because the Tribunal has found breaches of
FET (in addition to an expropriation), the Tribunal considers that the ‘full
reparation’ principle under customary international law must be applied as a
consequence of its decision on liability. In other words, given the cumulative
nature of the breaches that the Tribunal must compensate, and especially in
view of its findings on FET that the Respondent’s conduct caused all the
investments made by Crystallex to become worthless, the Tribunal will apply
the full reparation standard according to customary international law.”'“4

196. Claimant rejects the argument that there is a consistent practice that tribunals would
calculate damages for Treaty breaches under the standard of compensation set out in the
expropriation provision and claims that “the overwhelming weight of authority” rather
confirms that the customary international law standard of full reparation applies and none
of the cases cited by Respondent actually supports its argument. In Claimant’s view, this
is also confirmed by Respondent’s legal expert Dr. Ripinsky, who states in his treatise
that “[a]n award of compensation for unlawful expropriation is governed by customary

international law.”'45

197. In any event, Claimant notes that even if Article 7 were to be applied to determine the
remedies for Respondent’s breaches, the first sentence of Article 7(2) provides for
compensation equal to the “market value of the investment immediately prior to the
expropriation.” According to Claimant, this sentence is consistent with the full reparation
standard and, where neither the valuation date nor the use of the fair market value standard

is in dispute, can be seen as satisfying the Chorzéw Factory standard.'“° Claimant adds:
“Here too, payment of fair market value immediately before the expropriation would
satisfy the Chorzéw Factory standard, so long as all consequences of Pakistan’s other

unlawful conduct before the expropriation date are also excluded from the valuation.”'*7

Claimant notes that Respondent, however, relies on the second sentence of Article 7(2),
which applies “[w]here that value cannot be readily ascertained.” Claimant argues that
Respondent has failed to explain why that would be the case and the alternative
compensation calculation in Article 7(2) should apply. '4*

Finally, Claimant argues that even if Article 7(2) were to have any relevance, the standard
of compensation for a lawful expropriation could only serve as a floor for any damages
award for Respondent’s willful breaches of the Treaty and it would not support

Respondent’s proposed alternative valuation methods.'4?

In response to Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal’s determination of compensation
“must be equitable,” proportionate and avoid disparity between the amount invested by
Claimant and the compensation awarded, Claimant argues that awarding full reparation
in the form of damages equal to the fair market value of Claimant’s investment as of 15
November 2011 is also “the just result’? of Respondent’s Treaty breaches which have

given Respondent “total control of the immensely valuable asset it took from TCCA.”'*°

Claimant contends that Respondent overstates the role of equitable considerations which,
according to Dr. Ripinsky, could “be applied only within the boundaries of judicial
discretion left by legal rules.”'*' In Claimant’ s view, such discretion is eliminated by the
clear customary international law legal principle of full reparation, which “militates
against under-compensation as well as against over-compensation.” Claimant

of the case and “exercise[] its judgment in a reasoned manner,” to “make the best estimate

that it can of the amount of the loss.”!*?

Respondent’s breaches which included a secret plan to oust TCCA while repeatedly
misrepresenting Respondent’s intentions until the feasibility work was complete.
Claimant adds that any uncertainty about the fair market value of its investment has been

caused by Respondent’s Treaty breaches. !*3

As for Respondent’s reliance on the principle of proportionality, Claimant argues that this
principle is already incorporated in the principle of full reparation because, as noted in
the commentary on the ILC Articles, “[c]ompensation is limited to damage actually
suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act, and excludes damage which is
indirect or remote.”'*4 In addition, Claimant claims that awarding anything less than fair
market value would unjustly enrich Respondent because it now has exclusive control over
the asset that it took from TCCA and the fair market value of TCCA’s investment

represents only 44% of the total value of the resource as of the valuation date.'*>

Finally, Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument regarding a “disparity” between the
amount invested and the fair market value of the investment as of the valuation date and
refers to the treatise of Dr. Ripinsky where he stated that “[t]ere are numerous examples
of businesses being sold for a price much higher than the amount originally invested,
particularly if the business proves successful” and that when an investor “develops its
business ‘from scratch’ ,” any “connection between the invested amount and the value of
the investment appears to be much weaker.”!*° Claimant further quotes:

“By the very nature of the entrepreneurial activity, the sum total of

investments is normally lower than the value of a business created as a result.

To create a business, in addition to money, an investor usually contributes

other ingredients such as management skills, know-how and technology,

which add value of the investment and are of particular importance in areas

such as energy, infrastructure or construction, frequently featuring in

investor-State arbitrations. It is not abnormal for a business’s FMV to exceed

the invested amount several times over.”!*7

Claimant also refers to Irmgard Marboe, who considers in her work on damages in
investment law that “[g]reat care must ... be taken not to link the amount of compensation
or damages closely to the investment actually undertaken, if the investment has good

future propsects” because the State could otherwise be motivated to expropriate or impair
it.158

Claimant further notes that there is a correlation between the risk of the investment and
the returns an investor would expect, arguing that “when a very risky investment succeeds,
there should be an especially significant ‘disparity’ between the amount invested and the
value of the investment.” Claimant submits that is precisely the business model of the
global mining industry and notes that there is common ground between the Parties that
only 1 in every 10,000 exploration projects results in a productive mine. According to
Claimant, the Governments knew when they decided to take over the project that Reko
Dig is that 1-in-10,000 discovery — knowledge that was established through the efforts of
Claimant and its owners to de-risk every aspect of the project; accordingly, the fair market

value must necessary constitute a very high multiple of the amount invested. !*?

b. Requirement of Causation

Claimant accepts that it must show that Respondent’s Treaty breaches caused its loss. It
notes, however, that the Tribunal has already found that Respondent’s conduct in taking
over Reko Dig “deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and thereby directly
caused a loss.” In Claimant’s view, the causal relationship has thereby been determined

and all that remains is for that loss to be quantified.'©°

In particular, Claimant contends that Respondent cannot rely on the absence of a Mineral
Agreement because the Tribunal has already found that the Governments abandoned the
negotiations in bad faith pursuant to Balochistan’s unlawful decision to take over the
project. Similarly, Claimant considers that Respondent cannot benefit from the absence
of third-party financing commitments or specific permits, which could not have been
pursued without the mining lease that Balochistan unlawfully denied.'*!

More generally, Claimant submits that the Tribunal must establish fair market value in a
hypothetical context where Respondent would have fully respected its obligations under
the Treaty and must correct for any negative effect that the conduct of the Governments
has had on the value of Claimant’s investment. Claimant claims that its damages may also

not be reduced by the risk of future Treaty violations against which the Treaty is meant

to protect.!°

210. Claimant concludes:

“Thus, the Tribunal must assume that Balochistan would have honored
(instead of repudiated) all of its obligations under the CHEJVA, including the
obligation to be ‘just and faithful’ to TCC and ‘not do or omit to be done
anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture . . . are prejudiced.’ The
Tribunal must also assume that both Governments would have acted
consistently with TCCA’s legitimate expectation— arising directly from the
Governments’ own representations—that the Governments would support
and facilitate TCCA’s investment.”!®

c. Standard and Burden of Proof
211. Claimant accepts that it has the burden of proof as to its loss.!

212. As to the standard of proof, Claimant submits that once it has been shown that a loss has
been incurred, damages should be awarded even if the specific amount cannot be assessed
with certainty. Claimant quotes from the Crystallex tribunal, which held that “once the
fact of future profitability is established and is not essentially of speculative nature, the

amount of such profits need not be proven with the same degree of certainty.”'®

213.

w

Claimant contends that while the fact of the loss is subject to the normal balance-of-
probabilities standard, the quantum of the loss can be proven by providing a “reasonable
basis” for the tribunal’s assessment.'® On the basis of the record before it, the Tribunal
must then “make the best estimate that it can of the amount of the loss.”'®” Quoting from
the tribunal in Gemplus v. Mexico, Claimant argues that it “would be wrong in principle”

to deprive it of the value of its investment on “Jack of evidentiary grounds when that lack

of evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent’s own wrongs.”!

214. According to Claimant, the “absolute certainty” standard advanced by Respondent is not
supported by any case and could never be satisfied.'°? Claimant submits that the

authorities on which Respondent relies in support of its alleged “heightened requirement”
for proof of damages support only “the undisputed proposition that a ‘possibility of
damages’ is not enough to establish the fact of the loss, and the tautological proposition

that what is sufficient is ‘a sufficiently certain damages case.””!”

215. Claimant maintains that not only is there no heightened standard of proof but, to the
contrary, tribunals have repeatedly held that “Jess certainty is required in proof of the
actual amount of damages.” In light of the Tribunal’s findings in its Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability, Claimant argues that there can be no doubt that it has suffered
a loss and therefore considers it sufficient to provide a reasonable basis to quantify that
loss.'7! In Claimant’s view, the fact of the loss is in any event incontestable as Respondent
itself called Claimant’s investment “a profitable project or national importance” and
estimated that the Reko Diq deposits were worth more than a hundred billion US

dollars. !7

d. Appropriate Valuation Method

216. Claimant submits that the amount of its loss should be quantified based on the DCF
valuation method, more specifically the “practical, industry-informed application of well-
established principles” used in the modern DCF model applied by its expert Prof. Davis
which it considers to be “the best method to value a development-stage mining project
like Reko Dig.”'”

217. Claimant contends that the DCF method is employed by tribunals “whenever the claimant
has established the fact of future profitability.” According to Claimant, the DCF approach
is appropriate in the present case for the following reasons: (i) it would have been used
by actual buyers and sellers if Reko Diq had been sold in November 2011; (ii) it is
endorsed by internationally-recognized standards in the mining industry such as the
standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) and the
VALMIN Committee established to provide standards for mineral property valuation in
Australia; (iii) TCCA has provided ample evidence for the DCF inputs in this arbitration,
including the Feasibility Study which proved “decades of profitability even under
unfavorable market conditions” and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study which proved
Reko Diq’s enormous reserves; and (iv) recent ICSID cases featuring similar facts
affirmed the suitability of income-based methodologies for valuing projects like Reko

Digq.!” In this regard, Claimant points out, inter alia, that the tribunal in Gold Reserve v.
Venezuela concluded that “a DCF method can be reliably used in the instant case because
of the commodity nature of the product and detailed mining cash flow analysis previously
performed” and that the Crystallex tribunal concluded that “predicting future income from
ascertained [gold] reserves to be extracted by the use of traditional mining techniques
could be done with a significant degree of certainty, even without a record of past

production.” '7°

218. Claimant maintains that the tribunals’ findings in Crystallex and Gold Reserve, as well as
in Rusoro v. Venezuela and even Khan v. Mongolia support the application of the DCF
method in this case.'’° Claimant argues that contrary to Respondent’s submission, the
respondent State in Gold Reserve did raise the argument that the investment was not yet
operational but did not succeed on this argument and that the tribunal specifically rejected
alternative valuation methods by the claimant’s experts, preferring “to use the DCF model
only.”'77 Claimant further contends that the Crystallex tribunal endorsed forward-looking
methodologies and while the claimaint did not advance a DCF valuation, applied another
income-based approach which as Dr. Ripinsky agreed “resembles” DCF.'”* As for the
Khan tribunal’s rejection of the DCF method, Claimant argues that it was based on the
uncertainties associated with projects run by junior companies and explicitly held to be
incomparable to “large, producing multi-project comanpies.”'” Finally, Claimant notes
that in Copper Mesa, the claimant itself cited the CIMVal standards “to note that income-
based approaches are not suitable for properties at an exploration stage” and was facing
violent local opposition.'*° According to Claimant, the latter also applied to the project in

Bear Creek where the tribunal concluded that the project could not “be considered to be

viable” in the short term due to “widespread social unrest.”'*!

Claimant argues that the appropriate valuation method is a question of fact to be assessed
on a case-by-case basis and not as a matter of law. It rejects what it refers to as
Respondent’s “‘bright-line rule” that non-operational ventures cannot be valued using a
DCF method.'*? Claimant quotes from the Crystallex tribunal which held that “there is
no one methodology best suited for determining the fair market value of the investment
lost in every situation” and that “whether a particular method is appropriate to utilize is

based on the circumstances of each individual case.”'®

In Claimant’s view, Respondent’s “bright-line rule” is not supported by any of the
authorities it cites and not even by its own legal expert Dr. Ripinsky who merely states
that a record of profitability is “treated ... as the best evidence to support the application
of the DCF method” and quotes the Vivendi tribunal for the proposition that “the absence
of a history of demonstrated profitability does not absolutely preclude the use of DCF
valuation methodology.”'** Claimant also refers to Dr. Ripinsky’s treatise in which he
states:

“Consider a situation where an investor obtains a concession for the

exploration and exploitation of oil: the investor will carry a risk of not

discovering oil and thus losing the totality of its investment. At the same time,

once the exploration campaign proves successful, the major risk of the

investment is gone, and one should be able to predict with reasonable

certainty the range of revenues that the concession will generate, even

without a prior record of profitable operations. Perhaps with such situations

in mind, it has been suggested that lost profits should be awarded where they

can be proven with reasonable certainty and calculated on a ‘rational basis,’

even if the claimant is a new business ... This argument makes sense;

however, it remains for a tribunal in each particular case to decide whether

the evidence on the record is sufficient.”'®

Claimant claims that DCF valuation is particularly suited to value development-stage
mining projects. Claimant considers that this is confirmed by Respondent’s valuation
experts who in its view support a forward-looking analysis of the project’s future
profitability and by Dr. Ripinsky who notes in his expert report that “in some respects,

the mining sector may be more amenable to application of the DCF methods.”!**
Claimant also refers to its own expert Prof. Davis who explains that “compared with
valuing assets in other sectors,” in the mining industry, “many aspects of the projected
cash flows are readily known’ or ascertainable.!*”

Claimant further argues that neither a comparables valuation approach nor a cost-based
method could capture the value of its investment. It refers to Dr. Ripinsky who states that

awarding sunk costs is “generally considered to be a conceptually weak method of
estimating the fair market value of start-up projects (as opposed to acquisitions of
existing, operational enterprises)’ and puts the investor in the position as if the
investment had never occurred — rather than the position as if the breaches had not
occurred as required by the principle of full reparation. Quoting from Dr. Ripinsky,
Claimant argues that the costs approach “generally does not meet the legal requirement
to make the award equivalent to the investment’s fair market value.”'*® In Claimant's
view, the same applies to the valuation method applied by Dr. Burrows because it is also
a backword-looking method and has in any event not been correctly applied. !*°

Finally, Claimant rejects the argument that Prof. Davis’ “modern DCF” model has never
been applied in investment arbitration, emphasizing that it is “simply a form of the widely
adopted DCF method” and properly reflects economic reality in this case.!°° According
to Claimant, it is in fact the only method capable of accurately valuing a project like Reko
Dig.!!

Claimant submits that “[t]he modern DCF method more accurately discounts future cash
flows for both systematic and asymmetric risks, incorporates market information, and
incorporates management's flexibility to choose different options in reponse to evolving
circumstances” which makes it “particularly well-suited for the valuation of a long-life
mine like Reko Dig.”'°* Claimant adds that the modern DCF approach has been observed
to be “particularly useful for valuing mines and other natural resources assets because
of the volatility of natural resources prices and the existence of well-developed forward

markets that provide reliable market information about risk-adjusted price

expectations.” '

Claimant further submits that by contrast to treating risk as a constant, annually
compounding factor as is done in the traditional DCF model, modern DCF can take into
account that “the risk associated with late-stage cash flows is more or less constant over
time for copper and gold mines.” In addition, Claimant argues that modern DCF can
separately account for the two types of risk, i.e.: (i) systematic risks which are addressed
by using risk-adjusted price projections of future prices from markets in forward
contracts; and (ii) asymmetric risks for which modern DCF makes individual appropriate
adjustments to account for the average effect of each risk on cost and production
quantities. As risks are thereby priced at source, the cash flows can then be discounted at
the risk-free rate.!°4

Claimant submits that the modern DCF method further uses simulation of a large number
of scenarios in order to account for the uncertainty regarding, e.g., the fluctutation of
copper prices in the future, and permit the incorporation of active management such as
the choice whether to expand the mine depending on the development of prices. Claimant
refers to its witness Mr. Luksic who explained that the flexibility to adapt productivity to
price cycles “is immensely valuable.”'> Claimant further notes that while the traditional
DCF method gives relatively little value to expected cash flows after the first two decades
of mine life, Mr. Luksic explained that “this flexibility is what makes long-life mines so
attractive: they help you manage the volatility of commodity price.

 

. Copper prices go
through cycles of highs and lows and when you have a long life of mine you can ride those

cycles in a way that maximizes value.”!°°

According to Claimant, the modern DCF valuation method is rooted in “decades-old work
of Nobel Prize-winning economists” and is “widely taught in business schools and
routinely applied in the mining industry.” Therefore, even if this method were to be
considered “new” to international arbitration, this would be due to an unsurprising lag of
incorporating existing industry practice into arbitral adjudication. In Claimant’s view, the
same applied to the use of the DCF method in general, which was widely used in the
industry before it became established in arbitration.!?”

2. Summary of Respondent’s Position

a. Standard of Compensation

228. Respondent accepts that “the proper measure of quantum is the market value of TCC on
November 15, 2011.”'°8

229. According to Respondent, the only issue in dispute between the Parties in this regard is
whether “market value” refers to the standard of compensation in the Treaty or the
Chorz6w Factory standard. According to Respondent, “market value” is captured by the
compensation standard agreed by the parties to the Treaty.!°? Respondent adds that there
is a “growing trend” to apply the BIT compensation standard regarding expropriation to
all Treaty breaches and refers to the tribunal in Occidental v. Ecuador, which found that
the claimant’s investment had not been accorded fair and equitable treatment and was
expropriated and then determined “as mandated by Article III of the Treaty, the fair
market value of this investment.”?°° Respondent submits that the BIT standard for
expropriation was also applied by the tribunals in OJEG v. Venezuela, CME v. Czech
Republic and Flughafen v. Venezuela?!

230. Respondent argues that the compensation standard to be applied to the quantification of
damages for all breaches in this case is therefore the standard set out in Article 7 of the
Treaty, which applies to direct and indirect, and thus any form of, expropriation.
Respondent further argues that if the category of unlawful expropriations existed, all
indirect expropriation would fall within that category; as a result, Article 7 would also
apply to any expropriations, including unlawful expropriations, and exclude the
application of a lex generalis taken from customary international law.?°?

231. Respondent further disagrees with Claimant’s reference to Chorzéw Factory as reflecting
customary international law and adds that, in any event, Claimant agrees that Article 7 of

the Treaty is
standard.?%

‘consistent’ with what it considers to the customary international law

asset at the Valuation Date, both with reasonable knowledge of the facts and
circumstances surrounding the asset and neither being under any compulsion to
transact.”?* In Respondent’s view, this eliminates any use of “speculative, feeble or
financially or technically unsound bases” to determine the fair market value of Claimant’ s
investment.2°>

Respondent contends that the wording of Article 7(2) of the Treaty, which can be found
in 17 of 23 BITs signed by Australia, is “not typical of international investment treaties”

and should therefore be given special consideration by the Tribunal.?°°

Respondent notes that Article 7(2) of the Treaty requires the Tribunal to assess whether
the fair market value of Claimant’s investment is “readily ascertainable” and considers
that the valuation presented by Claimant “is as far as a method could be from rendering
a ‘readily ascertainable’ result.”?°’ According to Respondent, Claimant has conceded as
much when stating that “a claimant in TCCA’s position has wrongfully been deprived of

the opportunity to prove quantum with certainty.”

Respondent rejects the argument that the uncertainty is a result of Pakistan’s breaches of
the Treaty and claims that it rather “derives from the infancy of TCCA’s project in
Pakistan coupled with the multiple hurdles that it faced going forward.” Respondent
claims that, by contrast, in the Gemplus case relied on by Claimant, the lack of evidence
was directly attributable to the respondent as the claimants were owning a concession
agreement with an operational track record behind it. Respondent further argues that if
Claimant’s argument were followed, this would apply in all cases in which damages for
an unlawful expropriation or other supposed breaches of the treaty are calculated based
on the BIT compensation standard.

Consequently, Respondent argues that pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Treaty, the Tribunal
must determine a value “in accordance with generally recognized principles of valuation
and equitable principles taking into account the capital invested, depreciation, capital

already repatriated, replacement value, and other relevant factors.”?'®

Respondent refers to the separate opinion of Judge Bhandari in Maritime Delimitation in
the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) who considered that
“Ti]n a case such as this, in which the evidence presented to the Court is inadequate to

appropriate decision is to award the injured State a lump sum amount of compensation

based on equitable considerations.”*"'!

238. According to Respondent, the only amount factually supported with “suffi

 

would be the sunk costs of Claimant’s investment.?!”

b. Requirement of Causation

239. Respondent submits that Claimant bears the burden of proving that the damages it alleges
are a direct consequence of the Treaty breaches and that, in order to establish causation,
it must prove that: (i) the alleged injury was caused by the wrongful act as a matter of
fact; and (ii) the loss is not too remote and speculative. Respondent refers to the tribunal
in Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania according to which there must be a “sufficient link between
the wrongful act and the damage in question” and there is “a threshold beyond which

damage, albeit linked to the wrongful act, is considered too indirect or remote.”?'3

240. Respondent submits that under customary international law, Claimant must show that its
losses were caused by the Treaty breaches as a matter of fact. Respondent refers to Article
31 of the ILC Articles as well as the Gemplus tribunal, which held that there must be “a
sufficient causal link between the treaty breach by the state and the loss sustained by the

claimant.”

'4 Respondent considers that Claimant has failed to establish factual causation
and points in particular to the absence of a Mineral Agreement which left “key
commercial terms” uncertain. Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal did not find that

the non-conclusion of the Mineral Agreement constitutes a breach of the Treaty.?!>

241.

Respondent further submits that Claimant must show that its losses were caused by the
Treaty breaches as a matter of law. Respondent points to the Biwater Gauff tribunal,
which held that there was a “lack of linkage between each of the wrongful acts of the
Republic, and each of the actual, specific heads of loss and damage” and concluded that

the damage was “attributable to other factors.”?!® Quoting from the Commentary to the
ILC Articles, Respondent submits that the test of legal causality is whether damages are
directly linked to the breach and not “too indirect, remote and uncertained to be
appraised.”?""

242. According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to prove that Respondent directly caused
the damages it is seeking and that its alleged losses are not too remote or speculative.

Respondent considers that “the speculative nature of the damages forms one of the key
conclusions” reached by its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells.?!®

243. Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal’s finding on the existence of a Treaty breach
does not discharge Claimant’s burden of proof on causation and maintains that Claimant

has failed to prove that the amount of compensation is a direct consequence of the

rejection of the Mining Lease Application.?!?

c. Standard and Burden of Proof

244. Respondent submits that Claimant has the burden of proof on the existence and quantum
of the damages it is seeking.”? Respondent adds that a claimant must also provide
evidence of the damages it alleges and refers to the tribunal in AES v. Kazakhstan, which

did not award damages because “Claimants failed to duly establish their damage,” and
the tribunal in Rompetrol v. Romania, which declined to award damages under a certain
head due to a “failure by the claimant to produce any reliably concrete evidence of actual
losses under this head.”

245. Respondent further relies on its legal expert Dr. Ripinsky who states that a “claimant must

prove the losses it has incurred with reasonable, or sufficient, certainty. Respondent

further quotes from Dr. Ripinsky’s first expert report:

“Claimant bears the burden of proving the losses it has incurred and the
amount of damages that is commensurate with these losses. In international
investment law, claimant must prove damages with reasonable, or sufficient,
certainty. This standard applies to both past as well as future losses. For

obvious reasons, the task of meeting this standard is more challenging in
relation to future losses and valuation methods based on_ future
projections.”??>
246. Specifically with regard to Claimant’s reliance on a “modern DCF” method, Respondent
quotes from Dr. Ripinsky’s report:
“(T]he standard of proof requires the claimant to demonstrate with sufficient
certainty that the validity of these assumptions and the critical parameters

(‘fundamentals’) underlying the DCF analysis are — individually and taken
together — established with sufficient certainty.?*

 

247. Respondent considers that Claimant failed to provide reasonably and sufficiently certain
information and therefore failed to discharge its burden of proof. In Respondent’s view,
Reko Dig “faced key challenges that would have prevented it from becoming profitable,
which requires the Tribunal to dismiss the compensation claims.” It refers to Dr. Ripinsky
who states that “[i]n some investor-State disputes, tribunals have refused to grant
compensation, despite finding a treaty breach, where the claimant had failed to prove
that it had suffered a loss as a result of the respondent State’s unlawful conduct or to

provide a reasonable basis for the estimation of damages.”??>

248. In Respondent’s view, the rule that a claimant, who cannot prove having incurred specific
given amounts and the causal link between these amounts and the proven internationally
wrongful act, cannot recover these amounts was confirmed by the ICJ in Maritime
Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua).??°
In Respondent’s view, Claimant has explicitly admitted that it cannot prove quantum with
certainty and it cannot shift its evidentiary shortcomings on Pakistan.” Respondent again
refers to Dr. Ripinsky who explains:

“The point is sometimes made that where a State is to blame for a project’s
interruption, the claimant should be given the benefit of doubt in respect of
any uncertainty in determining what exactly would have happened in the
absence of a breach. This position does not seem to be methodologically
correct from the point of view of the burden and standard of proof, nor does
it respect the task of determining the FMV as of a certain date (i.e. on the
basis of facts available as of that date).”??*

249. Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument regarding the standard of proof and notes that
even the tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine on which Claimant relies endorsed “the

requirement that speculative losses be excluded from the calculation” and ultimately

rejected the claimant’s future quantum scenario as “too uncertain.”?”?

250. Respondent argues that the “Modern DCF” methodology applied by Prof. Davis requires
“a high level of certainty”; by opting for that “fragile model,” Claimant opted for the
requisite standard of proof.?*° Quoting from ADM v. Mexico, Respondent argues that “lost
profits are allowable insofar as the Claimants prove that the alleged damage is not
speculative or uncertain — i.e., that the profits anticipated were probable or reasonably
anticipated and not merely possible.”?>! The tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina stated that
“compensation is generally awarded only where future profitability can be established

(the fact of profitability as opposed to the amount) with some level of certainty.”?>

d. Appropriate Valuation Method
251.

Respondent contends that the valuation method applied by Claimant’s valuation expert,
which it describes as “a rather unique variation of a discounted cash flow (‘DCF’)
valuation, which has not been adopted by the mining industry or investment tribunals,”
cannot help in determining the fair market value of Claimant’s investment as of the

valuation date.?*

252. In Respondent’s view, the “modern DCF’ method does not meet the standard for a
“readily ascertainable” market value.?*+ Respondent claims that Prof. Davis only
selectively uses market information such as commodity forward rates and interest rates
but otherwise uses his own assumptions about long-term price projections, capital and
operating costs as well as asymmetric risks. Respondent therefore rejects the argument
that this is a “true market-based approach.”?*>

253. According to Respondent, the “Modern DCF” method has been fabricated by Claimant
and its expert to “provide a designer, bespoke methodology allowing TCC to offer the
appearance of pseudo-scientific support for its predetermined outlandish valuation.”
Respondents considers that Prof. Davis expressly admitted during the Hearing on

Quantum that his method was a way to reach a predetermined value that would not be
validated by actual valuation methods.?*°

254. Respondent emphasizes that there is no arbitration case in which the “Modern DCF”
approach would have been applied and points out that in the only case in which it was
raised, Bear Creek, it was dismissed by the tribunal as inappropriate in the circumstances
of valuing the mining assets.”*’ Respondent further notes that Prof. Davis was able to
point to only one transaction in the mining industry in which it was applied — which was
described in the press as “the worst mining deal ever.” Respondent adds that neither
Claimant nor its shareholders used “Modern DCF” in their transactions on mining
assets.?** Respondent contends that CIMVal also describes the method as “[n]ot widely
used and not widely understood,” which confirms, in Respondent’s view that the method

cannot reflect “generally recognized principles of valuation’ as required by Article 7(2)
of the Treaty.?*?

255. Respondent refers to its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells who consider:

“In sum, the ‘modern’ part of the approach used in the Brattle Report boils
down mainly to the application of a risk-free discount rate to a project that is
extremely risky. The Report does not adjust projected cash flows to account
for these risks. This is amply demonstrated when the result is compared to the
results obtained in the SNC-Lavalin studies, which are praised by TCC and
use methods typical of those applied by real buyers and sellers to value such
an asset. ... Similarly, the result in the Brattle Report is grossly out of line
with the arm’s length purchase price of the identical asset five years
earlier.”

256. More generally, Respondent claims that, quoting from the expert report of Dr. Ripinsky,
“the weight of authority clearly indicates that, as a general rule, the DCF method is not
appropriate for investment projects that have not demonstrated their capacity to generate
profits by a track record of performance.”**'! Respondent submits that, inter alia, the

World Bank Guidelines on Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment and the Commentary

to the ILC Articles support DCF valuations only for going concerns.~*~ Respondent also

method was denied due to a lack of a sufficient operational track record and/or proven

xs

Respondent argues that an exception to this general rule requires “several important
fundamentals to be in place as at the date of valuation, such as inter alia the existence of
confirmed financing necessary for the project as well as clarity about the commercial
terms of operation and a detailed (independently verified) business plan.” Respondent
adds that further “fundamental uncertainties” that generally preclude reliance on DCF

“may include technological, logistical, infrastructure, regulatory and other risks.”**

25)

*

In this regard, Respondent notes that only | in every 10,000 exploration projects results
in a productive mine and argues that even on the basis of a well-prepared feasibility study,
the risk of failure is still substantial, i.e., within 10-15%. It refers to the tribunal in Mesa
v. Ecuador, which rejected the methodologies before it to value a copper mining project
that had not yet begun production except for a cost-based approach because it considered
them “too uncertain, subjective and dependent upon contingencies, which cannot be
fairly assessed by the Tribunal.”*4° Respondent also relies on the tribunal in Khan v.
Mongolia, which rejected the DCF method as “too speculative” because it considered it
“far from certain” whether the mine would have reached production, on what terms the
parties would have participated in the venture and whether theclaimants would have been
involved.?4”

259. According to Respondent, this excludes any form of DCF, let alone the “Modern DCF”
method crafted by Prof. Davis, as confirmed by the submissions of Peru in Bear Creek
where the State pointed out that the project “has no history of profitable operation and is
subject to serious uncertainties, including difficult-to quantify social license risk. For this
reason, investment treaty tribunals routinely reject the use of DCF valuation for non-

producting assets.”?*8

Respondent further refers to the tribunal in Metalclad v. Mexico, which held:

“W[hlere the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to
establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future
profits cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value. The
Tribunal agrees with Mexico that a discounted cash flow analysis is
inappropriate in the present case because the landfill was never operative
and any award based on future profits would be wholly speculative.”

In Respondent’s view, the same is confirmed by the Crystallex tribunal on which
Claimant relies because it found that only “once the fact of future profitability is
established and is not essentially of a speculative nature, the amount of such profits need

not be proven with the same degree of certainty.”?°

Respondent further argues that while uncertainties may be accepted in valuations for
commercial purposes, this does not apply to legal proceedings where valuation serves to
measure damages and tribunals should therefore “be strict about evidentiary certainty of

claims for damages.”>!

In response to Claimant’s argument that there is no “bright-line” rule excluding the
application of DCF “as a matter of law,” Respondent agrees that the applicability of DCF
is decided on the facts of each case but maintains that it is inappropriate to apply DCF
where the facts show no proof of profitability or sufficient certainty of the viability of the
project in the future. Respondent considers it decisive that Claimant relies on only three
cases in support of its argument that DCF should be applied and argues that none of these

: > 2
cases supports Claimant’s case.”

Respondent notes that only the Gold Reserve tribunal applied a DCF method, based on
an agreement between the parties, and in all cases the damages awarded by the tribunals
were “roughly equal to the amounts claimed as investments made in the project.’?>?
Respondent further argues that the facts in Gold Reserve and Crystallex were substantially
different from the facts in the present case, in particular as regards the stage of the project,
investments made and, in Gold Reserve, an agreement on the valuation method, whereas
the Crystallex tribunal rejected DCF as “inappropriate for a gold project.””** The Rusoro
tribunal also considered a DCF methodology “inappropriate” given the “lack of a proven

record of financial performance” and set out criteria for its application which, according

to Respondent, are not present in Claimant’s project.?>>

Respondent also refers to the Khan tribunal which rejected DCF as too speculative for the
project and rejects the argument that this was due to the “junior” character of the
company.?”° Finally, Respondent relies on Bear Creek in which the tribunal, despite the
fact that “Bear Creek was better positioned and more advanced than TCCA,” took into
account that the claimant had not received many of the required governmental approvals
and concluded that the project remained too speculative and uncertain to rely on the DCF
method. Most importantly, Respondent emphasizes that the Bear Creek tribunal did not
apply “Modern DCF.”?*” Quoting from Dr. Ripinsky, Respondent argues that the tribunal
thereby followed “the consistent line of earlier decisions that deemed the DCF method to
be generally inappropriate for valuing investment projects without a performance track
record.”?8

Respondent emphasizes its position that Dr. Ripinsky’s statements in his expert reports
submitted in this arbitration are consistent with his public writings. It draws the Tribunal’ s
attention to the fact that in the quotes relied on by Claimant, Dr. Ripinsky stated that DCF
may be considered “if the business proves successful” and referred to “established
businesses.”?*? As for the cost approach, Dr. Ripinsky clarified that “if the evidence on
the record does not allow for the use of an income-based or market-based method, the

historic cost approach may be the only remaining option.”?®

Respondent submits that where the market value is not “readily ascertainable,” the
Tribunal should look to a backward-looking approach.”°! Respondent contends that its
expert Dr. Burrows derived the best approximation to the fair market value of Claimant’s
investment by using the prior transaction by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired the
shares in Claimant in 2006. Respondent emphasizes that “[t]o clarify, the valuation
submitted by Pakistan through the independent expert Dr. Burrows intends to challenge,
and not to cure, the procedural and scientific defects of TCC’s case on quantum, which

under applicable law should be dismissed by the Tribunal.”?°

Dr. Burrows’ reference to the set of prior transactions involving the acquisition of
Claimant, including a number of adjustments to account for changes that occurred until
the valuation date, i.e., changes in metal prices and country risk as well as “subsequent
efficient, proven investments.”?® According to Respondent, neither of the remaining
approaches proposed by Claimant nor “an uninformed, exaggerated guess on the size of
the mineral deposits actually available for mining,” whether made by Prof. Davis or Dr.
Mubarakmand, would have been taken into account by a willing buyer in determining the
fair market value.” In light of the remaining uncertainties associated with the project,
Respondent concludes that no prospective transaction would have been concluded based

on a forecast of future profits of the mine as of the valuation date.?°

Respondent further argues that if the Tribunal were to find that Dr. Burrows’ valuation
does not reflect the fair market value of Claimant’s investment, “the only other valuation
that could validly be performed under the Treaty is one based on actual, efficient, proven
investments made, adjusted for principles of equity.” Respondent adds that not all
investments made would be compensable and claims that the Treaty would “call for

further reductions due to the inefficiencies in TCC’s exploration work.”

In this context, Respondent notes that Article 7(2) of the Treaty also refers to “equitable

principles” and relies on the Commentary to the ILC Articles to argue that the
quantification of damages should reach “an equitable and acceptable outcome.”
Respondent also refers to the principle of proportionality and points to the disparity
between the amount claimed and the amount that Claimant allegedly invested, which

Respondent considers to be “completely disproportionate and inequitable.”?°"

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal will address the four issues discussed by the Parties, i.e: (i) the applicable
standard of compensation; (ii) the requirement of causation; (iii) the applicable standard
and burden of proof; and (iv) the valuation method to be applied to determine Claimant’s
damages, in turn.

a. Standard of Compensation

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that there is common ground between the Parties
regarding the date as of which the losses that Claimant claims to have incurred have to be

quantified. Respondent explicitly “accepts, that the proper measure of quantum is the
market value of TCC on November 15, 2011.”?° The Parties’ agreement regarding the
date of valuation is based on the Tribunal’s finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction and
Liability that Respondent has breached its obligations under Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3)
of the Treaty by denying TCCP’s Mining Lease Application in order to allow the GOB
to implement its own project instead.” The denial was notified to TCCP by the Licensing
Authority’s letter dated 15 November 2011.2” The Tribunal therefore agrees with the
Parties that Claimant’s alleged losses have to be quantified as of that date.

The Parties further agree that in order to quantify Claimant’s losses, the Tribunal must
determine the “market value” of TCC or, more precisely, the market value of Claimant’s
investment in the Reko Diq project as of 15 November 2011. The Tribunal has found in
its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that following the denial of TCCP’s Mining
Lease Application, the value of the CHEJVA and TCCP, and thus of Claimant’s
investment, was effectively neutralized.?’'! The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Parties
that Claimant’s losses are equivalent to the (entire) value that its investment would have
had if TCCP’s Mining Lease Application has not been denied in violation of
Respondent’s obligations under the Treaty.

The Tribunal further agrees with the Parties that the value to be determined is the “market
value” which, as defined by Claimant’s valuation expert Prof. Davis and quoted with

approval by Respondent,?”*

represents “the cash-equivalent amount a willing buyer would
pay a willing seller to purchase the asset at the Valuation Date, both with reasonable
knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the asset and neither being under

any compulsion to transact.”?”

There is also common ground that the value has to be determined “but for” the Treaty
breaches that the Tribunal has determined in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.
While the Parties are in disagreement as to the extent to which but-for assumptions have
to be made, in particular regarding the conclusion and terms of a Mineral Agreement, the
general principle of performing a but-for valuation is undisputed and can be derived from
both standards of compensation on which the Parties rely. In fact, this aspect relates to
the requirement of causation between Respondent’s breaches and the losses incurred by
Claimant and will be addressed in more detail below.

276. As for the standard of compensation, the Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal

277.

278.

should calculate compensation based on Article 7(2) of the Treaty, as alleged by
Respondent, or based on the standard of full reparation under customary international
law, as alleged by Claimant. Article 7(1) and (2) of the Treaty provides as follows:
“7. Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures having
effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to

as ‘expropriation’ ) the investments of investors of the other Party unless the

following conditions are complied with:

(a) the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal needs of

that Party and under due process of law;

(b) the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and

(c) the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and

effective compensation.

2. The compensation referred to in paragraph I(c) of this Article shall be

computed on the basis of the market value of the investment immediately

before the expropriation or impending expropriation became public

knowledge. Where that value cannot be readily ascertained, the

compensation shall be determined in accordance with generally recognised

principles of valuation and equitable principles taking into account the

capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement

value, and other relevant factors.”?"*
The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the wording of Article 7(2) (“The compensation
referred to in paragraph I(c)...”) indicates that the provision is, at least primarily,
intended to clarify how the compensation must be calculated in order for an expropriation
to comply with the legality requirements set out in Article 7(1). The Tribunal is aware
that both Parties have relied on case law supporting their respective arguments regarding
the question whether or not the provision should further apply to calculate the
compensation for an expropriation carried out in violation of the legality requirements in
Article 7(1) and/or compensation for Treaty breaches other than an expropriation.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is not necessary to express an opinion on this point in the
abstract. While Claimant takes the position that the Tribunal should apply the
compensation standard set out in Chorzéw Factory which it considers to be the relevant
standard under customary international law, it also argues that this approach is consistent
with Article 7 of the Treaty, in particular the first sentence in Article 7(2) pursuant to
which compensation “shall be computed on the basis of the market value of the investment

274 Exhibit C-4, Article 7(1) and (2).

immediately before the expropriation or impending expropriation became public

knowledge.”?”°

The dispute between the Parties concerns the second sentence in Article 7(2), which sets
out criteria for determining compensation “[w]here [market] value cannot be readily
ascertained.” Respondent argues that the valuation method presented by Claimant to
determine the market value of its investment does not produce a “readily ascertainable”
result and therefore leads to the application of the criteria in the second sentence.
Claimant, on the other hand, maintains that the market value of its investment can be
ascertained based on the valuation performed by its valuation expert Prof. Davis.

Consequently, if the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the market value of Claimant’s
investment can be “readily ascertained” based on the evidence and valuation methods
before it, there is no need to decide whether this result is based on the compensation
provision in Article 7(2) of the Treaty or a compensation standard under customary
international law.

As will be out in more detail below, the Tribunal is convinced that in the specific
circumstances of this individual case, the valuation method relied on by Claimant and its
valuation expert Prof. Davis is the most appropriate measure to value Claimant’s
investment in Reko Dig. While it will therefore not be strictly necessary to resort to the
additional criteria set out in the second sentence of Article 7(2), the Tribunal will in any
event give due consideration to generally recognized principles of valuation and verify
whether the result it has reached based on Prof. Davis’ method is reconcilable with the
amount of capital invested by Claimant in order to ensure that Claimant will be awarded
compensation in the amount that truly reflects the damages it has incurred as a result of
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty.

b. Requirement of Causation

There is common ground between the Parties and Claimant explicitly accepts that “it must
show that Pakistan’s breaches of the Treaty caused TCCA’s loss.”?”° According to
Claimant, however, the causal relationship between Respondent’s breaches and its
damage has already been determined because the Tribunal has found in its Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability that “Respondent's conduct deprived Claimant of the value of
its investment and thereby directly caused a loss that is to be quantified at a later stage

of the proceedings.”?”

283. The Tribunal recalls that its finding was made as part of its conclusion on Claimant’s

284.

285.

claims, which may be quoted again at this point:

“In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, by denying TCCP’s Mining Lease
Application in order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead,
Respondent breached its obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable
treatment under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, carried out a measure having effect
equivalent to expropriation that did not comply with the requirements for a
lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, and impaired the use of
Claimant’s investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

While the Tribunal is aware that Respondent has further raised the argument

that Claimant’s claim must fail in limine because it has failed to address

causation, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to state at this point that

Respondent’s conduct deprived Claimant of the value of its investment and

thereby directly caused a loss that is to be quantified at a later stage of the

proceedings. In the Tribunal’s view, any specific questions on whether

Respondent’s conduct was causal for individual parts of Claimant’s — yet

unquantified — claim cannot be dealt with in the abstract but will be addressed

as part of the quantum phase of the proceedings.”?”*
The Tribunal affirms its previous finding that Respondent’s conduct has deprived
Claimant of the value of its investment and has thereby caused a loss that is equal to the
value that Claimant’s investment would have had if Respondent had not denied TCCP’s
Mining Lease Application in violation of its obligations under the Treaty. The Tribunal
has not, however, made a finding as to specific aspects of causation. In particular, the
Tribunal has not yet made a definitive finding as to whether the Reko Diq project would
have succeeded in the manner presented by Claimant and/or whether the assumptions
made by Claimant and its valuation expert Prof. Davis reflect the true value of the Reko
Diq project. As for the assumptions made in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study, this was explicitly emphasized by the Tribunal in its Decision on

Respondent’s Reconsideration Request.?””

Specifically with regard to the negotiations of the Mineral Agreement, Respondent is
correct in pointing out that the Tribunal has not made a finding that the non-conclusion
of a Mineral Agreement by the Governments amounts to a breach of Respondent’s
obligations under the Treaty. Consequently, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that a
but-for valuation cannot assume that a Mineral Agreement would have existed as of the
date of valuation. On the other hand, the Tribunal recalls its findings that in the absence
of Respondent’s breaches, once Claimant would have received a mining lease, there
would have been a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues in the

Mineral Agreement negotiations.”*° The question whether a Mineral Agreement would
have been concluded after the valuation date and, if so, on what terms, will be addressed
in more detail below.

At this point, i.e., in the context of causation, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to recall
the Parties’ agreement that Claimant must show that Respondent’s breaches caused its
losses. In other words, Claimant is entitled to compensation in the amount of the value
that its investment would have had but for Respondent’s breaches. If and to the extent the
Tribunal is not convinced that a specific risk or downside affecting Claimant’s investment
would not have existed in the but-for scenario, it will make the appropriate deduction in
order to determine those, and only those, losses that were caused by Respondent’s
breaches of the Treaty.

c. Standard and Burden of Proof

There is no dispute between the Parties and Claimant specifically accepts that “TCCA has

the burden of proof as to its loss.”?3!

The Parties are in dispute, however, as to the standard of proof that applies to the
quantification of Claimant’s loss. Claimant distinguishes between the fact of the loss,
which it considers to be subject to “the normal standard of balance of the probabilities,”
and the quantum of the loss in respect of which it considers it sufficient to provide a
“reasonable basis” for the Tribunal’s assessment. Respondent, on the other hand, takes
the position that Claimant must prove its losses, including the quantum, “with reasonable,
or sufficient, certainty.”

While Respondent repeatedly uses the term “absolute certainty” in its Post-Hearing Brief,
it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether it thereby suggests that this is the standard
that Claimant has to meet or rather a standard that Claimant purports to meet.2*? In its
Rejoinder, Respondent contends that the “modern” DCF method used by Prof. Davis
“requires absolute certainty”?

or “a high level of certainty” because it is “such a fragile
model.”>** In its Post-Hearing Brief, however, it reiterates its references to Dr. Ripinsk
gs pinsky

who supports a standard of “reasonable, or sufficient, certainty.”?*>

In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that a standard of “absolute certainty’ could
or should be applied to the quantification of Claimant’s damages. Respondent does not
cite any authority in this respect and its own legal expert does not support such a strict

standard of proof. As pointed out by Claimant, a standard of “absolute certainty” would
mean that damages would — almost certainly — never be awarded. There can hardly be
absolute proof for a hypothetical situation.

In the Tribunal’s view, the application of the modern DCF method, if considered
appropriate by the Tribunal, would not warrant a different standard of proof. As the
Tribunal will discuss in more detail below, the term “certainty-equivalent cash flows”
does not mean that cash flows have to be proven with “absolute certainty” but rather that
existing uncertainties have been quantified and incorporated into these cash flows.
Whether or not this has been done in a sufficient manner will form part of the assessment
whether Claimant has in fact met its burden of proof. It does not justify raising the

threshold of what has to be proven.

Respondent’s legal expert Dr. Ripinsky states with regard to the standard of proof in his
expert report:

“Claimant bears the burden of proving the losses it has incurred and the
amount of damages that is commensurate with these losses. In international
investment law, claimant must prove damages with reasonable, or sufficient,
certainty. This standard applies to both past as well as future losses. For
obvious reasons, the task of meeting this standard is more challenging in
relation to future losses and valuation methods based on future projections.

In a number of cases, arbitral tribunals have held that future losses must be
proved with ‘sufficient (degree of) certainty’, ‘sufficient degree of
probability’, ‘some level of certainty’, ‘comparative likelihood’ and that they
must be ‘probable and not merely possible’. The Commentaries to the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility refer to ‘sufficient certainty’ as a requirement
for the anticipated income stream to become a legally protected interest. In
the context of the United Nations Compensation Commission, ‘reasonable
certainty’ served as the standard of proof.”?*°

Claimant does not specifically dispute Dr. Ripinsky’s opinion but relies on the tribunal’s
findings in Crystallex v. Venezuela in support of its argument that once the fact of the loss
has been proven, the standard of proof for the quantum of damage does not require the
same degree of certainty. The Tribunal notes that in its assessment which standard of
proof it should apply to lost profits, the Crystallex tribunal considered several of the
authorities quoted by Dr. Ripinsky and drew the following conclusions:

“The ILC Articles recognize that in certain cases compensation for loss of

profits may be appropriate. Indeed, Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles provides

that ‘[t]he compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage

including loss of profits insofar as it is established’. The commentary to the

ILC Articles further notes that ‘[t]tribunals have been reluctant to provide

compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements’ and ‘[i]n cases

286 Ripinsky I, {fff 22-23.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 100 of 1447
Award
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -89-

where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where an anticipated
income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered a legally
protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable. This has normally
been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements or, in some cases, a well-
established history of dealings’.

Furthermore, according to an oft-cited authority, ‘in order to be allowable,
prospective profits must not be too speculative, contingent, uncertain, and the
like. There must be proof that they were reasonably anticipated; and that the
profits anticipated were probable and not merely possible’. The same idea
was expressed by the tribunal in ADM v. Mexico which held that ’ lost profits
are allowable insofar as the Claimants prove that the alleged damage is not
speculative or uncertain — i.e., that the profits anticipated were probable or
reasonably anticipated and not merely possible’.

 

Furthermore, the Vivendi v. Argentina tribunal noted that ‘compensation for
lost profits is generally awarded only where future profitability can be
established (the fact of profitability as opposed to the amount) with some level
of certainty’.

In the Tribunal’s view, all these authorities show that, once the fact of future
profitability is established and is not essentially of speculative nature, the
amount of such profits need not be proven with the same degree of certainty.
In other words, the Claimant must prove that it has been deprived of profits
that would have actually been earned. This requires proving that there is
sufficient certainty that it had engaged or would have engaged in a
profitmaking activity but for the Respondent’s wrongful act, and that such
activity would have indeed been profitable.

With those principles in mind, the question thus is whether in this case (i) it
is sufficiently certain that the Claimant would have made profits; and (ii) if
yes, whether the Claimant has provided the Tribunal with a reasonable basis
to assess such loss of profits. The two questions will be addressed in turn.”?57

294. Claimant also relies on the tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine, which held:

“The Tribunal agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding
forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or
uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty; the level of certainty is
unlikely, however, to be the same with respect to the conclusion that damages
have been caused, and the precise quantification of such damages. Once
causation has been established, and it has been proven that the in bonis party
has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual
amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to
provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence,
estimate the extent of the loss.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -90-

While the existence of damage is certain, calculating the precise amount of
the compensation is fraught with much more difficulty, inherent in the very
nature of the ‘but for’ hypothesis. Valuation is not an exact science. The
Tribunal has no crystal ball and cannot claim to know what would have
happened under a hypothesis of no breach; the best any tribunal can do is to
make an informed and conscientious evaluation, taking into account all the
relevant circumstances of the case, not unlike that made by anyone who
assesses the value of a business on the basis of its likely future earnings.”?*8

295. The Crystallex tribunal also quoted the first of these paragraphs and added:

“The tribunal is of the view that the emphasis should be put on the phrase
‘with reasonable confidence’ which seems to strike a wholesome and
pragmatic approach, prone to satisfy common law and civil law minds.

Other tribunals have come to similar conclusions. In SPP v. Egypt, for
example, the tribunal noted that ‘it is well-settled that the fact that damages
cannot be assessed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a
loss had been incurred’. And in Tecmed, the tribunal observed that ‘any
difficulty in determining the compensation does not prevent the assessment
of such compensation where the existence of damage is certain’.

 

Thus, an impossibility or even a considerable difficulty that would make it
unconscionable to prove the amount (rather than the existence) of damages
with absolute precision does not bar their recovery altogether. Arbitral
tribunals have been prepared to award compensation on the basis of a
reasonable approximation of the loss, where they felt confident about the fact
of the loss itself. In the Tribunal’s view, this approach may be particularly
warranted if the uncertainty in determining what exactly would have
happened is the result of the other party’s wrongdoing.”?*?

296. On that basis, it appears to the Tribunal that the standards invoked by the Parties are in
fact not too far apart. In fact, Dr. Ripinsky acknowledges this jurisprudence and draws
the following conclusion from it:

“A number of investment tribunals have suggested that once the fact of the
damage has been established, a claimant should not be required to prove the
actual amount of damages with the same degree of certainty. In the DCF
context, I take this to mean that uncertainties remain inherent in any DCF
analysis, and the method can still be used despite the impossibility of
producing a ‘scientifically precise’ result. After all, value established for a
hypothetical transaction is not a fact, but rather an informed opinion of how
much an asset is worth. However, for the DCF method to be accepted, the
claimant must get over the ‘hump’ of demonstrating its appropriateness and
reliability in the specific circumstances of the case.”

297. There appears to be no dispute regarding the accuracy of Dr. Ripinsky’s conclusion and

298.

the Tribunal agrees with it. Whether Claimant has demonstrated the appropriateness of
the DCF method, and specifically of the modern DCF method, in the present case will be
addressed in more detail below. At this point, it suffices to find that the standard of proof
cannot be such as to exclude a valuation because the Tribunal is not “certain” that the
result it produces is correct in terms of “scientifically precise.” On the other hand, the
Tribunal must be convinced that the valuation is appropriate in that it will produce a
sufficiently reliable result.

Respondent points out that Dr. Ripinsky also noted in his expert report that “[i]n some
investor-State disputes, tribunals have refused to grant compensation, despite finding a
treaty breach, where the claimant had failed to prove that it had suffered a loss as a result
of the respondent State’s unlawful conduct or to provide a reasonable basis for the
estimation of damages.”?*' In the Tribunal’s view, there is no dispute between the Parties
that Claimant has to prove that it suffered a loss and that it has to provide a reasonable
basis for the estimation of damages. The dispute therefore appears to concern not so much
the standard of proof but rather whether the valuation method used by Claimant and its
expert yields results that are not “too speculative” or “too uncertain” but rather enable the
Tribunal to assess Claimant’s damages “with reasonable confidence” and reach a
“reliable” conclusion.

. There is a dispute, however, as to whether the Tribunal may or even should take into

account the extent to which any uncertainties in the valuation result from Respondent’s
breaches — because these breaches have prevented the project from going forward and
eliminating uncertainties such as the terms of the Mineral Agreement and the terms of
third-party financing. The Crystallex tribunal indicated that this might be a consideration
to be taken into account. The tribunal in Gemplus v. Mexico even went further and
explicitly held:

“(T]he fact that this exercise is difficult is due directly to the Respondent's

breaches of the two BITs which have made it almost impossible for the

Claimants to show how the Concessionaire could or would have made use of

that lost opportunity. As already decided by the Tribunal above, it would be

wrong in principle to deprive or diminish the Claimants of the monetary value

of that lost opportunity on lack of evidential grounds when that lack of

evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent’s own wrongs. This is not

therefore a case where the burden of proof lay exclusively on the Claimants:

and, in the Tribunal’s view, it was also for the Respondent to prove the

contrary. It did not do so.”?°?

. Dr. Ripinsky, on the other hand, states in his expert report:

“[Flundamental uncertainties existing at the date of valuation cannot be
resolved by a tribunal by predicting ‘how things would have evolved in the
absence of the breach.’ Rather, the task of ascertaining the fair market value
at a given date of valuation requires arbitrators to view these uncertainties
as the part of the factual matrix existing as of that date. If these fundamental
uncertainties cannot be resolved in favour of the claimant on the basis of the
applicable standard of proof, this should preclude reliance on the DCF
method.

[Note 48] The point is sometimes made that where a State is to blame for a
project’s interruption, the claimant should be given the benefit of doubt in
respect of any uncertainty in determining what exactly would have happened
in the absence of a breach. This position does not seem to be methodologically
correct from the point of view of the burden and standard of proof, nor does
it respect the task of determining the FMV as of a certain date (i.e. on the
basis of facts available as of that date).”??*

In the Tribunal’s view, it is not sensible to discuss this point in the abstract. For the
reasons set out below, the Tribunal considers that, in principle, the information and
evidence presented by Claimant provide a reasonable and sufficient basis to determine
the value of Claimant’s investment using an income-based valuation method. In other
words, the Tribunal does not consider that there are “fundamental uncertainties” that
would preclude the application of a DCF method or, more precisely, the application of
the modern DCF method used by Prof. Davis. This does not yet mean that the Tribunal
agrees with each of the individual assumptions and risk estimates made by Prof. Davis in
the course of his valuation. Should the Tribunal reach the conclusion that certain risks or
uncertainties have not been sufficiently accounted for, it will also assess whether, in that
specific context, there is an evidentiary uncertainty which has been caused by Respondent
and might therefore justify alleviating Claimant’s burden of proof.

In general, however, the Tribunal finds that these considerations may not serve to reverse
the fundamental principle that Claimant bears the burden of proving its damage, including
the quantum of its damage, and therefore also bears the consequences if and to the extent
it is not able to meet this burden of proof.

d. Appropriate Valuation Method

Having set out the applicable legal standards in general, the Tribunal will now turn to the
valuation methods presented by the Parties and assess whether it is appropriate to rely on
any of these methods in the circumstances of the present case.

to throughout these proceedings as the “modern DCF” method — a term that the Tribunal
will therefore adopt in the following analysis. Respondent has relied on two sets of
valuation experts: (i) Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells who were instructed to discuss the
appropriateness of a DCF valuation in general and the valuation presented by Prof. Davis
in particular but did not present a valuation of their own of the Reko Diq project; and (ii)
Dr. Burrows who valued the Reko Dig project based on the past transactions through
which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired their (indirect) shares in Claimant in 2006.

Consequently, the Tribunal has two valuations before it, i.e., the income-based modern
DCF valuation performed by Prof. Davis and the past-transactions-based valuation
performed by Dr. Burrows. The Tribunal further takes note of Respondent’s statement
that “the valuation submitted by Pakistan through the independent expert Dr. Burrows
intends to challenge, and not to cure, the procedural and scientific defects of TCC’s case

on quantum, which under applicable law should be dismissed by the Tribunal.”?**

On that basis, the Tribunal will first and foremost assess whether Claimant has established
that it is appropriate to use a modern DCF valuation in the circumstances of the present
case. If and to the extent the Tribunal follows Claimant and its expert on this point, it will
further assess, once the Tribunal has drawn its own conclusion on the value of the Reko
Digq project based on that method, whether there are reasonable grounds for any remaining
deviation to the result produced by Dr. Burrows’ method.

As for the modern DCF method applied by Prof. Davis, there are two main aspects in
dispute between the Parties: (i) whether it is appropriate in general to use an income-
based DCF valuation for a development-stage mining project in the circumstances of
Reko Digq; and (ii) whether it is appropriate to use the modern DCF method, which is in
principle also a DCF valuation but, as explained by Prof. Davis, uses at-source pricing of
risk and simulates certain project variables to incorporate managerial flexibility while

then discounting cash flows at a risk-free rate.?”>

The Tribunal will address these two aspects in turn.
i. Whether It Is Appropriate to Value the Reko Diq Project Based on a
Projection of Future Cash Flows

At the outset of its analysis regarding the appropriateness of using a DCF valuation in
this case, the Tribunal notes that there is agreement between the Parties that this question
cannot be answered in the abstract, i.e., for any given development-stage project at a

certain defined stage. In response to Claimant’s denial of a “bright-line rule” that
Respondent allegedly invoked,”° Respondent agreed with the “truism” that “the
applicability of DCF methodology is decided on the facts of each case” but argued that
Claimant had failed to establish the facts leading to the applicability of a DCF analysis,
ie., facts proving “profitability or sufficient certainty of the viability of the project into

the future.”?9"

The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the analysis which valuation method is
appropriate to value a project can only be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into
account all relevant circumstances of the case and the evidence that the Parties have
brought before this Tribunal. As stated by the Crystallex tribunal:

“[T]here is no one methodology best suited for determining the fair market
value of the investment lost in every situation. Tribunals may consider any
techniques or methods of valuation that are generally acceptable in the
financial community, and whether a particular method is appropriate to
utilize is based on the circumstances of each individual case. A tribunal will
thus select the appropriate method basing its decision on the circumstances
of each individual case, mainly because a value is less an actual fact than the
expression of an opinion based on the set of facts before the expert, the
appraiser or the tribunal.”

. The Tribunal agrees with this statement and can therefore assess no more and no less than

whether it is appropriate to determine the value of the Reko Diq project as of 15
November 2011 based on a projection of the project’s future cash flows. At the same
time, the Tribunal still considers it useful to take guidance from the findings made by
other tribunals faced with the question how to value a non-operational mining project. In
their submissions, the Parties relied, inter alia, on four recent cases concerning non-
operational mining projects which, as assessed by Dr. Ripinsky, “are to some extent
comparable to the Tethyan case in terms of their factual background” as they were
“stopped due to government intervention before entering the exploitation stage or shortly

thereafter.”?”

Claimant relies in particular on the findings made by the tribunals in Gold Reserve v.
Venezuela and Crystallex v. Venezuela. In Gold Reserve, the tribunal held:

“Although the Brisas Project was never a functioning mine and therefore did
not have a history of cashflow which would lend itself to the DCF model, the
Tribunal accepts the explanation of both Dr Burrows (CRA) and Mr

Kaczmarek (Navigant) that a DCF method can be reliably used in the instant
case because of the commodity nature of the product and detailed mining
cashflow analysis previously performed. The Tribunal also notes that the
experts agreed on the DCF model used, and it is only the inputs that are
contested.”*°°

In that case, the claimant had also presented a comparables valuation which was contested
by the respondent. In that context, the Gold Reserve tribunal added:

“The Tribunal notes that the DCF method is a preferred method of valuation
where sufficient data is available. This conclusion is supported by the CIMVal
Guidelines ... to which both experts referred. In the present cases, many of
the arguments in favour of a DCF approach (a commodity product for which
data such as reserves and price are easily calculated) mitigates against
introducing other methods such as comparable transactions or market
capitalization, unless close comparables can be found. On several occasions
in this Award, the Tribunal has rejected a comparable with other mines on
the basis that many variables are specific to each mine (such as climatic and
geological conditions) all of which have an impact on value. ... Although the
Tribunal appreciates Claimant’s concern that the DCF model can be over-
sensitive to changes in inputs, the Tribunal is not convinced that the
comparables offered are sufficiently similar to enable then [sic] to be used in
a weighted valuation calculation. Because of this uncertainty, the Tribunal
prefers to use the DCF model only.”*"!
The tribunal did not, however, decide to ignore the comparables approach but used it as
“a cross-reference as to the reasonableness of the DCF valuation.” It noted that “the
comparables were in a close range, suggesting the DCF value was reasonably accurate”
and also referred to other valuations from independent analysists, which it considered

“useful references to ensure that the compensation awarded is reasonable.”*°

Dr. Burrows, who had also appeared as the respondent’s expert in Gold Reserve, had
presented a negative valuation of the project. The Gold Reserve tribunal did not consider
this valuation convincing because “[t]his would essentially mean that the mine was
completely uneconomic to operate — a highly unlikely proposition given the effort and
expense to which Gold Reserve had committed to get the mine operational. The detailed
feasibility study and various impact studies all demonstrated that the level of analysis
that had gone into the mine was significant.” The tribunal further noted that the claimant’ s
valuation was consistent with other indendent valuations and bore “reasonably proximity

to the comparables methodologies.” The tribunal also considered it unlikely that the
claimant would have proceded with the venture if it had become uneconomic. In addition,
it took note of the fact that financing had been arranged for the project, “indicating that a
convincing business case had been made to obtain the debt.”*® On that basis, the tribunal
decided to generally prefer the methodology and evidence advanced by the claimant’s
expert.

In Crystallex, the tribunal found that the claimant had “established the fact of future
profitability, as it had completed the exploration phase, the size of the deposits had been
established, the value can be determined based on market prices, and the costs are well
known in the industry and can be estimated with a sufficient degree of certainty.” The
tribunal made reference to the feasibility studies produced by the claimant and noted that
it saw “no reason to cast into doubt the accuracy of the studies that those well-known
consultants prepared contemporaneously for the Claimant throughout the years.” It
further held that “‘gold, unlike most consumer products or even other commodities, is less
subject to ordinary supply-demand dynamics or market fluctuations, and, especially in
the case of open pit gold mining as in Las Cristinas, is an asset whose costs and future
profits can be estimated with greater certainty.” The tribunal therefore accepted that
“predicting future income from ascertained reserves to be extracted by the use of
traditional mining techniques—as is the case of Las Cristinas—can be done with a

significant degree of certainty, even without a record of past production.”>°*

In a second step, the Crystallex tribunal assessed whether the claimant had provided it
with a reasonable basis to assess the loss of profits and noted that the claimant had
presented several forward-looking methodologies whereas the respondent had presented
a backward-looking cost approach. It then held:

“The Tribunal considers that in this case only forward-looking methodologies
aimed at calculating lost profits are appropriate in order to determine the
fair market value of Crystallex’s investment. By contrast, a backward-looking
methodology such as the cost approach, while susceptible of being utilized in
certain instances where there is no record of profitability and other
methodologies would lead to excessively speculative and uncertain results,
cannot be resorted to in this case. The cost approach method would not reflect
the fair market value of the investment, as by definition it only assesses what
has been expended into the project rather than what the market value of the
investment is at the relevant time.”

318. The Crystallex tribunal considered that “[t]he appropriateness of choosing, at least for a
case like this one, a method which aims at determining lost profits and, by contrast, of
discarding methods that are purely based on the computation of sunk costs,’ was
confirmed by the “Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties” issued
by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIMVal), which it
described as “important standards in the industry.” The tribunal referred to the definition
of “development property” in the CIMVal Guidelines and noted that for these properties,
the CIMVal Guidelines “advise in favor of the application of income- and market-based
methodologies, and against the use of cost-based methodologies.”*°° On that basis, the
tribunal decided to consider the four methodologies presented by the claimant and
decided to rely on a stock-market approach and a market multiples approach while
discarding the other two valuation methodologies — none of which was a DCF
methodology.*””

319. Claimant further relied on the tribunal in Rusoro v. Venezuela, which noted that
“[vJaluations based on the DCF method have become usual in investment arbitrations,
whenever the fair market value of an enterprise must be established.” It agreed that
“where the circumstances for its use are appropriate, forward looking DCF has
advantages over other, more backwards looking valuation methods” and held that “DCF
works properly if all, or at least a significant part, of the following criteria are met?>°*

The enterprise has an established historical record of financial

performance;

- There are reliable projections of its future cash flow, ideally in the form
of a detailed business plan adopted in tempore insuspecto, prepared by
the company’s officers and verified by an impartial expert;

- The price at which the enterprise will be able to sell its products or

services can be determined with reasonable certainty;

- The business plan can be financed with self-generated cash, or, if
additional cash is required, there must be no uncertainty regarding the
availability of financing;

- It is possible to calculate a meaningful WACC, including a reasonable
country risk premium, which fairly represents the political risk in the
host country;

- The enterprise is active in a sector with low regulatory pressure, or, if
the regulatory pressure is high, its scope and effects must be
predictable: it should be possible to establish the impact of regulation
on future cash flows with a minimum of certainty.

. The Rusoro tribunal emphasized that DCF did not work in all circumstances and noted

that “[ilf the estimation of those parameters is incorrect, the results will not represent the
actual fair market value of the enterprise. Small adjustments in the estimation can yield
significant divergences in the results.” It therefore considered it necessary that DCF

valuations “be subjected to a ‘sanity check’ against other valuation methodologies.”?'°

The Rusoro tribunal considered that neither of the parties’ experts had in fact presented a
“real DCF valuation” and considered the absence of such a DCF valuation “not an
oversight, but rather the result of the very special characteristics surrounding Rusoro,
which make the use of DCF approach inappropriate.”*"' The tribunal referred to the
following circumstances: (i) the claimant lacked a proven record of financial
performance; (ii) the price of gold was very volatile and the expropriation occurred when
gold was of its two historic peaks, which made it difficult to recreate market expectations
on the expropriation date; (iii) there was no certainty whether the claimant would have
been able to secure the financing for the required investment projected in its business
plan; (iv) the country risk advocated by the claimant’s expert was “clearly too low” and
the WACC proposed by the respondent’s expert was considered too high; (v) the
Venezuelan gold sector had suffered increasing regulatory pressure which made it
impossible to predict “with any certainty’ the impact on future cash flows; and (vi) the
claimant’s mining rights had a definite term and while the DCF model assumed renewal,
the tribunal had “significant doubts” whether that would be the case “given the

uncertainty surrounding Venezuela.”?'?

The Rusoro tribunal therefore concluded that the DCF valuation was “not an appropriate

basis for calculating the ‘genuine value’ of Rusoro.”>"*

323. In Khan Resources v. Mongolia, the tribunal was presented with three different

324.

325.

326.

methodologies by the parties’ experts, including a DCF valuation advocated by the
claimants. The tribunal first agreed with the claimants that “in the case of a mine with
proven reserves, the DCF method is often considered an appropriate methodology for
calculating fair market value” but then held that “a number of additional factors and
uncertainties” made the use of the DCF method “unattractive and speculative” in the case

before it.°'* The Khan Resources tribunal then specified that these “uncertainties”
included: (i) how the project would have been financed; (ii) whether a strategic partner
would have been brought in or whether the claimant would have been able to bring the
project into production by itself; (iii) whether the claimant would have taken the project
to production or sold it; (iv) when and how certain additional property would have been
merged into the joint venture; and (v) the signing of various agreement such as an
investment agreement and a new joint venture agreement “to finalise the commercial

terms” of the project.?'>

The Khan Resources tribunal did not agree with the respondent that these factors rendered
the project worthless in the claimant’s hands but held that “[t]he combination of these
factors ... does mean that the level of certainty required for the DCF method to be used
has not been attained.” In particular, the tribunal considered it “far from certain: (i)
whether the mine would actually have reached production; (ii) if it did, on what terms the
parties would have participated in the venture; and (iii) whether the Claimants would
still have been involved in the Dornod Project at all.” It therefore concluded that “the
DCF method is inappropriate and that any damages calculated through it would be too

speculative.”*'®

The Khan Resources tribunal did not adopt any of the three methodologies presented by
the parties’ experts but considered that “the true value of Khan’s investment is better
reflected by the offers made for the mine or for Khan Canada’s shares in and around the

relevant period than by the more traditional methodologies advanced by the Parties.”3"7

The Tribunal notes that the Parties also made repeated reference to the award rendered in
Bear Creek v. Peru. In that case, the claimant had also presented a valuation calculated
by the DCF method and the tribunal assessed whether “having regard to the factual
circumstances of this case, a willing buyer might have been found who would have paid

a price calculated by the DCF method, as Claimant alleges.” It answered this question in
the negative, stating:

“The Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimant has provided sufficient
evidence in support of its claim that a hypothetical purchaser of the Santa
Ana Project would have been able to obtain the necessary social license to
be able to proceed with the Project, if it had been provided an opportunity to
invest the necessary time and resources. Given the extent of the opposition,
and the reasons for it, the Tribunal doubts that the Project could, in the short
term at least, be considered to be viable by the time Supreme Decree 032 [i.e.,
the measure which the tribunal found to be in violation of the respondent’s
obligations under the treaty] was adopted.

The Tribunal notes that the Santa Ana Project was still at an early stage and
that it had not received many of the government approvals and environmental
permits it needed to proceed. On the basis of the evidence before it, the
Tribunal concludes that there was little prospect for the Project to obtain the
necessary social license to allow it to proceed to operation, even assuming it
had received all necessary environmental and other permits. The Tribunal
notes that no similar projects operated in the same area, and there was no
evidence to support a track record of successful operation or profitability in
the future.”?'®

327. The Bear Creek tribunal also made reference to the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina,
which held:

“In the Tribunal’s view, the likelihood of lost profits must be sufficiently
established by Claimants in order to be the basis of compensable damages.
The Tribunal also recognises that in an appropriate case, a claimant might
be able to establish the likelihood of lost profits with sufficient certainty even
in the absence of a genuine going concern. For example, a claimant might be
able to establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession, would have
been profitable by presenting sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven
record of profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in
similar circumstances.”>!

328. The Vivendi tribunal found that the claimant had failed to establish “with a sufficient
degree of certainty” that the concession in question would have been profitable because
the claimant had “never made a profit whilst it had operational control of the concession.”
It again noted that “the absence of a history of demonstrated profitability does not
absolutely preclude the use of DCF valuation methodology. But to overcome the hurdle
of its absence, a claimant must lead convincing evidence of its ability to produce profits

in the particular circumstances it faced.”*”° It concluded that the evidence adduced by
the claimants in this regard was deficient because in the absence of a record of
demonstrated profitability of the project itself, the claimants would have been required
“to present a thoroughly prepared record of its (or others) successes, based on first hand
experience (its own or that of qualified experts) or corporate records which establish on
the balance of the probabilities it would have produced profits from the concession in
question in the face of the particular risks involved, other than those of Treaty

violation.”>*!

Respondent’s expert Dr. Ripinsky stated in his expert report that while, as a general rule,
a DCF calculation requires a proven track record of performance, it “appears to be
acceptable where ... the claimant is able to establish with sufficient certainty the principal
assumptions and parameters in its DCF model despite the absence of a track record.”**
He concluded from his review of recent awards concerning mining ventures that “the
application of the DCF method to a mining project at an early stage requires several
important fundamentals to be in place as at the date of valuation, such as inter alia the
existence of confirmed financing necessary for the project as well as clarity about the

 

commercial terms of o} ion and a detailed (independently-verified) busi plan.” In

addition, Dr. Ripinsky considered that “technological, logistical, infrastructure,

regulatory and other risks” could also constitute “fundamental uncertainties” which

generally preclude reliance on the DCF method.*?*

In the Tribunal’s view, a review of recent case law, including but not limited to the cases
set out in more detail above, confirms that the question whether a DCF method (or a
similar income-based valuation methodology) can be applied to value a project which has
not yet become operational depends strongly on the circumstances of the individual case.
The first key question is whether, based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is
convinced that in the absence of Respondent’s breaches, the project would have become
operational and would also have become profitable. The second key question is whether
the Tribunal is convinced that it can, with reasonable confidence, determine the amount
of these profits based on the inputs provided by the Parties’ experts for this calculation.
Tf the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that there are “fundamental uncertainties” due to
which it is not convinced that the project would have reached the operational stage and
would have been able to generate profits, it cannot apply the DCF method. If it reaches
the conclusion that no such “fundamental uncertainties” preclude reliance on the DCF

method but is not convinced by the inputs provided by the Parties’ experts, it may
conclude that it cannot apply the DCF method or it may conclude that certain deductions
have to be made to account for additional risks or uncertainties faced by the project.

As for the first question, the Tribunal considers that for the reasons to be set out in more
detail below, Claimant has established that if Respondent had not denied TCCP’s Mining
Lease Application in violation of Respondent’s obligation under the Treaty, the Reko Diq
project would have gone forward and become operational and profitable in due course.
More specifically, the Tribunal is convinced that based on the Feasibility Study that
Claimant delivered to the GOB on 26 August 2010 and the commitment shown by
Claimant as well as its two owners, Antofagasta and Barrick, Claimant would have been
able to obtain the necessary funds and would also have brought the necessary experience
to successfully execute the project in Balochistan.

In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent’s allegation that the Feasibility
Study “was a blueprint for another Mega Project failure.”*** In the Tribunal’s view, the
fact that the Feasibility Study was produced at a time when Claimant and its owners were
determined to proceed with the project and the fact that its owners combined their
impressive experience in operating copper mines and in operating gold mines across the
globe, had been sponsoring and overseeing the project during its exploration stage, and
were willing to contribute large further amounts of equity into the project, are very strong
indications that they believed that this project would become operational and profitable.
The Feasibility Study itself was the result of several years of intensive work on the
ground, which was overseen by both of Claimant’s owners and in which numerous
outside consultants and companies participated. To suggest that the team conducting the
exploration work and compiling the Feasibility Study had no idea what they were doing
is not credible, in particular considering that Antofagasta and Barrick were investing large
amounts of equity as well as seconding their own personnel for the project.

This does not mean that the Tribunal intends to brush off the risks and issues pointed out
by Respondent, in particular the risks associated with water, security and a social license
to operate, or that the Tribunal necessarily follows each assumption made by Claimant
and its expert on the costs associated with these risks. The Tribunal also takes note of a
remaining uncertainty whether and, if so on what terms, Claimant would have concluded
a Mineral Agreement with the Governments. However, the Tribunal considers it
established that neither of these risks or uncertainties constitutes a “fundamental
uncertainty” that would have stopped the project or rendered it unprofitable.

Consequently, the second question is whether the inputs for a DCF calculation presented
by the Parties’ experts provide the Tribunal with a reasonable basis to determine the future

cash flows of Claimant’s investment with a reasonable amount of confidence. In this
regard, the Tribunal notes that while Respondent’s experts have criticized numerous
assumptions and inputs used by Prof. Davis, they have in most cases not provided the
Tribunal with what they would consider adequate inputs and they have not performed
their own DCF calculation. While they purported to convert Prof. Davis’ analysis to a
traditional DCF to demonstrate that the internal rate of return would be too low for an

325

investor,’ the Tribunal is not convinced that this was an adequate conversion and could

be used for comparison purposes.

As will be set out in more detail below, the Tribunal considers that certain adjustments
have to be made to the inputs used by Prof. Davis in his calculation. In the Tribunal’ s
view, however, none of these adjustments warrants the conclusion that the DCF method
cannot produce a sufficiently reliable result. To the contrary, the Tribunal is convinced
that in the particular circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to assume that Claimant’s
investment would have become profitable and to determine these future profits by using
a DCF method.

ii. Whether It Is Appropriate to Value the Reko Diq Project Based on the
Modern DCF Method Presented by Claimant

Having reached a conclusion on the appropriateness to determine the value of Claimant’s
investment by using a forward-looking DCF methodology, the Tribunal will now assess
whether Claimant has also established that the Tribunal should use the modern DCF
approach used by its expert Prof. Davis.

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that neither Party has presented a valuation based on a
traditional DCF analysis conducted for the purposes of this arbitration with inputs as of
the valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells merely referred to the “conventional
DCF calculations of the SNC-Lavalin analyses” completed in 2010 and, without updating
them to the valuation date, concluded on their basis that “the project would not attract a
rational private investor and therefore has a Fair Market Value of zero.”*?6 In the
Tribunal’s view, the conclusion that the project did not have any value is simply not
credible. The Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study had confirmed that
Reko Diq contained enormous mineral resources and had further demonstrated how these
could be extracted and processed to be sold on the metals markets. Contemporaneous
statements made by Government officials as well as by Dr. Mubarakmand who led the
GOB’s own project demonstrate that the Governments shared the belief at the time that
the mine was going to be very lucrative and attractive commercially. Based on the results
of the Feasibility and Pre-Feasibility Studies, Claimant and its owners were willing to

commit substantial financial and personnel resources in order to bring this project into
operation.

338. In the Tribunal’s view, the only reliable indication of the result that a traditional DCF
analysis might have produced if it had been performed is Prof. Davis’ update of the
calculation included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility. According to Prof. Davis, his
update of prices and costs to reflect conditions as of the valuation date yielded a net
present value of USD 3.02 billion for Claimant’s share of the project.*?” By contrast, the

modern DCF method he applied resulted in a net present value of USD 8.5 billion.*7*

339. The Tribunal does not consider it established that a traditional DCF calculation conducted
for this arbitration would have necessarily produced the same result as the updated
calculation from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which was performed for a
different purpose and did not aim at calculating the fair market value of the project.
However, given that the Tribunal has not been provided with a traditional DCF
calculation, or any other income-based calculation for that matter, it will bear the result
of this calculation in mind when verifying whether its conclusion on the value of
Claimant’s investment is reasonable and reconcilable with other indications of value at
the time.

340. As for the modern DCF valuation presented by Claimant, the Tribunal takes note of Prof.
Davis’ explanation as to why he considers that the modern DCF method is superior to the
traditional DCF method specifically for long-life projects in the mining sector. In his
view, there are “four main shortcomings of the traditional DCF method when applied to
to calculating the fair market valuation of mining projects”: (i) there is no market-based
information for the main price and cost drivers of the project for 50 years or more into
the future; (ii) there is no reasonable way of knowing how the market would discount the
risk in each cash flow for a specific mining project but the standard approach uses market
signals from the industry as a whole and uses a constant risk-adjusted discount rate which
compounds over the years even though the risk of long-life mining projects is more or
less constant over time; (iii) the method underestimates the project’s tax cash flows and
therefore overestimates net cash flows; and (iv) there is no simulation accounting for the
possibility of the project’s managers to respond to changing conditions by making

appropriate operational decisions.*”?

341. In particular with regard to the second alleged shortcoming, Prof. Davis illustrated the
effect of using a risk-adjusted, compounding discount rate for a project that expects to
receive cash flows over 50 years into the future as follows:

342. Prof. Davis then explained the advantages of the modern DCF method as follows:

“The modern DCF method overcomes these limitations in cash flow
estimation and cash flow risk discounting through two innovations. First, it
uses forward market transactions as a signal of market participants’
expectations about future mining prices and costs along with their risk
preferences over the uncertainty in those prices and costs. Second, it
simulates over a wide range of possible cash flow outcomes in order to
correctly capture the varying impacts of taxes and managerial actions on the
project’s expected net cash flows. The use of forward markets to assess
project cash flow risk is the most profound change, doing away with the
overall, exogenously imposed and often highly contentious project level
discount rate. In this sense it is a true market-based approach that provides
a market asset valuation, exactly what is desired for a FMV.”>°

343. In short, Prof. Davis stated that he applied at-source pricing of risk using forward markets,
thereby avoiding the use of a constant risk-adjusted discount rate, and simulated key
project variables to capture the impact of taxes and of active management decisions on

cash flows and thereby project value. As he considers to have included all relevant risks

in the cash flows themselves, he discounts the cash flows at the risk-free rate.?*!

Respondent’s experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells recognized that “there are elements
of the model that are useful, like the probability distributions of several key indicators.”
In their view, however, the model conceals the “fragility” of the project because it uses
an average of all simulations and ignores, for example, the significant probability of a
negative NPV.* They also question whether the model actually performs a risk
adjustment at source and deny that the projections made by Prof. Davis based on futures
prices actually result in risk-adjusted prices and argue that these are in fact higher than
non-adjusted price forecasts made by Consensus Economics. On that basis, they also
consider it inappropriate to discount the calculated cash flows based on a risk-free rate.>*7
In their view, the lack of adequate risk adjustments is confirmed by a comparison to the
studies conducted by SNC Lavalin, in particular the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study,
which undisputedly does not contain at-source risk adjustments.**+ Following further
explanation, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells conclude that “the valuation presented by
Claimant as ‘modern’ is really very little more than the traditional DCF approach with

an inflated price of output and a discount rate equal to the risk-free rate.”**°

It appears to the Tribunal that the main issue in dispute between the Parties’ experts is
whether the modern DCF method accurately accounts for all the risks associated with a
project and whether it is therefore reasonable to discount the risk-adjusted cash flows only
for the time value of money, i.e., by using a risk-free rate.

Prof. Davis explained that the modern DCF model permits to distinguish between: (i)
systematic risks, such as production quantities and copper, gold and oil prices which may
go up but may also go down; and (ii) asymmetric risks, such as a terrorist attack on the
project which may affect the project without any upside potential. According to Prof.
Davis, the modern DCF method accounts for asymmetric risks by adjusting the cash flow
components affected by these risks such that they reflect the statistically expected
outcome, e.g., a certain probability that a terrorist attack will occur. As for systematic
risk, he explained that production quantities in mines generally do not require an
adjustment for uncertainty and that for copper and gold prices, the modern DCF can resort

to “very good market signals as to how the market values such risks.”°°

347. In response to Respondent’s argument that the modern DCF method is not used in the

348.

349.

mining industry, Prof. Davis referred to a letter sent by the Special Committee of the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum on Valuation of Mineral
Properties (CIMVal) to the International Valuation Standards Council in response to
certain questions the latter had raised in a discussion paper in 2012.*7 The Tribunal
considers it common ground that CIMVal, which is comprised of experts in mineral
project valuation, and that the Standards and Guidelines it issues, reflect international best
practices.

The Tribunal attaches importance to the CIMVal opinion because it is good evidence of
the valuation methodology likely in practice to have been used by an actual buyer in the
limited market for large-scale mining enterprises at the relevant time. The Tribunal would
observe that it is not engaged in applying rules of valuation claimed to be derived from
decisions in other cases. Nor is it concerned with what an expert, however eminent,
considers would have been the best method of valuation. Its task is to make the best
estimation of what, on the assumption that Respondent had honored its Treaty obligations,
would actually have happened if Reko Dig had been offered for sale in the open market.
Tf in practice a buyer was most likely to have adopted the methodology recommended in
the CIMVal opinion, it is irrelevant that an expert considers that some other methodology
would have been better. The Tribunal therefore considers it worth reviewing the CIMVal
opinion on the modern DCF approach in more detail.

As for general valuation methods to be used, CIMVal confirmed that for “Reserves
undergoing development,” it most commonly uses or encounters the income approach.
For “Reserves and resources subject to exploration”, it distinguished between early stage
exploration properties and more advanced stage exploration properties “where there is at
least a preliminary information on mine design, technical feasibility, and geological
information on structure, material amount and metal concentration of the deposit.”*** In
the Tribunal’s view, the Reko Dig project would satisfy at least the definition of an
advanced stage exploration property, for which CIMVal most commonly uses or
encounters market or income approaches.

CIMVal then described two types of income-based approaches: (i) a “standard” DCF
approach; and (ii) a “Certainty-Equivalent” DCF approach, which corresponds to what
Prof. Davis has labelled the “modern DCF” approach:

unsystematic risks. Davis II, 45. This category of risks did not form the subject of dispute between the Parties’
experts.

“We generally use the income approach where there is sufficient information
available to estimate future cash flows generated by a metals-related
investment. ...

An income-based valuation framework is applied across all of these asset-
types in a manner that conforms to generally accepted valuation principles
and, depending on the situation, is consistent with valuation principles in
accounting guidelines such as IFRS. The Discounted Cash Flow (‘DCF’)
method is used to adjust cash flow for risk and timing. However, these
adjustments may be applied in one of two means. The first follows a standard
DCF adjustment where net cash flow is adjusted for risk and time through a
discounting process that relies on an aggregate discount rate. The second is
a Certainty Equivalent (‘CeQ DCF’) approach where a risk-adjusted net cash
flow is calculated by applying a targeted risk adjustment to particular cash
flow component (e.g., a pure copper risk adjustment applied to a copper
based revenue stream). This risk-adjusted net cash flow is then adjusted for
the time value of money and possibly a residual risk adjustment for
uncertainties not explicitly accounted in the cash flow model. ... We may then
augment our cash flow model by modelling metal price and other
uncertainties with a numerical technique (e.g., lattice techniques or
simulation) to correct for biases created in a cash flow estimate by contingent
cash flow structures the result of risk management, management flexibility,
financing and taxation considerations.

 

 

We note that the CeQ DCF approach was not discussed in the Exposure Draft
of the IVSC Technical Information Paper titled ‘The Discounted Cash Flow
(DCF) Method - Real Property and Business Valuations’ even though this
method is a recognized DCF method for fair value estimates under
accounting guidelines and well supported in valuation and finance theory
literature. CeQ DCF is one of the approaches described in IFRS 13. We
would highlight that the structure of the CeQ DCF approach is comparable
to derivative valuation methods used to value many financial assets and is
used for select types of real assets such as natural resource projects.”**?

351. Following a description of other approaches, CIMVal concluded:

“Our experience has been that all of these methods provide valuation results
that are supportable when applied with professionalism and discipline. We
generally do not use a particular method in isolation and generally confirm
the results from one approach with the results from a second approach.

We commonly use DCF and comparable transactions (market approach) for
producing reserves, reserves undergoing development and for reserves
subject to exploration (whatever that means). For resources, we generally
use comparable transactions and for exploration properties without reserves
or resources, we use comparable transactions and the cost approach. As a

valuations that seem to reflect the market.”**°

352. In the context of a more detailed description of its practice in using inputs for a DCF

calculation, CIMVal noted that “[vJery long-life base metal asset may require that long-
term cash flows be explicitly modeled with a CeQ DCF approach because of price
reversion in base metal prices (i.e. the tendency of metal price to revert to a long-term
equilibrium level). This approach may be used if in the particular situation a standard
DCF model with aggregate risk adjustments to the net cash flow has difficulty recognizing

the explicit risk characteristics of a cash flow stream.”*"!

As for the use of forward price curves that Prof. Davis used to derive price inputs for his
model, CIMVal stated:

“We believe that in appropriate circumstances a commodity price forecast

may be derived from its forward price curve. A forward price is the price at

which two parties agree to sell or buy a set amount of commodity at a specific

time in the future. The forward price is considered a risk-adjusted expected

price since a party choosing to buy or sell a commodity in the future would

first need to estimate what the spot price might be and then adjust this

estimated price for variance around the forecast (i.e., applying a risk

adjustment). The risk adjustment is used to back out a forecast commodity

price from a forward curve based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model

(‘CAPM’).”342
CIMVal noted that “some mining professionals oppose the use of forward curves in metal
price forecasts. This opposition is often supported by citing concerns about liquidity,
incomplete forward curves, or the observation that a forward price is a mathematical
calculation.” It explained, however, that “these reasons do not prevent the use of forward
curves in generating a price forecast since they would also invalidate the use of derivative
methods when generating cash flows and estimating value in a wide range of valuation
problems.” It noted that the decision on which information should be used is made on the
facts and circumstances of the valuation problem. It further confirmed that “[m]etal price
forecasts based on the forward curve may be extended beyond the publicly quoted prices
based on the characteristics of the metal (base metal or precious metal) and the market

characteristics of the forward curve.”*8

In the Tribunal’s view, the statements made by CIMVal in its detailed response to the
International Valuation Standards Council are a strong indication that, contrary to
Respondent’s allegation, the certainty-equivalent or modern DCF method applied by
Prof. Davis is a recognized valuation method which is used in the industry for valuing

mining properties in the appropriate circumstances. The Tribunal also considers that the
explanation provided by CIMVal confirms Prof. Davis’ statement as to why the
application of the modern DCF method is reasonable and preferable over a traditional
DCF method for the valuation of the Reko Dig project in the present circumstances. The
Feasibility Study envisaged a 56-year life of the mine.** As indicated in Prof. Davis’
illustration of cash flows calculated under the traditional DCF method, cash flows to be
generated fourty years into the future would have almost no net present value if they were
discounted by a constant, compounding discount rate incorporating all types of risk that
may affect the project. This issue, i.e., that this treatment of risk does not capture the
actual amount of risk because cash flows actually do not become more risky over time
but the risk level remains more or less constant over the life of the mine because base
metal prices tend to revert to a long-term equilibrium level, was specifically identified by
CIMVal as one of the reasons that “may require” the use of a certainty-equivalent or
modern DCF approach as it was applied by Prof. Davis in the present case.

From the Tribunal’s perspective, it further makes sense to distinguish between different
types of risk and adjust each cash flow component directly for the risks that affect this
particular cash flow. While this approach may be associated with some uncertainties, e.g.,
regarding the projection of future metals prices, CIMVal pointed out that these
uncertainties also affect the traditional DCF method and therefore do not justify rejecting
this method or the use of risk-adjusted prices. In the Tribunal’s view, any remaining
uncertainties associated with the adjustment of risks at source are controllable by making
reasonable, and perhaps conservative, assumptions and they are preferable to applying a
discount rate that results in almost no net present value for cash flows that would be
generated in the second half of the mine’s life.

In this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of Prof. Davis’ oral testimony in response to
the question whether the approach he had presented would actually have been used in the
market at the relevant time, i.e., at the valuation date. Mr. Davis responded that it is a
known problem in the industry that the traditional income approach produces results
which the valuer knows to be wrong and that the discount rate is therefore lowered or the
result multiplied if the number is biased low or the other way around if the number is
biased high. He explained that the industry had a demand for valuing an asset of whose
value they had an idea but did not have a tool to get to that value.*“° Prof. Davis concluded
his answer by stating:

“So, I believe these market participants get to their $8.5 billion just in this
case by looking at, perhaps, the traditional and perhaps, the modern. The

modern just is a more direct, I would say, an accurate way of getting to that

number without having to do these little fixes... -- as opposed to the

traditional.”**°

358. While Respondent takes the position that this testimony confirms that the modern DCF

approach permits Claimant to arrive at a predetermined value, the Tribunal considers that
the opposite is in fact the case. Prof. Davis explained that the methodology he uses has
been developed precisely in order to avoid the practical “fixes” that are sometimes used
the industry in order to arrive at a value within the range of what they consider reasonable.
Specifically in the present case, the method does away with the need to “fix” the fact that
a compounding risk-adjusted discount rate eliminates any net present value of cash flows
in the second half of the mine’s life by instead using a scientific approach to adjust the
risk at source.

359. The Tribunal is aware of Respondent’s argument, which appears to be undisputed by
Claimant, that the certainty-equivalent or modern DCF approach has so far not been
adopted by any investment arbitration tribunal in determining the amount of damages
owed to a claimant that suffered an expropriation of a mining project. It further appears
to be undisputed that there was only one case in which a modern DCF approach was
presented by one of the parties, i.e., by the respondent in Bear Creek v. Peru. In that case,
it was presented as a comparison to the traditional DCF calculation presented by the
claimant. As the tribunal in that case did not consider it appropriate to value the claimant’s
investment based on an income-based methodology, it did not express an opinion on the
modern DCF approach.

360. In any event, however, the Tribunal considers that the absence of investment treaty
jurisprudence — affirmative or negative — does not in itself constitute a valid ground for
rejecting a valuation method if the Tribunal is otherwise convinced that it is sound to
apply it in the present case. As valuation practices for mineral properties develop in the
industry itself, the assessment of damages may likewise evolve in investment treaty
arbitration. As correctly pointed out by Claimant, the use of the traditional DCF method
was even rejected in early jurisprudence but then became more and more common and
established for the assessment of damages in investment treaty arbitration. The Tribunal
also recalls that the appropriate valuation method can only be selected in the
circumstances of each individual case and based on the submissions and evidence brought
before the respective tribunal.

361.

Based on its review of the evidentiary record, the Tribunal concludes that it is appropriate
to value Claimant’s investment in the Reko Diq project by using the modern DCF
approach presented by Claimant and its expert Prof. Davis. This does not yet mean that it

also agrees with Prof. Davis that each of the risk adjustments he has made is sufficient to
account for the risks and uncertainties raised by Respondent. These aspects will be
addressed in more detail below.

The Tribunal will also assess whether Prof. Davis has used reasonable inputs to account
for systematic risks, in particular regarding the development of copper and gold prices.
The Tribunal notes that CIMVal generally supports the use of forward curves, including
their extension beyond publicly quoted prices. The Tribunal therefore does not follow
Respondent’s general rejection of using forward curves as a basis for projecting risk-
adjusted prices. However, the Tribunal will assess whether it is established that the risk
adjustment made by Prof. Davis is sufficient. In that context, the Tribunal will also
address the comparison drawn by Respondent’s experts to the DCF calculation in the
Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study which undisputedly used non-
adjusted prices.

In addition, the Tribunal will address the argument raised by Respondent and its expert
that it was incorrect for Prof. Davis to use a risk-free rate to discount the cash flows
because these cash flows are not, or at least not fully, adjusted for risk. In this regard, the
Tribunal also takes note of CIMVal’s explanation in the context of selecting discount
rates for valuing reserves and resources that the certainty-equivalent DCF approach “does
not make use of an aggregate discount rate though an implied aggregate discount rate
can be derived’ but instead “uses targeted risk-adjustments for select cash flow
components. These adjustments are done within the CAPM framework. Market related
uncertainties such as metal and energy prices are risk-adjusted with the CAPM while
project-specific uncertainties may be modelled directly with no risk-adjustment.”**” At
the same time, CIMVal stated:
“A residual risk adjustment may be necessary to adjust previously risk-
adjusted cash flows for risk not explicitly recognized in the model before a
final adjustment for the time value of money. The residual risk adjustment is
similar in nature to a Credit Valuation Adjustment applied in derivative
valuation for counter-party risk.”*48

As confirmed by CIMVal, the Tribunal agrees with Prof. Davis that it is, in principle,
consistent to use a risk-free rate which discounts cash flows only for the time value of
money, if they have already been fully adjusted for risk. However, in line with the
explanation provided by CIMVal, the Tribunal will assess whether it may be necessary
to apply a residual risk adjustment for risk not explicitly or not sufficiently recognized in
Prof. Davis’ model.

explained that generally a valuation method should not be used in isolation but should be
confirmed by the results of a second approach. As already noted above, the Tribunal has
not been presented with many alternatives for this purpose. It will nevertheless verify at
the end of its analysis whether the conclusion it has reached based on the modern DCF
approach used by Prof. Davis is reconcilable with the other valuations and/or indications
of value of the project that have been brought before this Tribunal.

Impact of the Risks and Issues Raised by Respondent on the Feasibility of the
Project and/or the Value of Claimant’s Investment

Having determined the relevant legal standards, the Tribunal will now assess whether
Claimant has established that it would have concluded a Mineral Agreement with the
Federal and Provincial Governments and, if so, the terms on which such an agreement
would likely have been concluded. The Tribunal will further examine whether Claimant
has established the feasibility of the project and address the various risks and issues raised
by Respondent in this last phase of the arbitration proceedings. As the Tribunal has
decided, in principle, to follow the valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, it will also
assess whether Prof. Davis has appropriately accounted for each of these risks in his
valuation of the project.

The Tribunal will address each of these issues in turn.

Whether Claimant Has Established That It Would Have Concluded a Mineral
Agreement with the Governments on the Terms Assumed in the Valuation

First, the Tribunal will assess whether Claimant has established that it would have
concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Provincial and Federal Governments and, if so,
whether this Agreement would have been concluded on the terms that Prof. Davis was
instructed to assume in his valuation.

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

Claimant takes the position that if the Governments had continued to negotiate in good
faith, the parties would have entered into a “mutually beneficial and commercially
reasonable” Mineral Agreement and the question remained only on what terms.*?
According to Claimant, an agreement would most likely have been reached in 2009 but,
in any event, “almost certainly” after Claimant had secured the mining lease because, as
found by the Tribunal, it would have been in “a far better bargaining position as holder

of the mining lease over the area than it was before” and there would have been “a mutual

interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues.”*° Claimant further claims that
the fiscal terms included in Prof. Davis’ model are “a fair basis for estimating the terms
that would have applied to the Reko Dig project’ in the absence of Balochistan’s unlawful
decision “not to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholders agreements with
TCcP.”!

370. Claimant notes that before the takeover decision, the parties made progress in the Mineral
Agreement negotiations and all three parties were committed to reaching “a mutually
agreeable deal.” Claimant points out that “Pakistan’s key negotiator,’ Mr. Khokhar,
stated in March 2009 that “about 85% work on [the draft Mineral Agreement] has been
completed.”*>* Claimant also rejects the allegation that TCCA backed away from
negotiations in October 2008, which it considers to be contradicted by the
contemporaneous record, and points to a number of proposals, which it continued to make
in 2009, such as: (i) an enhanced sliding-scale royalty; (ii) “a custom suite of tax
concessions” instead of the EPZ regime; (iii) restructuring of Balochistan’s interest as a
net profit interest; (iv) payment of USD 1 million towards a feasibility study for
Balochistan’s proposed smelter; and (v) a Social Investment Plan involving an investment
of USD 100 million.*?

371. Claimant adds that that while it continued to engage with the Governments and make
updated proposals until October 2010, the Governments had decided to develop their own
project and, as the Tribunal already found, after the takeover decision, “no actual
negotiations took place but only high-level meetings in which Claimant was assured that
there was no competing project.”*** According to Claimant, “[t]he documentary record
thus leaves no doubt that the failure of the negotiations is directly attributable to

Balochistan’s illegal takeover decision.”*>°

372. Claimant rejects the argument that it impaired the negotiations through “its own heavy-
handed actions” or that it asked federal officials to force the GOB into an agreement or
that it sought to “push the GoB aside.” It also denies that the concessions it was seeking
were aimed at eliminating the application of the 2002 BM Rules. In addition, Claimant
rejects the allegation that it had abandoned the negotiations or did not expect a Mineral

Agreement given the uncertainty recognized in the Feasiblity Study, arguing that this risk
assessment was made after Balochistan had already decided to take over Reko Diq.**°

Claimant argues that at the time the negotiations were abandoned due to the takeover
decision of the GOB, the parties had already reached agreement “on the most fundamental
issue, namely that the fiscal regime could and would be stabilized.” Claimant bases this
argument on contemporaneous statements made by the Steering Committee for the
Development of Reko Diq Gold-Copper Project (the “Steering Committee”) as well as
by Mr. Khokhar and contends that “[t]here is no evidence that Balochistan ever changed
its position on stability following that agreement.”**’ According to Claimant, entering
into a stability agreement would also have been consistent with assurances received by
Claimant from “the highest levels of Government” as well as the Governments’ history
and policy of entering into similar agreements with other investors.*°*

Claimant also submits that its proposals were based on the understanding that the
Governments intended to further modernize their regulatory regime and notes that the
amendments it had proposed in the negotiations were in fact implemented in the 2013
National Mineral Policy which declared that mineral agreements should have “overriding
effect in case anything contained therein is inconsistent with any law or rules
subsequently amended” and provided that “[t]he existing Mineral Rules will be amended
to remove any conflict/overlapping with or other effect on, and to give effect to, the rights
and obligations of the mining company under the mineral agreement in line with best
international practices.”*°? Claimant points to the Tribunal’s previous finding that in the
negotiations, Claimant desired “to correct a ‘defect’ in the 2002 BM Rules,” which was
then “identified and corrected ... in [the] 2013 NMP.”>°

According to Claimant, stabilization of the fiscal regime “was its primary objective and
was far more important than any single concession.” Claimant argues that once it had
secured stability, it was willing to compromise on specific tax and royalty rates and would

therefore have reached a “mutually beneficial agreement” with the Goverments.*°!

Claimant adds that once it would have received a Mining Lease, the Governments would
have had “a strong incentive” to negotiate and refers to the Tribunal’s finding in its

2°? Claimant further refers to its

Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability in this regari
financial expert Mr. Pingle who testified that “[t]he involvement of the Development
Finance Institutions and the Export Credit Agencies ... facilitates resolutions of some of
the outstanding issues ... like the tax regime.”*® In Claimant’s view, the absence of a
Mineral Agreement on the valuation date would therefore not have been fatal to the

project.

Claimant rejects the argument that under rule 46(2) of the 2002 BM Rules, its right to
negotiate a mineral agreement would have expired three months after the issuance of the
Mining Lease. It argues that the three-month period starts only once the Mineral
Agreement is “present[ed] for signature,” regardless of when the Mining Lease is

issued.°°5

As for the fiscal terms of the Mineral Agreement that its expert Prof. Davis used in its
model, Claimant contends that these were the terms on which the Governments and TCC
would likely have agreed but for the Governments’ takeover and abandonment of
negotiations: (i) a 2% provincial royalty; (ii) EPZ status for the first 15 years followed by
the normal tax regime; (iii) extension of TCCP’s mining lease for the life of the mine;
and (iv) participation by Balochistan through a 25% Net Profit Interest. Claimant argues
that these terms are supported by the progress that the parties had already made in the

negotiations and the concessions granted to other projects in Balochistan.*°°

According to Claimant, the parties had already agreed in the negotiations that the mining
lease would be renewed for the life of the mine. Claimant refers to Balochistan’s proposal
to constrain its discretion under the 2002 BM Rules such that a second term “shall not be
unreasonably withheld.”**’ In Claimant’ s view, the GOB gave no indication that the first
term would be shorter than thirty years and that it would not extend the lease for the life
of the project “absent good reason,” thereby creating a presumption in favor of
renewal.*°* It claims that in subsequent face-to-face negotiations, Balochistan “went a
step further” and agreed to renew the mining lease for the life of the mine as confirmed
by contemporaneous correspondence and negotiation minutes as well as the witness

testimony of Ms. Boggs.*® In addition, Claimant refers to the GOB’s obligation under
the CHEJVA to provide “appropriate administrative support as required for the
obtaining all leases ... being necessary for the conduct of Joint Venture Activities” and
considers that a refusal to renew the Mining Lease would also have been contrary to the
GOB’s contractual obligations as well as to Claimant’s legitimate expectation that the
license would be renewed.*”? Claimant further submits that mining lease renewal is
common in the mining industry because a lack of security of tenure would disincentivize
the lease holder from making further investments and the bidding process for a new
operator can be time-consuming and costly — without any guarantee of finding a suitable
candidate willing to enter into an agreement more favorable to the Government.
According to Claimant, Governments therefore generally allow investors the option for
renewal.*”! Claimant further argues that it would have been “entirely reasonable” for
Balochistan to agree to the renewal “to ensure an uninterrupted flow of revenue to the

Province from the project.”>”

Claimant further considers it likely that the Reko Diq project would have received EPZ
status “or its functional equivalent,” at least during the “initial capital-intensive” years of
the project. Claimant emphasizes that each of the other mining projects in the region had
received EPZ status: the Tanjeel project proposed by Mincor Resources NL (““Mincor”)
in 2004; the Duddar and Saindak projects in 2001 and 2004, respectively (both extended
beyond their initial ten-year term); and Balochistan’s competing Reko Diq project.
Claimant rejects the argument that it abandoned its request for EPZ status in negotiations
and argues that it was willing to explore alternatives but continued to believe that it would
receive “certain of the benefits of an EPZ regime.”>"> According to Claimant, the final
package of concessions could have been “a custom suite of modifications to the normal

tax regime rather than an EPZ designation,” but maintains that the “combined tax
regime” assumed by Prof. Davis is “a reasonable approximation’ of the fiscal terms on
which the parties would likely have agreed.*”4 Claimant further argues that if Balochistan
had remained “a true partner to TCC,” it would have advocated for EPZ status because

it stood to gain from it, as Balochistan itself argued in its submissions before the

Balochistan High Court.*’> As for Pakistan, Claimant points out that the Federal
Government was interested in encouraging foreign direct investment in the extractive
industry as well as in improving relations with Balochistan. In addition, it would have
received significant tax revenues after the expiration of the EPZ term — according to Prof.
Davis’ calculations nearly 30% of the project’s cash flows. Furthermore, Claimant
considers that the EPZ regime was specifically intended for projects like the Reko Diq
project, which it considers to be “ideal candidate for EPZ status” as it “promised to
provide employment and a boost to Pakistan’s exports.”>7° Claimant also submits that
granting EPZ status would have been consistent with specific assurances it received from
the highest levels of the GOP.*””

381.

Finally, Claimant claims that the parties would most likely have agreed on a stabilization
of the provincial royalty at a rate of 2%. In Claimant’s view, Mr. Khokhar confirmed
during the Hearing on Quantum that while the royalty rate was raised to 5% in 2009, the
Duddar project continued to pay 2% because Balochistan was “getting something good”
in exchange.*’* According to Claimant, the offer it made to Balochistan in the
negotiations, i.e., to replace its equity interest under the CHEJVA by a Net Profit Interest
while capping the royalty at 2%, was “expressly modeled on the arrangement that existed
between Balochistan and Duddar,” and if Balochistan had been acting in good faith, it
would have agreed to this offer.*”” Claimant claims that, like its earlier sliding scale
proposal which was made before the parties turned to restructuring Balochistan’ interst,
its net profit interest (“NPI”) proposal was “a good deal for Balochistan” because the Net
Profit Interest would have increased its economic return, eliminated the financial risks
associated with its equity interest under the CHEJVA and provided it with advance
minimum payments from the outset of production. It further points out that Balochistan
could have rejected the proposal and opted not to participate in the project, thereby
receiving only an “enhanced royalty” of 5%, which would have diminished its revenue
from nearly USD 5 billion to less that USD 2.2 billion.*®° Claimant also notes that, like
all of its proposals, the NPI proposal was “up for negotiation” and in case some of its
terms were unacceptable to Balochistan, it could have requested adjustments. In

Claimant’s view, it is therefore reasonable to assume that Balochistan would either have
accepted the proposal or, “at the very least, responded to it with a reasonable counter-

proposal.”**!

In response to Respondent’s additional challenge to the manner in which Claimant has
calculated the royalty, Claimant refers to rule 102 of the 2002 BM Rules which provides
that royalty shall be charged on “the fair market value of any mineral” which is in turn
defined as “the sale price ... determined by reference to the first point at which [the
mineral] was disposed of [ina sale at arm’s length], without allowing for any deductions
from the gross amount so determined.”*** According to Claimant, this corresponds to the
net smelter return used as a basis by Prof. Davis, which is calculated as a percentage of
the price paid by the smelter at the Port of Gwadar which reflects the smelter’s
transportation costs but none of Claimant’ costs.*** Claimant also points to the definition
of “Sales Proceeds” in the drafts of the Mineral Agreement exchanged by both sides.°**

Claimant concludes that it is for the Tribunal to determine what the outcome of the
Mineral Agreement negotiations would have been and points to a series of sensitivity
analyses conducted by Prof. Davis that include alternative fiscal regimes and a non-
renewal of the Mining Lease.*8> Claimant maintains, however, that it would be
inconsistent with the Tribunal’s finding that the Mineral Agreement negotiations failed
as a direct consequence of Balochistan’s unlawful takeover decision if the Tribunal were
now to conclude that no agreement would have been reached.**°

In addition, Claimant argues that any uncertainty regarding the fiscal terms should be
resolved in favor of TCCA because it is due to the Government’s unlawful conduct and,
in addition, Respondent’s “procedural misconduct regarding these very issues, in
particular Pakistan’s deliberate defiance of the Tribunal’s disclosure orders” regarding
documents concerning the Saindak and Duddar mines. Claimant maintains its request for
appropriate adverse inferences and adds that, even without specifically drawing these
inferences, the Tribunal “should at the very least take into account Pakistan’s misconduct
and its thwarting of the evidentiary process when it evaluates the record and determines
what fiscal terms the parties would have agreed but for Pakistan’s and Balochistan’s

unlawful acts.”>*"

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal has not made any finding that Claimant had a
legitimate expectation to conclude a Mineral Agreement and argues that there was no
specific commitment to this effect nor were the Governments under a legal obligation to
conclude a Mineral Agreement. Respondent submits that rule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules
prohibited the parties from entering into a mineral agreement inconsistent with “any other
law” and argues that Claimant therefore could not expect to gain exemptions from legal
requirements such as permitting or approvals. In addition, Respondent claims that by
raising unreasonable demands, Claimant “undermined any ability to reach a deal on a

mineral agreement” and “created the problems it now bemoans.”***

Respondent further takes the position that “[g]iven the lengthy history or stalled
negotiations and distant positions, the most likely outcome would be that no mineral
agreement would have been agreed whatsoever.” It notes that a Mineral Agreement was
not necessary to operate a mine in Balochistan and submits that it was within the
discretion of both Governments, independently from one another, whether to grant certain
benefits in return for benefits to the State.°®° At the same time, Respondent contends that
the absence of a finding that a Mineral Agreement would have been concluded would
render the value of Claimant’s plan to mine Reko Diq speculative.*””

Respondent argues that at the relevant time, Claimant was aware of the risk that no
Mineral Agreement would be concluded and categorized the “Jnability to Negotiate
Mineral Agreement” as a “high risk” with a likelihood of 0.375 in the risk register of the
Feasibility Study, which would have resulted in “NO PROJECT.” According to
Respondent, this shows that the failure to obtain a Mineral Agreement would not only

have made the project less valuable but rather “could doom the entire project.”*?'

As for the terms put forward by Claimant, Respondent submits that: (i) Pakistan would
not have agreed to a royalty rate below the minimum of 5% required by law; (ii) Pakistan
never agreed to grant EPZ status and Claimant abandoned this request during
negotiations; (iii) the parties “were nowhere close to agreeing to the overall fiscal
regime”, and (iv) the Governments “roundly rejected’ a provision providing for an

automatic renewal of the 30-year mining lease.*””

In addition, Respondent submits that
the Governments focused on Claimant presenting a value addition in the form of
downstream processing facilities. According to Respondent, the terms of a Mineral
Agreement — if one had been concluded at all — would have been “far more favorable to

Pakistan.”>°

In this regard, Respondent emphasizes that the Governments were not willing to accept
whatever terms Claimant suggested but they “wanted a fair deal, and they were willing
to walk away from the table if TCC would not give it to them.” According to Respondent,
the Governments were also conscious of creating precedents for other investors that
would request similar exemptions or concessions if these were granted to Claimant.?**
Further, Respondent emphasizes that the differences between the parties arose already in

2008, i.e., before the alleged takeover decision taken by the GoB.*%>

Respondent submits that the 5% royalty rate was codified in June 2009 and Barrick
acknowledged in its annual report of 2009 that Claimant would have had to pay this rate
by law. In Respondent’s view, this shows that both Pakistan and Claimant expected that
it would have to pay the 5% rate.*°° Respondent submits that other companies were also
“assessed the 5% rate” and Claimant failed to show that Saindak paid any lower rate
while Respondent showed that it paid the 5% rate. Similarly, Respondent considers that
it provided information on the royalty rate paid by Duddar.*?’ Respondent also considers
it confirmed by Ms. Boggs’ testimony as well as contemporaneous meeting minutes that
no agreement had been reached on the application of a 2% royalty rate and that Claimant
never expected that it would pay less than the legal rate.*°* Respondent further maintains
that the Governments “were unwilling to accept anything below a 5% royalty” which,
according to Respondent, represented the floor rather than the ceiling of their position
because a higher royalty rate was necessary to “defuse political unrest and resistance to
the project in Balochistan.” In this regard, Respondent points to Mr. Lehri’s proposal in
October 2008 that the royalty rate increase from 5% during the first ten years to 5.5% for
the next ten years and ultimately 6% for the remainder of the project.*°? According to

Respondent, Claimant was aware at the time that there was no room for its NPI proposal
including a 2% royalty rate because it internally acnowledged a need “to refocus away
from the 25% and 2%.”*° Respondent also points to Ms. Boggs’ testimony that she
“assumed that we would probably end up with something between what we had originally
proposed, 2 percent, what they had proposed, 5 percent and a sliding scale” but maintains
that the offer of a sliding-scale royalty came from Claimant and was never accepted by
the Governments.*°! Respondent notes that according to Claimant’s contemporaneous
estimate, the difference between the 2% and 5% royalties amounts to USD 37.5 million
annually and, according to Respondent, thus to USD 2.1 billion over a 56-year life of the
mine.** In Respondent's view, these royalties were necessary for the GOB to receive any
money from the Reko Dig project within a reasonable timeframe, taking into account its
obligation to make a 25% contribution to the funds of the project under the CHEJVA as
a Participating Party and a lack of participation in the project’s future cash flows as a

Non-Participating Party.*°?

391.

In addition, Respondent contends that Claimant’s expert Prof. Davis wrongly calculated
the royalties by applying the royalty rate to revenues net of smelter charges. According
to Respondent, this contradicts rule 102(1) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that
royalties are to be calculated based on the mineral’s “fair market value” which is in turn
defined in rule 102(2) as the sale in an arms-length transaction, a price in the mineral
agreement or on the international market. Respondent rejects the argument that net
smelter return is consistent with “fair market value” and points to rule 102(4), which
provides that the calculation does not allow “for any deductions of the gross amount so
determined.” Respondent considers its understanding confirmed by the reports of its
taxation expert Dr. Haq as well as the Feasibility Study which refers to a “2% royalty on

gross revenues by the Government of Balochistan.”**

392. Respondent further rejects the argument that it would have benefitted from Claimant’s
NPI proposal and refers to “millions of dollars in revenue” that it would forfeit by granting
Claimant free surface rights as well as “unpredictable losses and risks that might attend
the extended commencement period that TCC would impose” and future losses from the
tax exemptions sought by Claimant. Also taking into account that Claimant was
requesting an extension of the mining lease for the life of the mine, free surface rights and

a 2% royalty rate, Respondent considers that there was “no basis for Pakistan to accept
the NPI Proposal.”*°> According to Respondent, the NPI proposal would have provided
the GOB with less revenues than the CHEVJA structure with a 5% royalty and, while
“eliminating some risk to the GoB, it would also require relinquishing further control
over Reko Dig as well as any dividends it would have received as a shareholder under

the Mining Venture.”*°

Respondent further submits that the GOP had informed Claimant early in the negotiations
that its request would not likely not be accepted by the relevant departments and stood
firm in its position not to agree to Claimant’s “unreasonable demands,” which would
have resulted in a loss of “millions of dollars” for Pakistan.*°’ Respondent contends that
when Claimant was advised that “the EPZ regime is no longer politically viable,” it
dropped its request and instead followed up with its “NPI” proposal.‘ Respondent refers
to the oral testimony of Mr. Khokhar according to whom they “convinced [TCC] to pay
the normal tax ... and they dropped the issue of EPZ’ and who did not recall discussing
any alternatives with TCC.*°° Respondent also notes that Claimant never filed an
application for EPZ status and argues that it failed to clarify “how its mythical EPZ zone
would work’ but rather assumed that it would receive “some general, undefined
concession” which makes the entire calculation uncertain and speculative. According to
Respondent, Claimant’s “mega-project” could not be compared to other projects such as
Saindak and Duddar which Respondent describes as “failing projects’ which were
supported in the aim to train locals within Balochistan and improve the relationship to
China as they were operated by China Metallurgical Group Corporation (“MCC”).4!°
Respondent adds that so far Pakistan had not accepted any of Claimant’s proposals
regarding the tax regime and argues that there is no evidence that Claimant expected to

succeed on EPZ or any other concrete tax benefits.*!!

In response to Claimant’s argument that 85% of the issues had already been agreed,
Respondent refers to Mr. Khokhar’s testimony that the remaining 15% were no less
important and that while some issues could be solved in the fall of 2008, “there were also
remaining certain terms which we could not resolve” which included the fiscal regime
and stability, royalty rate, stamp duty exemptions and amendments to the 2002 BM

Rules.*'? Respondent also points to the testimony of Ms. Boggs who confirmed that the
fiscal terms had not yet been agreed and that they were using the terms they had proposed
for the purposes of the Feasibility Study even though “those terms had not yet been agreed

by the Government.”4'3

395. Respondent further rejects the argument that the parties had agreed on a renewal of the
mining lease and claims that, instead, the parties had agreed that the matter was to be
decided independently by the Licensing Authority under the 2002 BM Rules. Respondent
notes that it repeatedly rejected Claimant’s request for an automatic renewal and
questions Ms. Boggs’ testimony that mining leases are commonly renewed in the
industry, noting that there is no such history in Pakistan and that other mining leases in
the area have much shorter terms and are subject to substantial changes upon renewal.*!*

In addition, Respondent considers it a “/eap of faith” to assume that the mine would have

been operational in thirty years and that Balochistan would have wanted to renew the

mining lease, given the “extraordinary shortcomings” in the Feasibility Study, the

“hazards of TCCA’s operations on the surrounding areas” and the history or its owners’

projects which included “some of the most prominent disasters and scandals in the

modern mining world.”*'>

396. Respondent also argues that, as a matter of law, a valuation should not assume renewal
of a lease when there is discretion on the part of the State and refers to various cases in
which the tribunals considered the extension “far too contingent, uncertain and

unproven” or that it was conditional upon the fulfillment of numerous substantive and

procedural steps.*!°

397. Finally, Respondent claims that in fact Claimant was the one abandoning the negotiations
when copper prices collapsed in October 2008 and failed to provide critical information
while engaging in dilatory tactics and submitting proposals which had already been
rejected.*!7 Respondent further claims that when the negotiations stalled in 2009,

Claimant “enacted the ‘Heavy Hand’ initiative to apply ‘Political Leverage’ and
‘unwanted federal pressure’ on GoB officials in order to push through its version of the
mineral agreement.”*'® Respondent notes that the Advocacy Review Briefing, which it
describes as “the founding documents of the Heavy Hand,” refers to a “strategy [for]
engaging ‘political’ wings vs. militant wings” and considers it confirmed that Claimant
intended to contact militants and make use of an adversarial conflict between Balochi
nationalists in order to compel the GOB to “capitulate to TCC’s demands.”*"? According
to Respondent, Claimant thereby not only acted contrary to its earlier undertaking that it
would “abstain from political activity whatsoever affecting the sovereignty or security of
Pakistan” but also beyond the exercise of political influence given that Claimant
considered approaching a known terrorist suspect.*?? Respondent also refers to
Claimant’s attempts to secure a meeting with Chief Minister Raisani which did not,
however, assist it in obtaining a Mineral Agreement because, as noted by Claimant’s
representative at the time, “his expectations are very high and the project may not be

robust enough to accommodate.”*!

Respondent further considers that the fiscal provisions included by Claimant in the
Feasibility Study “torpedoed months of negotiation efforts and goodwill” because the
Feasibility Study disregarded Respondent’s position by assuming EPZ status and a 2%
royalty rate and ignored the Governments’ proposal for value-addition up to the stage of
metal refining. Respondent refers to Mr. Khokhar who testified that after the Feasibility
Study had been submitted, “any chance of reaching an agreement on the remaining terms
of the mineral agreement diminished’ because “TCC had no respect for the decisions
made by the Parties through a mutually agreed process of negotiations and proceeded to
include the terms that most benefited itself”? Respondent also contends that Claimant
even used assumptions of concessions which it had already abandoned such as EPZ status

or did not expect to receive from the Governments such as the 2% royalty.*?*

Respondent asserts that a likely option was that Claimant would not have achieved a
Mineral Agreement. Respondent contends that Claimant abandoned negotiations and
refers to Mr. Khokhar’s testimony that Claimant’s CEO Mr. van Borries advised him in
October 2010 that Claimant was “no longer interested in a mineral agreement” but only

a mining lease.**4 According to Respondent, Claimant did not expect a Mineral

Agreement and “knew the effect would be catastrophic.”

Finally, Respondent contends that, contrary to Claimant’s argument and the Tribunal’s
finding, obtaining a mining lease would not have improved Claimant’s bargaining power
because the Government “had little to gain from changing the tax and royalty structure”
and Claimant had “the obligation to construct the mine and live up to the numbers in its
IMD FS.”*?° Respondent further refers to rule 46(2) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to
which an investor’s right to negotiate a mineral agreement expires three months after the
approval of the mining lease. Respondent rejects Claimant’s interpretation that the three-
month period starts to run only from the submission of a mineral agreement to the
provincial authorities and maintains that the provision aims to drive the company to begin
construction which does not require a mineral agreement and therefore does not permit
for any further delays. In Respondent’s view, the mining lease would therefore have
strengthened Pakistan’s position and Claimant failed to show that it would have been able
to reach agreement on the Mineral Agreement and obtain the relevant approvals within
“the dwindling time left to it.”4?”

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes that the Parties are in dispute as to: (i) whether a Mineral Agreement
would have been concluded at all; and, if so (ii) the commercial terms on which the parties
would have agreed. The Tribunal will address these two aspects in turn.

i. Whether the Parties Would Have Concluded a Mineral Agreement

At the outset of its analysis of whether Claimant has established that the Parties would
have concluded a Mineral Agreement at all, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed that a
Mineral Agreement was not a strictly necessary requirement for constructing and
operating the mine. However, as demonstrated, inter alia, by Claimant’s
contemporaneous evaluation in the Feasibility Study of the risk that no mineral agreement
would be concluded,*”* it was considered highly desirable and relevant to reach an
agreement on the commercial terms and in particular the fiscal regime that would apply
to the project. Consequently, the Tribunal also considers it common ground that the

question whether a Mineral Agreement would have been concluded or, from the
perspective of a willing buyer in November 2011, whether it was likely that a Mineral
Agreement would be concluded following the approval of TCCP’s Mining Lease
Application is relevant to determining the value of the project as of the valuation date.

The Tribunal recalls its finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that while
the Mineral Agreement negotiations “had apparently stalled before the Mining Lease
Application was filed, the parties may well have decided to revive them after the grant of
the mining lease, given that Claimant would then have been the only one allowed to
conduct mining operations in the area.” The Tribunal found that “[t]here would thus have
been a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues” and considered that
“Claimant would have been in a far better bargaining position as holder of the mining
lease over the area than it was before, in particular once it became clear that the
Governments considered that Claimant did not have a right to convert its exploration

license into a mining lease.”*”°

Respondent disputes this finding and refers to rule 46(2) of the 2002 BM Rules, which
provides:

“If the mineral Agreement in case of L.S.M and the lease deed in case of Small

Scale Mining is not executed within three months of the communication of the

approval of the application for a mining lease and the presentation of the

mineral agreement / lease deed for signature, the right of the applicant to

such lease shall be deemed to have lapsed unless the licensing authority is

satisfied that the delay in execution was not caused by the applicant or was

due to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control.”*°
In Respondent’s view, granting the mining lease would in fact have weakened Claimant’ s
position because its right to negotiate a mineral agreement would have expired three
months after receiving the mining lease. In the Tribunal’s view, this position is not
supported by the wording of the provision nor the economic intent of agreeing on a
mineral agreement. As pointed out by Claimant, rule 46(2) refers to a time period of three
months starting from “the communication of the approval of the application for a mining
lease and the presentation of the mineral agreement ... for signature.” In addition, the
provision refers to a lapse of “the right of the application to such lease,” i.e., the mining
lease, rather than a lapse of the right to negotiate a mineral agreement. The Tribunal is
therefore not convinced that rule 46, which bears the heading “Duration of mining lease,”
was intended to place a time limit on the negotiations of a mineral agreement. It rather
appears that the intention was to provide for a timeframe within which the Mineral
Agreement, once negotiated and presented for signature, would have to be executed.

concluded to address various matters relating to mineral operations as the Government or
the parties to the agreement may consider necessary. There is no indication that such a
mineral agreement would have to be negotiated and concluded before or shortly after the
mining lease is granted and that it would in turn not be possible to negotiate and conclude
a mineral agreement providing for certain terms regarding mineral operations at any point
thereafter.

Respondent further argues that the Governments would have little interest to make any
concessions regarding the tax and royalty structure and that Claimant would have been
under an obligation to realize the project regardless of any concessions to be made. In the
Tribunal’s view, this argument is detached from reality. Claimant and its owners as well
as possible third-party financing institutions would have had to commit large amounts of
money into the project and it is plausible that they would have done so only if they were
able to reach some form of agreement on the fiscal terms that would apply to the project
and thus to make a reasonably reliable projection regarding the future profitability of the
mine. In addition, the Governments would also have had an interest to provide the project
sponsors with some form of security or stability regarding the fiscal regime in order to
ensure that the project would be developed with all the monetary and non-monetary
benefits that this would bring to Balochistan and Pakistan.

The Tribunal wishes to emphasize that is not assuming that the Governments were under
a legal obligation to conclude a Mineral Agreement or that they did not have any
discretion as to the terms that they would negotiate with Claimant. However, as the
Tribunal already held in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and as it maintains in
this Award, it would have been in the mutual interest of the negotiating parties to reach
an agreement in order to ensure that the project would in fact be financed, constructed
and become operational.

Respondent points out that the negotiations had stalled before TCCP filed the Mining
Lease Application and claims that this was due to Claimant’s unreasonable demands and
its own delaying tactics when copper prices fell in 2008. It also claims that Claimant in
fact informed Respondent after it had submitted the Feasibility Study to the GOB that it
was no longer interested in a Mineral Agreement. As for the latter allegation, the Tribunal
notes that it is based exclusively on the witness testimony of Mr. Khokhar who testified
that he recalled that “in a meeting taking place in October 2010 in [his] office, Mr.
Gerhard von Borries, Chief Executive of TCC, stated, ‘we are no longer interested in a
mineral agreement, We are only interested in a mining lease. Forget the mineral

412.

agreement.’” Mr. Khokhar further stated that he understood this message to have been

conveyed to other Governments officials as well.**!

While it is true that Claimant did not present Mr. von Borries as a witness in these
proceedings, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Khokhar’s testimony is contradicted by the
contemporaneous record which shows that Claimant was still pursuing a Mineral
Agreement. As pointed out by Claimant, Mr. von Borries himself sent a letter to the Chief
Secretary, Mr. Lehri, on 4 October 2010 containing a revised offer regarding the Reko
Diq project, which included, inter alia, a term sheet for the Mineral Agreement “for
further discussion.”**? In addition, on 5 October 2010, the Chairman of Claimant’ s Board
of Directors wrote to Chief Minister Raisani where he also presented Claimant’s new
offer and explicitly stated that they “srust[ed] this letter now sets the stage for full
discussions and agreement on the proposed Project and Mineral Agreements, on which

this offer is contingent.

The Tribunal further notes that the negotiations had stalled already in 2009 and it is not
convinced that this was caused by Claimant not pursuing the negotiations or raising
demands that made any further negotiations pointless. As for the first point, the Tribunal
again considers Respondent’s allegation contradicted by the record which demonstrates
that Claimant was continuously making efforts to reach an agreement on the outstanding
negotiation items and was presenting various new proposals for the Governments to
consider. As to the second point, the Tribunal has not been provided with any indication
that the Government were considering further negotiations pointless at the time.

In this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of Claimant’s statement in its Post-Hearing
Brief that its primary objective was to reach stabilization of the fiscal regime and that,
once that was obtained, it was willing to “compromise on the specifics of the tax and
royalty in order to secure the stability it had been promised.”** In the Tribunal’s view,
this willingness to consider a compromise, which is confirmed by the contemporaneous
proposals and efforts made by Claimant towards the Governments, shows two things. On
the one hand, it was likely that the parties would have reached some form of agreement
on the fiscal terms that would apply to the project. On the other hand, Claimant would
likely not have insisted on each of the fiscal terms which it had proposed and which, in
the absence of any agreement by the time the Feasibility Study was delivered to the GOB,
it had also included as a basis for its evaluation of the project in the Feasibility Study and
the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. This second point will be addressed in more detail
below in determining the fiscal terms on which the parties would most likely have agreed.

414.

416.

2009, the Tribunal also recalls that the present assessment is based on a but-for scenario
in which Respondent had not breached its obligations under the Treaty. Respondent is
correct in pointing out that the Tribunal did not have to express an opinion in the Decision
on Jurisdiction and Liability as to whether the Governments’ conduct in the Mineral
Agreement negotiations in itself or together with other actions impugned by Claimant
amounted to a breach of Respondent’s Treaty obligations. However, the Tribunal did find
that the Licensing Authority denied TCCP’s Mining Lease Application because the GOB
had decided to develop its own mining project rather than to continue collaborating with
Claimant.*** The minutes of the GOB cabinet meeting on 24 December 2009 explicitly
state that the agenda item “Taking over of Rekodiqg Copper & Gold Project from TCCP.
by the Government of Balochistan” was approved in principle and that it was “further
decided not to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with
TCCP.”**© In the Tribunal’s view, this is a strong indication that the GOB’s decision to
take over the project was directly linked to the fact that there were no actual negotiations
after this cabinet meeting but only high-level meetings in which assurances were given
to Claimant which turned out to be false.*”

On that basis, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the Tribunal’s but-for assessment
must eliminate the fact that the GOB had decided not to go ahead with the Mineral
Agreement negotiations because it had decided to take over the project and develop its
own project instead. For the same reason, the high risk rating assigned by Claimant in the
Feasibility Study delivered in August 2010 to the risk that it would not be able to conclude
a Mineral Agreement with the GOB and GOP, which was based on the actual situation in
which negotiations had stalled due to the GOB’s decision not to go ahead with them,
cannot form the basis for the Tribunal’ s but-for assessment of the likeliness that a Mineral
Agreement would be concluded in the absence of Respondent’s Treaty breaches.

While the Tribunal does not wish to go as far as finding that a Mineral Agreement would
already have been concluded as of the valuation date, it maintains the view that if the
GOB had not decided to take over the project from Claimant, it would have continued to
negotiate with Claimant and an agreement would likely have been reached between the
negotiating parties, including the GOB, regarding the terms and in particular the fiscal
regime that would apply to the project.

In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that Claimant’s financing expert Mr. Pingle stated
in his expert report that fiscal stability agreements are rarely “pre-agreed,” i.e., concluded
before financing is secured for the project, but they are usually among the last items

agreed at the request and insistence of financing institutions willing to provide funds for
the project. He added that “[t]here is a point in almost every large project when the
foreign governmental institutions meet with the host government, without private parties
present. At that point, the foreign governmental institutions lay out their minimum
requirements for them to make their loans or investments. It makes a significant difference
to a host government when it realizes that massive FDI and a loan package worth billions

of US$ turn on its unwillingness to agree to standard documentation.”**

The Tribunal finds this statement convincing and considers that it supports its finding that
a Mineral Agreement providing in particular for fiscal stability would have been
concluded after the mining lease was granted to TCCP.

ii, The Commercial Terms on Which the Parties Would Likely Have
Agreed in the Mineral Agreement

As asecond step, the Tribunal will assess the commercial terms and in particular the fiscal
regime on which the parties would likely have agreed for the project in the Mineral
Agreement.

In this regard, the dispute between the Parties concerns four issues: (i) the royalty rate,
including the base for calculating the royalties; (ii) EPZ status or a “functional equivalent”
of tax concessions vs. normal tax regime; (iii) renewal of the mining lease after the first
30-year term; and (iv) participation of Balochistan through a 25% Net Profit Interest vs.
participation or non-participation as provided in the CHEJVA.

The Tribunal understands that Claimant’s offer in May 2009 to restructure the GOB’s
interest in the project as a net profit interest was made subject to certain conditions
regarding royalties and taxes as well as surface rights. In particular, Claimant’s offer at
the time was “available only with 2% royalty.”*® It further appears to the Tribunal that,
with all other fiscal terms being equal, a Net Profit Interest would undisputedly have been
more beneficial to the GOB than the initial 25% equity interest under the CHEJVA, in
particular during the first decade of mining operations.“? In the Tribunal’s view, it is
therefore appropriate to discuss the nature of the GOB’s interest not in isolation but
together with the question of the royalty rate on which the parties would likely have
agreed.

(a) The Royalty Rate and Claimant’s Net Profit Interest Offer

The first issue concerns the questions on which royalty rate the parties would have agreed.
While Claimant has instructed its expert Prof. Davis to assume a 2% royalty rate,

Respondent maintains that the GOB would not have accepted anything below the
statutory rate of 5%.

Claimant initially submitted that the amendment to the 2002 BM Rules of 17 July 2009
by which the statutory royalty rate was increased from 2% to 5% for both copper and gold
never came into effect and referred to its witness Ms. Boggs, who testified that there was
opposition to the increase from the local mining community and that they discovered that
the notification had never been gazetted.**! However, as pointed out by Respondent, Ms.
Boggs’ recollection is contradicted by Barrick’s annual report for 2009 which reported
for the Reko Diq project a royalty of “5% N[et] S[melter] R[eturn].”*#? Claimant did not
pursue this argument any further but focuses on the argument that other mining projects
in the region were not paying the statutory rate but had agreed with the GOB on lower
royalty rates. In particular, Claimant considers it confirmed by Mr. Khokhar’s testimony
at the Hearing on Quantum that the owner of the Duddar project continued to pay a 2%
royalty rate after the rate was raised in 2009 and further requests adverse inferences
regarding Respondent’s refusal to produce documents regarding the agreements reached
with the owners of the Duddar and Saindak projects.

While the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Mr. Khokhar’s oral testimony indicates that

the Duddar project may have continued to pay a 2% royalty’?

and that Respondent’s
decision not to produce the mineral agreement with Saindak despite the Tribunal’s orders
indicates that Saindak may also have paid less than the 5% statutory rate, the Tribunal is
not convinced that this in itself establishes that Claimant would also have agreed on a 2%
royalty with the GOB. It is undisputed between the Parties that the Reko Diq project was
not comparable to these projects in terms of size or profitability. According to Mr.
Khokhar, the Duddar project had been shelved because it was not economical and it was
then revived. He added that “[m]aybe Government have compensated ... to revive this
Project, make this Project economically healthy, the Government may have given certain
concessions.”*** According to Claimant’s own position, based on the sensitivity analyses
provided by Prof. Davis, the viability of the Reko Diq project did not depend on an
agreement on a 2% royalty rate and Claimant itself states that it was willing to consider a
compromise if it obtained the desired stability for the fiscal regime that would apply to
the project.

As Respondent pointed out, there is no indication in the record that the GOB had
expressed a willingness to accept a rate lower than 5%. As recorded in the meeting

minutes of the negotiation committee on 22 October 2008, Chief Secretary Lehri had even
proposed a rate increasing from 5 to 6% over the life of the mine.**> Ms. Boggs also
confirmed in her oral testimony that the parties had not agreed on the royalty rate to be
applied to the project.*“° She further testified that she “assumed that we would probably
end up with something between what we had originally proposed, 2 percent, what they
had proposed, 5 percent, and a sliding scale.”**" According to Ms. Boggs, the request for
a sliding scale had come from the Government, and she “thought we would arrive at
something that we would be able to tie to the various economic periods of the Project so
that increases in the Royalty wouldn’t affect the viability of the Project.”*** In those
circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced by the evidence in the record that the parties
would have agreed on a royalty rate of 2%.

While Respondent denies that the proposal for a sliding scale came from the Government,
the meeting minutes of 20 November 2008 show that Chief Secretary Lehri had
understood that a royalty rate increasing over the life of the mine could make economic
sense. In addition, the Tribunal notes that as of May 2009, Claimant was combining its
request for a 2% royalty rate with an offer to restructure the GOB’s interest as a net profit
interest, which would be more beneficial to the GOB than its equity interest under the
CHEJVA particularly in the first decade of mining operations.*”? In the Tribunal’s view,
this does not suffice as evidence that the GOB would have agreed on the 2% royalty rate.
However, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that in return for an arrangement
under which the GOB would not have been required to make any equity contributions
and would have received guaranteed annual minimal payments during the initial payback
period,*°° the GOB would have agreed to a lower royalty rate during this period. At the
same time, the GOB may well have maintained its request for a higher royalty rate in
subsequent years and the Tribunal therefore considers it likely that the parties would have
agreed on a sliding scale.

As testified by Ms. Boggs and confirmed by the contemporaneous documents, Claimant
proposed in October 2008 that the royalty rate would start at 2.5% for the first decade,
increase to 3% for the second decade and not exceed 4% for the time thereafter.**! Ms.
Boggs also testified that they “never received confirmation from Balochistan that this
scale was acceptable.”*°* To the contrary, pursuant to the record note prepared by the

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources of the GOP on the October 2008
negotiations, “[t]he GOB team showed reservation towards the proposal floated by the
TCC team.”**? However, this offer was made before Claimant proposed to restructure the
GOB’s interest in the project as a net profit interest. For the reasons set out above, the
Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that if taken together, the proposal of a sliding
scale increasing from 2% to 4% over the life of the mine and the net profit interest
proposal would have been acceptable to the GOB.

According to the sensitivity analysis provided by Prof. Davis, the impact of assuming a
time-varying royalty as proposed by Claimant in October 2008 while retaining the net
profit interest proposal results in a reduction of the value of Claimant’s share in the project
of USD 287 million.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent disputed Prof. Davis’ calculation of royalties
which is based on the net smelter return. Respondent relies on rule 102 of the 2002 BM
Rules, which provides in relevant part:
“(1) Subject to this Part, royalty shall be charged on the fair market value
of any mineral specified in Part I of the Third Schedule ... at the rate
specified in Part II ... or at such other rate as may be notified by the
Government from time to time in the Official Gazette.
(2) For the purposes of sub-rule (1), the fair market value of a mineral or
group of minerals is —

(a) where the mineral or group of minerals is disposed of in a sale at
arm’s length, the sale price;

(4) For the purposes of this Rule, the fair market value, in respect of any
mineral or group of minerals which has been disposed of, shall be
determined by reference to the first point at which it was disposed of,
without allowing for any deductions from the gross amount so
determined.”**>

Claimant takes the position that the net smelter return is consistent with the fair market
value royalty calculation under rule 102 and explains that net smelter return corresponds
to the sale price paid by the smelter to Claimant, which reflects the costs incurred by the
smelter for transportation from the port to the smelter but none of Claimant’s costs.
Respondent does not dispute that Prof. Davis has applied the sale price paid by the smelter
but relies on its taxation expert Dr. Haq who takes the view that “NSR does not reflect

“fair market value’ as defined under the BM Rules, since NSR includes certain deductions

to account for ‘costs incurred by the smelter’ (i.e. buyer).’”*4°°

In the Tribunal’s view, Prof. Davis has correctly used the sale price paid by the smelter
to Claimant as the base for calculating royalties. As stated in Barrick’s annual report for
2009 on which Respondent relies in the context of the royalty rate, “[t]he primary type of
royalty is a net smelter return (NSR) royalty. Under this type of royalty we pay the holder
an amount calculated as the royalty percentage multiplied by the value of gold production
at market gold prices less third-party smelting, refining and transportation costs.” For
Reko Dig, the report records “5% NSR.”*>’ The definition in Barrick’s annual report
confirms Claimant’s explanation that the term “net” does not mean that any costs incurred
by the mining company are actually deducted from the market price but rather that it
refers to costs incurred by a third party for smelting, refining and transporting the
concentrate. These third-party costs are naturally reflected in the sale price paid by that
third party to the mining company. In the Tribunal’s view, this type of royalty is consistent
with rule 102 of the 2002 BM Rules, which defines “fair market value” primarily based
on the sale price in an arms-length transaction which reflects the costs incurred by the
buyer in that transaction. In particular, rule 102(4), which does not allow for any
deductions from the gross amount, refers to the fair market value determined at the first
point at which the concentrate was disposed of and, thus, to the (gross) sale price that a
third party pays to the mining company.

Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that Prof. Davis has correctly applied the royalty
rate to the net smelter return, i.e., the sale price that Claimant would have received from
the smelter at Port Gwadar.

(b) EPZ Status or a “Functional Equivalent” of Tax Concessions vs. the
Normal Tax Regime

The second point in dispute between the Parties concerns the question whether the Reko
Diq project would have received EPZ status or a “functional equivalent” of tax
concessions for the first fifteen years followed by the normal tax regime for the remainder
of the life of the mine, as alleged by Claimant, or whether it would have been subject to
the normal tax regime from the start of operations, as alleged by Respondent.

It is undisputed that Respondent was not under a legal obligation to grant EPZ status, i.e.,
declare the area to an “export processing zone,” or similar tax concessions to the Reko
Digq project. Claimant rather argues that EPZ status was specifically intended for projects
such as Reko Dig, “which promised to provide employment and a boost to Pakistan’s

458

exports, and claims that all other substantial mining projects in the region had also

been granted EPZ status.

Respondent, on the other hand, points out that Claimant itself noted in a letter to Mr.
Khokhar dated 29 January 2009 that “the EPZ regime is no longer politically viable"?
and considers that Claimant thereby dropped its request for EPZ status. However, as
Claimant points out, it stated in the same sentence of that letter that they were advised by
the Negotiating Committee that “certain benefits of an EPZ regime would be available to
us under the normal tax regime, such as import tax and duty exemptions.”*® In addition,
the net profit interest proposal made by Claimant in May 2009 was also made conditional
upon receiving exemptions from stamp duties, local taxes as well as sales taxes.*°!

The Tribunal notes that Claimant’s position is that while it would not necessarily have
succeeded in obtaining EPZ status for the Reko Dig project, it is reasonable to assume
that it would have received a “functional equivalent, at least during the initial capital-
intensive years of the project.”** Claimant further argues that “[w]hile it is conceivable
that the final package of concessions agreed between the parties would have been a
custom suite of modifications to the normal tax regime rather than an EPZ designation,
the ‘combined tax regime’—fifteen years of the EPZ regime followed by the normal tax
regime for the remaining decades of the mine’s life—is a reasonable approximation of

the applicable fiscal terms for purposes of assessing TCCA’s damages.”*°?

The Tribunal considers that, when taking into account that Claimant’s initial Tanjeel
project at Reko Dig, the Saindak project, the Duddar project and the GOB’s own Reko
Diq project had received EPZ status, which was destined for the type of investment that
Claimant intended to bring to Pakistan, it is reasonable to assume that Claimant’s Reko
Diq project would either also have been granted EPZ status or would have received
similar tax concessions from the Government during the first years in which the large
amount of capital investments had to be made.

The Tribunal finds further support for this finding in the fact that the GOB was a partner
in the project and would have received, under the net profit interest proposal, 25% of the
project’s net profits after the payback of investment (until that time, it would have
received annual minimum payments).*°* Consequently, the GOB, which was moreover
required under the CHEJVA to provide administrative support and perform all reasonable

acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture,*°
would have had a strong interest to obtain EPZ status or (equivalent tax concessions) for
the Reko Digq project. That this was in fact the case before the GOB decided to take over
the Reko Diq project for itself, is confirmed by the GOB’s submission before the
Balochistan High Court in 2007 in which it argued that “[t]he fact that the Reko Dig area
has been declared as an Export Processing Zone (‘EPZ’) is beneficial to the Province of

Balochistan and will increase its potential to make more money from the project.”*°°

In the Tribunal’s view, the GOB’s support for obtaining EPZ status or equivalent tax
concessions would also have been in line with the Tribunal’s finding in the Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability that the assurances provided to Claimant and its owners by
officials at various levels of both Governments contributed to the legitimate expectation
that both Governments would support and facilitate Claimant’s investment.4*” According
to the testimony of Claimant’s witnesses Mr. Luksic and Ms. Boggs in the liability phase
of these proceedings, which remained undisputed by Respondent, these assurances also
referred to tax benefits that the project would obtain from the Governments in return for
their investment in the country. Mr. Luksic specifically testified in his first witness
statement that in a meeting with Prime Minister Aziz in January 2006, i.e., shortly before
Antofagasta acquired shares in Claimant, the Prime Minister “recommended that TCC
seek an EPZ (‘Export Processing Zone’) for the Project.” Mr. Luksic further referred to
a meeting with President Musharraf in April 2006 in which “the President also assured
as of the Government’s support for obtaining an EPZ status for the Project and for
concluding a Mineral Agreement.”* The Pakistani press reported on both of these
meetings and the assurances provided by the Prime Minister and the President to
Claimant’s future owners on these occasions.*?

Finally, the Tribunal notes that Claimant has not instructed Prof. Davis to assume that
EPZ status would be granted for the life of the mine but rather only for the first fifteen
years of the project and that the project would then be subject to the normal tax regime
thereafter. As demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis performed by Prof. Davis on this
point, granting EPZ status for the first fifteen years of the project would still have
provided the Federal State with 29.6% of the project’s total cash flows (compared to
42.6% if no EPZ status were granted). At the same time, the additional profits that would
have gone to Claimant and the GOB would also have benefitted the GOB, increasing its

share of the profits from 22.4% under the normal tax regime to 26.1% under EPZ status
(i.e., on Claimant’s calculation, a difference of USD 740 million).*”°

440. The Tribunal therefore concludes that it was likely that the GOP would have granted EPZ
status or similar tax concessions to the Reko Dig project for the first fifteen years of the
project, as it has been assumed by Prof. Davis.

(c) Renewal of the Mining Lease for the Life of the Mine

441. Finally, the Tribunal will address the dispute between the Parties as to whether the
Mineral Agreement would have included a provision pursuant to which the mining lease,
which would have been granted for an initial term of 30 years, would have been renewed
for the life of the mine.

442. As pointed out by Respondent, rules 46(1) and 50(3) of the 2002 BM Rules provide as
follows:

“46. Duration of mining lease. (1) Subject to these rules, a mining lease shall
be valid for an initial term of mining lease shall not be less than ten years and
shall not exceed thirty years but the lease may contain a clause permitting
renewals at the discretion of the licensing authority or Government for
further period not exceeding thirty years at a time on such terms and in such
form as may be in force on the day on which the renewal is sanctioned.

50. Application for renewal of mining lease. ...
(3) [O]n application duly made, the lease may be renewed in accordance with
Rule 48(1)(b) with or without a variation of the conditions of the lease.”*"

443. Respondent further points to the testimony of Mr. Khokhar, who testified that “[t]he issue
of granting or renewing mining leases was not a focus of the negotiations as this matter
was to be decided independently by the Licensing Authority as per provisions of the BM
Rules.” Mr. Khohkar further stated while the issue was not within the competence of the
GOP, he “expressly recall[ed] telling TCC during the negotiations that they should not
expect anything automatic, but should follow our laws and procedures in Pakistan.” Mr.
Khokhar further referred to the Governments’ counterproposal for a Mineral Agreement
dated 7 August 2008 which in his view “disagreed with TCC’s proposal to secure an
automatic mining lease and restored the primacy of the BM Rules” and “shows that the
issue of whether or not TCC would obtain a mining lease was, in our view, not a valid

topic of discussion during the negotiations.”*”"

444. The Governments’ counterproposal referred to by Mr. Khokhar indeed did not accept the

44 Exhibit CE-226, cla

provision proposed by Claimant in its initial draft of 9 July 2007, which had provided,
inter alia, that a Mining Lease “shall ... (ii) be for a period of 30 (thirty) years; and (iii)
be renewable for a further period of 30 (thirty) years at the request of the holder thereof,
but otherwise such Mining Lease shall be on the terms and conditions set out in the
BMR.’*” The Governments’ draft instead provided that the Mining Lease “shall ... (ii)
be for a period not exceeding 30 (thirty) years; and (iii) be renewable for a further period
according to Article 86 BMR at the request of the holder thereof, but otherwise such
Mining Lease shall be on the terms and conditions set out in the BMR approval of which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.”*"*

In the Tribunal’s view, the Governments’ draft confirms Mr. Khokhar’s testimony that
the GOB did not accept at that time that the Mining Lease should be renewed without any
qualification merely “at the request of the holder” but instead introduced a reference to
the provision in the 2002 BM Rules on the duration and renewal of the mining lease. On
the other hand, the GOB proposed to add that the approval of the renewal “shall not be
unreasonably withheld.” In the Tribunal’s view, this proposal does not accord with Mr.
Khokhar’s testimony that the question of renewal was “not a valid topic of discussion”
but instead indicates that the GOB was willing to provide some form of assurance to
Claimant that the mining lease would be renewed if there was no valid ground for refusing
to do so.

In this regard, the Tribunal also recalls that the GOB was required under clause 7.2(a) the
CHEJVA to provide “appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining
of all leases, licenses, claims, permits or other authorities of any kind whatsoever being
necessary for the conduct of the Joint Venture Activities.”*” Clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3
further provided that “[t]he Parties shall be just and faithful to one another and will not
do or omit to be done anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture contemplated
herein as a whole are prejudiced” and that “[e]ach Party shall execute all necessary
additional documents and do all such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect
to the purposes of this Agreement.”*”° In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the
Tribunal held that “[p]ursuant to these provisions, the GOB was under an obligation to

 

se 14.2.1 (ii) and (iii). As rule 86 contains provisions regarding the duration and renewal

 

of a mining lease but is part of Part IV “Special Provisions Relating to Small Scale Mining” and it is otherwise
undisputed between the Parties that the Reko Diq project would be subject to the regular provisions in Part III
“Mineral Titles and Mineral Concessions,” the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that this reference was
made by mistake and not specifically intended to deviate from the provisions on duration and renewal of mining
leases under rules 46 and 50 quoted above.

provide administrative support in procuring the required licenses and permits and to
perform all reasonable acts to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests
of the Joint Venture as a whole, i.e., to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral
resources at Reko Dig.”*”"

447. The Tribunal does not wish to go as far as Claimant’s suggestion that a refusal to renew
the mining lease would in any circumstances have “prejudiced” the interests of the Joint
Venture and therefore have been contrary to the GOB’s obligations under the CHEJVA.
However, the Tribunal does agree that the GOB’s contractual obligations are relevant in
determining whether it is reasonable to assume that a willing buyer in this but-for
assessment would have factored in the expectation that the mining lease would be
renewed.

448. Claimant takes the position that the GOB had in fact already agreed in the negotiations
that the mining lease would be renewed for the life of the mine. It relies on a letter sent
by Ms. Boggs to Chief Secretary Lehri in on 10 August 2009 in which she explained the
benefits as well as the conditions of the net profit interest proposal Claimant had made in
May 2009 and summarized the points on which they had agreed with the Steering
Committee, including, “that Mining lease will be extended for the life of the mine on same
terms and conditions.”*”* Ms. Boggs further testified in this regard that while the initial
draft had provided for discretion of the Government, “it was clear from subsequent
negotiations that this was not, indeed, a major point of contention and that Balochistan
was willing to agree to renew the license.”*”? She added:

“Balochistan’s willingness to agree to extend the mining lease term was
unsurprising. If the project was successful, as we expected it would be, and if
we determined, at the end of the initial thirty-year term that we wanted to
continue mining, it would be in Balochistan’s interest to renew our license to
ensure an uninterrupted flow of revenue to the Province from the project. The
Government also had good reason to provide us with security of tenure for
the entire life of mine. Our intention was to be at Reko Dig for a long time—
long beyond the initial mine development. We planned to make a series of
expansions, including the one described in our Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study, and we also planned to do further exploration within our mining lease
area. We had already identified several additional targets that we wanted to
explore and I remember that Tim Livesey and his team were itching to do
more drilling. Because drilling is expensive, we stopped drilling once we had
sufficient resources to support the initial mine development feasibility study
but we expected to resume after the mine was operational. By agreeing to
extend the mining lease for the life of the mine, the Government was signaling

to us that we would have security of tenure over any deposits we discovered
through additional exploration. Because the Government stood to gain from
the exploitation of these additional deposits, it was in their interest to ensure
we had every incentive to continue drilling.”**°

449. Mr. Khokhar, on the other hand, maintained in his testimony that “the mining lease

renewal was not a focus of the negotiations, because it was an issue to be decided by the
Licensing Autority independently under the BMR 2002” but at the same time that he
explained to Claimant that “they should not expect automatic renewal and that any

renewal would need to follow the existing laws and procedures.”**!

The Tribunal notes that there appears to be common ground between the Parties’
witnesses to the extent that the issue of mining lease renewal did not form one of the
major points of contention during the negotiations, but they fundamentally disagree as to
the conclusion or agreement reached by the parties on that point. In the Tribunal’s view,
it is not plausible to assume that Claimant accepted without any major discussion that the
matter would be entirely within the discretion of the Licensing Authority, without any
form of assurance that Claimant would be entitled to continue operating the mine after
the initial 30-year term.

Ms. Boggs’ summary in her letter to Chief Secretary Lehri in August 2009 of the points
on which the parties had reached agreement indicates the contrary and Respondent did
not point to any contemporaneous evidence in the record that the GOB disagreed with
that summary. Claimant further pointed to the minutes of the Negotiation Committee
meeting on 15 October 2008 according to which “TCC has requested in regards to
assurances as to its mining title and access” and Mr. Roberts and Mr. Chaudry, who are
referred to as participants from Pakistan’s side with Mr, Chaudry being the Chairman of
the Negotiating Committee, “do not think this is a problem and these rights should be

incorporated into the overall agreement.”4**

Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal considers it likely that the GOB would
have agreed on a provision in the Mineral Agreement pursuant to which the Mining Lease
would be renewed after its initial 30-year term. As pointed out by Ms. Boggs, it would
also have been in the interest of the GOB that the mine would continue to operate without
interruption and provide it with revenues from its 25% interest in the project and the
royalties it would be collecting. Likewise, it would have been in the GOB’s interest to
provide Claimant with security in return for Claimant’s continued commitment to further
develop and expand the mine as exploration activities continued in parallel to the

construction and operation of the initial mine. In this regard, the Tribunal also takes note

of Ms. Boggs’ further testimony:
“Even in the absence of an explicit written agreement from Balochistan to
renew our lease, however, I believe we would have been able to secure a lease
renewal. In my experience, governments always renew mining leases unless
there has been a major rift in their relationship with the investor, such as an
environmental disaster or serious mismanagement. If a project is going well,
it is clearly in the government’s interest to renew the lease. With some very
few exceptions, governments, particularly those without a long history of
domestic mining, do not have the capacity to run large mines like this one and
they therefore have no choice but to partner with a major mining company
and there are just not that many of them. The bidding process to find a new
partner is time-consuming and potentially very costly and there is no
guarantee that the government will be able to reach an agreement that is
more favorable than the one they already have in place with the original
investor.”4

While the Tribunal considers this testimony plausible and therefore agrees with Claimant
that it is reasonable to assume in the present but-for assessment that the GOB would have
agreed to renewing the Mining Lease after its initial 30-year term, the Tribunal is not
entirely convinced that the GOB would have agreed to a completely unconditional
renewal, i.e., a renewal without retaining any possibility to re-negotiate any of the terms
to account for, e.g., a change of circumstances.

In any event, the Tribunal considers it plausible that a willing buyer valuing the project
in November 2011 would have factored in a certain risk that the GOB might not agree to
a completely unconditional renewal and/or that the Mining Lease might not be renewed,
or at least not on the exact same terms, thirty years into the future. For that reason, the
Tribunal finds that the valuation of Claimant’s investment in this arbitation may not
simply assume that the Mining Lease would be renewed, without making any deductions
for an inherent risk that the renewal of the Lease by the provincial Government might not
be forthcoming as originally planned.

In this regard, the Tribunal also agrees with Respondent that, contrary to Claimant’s
suggestion in its Quantum Memorial which it did not pursue further in its subsequent

submissions,***

the Tribunal did not make a finding that Respondent had created a
legitimate expectation on Claimant’s part that it would be entitled to a renewal of the
Mining Lease for the life of the mine without any changes to the commercial terms that
would apply to the project for 56 years into the future. In particular, the Tribunal does not

agree with Claimant’s argument that a finding made by the tribunal in CME v. Czech

Republic that the “possibility of non-renewal of the [broadcasting] license ... must be

disregarded as a matter of fact” because “generally, broadcasting licenses in Europe are

renewed as a matter of ordinary administrative practice’”**°

would be transferrable to the

present case. It is undisputed between the Parties that the Reko Diq project would have

been the first mining project of this scale in Pakistan. Consequently, there can be no

general practice in Pakistan to renew a mining lease for a project such as Reko Diq “as a

matter of ordinary administrative practice.

456. As noted above, Ms. Boggs’ testimony that mining leases are commonly renewed in the

industry because most governments do not have the capacity to run large mines and

because they have no guarantee of finding an alternative operator with whom they would

be able to reach a more favorable agreement is perfectly plausible. In the Tribunal’s view,

this does not eliminate, however, the risk that the Government might request an

adjustment of the commercial terms in return for renewing the Mining Lease or might

even refuse to renew the Mining Lease based on certain legitimate policy considerations

that could not be known in November 2011. In the Tribunal’s view, it further cannot be

assumed that any request for re-negotiations or the refusal to renew, regardless of the

reasons for such refusal, would necessarily have to be deemed a breach of Respondent’s

obligations under the Treaty that must be assumed away for the purposes of this but-for

assessment.

457. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that: (i) a willing buyer would have included the value

associated with a mining lease renewal in its valuation because it was likely that the GOB

would have agreed on such a provision in the Mineral Agreement; but (ii) the buyer would

also have factored in the risk that the GOB might not have agreed on an unconditional

renewal or that, in any event, the mining lease might not be renewed or at least not be

renewed on the same terms thirty years into the future. In the Tribunal’s view, this finding,

i.e., that a buyer would have accounted for the value but would also have accounted for

the risk that this value might not materialize, is also supported by the significant value

that Claimant’s expert Prof. Davis calculated for the renewal.

458. According to the sensitivity analysis provided by Prof. Davis, the impact of an assumption

that the Mining Lease would not be renewed would lower the value of Claimant’s share

in the project by USD 2.978 million.**° For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal

considers it most likely that a willing buyer would have factored in a risk of 25% that the

value of the renewal would not materialize or that the renewal would not be on the same

commercial terms and thus would have been prepared to pay 75% of that value, which

therefore represents the fair market value of the renewal for the present but-for

assessment. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the amount requested by Claimant
must be reduced by 25% of the difference between the value including the renewal and
the value excluding the renewal, i.e., by USD 744.5 million.

(d) Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that it is most likely that Claimant and the Governments
would have reached an agreement on the terms of a Mineral Agreement. It further finds
that those terms would most likely have included: (i) a sliding scale increasing from 2%
to 4% over the life of the mine, on the basis that the GOB’s interest in the project would
have been restructured to a 25% net profit interest; (ii) EPZ status or similar tax
concessions for the first fifteen years of the project while returning to the normal tax
regime for the remainder of the mine’s life; and (iii) a provision regarding the renewal of
the Mining Lease. As for the renewal, the Tribunal finds, however, that a willing buyer
would have factored in the risk that the value of the renewal would not materialize or that
the renewal would not be on the same commercial terms and would thus have been
prepared to pay 75% of the value associated with a renewal of the Mining Lease.

On that basis and based on the sensitivity analyses provided by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal
concludes that the amount requested by Claimant as damages must be reduced by: (i)
USD 287 million to account for the assumption that the parties would not have agreed on
a 2% royalty but rather a sliding scale of royalties increasing from 2.5% to 4% over the
life of the mine; and (ii) USD 744.5 million to account for the assumption that a buyer
would have factored in a risk of 25% that the Mining Lease might not be renewed or
might not be renewed on the same terms.*87

Whether Claimant Has Established the Estimation and Classification of the
Resources Reported in the Feasibility Study

Second, the Tribunal will address the question whether Claimant has established the
accuracy of the estimation and classification of the resources that were reported in the
Feasibility Study and also formed the basis of Prof. Davis’ calculation of the project’s
future cash flows.

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that TCC conducted multiple drilling campaigns extending over
350,000 meters and thereby established that Reko Diq had proven and probable reserves
(the reserve base reflecting measured and indicated resources) of nearly 13 million tonnes
of copper and nearly 23 million ounces of gold, which as of 2011 made it the sixteenth

largest copper deposit in the world.‘** Claimant adds than an additional 1,759,309,557
ore tonnes of inferred resources had been identified but were not assigned any value by
Prof. Davis even though a willing buyer would have expected to be able to mine a
significant portion of those inferred resources during the life of the mine.**?

Claimant argues that neither of Respondent’s criticisms on geology and metallurgy
affects the value of the project because they are factually incorrect and “reveal a profound
lack of understanding about mining practices in general and the Reko Dig project in

particular.”4°

Claimant maintains that its resource estimate is “highly reliable” and refers to its geology
expert, Mr. Mario Rossi, who concluded that TCC’s resource estimate “was conducted
professionally and in accordance with widely accepted industry practices. It provides a
reliable estimate of Reko Diq’s resources, an estimate of the kind that buyers and sellers
regularly use when transacting in mining properties.”*°' Claimant considers that neither
Respondent nor its experts have challenged the result of Mr. Rossi’s “targeted due
diligence specifically for this arbitration” which “independently corroborated TCC’s
work” and notes that Respondent’s experts have not offered any alternative resource
estimate. In Claimant’s view, Respondent’s case on geology does not concern resource
estimation but only the classification of those resources and TCC’s compliance with

reporting standards.‘

Claimant contends that the classification of Reko Diq’s resources into the relevant levels
of geological confidence, i.e., measured, indicated and inferred resources, followed sound
industry practice and was done “[w]ith no incentive other than getting it right.” Claimant
submits that its owners had initially adopted different methods, with Barrick applying the
geometric method reflecting the current industry standard and Antofagasta applying the
less common and more complex probabilistic method; they then called on Mr. Rossi to
propose a common methodology for TCC. Mr Rossi advised them to adopt “a rigorous
version of the tried-and-tested geometric method, using a separate probabilistic check”
which improved on the model that had been used by Barrick and implemented a
probabilistic view of the classification so obtained, in line with the most advanced
industry standards.?? Claimant further points out that this methodology was also
endorsed in a contemporaneous independent audit by the consultant Behre Dolbear,
which noted that “[t]he Rossi scheme, moving from probabilistic to geometric methods,

has enforced a focus on continuity in grade and geology. The precepts and steps to be

implemented are endorsed.”**

466. In response to the argument of Respondent’s expert, Prof. Dagdelen, that Mr. Rossi’s
method led to a result that “is 41.5% higher than the Measured and Indicated tonnes
estimated by Antofagasta’s geologists,” Claimant notes that he failed to take into account
Antofagasta’s results yielded by the probabilistic method under an expansion scenario,
which were in fact higher than the results yielded by Mr. Rossi’s method used in the
Feasibility Study.*?> Claimant also points out that the results were lower than those
produced by Barrick’s initial classification of measured and indicated resources.*”°

467. Claimant further rejects the argument that Mr. Rossi’s method would be “highly unusual
and unprecedented,” noting that Prof. Dagdelen agreed with Mr. Rossi that the geometric
method is the leading classification method used by about 95% of the industry and
conceded that “probably zero” mining companies follow the probabilistic technique.*””
Claimant points out that Prof. Dagdelen did not identify any reason why TCC should have
adopted a probabilistic method but merely referred to “the advantages that Mario [Rossi]
came up with.”*°8 Claimant notes that Mr. Rossi also described risks and shortcomings of
this method which makes it less robust than the geometric method but suitable as a
check.*”? According to Claimant, Prof. Dagdelen does not have the relevant professional
expertise on resource estimation because, unlike Mr. Rossi, he has not worked as a
Qualified Person (QP) on any of the world’s 10 largest copper mines and could not
identify any copper porphyry deposit on which he worked as a QP.**”

468. Claimant also contends that, even though considering it “strictly irrelevant to Reko Diq’s
market value” whether formal reporting requirements were met, TCC and its owners
complied with the applicable reporting standards. While the Canadian reporting standard
NI 43-101 does not apply to the private Australian company TCC, Claimant argues that
in any event it contains language in its Section 5.3 pursuant to which producing issuers,
such as Barrick and Antofagasta, are exempted from the requirement than an independent
QP approve technical reports (not the feasibility study itself, which usually remains

which were instead reviewed and signed off by QPs employed by both companies.*°!

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

Respondent submits that in order to determine the value of the copper and gold beneath
the surface at Reko Diq, Claimant must achieve a level of certainty that it would be able
and economically feasible to turn the rock into recoverable metal. Respondent emphasizes
that if any of the issues that might arise poses a cost that is too high for the mineral to be
economically extracted, the resources cannot be classified as anything more than inferred

and do not have any economic value; they can never become reserves.°°?

Respondent agrees with Claimant regarding the classification of resources into inferred,
indicated and measured resources and adds that inferred resources, which cannot be
ascribed any value, can only be moved to a category of increased certainty based on
studies evaluating all relevant factors if these studies show that “at the time of reporting,
that extraction of the metals from the deposit can be economically justified.”*"* According
to Respondent, Claimant made “unwarranted assumptions that moved resources into
more valuable categories” and while it may have been able to measure the total size of
the ore bodies, “it did not have the drilling to show that it could classify the resources as
indicated or measured on the scale claimed by TCC.”>

Respondent notes that Claimant’s owners initially performed independent analyses of
Claimant’s drilling, which reached “far different conclusion{s].” According to
Respondent, the model applied by Antofagasta based on statistical assumptions is a
“newer model” but “tends to produce more accurate results” than the “block model”
applied by Barrick; it resulted on a “much more conservative figures with a lower

economic value.” According to Respondent, the third-party consultant hired by the
owners, Mr. Rossi, “essentially selected the best parts of both methodologies, even though
the methodologies depart from different premises, and decided to move a large portion
of the inferred resources into the indicated category and add more resources to the

inferred category.” Respondent considers that there is not scientific support for this
505

 

method and its conclusion is not sufficient for NI 43-101 regulations

Respondent submits that Claimant’s claims must fail because it has failed to maintain the
information underlying the database to create the resource model or method to interpret
it and because Mr. Rossi’s classification of the resources “lacks significant indicia of

reliability.” In addition, Respondent considers that there is no dispute regarding the
amount of metallurgical sampling in testing and maintains that the deposits are not
sufficiently certain “to merit the scant sampling and testing done.” In Respondent’s view,
Claimant’s “excuses” regarding the lack of a signature by a QP further show that a buyer
would not have trusted in a feasibility study that Claimant’s owners would not stand
behind.* According to Respondent. “the entirety of the resource model and its

calculations are uncertain and speculative.”>””

Respondent argues that since 2006 the size and grade of the resource at Reko Diq have
deteriorated “[w]ith almost every update.” According to Respondent, Claimant’s drilling
campaign revealed “a low-grade copper deposit that continued the drop in quality.”
Respondent also points out that the audit conducted by Behre Dolbear in September 2009
mentions a reduced size of the resource.°°*

According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to show that its resource model is
trustworthy given that: (i) it has not provided an independent analysis that admitted flaws
were fixed; (ii) it did not rebut Prof. Dagdelen’s findings regarding the flaws in the
database underlying the resource model; and (iii) Mr. Rossi’s method and its application
are “completely unreliable.”>®

Respondent claims that Prof. Dagdelen identified “several key flaws in the drill hole
database” for Tanjeel, H-13 and also the Feasibility Study, such as “grade-related issues”
and “information gaps” in the alterations and lithologies as well as collar coordinates.>!°
According to Respondent, the audit referred to by Claimant in response to this criticism
does not address any corrective measures for Tanjeel and H-13.>'! Respondent also refers
to Prof. Dagdelen’s review of the project records in Islamabad which in its view revealed

missing information and made it impossible to confirm or recreate data.>!?

Respondent further contends that it is doubtful whether Claimant used the method devised
by Mr. Rossi, given that he was not aware whether it was applied, there was no QP making
a decision regarding the appropriate classification method, and Claimant’s final resource
calculation was “far better” than the results predicted by Mr. Rossi.>!? In addition,
Respondent argues that the results yielded by his method are unreliable because “none of

the key conclusions in his memorandum proved true.” Respondent considers it irrelevant
whether the method produces identical results at 110,000 tonnes and 220,000 tonnes of
production per day and maintains that it is “highly unusual” that the resource calculations
of Antofagasta and Barrick were so far apart. According to Respondent, the fact that Mr.
Rossi’s method yielded results “roughly similar to Barrick’s resource calculation” shows

that Barrick was “controlling the process and pushing for unscientic conclusions.”>\*

Respondent submits that, unlike Mr. Rossi who was recruited to review his own work in
the past, Prof. Dagdelen, is “a QP with no prior interest in the project’ and he has
identified several criticisms of Mr. Rossi’s method which was never adopted by an
independent QP.*'>

Respondent submits that by contrast to the Feasibility Study which Claimant kept
confidential, a feasibility study compliant with with NI 43-101 regulations is made
available to the public person and signed by a QP.°'© Respondent maintains that
Claimant’s Feasibility Study had to be signed by an independent QP, in compliance with
the relevant reporting standard NI 43-101, arguing that the statement of resources came
from a joint venture where one partner is not a “producing issuer’ for purposes of
Canadian law. Respondent also argues that Barrick has filed technical reports signed by
a QP for every resource calculation since 2009; however, there was no resource
calculation done at feasibility level which would have included all available information.
Respondent claims that Claimant failed to show that its Board of Directors or either of its

owner had “signed off’ on the Feasibility Study.>!”

Respondent contends that the audit conducted by Behre Dolbear was done at pre-
feasibility stage and “does not look at the resource model in the IMD FS from the
perspective of the heightened accuracy requirements” at feasibility level.*'* Respondent
also points to statements in the audit that data from an additional 63 drill holes had to be
integrated “before the figures can be accepted for input to feasibility studies” and “other
deposits also need to be re-estimated over the coming months.”>!° Respondent notes that
Mr. Rossi does not make reference to adding data from these additional drill holes or re-
estimation of other deposits and therefore concludes that Claimant “did not do the work

to take its resource estimation from the pre-feasibility stage to the feasibility stage.”>”°

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

At the outset of its analysis on whether Claimant has established the accuracy of the
estimation and classification of the mineral resources reported in the Feasibility Study,
the Tribunal notes that the estimation and classification performed for the Feasibility
Study was not conducted for the purposes of a damages valuation in contentious
proceedings but rather for the purposes of determining whether the resources available
could form the basis of successful mining operations at Reko Dig. As a general matter,
the Tribunal therefore does not consider it plausible that Claimant and its owners would
apply a “haphazard resource estimation technique to inflate the value of the mine,” as
Respondent alleges.*?! Why would these companies and their employees as well as the
independent consultant they instructed to devise a method for estimating and classifying
resources be interested in “inflating” the value of a mine that they intended to build and
operate? In the Tribunal’s view, these general considerations should be borne in mind
when evaluating the criticisms raised by Respondent and its experts in these arbitration
proceedings.

As a further preliminary matter, the Tribunal understands that a distinction must be drawn
between: (i) “resource estimation” which aims at determining the tonnage and grade
(concentration) of metal in a deposit; and (ii) “resource classification” which describes
the level of confidence in the predicted resources, with the commonly used categories
being measured resources (high level of confidence), indicated (reasonable level of
confidence) and inferred resources (low level of confidence).*?? While the Parties take
different views as to whether inferred resources can be attributed some economic value,
Prof. Davis has not attributed any value to the inferred resources for Reko Diq in his

523

valuation,°~’ which means that there is no need to express an opinion on this point.

While Respondent initially argued that Claimant applied “improper resource estimation
techniques” in the Feasibility Study,*** Respondent clarified in its subsequent
submissions that its objection relates to the “resource model” devised by Mr. Rossi and
whether it was (correctly) applied in the Feasibility Study.*?> As explained by Mr. Rossi
in his expert report, this model did not concern the estimation of the resource available at
Reko Diq but rather its classification into the categories of confidence.*”° It therefore
appears that Respondent’s challenge does not aim at the resource estimate as such or how

it was obtained. The Tribunal is aware that this may not be entirely correct as Respondent
has challenged Claimant’s approach to determining the geo-metallurgical domains of the
ore body which are also relevant in the estimation of the overall available resource.>”’
However, as the Parties have addressed this issue in the context of the question whether
Claimant has conducted adequate metallurgical sampling and testing to determine the
economical extractability of the metals, the Tribunal will also analyze this aspect in that
context. For the present purposes, it suffices to note that, as will be set out in detail below,
the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant’s approach to determining the geo-metallurgical
domains was sound and in accordance with industry practice.

At the same time, Respondent’s challenge to the classification of the resources is relevant
to the present analysis of Claimant’s damages because, as Prof. Davis explained, only the
two categories reflecting a high or reasonable level of confidence, i.e., measured and
indicated resources, are taken into account in his valuation. Consequently, the Tribunal
must be convinced that the classification of the resources in the Feasibility Study was
reasonable and in line with what a willing buyer would have accepted in November 2011.

It is undisputed between the Parties that Barrick and Antofagasta initially applied
different methods to classify the resources at Reko Dig and that these methods produced
deviating results. In a Memorandum dated March 2009, Mr. Rossi of GeoSystems
International (GSI), who was consulted by Claimant to determine the best approach to
classifying the resources, noted that the different resource classification methods applied
by Barrick and Antofagasta “have resulted in very different proportions and tonnages of
measured, indicated and inferred material for these deposits,” which he depicted in the

following table:***

485. Mr. Rossi noted that Antofagasta’s method depended on the production rate, which he

considered “difficult to reconcile with mining engineer’s standard practices” and “better
suited for advanced projects, when the production rate is not variable.”>? Following a
description of the geometric method applied by Barrick and the probabilistic method
applied by Antofagasta, Mr. Rossi considered:

“Both hods have ad\ and disad and both hods (as are

all resource classification methods) are inescapably subjective. Although

well understood by most people, the reader is reminded that we should not

believe there is an ‘objective’ or ‘true’ classification method; the best we can

aspire for is reasonableness and consistency.”>°

Mr. Rossi discussed the advantages and disadvantages of probabilistic and geometric
methods and examined the results of sensitivity analyses conducted on each method and
then proposed an alternative method:
“GSI proposes a method based on a combination of geological and grade
continuity, data density, and understanding of the deposit. The method is in
essence an attempt to gain the advantages of the two concepts originally
proposed by the JV partners. It is geometric in the definition of the resource
categories, but with a probabilistic check to assess whether the original
definitions of measured, indicated, and inferred result in an acceptable level
of confidence.

Most of these steps were completed in Santiago, with the exception of the final
smoothing and the probabilistic characterization of the classified resources
(see below). Also, [Antofagasta] stated that there were further drill holes that
could be added into the database (not currently available) which should be
considered before the final classification runs were completed.”**!

Mr. Rossi then presented a step-by-step plan of his proposed method and concluded that
“Talfter completion of the initial resource classification using the proposed method, it is
expected that total resources for H14 and H15 will be split approximately evenly into
Measured, Indicated, and Inferred.” He further expected that the total measured plus
indicated resources would drop from 2.37 billion tonnes to about 2 billion.**?

Respondent argues that it is uncertain whether the method proposed by Mr. Rossi in
March 2009 was implemented by Claimant, given that the results produced by its method
were higher than those predicted by Mr. Rossi in the conclusions of his memorandum.
During the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Rossi testified that he did not know at the time
whether Claimant would follow his recommendation but that based on a due diligence

that he was asked to perform for this arbitration, he stated that “7 know that they followed
the recommendations in the main points that I made, and I know that they also made
modifications to the parameters I had originally proposed, which I found appropriate
during my due diligence last year.” He added that “these [modifications] were minor in
the context and actually affected only the Measure for some grade domains.>* In
response to the question whether his expectation that the measured and indicated
resources would drop to 2 billion tonnes corresponds to the actual results reported in the
Feasibility Study, Mr. Rossi acknowledged that this was not the case. He added that
“remember that this was an exercise based on a different model that had not yet been
prepared” and emphasized that there had also been a “significant number of tonnage in
the unclassified category” and clarified that his expectation of a drop in resources had

referred to an expected reclassification of resources.>**

The Tribunal considers Mr. Rossi’s testimony credible. Based on his due diligence of the
resource classification work for the Feasibility Study, Mr. Rossi confirmed that Claimant
had implemented the method he had proposed with certain minor modifications that he
considered appropriate. The Tribunal does not have any reason to believe that, contrary
to Mr. Rossi’s testimony, Claimant significantly deviated from the recommendations
given by Mr. Rossi in March 2009. Neither of Respondent’s experts has testified to this
effect. In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that certain of Mr. Rossi’s expectations did not
materialize does not indicate that Claimant did not follow his proposed method; neither
does it indicate that Mr. Rossi’s method is generally unreliable, as Respondent also
alleges. As Mr. Rossi testified, the model he was proposing had not yet been prepared
and he was therefore only providing expectations. His expectations were further based on
the data available as of March 2009, i.e., more than a year before the Feasibility Study
was completed. It is undisputed that during this time period, Claimant continued its
drilling program and continued to receive updated data that would then be incorporated
into the resource classification model. Mr. Rossi noted already in his March 2009
memorandum that Antofagasta had stated that “there were further drill holes that could
be added into the database (not currently available) which should be considered before
the final classification runs were completed.”>*>

Consequently, the Tribunal considers that the remaining issue to be addressed is whether
the resource classification method devised by Mr. Rossi, as implemented by Claimant in
the Feasibility Study, produced accurate results on which a willing buyer would have
based its valuation of the Reko Diq project. In this regard, the Tribunal takes note of the

following statement in Mr. Rossi’s expert report regarding the choice of a method for

classifying resources:
“There is no single right answer, and the appropriate method must be decided
by the CP. International standards, which I discuss in more detail below, give
significant leeway to the CP to make these decisions and do not prescribe
rigid criteria or precise implementation methods to be used at the time of
resource classification. A common misconception is that resource
classification provides an objective measure of the confidence with which a
mineral resource estimate has been obtained. In fact, resource classification
is simply the expression of an experienced and competent opinion, that of the
CP. The CP’s good judgment is crucial. For this reason, the JORC Code (and
other, similar standards) stipulate that ‘[a] ‘Competent Person’ must have a
minimum of five years’ experience which is relevant to the style of
mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity
which that person is undertaking.””>*°

Mr. Rossi emphasized in his report that he was never asked to act as a Competent Person
(CP) for Claimant or any of its owners but that he was rather asked to advise their own
CPs on what would be the most reasonable approach for the classification of the resources
at Reko Dig.°*” According to Respondent, the absence of a resource estimation at
feasibility level signed by an independent QP/CP, who exercised the “good judgment”
referred to by Mr. Rossi, means that Claimant’s classification of resources lacks the
necessary validation and is therefore unreliable.

The Parties are in dispute as to whether the Canadian reporting standards NI 43-101 on
which Respondent relies with regard to the requirement of an independent QP signing off
on technical reports applies to the resource estimate included in the Feasibility Study and,
if so, whether an exemption applies to the independence requirement because Claimant’s
owners are producing issuers. In the Tribunal’s view, however, the decisive question is
whether, as decribed by Mr. Rossi in the excerpt quoted above, “an experienced and
competent opinion” was given and “good judgment” was exercised by a person with the

 

necessary experience to determine the appropriate resource classification method for

Reko Dig.

The Tribunal understands Mr. Rossi’s testimony to mean that he was not the one making
the judgment call that he described above. Barrick’s and Antofagasta’s teams had the
necessary experience themselves but given the debate among them regarding the
appropriate classification method, they sought advice from a third party and decided to
act on that advice with certain minor modifications. As pointed out by Claimant, Barrick’s
and Antofagasta’s annual reports for 2011 reported on Reko Diq’s resource estimate and

included references to their respective QP/CPs.*** This was also noted by Prof. Davis in
his second report.>*?

494. Against this background, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that a
Competent Person from each of Claimant’s owners made the judgment call referred to by
Mr. Rossi and reached the conclusion that the method devised by Mr. Rossi was
appropriate for Reko Diq.

495. The Tribunal further notes that as part of his due diligence conducted for this arbitration,
Mr. Rossi also applied an alternative method, defining alternative geological domains and
applying different statistical parameters to estimate grades, to estimate and classify the
resources at Reko Diq and concluded that this method confirmed the reliability of
Claimant’s resource estimation, including the classification as measured and indicated
resources. Specifically, his alternative method resulted in an estimate of measured and
indicated resources that was roughly 0.8% higher than Claimant’s estimate. In his
opinion, both methods are “scientifically sound and could be adopted by a CP to estimate
Reko Digq’s resources” and he explained that close estimates yielded by the two alternative

methods confirm that the underlying data is sufficient and accurate.**?

496. Claimant also points out that the method proposed by Mr. Rossi in March 2009 formed
part of an audit by the mining industry consultant Behre Dolbear in September 2009 on
which both Parties relied in various parts of their submissions. On resource classification,
the audit report notes:

“The Rossi scheme, moving from probabilistic to geometric methods, has

enforced a focus on continuity in grade and geology. The precepts and steps
to be implemented are endorsed.”>*'

 

497. Respondent points out that the audit was conducted in September 2009 and therefore did
not pertain to the final resource estimate included in the Feasibility Study in 2010. The
Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that the audit does not confirm the correct
implementation of Mr. Rossi’s proposed method by Claimant in the Feasibility Study. It

confirms, however, that the auditor endorsed the method as such and contradicts

Respondent's allegation that the method was “haphazard” or “scientifically bogus.”>”

498. In addition, the Tribunal considers it noteworthy that while Prof. Dagdelen has criticized
the method proposed by Mr. Rossi, he has not specified which classification method
should have been applied nor has he provided an alternative resource estimate or
classification. The Tribunal is also not convinced by Prof. Dagdelen’s opinion that Mr.
Rossi’s method was “highly unusual and unprecedented” because a resource
classification method cannot be “somehow modified or amalgamated with other
methods.”>*3 Mr. Rossi clarified in his report that he did not amalgamate the two methods
but rather proposed to apply a geometric method and then perform a separate probabilistic
check to test the robustness of the initial geometric classification.**+ Prof. Dagdelen did
not dispute or address this explanation in his second report.

499. During the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Dagdelen confirmed that he considered it
“unusual” to have a probabilistic check on a geometric method and that he had not seen
this being done in his experience. He stated that “95 percent of the companies use
geometric method, and probably not many of them—probably zero—follow it by the
probabilistic technique.” Prof. Dagdelen first confirmed Mr. Rossi’s testimony that 95%
of companies use the geometric method rather than probabilistic methods but then
testified that Claimant should have used the probabilistic method because he considered
Antofagasta “a very experienced copper mining company” and one should “pay
attention” to the method proposed by its geologist.*4>

500. Based on Prof. Dagdelen’s oral testimony, the Tribunal considers it agreed between the
Parties’ experts that a geometric method as Mr. Rossi proposed to use as a primary
classification method is commonly used in the mining industry and would therefore also
have been considered sound and in line with industry practice by a buyer. The Tribunal
is further not convinced by Prof. Dagdelen’s suggestion that it would be less reasonable
to perform an additional, probabilistic check on the result obtained by the primary
classification method. In particular taking into account that Prof. Dagdelen agreed that it
was important to give consideration to Antofagasta’s probabilistic approach given its
experience in copper mining, the Tribunal fails to see how a probabilistic check validating
the geometric approach should render the classification less reliable than an isolated
geometric approach or an isolated probabilistic approach.

S01.

On that basis, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has established that the estimation
and classification of the resources reported in the Feasibility Study, which formed the

basis for Prof. Davis’ valuation of Claimant’s damage, is in accordance with industry
practice and corresponded to an exercise of “good judgment” by the relevant Competent
Persons within Barrick and Antofagasta who adopted and implemented the method,
which Mr. Rossi had proposed upon his review of the methods previously applied by
Claimant’s two owners in March 2009.

Whether Claimant Has Established That Sufficient Metallurgical Testing Was
Conducted to Confirm That the Minerals Could Be Economically Extracted

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that: (i) its metallurgical sampling adequately represented the material
to be processed by the mine; and (ii) its metallurgical testing validated “consistently high
recoveries of copper and gold at marketable concentrate grades.” Claimant refers to its
metallurgy expert, Dr. Corby Anderson, who confirmed that “the Reko Dig Feasibility
Study is robust. The underlying methodology and metallurgical testing are of excellent
quality. TCC conducted many phases of metallurgical testwork on many tonnes of Reko
Diq material originating from thousands of samples, which are representative of the

orebody’s relevant lithologies and alterations, or as we called them, ‘domains.’”>4°

Claimant acknowledges that initial tests using water from Reko Diq produced lower
recoveries but emphasizes that “[a]s a result of the poor site water result, anew program
of site water test optimization was implemented” which identified an improved flotation
process.**” Claimant argues that by using an improved chemical recipe, it was able to
obtain consistently high recoveries above 90% for all ore types found at Reko Dig,
including the tests using water from the Fan Sediments; these recoveries were confirmed
by subsequent pilot tests validating the proposed technology.*4* Claimant notes that
Respondent’s expert Prof. Dagdelen acknowledged that “AMMTEC was able to come up
with a flotation process that gave high copper and gold recoveries” and adds that Prof.
Dagdelen stated during Hearing on Quantum that “if a OP had signed [TCC’s studies],
then [he] would be totally happy with [them].”**° Dr. Anderson in turn testified that, being
a QP with relevant experience himself, he would have signed off on the studies “without
hesitation.”>*° Claimant also points to the confirmation by Respondent’s expert Prof.

Spiller that Claimant’s optimized reagent scheme produced “very, very good results.”>>!

505.

506.

much too small to provide meaningful data and the tests conducted on them by RDi
laboratory failed to account for numerous variables such as mineralogy and liberation or
likely oxidation, as Dr. Anderson pointed out in his report.*°? In any event, Claimant
claims that the results of the RDi laboratory confirmed the quality of the AMMTEC
results; according to Dr. Anderson, they “tend to corroborate that TCC’s proposed
flotation flowsheet was robust and adequately de-risked the project.”* Claimant also
points to Prof. Spiller’s report which noted that AMMTEC’s tests “produced a slightly
higher Cu recovery (90.5 vs 87.2) while with respect to Cleaner 2 concentrate Cu grade
the average was virtually the same (22.3 vs 22.8).”°>+

Claimant further rejects the argument that “TCC built its entire design criteria for the
mine around 21 tests from shallow depths with the highest grades.”>>> Claimant
emphasizes that its metallurgical program was not limited to 21 tests but rather consisted
of several phases of testing in which roughly 85,000kg of materials and 120,000kg of
water were used and contends that “thousands of metallurgical tests” were run, including
“hundreds of tests just to optimize and perfect Reko Dig’ ultimate metallurgical
flowsheet.”*© Claimant points out that Prof. Spiller admitted during the Hearing on
Quantum that “AMMTEC did many, many, many tests” and stated that “there [were] 21
tests that, you know, followed a vast amount of locked-cycle tets, open-cycle tests,

mineralogy, very, very in-depth looking at it.”°°7

Claimant argues that Respondent’s emphasis on AMMTEC’s interim report of March
2009 is misplaced because “a large and critically important portion” of Claimant’s work
had not been done at that time and Dr. Anderson confirmed that TCC’s studies and design
criteria were informed by “the whole body of work from May 2007 up until December
2009.”>** Claimant submits that Prof. Spiller admitted that he had not considered any tests
conducted during the feasibility stage, which included TCC’s pilot plant tests conducted
on 25 tonnes of material, and notes that he failed to list AMMTEC’s final report among
the documents he had reviewed.>*?

507. Claimant also notes that the re-logging of geological samples to which Respondent has

508.

pointed occurred in the summer of 2008 and, in addition to not being uncommon once the
understanding of the project’s geology improves, concerned only phase | test work which
was “entirely superseded” by phase 2 test work which had been already performed on the
basis of the new logging codes. As noted in the Feasibility Study, “[d]uwe to the amount of
recategorization in Phase 1, this second phase of sampling and test work was designed
to provide a complete and sound basis for the PFS.>°

Claimant rejects the argument that its metallurgical sampling was insufficient because
most of the samples tested for metallurgical response came from depths of 450 meters or

less from the surface.°°' According to Claimant, its metallurgical sampling was

representative of the deposit’s geo-metallurgical domains and thus the pit as a whole.*
Claimant considers it agreed between the Parties’ experts that domains “reflect the
classification of the deposit’s material into different units which, based on their mineral
composition and other relevant characteristics, are expected to respond in the same way
to metallurgical processes.”*® It further refers to Mr. Rossi who testified that “[b]efore
you send the first sample to the metallurgical test lab, you have an understanding of what
the geology is because you have all this other drilling that you have done. And it’s that
drilling that is actually defining the domains.” Again referring to Mr. Rossi, Claimant
submits that based on the previous drilling campaigns, it “had adequately characterized
the orebody from a metallurgical standpoint,” which allowed the metallurgical sampling

program to “target those domains.”>>

Claimant notes that, in total, its work comprised the drilling of 1,020 holes, extending
over 350,000 meters, which provided it with a high density of data and allowed it to
identify the relevant domains for metallurgical testing and target its specific metallurgical
drilling campaign. While material from earlier drilling also provided it with test samples
for metallurgical testing, Claimant also drilled specific metallurgical holes carrying down
“well below 450m” given that one domain had been identified that existed only deep
within the orebody. Claimant quotes from Mr. Richard H. Sillitoe, an expert on porphyry

deposits who reviewed the project’s geological data in June 2009 and confirmed that “no
further deep drilling is necessary and none need to be contemplated.”

Claimant points out that two of the main litholigies in Reko Diq’s domains are horizontal
layers of rock one of which (VIN) occurs at above roughly 350 meters from the surface
while the other (VFL) occurs below this depth. By contrast, the third main lithology (PFB,
porphyries) consists of vertical intrusions which are over 1,000 meters in depth. Claimant
submits that, as acknowledged by Prof. Dagdelen, it sampled VFL material from the
bottom of the pit.*® As for the vertical PFB domain, Claimant argues that it could select
samples from any depth because these would show, “within accepted levels of variance,

similar metallurgical response.” Claimant refers to Mr. Rossi who testified that “[i]n

larger porphyry systems like Reko Dig, a few hundred meters in vertical depth within the

porphyry formation will not substantially change the rock’s metallurgical properties.”>°

Claimant adds that the classification of the PFB domain was confirmed by “numerous
variability tests” testing material from different depths and emphasizes that neither Prof.
Dagdelen nor Prof. Spiller challenged Claimant’s definition of Reko Diq’s domains.
Claimant submits that: (i) Prof. Dagdelen confirmed during the Hearing that he did not
perform any variability tests to support his assertion that the domains showed
“variability’;>® and (ii) Prof. Spiller also admitted that he did not do any statistical test
of variance or variability to support his initial assertion that AMMTEC’s tests showed

“internal variability.”>”

Claimant also rejects Prof. Dagdelen’s assertion that it did not collect sufficient samples
from below 250 meters and refers to examples of what it considers misleading testimony:
(i) Prof. Dagdelen referred to a particular cross-section while omitting that in the
immediately adjacent cross-sections TCC drilled to the lower depths; and (ii) Prof.
Dagdelen had to admit that a sample of the very cross-section (RD-118) he referred to
was taken from below 350 meters and shipped to AMMTEC for metallurgical testing.>”!
Claimant also refers to Mr. Rossi who confirmed that “drill holes were carried down at

full density to the bottom of the ultimate pit.”>”

513. Claimant further argues that even if it had focused on the “top half’ of the mine as

514.

S15.

Respondent phrased it, this would have been “perfectly acceptable and consistent with
industry practice” given that this “top half’ of the cone shaped pit in fact corresponds to
85% of the rock that Claimant was planning to mine and mining at below 450 meters
would only have started for H-14 and H-15 at the earliest in year 13 - with mining at
Tanjeel and H-13 not going below 450 meters at all.°”* According to Claimant, investors
typically do not require metallurgical sampling of ore that will be mined that long after
the payback period which would have been 7 to 8 years in the present case.>”4 Claimant
submits that metallurgical test work is an interative process and would have continued in
the mining stage so that, as Mr. Livesey testified, “it did not make sense for us to be
concerned at this early stage with material below 450 meters that was only going to be
mined two and a half decades later.”>’> Claimant considers the soundness of prioritizing
the earlier years of production, in particular those of the payback period, in a metallurgical
program confirmed by Prof. Spiller’s admission regarding his work as QP on other
projects that “you prioritize in your intensity of focus the stuff that is going to be mined
during the payback period.”>”®

Claimant further maintains that it also performed tests on material below the cut-off
grade. In any event, Claimant considers it acknowledged by Prof. Dagdelen that the
bottom of the pits in fact contains relatively higher grade ore and a focus on shallower
parts of the deposits would therefore, if anything, have underestimated head grades.°””

Finally, Claimant rejects the assertion that it failed to establish the required recoveries for
an expansion to Tanjeel and emphasizes that phase 4 of its metallurgical program on
which the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study reports, was focused on optimizing the
flotation process for ore from Tanjeel which was to be blended with the ore from H-14
and H-15.>78 Claimant further submits that it sent approximately 7,000kg of H-13 samples

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

516. Respondent submits that for metallurgical testing, a mining company has to drill holes
“at a depth and frequency to sample the entirety of the proposed mine” because the
metallurgical samples must “fully represent the ore body.” In addition, Respondent refers
to the method and analysis of the testing done on the samples from the metallurgical
drilling holes which are important for determining the cost of production and identifying

the type of processing required for extracting the copper or gold.**°

517. Respondent maintains that Claimant has not “completely sampled and tested the deposits
from a metallurgical perspective,” as the deposit is variable and not sufficiently consistent
to rely on the “limited sampling and testing” conducted by Claimant.**! According to
Respondent, Claimant did not sufficiently test the deposit at depths below 450 meters and
in its last set of tests, i.e., the only tests to generate higher, more consistent results, it even
focused on material largely coming from the top 250 meters of the ore body and material
with “the best grades” in the ore body.** Specifically with regard to samples from lower
depths to which Claimant pointed Prof. Dagdelen during the Hearing on Quantum,
Respondent claims that Claimant had not tested these samples, even though it had failed
to establish that the domains were sufficiently consistent.°**

Sl

*

Respondent claims that Claimant took only 20 metallurgical samples, all from above 400
meters, for the pilot plant test of its Feasibility Study and refers to Prof. Dagdelen who
concluded that “without any pilot plant work involving material that will be mined below
the 400 meter depth when a significant amount of material is mined in the feasibility study
mine plans from 400 meters to 780 meters depths, this feasibility study is metallurgically

very uncertain and unreliable.”>**

519. Respondent also asserts that Claimant sent only 3 out of 9 rock types it had identified for
testing to AMMTEC and argues that even those results showed that recoveries “dropped
dramatically” when using water from Panangaz, a water source south of Reko Diq, and
“were uneven and experienced a range of results” when using water from the Fan
Sediments. According to Respondent, these were “crucial errors” showing that Claimant
had not done the work to find out how the rock would respond in its contemplated

scenario.**5

520. In addition, Respondent contends that Claimant “compromised the vast majority of the
samples, rendering them (and their results) useless” because it wrongly categorized the
lithology of the samples and sent them under the wrong label for testing. Respondent
refers to Prof. Dagdelen who stated that Claimant incorrectly blended the materials to
characterize the ore type, like flour and sugar instead of flour and salt. According to
Respondent, this affected almost 60% of the samples from the scoping study and pre-

feasibility study.**°

521. Respondent contends that Claimant and Mr. Rossi base their conclusion regarding the
alleged consistency of the entire ore body on 16 metallurgical tests (excluding 5 ore-type
tests done around the same time). According to Respondent, however, Claimant’s
metallurgy expert Dr. Anderson rejected this conclusion and testified that he would need

to see more.>*”

522. Respondent claims that Reko Diq was a project with “skinny” economics which allowed
only for a small margin of error. In Respondent’s view, Claimant’s testing program did
not come to understand this margin of error because it used composites blended from rock

of different depths which could not reveal potential variability.>**

523. Respondent further contends that the mine plan used in the Feasibility Study including
the flotation process that Claimant planned to apply was based on only 21 tests, 60% of
which come from the upper 250 meters of depth, and did not include the pilot plant tests
or mineralogy tests. In addition, Respondent argues that even if the 14 mineralogy tests
are added to the 21 tests, a total of 35 samples, none of which was at cut-off grade, is
“plainly insufficient” and it is an “absurd proposition” that these tests would accurately
reflect the entire deposit.**° In any event, Respondent claims that even these tests showed
that material from deeper depths provided lower recoveries.°””

524. Finally, Respondent refers to Prof. Spiller’s explanation that the composites used in the
pilot plant tests do “not represent what the plant will see in any given day and may
encompass years of production” and considers it confirmed by Dr. Anderson’s testimony
that a composite spanning over ten years of production could produce results of a
significant variance.**! Respondent criticizes that Claimant did not do “point tests” testing

a specific, limited portion of a given domain and that it changed the process within the

last set of tests conducted, with the results varying with each of the changes.°°?

525. Respondent concludes that Claimant’s metallurgical testing program was insufficient to
prove consistency and considers that “the reasonable position is to assume metallurgical

varability,” as a buyer would have done in light of the lack of testing for the deposits.**

526. In response to Claimant’s reference to the total number of tests it conducted, Respondent
notes that failed tests or tests using different metallurgical processes cannot serve to prove
Claimant’s mine plan and argues that “the issue is not a magic number of tests but rather
the total number of tests in relation to the size of the deposit and its variability so that the
mining company can arrive at a reasonable conclusion.” Referring to Prof. Spiller,
Respondent claims that Claimant would have been required to conduct at least 435 tests
using the metallurgical process it anticipated to test “the widest range of deposit
characteristics” in the entire ore body, including point test and tests on different
composites. By contrast, Respondent maintains that Claimant conducted “a total of 35
tests, out of which a sizable percentage failed to reach the accepted range of

recoverabilities and none of which tested material at cut-off grade.”>**

527. Respondent further considers that its independent analysis has “conclusively shown’ that
Reko Diq has variable recoverabilities and that the 21 tests performed by Claimant are
not reliable, as demonstrated by the samples that Prof. Dagdelen took from his site visit
to Reko Dig. Respondent contends that the results of the tests conducted by RDi
laboratory on samples from the same composites as Claimant had tested, which are shown
in Tables 3 and 4 in Prof. Spiller’s second report, show variability between the samples
when the same process is applied to all of them. According to Respondent, any buyer
would have proceeded in the same manner as Pakistan did, i.e., by sampling and testing
certain material to verify the consistency within a given set of samples, and it would have
discovered as Respondent did that it could not duplicate Claimant’s results because,

instead, these tests show variability.°?>

528. Respondent refers to the conclusion drawn by Prof. Spiller:

“Based on the comparative sampling and testwork, it is apparent that the
various ore samples, both ore type and variability type samples, produce
inconsistent results when following the same procedures. The inconsistencies

response variability, both internally to the RDi results and the AMMTEC
results, cast doubt on the feasibility study and the ability to achieve
consistently high value-recovery at marketable concentrate grades.”**®

529. In response to the argument that the samples in the core shed used for Pakistan’s testing

have oxidized in the meantime, Respondent “maintains that the core was competent for
the purposes of its testing.” However, Respondent claims that if the Tribunal were to
follow Claimant’s argument that it is not, it should find that Claimant did not adequately
preserve the core and destroyed any value in that core for a future buyer, resulting in
additional costs and uncertainty and another reason to reject any DCF valuation.”

Respondent emphasizes that Claimant also claims damages deriving from the Expansion
Pre-Feasibility Study even though, according to Respondent, Claimant’s testing program
shows that “any attempt to mix ore from Tanjeel with ore from H14 and H15 produced
very poor results,’ with the one test conducted showing recoverabilities at 60%.
Respondent further submits that no tests were conducted with H-13 ore. Noting that none
of Claimant’s experts referred to the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Respondent
concludes that “[t]here is no technical basis to arrive at any conclusion regarding the
processing necessary for the EXP PFS, meaning the costs have no foundation, the mine
plan is baseless, the pit limits are a guess, and every other element associated with the

processing of EXP PFS is no more than speculation.”>**

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

The dispute between the Parties concerns two issues: (i) whether Claimant collected
adequate and sufficient metallurgical samples which are representative of the different
types of rock contained in the ore body at Reko Diq; and (ii) whether the metallurgical
testing conducted by the laboratory assigned by Claimant, AMMTEC, was adequate and
showed the consistent high recoveries reported in the Feasibility Study.

The Tribunal will address these two issues in turn.
i. Whether the Metallurgical Samples Were Representative of the Ore
Body

First, the Tribunal will analyze Respondent’s allegation that the metallurgical samples
collected by Claimant do not adequately represent the entire ore body. In this regard,
Respondent argues in particular that the number of metallurgical samples was too low

and that the samples were largely taken from depths above 450 meters and, for the final
set of tests, even from depths above 250 meters.

The Tribunal notes that there is agreement between the Parties and their experts that the
metallurgical samples should be representative of the geo-metallurgical domains found at
Reko Digq. As defined in the Glossary of Terms used in the CIM Best Practice Guidelines
for Mineral Processing, domains are “commonly known as geometallurgical units or end
members defined as mineral assemblages that have a common mineralogical feature that
is expected to have a specific metallurgical response.”*°? Mr. Rossi provided the
following description of geo-metallurgical domains:

“A geo-metallurgical domain is essentially a group of rocks that have

statistically similar metallurgical properties in that they are of the same rock

type, have similar alteration styles and the like. Since the rocks within a

domain are alike, they will exhibit similar metallurgical characteristics and

respond in the same way to the recipes used to extract the metals from the

rock — regardless of where in the ore body they are located.”®

Respondent and its expert Prof. Dagdelen do not appear to challenge the validity of
identifying domains or the identification of a total of 12 domains in Reko Diq. However,
their argument is that Claimant has not conducted sufficient tests to verify the consistency
of the domains it has identified at Reko Diq. In particular, Prof. Dagdelen takes the view
that there are not sufficient metallurgical samples coming from depths below 450 meters
that would allow Claimant to assume that the rock at those depths would provide the same
metallurgical response as the rock closer to the surface. Prof. Dagdelen stated in his first
report:

“After reviewing the shipments of all the metallurgical test samples from the

Reko Dig Project between May 2007 and December 2009, it was found that

almost all of the metallurgical samples tested for the comminution work as

well as for the flotation process at H14 and H15 come from the upper 450

meters of pit depth. As a result, these samples are not sufficient and

representative of ore types to be mined and processed from these deposits

because these pits extend to the depths of 780 meters and 765 meters during

the life of the mine.”!

536. As pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Dagdelen referenced in this context an interim report
prepared by AMMTEC in March 2009 rather than AMMTEC’s final report.© These
reports will be addressed in further detail below.

537. In response to Prof. Dagdelen’s opinion, Mr. Rossi explained in his report that
“metallurgical sampling is not independent of all other geological data and drilling.
Rather, it relies on exploration and resource definition drilling to build the geo-
metallurgical domains, which are based on a geologic model and an understanding of
the impact of certain geologic vaiables on the overall beneficiation process.” He
further stated:

“Once you understand the relevant geological properties and build the geo-

llurgical de ins, the llurgical ling can then target those
domains, irrespective of the depth from which the material comes. This is
standard practice in the industry and is also justified by economic
considerations. Metallurgical test work, especially if done at a pilot plant
scale, requires large volumes of samples that are often drilled using larger
and more expensive drilling equipment.

 

Where material closer to the surface fairly represents the relevant domain,
you do not need to collect further samples from deeper within the deposit, as
you know the metallurgical response of those samples will be similar. You
only need to do further sampling at certain depths if the geology shows that
material found at specific depths represents a different domain and, further,
that domain is expected to be subjected to mineral processes in the future.”°*

538. Mr. Rossi explained that such a different domain, which exists only at a certain depth,
was in fact found at Reko Dig, referred to as lithology VFL. Claimant illustrated the
domains at Reko Diq, including lithology VFL in blue at the bottom of the pit, as
follows:

539. Prof. Dagdelen described in his first report that samples from the VFL lithology had been
taken from depths between 400 and 700 meters:
“As part of Shipment 4, TCCA also shipped 15 samples of finely laminated
volcanic rock samples with SCC type alteration (VFL — SCC ore type
samples) in blue drums. Since the very finely laminated volcanic rocks is
located close to the sandstone layers towards the bottom of the volcanic
layers, 8 of these holes representing this ore type at the intervals between
400m and 600m depths while one hole went down to 700m depth.”©°
540. In his second report, Prof. Dagdelen referred to the metallurgical domains identified in
the Wester Porphyries at H-14 and H-15 which are based on: (i) the three lithologies VFL,
VIN (depicted in green above) and PFB (depicted in orange above); and (ii) alteration
types, as illustrated by Claimant through the following matrix: °°”

541. Prof. Dagdelen described the depths from which the metallurgical samples for each

domain had been taken with the following chart:

Table 2: Ore Type and DWT Sample Locations and Depth Intervals in H14
ornnao

 

Table 3: Ore Type and DWT Locations and Depth Intervals in H15

 

Prof. Dagdelen’s chart confirms that the samples for domains including the VFL lithology
were taken from depths ranging between 250 and 600 meters. On that basis, the Tribunal
considers it undisputed the metallurgical samples were taken from depths below 450
meters for the domains including the VFL lithology.

As illustrated by Claimant, the VIN domains exist only on top of the VFL domains and
were therefore taken from depths ranging between 0 and 300 meters. There appears to be
no dispute regarding the depth from which samples for the VIN domains were or should
have been taken.

In the Tribunal’s view, the remaining question is therefore whether it was reasonable for
Claimant to conclude based on the available data that the vertical PFB domains, i.e., the
porphyries, ranging from the surface to the bottom of the ore body were sufficiently
consistent to allow for metallurgical samples to be taken from shallower depths.

Prof. Dagdelen referred to the PFB domains in his second report when stating that
“significant ore type domains characterized by the porphyry lithologies, alterations, and

mineralization zones were only represented by one or two metallurgical samples coming
from mostly near surface samples. As such, the metallurgical floatation test results that
are based on samples coming from near surface are insufficient and not representative
of many of the ore types that extend from surface to 800m below surface containing more

than 100 millions of tonnes of material in these ore types.”°*

Prof. Dagdelen considered it contradictory for Mr. Rossi to argue on the one hand that it
was irrelevant whether the rock within the porphyries was coming from 200 meters or
600 meters below the surface but to state on the other hand that the samples for
metallurgical testing are composites comprised of rock from many different holes so as
to reasonably represent the domain even if the specific metallurgical samples are not taken
from deeper portions of the mine.®” Prof. Dagdelen therefore maintained his conclusion:

“Since there are not many metallurgical tests done on samples representing

the many ore types coming from ore type domains below the 450m from the

surface, no one can predict the metal recoveries of the flotation process in

these rocks reliably, except by speculating that their performance will be the

same as the rocks in the domains that are located near surface to above the

450m depth. In other words, the composites created lacked the samples from

the lower part of the mine, meaning that the composite is no better than its

inputs.”°"
The Tribunal agrees with Prof. Dagdelen to the extent that it would not appear plausible
to test the metallurgical consistency of a domain by using samples from only the upper
part of the mine, i.e., in order to verify whether the upper and lower parts of the mine
even constitute a common domain as defined by the CIM Guidelines or to test for any
remaining variability within the domain. However, the Tribunal does not believe that this
is the case here. As explained by Mr. Rossi, the domains were identified before the
samples were taken for the specific purpose of metallurgical testing. The Tribunal finds
his explanation plausible that, as metallurgical testing requires large volumes of material,
the domains and thus the types of material that will have to be tested are narrowed down
and identified beforehand. The Tribunal also considers it plausible that once domains
have been identified and it has also been verified that no more than a reasonable variance
exists within these domains, the large volume of samples required for metallurgical
testing can then be taken from shallower depths.

Mr. Rossi has shown that Claimant’s previous drilling campaigns extended to 900 meters

below the surface with an average distance of 70 meters (except for depths below 800
meters where the average density extended to 100 meters):°!!

information available. Data from the surface (top-most horizontal line) to the bottom (bottom-most
horizontal line) of the pit —i.e., for the entire life of the mine — is quite constant. One can see that the
data is less dense (with a higher average distance) only below the pit bottom.

549. Mr. Rossi explained that an average distance of 70 meters commonly appears in other
copper porphyry deposits to classify resources as “indicated”. In his opinion, the density
of the data obtained through these drilling campaigns is “very high” compared to other
deposits, in particular because the same level of data density extended to the entire life of

the mine.*!? Mr. Rossi explained:

“While the drilling density shown in Figure 5 is used mostly for resource
estimation, it is also relevant to metallurgical test work in two ways:

(a) The logic model, the logical de ins, and the llurgical
domains are all supported by that data. To be clear, the geo-
metallurgical domains are NOT defined from metallurgical holes, but
from the resource definition holes shown in Figure 5.

(b) The composites used for at least some of the metallurgical testing can
also contain material partially taken from those SAME exploration drill
holes. This will happen mostly in the initial phases of testing, which are
performed at bench scale, with specific intervals chosen from different
drill holes to reflect the geo-metallurgical domains. Later in the life of
the project, as knowledge of the domains gets refined, specific
metallurgical holes are drilled, usually at a much larger diameter
(‘PQ,’ or approximately 85mm in diameter) than that of the resource
drill holes (“HQ,’ or 61mm in diameter). The large-diameter (PQ) holes

are a convenient method to extract from the relevant domains the
significant tonnages required for pilot plant testing (typically, a final
metallurgical testing step prior to detailed plant design in a Feasibility
Study). This sequence was basically what happened at Reko Dig.”°'

550. Neither Respondent nor its experts specifically challenge Mr. Rossi’s explanation that the
definition of geo-metallurgical domains was made before the specific metallurgical holes
were drilled and is thereby based on data obtained from previous drilling campaigns
which extended to the full depth of the ore body. In the Tribunal’s view, it is therefore
not convincing to look only at the depths from which the metallurgical samples were
taken when analyzing whether Claimant has adequately classified the domains and/or
whether it has verified that the rocks classified into a certain domain do not exceed a
reasonable variance in terms of their metallurgic response.

551. This does not yet answer the question, however, whether Claimant has, based on the data

 

it had collected through its previous drilling campaigns, adequately classified and verified
the domains at Reko Diq or whether there is any indication of variability as alleged by

Respondent and its experts.

552. During the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Dagdelen did “not necessarily” agree with the
proposition that materials coming from a certain domain, once appropriately defined, will
respond the same way metallurgically but maintained that “[t]hey have a lot of variability
down a given domain.” In response to the question whether he had tested the variability
within domains on the samples he had obtained during his site visit to Reko Diq, he
testified that it “wasn’t [his] job or [his] expertise area to test the variability of the
material performance recoveries within these domains” and confirmed that he had not

done any tests to this effect.°!4

553. Prof. Spiller, who reviewed the samples used for testing to establish the design criteria
used in the Feasibility Study, also referred to a “variability” of the test results produced
by AMMTEC. In his second report, he concluded that these tests showed “significant
lower copper recovery on domain samples taken from below 250 meters in the deposit”
and that the design criteria are therefore unreliable.°!> Prof. Spiller based this conclusion
on recoveries measured by AMMTEC for the samples listed in the two tables from Prof.
Dagdelen’s second report, which he illustrated as follows:

within a given domain.*!’ He maintained that “those samples did come from deeper, and
they were more difficult to process” but confirmed that variability within any one domain
had “not been tested because no one has looked at recoveries within a domain with depth
... because there was no test done.” It became clear during Prof. Spiller’s oral testimony

or indicate variability of recoveries within a given domain. Prof. Spiller was rather
complaining that there was no data to show that no such variability existed:
“Q. Is there anything in the data? Can you point us to anything in the data

that would give you reason to think that somehow the domaining was so
wrong that you can't actually trust it?

A. [have nothing in the data. It is just not there. There is just no metallurgical

test in the deeper parts of the orebody in each domain.”*'®
In this regard, the Tribunal recalls Mr. Rossi’s explanation that the definition of domains
took place before the metallurgical sampling and testing and is based on data obtained
from previous drilling campaigns. Neither Prof. Dagdelen nor Prof. Spiller have analyzed
previous drilling data but maintained that the relevant samples were only those taken from
the metallurgical drill holes. At least as far as the process of defining geo-metallurgical
domains is concerned, the Tribunal is not convinced by this opinion. It appears to
contradict economic and common sense to assume that data from previous drilling could
not be used to identify domains and verify whether these were reasonably consistent
before starting to extract the large volumes required for metallurgical testing for each of
the identified types of material.

Consequently, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent’s argument that Claimant used
only samples from shallower depths for the purposes of identifying and verifying the
consistency of the ore body. Regardless of the precise number of samples collected for
metallurgical testing, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it is inaccurate to look at
these samples in isolation, without taking into account the large amount of data collected
through previous drilling and the corresponding knowledge about the ore body and its
domains that Claimant already had when starting its metallurgical sampling and testing.

In the absence of any specific challenge on the classification of domains based on data
from previous drilling and given that Prof. Spiller did not find any indication of variability
in the data he had reviewed, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that the classification
of domains was not made in accordance with industry standards. Consequently, the
Tribunal also does not agree with Respondent that the collection of metallurgical samples
for the PFB domains from depths above 450 meters rendered them inadequate and not
sufficiently representative of the ore body.

In addition, the Tribunal takes note of Mr. Rossi’s opinion that the drilling conducted by
Claimant at Reko Diq exceeded industry standards because it covered the entire body
rather than “only a significant or financially relevant portion of the deposit [which] is
usually covered.” He explained that “[c]ommon indicators that determine the depth to

which sampling is usually done include: (a) the initial five to 10 years’ operation; (b) the
project’s payback period; or (c) the project’s payback period plus a discrete number of
production years.”°'? He further pointed out that the envisaged payback period in the
Feasibility Study was 7.1 years.°7°

Respondent and Prof. Dagdelen repeatedly criticized the sampling as inadequate,
asserting that most of the metallurgical samples had been taken from depths above 450
meters. In response, Mr. Rossi pointed out in his report that, while the deposits at H-14
and H-15 extended to approximately 800 meters in depth, about 70-75% of the rock to be
mined at those two deposits would come from depths above the 450-meter line. For
Tanjeel and H-13, which would become relevant in the expansion scenario, all mining
was to occur above that depth. If taken together, 85% of the rock to be mined at those
four deposits would come from depths above the 450-meter line.*! Both Mr. Rossi and
Mr. Livesey explained that it would have taken at least 13 years of operations (under the
expansion scenario) before drilling would have first “hit” the depth of 450 meters.°?? Mr.
Livesey further explained that “even then, the material from or above 450 meters would
still be the bulk of our operation— in year 13, in fact, it was still 100% of the operation
(as the deepest bench being mined in year 13 was at, and not below, 450 meters below
the surface).” Based on the mine plan data from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Mr.
Livesey illustrated “the proportion of the overall tonnages that would come from above

450 meters until year 25 of our operations” as follows:°?

Respondent maintains that Claimant had to sample the entire ore body in order to be
certain that the ore would provide the recoveries it needed to economically extract the
minerals from the rock. The Tribunal takes note, however, of Mr. Livesey’s explanation,
which was confirmed by Mr. Rossi, that throughout the initial years of mining operations,
Claimant would have continued to learn about the resource and would have been able to
make adjustments to the metallurgical process if needed. Mr. Livesey described “[t]he
ongoing review and adjustment of mining and processing techniques [as] a normal part
of the mining business” and also “good financial practice” given that revenues from the
project can be used to fund additional drilling and testing.°* Mr. Livesey testified that
apart from the fact that they “knew that the material below 450 meters was also going to
respond similarly to the physical and chemical processes of comminution and
metallurgical recovery,” even if that had not been the case, “it did not make sense for
[them] to be concerned at this early stage with material below 450 meters that was only

going to be mined two and a half decades later.”°*

During the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Spiller agreed that at the stage of metallurgical

testing, the payback period and first several years of mine operation “are the most
important.”*® He then testified:

“Q. So, do you know how long it would take to penetrate down to even touch
the area below 450 meters?

A. I'm guessing it's 12 years or something like that.

Q. Okay. So it would be reasonable, at least, to concentrate your
metallurgical testwork on the part that you're going to reach in the first 10
years, let’s say; right?

A. Not if you’re creating a value, a sale price. You need to be able to figure
out what the value of that orebody is and how much of that copper and gold
is going to be recovered through the whole entire deposit.

Q. Yeah. But you don’t need as much testing. I mean, otherwise, what would
be the point of this rule, this general principle that you should prioritize the
early years of the deposit in your metallurgical testing? It’s got to be that it
means that you focus on that, and that you don't need to do the same level of
metallurgical testing on the stuff that you’re not going to reach for more than
a decade; right?

A. That’s not the principle that I follow. I think you need to sample the whole
entire orebody.”°"

project as “Qualified Person,” i.e., “Principal Metallurgist,” responsible, inter alia, for
the section on “Mineral Prcessing and Metallurgical Testing,” of the NI 43-101
Technical Report Updated Feasibility Study,°** Prof. Spiller was pointed to a sentence on
“Sample Selection” which stated, inter alia, that “[p]articular focus was made on material
likely to be mined in the first five years.”®? In that context, Prof. Spiller testified:

“Q. ... And so I think you probably do--..., that principle up before, that one

of the things you do when you do metallurgical work is you prioritize in your

intensity of focus the stuff that is going to be mined during the payback period,

during the early years; right?

A. Yes, I agree with that.

Q. And you do follow that principle in practice; right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, and that makes perfectly good economic sense because, of

course, once you’re operating a mine and once you're there and you're

digging, you will just continue to keep--I mean, it’s an iterative process all

the way through, and you'll continue to keep understanding and exploring the

Resource; right?

A. Yes. You always are exploring, yeah.”°

In the Tribunal’s view, Prof. Spiller’s oral testimony confirmed that even if Claimant had
limited metallurgical sampling to a depth of 450 meters, without having verified whether
the rock below 450 meters would provide a reasonably consistent metallurgical response
as Respondent and its experts allege, this would not have been unusual or below industry
standards because 450 meters would have fully covered at least 13 years of mining
operations during which additional drilling and testing could have occurred. The Tribunal
is aware that Prof. Spiller’s agreement with this approach concerned a different project
and that he appeared to take a different opinion with regard to the Reko Diq project
because this was about “creating a value, a sale price.” The Tribunal is not convinced,
however, by this distinction. When Claimant was preparing the Feasibility Study, it was
not contemplating to sell its investment to a third party but intended to build and operate
the mine itself. Neither Respondent nor its experts have argued that an approach which is
in accordance with industry standards when planning to build and operate a mine based
on a feasibility study would not be sufficient for the purposes of selling the same mine to
a third party.

564. Consequently, and in addition to its conclusion reached above that the collection of

565.

566.

metallurgical samples for the PFB domains from depths above 450 meters did not render
them inadequate or not sufficiently representative of the ore body, the Tribunal further
concludes that even if the results of the metallurgical testwork had been representative of
only the portion of material above 450 meters, this would have been in accordance with
industry standards and sufficient for a willing buyer in November 2011.

Finally, the Tribunal is also not convinced that the number of metallurgical samples
collected by Claimant was below industry standards. Prof. Spiller stated in his second
expert report that “an expected minimum number of sample/tests would be in the range of
435, based on 1 sample for each 5 million tonnes or ore” and therefore “far more than
the 21 tests used in the feasibility.”®' While it appears to be undisputed that Claimant
conducted more than one test on each of the metallurgical samples, the Tribunal
understands Prof. Spiller’s opinion to be that at least 435 samples should have been
collected in order for the samples to be representative of the ore body. In support of his
opinion, Prof. Spiller referred to the Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice, and
Control issued by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME) in 2002,
which states that “the number of samples should bear some correlation to the size, value
and variability of the deposit. Medium to large deposits typically have a sample of each

1-5 million tonnes of ore.”°*?

During the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Spiller was pointed to a section on “Practical
requirements” in the document issued by SME, which notes that “the best sample(s) for
testwork are composite samples’ and that “it is generally recommended that the team
create four to six composites.”©* In response to the proposition that this indicated that
when the source relied on by Prof. Spiller referred to samples, it was talking more about
the point samples rather than the number of composites, Prof. Spiller testified that
“[t]hat’s a fair reading of this document. I don’t agree with that.”®* Prof. Spiller agreed
that the 21 metallurgical samples he was referring to were composite samples. He then
testified:

“Q. Okay. Now, in fact, if you look at samples in the way I’ve described it, if

it’s point samples, you would agree with me that TCC and AMMTEC, in the

87,000 kilograms of material, had a lot more than 435 samples that they

analyzed; right?

A. They did. They took a lot of samples. I mean, they put the material
together.”°>

567. Mr. Rossi explained in his report that for the first two phases of metallurgical testwork,
approximately 32 tonnes of material were shipped to AMMTE; for phase 3 (Feasibility
Study) and phase 4 (Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study), approximately 56 tonnes of
material were shipped to AMMTEC.*** While Respondent initially alleged that “the vast
majority of the samples” was “compromised” due to a wrong categorization of
lithologies,” it did not dispute Claimant’ s explanation that the re-logging concerned only

phase 1 testwork for the scoping study and did not affect any subsequent test work in

phases 2 through 4. Therefore, the Tribunal considers this point moot.

568. Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal is not convinced that the number of
composite samples used for metallurgical testing was too low. Prof. Spiller acknowledged
that, on a “fair reading” of the SME recommendation, the number of at least 435 samples
he calculated referred to point samples rather than the composite samples which in turn
are composed of several point samples. The Tribunal also notes that the Feasibility Study
summarized the process to achieve representative composite samples as follows:

“In summary, the samples chosen for the FS metallurgical test work were
based on relative proportions of lithology and alteration types in the mine
plan V10 and within pit limits. The samples were also chosen to approximate
grades over the life of mine for each lithology/alteration ore type, and
maintain a broad distribution throughout the ore body.

Based on both lithology and alteration, the ore types for deposits H14 and
H15 form a sound basis for differentiating metallurgical ore types, and
assessing the representivity of metallurgical samples and composites.

Composite construction was based on selecting, wherever possible, multiple
intervals of similar lithology/alteration ore types throughout the deposit,
compositing to achieve Cu and Au grades roughly proximal to anticipated
mine plan grades, as well as compositing pilot plant samples via mine plan
based proportions of ore types.

Samples collected for FS pilot plant test work were found to be reasonably
representative. Composites were blended to reflect the proportions of each
lithology and alteration type according to the V10 mine plan. HPGR samples
collected represent the dominant ore types.

Flotation Locked Cycle (LC) composites used to assign recovery and
concentrate grades to the block model represent the full suite of main Western
Porphyries ore types in both the H14 and H15 deposits.”°*

569. In the Tribunal’s view, it is apparent that each composite sample consisted of a
considerable number of point samples and, based on data obtained through Claimant’s
previous drilling campaigns, was compiled with the specific aim to be representative of
actual mining operations at Reko Dig.

570. Prof. Dagdelen’s only and Prof. Spiller’s main criticism regarding the composition of the
samples concerned the depths from which the material for the composite samples was
taken. This aspect has been addressed in detail above.

S71.

Prof. Spiller further criticized that the samples did not include material at cut-off grade.
Claimant pointed out, however, that Prof. Spiller did not rely on AMMTEC’s final report
dated December 2009 but rather on an interim report dated March 2009. According to
Claimant, AMMTEC’s final report shows that it in fact did perform tests at cut-off
grade. To the Tribunal’s knowledge, the final report is not in the record of this
arbitration.“? During the Hearing on Quantum, Claimant’s metallurgy expert Dr.
Anderson confirmed, however, that “[w]ithin the testing campaign and in actuality in the
final test used to define the design criteria, ... there were tests done at exactly the cutoff
grade.”**' He was not cross-examined on this point.

572. Prof. Spiller’s criticism on cut-off grade was raised together with his opinion that material
from deeper parts of the deposit showed lower recoveries than material from shallower
depths.? The Tribunal has already concluded above that Prof. Spiller’s analysis
underlying his conclusion that material from deeper parts of the deposit showed lower
recoveries did not show variability of recoveries within a certain domain. In addition, the
Tribunal is also not convinced that across the domains, material coming from the deeper
part of the mine generally showed lower recoveries than material from shallower depths.

573.

o

During the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Spiller was pointed to the results of DWT-14 and
DWT-12 on the tables he had used, which did not show a correlation between lower
recoveries and increasing depth. He responded that Claimant was “appreciating or
lending too much credence to the details of this” but maintained that “[w]hat we're
looking at is, in general, where those samples came from, and they came--they are
shallow samples, and there's a couple that are deeper, and I think it's quite obvious that
as you go deeper, you get lower recoveries.” Prof. Spiller further agreed that the highest
gold recovery had occurred in the second deepest hole but pointed out that “gold analyses
are quite irregular, and they are notoriously different, based on the ability to analyze the

tailings accurately or the throwaway” and maintained that “again, what I’m saying is,
just look at this table in general.”**4

In addition to the fact that Prof. Spiller had to recognize during the Hearing that his
conclusion did not prove to be valid on each of the composites, he further confirmed that
he was aware that DWT-8, i.e., the composite comprising material from the deepest hole
with the lowest recoveries in H-15 according to the table he had presented, was later
retested and achieved an improved recovery once Claimant and AMMTEC had further
tweaked the process. While he could not confirm the precise recovery of 93.5% that was
put to him, he acknowledged that “[i]f that’s exactly what happened, it would [undermine

his analysis in these charts].”°*°

As pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Spiller did not rely on the final report prepared by
AMMTEC for his analysis but rather on an interim report dated March 2009. While the
final report is not in the record of this arbitration, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller
acknowledged and had apparently been aware prior to his oral testimony that certain
recoveries improved following the interim report on which he had relied for his analysis.
Also taking into account the fact that his analysis did not prove valid on certain drill holes
even on the data from the interim report, the Tribunal considers that it cannot give much
weight to his conclusion that recoveries were lower for material from deeper parts of the

mine.

Respondent and Prof. Spiller further criticized Claimant for not having done tests on point
samples instead of or in addition to the tests of composite samples. However, the Tribunal
recalls that the SME on which Prof. Spiller relied considers that “the best sample(s) for
testwork are composite samples.” The SME further states that “[e]xcessive compositing
(i.e. production of large, overall composites) can mask valuable metallurgical response
information and can give misleading conclusions about the actual plant performance.
Therefore, it is generally recommended that the team create four to six composites.”**°
Given that, even on Respondent’s case, Claimant conducted tests on a total of 21
composite samples, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that this approach was not in
accordance with industry standards.

Finally, Respondent criticized Claimant for having relied on composites to test variability
but, as has also been addressed above, the classification of domains and verification that
they were reasonably consistent had been done before the metallurgical tests on the
composite samples.

is convinced that the metallurgical sampling conducted by Claimant was adequate and in
line with industry standards.

ii. Whether the Metallurgical Testing Produced Variable Recoveries

Respondent further argues that the metallurgical testing carried out by AMMTEC in
2007-2009 produced variable recoveries and considers this confirmed by the results of
tests performed by RDi laboratory on samples taken by Prof. Dagdelen during his site
visit to Reko Dig. Respondent refers to its expert Prof. Spiller who reviewed both
AMMTEC’s and RDi’s test results and concluded in his first report:
“Based on the comparative sampling and testwork, it is apparent that the
various ore samples, both ore type and variability type samples, produce
inconsistent results when following the same procedures. The inconsistencies
are independent of feed sample lithology/alteration and grade. The flotation
response variability, both internally to the RDi results and the AMMTEC
results, cast doubt on the feasibility study and the ability to achieve
consistently high value-recovery at marketable concentrate grades.”°*"

In his second report, Prof. Spiller maintained his conclusion.™*

Dr. Anderson disagreed with Prof. Spiller’s conclusion:

“In my opinion, the Reko Dig Feasibility Study is robust, and the underlying
methodology and metallurgical testing are of excellent quality. TCC
conducted many phases of metallurgical test work on many tonnes of Reko
Diq material, originating from thousands of samples, which were
representative of the orebody’s relevant lithologies and alterations (or
‘domains’). This included not only laboratory testing (open- and locked-
cycle, as well as variability, tests), but also pilot-plant test work.”°*?

Dr. Anderson pointed out that neither Prof. Dagdelen nor Prof. Spiller had referred to
AMMTEC’s metallurgical test reports of July 2009 or September 2009 but had compared
the RDi results only to Claimant’s March 2009 tests.°° According to Dr. Anderson,
however, “[t]hrough both the laboratory and pilot-plant tests, TCC validated the
technologies it would use at Reko Dig, obtaining recoveries above 90% Cu and
concentrate grades of approximately 30%.”

In Dr. Anderson’s opinion, RDi had, by contrast to AMMTEC, not been presented with
representative quantities of samples and both the samples and the testing had “many

shortcomings,” which rendered the results “not directly comparable” to AMMTEC’s

results."

In any event, Dr. Anderson pointed to Prof. Spiller’s statement that “[o]n average the
AMMTEC results produced a slightly higher Cu recovery (90.5 vs 87.2) while with
respect to Cleaner 2 concentrate Cu grade the average was virtually the same (22.3 vs
22.8) [i.e., slightly higher grades for RDi’s tests].” In his opinion, where RDi’s results
are compared to comparable tests performed by AMMTEC, the results are in fact “very
similar” and “tend to corroborate that TCC’s proposed flotation method was robust and

produced consistent recoveries across the various relevant metallurgical domains.”®?

In response, Prof. Spiller stated that “the pilot plant results, often referred to by Dr.
Anderson, were not used to establish copper and gold recovery data used as the basis of
the feasibility study and economics of the project presented therein.” He explained that
“pilot plants are conducted on composite samples representative of large swaths of the
ore and are not representative of ore that the production plant is likely ever to be fed on
a given day, over a week, or month, or often even a year” and that “[t]herefore,
appropriately, the basis for feasibility design is based on locked-cycle tests conducted on
individual alteration units, and should have included tests on un-composited variability
samples characterized as representing extremes in grade and alteration.”®*4 On that
basis, Prof. Spiller continued to discuss the results of AMMTEC’s March 2009 interim
report, which he considered to be the only relevant tests for determining the design criteria
used in the Feasibility Study.

With respect to Dr. Anderson’s report, he considered:

“Many of the criticisms in the Expert Report of Dr. Anderson are directed at
comparisons with the pilot plant testing and the representativeness of the RDi
samples in relation to the entire set of testwork done at Reko Dig. It is
important to return to the results in Spiller March 20, 2018. Those tests and
the results showed variability, which formed the basis for my conclusions. In
reviewing Dr. Anderson’s report, there is little challenge to the variability of
the results, which was the focus of the tests done for my first report. Because
the criticisms do not go to variability, I do not see the need to respond in-
depth to each of Dr. Anderson’s criticisms.”°°

He further maintained his conclusion that “after considering the arguments of Dr. Corby
G. Anderson, the variability of flotation response demonstrated in the AMMTEC work
and the RDi work does not support the Design Basis establishing a minimum performance

of 91.3 percent copper recovery and 64.2 percent gold recovery throughout the life of
mine as presented by the August 2010 TCC Reko Dig Feasibility Study.”°°

During the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Anderson testified in direct testimony that the
design criteria for the Feasibility Study were established based on “the whole body of
work from 17 May 2007 up until December 2009, including the three pilot-plant runs, as
well as further understanding and optimization of some of the earlier testwork that was
done and reported in March.” Dr. Anderson explained that “in March, these results came
out and AMMTEC and TCC decided that they need to work on a few areas” and
specifically identified the result of composite DWT-8, which had a low recovery of 87.6
in March 2009 and, after the pilot work and locked-cycle test, reached a recovery of
93.5% .°57

The Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller made it specifically clear in his third report that his
conclusion that the AMMTEC results had shown variability was based exclusively on the
test results of the 21 composite samples reported in the March 2009 interim report. He
dismissed Dr. Anderson’s reference to subsequent tests and in particular the pilot plant
test results by arguing that these results were “not used to establish copper and gold
recovery data used as the basis of the feasibility study and economics of the project

presented therein.”°*

. Dr. Anderson disputed this statement by stating:

“[T]his early work from March that's portrayed here led them to do more
work that led into three pilot campaigns. So, you do a pilot plant to, one,
confirm what you're doing, and then take it up to the next level so that you
can see at an operational level rather than just a bench scale that the
equipment you're going to choose and the parameters, your key process
indicators, are correct.

And so, the best thing you can have in a pilot plant is to try it out and find out
a little bit is wrong or something is wrong because you can fix it before you
get in the operation. So, you see through the pilot plant, progressively, they
got better.

If you look in the Feasibility Study, they compared their results from the pilot
plant to the locked-cycle projections they had, and they correlated quite
well.”6?

In response to Prof. Spiller’s statement that “pilot plants are conducted on composite
samples representative of large swaths of the ore and are not representative of ore that

the production plant is likely ever to be fed on a given day, over a week, or month, or
often even a year,” Dr. Anderson testified:

“T don't understand that exactly because you're just taking it up to the next
step, and you're using materials from the same orebody, but you're using them
on a larger scale in the proposed equipment and flow sheet that you plan on
using. So, it's a good way to test out your design and then modify if there's
issues.

And in the mining process--having actually run a copper flotation circuit--
you're always receiving wide swaths of ore that you have to deal with. So, you
can learn in the pilot plant, if you run an open-cycle test--it's a batch process-
-you have a one-shot deal. Right? And if you run locked-cycle testing on the
bench, you may go anywhere from six to ten cycles to see if you get it closed,
but it's still on the bench. So, you haven't actually applied any engineering or
operational input or output.

So, when you run the pilot plant on material from the same deposit, over a
period of time, you can see how you're operating, you're learning. And, also,
it is quite common that people will blend ores in order to--in operations, blend
them so that they can have a more consistent feed. You know, it allows you to
learn and understand and make your design that much better.”°°

592. The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ experts disagree on which of AMMTEC’s test results
formed the basis of the process design criteria and the recovery data reported in the
Feasibility Study. Prof. Spiller referred in his third report to the Executive Summary of
the Feasibility Study, which reported:

“Metallurgical results used as the basis of the FS are obtained from locked
cycle tests using samples representing the various lithology/alteration rock
types. Copper recovery is consistently high, ranging from 91.3% to 93.1%.
Gold recovery varies from 64.2% to 73.1%, being higher in the early years.
Concentrate grade is generally in the 28-31% range and gold grades are
generally in the 10 to 15 g/t range until the last few years of run-of-mine ore
production.®>!

593. Prof. Spiller concluded from this quote that the pilot plant results were not used to
establish the copper and gold recovery data. He then presented the recovery data from the
21 composite samples reported in the March 2009 reports.° Dr. Anderson pointed out
in his direct testimony, however, that the recovery and ore grade data and thus the design
criteria used in the Feasibility Study is contained in Tables 6.46 to 6.48 of Chapter 6 on

Metallurgy and Process Development. He further confirmed that the data in these tables
are different from the data presented by Prof. Spiller.°*

As pointed out by Dr. Anderson, the copper recoveries presented by Prof. Spiller in his
third report indeed do not match the recoveries reported in Table 6.46 of the Feasibility
Study. Specifically, the copper recoveries in the test results presented by Prof. Spiller
range between 87.6% (for DWT-8 discussed above) and 93.8%;° Table 6.46 reports
copper recoveries ranging between 90.1% and 95.8%.°°° As for the gold recoveries, there
is only a slight difference in the overall recovery range. However, individual test results
also differ. For example, the recovery for the domain VIN-SCC at H-15 was at 54.8% in
March 2009;°°” in the Feasibility Study, it was reported to be at 70.2%.°* Similarly, the
recovery for the domain VIN-MIX at H-14 was at 57.4% in March 2009;° in the
Feasibility Study, it was reported to be at 68.1%.°”°

As for the range of recoveries included in the Executive Summary of the Feasibility Study
on which Prof. Spiller based his conclusion that the design criteria in the Feasibility Study
rely exclusively on the results of the March 2009 report, it appears to the Tribunal that
the paragraph quoted by Prof. Spiller does not report the range of individual recoveries
but rather an average of recoveries over time, given its note that “[g]old recovery varies
from 64.2% to 73.1%, being higher in the early years.”®"! In any event, these recovery
ranges would also not match the recoveries of the March 2009 tests that Prof. Spiller
presented as the alleged exclusive basis for the Feasibility Study’s design criteria.

In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that the recoveries reported in Chapter 6 on Metallurgy
and Process Development of the Feasibility Study are higher than those presented by Prof.
Spiller not only confirms that the Feasibility Study was not based exclusively on the tests
presented and analyzed by Prof. Spiller. It also corroborates Dr. Anderson’s testimony
that after these test results in March 2009, “AMMTEC and TCC decided that they need to
work on a few areas” and improved, for example, the recovery of composite DWT-8
based on further tests conducted by AMMTEC until December 2009.

597. As Prof. Spiller specifically confirmed that his analysis of variability of the AMMTEC
test results is based entirely on the results of AMMTEC’s March 2009 interim report,°”
the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot attach much weight to this analysis, which does
not take into account subsequent testing conducted by AMMTEC until December 2009.
In addition to the fact that the recoveries relied on by Prof. Spiller do not match those
reported in the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal also finds Dr. Anderson’s testimony
plausible that the design criteria were established based on the entire test work conducted
by Claimant and AMMTEC on the metallurgical process rather than only the 21 tests
pointed to by Prof. Spiller. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and Prof. Spiller
that tests preceding the optimization of the process in early 2009 may not be as decisive
at this point because they did not form the basis for the reported recoveries, the Tribunal
does not consider it plausible that tests following the March 2009 report, which resulted
in further improved recoveries until December 2009, would not be incorporated into the
Feasibility Study.

598. In addition and while Prof. Spiller maintained that pilot plant tests could not be used for
the definition of design criteria, Dr. Anderson explained that after March 2009 AMMTEC
conducted not only the pilot plant tests but also an additional 30 locked-cycle tests whose
results were incorporated into the recoveries reported by AMMTEC in December 2009.
He further explained that “they were vetting their pilot-plant results with locked-cycle
testing.” As pointed out by Dr. Anderson, the results of this vetting were summarized
in Table 6.31 of the Feasibility Study:

599. Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal concludes that it would not be correct

to look at the test results reported in AMMTEC’s March 2009 interim report in isolation
and to ignore the additional test work done by Claimant and AMMTEC on the
metallurgical process until December 2009. As neither Respondent nor Prof. Spiller have
addressed the final test results reported by AMMTEC in December 2009, the Tribunal
also cannot follow the argument that AMMTEC’s test results show metallurgical
variability in a manner that would affect the value of Claimant’s investment.

As an additional argument, Respondent claims that the test results produced by RDi
laboratory on samples collected by Prof. Dagdelen during his site visit to Reko Dig have

“conclusively shown ... that Reko Dig has variable recoverabilities.”°"*

The Tribunal recalls that Dr. Anderson has raised several detailed criticisms regarding
the testing conducted by RDi, such as that the quantities of material were, in his opinion,
not sufficient to be representative samples and that there were what he considers to be
shortcomings in the technical processes employed by RDi. In addition, Dr. Anderson
criticized Prof. Dagdelen and Prof. Spiller for their comparison of open-cycle tests with

locked-cycle tests.°”°

In response, Prof. Spiller expressed the opinion that “what is important is the variability
of results for the contemporary testing at RDi when tested following duplicated
procedures in the same laboratory conducted by the same personnel. Whether the tests
are Locked Cycle or Open Cycle, any variability will be present, and it is not necessary
to conduct only Locked Cycle tests to judge the variability of the recoveries.” Prof. Spiller
emphasized that the samples collected by Prof. Dagdelen “came from drill core generally
expected to represent material previously (historically) tested at AMMTEC. In fact, all
the samples contained copper and gold values within the expected ore grade for the
project. Further, all the samples responded to the crush/grind/float process following the
same protocol, including the same reagents.” He then stated that “[w]hat was not similar
was the variability of performance.” In his view, Dr. Anderson’s criticisms did not go to
variability and he therefore did not see the need to respond in-depth to each of Dr.
Anderson’s criticisms.°”°

In the Tribunal’s view, the argument raised by Respondent and Prof. Spiller appears to
be two-fold: (i) the test results produced by RDi allegedly show that AMMTEC’s test

677

results could not be duplicated by a buyer;°”’ and (ii) the test results produced by RDi

allegedly show variability among themselves so that even if the test conditions at RDi

were not identical to those at AMMTEC, the RDi test results alone show a variable

deposit.°”

As for the first argument, the Tribunal takes note of Dr. Anderson’s opinion that open-
cycle tests cannot be directly compared with locked-cycle tests and that the only valid
comparison drawn by Prof. Spiller with the locked-cycle tests reported by AMMTEC in
the March 2009 interim report therefore concerns the locked-cycle tests of RDi.°” In the
Tribunal’s view, the lack of comparability is confirmed by Prof. Spiller’s first report in
which he noted that “RDi conducted open cycle flotation tests following the standard
procedure with site water on six variability samples provided from Professor Dagdelen’s
site visit. The AMMTEC reports did not show directly comparable test results for what
were termed Drop Weight Test (DWT) composite samples. Instead, AMMTEC conducted
locked cycle tests on the DWT samples and modified the procedure to include
aeration.” Prof. Spiller then compared the results of RDi’s open cycle tests “a[s] well
as possible” to AMMTEC’s locked cycle test results and concluded that “[i]n virtually
every test the AMMTEC results produced higher recovery and higher concentrate grade

results.”

As pointed out by Dr. Anderson, RDi also conducted locked-cycle tests and Prof. Spiller
stated in his report that he had compared those to “similar tests by AMMTEC.” For this
comparison, he concluded that “[o]n average the AMMTEC results produced a slightly
higher Cu recovery (90.5 vs 87.2) while with respect to Cleaner 2 concentrate Cu grade
the average was virtually the same (22.3 vs 22.8). Differences in recovery and grade
results were similar with respect to Au, Ag, Fe and 8.7682

Given that Prof. Spiller himself considered the open-cycle tests not “directly comparable”
with AMMTEC’s test results, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to refer only to the
comparison of locked-cycle tests. There, Prof. Spiller did not find any large differences
between the AMMTEC and RDi results but only what he described as “a slightly higher
Cu recovery” while the copper average grade was “virtually the same.” He reached the
same conclusion for the other minerals found in these samples.

Against this background, the Tribunal is not convinced by the first argument that a buyer
would not have been able to duplicate the results achieved by Claimant. It would
contradict common sense to expect that the results would be identical and the fact that
they are within a close range rather corroborates the robustness of AMMTEC’s results.
The Tribunal therefore also does not consider it necessary to express an opinion on Dr.

Anderson’s criticisms regarding the representativeness of the material collected by Prof.
Dagdelen or the differences in methodology employed by RDi. The same applies to the
discussion between the Parties regarding an oxidation of the ore kept in the core shed at
Reko Dig from which Prof. Dagdelen collected the samples during his site visit.

For similar reasons, the Tribunal is also not convinced by Respondent’s second argument,
i.e., that the RDi results in themselves are proof of a variable deposit. If RDi’s results of
locked-cycle tests produced results showing that, across all minerals tested, recoveries
and grades were similar to those reported by AMMTEC, the Tribunal fails to see why a
willing buyer would have concluded from these results that the deposit was variable, i.e.,
that recovery ranges deviated from those on which the economics of the Feasibility Study
are based.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that the comparison drawn by Prof. Spiller between RDi
and AMMTEC test results concerned exclusively AMMTEC’s March 2009 test results.
In the Tribunal’s view, it is much more likely that a willing buyer wanting to verify the
recoveries relied on in the Feasibility Study would have looked at AMMTEC’s final tests
which actually formed the basis for the figures in the Feasibility Study. No such
comparison has been made and the Tribunal has no basis to conclude that a willing buyer
would have drawn any conclusion from a comparison with interim test results which were
superseded by subsequent locked-cycle tests as well as pilot plant test work.

Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that it has no reason to believe that the
metallurgical testing conducted by AMMTEC was inadequate or that such tests showed
variability that would have affected the value attributed by a willing buyer to Claimant’s
investment.

Whether Claimant Has Established That Its Plans for Project Execution Were
Adequate for a Project at the Development Stage of Reko Diq

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that it was committed to building the mine at Reko Diq and had
developed the necessary plans to do so. According to Claimant, “TCC’s Feasibility Study
covered all the technical aspects required to build a project of this scale, as well as the
capital and operating costs required to engineer, construct, and eventually operate both

the initial mine and the planned expansion case.”°*

Claimant refers to its expert Mr. Neil Cusworth, who conducted an independent peer
review of the Feasibility Study in 2011 and an additional detailed review in the context

of this arbitration and concluded that “TCC’s studies are in the top 10% of feasibility
studies in terms of content, quality and accuracy,” that they would have “allowed TCC,
and its owners Barrick and Antofagasta, to make a well-informed financial investment

decision,” and, finally, that the studies “were of bankable quality.”°**

Claimant rejects Respondent’s allegations regarding a “high likelihood of cost overruns
and delays” as well as “overly optimistic assumptions in its construction plan and cost
estimates” and refers to both Ms. Cusworth and Mr. Livesey as well as various sections
of the Feasibility Study which show in its view that “TCC’s mine plan included not only
the nature and location of the mine, but also identified the specific mining equipment and
processing facilities that would be used, how much and what kind of labor would be
required, and how the eventual concentrate would be stored and eventually
transported.”

Claimant submits that teams from Claimant, Antofagasta and Barrick, together with 13
expert groups conducted 46 trade off studies during feasibility stage and thereby
determined how to design, construct and operate the mine. As examples, Claimant points
to the pit design, drilling, hauling and mining support equipment, design of processing
facilities and the detailed drawings and process flow diagrams for key elements of the
mine.°*° It further refers to a forward work plan which identified and provisionally
budgeted for the next steps of the project and a section in the Feasibility Study on project
execution “detailing its eventual strategy on procurement, engineering, construction,
commissioning and eventual handover” and argues that “the company was ready and able

to actually build {the mine].”°*’

Claimant notes that the forward work plan provided for a 48-month schedule from
commencement of project engineering through to completion of construction, which Mr.
Cusworth reviewed and considered reasonable and in line with other large copper
projects.°*® Claimant emphasizes that this schedule did not include the project
commitment phase preceding project engineering during which it would have moved
ahead with certain steps such as the purchase of milling equipment for the processing
plant.°*° Claimant further points to ten main areas identified in the forward work plan,

which relate to project financing and project readiness, with preliminary plans to address

these areas after the feasibility stage.%°

616. Claimant considers that Respondent’s allegations of cost overruns and delays are ill-
founded and, in any event, would not affect Prof. Davis’ valuation.®?!

617. According to Claimant, the opinion of Respondent’s expert Mr. Owen should be attached
no weight because he started to offer opinions on various issues beyond the construction
aspects on which he initially was to comment and provided a “Jaundry list of conclusions”
none of which was based on any analysis or specific or material enough to affect the value
of the project. Claimant considers that following Mr. Cusworth’s analysis of the alleged
issues, Mr. Owen abandoned his allegations and notes that he even admitted at the
Hearing on Quantum that “as far as constructing goes, there [were] no big issues there
at Reko Dig.”

618.

oo

Claimant considers that from a technical point of view, the location of the site was “far
from challenging” and refers to Mr. Cusworth who considered that the “‘site of the mine
is ideal in terms of available areas for the project needs” and compared the location to
another project with several similarities regarding “topography, distances from ports and
infrastructure [and] weather conditions” which was delivered on time and on budget.°

619. Claimant further points to Mr. Owen’s testimony that he would be “the guy that has to
stand in front of the Board and help them make the Decisions, and then ... to go out and
execute in the field” and considers it confirmed that he had not undertaken the work
required to advise the Tribunal on Reko Digq given that Mr. Owen testified that he “took
the care and diligence that [he] would have on a first basis to talk to a Board of Directors

about whether they should move forward with thinking about investing in this Project.”©*

620. Claimant rejects Mr. Owen’s “refrain” that it dit not have its “eye on the ball’ and his
criticism that the Feasibility Study was allegedly missing a project execution plan. In
Claimant’s view, Mr. Owen conceded during the Hearing on Quantum that only a
preliminary project execution plan is required at feasibility stage and failed to provide
any reason why Claimant’s plan would not meet or even exceed what was required at that
stage of the project. Claimant emphasizes that Mr. Owen did not identify or criticize any
specific sections of the Feasibility Study in his second report but merely stated during the

Hearing on Quantum that he had “referred to the Project Execution Plan as being

woefully inadequate.”°

621. In response to the allegedly missing “critical” components that Mr. Owen identified for
the first time in his presentation during the Hearing on Quantum, Claimant provides a list
of references to those parts of the Feasibility Study in which, according to Claimant, each
of the items identified by Mr. Owen is addressed.°

622. Claimant further considers that, despite Respondent’s assertion that Claimant’s ramp up
assumptions were “wildly unrealistic,” there is no dispute between the Parties that Reko
Diq would be able to ramp up in the fastest category of mines. Claimant points to Mr.
Owen’s testimony that he would expect a ramp up time in the range of 12 to 24 months
and emphasizes that Prof. Davis even modeled a ramp up time in the range of 16 to 24
months in his revised model.” Claimant notes that Prof. Davis’ original model already
included an average delay of 2.3 years before construction starts and that his revised
model includes an additional delay of 21 months in ramp-up to full production after the
end of construction.°*

623. Claimant also refers to the residual risk value of USD 105 million in the Feasibility Study
to which Respondent and Mr. Owen pointed during the Hearing on Quantum. According
to Claimant, the residual risk value was “a measure of the Project’s sensitivity to capital
cost overruns, and one that proved that the project was sufficiently robust to withstand
such overruns.”®? Claimant then points to the following sections of the Feasibility Study:
(i) the Capital Cost contingency summary in which Claimant ascribed an individual
contingency amount to each discipline and category, which resulted in an overall
contingency of USD 326 million (corresponding to 11% of total capital cost); (ii) the
Capital Cost Section in which Claimant refrred to a residual risk assessment of USD 105
million and noted that “[t]he residual value has been recommended, but is not included in
the CAPEX or Sustaining Capital’; and (iii) the Residual Risk Assessment showing the
financial analysis used to determine this value and stating that its purpose is to show the
project’s owners that “there exists an 85% probability that threats materializing will cost
the project less than $105M.”7°°

Davis fed into his model and submits that “Prof. Davis, however, made even more
conservative assumptions about those risks than those made by the TCC team at the time
of the Feasibility Study and then incorporated those more conservative assumptions into
the valuation he has presented.” Therefore, if Claimant’s work had been inadequate,
Claimant contends that this would not affect Prof. Davis’ valuation.”°! Claimant points in
particular to Prof. Davis’ increase of the initial mine development capital costs by 58%
to account for the risk of cost overruns, which exceeds the amounts that Respondent’s
experts considered necessary.’°

Claimant also refers to Respondent’s reliance on a “rule of thumb” that a cost contingency
for a project in the developing world equals 20% of the project’s total expenditures and
maintains that the adjustments made by Prof. Davis exceed that number given that he
included a 21.4% cost increase due to escalation and a 10% contingency from Claimant’ s
studies.7°3

As for the overall contingency rate of 11% presented in the Feasibility Study, Claimant
explains that it is a blend of different contingencies varying from 5% to 25% depending
on the level of certainty that Claimant had regarding the various cost estimates.’ It refers
to Mr. Cusworth who explained:
“(T]he amount of contingency, therefore, varies according to the degree of
engineering design definition achieved. For example, mining equipment
prices are now sourced from existing fixed price global contracts with
selected suppliers. As a result, it is appropriate to reduce the level of
contingency for mining equipment to around 5%. Because of the level of
certainty, a lower contingency can be used.”?°

Finally, as for Respondent’s allegation that Claimant overestimated productivity of its
workforce and should have made use of the Gulf Coast Factor, Claimant contends that
the approach it took was more appropriate than “‘Pakistan’s arbitrary approach” because
no specific construction labor productivity factor existed for Pakistan when Claimant
prepared its studies. Claimant explains that it instead drew on productivity assumptions
and manpower estimates from local contractors and SNC Lavalin, which was familiar
with Pakistani labor from previous experience and obtained no less than three bids for
each major construction package, analyzing and comparing them to other projects in the

the estimates of labour hours and costs in painstaking detail” and that he further testified
that “[t]his comprehensive methodology goes well beyond the normal practices at

feasibility study stage and is a more accurate method that that suggested by Mr Owen.”"""

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

Respondent submits that, according to Claimant, Reko Diq is a “mega project” which
would have cost almost USD 3.3 billion in capital expenditures in order to get the mine
operational. Respondent claims, however, that the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study “failed to quantify sizable costs, adopted an overly aggressive
construction schedule that did not prepare for the requirements of building a mine in
Pakistan, and adhered to overly optimistic assumptions in its construction plan and cost

estimates.”7*

Respondent contends that the Feasibility Study was “a blueprint for another Mega
Project failure” and refers to the statistic presented by Mr. Owen at the Hearing on
Quantum pursuant to which “Mega projects” in the Asia-Pacific region frequently
experience significant cost and schedule overruns. According to Respondent, Claimant
has not challenged Mr. Owen’s years of “research, experience, and studied analysis”
showing that “Mega-projects are undeniably prone to failure.” Referring to
independent studies, Respondent submits that of the projects built in the mining industry,
“85% come in over budget, 75% fail to start up one time , and 75% do not meet operation
specifications” and adds that the “propensity for failing to meet feasibility studies is even
worse with ‘Mega’ Projects,” i.e., projects with a capital investment of over USD 1
billion.’!° Respondent submits that industry analysts have identified three “key factors”
in large project failures, i.e., not adhering to industry practice, management turnover, and
overly aggressive scheduling, and claims that Reko Dig “exhibited all the warning signs
of becoming a failure.”

Respondent argues that a “primary driver of these failures” are “over-eager Project
Advocates” which are solely concerned with getting the project approved and intend to
resolve issues in the future. According to Respondent, successfully delivered projects
require not only a feasibility study but also a fully detailed project execution plan (as

opposed to a single chapter in the feasibility study) and employ third parties to review the

feasibility study and confirm the project execution plan.’!”

631.

Respondent argues that the “real work” begins after the feasibility study where
“numerous unknowns arise during execution” and refers to Mr. Owen who testified that
there are significant problems where the feasibility study has “a determined Project
Advocate” who might lower the capital costs, use the best results for metal recovery,
minimize risk facts and lower the contingency in order to show a better IRR and hopefully
get board approval for the project.’!* According to Respondent, project advocates are
unreliable and “TCCA and its vendors fall solidly into this camp” as the Feasibility Study

and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study “display all of the problems of a Mega Project.”""*

632. Respondent argues that Claimant either under-spent on the Feasibility Study or failed to
present any capital expenditures for the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study and points to
what it considers identical tables of expenditures in both studies.7!° According to
Respondent, Mr. Cusworth conceded that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility table is a “cut
and paste” which, in Respondent’s view, is a “sign of hopelessly inadequate work by TCC
in overseeing this element of the EXP PFS.”"'® In any event, Respondent contends that
Claimant has failed to prove its expenditures in the project given that it only offered a
table “without any detailed breakdown and support” despite Respondent’s challenge that
“TCC duplicated many of its costs by having full teams from both owners where only one

team was necessary."

Respondent claims that spending USD 204 million on the Feasibility Study is “a rather
low number for a Megal Project” in comparison to the overall CAPEX and refers to Mr.
Own who testified that buyers would be looking for more than 2-3% of the project value

in expenditures and in fact would be expecting 3-5% to avoid the “overwhelming

frequency of cost blow-outs and developmental failures” in mega projects.’!*

634. Respondent further submits that Claimant had not carried out any detailed engineering
which, according to Respondent, forms a “key element of any feasibility study for a mega
project.” Respondent refers to Mr. Owen who testified that a mega project requires at
least 80% of the basic engineering and 15% of the detailed engineering before the

decision to go forward with instruction. He further explained that detailed engineering
shows how the different pieces of the project will work with each other when the project
is executed. According to Respondent, the absence of detailed engineering, despite the
absence of any experience of working in Pakistan, was “an important blind spot in TCC’s

preparations that it could not quantify.”7!

As for the requirement of having a project execution plan, Respondent considers that the
dispute between the Parties relates to the detail required of this plan and contends that the
“section on project execution” is not comparable to the “full, detailed execution plan”
without which a mega project “is primed to fail” due to cost overruns, scheduling flaws
and design failures.’”° Respondent argues that during the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Owen
described the missing elements such as a resource plan describing where people will come
from and what they will do, the 300 pages describing what an EPCM company would do,
the lack of operations readiness in the procurement plan or the lack of a plan for seeking
agreement with the tribes along the pipeline route and the actions of the owner at project
execution stage.’*! Respondent claims that “TCC did not know what it needed in a Project
Execution Plan” and therefore had no documents or questions to put to Mr. Owen in
response to his criticisms.’

According to Respondent, Mr. Livesey’s testimony supported the absence of a project
execution plan by confirming that Section 32 of the Feasibility Study describes a future
project execution plan and that numerous high-value items in the execution portion were
not finished even though the Feasibility Study described them as “essential.” Respondent
contends that “Reko Dig was not ready for execution and the costs and time that would
come with the work.”7

As for the ramp-up time of the project, Respondent emphasizes that Mr. Owen correctly
identified that the ramp up was “wildly unrealistic” because even those mines in the
fastest category (28% of the projects in the world) reach steady state production in no less
than 12-16 months and Claimant failed to provide any evidence that its project should be
classified in that category. Respondent further points out that Mr. Cusworth “didn’t see”
in its review of the Feasibility Study the unreasonably short ramp-up time to which
Claimant then ascribed hundreds of millioms of dollars. In Respondent’s view, this

confirms a lack of seriousness in his review and “dubious quality’ of Mr. Cusworth’s
testimony.’4 Respondent points out that the average ramp-up time is 16-18 months and
that mines on average achieve less than 70% of design capacity in the first year of
production and require more than two years to achieve 90% but maintains that Claimant
has failed to show that Reko Diq would achieve this performance.’?>

Respondent further considers it confirmed by Mr. Cusworth that there were no
productivity factors or other means to estimate the productivity of the workforce in the
Feasibility Study. Respondent also refers to Mr. Cusworth’s confirmation that it would
be difficult to predict how productive laborers might be in “unique” countries such as
Pakistan and his testimony that “[i]t’s very hard to get reliable productivity figures which
you can rely on. They can give you an indication, but you wouldn’t rely on them.” In
Respondent’s view, the Tribunal must therefore conclude that Claimant did not have the
detail available to reasonably estimate its ability to execute the project.’”°

Respondent submits that the mining industry uses the “Gulf Coast Factor,” which uses
the US Golf Coast as a baseline for productivity, to adjust the estimated man-hours for
the project. Respondent submits that there was a shortage of qualified labor in Balochistan
and contends that “[i]n all likelihood, the Gulf Coast Factor would have been high.” By
not using a Gulf Coast Factor and instead relying on estimates prepared by Pakistani
contractors, Respondent claims that Claimant failed to provide a realistic estimate of
construction time and cost. Respondent notes that Claimant acknowledged an increased
capital expenditure over over USD 130 million to account for the high risk of not finding
adequate labor due to the lack of technical skills but maintains that Claimant failed to
consider the possibility of delays in the construction schedule. According to Respondent,
Claimant also failed to include a productivity curve in the Feasibility Stusy to model

productivity over the life of the mine.’””

Respondent further asserts that Claimant “did not have the right people in charge”
because in particular Mr. Livesey, in its view, did not have the necessary experience and
his supervisor was, according to Respondent, engaged in a securities fraud in another
project. Respondent contends that Barrick was pushing the project forward even though
it “did not know how to run a copper project and could not even keep its gold mines

remotely close to their budget.” Respondent claims that “leadership failures at TCC

would have given any buyer further concern in purchasing Reko Dig.””*

Respondent further argues that the contingency calculated by Claimant was based on
“known-unknowns” and did not account for “unknown-unknowns” even though it had not
done the detailed engineering to identify these unknowns and therefore failed to include
at least 10-15% of project costs.’””? Respondent contends that for a project in the
developing world, “the rule of thumb is a cost contingency that equals 20% of the
project’s total capital expenditures.””° As for the “supplemental overrun facility”
described by Mr. Cusworth, which would include “unkown-unknowns,” Respondent
contends that Mr. Cusworth had no means to calculate the number which remained secret
and was based on “crude” estimates. According to Respondent, Claimant thereby failed
to provide the necessary certainty to apply modern DCF as no buyer would have had the

tools to calculate the future costs as the basis for its investment decision.”*!

Respondent also claims that Claimant failed to budget for “key items” such as a reverse
osmosis plant to treat the water from the Fan Sediments, which is relied on in Claimant’s
studies but does not appear as a purchase item, and many of the risks contained in the
residual risk assessment, which are identified but not quantified and therefore do not

appear in the capital expenditures or operating expenses.’**

Respondent submits that its
experts took the missing components of capital expenditures recommended in the
Feasibility Study and adjusted the cost contingency to 20%, which raised the total capital
expenditure estimate from USD 3,299 million to USD 3.667 million and, according to
Respondent, shows the magnitude of the errors made by Claimant but does not yet include
security costs, the “inevitable cost overruns,” or costs of bringing the mine to meet the

environmental standards.”>

Respondent further alleges that Claimant decided to leave out USD 105 million in
“owner’s cost” and points to Mr. Cusworth’s testimony that it was in the “supplemental
overrun facility’ whose number was unknown. According to Respondent, the likely
increase of costs by having to change from Light Sulfur Fuel Oil to Heavy Fuel Oil could
also not be found in the operating expenses, contingency or the risk register and would

therefore amount to “another case of millions of missing dollars.”°*

value” given that Claimant itself referred to further “adjustments” made by Prof. Davis
for items not listed in the risk register and therefore accepted that it had failed to “‘de-risk”
the project in respect of numerous areas of unknown costs such as security costs.
Respondent contends that: (i) Claimant failed to correctly add up the cost of the risk it
had identified which resulted in an error amouting to “hundreds of millions of dollars”;
and (ii) Claimant failed to include high-risk items such as theft for explosives which were
also worth “hundreds of millions of dollars.” According to Respondent, Prof. Davis has
also not assigned any value to this risk and in any event, Respondent maintains that the
project cannot be “‘de-risked” by Prof. Davis by adding costs to a model that relies on an

allegedly already “de-risked” project.”

Respondent also refers to the highly likely risk of a “direct violent attack in-country by
any hostile force,” which was again not assigned any risk in the risk register and could
not be explained by Mr. Cusworth who merely referred to the “risk specialists” and gave
shifting answers as to why the risk was not quantified.”*° Respondent further contends
that Claimant has failed to properly account for the risk of terrorism in its supply routes
by excluding the pipeline and only assigning a value to operating expenses but not the
capital expenditures to protect the supply routes before an attack occurred.’*” According
to Respondent, Claimant also failed to quantify other risks such as “criminal extortion
and kidnap caused by criminal groups possibly resulting in personnel harm, reputation
and financial loss,” not signing a Mineral Agreement or port approvals, all of which were
identified as a high risk.”°*

Respondent further contends that the risk register inappropriately reduced the risk for
items such as the absence of trained geologists even though Claimant had no plan in place
to mitigate this risk. According to Respondent, “[n]o after-the-fact mathematical
calculations can repair this kind of shoddy work.””*? Respondent concludes that the risk
register prepared prior to 2012 “contains millions, if not billions in missing values” and

“Davis/Brattle should not be able to turn a blind eye to these deficiencies.”

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

647. At the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties
that the Feasibility Study was not silent on project execution but that it contained a
Chapter 22 entitled “Project Execution” as well as a Chapter 32 entitled “Forward Work
Plan’.™' Claimant further points to a section containing detailed piping and

instrumentation drawings for the various processing steps of the mine.”?

648. The question for the Tribunal to determine is whether the plans that Claimant had
prepared as of November 2011 were, from the perspective of a buyer, adequate for a
project at the development stage of Reko Diq.

649. The Tribunal notes that both Respondent and its expert, Mr. Owen, have repeatedly
referred to studies showing that a considerable percentage of large-scale mining projects
experiences cost overruns and/or delays in their construction and ramp-up schedule.
While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and Mr. Owen that this information is
relevant to the extent that it shows that reasonable contingencies have to be factored into
a plan to build and operate a mine, such studies cannot, in and of themselves, serve as
evidence that Reko Diq would have experienced these cost overruns and/or delays. In
particular, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent’s general allegation that the Reko

Dig project “exhibited all the warning signs of becoming a failure.”™*

650. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Respondent itself makes the argument that “TCC
duplicated many of its costs by having full teams from both owners where only one team
was necessary.”"4 Mr. Owen also noted that “it normally requires 10-12 people to
prepare a feasibility study. The IMD FS had 23 people from TCC, showing that Barrick
and Antofagasta each wanted their own pair of eyes on everything.”"*> Respondent thus
does not dispute Claimant’s submission that the preparation of the Feasibility Study was
supervised by teams from both Antofagasta and Barrick. The Tribunal therefore also
cannot follow the suggestion that the team preparing the Feasibility Study was
inexperienced and was not aware of the necessary components of a feasibility study in
terms of planning project execution. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to
engage with Respondent’s allegation that Claimant “did not have the right people in
charge.””"° Apart from the fact that the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent’s
criticisms aimed specifically at the expertise of Mr. Livesey, the Tribunal also recalls Mr.

Livesey’s testimony in response to the question whether he thought that they had the right
team at TCC to help him lead the Feasibility Study:

“Absolutely. We had a very well-developed structure, both below me and
above me. What you have to remember is the structure of the team was not
only the Tethyan staff themselves, either seconded or recruited into Tethyan,
but for each main discipline oversight from both owners, Barrick and
Antofagasta.

And then below me--above that group and interfacing to me immediately was
a study manager, an experienced mining engineer. And then above me was
the technical committee.

Now, the technical committee was representatives of both Barrick and
Antofagasta, and the chairmanship of the technical committee alternated
between Barrick and Antofagasta. It was predominantly technical people, and
it included the Senior Vice President of capital projects for Barrick and for
Antofagasta.

So, there was a good, solid team below, capable in their divisions and in their
various specialties. And there was oversight above them and then above me
as well. ...

And then we had the Board, obviously, beyond that.?747

. The Tribunal does not consider it credible that a buyer would have had concerns regarding

“leadership failures at TCC’™* while being aware that the team, including Mr. Livesey,
was supervised by a technical committee comprising representatives of Antofagasta and
Barrick, who combined the experience of building and operating copper companies as
well as building and operating gold mines in various locations across the continents.

While the Tribunal is therefore not convinced by the general argument that Claimant did
not have the necessary expertise to conduct a feasibility study, including the relevant
plans to be made for construction and execution of the project, this does not yet exclude
the possibility of potentially justified criticisms on individual parts of the Feasibility
Study. The Tribunal will therefore turn to the specific criticisms raised by Respondent
and Mr. Owen with regard to the plans for the construction and execution of the project.

Mr. Owen criticizes, inter alia, that the cost spent on the Feasibility Study was too low
which, in his view, demonstrates that the level of engineering was not adequate. In his
opinion, the total amount spent on feasibility studies for “Mega Projects” is “normally”
3% to 5% of the total capital cost estimate.” Mr. Owen does not identify any source for
this statement. Claimant’s expert Mr. Cusworth, on the other hand, considers that the cost

for the studies conducted by Claimant, i.e., USD 81.37 million or 2.47% of the total
capital cost estimate, exceeded the industry benchmark, which he considered to be 1% to
2%." In support of his opinion, he refers to an excerpt from the AIMM Cost Estimation
Handbook, which identifies an expected range of study costs depending on the
complexity and/or size of the project. For a feasibility study, the Handbook identifies the
following percentages: low (1-2%); moderate (1.5-2.5%) and high (2.5-3.5%).”>!

The Tribunal notes that the range referred to by Mr. Cusworth in fact corresponds to the
percentages identified in the Handbook for projects of low size and/or complexity. In
addition, the number he relies on is presented in the Feasibility Study but in fact identifies
the cost for project expenditures on the studies since inception of the project in June 2006,
752 On the other hand, the Tribunal notes

that the same chart of the Feasibility Study identifies significant other cost items such as

i.e., including scoping and pre-feasibility studies.

“Resource Geology” which are listed separately and result in a total amount of project
expenditures from inception of USD 204,261, i.e., approximately 6.2% of the total capital
cost estimate. As for the total percentages of costs to be expected over the study stages,
the AIMM Cost Estimation Handbook gives an overall range of 1.3% to 6%.’
Consequently, while the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by the comparison drawn by
Mr. Cusworth, it appears that the expenditures made by Claimant would be well within
the range of expected costs even for a project of high complexity and/or size.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that the amount of cost spent cannot in and of itself be
evidence of whether the Feasibility Study included adequate plans for construction and
execution of the project. Mr. Owen states that the total expenditures should have been
higher because a “Mega Project’ requires a higher amount of upfront engineering and
development to execute than a “normal” project. In his opinion, “Mega Projects” should
have a substantial amount of basic engineering done in the feasibility study, which should
amount to at least 15% to 20% of the overall engineering.’** In this regard, the Tribunal
notes that Respondent’s allegation that at least 80% of the basic engineering and 15% of
the detailed engineering should be completed” and its criticism for lack of detailed
engineering in the Feasibility Study’ is not supported by Mr. Owen. To the contrary, he
confirmed in his presentation during the Hearing on Quantum that detailed engineering
starts only after the feasibility level:’°’

specifically identify which aspect of the basic engineering was not adequate in his
opinion. He states that basic engineering includes Process Flow Diagrams and Process &

further advanced than would be required to comply with normal practices at feasibility

not specify why or how they would not satisfy the level of basic engineering that he would
have expected in a feasibility study. He merely raises general criticisms that the level of
basic engineering was inadequate.

During the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Owen presented a list of components that should
be included in a project execution plan and took the view that a project execution plan
with these “key components does not exist.”"°? In response, Claimant has identified the
sections of the Feasibility Study, which address the components listed by Mr. Owen.
While Claimant makes reference to Chapter 22 on Project Execution for some of the
components, it also refers to various other Chapters, such as Chapter 20 on Operations,
Chapter 21 on Contracts, Procurement and Logistics, Chapter 10 on Information
Technology, Chapter 17 on Communications, Chapter 18 on Safety & Health and Chapter

659. The Tribunal understands Mr. Owen’s criticism to be, inter alia, that Claimant did not

have a single document entitled “Project Execution Plan”, which comprised all of the
elements he was looking for. As for the Chapter on Project Execution in the Feasibility
Study, Mr. Owen considers this to be “a boilerplate chapter ... on EPCM project
execution” and maintains that “a fully detailed and costed” Project Execution Plan would

have been required.”

However, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would have
expected to find all of the relevant information in one document rather than in the
Chapters of the Feasibility Study setting out the individual aspects of the project. More
specifically, neither Respondent nor Mr. Owen have pointed to any authority which
would support the suggestion that only a “Project Execution Plan” comprising the
elements listed by Mr. Owen in a single document would satisfy the level of basic

engineering or the level of accuracy that a buyer would expect in a feasibility study.

In this regard, the Tribunal takes note of the fact that Claimant’s expert Mr. Cusworth
identified a total of four “deltas” in respect of which the Feasibility Study, in his opinion,
“was not at best practice, but rather more in line with normal industry standards for a
feasibility study” and could have provided further detail. Specifically, he identified
funding arrangements which had been considered only on a preliminary basis, the
timetable contained in the Forward Work Plan, the transportation of large quantities of
freight to the site during construction and the strategy and timing of selecting the EPCM
contractor.’ In Mr. Cusworth’s opinion, these “deltas” did not, however, affect the
“bankable quality” of the Feasibility Study, which would have allowed Claimant and its
owners to make a well informed financial investment decision.”

Mr. Owen does not address these “deltas” and in particular does not present a different
opinion regarding their potential effect on the quality of the Feasibility Study. Therefore,
the Tribunal has no reason to assume that these would have affected the value of the
project from the perspective of a buyer.

Mr. Owen rather addresses a variety of different subjects, which in his opinion are not or
not adequately dealt with in the Feasibility Study. First, as to the question of the
construction and ramp-up schedule, the Tribunal notes that in his first report, Mr. Owen
criticized an “overly aggressive construction schedule” which he considered to be “at
least 10-12 months too aggressive.” In addition, he considered that Claimant took an
“unrealistic approach to its ramp up assumptions,” by assuming that ramp up would be

completed in three months, and opined that the average ramp up was 16 to 18 months,

with up to 24 months in “remote difficult locations."

In response, Mr. Cusworth assessed first the construction schedule and concluded based
on an analysis of the project and recent benchmarking that the construction period of 48
months put forward in the Feasibility Study was “readily achievable, and indeed even
more conservative than what has recently been achieved on similar mining projects.”"
Mr. Cusworth then examined the ramp-up time to be expected for Reko Diq based on a
normalized benchmarking of copper mine and concentrator projects over the past 40 years
and concluded that Reko Diq would have qualified as a “Category 1” style ramp up using
simple, mature methodology because it: (i) was “technically straight forward”; (ii) had
“high quality sponsors with relevant expertise”; (iii) had “with a degree of certainty a
continuous, consistent ore body”, and (iv) had SNC Lavalin as an experienced EPCM
contractor. On that basis, Mr. Cusworth presented a production forecast for Reko Diq
projecting that it would achieve its design capacity of throughput and recovery after 24
months of operations.”

On that basis, Prof. Davis decided in his second report to maintain the 48-month
construction schedule but to adjust his valuation model to reflect the ramp-up schedule
provided by Mr. Cusworth. This adjustment from the 3-month ramp up estimated in the
Feasibility Study to the ramp-up schedule presented by Mr. Cusworth reduced the value
of the project by USD 0.6 billion.”

In his second report, Mr. Owen questioned whether Mr. Cusworth was in a position to
give an independent opinion given his previous involvement with the project through his
firm, Enthalpy, and in particular his review of the Feasibility Study in 2011 in which he
did not point out the “improbable ramp-up time” of three months.’”! Mr. Owen did not,
however, raise any specific criticisms regarding Mr. Cusworth’s assessment and
benchmarking of the construction schedule in the Feasibility Study. In the absence of any
such criticism, the Tribunal sees no basis for a conclusion that a buyer would not have
considered the construction schedule contained in the Feasibility Study adequate.

In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Mr. Owen’s suggestion that Mr. Cusworth, by
providing an analysis on the ramp-up schedule in his expert report for this arbitration that
he apparently did not perform during his contemporaneous review of the Feasibility Study
in 2011, would not be in a good position to give an independent opinion on either aspect

of the project. During the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Cusworth testified that he “didn’t
look at that technical issue” during his three-day review of the Feasibility Study in 2011
and readily acknowledged that he “didn’t see it at the time [he] did the review in 2011.77
In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that Mr. Cusworth performed an additional analysis in
response to Mr. Owen’s criticisms and reached a different result for one aspect of the
project does not in itself raise any doubts as to the independence of his opinion.

As for Mr. Cusworth’s analysis on the ramp-up schedule, Mr. Owen questioned his
opinion that Reko Diq would qualify as a “class one” ramp up and noted that only 28%
of the projects “are truly class one startups, so the vast majority of startups will not be
class one.” Mr. Owen further considered that achieving a class one startup requires
“extensive experience in this specific task,” adding that in his opinion Antofagasta and
Barrick did not have the requisite experience because they had never worked in Pakistan
and were planning to use a “rather a new technology” for crushing the rock. He therefore
considered it more likely that Reko Diq would have a “normal 12 to 16 month startup”

in the “Series I or Series 2 range.”””

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Owen does not engage with the four reasons provided by Mr.
Cusworth in support of his opinion that Reko Diq would classify as a “Category 1” ramp
up. The Tribunal also cannot follow the rather general argument that Claimant’s owners
did not have the required expertise of building and operating a mine at Reko Dig. While
they may not have worked specifically in Pakistan, Barrick had built and was operating
mines in various remote locations across the continents and, therefore, more specific
arguments would be required to convince the Tribunal that the personnel from Barrick
did not bring the necessary expertise to develop a mine in Pakistan.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Owen himself does not specify what he means by
“Series 1 or Series 2 range” and, most importantly, considers that a ramp-up over 12 to
16 months would be “normal.” The Tribunal recalls that Mr. Cusworth’s production
forecast for Reko Diq assumes that the ramp-up would be completed after 24 months and
Prof. Davis incorporated this analysis into his valuation model. On that basis, the Tribunal
has no reason to believe that the adjusted ramp-up schedule include in Prof. Davis’ revised
model would not be considered adequate by a buyer.

Mr. Owen continued to emphasize during his presentation at the Hearing on Quantum
that Claimant had estimated a ramp-up of three months, which he considered “totally
unrealistic” and evidence of “the team’s lack of experience in leading projects in real
ramp-ups.”""* The Tribunal considers, however, that even on the assumption that a buyer

would have reached the same conclusion as Mr. Cusworth regarding a reasonable ramp-
up time, the buyer would presumably have done the same exercise as Prof. Davis, i-e., it
would have quantified the impact of making the necessary adjustments for what it
considered a reasonable ramp-up time and it would have deducted that amount from the
purchase price it would have been willing to pay. The Tribunal is not convinced that, as
Mr. Owen suggests, the buyer would have used this as a basis for questioning the expertise
of Claimant’s team or the validity of the Feasibility Study in general.

In his first expert report, Mr. Owen further criticized that the Feasibility Study did not use
productivity factors to evaluate its estimate of the man-hours required for the project and
explained that Claimant should have used the Gulf Coast Factor, which calculates
productivity as a multiple of the Gulf Coast Rate, i.e., a standard based on productivity in
the Gulf Coast area. Mr. Owen noted that he did not know what the Gulf Coast Factor
would be for Pakistan but considered that “4 is a minimum.” He added that he was not
able to calculate the factor due to the lack of a productivity analysis in the Feasibility
Study.7” As for the estimates from local contractors on which Claimant had relied, Mr.
Owen considered these “likely to be understated, and schedules based on those estimates
... not reliable.” Mr. Owen further criticized the lack of a productivity curve showing the
amount of work done over time as well as the absence of a benchmarking effort. In his
opinion, the Feasibility Study “recognizes this shortcoming” by stating that this will be
done during the engineering phase and puts into question the estimate’s reliability for
forecasting construction.””°

In response to this criticism, Mr. Cusworth provided several reasons why, in his opinion,
an application of the “Gulf Coast Rate” would have been “inappropriate” for Reko Diq:
(i) absence of reliable, relevant data on productivity for Pakistan; (ii) general unreliability
of data developed based on the Gulf Coast standard due to the absence of a specific
baseline to which appropriate factors can be applied and its high subjectivity; and (iii)
Claimant and SNC Lavalin’s use of a “detailed and rigorous plan to obtain accurate
estimates of the labour costs” which comprised obtaining a minimum of three bids from
local and international contractors for all major construction packages, preparing a bid
analysis and comparison against recent and ongoing projects in the region by SNC
Lavalin’s estimators who had experience with sourcing labor for construction projects in
Pakistan. Mr. Cusworth noted that it would be “unrealistic to expect that these in-house
benchmarks would be disclosed in a third party document such as the Reko Dig
Feasibility Study.”"”" In the opinion of Mr. Cusworth, the Feasibility Study “provided the
estimates of labour hours and costs in painstaking detail” and he pointed to estimates for

every item of the scope of work in the Appendices of the Feasibility Study and the curves
of labor hours and number of personnel required for construction. On that basis, Mr.
Cusworth concluded that “[t]his comprehensive methodology goes well beyond normal
practices at feasibility study stage and is a more accurate method than that suggested by
Mr. Owen.”778

Mr. Owen did not provide any substantive response to Mr. Cusworth’s opinion in his
second report. While acknowledging that Mr. Cusworth’s report “does touch on the issues
of labor productivity,” Mr. Owen did not address any of the reasons provided by Mr.
Cusworth in support of the methodology used by Claimant. He did not again refer to the
Gulf Coast rate but only generally criticized a “lack of details on productivity.””” The
Tribunal therefore agrees with Claimant that Mr. Owen appears to have abandoned his
specific criticism of not using the Gulf Coast Factor. In any event, the Tribunal finds Mr.
Cusworth’s explanation credible as to why it was more appropriate to rely on bids and
estimates from local and international contractors rather than the Gulf Coast Factor, in
particular taking into account the apparently undisputed absence of sufficient data for
Pakistan.

The Tribunal notes that Respondent points to Mr. Cusworth’s oral testimony at the
Hearing on Quantum that “[i]t’s very hard to get reliable productivity figures which you
can rely on. They can give you an indication, but you wouldn’t rely on them.”7°°
Respondent draws the conclusion that “[w]ith this level of uncertainty regarding the
productivity of any future work force, this Tribunal must side with Pakistan and conclude
that TCC did not have the detail available to reasonably estimate its ability to execute the

project”?!

The Tribunal considers it worth recalling Mr. Cusworth’s testimony on this point in more
detail. In response to the question whether the distinction between what “can be done”
and what “might be done” also applies to the productivity of employees, Mr. Cusworth
responded as follows:
“A. I think so, yeah. Well, let's put it this way: I couldn't see that. What I could
see was a good training program, a good site culture, in terms of ensuring
productivity was the best that could be done in the circumstance. I didn't see
details of people doing very detailed evaluations of a particular contractor
doing this piece of work, achieving this productivity. These projects, they're
special.

Q. Because these projects are special, is it difficult to predict how productive
laborers might be?

A. In countries where it's--and locations that are unique, the answer is yes.
It's very hard to get reliable productivity figures which you can rely on. They
can give you an indication, but you wouldn't rely on them.

Q. Would you have considered Pakistan to be a unique location, like the one
you just referenced in your prior answer?

A. I would say so, yes. In the location, I think in around the major cities and
ports, there would be a lot more capability, mainly related to infrastructure;
so roads and things like that. And there's roads on Reko Diq. But putting in
crushes and mills, the answer is, they've got some cement industries where
there might be capability there, but as far as a single copper project put in
this area, they have limited experience.

Q. With that limited experience, would it have made it harder to keep the
Project on schedule?

A. No. Possibly the other way around. The reason is that the resources are
readily available. The ability to bring people in and throw them at a
bottleneck in construction would be very high; whereas, in Australia or North
America, getting the people and getting them onto the job can be a lot more
difficult.

So, I would say there is some advantages.

Q. Even though the people you would be bringing in would not have any
experience in large-scale copper mining; right?

A. If you're looking for a good carpenter's assistant, it doesn't matter.
Someone putting up scaffolding or that sort of thing doesn't matter. Someone
doing an instrumentation and control system for a copper project, there may
be very limited supply in Pakistan, but there is good supply worldwide.”"**

676. Based on the evidence in the record, including Mr. Cusworth’s oral testimony, the
Tribunal cannot follow Respondent’s conclusion that Claimant was not able to prepare a
reasonable estimate of the productivity of its workforce. While Mr. Cusworth indeed
confirmed that it is hard to get reliable productivity figures for a place such as Reko Diq,
he did not agree with Respondent that Reko Digq’s location would have made it harder for
the project to stay on schedule. In addition, Mr. Cusworth explained that Claimant did
“the best that could be done in the circumstance” in terms of ensuring productivity and
the Tribunal has not been provided with any specific argument from either Respondent
or Mr. Owen as to why it should doubt that testimony. Consequently, the Tribunal has no
reason to believe that a buyer would have taken a different view and/or that it would have
considered the productivity estimates prepared based on the methodology explained by
Mr. Cusworth inadequate.

Canada had been USD 25,000 per ton of capacity and considered a premium of 20% for
Reko Dig “low considering the location, potential manpower issues, security, and general
construction costs.”7*? Mr. Owen did not provide any support for his opinion that a cost
estimate corresponding to USD 30,000 per ton of installed capacity is too low.

Mr. Cusworth noted in his expert report that the Feasibility Study presents a
benchmarking of capital costs of 16 “sufficiently similar” projects, which showed that
Reko Dig was slightly above the average cost rate but “reasonably comparable in cost to

similar sized remote projects” :™*

estimate presented by Claimant was generally too low.

In his first report, Mr. Owen further raised the following specific criticisms: (i) pipeline
cost estimate over 50% estimated from other jobs rather than qualified contractors; (ii) no
CAPEX or OPEX assigned to several high risk items in the Residual Risk Assessment,
specifically regarding the pipeline; (iii) no true line item for the Reverse Osmosis plant;

(iv) labor estimates (which have already been addressed above); and (v) an 11% cost
contingency, which Mr. Owen considered to be “unrealistic” and below the expected 15
to 20%.785

681.

In response to the criticism under (iii), Mr. Cusworth pointed out that, contrary to Mr.
Owen’s suggestion, the capital cost for the Reverse Osmosis plant (or rather both
contemplated water treatment plants) is included in Appendix 10.5 of the Feasibility
Study.’8° Mr. Owen did not again refer to this point in his second report and the Tribunal
therefore considers this criticism moot.

682. As for the criticism under (i), Mr. Cusworth noted that the feasibility of the pipeline had
been assessed in a thorough 600-page report prepared by experts at slurry pipelines (PSI)
and considered that the level of detail in this report is “greater than one would normally
expect in a Feasibility Study.” Mr. Cusworth therefore expressed “a high level of
confidence in the definition of the pipeline, the estimates of the costs associated with

sourcing the materials of the construction, and associated works.”7*"

683. In response, Mr. Owen maintained that “pipeline security remains a concern’”™*® but did
not again refer to his previous criticism that Claimant’s cost estimate was not based on
estimates of qualified contractors. The Tribunal notes that the aspect of pipeline security
has been addressed in detail by the Parties’ security experts and will form subject of a
separate analysis on security aspects of the project below. Therefore, the Tribunal will
not address this criticism in any further detail at this point.

684. As for the criticism under (v) regarding the 11% cost contingency, Mr. Cusworth
explained that the amount of contingency, i.e., the judgment of the costs of “Known
Unknowns” in an estimate, varies according to the degree of engineering design definition
achieved and pointed to the varying amounts of contingency applied in the Feasibility
Study for different components of the project, ranging from 5% for mining equipment to
be sourced from existing fixed-price global contracts with suppliers to up to 25% for
piping. In particular, Mr. Cusworth noted that the contingency for labor and pipeline
material, i.e., 20%, was in line with what Mr. Owen had required and was, in Mr.

Cusworth’s opinion, “higher than necessary."

685. In his second report, Mr. Owen maintained that the project should have a higher
contingency “due to its size, complexity, location and risks.” He acknowledged the “basic
feasibility contingency calculation” in the Feasibility Study but considered that “this is

assessment, and then use a company like ARES Risk Management ... to conduct a
statistical analysis utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation that provides significantly more
confidence as to what the schedule timeline should be and the total cost of the project
should not exceed.””°® Mr. Owen explained that this exercise would provide the owner
with a contingency value providing a 80-90% confidence that the project should not
exceed that value. According to Mr. Owen, Claimant did not fully engage in this exercise
but was driven by “Project Advocates” trying to minimize the contingency in order to get
board approval for the project. He then noted that the Feasibility Study actually includes
a supplemental calculation of what an 85% confidence factor would add to the project,
i.e., a “contingency of 105 million USD for Capex cost overruns,” but emphasized that
the number was not included in the CAPEX.””!

Specifically, Mr. Owen referred to the following statement in the Feasibility Study:

“A residual risk value of $105 000 000 has been identified, and it is
recommended that TCC carry the costs as part of owner’s costs. Details of
the risks and calculations are provided in Section 30, Risk. The residual value
has been recommended, but is not included in the CAPEX or Sustaining
Capital.””*

In Chapter 30 of the Feasibility Study, the section on “Residual Risk’ states, inter alia,
the following:

“Based on the results of the risk review held in Toronto on October 6 and 7,
2009 the Reko Dig Project is considered to be a well thought out and low
financial risk project. A review of the risk register contained in Appendix 20
will show that the major challenges for the project reside in the areas of
Security, Community Relations and Human Resources.

The residual risk for the project CAPEX has been calculated taking into
account all of the threats identified and reviewed during this phase and the
PFS using a statistical Monte Carlo approach. It is recommended that a risk
allowance of $105 M be added to the IMD estimate to account for risk which
may materialize between now and commissioning. This compares very
favourably with the figure of $135 M which was recommended following at
the end of the PFS.”

. Appendix 20.01 containing the “Residual Risk Assessment” presents in the section on

“Capex Residual Risk’ a figure comprising “the distributions of all Monte Carlo
outcomes” as well as a figure representing “the risk allowance required for any desired

689. Finally, Appendix 20.01 recommends “that a Risk Allowance of $105M be added to the

Capex estimate, which will give an 85% probability of not exceeding the budget.”"*

690. The Tribunal notes that, as specifically stated in Chapter 30 and Appendix 20.01, “[t]he
residual risk for the project Capex has been calculated taking into account all of the
threats identified and reviewed during this phase and the Pre-Feasibility study using a
statistical Monte Carlo approach””> and thus in line with what Mr. Owen considered to
be the “critical component” of a contingency calculation. However, as pointed out by Mr.
Owen, Chapter 23 states that the residual risk value of USD 105 million was
“recommended, but is not included in the CAPEX or sustaining capital.””°

691. Claimant argues that the residual risk value is not a missing contingency but rather a
measure of the Project’s sensitivity to capital cost overruns.’”’ In any event, Claimant
submits that “this residual risk value of US$ 105 million was derived from the same Risk
Register that Prof. Davis fed into his model. Prof: Davis, however, made even more
conservative assumptions about those risks than those made by the TCC team at the time
of the Feasibility Study and then incorporated those more conservative assumptions into
the valuation he has presented. Thus, even if Pakistan could establish that TCC’s work
was inadequate, which it cannot, this could not possibly have any effect on the valuation
presented by TCCA.”78

692. Mr. Cusworth testified at the Hearing on Quantum that the USD 105 million does not
form part of the Capex or sustaining capital but “will be in the supplemental overrun
facility that the companies will approve on the investment decision point.” He confirmed
that the decision about whether or not to assume the risk of this USD 105 million would
be made at the investment decision point: “Correct, which is standard practice if you go
to BHP or Rio or any of the big mining companies. This is the way they handle these sorts

of things in their investment decisions.”"”?

separately at the point of making the investment decision is not decisive at this point. In
any event, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that a buyer would have
considered the calculation of the residual risk value relevant and would have factored it
into its calculation of the purchase price it would have been willing to pay.

The Tribunal understands both from Claimant’s submission and from Prof. Davis’
explanations in his second report that he did not directly include the USD 105 million
residual risk value in his valuation model. Rather, he looked at the risks in the risk register
on which the calculation of the residual risk value was based, formed his own assumptions
as to the appropriate adjustments for these risks and then included these assumptions in
his valuation model.

Prof. Davis noted in his second report that the 11% contingency presented in the
Feasibility Study was intended to account only for “items which are included in the scope
of work, but which cannot be adequately defined at this time due to lack of accurate
detailed design information.” It was “not intended to cover such items as labour disputes,
changes in scope or price escalation.”®® In Prof. Davis’ opinion, the 15-20% contingency
that Mr. Owen would have considered adequate is therefore not comparable to the 11%
figure. In any event, he noted that Mr. Owen did not address Prof. Davis’ estimate of
capital costs, “which reflects substantial additional adjustments relative to the numbers
in the feasibility study for cost escalation and delays.”*°! Prof. Davis explained that while
feasibility studies typically estimate capital costs without allowance for future cost
increases, all of the potential causes of cost overruns (including inflation caused by
delays) are reflected in his model, resulting in a capital cost estimate which is 58% higher
than in the Feasibility Study and therefore well above the figures that Mr. Owen as well
as Respondent’s valuation experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered
necessary.*°? Specifically with regard to the cost increases he estimated in order to
account for risks identified in Claimant’s residual risk register, Prof. Davis explained:

“T further increased capital costs to account for asymmetric risks evaluated

by TCC in its residual risk register that, if realized, would result in cost

overruns relative to those initial estimates. My research, which Mr.

Brailovsky and Professor Wells cite, shows that the effect of these risk factors

on cost overruns is typically small for large projects, and this is the case here.

A possible explanation for this is that large projects are more flexible, making

it easier for managers to take mitigating actions to control budgets and

overruns. Large projects are also more subject to scrutiny. Certainly, TCC’s

residual risk analysis is consistent with this: Reko Dig is a large project which

was subjected to extensive engineering work and scrutiny. Therefore, I would
not expect significant overruns arising from residual risks and due to
imprecision in capital cost estimates.”*°?

696. The Tribunal notes that, as pointed out by Prof. Davis, neither Mr. Owen nor Mr.

698.

Brailovsky and Prof. Wells raised specific criticisms regarding the adjustments made by
Prof. Davis to the capital cost estimate of the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study. In particular, they did not raise the allegation that either the 11%
contingency or the residual risk value of USD 105 million would not be adequately
reflected in the 58% capital cost increase included by Prof. Davis in his valuation model.
In the absence of any specific criticism regarding the contingency and residual risk value
accounted for by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal sees no basis for a finding that Prof. Davis has
not sufficiently accounted for them in his valuation.

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Owen also suggests that the Monte Carlo simulation was not
done properly and that a “better developed” risk assessment would have resulted in a
higher amount than USD 105 million.*°* However, in light of the fact that the Feasibility
Study does make reference to “using a statistical Monte Carlo approach,”* the Tribunal
considers that a more specific explanation would have been necessary in order to cast into
doubt the adequacy of the methodology used by Claimant and SNC Lavalin in the residual
risk assessment. In any event, the fact remains that Mr. Owen did not express any opinion
on the additional risk adjustments included by Prof. Davis in the valuation that forms the
basis for the claim raised by Claimant in this arbitration.

Finally, Mr. Owen raised as criticism (ii) that the residual risk register included risks to
which Claimant had assigned no CAPEX or OPEX impact, in particular with regard to
the pipeline. Mr. Cusworth responded to this criticism by pointing out that out of seven
identified risks relating to the pipeline, there were only four such items without an
assigned CAPEX or OPEX impact and considered that these “would not have any
quantifiable financial impact on the project” as they relate to either community or health
and safety where financial impact is either difficult to quantify (reputational damage) or
financially insignificant. He therefore concluded that “the treatment of risk has been
addressed in accordance with good practice across the project, particularly for the
pipeline.”®®° Tn addition, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Davis analyzed each of the
previously unquantified risks and either placed them in one of the three risk categories he
identified for his valuation or rated them as “not material.”*°’ This approach will be
discussed in further detail in the Tribunal’s assessment of whether it is convinced that

Prof. Davis has adequately accounted for all risks affecting the project in his valuation
model. At this point, it suffices to note that Mr. Owen again did not address the
adjustments for risk made by Prof. Davis but only focused on the Feasibility Study.
Consequently, even if his criticism were accurate and Claimant inadequately failed to
assign an impact to these risks, the Tribunal still has no basis for a finding that Prof. Davis
inadequately accounted for these risks.

As a final note, the Tribunal has taken note of Mr. Owen’s repeated argument that the
project was pushed forward by “Project Advocates” who were trying to get board
approval by including unrealistic assumptions in the Feasibility Study.*°* During the
Hearing, Mr. Owen also used the expression that Claimant and its owners did not have
their “eye on the ball” because “SNC [Lavalin] was running this whole show.”® The
Tribunal is not convinced by either of these arguments but in fact considers them
contradicted, inter alia, by Respondent’s own submissions. As noted at the beginning of
this section, Respondent specifically recognized that Claimant had “full teams from both
owners” working on and supervising the Feasibility Study.”*!° Mr. Owen noted that “it
normally requires 10-12 people to prepare a feasibility stud. The IMD FS had 23 people
from TCC, showing that Barrick and Antofagasta each wanted their own pair of eyes on
everything.”*!! Mr. Livesey also testified as to the structure subject to whose supervision
the Feasibility Study was prepared.

In the Tribunal’s view, Barrick and Antofagasta’s attention to the Feasibility Study
appears entirely reasonable given the large amounts of equity that Barrick and
Antofagasta were planning to invest in the project. At the same time, the Tribunal does
not find it credible that these “full teams’ comprised only what Mr. Owen referred to as
“Project Advocates,” who were allegedly willing to ignore substantial risks in order to
get the project approved. The Tribunal also notes that, in addition to Claimant and its
owners, the Feasibility Study was reviewed by numerous third-party consultants, several
of which have appeared as experts before this Tribunal and, as will be set out in more
detail below, have provided convincing explanations on individual aspects of the project
that were criticized by Respondent and its experts.

The Tribunal therefore cannot follow Mr. Owen’s argument but wishes to emphasize that
its impression is quite to the contrary, i.e., that Barrick and Antofagasta were significantly
involved in the preparation of the Feasibility Study and had every interest to prepare a
thorough Feasibility Study including plans on project execution and appropriate cost
estimates accouting for the relevant risks affecting the project. Also taking into account

that Prof. Davis made additional risk adjustments in his valuation model which were not
criticized by Mr. Owen, the Tribunal concludes that it has no reason to believe that
Claimant’s plans for executing the project and the capital cost estimate, as adjusted by
Prof. Davis, would have been considered inadequate by a buyer in November 2011.

Whether Claimant Has Established That It Had a Feasible Plan for the Supply of
Water to the Project

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that Respondent’s arguments on water ignore the Tribunal’s findings
in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that “Claimant did make a full feasibility
assessment of the groundwater source that it intended to use for the project” and that its
alleged failure to do so did “not present a justifiable basis for denying TCCP’s Mining

Lease Application.”*!

According to Claimant, Respondent relies on a single phrase in the executive summary
of the 2007 Scoping Study Report observing that the improper or incomplete
identification of a water supply can become a “kill point” for a mining project. Claimant
maintains, however, that after the Scoping Study, it performed “an enormous amount of
work to satisfy itself that it had sufficient water for the project” and to eliminate the risk
that existed in 2007.*'? Claimant refers to its expert Mr. Mayer, Barrick’s senior
hydrogeologist during the relevant time period, who testified that Claimant and its owners
were “confident that TCC could supply enough water to sustain mining at Reko Diq’ for
the life of the mine. In this regard, Claimant notes that it had identified: (i) an aquifer that
was “not only an abundant source of water but which could be utilized without any
significant effect on surrounding communities’, (ii) three backup sources; and (iii) the

possibility to build a sea water pipeline.*!*

Claimant further claims that any residual risk that remained as of November 2011 has
been accounted for by Prof. Davis and refers in particular to the following risks: (i) “Draw
down of water by others leaves insufficient water for project needs’, (ii) production
interruptions and/or additional expenses caused by the available water resource being
“insufficient to supply operating requirements’; (iii) water usage at one of the alternative
sources “causes drawdowns that impact locals . . . resulting in negative perceptions re.

the project and additional compensation costs”; and (iv) a lender would require Claimant

to engage in cross border consultation with either Afghanistan or Iran.*!5

Claimant submits that its assessment of the groundwater sources in the Feasibility Study
drew on the experience of hydrologists employed by both owners, such as Mr. Mayer, as
well as several outside consultants, such as Dr. Drury of SMEC and Mr. Jones of John
Shomaker and Associates, Inc. (JSAI), who prepared numerous reports several of which
were appended to the Feasibility Study and have appeared as experts in this arbitration.*!°

Claimant explains that while it initially investigated eight potential water sources, it

 

narrowed them down to four in the Pre-Feasibility water study and ultimately decided to
focus on one primary source, i.e., the Fan Sediments, because the water is brackish, not
potable, not suitable for irrigation and not even suitable for making cement without
treatment, which would have rendered Claimant to be “virtually the only entity pumping
water from this source” and outweighed “less favorable characteristics, such as the high
mineral content and the distance from the site.” At the same time, Claimant notes that it
continued to perform feasibility-level studies for the three alternative water sources all of

which were confirmed by SMEC to be viable options to supplement the Fan Sediments.*!”

Claimant submits that in order to obtain information about the extent of the Fan Sediments
as well as its capacity to store and release groundwater, SMEC performed a 21-day
pumping test during which it extracted a total of 200,000 cubic meters of water, which
corresponds to 4% of the water demand for the construction phase. According to
Claimant, this test exceeded typical pump-out tests which usually take place over three to
seven days and allowed SMEC to sufficiently stress the system to test for any barriers to
the flow of water and to monitor the groundwater-level decline as well as its recovery to
the previous level after the pump-out, which was completed within 21 days.*'* Claimant
explains that based on the data obtained during this pump-out test, JSAI developed a
groundwater flow model, which created a detailed reconstruction of the Fan Sediments
and aimed at predicting the behavior of the aquifer over the life of the mine, showing that
there was sufficient water to meet the demands of the project, including in the expansion
scenario. Claimant further notes that both the JSAI model and the SMEC Water Resource
Assessment were subject to peer review by Mr. Mayer and independent consultants from
Douglas Partners who concluded that “[g]roundwater investigations outlined in SMEC
(2009) are comprehensive and have been undertaken to a high standard” and that” [t]he

conclusions and recommendations outlined therein are reasonable and can be

707. Claimant rejects the criticisms raised by Respondent regarding SMEC’s drilling and
pump-out tests and refers to the explanations provided by Dr. Drury regarding the team’s
equipment and experience as well as certain problems noted by SMEC, which are typical
for drilling projects and did not affect the final results.'?? Claimant also refers to Dr.
Drury’s explanation regarding the depth of the drilling, which covered the extent by
which the water level would be lowered pursuant to the JSAI model, and SMEC’s
additional reliance on a geophysical survey which allowed it to make a reasonable
estimate regarding the aquifer’s geology.**! Claimant further rejects the argument that the
boreholes drilled by SMEC did not provide the yield required for Reko Diq and argues
that pumping efficiency would have increased significantly by using more efficient
pumps and fully “screening” the borehole.*” Finally, Claimant acknowledges that SMEC
noted in its Water Resources Assessment that it was not able to perform test work across
the border in Afghanistan but emphasizes that SMEC was able to obtain relevant
information from a geological survey as well as satellite images.*?? Claimant concludes
that while it would have continued to monitor and study the Fan Sediments, it had “more
than enough information to make an informed investment decision”, and refers to Mr.
Mayer who stated in his expert report:

“SMEC has identified a small number of additional studies and monitoring to
add to the understanding of the Fan Sediments aquifer and to optimize the
production bore-field design. The practice of providing this type of advice is
common and consistent with other studies I have completed. Additional
information is always helpful, but there is a threshold at which a water study
becomes sufficient to make a feasibility determination. Our studies were more
than adequate to meet that threshold. We had contracted with experts at the
top of their field, conducted rigorous pump-out tests, and studied multiple
groundwater sources over a period of three years.”**+

708. Claimant further rejects the contention raised by Respondent and its experts Prof.
Dagdelen and Mr. Owen regarding the project’s water needs based on a “standard rate”
of one cubic meter of water per one tonne of material being processed. Claimant notes
that they do not cite any authority for this “standard rate” and ignore the fact that
Claimant had designed a “highly efficient metallurgical process where a large amount of

water from the tailings slurry would be recovered and returned for use in the process
plant.”*> Claimant refers to the explanations provided by Mr. Mayer regarding the
contemplated process as well as the amount of water used for the flotation process and
the transportation of slurry to Port Gwadar. It also quotes his testimony that “Pakistan’s
recommended approach would unnecessarily increase capital and operating costs for
water and tailings management, and would be irresponsible socially and
environmentally. Designing a plant with Pakistan’s proposed level of water demand
would result in an immense waste of water and of other resources used for flotation and
tailings processing. ... Some mines took this approach prior to the incorporation of
thickeners and efficient tailings management practices. I am not aware of any modern

mines that operate in this fashion.”*?°

Claimant also rejects the allegation that it made an error in the calculation of the “storage
coefficient.” Quoting from Mr. Jones, Claimant first emphasizes that storage coefficents
“describe short-term water-level changes in response to pumping, but they have nothing
to do with the volume of water in storage.”**’ Claimant explains that its consultants
therefore did not use storage coefficients to calculate the volume of water contained in
the Fan Sediments, which is actually reflected in the “porosity” of the different types of
dirt which are well known from hydrogeological research. Claimant submits that while
sand and gravel have a porosity of 30%, SMEC conservatively assumed a porosity of
20% to account for the fact that the Fan Sediments also contain silty clays.*** Claimant
also emphasizes that it did not rely on SMEC’s “rough estimate” of the total volume of
water but rather on the detailed groundwater model incorporating the entire available data
from surveys and the pump-out test. By contrast, Claimant notes that the storage
coefficients obtained during the pump-out test, while being consistent with a short-term
pumping from a confined aquifer layer, did not show the amount of water that can be
extracted during long-term pumping of a complex aquifer system.*”?

Claimant also rejects Respondent’s criticisms regarding the modeling of the size and
shape of the Fan Sediments created by JSAI. Claimant refers to the explanations provided
by its experts Dr. Drury and Mr. Jones as to how they determined that: (i) the ground
water flows in northeastern direction from the Iranian side of the border across Pakistan
towards the Afghanistan side of the border and there is in any event no impact on the
Iranian hydrogeological systems;**° (ii) the estimated amount of recharge of the aquifer

is based on rainfall occurring in the form of large torrential storms generating large
surface water runoffs flowing into the Fan Sediments, as confirmed by Balochistan in its
own Feasibility Study of the Fan Sediments in 2012, and the average annual rainfall
estimated by JSAI is adequate for the elevation of the relevant site;**! (iii) there is no
evidence that climate change would negatively affect Claimant’s ability to obtain water
but, to the contrary, increased temperatures would likely increase the energy available to
generate large storms;**? and (iv) the model uses time-variant calibration based on data
from the pump-out tests as set out in JSAI’s final report and SMEC’s 2010 Water
Resources Assessment.**3

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant contends that “[a]// four hydrogeological experts
agreed that the Fan Sediments would have supplied sufficient water for the operation of
the mine” and refers in particular to the oral testimony of Respondent’s expert Mr. Neville
who stated that he had “no doubt that the volume of water they need is there in the
sediments” and added that Claimant had “certainly done a good way of showing that.”**+
Claimant further quotes from: (i) its expert Dr. Drury who testified that the Fan Sediments
aquifer “is very extensive” and could “supply a sustainable groundwater supply to [the]
Reko Dig mine”; (ii) its expert Mr. Jones who explained that Claimant’s pumping would
have reduced the saturated thickness of the aquifer by “only a small fraction of [its] total
saturated thickness” and that it was therefore “obvious” that there was “water available
for the Project” in the Fan Sediments; and (iii) its expert Mr. Mayer who explained that
“the volume of water the project needs to extract is very small compared to the amount

of water available” and concluded that “there’s plenty of water supply for the project.”**°

In Claimant’s view, the only remaining issue in dispute between the Parties’ experts is
therefore the extent of any drawdown across the Afghan border that would result from
the pumping of water from the Fan Sediments. More specifically, Claimant notes that the
different projections of the Parties’ experts result from the different “specific yields” they
assumed. Claimant agrees with Mr. Neville that the specific yield is the “ratio of the
volume of water released to the volume of the porous medium” in an unconfined
aquifer.**° Claimant notes that Mr. Jones’ model on which the Feasibility Study is based

assumed a specific yield of 0.15 and results, in both the expansion and the non-expansion
scenarios, in a predicted drawdown at the Afghan border of 3 meters and a maximum
drawdown of 5 meters that would occur “about 20 to 30 years after the end of mining.”**"
According to Claimant, the accuracy of Mr. Jones’ calculation when using a 0.15 specific

yield was confirmed by Mr. Neville in his expert report.***

As for Mr. Neville’s application of a specific yield of 0.02, which results in a 3-meter
drawndown contour extending more than 25 kilometers into Afghanistan and a 10-meter
drawdown contour extending about 5 kilometers into Afghanistan, Claimant considers it
conceded by Mr. Neville that he had applied this specific yield in order to “exaggerate
what [the impacts] might be” and that “if we’re going to be wrong, we should be wrong
on the side of caution.”*° In Claimant’s view, the specific yield of 0.02 for clay is
“grossly exaggerated” because: (i) the Fan Sediments are not entirely composed of clay
but there are significant layers of sand and gravel which have a specific yield that is 6 to
20 times higher than that assumed by Mr. Neville; (ii) there is no continuous plate of clay
but rather separate clay lenses interspersed with much coarser sediments of sand and
gravel within which the water would cave moved vertically past the clay lenses; and (iii)
the clay lenses would have drained more slowly than the sand and gravel sediments but
they would have drained eventually and at a faster rate than assumed by Mr. Neville
because over the long term, the specific yield of clay can vary significantly and be up to
0.18.84

Claimant therefore maintains that the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones is more
accurate and was selected based on his review of the gamma logs and on-site review of
the drilling cores. According to Claimant, the projected impact of the drawdown across
the Afghan border would therefore have been “minimal and occurred only decades after
the start of the project.”**' Claimant also notes that there would not have been any
drawdown in Iran due to the direction of the ground water flow and satellite imagery
showing that users in Iran use water supplied by a different water source.*4”

In any event, Claimant rejects the submission that any such drawdown across the Afghan
border would have halted or delayed the Reko Dig project due to an obligation of Pakistan
to notify Afghanistan under the UN Watercourses Convention. Claimant notes that
Afghanistan and Pakistan are not party to the UN Watercourses Convention and argues

that its principles do not bind the countries as customary international law as
demonstrated by the lack of evidence that Pakistan has ever provided Afghanistan with a
notification of any project utilizing a shared watercourse. Claimant further argues that
Pakistan has also not provided any evidence of giving such notification to Iran with regard
to the Saindak mine even though the project has lowered the water level by at least 6.5
meters over the last 15 years and, by contrast to the water from the Fan Sediments, the
water there is potable and supplies water to a large number of farm users in Iran.*4*

According to Claimant, the use of the Fan Sediments for the Reko Diq project would in
any event be equitable and reasonable in the sense of Article 6 of the UN Watercourse
Convention and not cause any harm to Afghanistan given that there are “virtually no users
in the area” and the brackish water is not potable and cannot be used for animals or
irrigation. By contrast, Claimant argues that the socio-economic advantages for Pakistan
would have been “overwhelming” given that the Reko Diq project would have created
“thousands of direct and indirect jobs and made significant contributions to the finances
of Pakistan and Balochistan.”*** As the water is not fit for human consumption or
agriculture and the Fan Sediments are located in an isolated area with no competing users,
Claimant also considers that there is no basis for the argument that there would be
significant local opposition to its use of the aquifer.*4°

In addition, Claimant claims that even if significant harm had been created by using the
Fan Sediments, such harm could have been avoided or at least “significantly mitigated”
by monitoring the groundwater levels at the Fan Sediments and, if the decrease
approached the Afghan border, developing a mitigation system such as aquifer injections.
According to Claimant, there would have been “ample time” to develop such a mitigation
system as the drawdown would have occurred only “many years” after the start of
operations of the mine. Claimant refers to Mr. Drury who testified that aquifer injections
are regularly used and generally successful, provided that the system is properly

maintained, and estimated that the costs would be “in the tens of millions.”**°

Claimant further submits that in order to avoid or mitigate harm and “although more
costly than a water injection system,” it could also have used water from one of the other
three water sources that had been tested to feasibility level or, in the alternative, pumped
seawater from Port Gwadar to the mine.**” Claimant rejects the allegation that it did not
fully test the alternative water sources and refers to Dr. Drury’s explanations regarding

the tests performed by SMEC on each of these alternative sources.*“* Claimant also refers
to Mr. Mayer’s testimony regarding the option to build a seawater pipeline, which has
become more common in Chile and which was costed as an option early in Reko Diq’s

development.**”

Finally, Claimant notes that it is undisputed that under the UN Watercourse Convention,
Afghanistan would not have had the right to veto or otherwise derail the project and refers

to Dr. Nanni, who confirmed that “[t]here is no veto power in international law.”**°

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

Respondent submits that “[w]ater was a big concern for TCC” and was identified in the
Risk Assessment Report prepared by Behre Dolbear in October 2007 as the “most
critical” limitation of the project. Respondent emphasizes that the quantities of water
needed for the construction and operation of the project would be equal to the level of
daily water consumption of approximately 500,000 people and thus significantly exceed
the quantities needed by other mining projects in the region, including Saindak.**!
Respondent also points to the additional risks identified in Claimant’s Risk Register,
which confirms in its view that Claimant was aware that “the availability of and right to

use water could doom the entire project.”**?

According to Respondent, Claimant “fell far short of proving the size of the aquifer, its
plans for mitigation, and the effects of its plans on surrounding areas and countries.”
Specifically, Respondent contends that Claimant’s expert Dr. Drury acknowledged
during his cross-examination that the Fan Sediments would most likely not have provided
enough water for Reko Diq.*°* Respondent also points out that SMEC identified “key
issues” that needed to be further addressed in developing the Fan Sediments, such as the
water level drawdown across the Afghan border, the tribal No-Objection Certificates (the
“NOC’”) and the depth to bedrock at the Afghan border, and called for additional studies,
warning that the “hydrogeological assessment of the Fan Sediments Aquifer needs to be
treated with caution.”*** Respondent alleges that Claimant, however, abandoned many of
SMEC’s recommendations and pursued the development of the Fan Sediments even

though they had ranked only third in Dr. Drury’s assessment as they were further away
from Reko Dig and less economically efficient than the other two water sources.**>

Respondent maintains that Claimant failed to confirm the viability of the Fan Sediments
aquifer. It emphasizes that “Pakistan is not taking issue with the tests done but rather the
interpretation of the results.”**° In Respondent’s view, SMEC committed “basic errors
in analyzing their own samples,” which instead show that there was “far from sufficient
water, even for construction.” According to Respondent, SMEC: (i) miscalculated and
failed to actually test the available recharge as there is in fact little to no recharge to
surface and groundwater sources in the region, with climate change exacerbating water
scarcity; (ii) came up with the wrong size and shape of the aquifer because it did not drill
to the required depths to identify the boundaries of the aquifer and failed to carry out a
time-variant calibration; (iii) doubled the output of the aquifer; and (iv) ignored the
transnational impacts of draining an aquifer shared by Afghanistan and Iran, inter alia, by
assuming an incorrect water flow ignoring that the Fan Sediments extend into Iran and
Afghanistan.*°7

Respondent submits that the boreholes drilled by SMEC revealed a storage coefficient
ranging from .0002 to .0006, which it considers “reasonable” for a dry desert area with
no visible groundwater. According to Respondent, however, SMEC then applied a storage
coefficient of .2 when calculating the entirey of the Fan Sediments as if they were located
besides a large river. Respondent claims that when applying the correct storage
coefficient, “the size of the aquifer drops dramatically, showing there is roughly enough
water to merely construct the mine, only if TCC had drained the entire aquifer.” In
Respondent’s view, this error, as a result of which the amount of water was deficient by
a factor of 100, would have been “obvious” to any buyer or financier.***

Respondent also contends that none of the boreholes drilled provided the yield of liters
per second required during construction or operation of the mine.**? In response to
Claimant’s reference to the 21-day pump-out test conducted by SMEC, Respondent refers
to its expert Mr. Neville who testified that the test only demonstrated that “three wells
within the study area [could] be pumped for 21 days at a cumulative rate of 70-liters-per-
second,” i.e., afraction of Claimant’s overall water demand, which was over 10,000 times
higher over the life of the mine, and of the pumping rate, which was to be 20 times higher
during the operations of the mine. Respondent therefore contends that “[g]iven these
differences, TCC could not possibly have predicted the aquifer’s viability after such a

cursory test.” In its view, “[t]he inadequacy of these tests is apparent” when considering

the scale of the plans in the Feasibility Study.*

Respondent argues that the 21-day test might have been sufficient “in a simpler setting
with different materials” but Claimant’s experts admitted that in this case the test failed
to identify the aquifer’s specific yield and therefore required Mr. Jones to guess a key
parameter in his model, leading him to create a “one-sided and overly optimistic
projection of the water supply.” In addition, Respondent claims that Mr. Jones incorrectly
assumed that the aquifer was unconfined and thereby assumed that much more water was
available for extraction, arbitrarily reducing the projected impact on the groundwater

(0,861

levels by a factor of 1,00 Quoting from its expert Mr. Neville, Respondent contends

that in the absence of sufficient data provided by the pump-out tests, “the results of the

Shomaker (2009) groundwater model are speculative.”*

Respondent points out that SMEC’s conclusion based on these tests was only that “/ong-
term extraction of large volumes of water may be possible” and that “the Fan Sediments
may be a reasonable option to consider for water supply to Reko Dig,” but that more
information was needed. Pointing to SMEC’s statement that “[c]ontinuous pumping ...
during the three years construction phase will add substantial information about the
sustainability of this aquifer system,” Respondent takes the position that obtaining
sufficient information only halfway through construction was “deeply inadequate.”*® In
Respondent’s view, the Feasibility Study also does not affirmatively state that the Fan
Sediments could sustain the necessary level of pumping but the only statement to this
effect is made by Dr. Drury in his expert report, without providing evidence that the 21-

day test results were sufficient.6

In any event, Respondent notes that it was not sufficient to establish the existence of
water. Claimant’s analysis should have accounted for the exigencies of the area and
determine the amount of extractable water. Respondent notes that the conclusions drawn
by Mr. Jones in his expert report that the Fan Sediments could sustain the required levels
of pumping were not included in the 2009 Shomaker Report, which only provided the
results of his model simulations.’ In addition, Respondent maintains that Claimant
adopted an “unscientific, generic approach that lead to increased levels of uncertainty”
in particular with regard to the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones, which was based on

his view that the upper layers of the aquifer were made up of “a lot of sand and gravel,”
wich has a “standard literate value” of 15%.°° However, Respondent refers to its expert
Mr. Neville who reviewed the bore logs in the SMEC report and reached the conclusion
that the upper layers of the aquifer were primarily “clayey” and noted that clay materials
have a specific yield of 2% according to the US Geological Survey. Respondent submits
that on that basis, Mr. Neville concluded that the specific yield was closer to 2% as the
existence of clay reduces the specific yield on an exponential basis.**

728. Respondent notes that Mr. Jones did not dispute the specific yield of clay or the existence
of clay in the upper layers of aquifer and considers Mr. Jones’ position that clay yields
more water over time to be only an “unsupported opinion.” According to Respondent, the
average 2% specific yield in the US Geological Survey is based on long-term tests and
Mr. Jones in any event did not include a time scale for the specific yield in his model or
expert report.*°* Respondent rejects Mr. Jones’ position that the mixture of clay and gravel
produces a “normal specific yield” of 15% and also rejects Mr. Jones and Dr. Drury’s
reference to gamma logs for identifying the amount of clay in the sediments, arguing that

no gamma readings were taken of the three bore holes pumped during the 21-day test.°°

729. Respondent refers to Mr. Neville’s demonstration that a specific yield of 2% leads
undisputedly to a much larger drawdown in Afghanistan, which extends approximately
30 kilometers over the border based on Mr. Jones’ model. According to Respondent, this
must have been known to Claimant given that SMEC had advised Claimant in its reports
to conduct assessments in Afghanistan.5” In addition to the drawdown, Respondent
contends that a lower specific yield also increases CAPEX for purchase of additional
pumps and OPEX for maintenance and it requires Claimant to seek water at its other
potential sources, involving new permits, CAPEX and OPEX, and other communities
from whom Claimant would have to obtain a social license to operate. Respondent claims
that none of these issues are accounted for in the contingency calculations or other parts
of the Feasibility Study.*”!

730. With respect to the expected effects in Afghanistan, Respondent refers to its expert Dr.
Nanni who stated that Pakistan is bound by customary international law to the principles
and procedural rules of the UN Watercourse Convention and must notify Afghanistan
“very early in the planning process,” even if the transboundary effect of the project will
not occur for many years.*”? Referring to Mr. Neville, Respondent maintains that in this
case the drawdowns would in any event be seen “relatively quickly.”*”? Respondent
further claims that during the time period in which any concerns raised by Afghanistan
pursuant to such a notification would be discussed between the two countries, “Pakistan

would have to refrain from developing the project.”*™

731. Respondent maintains that the principles of the UN Watercourse Convention, including
“the obligation to use international watercourse in an equitable and reasonable manner
... and to notify potentially affected riparian states of planned measures,” are customary
international law and therefore binding on Pakistan.*’> Respondent considers that
Claimant has failed to provide any example of Pakistan publicly rejecting its customary
water obligations and also refers to the Indus Water Treaty it has concluded with India in
1960.87

732. According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to show that its use of the Fan Sediments
aquifer would have been equitable and reasonable which would have been for Pakistan
and Afghanistan to decide. Respondent notes that contrary to SMEC’s recommendation,
no visits or assessments were ever conducted in Afghanistan and refers to Mr. Mayer’s
testimony that the process “was never started.”*"’ Respondent further contends that given
the already tense relationship with Afghanistan over the border, local authorities would
not have allowed pumping from the Fan Sediments, which was, according to Respondent,
one of the primary reasons that SMEC had ranked them only third in its report.6”* At the
very least, Respondent submits that the process would likely have involved “lengthy

negotiations” leading to delays in using the Fan Sediments and claims that this risk was

“largely ignored” by Claimant.*”

733. Respondent also maintains its allegation that Claimant underestimated the project’s water
needs and its reference to the standard rate of water needed to process raw material of
approximately | cubic meter of water per 1 ton of material processed, which would more
than double the water need predicted in the Feasibility Study. In support of this allegation,
Respondent refers to the estimates in the US Geological Survey which it describes as
“widely accepted guidelines” and considers that Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen’s one-to-
one ratio is conservative against this background.**° In response to Claimant’s emphasis
on the process it planned to use for recovering water, Respondent considers it “striking”
that Claimant did not provide insight on the amount of water saved and further questions
whether there would be an overall net recovery of water given that studies revealed a
reduction of the overall water demand by only 3% and concluded that Claimant’s
“estimated [water] returns from Reko Dig are consistent with the returns from other

sites.”°8!

734. Respondent further argues that any buyer would have expected alternatives to the Fan
Sediments and maintains that Claimant “was not ready with suitable alternatives.”
Respondent acknowledges that Claimant explored four alternative groundwater sources
as part of its mitigation strategy but considers that this was insufficient to surmount the
risks associated with using the Fan Sediments as the primary water source. In its view,
Mr. Mayer confirmed in his oral testimony that he chose on behalf of Claimant to develop
the Fan Sediments as the only source of water, despite the recommendation of Dr. Drury
to develop at least two other water sources to augment the Fan Sediments. Respondent
further notes that the Feasibility Study does not include mitigation measures and in
particular did not discuss, test or cost aquifer injection even though Dr. Drury had
recommended that it be investigated.**? In this regard, Respondent notes that the ability
to re-inject water depended on having the necessary amount of water available and
maintains that given the “grave errors” in SMEC’s calculation of the volume of water,
this mitigation measure was “practically impossible.” In any event, Respondent considers
that re-injection would also have involved transboundary issues and necessitated
contacting the Afghan authorities, which as Mr. Livesey admitted was not done.***

735. Respondent further acknowledges that Dr. Drury described two of the other water sources

738.

as “very well-known” and “a very good water supply,” respectively, but considers that he
did not confirm that the other water sources were assessed to a feasibility level or that
they could supply enough water to Reko Diq to compensate the Fan Sediments.**
According to Respondent, the conclusions drawn by Dr. Drury in his expert report are not
supported by SMEC’s conclusions in its Water Resources Assessment Report, which did
not assess the long-term effects of pumping water at high volumes at any of these

alternative sources. **>

Respondent points out that the other two water sources had existing groundwater users,
including users located in Iran, and dismisses Claimant’s argument that it chose the Fan
Sediments to minimize the impact on such users, alleging that “[o]nce TCC ‘tapped’ the
Fan Sediments, it would have been faced with the same consequences to other users that
it sought to avoid.”**® Respondent argues that given the “extreme water scarcity of the
region, caused by massive groundwater pumping and the increasing occurrence of more
severe weather events, especially droughts,’ Claimant should have expected local
opposition. In Respondent’s view, “[i]t is utterly realistic to assume that local
communities would attribute any decrese in their well water levels to Reko Dig, whether
that is in fact the case.” Respondent points to measures taken by Saindak to address this

concern and considers that Claimant had planned “dittle to nothing” in this regard.5°’

Respondent further contends that there was no feasibility assessment on transporting the
water from these other water sources to Reko Diq and no cost estimates for additional
pumping wells and pipelines as well as potential electricity costs for running the pumps,
which would have “certainly added to the USD 95 million that TCC planned to spend on

developing the Fan Sediments alone.”***

As for the solution to pump seawater to Reko Dig, Respondent notes that the viability of
this option or the associated additional costs of USD 1.7 to 2.76 billion, which it bases on
Morgan Stanley estimates for the operating costs of a desalination facility per ton of
copper produced and Claimant’s estimate of the total copper reserves, was never
discussed by Claimant’s consultants and adds that this water pipeline would have faced
the same risks as the slurry pipeline to Port Gwadar. In any event, Respondent maintains

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

739. At the outset of its analysis on the issues regarding the groundwater source that was
contemplated to supply the required quantities of water to the project, the Tribunal recalls
that the argument that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source of its project was
raised by Respondent already in the liability phase of this proceeding. In its Decision on
on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal discussed this argument in the context of its
analysis of whether any of the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority in its Notice
of Intent to Reject the Mining Lease Application and/or by Respondent in the arbitration
justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application in November 2011. The alleged
failure to fully assess the water source was one of the reasons that Respondent raised for
the first time in this arbitration. While finding that Respondent should not be allowed to
rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal
in any event found that none of these additional reasons, including the reason invoked
with regard to the water source, would justify the denial of the Mining Lease
Application.**”

740. At the liability stage, the Tribunal noted that it appeared to be undisputed that Claimant
had made a full feasibility assessment of the groundwater source that it intended to use
for the project, i.e., the Baghicha Bore Field, which has in this phase more commonly
been referred to as the Fan Sediments, to the extent that the Pakistani side of the aquifer
was concerned. Based on a statement made by SMEC in its Final Report on the Water
Resource Assessment that all of Claimant’s preferred groundwater sources spanned
international borders but that hydrogeological assessment of the respective areas in Iran
and Afghanistan to feasibility level had not been carried out because SMEC had not
received Claimant’s permission to do so, the dispute between the Parties related to the
question whether it was inadequate for Claimant not to make a feasibility assessment for
the Afghan side of the aquifer.*”!

741.

In its analysis at the liability stage, the Tribunal relied in particular on the witness
testimony of Mr. Livesey during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability regarding the
significance of SMEC’s statement for the other water sources it had assessed, which
extended into Iran, the direction of water flow at the Fan Sediments from Pakistan into

Afghanistan, as well as the mitigation measures employed by Claimant to maintain
licenses at other groundwater sources.**? The Tribunal also considered it noteworthy that
the GOB had chosen the same water source for its own mining project, citing the
following advantages over other potential groundwater sources: “No other groundwater
user’; “Large volume of groundwater storage’ “Easy accessibility of pipe line route”;
and “Most of area of resource is in Pakistan.”* On that basis, the Tribunal was
convinced that “Claimant did in fact make an adequate assessment of the groundwater
source it intended to use for its project” and therefore concluded that this additional
ground invoked by Respondent did not present a justifiable basis for denying the Mining
Lease Application.**

The Tribunal further recalls that in its Decision on Respondent’s Request for
Reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability filed after Respondent’s
Counter-Memorial on Quantum, the Tribunal addressed, inter alia, Respondent’s
argument that the results of the drilling for water provided in Appendix 24.03 to the
Feasibility Study merit reconsideration of the Tribunal’s finding that Claimant presented
an adequate Feasibility Study meriting a mining lease because these results indicated,
according to Respondent, very low storage coefficients which in its view did not support

SMEC’s conclusions on the amount of water available at the Fan Sediments.**

The Tribunal noted in its reasoning that Respondent did not argue that the alleged error it
had identified in the Feasibility Study was known to the Licensing Authority at the time
it rejected TCCP’s Mining Lease Application or that it formed part of the ten grounds
invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject. Based on the Tribunal’s earlier finding that to
allow Respondent to rely on additional reasons in this arbitration would violate
Claimant’s right to be heard, the Tribunal concluded that a potential error in the
Feasibility Study that was not known to the Licensing Authority in November 2011 could
not decisively affect the Tribunal’s conclusion that the denial of the Mining Lease
Application was not justified by any of the reasons given by the Licensing Authority and
that “the real motive for the denial was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and
implement its own mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to
the CHEJVA and that the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a

pretext to conceal this motive.”®*°

The Tribunal further emphasized that “it did not make a finding that the Feasibility Study
was complete and/or that all assumptions and conclusions presented in the Study were

fully accurate. What the Tribunal did find was that none of the reasons invoked by the
Licensing Authority and, albeit it would not have been strictly necessary for its liability
finding, none of the additional reasons invoked by Respondent in the liability phase,
justified a denial of the Mining Lease Application. The question whether the assumptions
made in the Feasibility Study were adequate and realistic will become relevant in the
present quantum phase for the purposes of assessing the amount of damages to which
Claimant is entitled as a result of Respondent’s Treaty breach.”*””

Specifically with regard to its reliance on the witness testimony of Mr. Livesey and
Respondent’s expressed fear that the Tribunal’s factual findings would affect its
assessment of Respondent’s arguments during the quantum phase, the Tribunal stated the
following:
“(T]he Tribunal did not make a finding in the liability phase that the
Feasibility Study fully reflected the true value of the project at the time. It
only assessed the arguments presented by Respondent at the time in support
of its position that denial of the Mining Lease Application was based on
justifiable reasons. Neither of the Parties presented any opinions from
independent experts in the liability phase as they have now done in the
quantum phase. As Respondent’s reference to its experts Mr. Holmes and
[Dr.] Nanni shows, it was apparently only through their review of the relevant
data that the alleged errors were detected. Consequently, the Tribunal will
assess the arguments presented by Respondent with regard to the water issue
in its analysis on quantum once the Parties have completed their written
submissions and the Tribunal has heard the fact and expert witnesses during
the hearing on quantum on this issue.”***

As noted in the Tribunal’s Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request,
Respondent’s allegation that it had detected certain errors in the Feasibility Study, i.e.,
that the results of SMEC’s studies on water did not support the conclusions drawn in the
Feasibility Study regarding the size of the Fan Sediments and the amount of water
available, was based on an expert report authored by Mr. Holmes and Dr. Nanni of Water
Resource Associates (WRA) (“WRA Report”), which Respondent had submitted
together with its Counter-Memorial on Quantum.*” After the Decision on Respondent’s
Reconsideration Request had been rendered, Respondent submitted with its Rejoinder a
second expert report authored only by Dr. Nanni, in which she clarified that her
participation in the WRA Report had focused exclusively on water governance and
transboundary water issues and that her comments could be found in Section 5 of the
WRA Report, labelled “Water Governance and Transboundary Issues.” Dr. Nanni further

She then confirmed her assessments made in Section 5 of the WRA Report and

Mr. Holmes did not submit a second report in this arbitration. In preparation for the
Hearing on Quantum, Respondent informed Claimant that Mr. Holmes had terminated
his engagement with Pakistan and therefore could no longer be produced for examination
at the Hearing. On that basis and pointing out that Section 5 of the WRA Report authored
by Dr. Nanni, who remained available for examination, had been re-filed as a separate
report, Claimant requested that the Tribunal strike the WRA Report from the record.°?
In response, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to Claimant’s
request to strike the WRA Report “as it rests on an incomplete packet of information
provided by TCCA.” Respondent noted that, of two reports prepared by JSAI in
November 2009 and December 2009, respectively, the WRA Report could take into
account only the December 2009 report as the November 2009 report was produced by
Claimant only in November 2017, i.e., after the WRA Report had been submitted.
Respondent further stated that “[i]n light of TCCA’s failure to timely provide the
November Report in advance of the Counter-Memorial, Pakistan must insist that the
Tribunal strike all references to the WRA report made by TCCA and its experts.”
Claimant objected to the striking of all references to the WRA Report, emphasizing that
Respondent had not withdrawn its arguments based on the points made by Mr. Holmes
and noting that the analysis presented by its new expert, Mr. Neville, had a more limited
scope than the WRA Report and, according to Claimant, even confirmed that there would
be enough water in the aquifer for the life of the mine. Claimant further noted that the
November 2009 report referred to by Respondent had been provided to Pakistan five
months before the due date for its Rejoinder and was in any event “simply a later iteration
of the August Report’ and summarized in the SMEC 2010 Report both of which had been
available to Mr. Holmes when he prepared his expert report.°*

Based on the Parties’ submissions and in accordance with Section 16.9 of Procedural
Order No. 1, which provides that “[t]he Tribunal may disregard the testimony of a witness
or expert called to testify at the hearing who fails to appear at the hearing without
justified reasons,” the Tribunal decided to strike the WRA Report from the record, noting
that: (i) Respondent had not provided any reason for which Prof. Holmes had terminated
his engagement with Respondent and was no longer available for cross-examination; and
(ii) Respondent had received the additional report of JSAI on Groundwater-Flow

Modeling dated 6 November 2009 approximately five months before it filed its Rejoinder
an Quantum and rebuttal reports from its experts, as a result of which the Tribunal did
not understand this argument to serve as a reason for which Prof. Holmes had to terminate
his engagement with Respondent. The Tribunal further saw no basis for striking any
references to the WRA Report that were made in Claimant's submissions or the expert

reports filed by Claimant's experts.?°>

In line with this decision, the Tribunal will not take into account any of the opinions
expressed by Mr. Holmes in the WRA Report on which Respondent relied in support of
its allegation that the results of SMEC’s drilling did not support the conclusions drawn
regarding the amount of water available in the Fan Sediments. At the same time, it is
noted that Respondent continues to argue in its Post-Hearing Brief that by assuming that
aquifer was unconfined, Mr. Jones “assumed that much more water was available for
extraction and thereby arbitrarily reduced TCC’s projected impact on the groundwater
levels by a factor of 1,000” and relies on Mr. Neville’s testimony during the Hearing on
Quantum that “if the aquifer remains confined as it does during the 21 days, then the
effective storage coefficient [or the amount of water than can be extracted] would be 1,000

times smaller than has been assumed in all of the analyses.”°°°

Against this background, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant’s statement in its
Post-Hearing Brief that the only remaining issue in dispute is the extent of the drawdown
in Afghanistan. Rather, it appears to the Tribunal that in addition ot the drawdown and
the effects, if any, that such a drawdown would have on the feasibility and/or costs of the
project, Respondent continues to dispute that there would have been sufficient water
available in the Fan Sediments and that Claimant would have been able to extract the
required quantities of water at the costs estimated in the Feasibility Study. Respondent
further disputes that Claimant had sufficiently tested mitigation measures that might
potentially be employed in case it turned out that the Fan Sediments would for any reason
not be sufficient to serve as the only water source for the project. The Tribunal will
therefore address all of these issues in the following analysis.

i. Whether the Estimated Mine Water Demand of the Reko Diq Project
Was Reasonable

As a preliminary matter and before addressing the question whether Claimant has
established that the groundwater source it had chosen could supply sufficient water to the
Reko Dig project, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has also challenged the estimates
provided in the Feasibility Study regarding the amount of water needed for the project.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -238-

Respondent relies on its experts Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen who expressed the opinion

in their first expert report that the Feasibility Study “dramatically underestimated the

amount of water needed” and that a “standard design basis would be to start at I cubic

meter of water ... per 1 ton of material being processed. Over time projects are capable

of reducing this to 0.6 m¥/ton of ore processed, but this should appear in the IMD FS.”

Based on the assumption that 1 cubic meter of water would be needed for each ton of ore

to be mined per day, Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen calculated that the project would

require 4,583 cubic meters of water per hour and “[t]aking an optimistic approach of

0,8m3/ton of ore would suggest that 3,680 cubic meters of water per hour should be the

design basis.” They noted that the Feasibility Study pegged water usage at approximately

2,100 cubic meters per hour and considered that “[e]ven the best plants are not this

efficient” as a result of which “the base case for water usage is understated.”°"

752. As pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen did not cite any authority in

support of the “standard” of one cubic meter of water per ton of material being processed.

According to Claimant, their opinion ignored the “highly efficient” metallurgical process

that had been developed for the project as part of which “a large amount of water from

the tailings slurry would be recovered and returned for use in the process plant.” In

support of its submission, Claimant refers to its expert Mr. Mayer, Senior Manager of

Water and Tailings at Barrick at the time the Feasibility Study was prepared, who oversaw

the work for the Reko Diq project regarding water balance, water supply, and concentrate

slurry pipeline design.” Mr. Mayer stated in his report that “[m]inimizing the amount of

water consumed on-site was a key consideration throughout the design process.” He

explained that the concentration of ore minerals through the “flotation” proces:

 

core purpose of the operation and drives water demand calculation.” He further

explained that both the rougher tailings slurry stream created from the initial float,

comprising 93.5% of the total tailings mass generated, and the cleaner tailings steam

created after secondary grinding and further flotation, comprising about 5% of the total

tailing mass, would be thickened at the plant site to recover as much water as possible,

which would be returned to the process plant for use.°!° With regard to the mine water

demand, Mr. Mayer stated:

“The largest source of water consumption at Reko Dig occurs at the rougher
tailings facility. This consumption is made up of moisture trapped between
the tailings particles after consolidation, seepage from the facility, and
evaporation. Consumption at the rougher and cleaner facilities constitutes
about 87% of the total water demand.

The remaining 13% of water consumed at Reko Dig includes water in the
concentrate slurry stream, potable, dust control, and evaporation.

Total water consumption, minus water recovered from the tailings storage
facility after consolidation and return water from other minor sources, equals
the mine water demand.

As a result, the Mine Water Demand for operations was calculated at 2,410
cubic meters per hour (670 l/s) for the IMD phase and 4,625 cubic meters per
hour (1,285 l/s) for the EXP phase.1 The estimate of Mine Water Demand
evolved over time as the process and tailings facility designs were refined.

In order to be conservative for the purpose of estimating the effects of
pumping from the Fan Sediments aquifer on the groundwater levels, the
project assumed that the water could not be recovered from the tailings
storage facilities, and that water would have to be made up from the Fan
Sediments aquifer. Under this conservative assumption, the mine water
demand would be 730 I/s (IMD) and 1460 I/s (EXP).

For the purpose of sizing the capacity of the water supply pipeline, the project
assumed no water recovered from the tailings facilities, the average annual
peak water consumption year, and the 92% planned availability of the
process plant. Under these conditions the mine water demand would be 800
l/s (IMD) and 1,630 I/s (EXP) and would be equal to the maximum peak
instantaneous rate.”'!

753. Mr. Mayer referred to Chapter 8 of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study entitled “Water

Management,” which provides in Section 8.7 on the Water Management Plan an overall
water balance for the Initial Mine Development and the Expansion.?'* The numbers for

the Initial Mine Development are also contained in Chapter 8 of the Feasibility Study.?'?

Specifically in response to the rate of one cubic meter of water per one ton of ore
processed advanced by Respondent and its experts, Mr. Mayer considered that this
approach would “unnecessarily increase capital and operating costs for water and
tailings management to the project and would be irresponsible socially and
environmentally” as it would be “an immense waste of water and of other resources used
for flotation and tailings management.” Mr. Mayer also stated that applying this “rule of
thumb would be terribly inefficient because excess water in the tailings storage facility
would slow tailings consolidation requiring increased capacity ... and would maximize
the need for offsite water from the Fan Sediments aquifer.”'* Mr. Mayer acknowledged
that “[s]ome older mines took this approach prior incorporation of thickeners and
efficient tailings management practices’ but stated that he was not aware of any modern

mines operating in this manner. Mr. Mayer further emphasized that in their calculations
of water demand, Claimant’s team did not rely on “a general rule of thumb” but rather on
test work on tailing samples generated from the metallurgical test work for the project

which form the basis for the tailings thickeners and the tailings facility designs.?'>

Mr. Mayer also stated that the team estimated the chance to reclaim up to 9% of the water
from the tailings facility by design and tailings management practices.°!° In this regard,
Mr. Mayer referred to Appendix 28.28 of the Feasibility Study, which is a Memorandum
prepared by Knight Piésold Consulting on Rougher Tailings Facility Feasibility Design
dated 30 July 2009. This Memorandum evaluated in detail three thickened tailings storage
options based on Phase 4 tailings tests and recommended as the base case for the
Feasibility Study Option 2 which was described as a “hybrid of Options 1 and 3” and
would, inter alia, be more water efficient than Option 3.2'7 The Memorandum presented
the water demands for the rougher facility options and the cleaner facility as well as the
capital and operating costs associated with each option and a decising making - ranking

matrix.°!8

In response to Mr. Mayer’s explanation of the approach contemplated by Claimant,
Respondent argued that “[w]hile these maneuvers seem practical in theory, they provide
no insight into the amount of water saved. Nor does TCCA indicate by how much the
demand for water would be reduced.” In Respondent’s view, Claimant’s arguments
should not be trusted because: (i) “TCCA’s two methods for conserving water—extracting
water from the slurry and reclaiming more water from the slurry at the storage facility—
have an inverse relationship”; and (ii) “the studies conducted on this process do not
reveal a significant decrease in the overall water demand.”

In support of its argument, Respondent relies on the same Memorandum of Knight
Piésold Consulting dated 30 July 2009 in which the results of the Phase 4 tailings tests
are presented in comparison to the previous Phase 3 test results and it is stated:

“The most notable variation in the two Rougher samples is the reduction in
supernatant released from the Phase 4 sample. At 67% solids there is an
estimated 6% reduction in the percent of supernatant water released. As a
result the improved water recovery due to operation at 67% solids is offset
by a reduction in supernatant production and the resulting theoretical water
demand from the tailings is only reduced by 3%. Individual options vary

depending on layout and operation as discussed in more detail in Section

4.7920
Respondent further relies on Appendix C to an additional Memorandum prepared by the
same consulting firm on Water Balance Modelling and & Decant Return dated 16
December 2008. Appendix C contains a comparison between a scenario in which the
Yesolids of the rougher tailings are increased to 64%, as it was done in Phase 3 tailings
tests, and the scenario in which they are increased to 67%, as it was done in Phase 4
tailings tests. It is noted that “increasing the %solids of the rougher tailings from 64% to
67% solids results in reduction in water loss of about 8% (0.033 m3/t of tailings sent to
the rougher facility).” Appendix C further states:

“Thus although the supernatant production reduces as the %solids increases,

the water loss (water output — water return) also reduces as the solids

increases. For a change from 64% solids to 67% solids the reduction is
approximately 0.033 m3/t of water.

For the overall project assessment this reduction in water loss needs to be

compared to the relative capital and operating costs (in particular flocculant

consumption) of the different thickeners being considered.”*”'
Based on its own review of the memoranda relied on by Respondent, the Tribunal agrees
with Respondent to the extent that there appears to be a correlation between increasing
the percentage to which rougher tailings are thickened and a lowering of the supernatant
production in the facility itself. However, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent’s
argument that the memoranda would reveal no significant decrease in the overall water
demand. In particular, the Tribunal understands that the decrease of 3% reported in the
30 July 2009 Memorandum referred to the difference between Phase 3 tailings tests and
Phase 4 tailings tests in which the rougher tailings tests were thickened to 64% and 67%,
respectively. The same applies to the 16 December 2008 Memorandum, which also
compares the results of increasing the percentage from 64% to 67%. Neither of the two
Memoranda compares the results of Phase 4 tailings tests to a scenario in which no
thickeners would be used and therefore they do not support Respondent’s allegation that
using thickeners would not contribute to a significant decrease in the overall water
demand. In addition, while the 16 December 2008 Memorandum refers to “relative
capital and operating costs ... of the different thickeners being considered,” it does not
provide any support for Respondent’s allegation that the advantages of their use would
be offset by their additional costs.

The Tribunal further notes that Respondent’s experts Prof. Dagdelen and Mr. Owen did
not respond to Mr. Mayer’s explanation why the rate of one cubic meter of water per one

tor of ore processed they had introduced would, in his opinion, overestimate the project’s
water needs. Neither did Respondent’s expert on water-related matters, Mr. Neville,
express an opinion on this matter.

In addition, the Tribunal finds convincing Mr. Mayer’s explanation that through the
process of thickening rougher tailings as well as cleaner tailings, Claimant would have
been able to recover and reuse a significant amount of water, which would have decreased
the amount of water to be supplied from an off-site groundwater source. Neither
Respondent nor its experts have engaged in any detail with the estimates provided in the
Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study based, inter alia, on the tests
performed on the rougher tailings. While Respondent maintains that the rate of one cubic
meter of water per ton of ore processed forms part of “widely accepted guidelines”

contained in the US Geological Survey of 2012,°”7

it has not engaged with the specific
process Claimant had designed for the Reko Diq project and has not challenged any
specific part of this process or a particular aspect of the estimated water needs calculated
based on the tests performed. Consequently, the Tribunal sees no basis to assume that the
process would not be able to achieve the estimated water recovery and/or the estimated

overall water balance presented in Chapter 8 of both Studies.

Finally, the Tribunal has also taken note of Mr. Mayer’s unchallenged testimony that in
order to be conservative, the final estimate of mine water demand in the Feasibility Study
and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study is based on the assumption that no water could
be recovered from the tailings facilities.°* In the absence of any specific challenge to the
process contemplated by Claimant or to the estimate of mine water demand included in
the Studies, the Tribunal will base its further analysis in this section on the assumption
that the amount of water needed was appropriately estimated by Claimant.

ii. Whether Sufficient Water Was Available to Meet the Mine Water
Demand of the Reko Dig Project

As to the question whether Claimant has established that the Fan Sediments contained
sufficient quantities of water to supply the Reko Dig project based on the estimated mine
water demand, Claimant considers that this was confirmed by all four hydrogeological
experts during the Hearing on Quantum. Respondent, on the other hand, considers that
Claimant’s expert Dr. Drury acknowledged that the Fan Sediments would most likely not
have provided sufficient water for Reko Dig. In light of these deviating interpretations,
the Tribunal will review the testimony of the Parties’ experts in more detail. As noted
above, the Tribunal will not take into account the opinions expressed by Mr. Holmes in
the WRA Report. However, given that Respondent continues to pursue the argument that

initially relied on Mr. Holmes’ analysis and given that the Tribunal saw no basis for
striking the references to his analysis made by Claimant’s experts from the record, the
Tribunal will also take into account the opinions expressed by Claimant’s experts on the
argument initially supported by Mr. Holmes.

Claimant’s expert Dr. Drury stated during the presentation of his findings at the Hearing
on Quantum that “our conclusion is that the Fan Sediments can supply a sustainable
groundwater supply to Reko Dig Mine. And the alternative supplies also have very large
resources available to supply the mine as well.”°*4 For the Fan Sediments, Dr. Drury
based this conclusion on the 21-day pump test conducted by SMEC in 2008, which he
described as “an extraordinary event’ that he had never carried out before in his 45-year
experience. He testified that most water supply pump tests are carried out over one to
three days and that he had experienced only one exception with a 10-day pump test.°”°
Dr. Dury then explained the tests performed by SMEC at the three alternative water
resources and also referred to “a very big peer-review process” involving internal
reviewers at SMEC as well as external reviewers from Claimant, Antofagasta and third-

party consultants.°”°

Respondent contends that during cross-examination, Dr. Drury “expressly recognized
that the Fan Sediments would most likely not have provided enough water to Reko
Digq.””?’ It relies on the following testimony of Dr. Drury:
“Q. ... Mr. Drury, you say in Paragraph 67 of your Report that you were
confident that water existed at Balochistan from a combination of
groundwater around Reko Dig to supply the mine requirements.
Do you see that?
In your Expert Report and also in the SMEC Report, you don't say that the
Fan Sediments would have been enough. You say that it's a combination of
groundwater sources is the one that would have supply-and-demand
requirement?

A. Yes.
Q. Do you agree?
A. That's what I say, yes.

Q. And you also say that, ‘It's my understanding that TCC intended to initially
develop the Baghicha Borefield and then augment water supplies from at least
one other nearby groundwater source.’

766. As pointed out by Respondent, Dr. Drury stated in his expert report:

“My overall impression from the aquifer testing and modelling results was
that there was sufficient groundwater available from a combination of the
groundwater development sites around Reko Dig to supply the mine

‘s. It is my under ding that TCC i ded to initially develop
the Baghicha Borefield (Fan Sediments) and then augment water supplies
from at least one other nearby groundwater source (Patangaz and/or Upper
Tahlab).”°?

 

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent to the extent that Dr. Drury apparently did not
consider it certain that the aquifer at the Fan Sediments would by itself have provided
sufficient water for Reko Diq over the entire life of the mine. In particular, the Tribunal
does not understand Dr. Drury’s conclusion that the Fan Sediments could provide a
“sustainable groundwater supply to Reko Dig mine” to mean that no other water sources
would be needed over the life of the mine. To the contrary, Dr. Drury’s statement in his
report that sufficient groundwater would be available “from a combination of the
groundwater development sites around Reko Dig’ and his understanding that Claimant
intended to first develop the Fan Sediments and then “augment water supplies from at
least one other nearby groundwater source,” together with the clarification he provided
during the Hearing that the Fan Sediments were to serve as “the primary water supply,”
with the other sources being “fallback positions,” confirm his recommendation in the
SMEC reports that “in addition to the Fan Sediments, at least two other independent
water supply sources be developed for water supply purposes,” which he understood was
incorporated by Claimant into the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study

as well as the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment.?*”

Mr. Mayer also explained that the Fan Sediments were chosen as the primary water source
but that SMEC recommended that Claimant retain its existing No Objection Certificates
(NOCs) in the areas of the three alternative sources. He agreed with this advice and the
NOCs were retained. Mr. Mayer further confirmed that “[t]he feasibility studies carried
out by SMEC indicated that each of these areas was a viable option to supplement the
Fan Sediments aquifer yields if required.”?*!

In Respondent’s view, Dr. Drury’s testimony confirmed that the Fan Sediments would
“most likely not have provided enough water to Reko Dig.” The Tribunal cannot follow
this interpretation. As for the volume of water in storage, Dr. Drury explained in his expert

report that SMEC in its 2009 report did “not present a definitive calculation on
groundwater reserve within aquifers as sufficient data across the borders was not
available” and noted that a “measurement of the volume of groundwater in storage does
not, by itself, indicate how much water can be extracted from the aquifer.” He explained
that “the projected groundwater yield of a multilayered hydrogeological system over
long-term pumping (possibly many decades) can only be made through groundwater
modeling” for the discussion of which he referred to Claimant’s expert Mr. Jones from
JSAI.°” Dr. Drury explained that the estimate of water volume in bulk storage in the 2009
SMEC report “was a simple ranking mechanism to compare the attributes of the three
main potential borefields (Upper Tahlab, Patanganz and Fan Sediments) — what is small,
medium and large” based on the concept of Total Porosity. He emphasized that “[i]n the
absence of an extensive knowledge of each aquifer system,” SMEC did “not discuss the
volume of groundwater that can be physically extracted from the aquifer — this is a
conclusion that can only be reached once the complete groundwater system is
understood.”°*? Dr. Drury further explained why in his view, the assumptions made in the
WRA Report “considerably underestimated groundwater availability.”?** As the WRA
Report has been struck from the record, the Tribunal does not have to address these
aspects in further detail. However, based on his explanations, Dr. Drury further concluded
that: “[i]f anything, SMEC may have underestimated the volume of water in storage in
that: (i) clay aquitards and aquifers in Layer I will leak vertically to the pumped aquifers;
(ii) groundwater from the deep aquifers may migrate upwards during long-term pumping
periods; and (iii) additional groundwater may be available from the deep, narrow trench

system.”

Mr. Jones confirmed in his expert report that the amount of water available for extraction
from the Fan Sediments is determined based on the porosity of the saturated sediments,
ranging from 10% to 40% of the volume of the aquifer. Specifically with regard to the
storage coefficients in respect of which Respondent claims to have identified an error in
the calculation of the available water volume, Mr. Jones explained that “[t]he confined
storage coefficients describe short-term water-level changes in response to pumping, in
the pressurized sections of aquifer intersected by wells, but they have nothing to do with
the volume of water in storage, which is a function of porosity. The confined storage
coefficient equates to a porosity of 0.03% well below the physically-possible range of
porosity for sedimentary materials (about 10% to 40%).”°*° Mr. Jones further expressed

the opinion that “WRA’s physically-impossible low estimate of porosity results in a
dramatic under-estimate of the amount of groundwater stored in the Fan Sediments.”?*"
He explained:
“The confined storage coefficients are results obtained from the 21-day
pump-out test that depressurized, but did not drain, the individual strata
providing water to the pumping wells. They do not reflect the physical water
content of materials in the aquifer. Actual draining of aquifer sediments
would only begin after more time and pumping, when the water in the aquifer
is no longer held under pressure.
The calculations by WRA estimating the volume of water in storage based on
the confined storage coefficients, which amount to the equivalent of 0.03%
porosity, are not credible. Unconsolidated and semi-consolidated sediments
(dirt) never have such a low porosity.”?*8

As noted above, Mr. Holmes, on whose opinion Respondent had relied with regard to the
alleged error regarding the storage coefficient, did not present a second report and, for
reasons which remain unknown to the Tribunal, terminated his engagement with
Respondent before the Hearing on Quantum and was no longer available for cross-
examination. Together with its Rejoinder on Quantum, Respondent submitted an expert
report by Mr. Neville, who reviewed in detail the 21-day pump test conducted by SMEC.
In his expert report, Mr. Neville also used the term “storage coefficient” and presented a
detailed memorandum on “{t]he significance and magnitudes of aquifer storage
coefficients” as an appendix to his report. He did not, however, confirm the criticism
raised by Mr. Holmes that the confined storage coefficients obtained through the 21-day
pump-out test did not support the conclusions drawn by SMEC regarding the amount of
water available in the Fan Sediments. Mr. Neville rather noted that the 21-day test had
not been sufficient “to constrain the specification of the specific yield’ and considered
that the specific yield of 0.15 assumed by Mr. Jones in his model was “not representative
of the sediments that will be drained by long-term pumping” but should have been
“smaller, on the order of 0.02.”**? The dispute between the Parties regarding the specific
yield and its impact on the extent of the drawdown in Afghanistan will be addressed
further below.

In its Post-Hearng Brief on Quantum, Respondent maintained the argument, however,
that Mr. Jones had incorrectly assumed in his model that the aquifer was unconfined even
though it had remained confined during the 21-day test and relied on the oral testimony
of Mr. Neville, who confirmed during his direct examination at the Hearing on Quantum

that “[b]ased solely on the 21 days, the aquifer was responding as a confined aquifer."

Mr. Neville further explained the consequence of an aquifer being confined or unconfined
as follows:

“The difference is in the effective storage coefficient. So, that's the term I've
used. So, the effective storage coefficient--that's how water re-enters the
aquifer after 21 days--is on the order of three zeros and a I, something like
that. So, the point 0--10 to the minus 4, .001.

In contrast, if the water does in the end come from vertical drainage at the
water table, then the effective parameter would be if--2 percent? 15 percent?
Whatever; the point is, much, much larger than the confined storage
coefficient. A factor of 1,000, larger than this confined storage coefficient.

So, that means in [sic] the aquifer remains confined as it does during the 21
days, then the effective storage coefficient would be 1,000 times smaller than
has been assumed in all of the analyses, whether Mr. Jones's analyses or
mine. And the implications would be the following: The drawdowns--that's
the declines in water levels--would be much larger. The absolute magnitudes
of the drawdowns would be much larger.

Secondly, the extent of the drawdown cone--so, how much water level has
declined, say, in Afghanistan would be much larger. So, we--my analysis--we
predict--Mr. Jones and I confirm his results--predicted drawdowns on the
order of 3 meters at the Afghani border. And with the storage coefficient that's
1,000 times lower, they would probably be on the order of--I don't know. 30
meters? 300 meters? Some--well, not 300 because that would drain the
aquifer completely, but some much larger level of drawdown. So, that's one
implication.

The other implication is that the feasibility of the water supply would be
called into question because the depths from which--since the water levels
are depressed even further, the height at which water has to be lifted to get it
into a pipeline would have to be that much higher. The energy requirements
would be that much higher. You'd need more pumps. You'd need more wells.
You'd need more than the 22 wells because the wells would interfere with
each other over the long term; right?”**!

773. In the Tribunal’s view, Mr. Neville’s testimony confirms that if the aquifer remained
confined as it had during the 21-day test, the effective storage coefficient would be 1,000
times smaller and the drawdown to be expected in Afghanistan would be much larger
than assumed both by Mr. Jones and by Mr. Neville himself. However, Mr. Neville
provided this explanation in response to the abstract question regarding the difference
between an unconfined and a confined aquifer. He did not express the opinion that the
Fan Sediments would in fact remain confined in the long term. While he disagreed with
Mr. Jones as to whether the effective parameter would be 2% or 15%, he in any event
agreed that the relevant parameter is the specific yield, which will be addressed below,

rather than a much lower confined storage coefficient. During his presentation at the
Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Neville explicitly stated that “J happen to believe that a more
realistic value for these sediments is significantly lower [than the 15% assumed by Mr.
Jones], but it’s much bigger than the confined storage coefficient.”** Against this
background, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent’s allegation that Mr. Jones, by basing
his model on the assumption that water would be flowing from the upper layers of the
aquifer, he over-estimated the amount of water available for extraction and thereby
“arbitrarily reduced TCC’s projected impact on the groundwater levels by a factor of
1,000.73

In addition, as pointed out by Claimant, Mr. Neville testified in response to the question
whether there was enough water to go ahead with the project: “J don’t think it’s a question
of how much water is available. I think it’s a question of how feasible it is to get to the
water.” He then confirmed: “J don't think it's a question of how much water is there. It's
a big area, and I have no doubt that the volume of water that they need is there in the
sediments. They've certainly done a good job of showing that.”°** Mr. Neville explained
that if he had been working for Barrick, he would have provided cost estimates for the
potential need of additional pumping wells and a reinjection system as well as the risk
that water would have to be pumped out from deeper levels, which would have increased
electricity or diesel costs. He stated:
“So, I think the water is there, but is it a question of--to me, it's a question of

how feasible it to get out [sic], and, if anything, I would want to exaggerate
how much it's really going cost.

ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV: So, just to summarize, to make sure I
understand you correctly, the answer to the question of how feasible it is to
get the water out is translated into are there adequate provisions for
increased costs in the feasibility studies.

THE WITNESS: (Mr. Neville) I would say so. Yeah. I would say so. And I
don't think they are insubstantial costs; right?

ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV: Understood.”**

In response to the question whether his response related to the Fan Sediments or the whole
area around Reko Digq, Mr. Neville clarified that “from studying the SMEC work, it was
clear to me that there was a recognition that the Fan Sediments alone might not be--even
if the water--the volume of water is there, that it might not be feasible to get all of the
mine water requirements just from the Fan Sediments. So, they were already

contemplating seriously other sources of water.”**® This was confirmed by Dr. Drury who
stated that the Fan Sediments was the primary source of water chosen by Claimant but
that “in any major mining water-supply project, you always have backup systems” and
SMEC therefore recommended to retain the NOCs for the other “huge aquifer deposits
in the area.” He emphasized that “the other ones, it’s not because we doubted Fan

Sediments, but we had NOCs that we retained in case there was an issue in the future.*7

In light of this testimony by the Parties’ experts, the Tribunal considers it established that
there was sufficient water available for the Reko Dig project. While Claimant had chosen
to develop the Fan Sediments as its primary water source, it had, upon recommendation
from SMEC, decided to also retain the No Objection Certificates over the areas in which
the other water sources were located. The question that remains to be answered is whether
the cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study adequately accounted for the
possibility that Claimant might have to resort to using other water sources besides the Fan
Sediments and/or that Claimant might have to spend additional costs at the Fan Sediments
because of deeper drilling or measures required to mitigate the drawdown into
Afghanistan.

Respondent argues that Claimant does not make reference to the alternative water sources
or the costs associated with having to develop them in the Feasibility Study and

 

Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. Dr. Drury confirmed in his expert report that for the
purposes of the Feasibility Study, SMEC produced its Final Report in 2010, which was
an extract of the 2009 report that focused on the Fan Sediments.”#* Claimant emphasized,

and this was confirmed by Mr. Mayer in his expert repo:
water sources were assessed to feasibility level. While Respondent disputes this, it did
not provide any evidence in support of its allegation that the assessments were not
sufficient for the purposes of demonstrating the availability of alternative water sources

that could be used in addition to the primary water source.

Respondent contends that Dr. Drury “was not able to go so far as to say that the other
sources were assessed to a feasibility level.”®°° The Tribunal notes, however, that in
response to the question whether he would agree that the other groundwater sources were
not at a feasibility level or a pre-feasibility level, Dr. Drury expressly stated: “No, no.
Absolutely not. I reject that.”®>! He testified that “[t]he Upper Tahlab was very extensively

to the mine, so have a 15-year pump test.” Dr. Drury also referred to “more pump tests
and more drilling” carried out by SMEC as a result of which the Upper Tahlab “is very
well known.”? As for Patangaz, Dr. Drury explained the drilling carried out by SMEC
and the information from such drilling which was incorporated into the model, concluding
that “[i]t was a feasibility at that location. So, I have little doubt at all that it was a very
good water supply for the mine site.” Finally, as to the transportation of the water to
Reko Diq, Dr. Drury testified that “Fan Sediments was feasibility’ and the other
groundwater sources were “J would say pre-feasibility. Surveying geotech work was
done.” He confirmed his statement in the SMEC December 2009 report that “[m]ost water
delivery systems for the various preferred groundwater sources, areas, and from the
ocean are designed to pre-feasibility level’ but also testified that “[t]he pipeline design
was still happening when [he] left the project” in March 2009 and “more work was carried

on for another three months.”?**

While the Tribunal is therefore not convinced by Respondent’s allegation that Claimant
failed to conduct feasibility assessments of the alternative water sources, this does not yet
answer the question whether it also accounted for the costs associated with the possibility
of having to develop either of these additional water sources in order to supply sufficient
water to the Reko Diq project. Given that the other water sources were not discussed in
the chapter on Water Management in the Feasibility Study and the chapter on Capital
Costs states that “[t]he water supply pipeline estimate is based on the source of water

from the Fan Sediments,”

without making reference to alternative water sources, it
indeed appears that potential costs associated with these other water sources were not
included in the cost budget for the water supply in the Feasibility Study and Claimant

does not argue otherwise.

However, this does not appear unreasonable to the Tribunal given that Claimant planned
on developing the Fan Sediments as its primary water source and would resort to the other
water sources only if and when required to do so. Mr. Mayer confirmed during the
Hearing on Quantum that “Fan Sediments was to be used for the whole life of the mine;
however, we were going to intaii , not intain, but the i ion was to

the NOCs in the other areas in case mitigation was necessary. That mitigation could be

As pointed out by Claimant and confirmed by Respondent,?*’

the residual risk register
included risks and associated cost estimates relating to the insufficiency of the Fan
Sediments and the need to develop other water sources besides the Fan Sediments, which
will be set out in further detail below. Specifically, it included the following risks: (i)
“Available water resource insufficient to supply operating requirements (including slurry
pipeline), resulting in production interruptions and/or additional expenses”, (ii) “Water
usage by project from alternate sources than Fan Sediments (i.e. the back up supply)
causes drawdowns that impact locals (Pakistan drawdown of wetlands, domestic and
agriculture water supply) resulting in negative perceptions re. the project and additional
compensation costs”; and (iii) “Draw down of water by others leaves insufficient water
for project needs caused by the current legislation not explicitly protecting the rights to
use water (quantity and duration) results in the need to develop alternative sources.” In
addition, the risk register also identified the risk that “A lender requires the project to
engage in cross border consultation with [Afghanistan / Iran] due to the [Fan Sediments
/ Patangaz] water supply.” These risks were captured with an additional capex and/or

opex estimate and included in Prof. Davis’ model.*°*

Respondent did not raise a specific argument as to why the cost estimates assigned to
these risks would not fully capture the costs associated with the possibility that Claimant
might have to develop an alternative water source in the future in order to supply
sufficient water to the Reko Diq project.

In any event, the Tribunal considers it established that there was sufficient water available
for the project when considering all of these potential water sources. While Claimant’s
experts could not exclude that Claimant might have to resort to alternative water sources
at some point, there was agreement, including by Respondent’s expert Mr. Neville, that
the Fan Sediments and the alternative water sources would together be able to provide
sufficient water to the Reko Diq project. Mr. Neville explicitly stated that “J think the
water is there, but is it a question of--to me, it's a question of how feasible it to get out,

and, if anything, I would want to exaggerate how much it's really going cost.”

on the question whether the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones in the groundwater
model led to an adequate prediction of the potential effects of long-term pumping. It
appears to be undisputed that the specific yield of 0.15 that Mr. Jones used in his model
could not directly be derived from the results of the 21-day pump-out test.

According to Mr. Neville, “[t]he 21-day duration of the pumping test is not sufficient to
contrain the specification of the specific yield” and, “[i]n the absence of data to contrain

the analyses, the results of the Shomaker (2009) groundwater model are speculative.”°°

As pointed out by Respondent, Dr. Drury confirmed during the Hearing on Quantum that
“t]he 21-day pump test gave you the storage coefficient and transmissivity of this
confined aquifer. The specific yield relates to the upper horizons in the 21-day pump test.
There was not any indication of a specific yield.”*®! He confirmed that it was not possible
to calculate the specific yield in the 21 days and explained that “[t]he Fan Sediment is in
the upper aquifer. We pumped from the--which is 50--60 or 70 meters below the surface.
We're pumping from 150, 200 meters. In that 21 days, we haven't got values of specific
yield. The specific yield may not be found for six months. It may be 12 months before it is
determined.” When asked what it tells about the aquifer that the specific yield was not
determined during the 21-day pump test, Dr. Drury testified that “what it tells the aquifer
is actually a very extensive aquifer. The water level drawdown from those free-pumping
bores was small, and you have to remember that this aquifer from Mirjawa Hills to the
Baghicha Borefield is 10 kilometers, and from Baghicha borefield to Gowd-e-Zereh
another 15, so that's 25 kilometers, and 70 kilometers long. And what we are doing, we've
got alittle pinprick, a little pinprick of where we've actually got our bores in this big area,
and we've drawn down this little point in this huge aquifer system. So, it shows that we
have a very extensive aquifer. We've only made a dent in the system. The water level
drawdown, away from production bore, was only 500 meters. Those which would be
1,000 meters away almost didn't respond to pumping. So, we have a very, very restricted-

-so, we have a huge aquifer, and we're just a little pinprick in the whole system.”°°

Mr. Jones also agreed with Mr. Neville’s statement that “[t]he 2-day duration of the
pump test is not sufficient to constrain the specification of the specific yield.” He
explained that the reason for this was that “we pumped from some confined strata, about
200 meters down in the aquifer, and we measured no response in the shallow water table
in the unconfined strata and so, therefore, we don't know the specific yield.” He added

that “[t]his is very encouraging news. It means that the aquifer will sustain pumping of a
much greater scale than we tested.”

While the Parties’ experts are therefore in agreement as to the fact that the specific yield
could not be determined based on the results of the 21-day pump-out test, they disagree
as to the consequences to be drawn from that knowledge as well as to whether the specific
yield could reliably be determined in a different manner. First of all, the Tribunal takes
note of Dr. Drury’s statement that it might have taken six or even 12 months of pumping
before the specific yield would be found. Dr. Dury also testified that “[t]he 27-day pump
test is an extraordinary event” and that he had “never carried out a 21-day pump test in
all [his] 45 years’ experience” but that in “at least 95, 97 percent of [his] experience, one
to three days’ pumping is what it carried out” with one exception where a 10-day pump
test had been carried out at the request of the water authority. He emphasized that “[y]ou

don’t pump 50 years to prove you have a water supply for a 50-year mine.”°®

Mr. Mayer also testified that in his professional opinion, “2/ days is an unusually long
time to perform a pumpout test, much longer than is required to determine permeability
and storage properties of the aquifer” and that he had “never participated in a pump-out
test that lasted a full 21 days. Typically, these tests last three or four days or up to a week

at most.”

By contrast, Mr. Neville expressed the opinion that the data collected during the 21-day
pump test demonstrated “only that three wells within the study area can be pumped for
21 days at a cumulative rate of 70 L/s.”°*" Apart from the disagreement as to whether 70
I/s was the correct figure even though the pumping rates at the three wells were 40 I/s, 40

V/s and 30 l/s, respectively,°*

the Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Neville’s apparent
argument that the test was not able to demonstrate anything more than the amount and
rate actually pumped during the test. As pointed out by Dr. Drury, the requirement cannot
be that a test would have the same duration as the life of the mine. In addition, neither
Respondent nor Mr. Neville disputed Dr. Drury and Mr. Mayer’s opinion that a 21-day
test was considerably longer than the usual duration of pump-out tests and thus exceeded
industry standards. While Respondent pointed to the undisputed fact that the amount of
water pumped during the test was much lower than the amount to be pumped over the life
of the mine and alleged that “[g]iven these differences, TCC could not possibly have

Neville made any statement as to the length they would have considered appropriate for
the test let alone provide any supporting authority for such an opinion.

791. Against this background, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would have
considered the 21-day pump-out test carried out at the Fan Sediments insufficient and/or
that it would have agreed with Mr. Neville’s opinion that Mr. Jones’ predictions of the
long-term drawdown were “necessarily speculative” because the specific yield was not
determined during the test.

792. Consequently, the remaining question for the Tribunal to address is the dispute between
Mr. Jones and Mr. Neville as to the appropriate specific yield to be used for the material
in the Fan Sediments, which undisputedly affects the expected drawdown across the
Afghan border and therefore could have resulted in additional costs for the project.

793. In his expert report, Mr. Neville criticized Mr. Jones for having applied a specific yield
of 0.15 in the groundwater model he created in 2009. Mr. Neville expressed the opinion
that “[t]he assumed value of specific yield, 0.15, is representative of coarse-grained
materials, whereas the sediments that will be drained are clayey. A value of the specific
yield that is smaller, on the order of 0.02, should have been assigned to the Fan
Sediments.” According to Mr. Neville, the assumption of a 0.15 specific yield led to an
underprediction of the potential effects of pumping, specifically of the drawdown cone
which would be deeper and “significantly broader” when using a 0.02 specific yield.?”

794. Mr. Neville explained that values of the specific yield vary from almost zero to 0.50, with
values of 0.2 to 0.25 being typical for coarse-grained sands and gravel and values “on the
order of 0.02” for clays and other fine-grained materials. In support of his opinion that
the “relatively small value” of 0.02 should have been used for the Fan Sediments, Mr.

Neville presented the following tables:*”!

796. Mr. Neville further pointed out that the water table, which controls drainage of the

797.

sediments, is located within primarily clayey sediments at all three wells. He also refers
to “[d]ata presented in the literature [which] indicate that even a relatively small amount
of clay issufficient to reduce the hydraulic conductivity of coarse-grained materials by
orders-of-magnitude so that they act as barriers to groundwater flow.” He therefore
concludes that a smaller specific yield, “on the order of 0.02, should have been assigned
for the Fan Sediments.”°”

In his further analysis, Mr. Neville examined the effects of 56 years of pumping at 7301/s
(Initial Mine Development) as well as of 5 years pumping at 730 I/s followed by 30 years
of pumping at 1,4401/s (Expansion), assuming a specific yield of 0.15, 0.02 and 0.05,
respectively. Using a value of 0.15, the results of Mr. Neville’s analysis “approximate
closely the Shomaker results” in both scenarios. Using a value of 0.02, the drawdowns
“are significantly larger and extend well beyond the Shomaker predictions.” Specifically,
the predictions made by Mr. Neville of the drawdowns extending into Afghanistan in the

 

 

 

different scenarios he analyzed can be summarized as follows:°”*

. As Mr. Neville’s report was submitted only together with Respondent’s Rejoinder on

Quantum, Claimant’s experts did not have the opportunity to address his analysis in their
expert reports. In his direct examination at the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Drury was
presented with Appendix B to the SMEC 2010 report, on which Mr. Neville had based
his illustration of the composition of the three production wells.°’> Dr. Drury explained
why, in his opinion, the samples collected and reflected in the lithology log presented in
Appendix B do “not necessarily represent what actually is in that location’ and that he
“would not use the lithological description to apply any sort of hydrogeological aquifer
characteristic.”°”® When presented with Mr. Neville’s illustration, Dr. Drury first noted
that “it's a very generalized system because what Mr. Neville has done is, yellow is sand
and gravel, based on lithological logs, and anything which is mentioned as fine silty or
clayey is blue.” He further pointed to the screen locations in the bore which pumped 38
liters a second and explained that “[w]e don’t get that from clay material. 38 liters a
second for 21 days. So, there’s obviously something wrong between what’s shown in this
column and the screens. And this is typical of lithology logs. ... Lithology logs don’t

usually express what actually is down there.”°”

. Dr. Drury therefore disagreed with Mr. Neville’s method for determining the composition

of the sediments and stated: “What you should use is the gamma log, and the gamma log

gravels. So, if you look at the gamma log, if it moves to the left, you're getting clean
material. If it moves to the right, you're getting silty clay material.”°”* Dr. Drury then
pointed to an example where the gamma log showed very low radiation that “actually is

clean sands and gravels, even though the lithological log says silty clay and clay.” Dr.
Drury also pointed to a deviation to the other side and reiterated that “the gamma log is
what we always use in assessing the location of screens, not the lithological log” because
“it's a continuous measurement of in situ--because the probe is lowered down the hole 2
or 3 meters per minute. So, you get a continuous log of radiation. So, you can actually
see where the clays are, where the sands are by the lithological log. And it's

uncontaminated, in that it goes down the sidewall and measures what is there”???

Mr. Neville confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that he had based his analysis on a
careful review of the SMEC logs. In response to the question whether it would have been
an advantage to be on site and look at the sediments himself, he testified that while this
was generally desirable and good practice, it would not have been an advantage “if they
are drilling with mud, [because] then it's really hard to tell what is coming out when. So,
you need not an amateur like me, you need a real professional geologist to be doing the
characterization, and I assume that the SMEC logs were done by qualified professional
geologists. So, if the professional geologists says that it's clayey, then I believe it is clayey.
On the other hand, if I were standing at the drill rig and they are drilling with mud and
stuff is coming up into the mud pit, then probably I wouldn't be the best judge of what's
there.”?® Mr. Neville did not confirm, however, that drilling with mud would affect the
description in the bore log because, in his opinion, “[a] professional geologist would know
exactly what they were drilling through, and that's what it looks like they've identified

very carefully on these drilling logs.”?*!

Mr. Neville further expressed a different opinion on the relevance of gamma rays, which
he described as “a very general indicator of a clay content” which he would not use to
design well screens for which he would rather use “grain size measurements taken on-
site.” Mr. Neville did not agree that gamma rays would tell the “exact” composition of
sediments; he acknowledged that once the device was calibrated, he “would take, in a
general sense, what the gamma logs are suggesting, but [he] wouldn’t take them too
far.”°*? At the same time, Mr. Neville testified that he was using gamma rays “[a]// the
time,” considering it “a very good technique in dolostone rocks that we work with in
Southern Ontario for distinsguishing between the limestone rocks and shales” because of
the “enormous” contrast showing the change in material properties. Mr. Neville further
testified that he was not an expert in defining the contrast between sandier material and

clayey material but that, when confronted with the gamma logs for the borehole at the

Fan Sediments, he was missing a “sharp contrast” but only saw a “random signal” or a

“random variation over the length of the borehole.”?**

Mr. Jones testified at the Hearing on Quantum that the specific yield of 0.15 he used is a
“standard literature value” that he selected based on “[his] examination of the cuttings in
the field.” He stated: “I saw plenty of core screen particles. It looks to be normal
sediments to me that have a normal specific yield.” Mr. Jones clarified that he assumed
the 0.15 value based on: “My experience, my consultation of text books, my examination
of the gamma logs, examination of the core. And my experience I have is different than
the experience of field hydrogeologists in that I have studied in my models, I watched
specific yields increase in the time scale that you observe it on.”°** As to Mr. Neville’s
emphasis on the presence of clay, Mr. Jones confirmed that “[t]here is clay in the
sediments. And this idea of 2 percent specific yield is true of clay in a short-term test.
That's the water that's initially released when the clay is depressurized, but then over
time, the clay continues to be compressed and yields more water. And over a period of

years, it will yield an order of magnitude more water than 2 percent.”°*>

Based on the evidence presented by the experts, the Tribunal is not convinced of the
accuracy of Mr. Neville’s calculation regarding the amount of clayey material contained
in the Fan Sediments and of his opinion that the material at the water table, which he
considered to be particularly relevant for determining the specific yield, was primarily
clayey. Mr. Neville based his analysis on the information in the lithology log contained
in Annex B to the SMEC 2010 report. Following Dr. Drury’s explanation why the
lithology log did not necessary represent the material actually contained at a specific
depth of the borehole, Mr. Neville confirmed that when drilling with mud, it might be
difficult to tell from which depth material coming out actually stemmed, and that he
would not be able to make that determination even if he had been on site and therefore
relied on the “professional geologist’ for that purpose. As Dr. Drury was the responsible
geologist on site, the Tribunal considers his testimony that one should not rely on the
lithology log but rather on the gamma logs particularly relevant. While Mr. Neville
testified that he would not rely on gamma logs for the purposes of distinguishing between
clayey and sand/gravel materials, he confirmed that he was using gamma logs for
distinguishing other materials with a sharp contrast in their gamma radiation. In addition,
the Tribunal notes that Mr. Jones, who actually selected the specific yield, testified that
he had relied not only on gamma logs but also on his examination of the core screen
particles as well as on his 29-year experience of creating and studying groundwater
models showing that specific yields increase over time.

neither composed entirely of clay or clayey material nor that they are entirely composed
of coarse-grained material. Nevertheless, Mr. Neville considered it appropriate to apply
a specific yield that he considered to be representative of clay, i.e., as if the sediments
were 100% composed of clay. Mr. Jones, on the other hand, did not simply apply a
specific yield for coarse-grained materials as suggested by Mr. Neville. According to the
authorities relied on by Mr. Neville, sand and gravel are reported to have a specific yield
between 0.20 and 0.25 (Heath), 0.21 and 0.27 (Johnson), or 0.01 to 0.47 (Spitz and
Moreno). The Tribunal also notes that the most recent source which, according to Mr.
Neville, is based on long-term drainage experiments, reports for clay a specific yield in
the range of 0.01 and 0.18. Consequently, and regardless of the specific composition of
the material in the Fan Sediments, the Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Neville’s opinion
that a specific yield of 0.02 should have been applied to predict the effects of long-term
pumping at the Fan Sediments.

In this regard, the Tribunal also takes note of Mr. Jones’ explanation that the specific
yield of clay would increase in the long term because the clay would continue to be
depressed and actually yield more water over time. As pointed out by Claimant, this
would also be consistent with the range of 0.01 to 0.18 reported for clay based on long-
term drainage experiments. Mr. Neville testified that the long-term effect was not known
because it could not be derived from the 21-day test and “[e]verything else is speculation.”
He confirmed that it was a “reasonable assumption” that clay would drain during 56 years
of pumping when the water level sinks beneath it; he added that he therefore decided to
follow Mr. Jones’ model, maintaining, however, what he considered to a “more

representative value of the specific yield.”°*°

Mr. Jones disagreed with the criticism expressed by Mr. Neville: “We see ample core
screen sediments in here. Mr. Neville mentioned some long-term laboratory column
experiments, but actual sediments in the ground are under great pressure, and they
behave very differently. So the core screen settlements will yield, the specific yield is
something like we assumed in the short-term. The fine-grained, the clay sediments will
yield them only over long periods of time, but all of the sediments contain this quantity of

water.”°87

The Tribunal notes that there is disagreement between the experts as to whether it would
be reasonable to expect that the specific yield of clay increases in the long term. However,
on balance, i.e., also taking into account the experts’ testimony on the amount of clayey
material contained in the Fan Sediments and the authorities provided by Mr. Neville

regarding the specific yield of the different materials contained in the Fan Sediments, the
Tribunal is not convinced that Mr. Jones made an unreasonable assumption regarding the
specific yield or that a buyer would have considered that assumption overoptimistic. In
this regard, the Tribunal also notes that while Mr. Neville repeatedly emphasized that the
assumption made by Mr. Jones was not based on the results of the 21-day test because
the aquifer had remained confined during this test, Mr. Neville also made clear that he
did not consider it appropriate to assume that the aquifer would remain confined in the
long term and be limited to the much lower confined storage coefficient yielded by the
21-day test. Accordingly, Mr. Neville’s own assumption was likewise not based on these
test results but on a value derived from literature and his review of the borehole logs.
Given the detailed explanations provided by Dr. Drury and Mr. Jones as to the basis on
which the specific yield could be determined, the Tribunal concludes that the assumption
made by Mr. Jones was reasonable under the circumstances.

iv. Whether Claimant Adequately Predicted and Accounted for the
Potential Effects of Long-Term Pumping at the Fan Sediments

On that basis, the remaining question for the Tribunal to address is whether Claimant
adequately predicted the effects of long-term pumping at the Fan Sediments and whether
it appropriately accounted for potential risks associated with those effects. In his expert
report, Mr. Neville confirmed that when applying the specific yield selected by Mr. Jones,
the results of his analysis “approximate closely the Shomaker results” both for the Initial
Mine Development scenario and the Expansion scenario. In both scenarios, the analyses
conducted by both experts thus predicted that the area in which a drawdown caused by
the pumping for the Reko Diq project would exceed 3 meters would extend about 5
kilometers across the Afghan border.°**

Pakistan would have been required under customary international law to notify
Afghanistan in advance of the potential transboundary effects and further claims that
during potential subsequent discussions between the two countries, the project could not
have been developed. In support of this argument, Respondent relies on its expert Dr.
Nanni who expressed the opinion that while Pakistan is not party to the UN Watercourses
Convention, it would have been obliged under customary international water law to
observe the three “cornerstone principles” codified in the UN Watercourses Convention,
i.e., equitable and reasonable utilization, obligation not to cause significant harm and
general obligation to cooperate, and in order to ensure observance of these principles to
provide Afghanistan “with timely notification of any planned development of the size of

the Reko Dig project before the development is authorized, together with all the
documentation relating to the development, including an environmental impact
assessment.” Dr. Nanni further stated that if objections were raised, negotiations would
follow which “would likely be lengthy as the issues involved are often complex and

sometimes of a political nature.”

811. Claimant disputes that Pakistan is bound under customary international law to notify
Afghanistan and further disputes that such a notification would have had to occur at the
beginning of the project and that negotiations would have delayed the project.

812. In support of their opinion that the principles and the obligation to notify under the UN
Watercourses Convention are binding on Pakistan under international law, Respondent
and Dr. Nanni relied on the ILC Rapporteur on the Law of the non-navigational uses of
international watercourses, who considered it “reasonable to conclude on the basis of
state practice that at least three of the general principles embodied in the convention
correspond to customary norms. These are the obligations to use an international
watercourse in an equitable and reasonable manner, to use such a watercourse in such a
way as not to cause significant harm to other riparian states, and to notify potentially

affected riparian states of planned measures on an international watercourse.”??!

813. As pointed out by the ILC Rapporteur, the basis for his conclusion was an examination
of State practice. While Respondent and Dr. Nanni point to the existence of the Indus
Waters Treaty concluded between Pakistan and India in 1960 as evidence of Pakistan’s
commitment to these principles, Claimant refers to the absence of evidence that Pakistan
has ever provided Afghanistan with a notification regarding the contemplated use of
shared watercourses, including in the context of the Kabul river system. Claimant pointed
Dr. Nanni to two sections of a report on the “Water management of the Kabul River Basin
in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” which Dr. Nanni had provided with her expert report. In
the regional overview, it is stated:

“Pakistan has data on the Kabul River, but not of tributaries that flow into
the autonomous region of FATA. It does not share data on the Kabul River
with any ministries in Afghanistan. Provincial governments in border areas
do not exchange hydrological data or meet with their trans-boundary
counterparts to discuss water-related issues, according to our investigations
in Paktia, Khost and Kunar provinces in Afghanistan and Baluchistan and
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan.”

814. In the section of precedents for collaboration, it is further stated:

“Afghanistan’s recent parallel agreements and_ discussions with
neighbouring states are worth noting because the absence of a treaty with
Pakistan is often attributed to Afghanistan’s lack of internal capacity. The
failure to collaborate in the last decade can equally be seen as a collateral
effect of bad relations between the two countries.

Despite declarations made by both Afghan and Pakistani leaders at the
Islamabad Conference of 2009 to strengthen relations, collaboration has not
materialised in the water sector. Engineers on both sides of the Af-Pak border
confirm they do not share any hydrological data with their riparian partner,
nor are there any joint flood-protection strategies or joint dam feasibility
studies.”°?

. When confronted with these statements, Dr. Nanni maintained that to her understanding,

“they are trying to come together with Afghanistan parties to start discussions on the
possibility to agree on the Kabul.” In response to the question whether she agreed that the
practice of Pakistan and Afghanistan showed that they do not consider that they have a
customary law obligation to notify each other and to cooperate, Dr. Nanni further stated:

“T'm not sure it's universal--it can be stated like this: The two countries are

now--specifically, Pakistan is experiencing a difficult period. There is

animosity between the two countries that I think I mentioned in my Report.

There is contention created by the Durand Line established by the British.

So, there is this type of relationship. But I believe that, eventually, this all will

end up with fruitful cooperation and an agreement.”°*
Dr. Nanni also stated that she was not aware of Pakistan having provided a notification
for use of a groundwater source to Afghanistan or to Iran with which Pakistan shares the
Upper Tahlab aquifer being used to supply the Saindak mine.””> The Tribunal is aware
that Dr. Nanni also noted that this factual question had not been within the scope of her
current research. However, taking into account the apparent lack of cooperation between
Pakistan and Afghanistan with regard to the Kabul river basin and in the absence of any
evidence that Pakistan considers itself bound by customary international law to provide
Afghanistan or Iran with notification of the contemplated use of a shared water source,
the Tribunal is not convinced that Pakistan would have considered itself under an
obligation to provide such notification with regard to Claimant’s contemplated use of the
Fan Sediments.

In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that as Dr. Nanni confirmed during the Hearing on
Quantum, the examples of agreements on groundwater sources she had provided

concerned very large aquifer systems with a large number of users.”°° By contrast, the
Fan Sediments had no users because, as Claimant submitted and Respondent did not
dispute, the water was not potable and not suitable for irrigation or agricultural use.
According to Mr. Mayer, this aspect formed an important consideration for Claimant’s
decision to develop the Fan Sediments as its primary water source:
“I made this decision after consultation with the experts conducting the water
studies, in-house Barrick experts, the permitting team, project team members,
and management. This decision was supported by the following
considerations: 1) the indication of sufficient water supply from the pre-
feasibility studies; 2) the absence of existing groundwater users from the Fan
Sediments aquifer in Pakistan; 3) the depth of the groundwater in the area
targeted for development making physical access to Fan Sediments aquifer
water difficult; 4) the poor quality of the groundwater, which is not suitable
for human consumption, livestock, or agriculture; and 5) the suitability of the
water-quality for use in the beneficiation process for the mine.”
As an additional consideration, the Tribunal considers it relevant that, in the Initial Mine
Development scenario, Mr. Jones’ groundwater model predicted the first drawdown at
the Afghan border to occur after 30 years of pumping and the maximum drawdown of
about five meters to occur 17 years after the end of mining.*”* In the Expansion scenario,
the model predicted the maximum drawdown at the Afghan border to occur 20 years after
the end of mining; Mr. Jones did not state at what point in time the first drawdown at the
Afghan border would occur.?”

Respondent maintains that Claimant “would have caused transboundary effects in the
short term,” i.e., already during the three-year construction phase, and relies on Mr.
Neville’s testimony that “[alfter 21 days, the aquifer responded as if it were still confined,
so the responses would actually be observed relatively quickly.”'°°’ However, as noted
above, Mr. Neville did not testify that he actually expected the aquifer to remain confined
in the long term but rather followed Mr. Jones’ assumption that it would be unconfined
and only disagreed with the specific yield assumed by Mr. Jones. Mr. Neville further
specifically stated that he did not investigate the “question of timing” but rather “looked
at the long-term results,” i.e., at the “end of operations.” When asked whether he could
give an opinion on the timing, he made the statement quoted by Respondent “if J limited

myself to just that data’ and otherwise noted that “beyond the 21 days, we’re all

speculating.”'°!

820. On that basis, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that any drawdown into
Afghanistan would have occurred only several years or even decades into the future. The
Tribunal has taken note of Dr. Nanni’s testimony that she would still provide a
notification to a neighboring State even if it was known that the effects would occur only
30 years into the future in order to place “the other countries in the position to opt for an
exit strategy.”'°°? While the Tribunal appreciates Dr. Nanni’s opinion that this is a “very
important issue,” the Tribunal does not find it convincing that notice would have to be
given decades in advance before it was known whether and to what extent any effect
would occur. In particular, given Dr. Nanni’s explanation that the notification should
include information regarding the possible adverse effects, it does not appear plausible to
the Tribunal that notice should be given at such an early point in time and before it was
known, e.g., whether and, if so, when the expansion scenario would materialize.

821.

Finally, the Tribunal also notes that Claimant was considering the use of mitigation
measures in order to avoid or mitigate any impact across the Afghan border. As Dr. Drury
explained during his direct examination, the drawdown could have been mitigated by a
“mythical aquifer injection, which is, basically, you actually engineer the aquifer by
injecting water into the aqua system in a location where it is sensitive. So, if you've got
water levels drawing down and you don't want the water level to extend beyond a certain
point, you can actually inject water in bores, across a line. And so, the bores--so the water
level on the outside of the injection is still steady state, but on the inside, drawdown still
occurs.” Dr. Drury noted that SMEC had recommended this mitigation measure in its
2009 report and “that trial has been carried out.” According to Dr. Drury, it is a “very
common” measure which he had also used for Barrick Coal in Bangladesh and
Oakland’coal mine. !°°3

822. Mr. Mayer stated, in response to the question whether he looked into the costs and
feasibility of the option to use aquifer injection and its suitability to avoid the issue of
entering into the Afghanistan aquifer: “Yeah. It is something that, against, it was proposed
as a possible mitigation measure, if required. And so the process would be the Feasibility
Study's done, we have the project definition, we have our cones of depression. Those
cones go to the environmental and permitting group, and they would come back with a
recommendation that we would need to find a mitigation strategy. But as far as is it
feasible? It certainly is, and it would require ... injecting water along a line or, you know,

even infiltrating water along a series of trenches to basically just create a little mound of
water.”!°°4 Mr. Mayer further confirmed that this option was still under consideration at
the time the SMEC feasibility report was completed. He added that “after this study we
would have gone forward with the recommendations. I think there were other
recommendations outside of that. I think there was to drill some deeper holes and other
things that SMEC had proposed, and those things would have taken place in that next
phase of work we had planned, which was the ... EPCM phase.” Mr. Mayer stated that
he did not have a cost estimate for this solution but stated that “it would not be a large
cost, you know, in comparison to the ... cost of the Project.” Referring to the estimate for
development of the Fan Sediments of USD 95 million, he stated that they had
“contingency within the estimate that would cover off, you know, this.”'°°° Mr. Mayer
then explained:

“What generally happens is you agree to monitoring and generally like
triggers. ... You develop the groundwater model and--with the information
that's available, and we had quite a bit of information here with the testing--
and that model makes projections and it--most likely a system, a trigger and
mitigation system would have been developed based on the model projections.

And then monitoring would be put in place and we would actually monitor.
Not based on a model, but actually monitoring levels. We would monitor
levels, and the levels got to a point where the agreed-upon triggers were, then
it usually goes: Increase the frequency of monitoring, develop mitigations
system, implement mitigation system, generally, like three triggers such as
that. That is typically how it is done.

... And the last bit of that is that we would update the model like probably
early on every quarter, take the information that we collect from the pumping
and look at it, update the model and, you know, depending on if it's on or off,
if it's doing pretty good, you know, we'd decrease the frequency of that.

So, yeah, and typically ... what would happen, again, you know, is that, if the
... permitting side never got to the point of recommending that the cross-
border issue required mitigation, okay.

If they--and I'm not saying is that that was a final decision or anything. I just
think that things were cut short before that decision was arrived at. But if it
was an issue, then the trigger system would be developed and the mitigation
issues would have been developed, you know. And I'd put it this way, you
know.

As far as costs go, it would not be a large cost, you know, and it wouldn't be-
-it would be a small amount of water that we'd have to inject. But

comparatively of having to go off to Tahlab or Patangaz or Hamun or the

. Mr. Neville testified that while he did not consider mitigation measures in his expert

report, there were “a few big issues” regarding aquifer injection, such as where the water
would come from and how much the water would have to be treated before reinjecting it.
He stated that “there’s a long history of unsuccessful reinjections systems” because “wells
clog usually very rapidly” and “very elaborate water treatment” is needed. He noted that
“these systems require a lot of care and feeding” in that they have to be monitored
carefully over the long term and concluded that “when you look in the literature, you see

as many successful implementations of groundwater reinjections as you don’t.”'°

Dr. Drury confirmed that there is a “maintenance issue” but maintained that there are
“some very, very successful aquifer injection systems” and expressed the opinion that
“[t]he ones which fail are the ones which are normally poorly run.” Dr. Drury further
testified that “[b]ased on experience elsewhere,” he assumed that the cost for an injection
solution would be “in the $10 to $20 million range” but noted that “it has not been costed”
and “it’s not inexpensive. And there’s also a long-term monitoring and maintenance
program, so you need people employed to carry out the maintenance program as

well.?71010

Based on the testimony of the experts, the Tribunal considers it established that aquifer
injection was considered as a potential mitigation measure at the time, which could have
been employed if and when it turned out that there would be a considerable impact on
Afghanistan territory. In the Tribunal’s view, this supports the conclusion that a potential
drawdown into Afghanistan would not have prevented Claimant from using water from
the Fan Sediments. On the other hand, Mr. Mayer and Dr. Drury confirmed that no cost
estimate was included for this potential mitigation measure. While Mr. Mayer considered
that the cost would have been included in the cost estimate of USD 95 million for the
development of the Fan Sediments, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by this
testimony, given that Dr. Drury stated that the solution could have increased costs by
USD 10-20 million and there would have been additional cost for the maintenance
program. It should be noted, however, that the 11% contingency on the overall capital
costs included an 11.75% contingency regarding off site fresh water, i.e., an amount of
USD 11.3 million.!°!!

826. As noted above, the residual risk register included the risk that a “lender requires the
project to engage in cross border consultations with Afghanistan due to the Fan
Sediments water supply.”'°'? However, this risk was assigned only an opex impact but no
capex impact and apparently did not include the possibility that Claimant might have to
install a monitoring and/or mitigation system.

827. In addition, Claimant identified the following risks to which it had not assigned an capex
or opex estimate: (i) “Cross border consultation & mitigation in Afghanistan caused by
the use of water sources resulting in schedule delay and/or community/government
opposition or demands’, and (ii) “Water usage by project causes drawdowns that have
impact in [Iran / Afghanistan] resulting in diplomatic challenges.”!°'? As for the first risk,
Claimant was planning to mitigate it through a potential “ground-truthing” field
inspection of the affected area in Afghanistan; if impacts turned out to be negligible, it
would notify the relevant authorities and if they were significant, it would “perform public
consultation and develop mitigation/compensation.” It was noted that the risk rating was
“based on reputational or regulatory consequences, not financial or operational.”!°'4

Prof. Davis incorporated this risk into his model as a risk that could cause project start-

up delay.'°'5 As for the second risk, Claimant referred to the development and

implementation of a community and government relations strategy; the action step

“Confirm that water drawdowns in Afghanistan are minimal’ was marked as

completed.!°!® Accordingly, Prof. Davis recorded this risk as “not material.”!°!"

828. In the Tribunal’s view, this confirms that Claimant did not include the costs of having to
install a monitoring and/or mitigation system because it had concluded that the predicted
water drawdown in Afghanistan would be “minimal” and thus did not anticipate at the
time that there was a significant risk of having to implement these mitigation measures.
While this risk assessment may have changed in the future, the Tribunal is not convinced
that, based on the information available as of the valuation date, a buyer would have
reached a different conclusion and required the addition of further contingency to account
for the possibility of having to mitigate drawdowns in Afghanistan.

829. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that neither of the issues raised by Respondent
would have affected the feasibility of Claimant’s plan for the supply of water to the
project. While it appears to the Tribunal that Claimant has not accounted for the potential
extra costs associated with having to implement an aquifer injection system to mitigate
possible drawdown effects into Afghanistan, the Tribunal does not consider that this

Whether Claimant Has Established That It Had a Feasible Plan for Dealing with the
Security Concerns Raised by Respondent

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that it “fully recognized and addressed the relevant security risks,
including those associated with transporting the slurry concentrate by pipeline to the port
of Gwadar.”!°!8

Claimant refers to the chapters on security and risk included in both the Feasibility Study
and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study as well as the “comprehensive Risk Register in
which risks were catalogued, assigned a mitigation strategy, and tracked with respect to
progress.”!°'? According to Claimant, the costs associated with the security plans were
accounted for in the operating and capital cost estimates, with “significant contingencies

totaling more than half a billion dollars” built into the capital expense estimates. !°”°

Claimant notes that based on the documentary record and the testimony of Mr. Livesey,
the Tribunal held in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that “it is plausible that not
all risks can be fully assessed and quantified at such an early stage of the project and that
the risk mitigation strategy evolves over time and the further development of the project.
Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason to assume a failure on the part of TCCP to
adequately address security risks in the Feasibility Study.”!°?! In Claimant’s view,
Respondent is attempting to recycle the same arguments, which the Tribunal has already

rejected in the liability phase. !°?*

Claimant emphasizes that Respondent’s expert Mr. Davies confirmed in his expert report
that Claimant’s security plan for the central facilities at Reko Diq was “acceptable” and
that mining operations could have proceeded with a “significant but tolerable level of risk
after mitigation had been implemented.” He further considered that the security budget
for the central facilities “appears to be appropriate” and noted that “[m]any of these
measures are in-line with what would be expected of an operating company at this stage
of the project cycle.”'© Claimant also refers to its own expert Mr. Ridley, who led the

International SOS Security Risk Assessment in 2006 and, after again visiting the site and
reviewing Mr. Davies’ critique, concluded that “TCC’s security plan was workable,
within expectations and financially viable.” Claimant also emphasizes that the 2006
assessment was carried out before any mitigation measures and determined that “[d]espite
the fact that Pakistan represents a significant risk to specific assets and business
operations, strategic planning and supported procedures will ensure a permissible

operations environment for businesses.” '°?>

834. With regard to the contemplated slurry concentrate pipeline, Claimant notes that it
decided to use the pipeline based on “extensive trade-off studies showing that a slurry
pipeline would be both the safest and most economical option.” Claimant refers to the
Bankable Feasibility Report prepared by Pipeline Systems Inc. (PSI), which was based,
inter alia, on an in-person survey of the pipeline route and expressly included security
considerations in the design of the pipeline, such as that the pipeline would be entirely
underground and avoid sensitive areas.'°?° Claimant quotes from Mr. Mayer who
supervised the work carried out by PSI and concluded that “[t]he Bankable Feasibility
Report exceeds what I would expect from a pipeline bankable feasibility design study,
and is consistent with design studies I have approved and gone on to execute for other

pipeline projects.”'°77

835. Claimant emphasizes that Mr. Davies did not present any example of an attack ona slurry
pipeline but only relied on case studies regarding oil and gas pipelines. According to
Claimant, these present “fundamentally different security risks” as they are more
vulnerable to attack than a slurry concentrate pipeline because they: (i) “tend to be above
ground, or are buried only a few inches below the surface, making them easy to locate
and access along their entire length;” (ii) “they contain flammable materials that magnify
the effect of any explosion’; (iii) “[r]epairs are often costly and lengthy’; and (iv) there is
an “economic incentive for those able to steal the contents.”'°® Specifically with regard
to the “politically charged” Sui gas pipeline in Balochistan, Claimant also refers to Mr.
Livesey’s testimony that “the Sui has [sic] pipeline and the rest of the gas infrastructure
in Balochistan does not pay any royalty or revenue to Balochistan itself, so it’s naturally
a target because it’s seen by the Balochis as being a non-Balochi project. It’s being seen

as something that is not adding value to them necessarily.”'°° By contrast, Claimant
argues that the slurry pipeline would be an “unlikely target for Baloch nationalist attack”
as it would run exclusively through Baloch territory and transport slurry of a project in

which Balochistan would have held a 25% participation. !°*°

By contrast, Claimant contends that there would have been “no real incentive” for
insurgents to attack the slurry concentrate pipeline because: (i) the pipeline would be
“difficult to locate, access, or breach,” taking into account the desert environment and
Claimant’s army patrols, the small size of the pipeline and its burial “several feet
underground” as well as its “flexible composition of high density polyethylene lined
carbon steel enveloping slurry in a cylindrical container”; and (ii) any damage would
cause “minimal, if any, downtime” as the pipeline would be easier to repair than an oil
and gas pipeline due to its simple design and, once a breach would be detected through
an electronic monitoring system, the concentrate flow could be discontinued so that
“little, if any, of the procduct would be lost.”'' Claimant also argues that the slurry
concentrate would be “almost commercially useless to anyone but TCC” because it would

have to be refined at appropriate facilities which are “in short supply” in Balochistan. °°?

Claimant notes that the assessments made by Mr. Mayer and Mr. Ridley are supported by
the experience with an above-ground slurry concentrate pipeline in Indonesia, which was
“repaired and restored promptly after an attack.” Claimant quotes from an OPIC
Memorandum reporting that after an attack with a hacksaw on adjacent slurry and fuel
pipelines, “within a few hours both pipelines had been repaired and returned to full
operation,” and after a separate attack, “repairs were completed and the pumping of slurry
was resumed” the following afternoon and “no slurry was lost through that pipeline.”

According to Claimant, the financial impact of the disrutption was thus “minimal.”!°%

Claimant notes that Mr. Davies referred in his second report to the “aggregated
consequences of disruption” and agreed during the Hearing on Quantum that the main
motivation of any insurgent would be to cause downtime and thus financial damage.
Therefore, Claimant maintains that “the sheer difficulties of causing any disruption, and
the minimal economic impact of any such disruption, would have rendered the

concentrate pipeline an unattractive target.” '°*

839. Claimant further claims that the “low risk of an occasional disruption of the slurry
pipeline with its minimal finciancial impact” would have been preferable over the annual
cost of USD 20.5 million for the 6,820 man-force proposed by Mr. Davies to guard the
pipeline. In any event, however, Claimant emphasizes that even that cost together with
the other security measures proposed by Mr. Davies woud not have rendered the project
uneconomic. It refers to its expert Prof. Davis, who calculated that the proposed security
costs would have reduced the value of the project from USD 8.5 billion to USD 8.1
billion, without accounting for the reduced probability of shutdowns and interruptions
that would have resulted from these increased mitigation measures, and confirmed that

“[t]he project could easily support the additional costs and remain valuable.” !°>

840. Claimant submits that based on PSI’s design of the pipeline, it evaluated and created
mitigation plans for the remaining security risks and quotes from Mr. Ridley’s opinion
that “TCC adequately considered and addressed the existing, relevant and foreseeable
security threats specific to the contemplated slurry concentrate pipeline,’ and that
Claimant’s approach “was consistent with international standards and related hierarchy
of controls, which in turn contributed to the security risks being minimised as far as

reasonably practicable.”'*6

841.

With regard to Respondent’s reliance on a statement in the PSI report that “[n]o safety
and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues related to
Pakistan,” Claimant refers to Mr. Livesey’s testimony that PSI is “not a pipeline security
company, so the security risk issues are transferred across to security which, primarily
for this project was handled by Barrick’s global security VP and his team in Toronto.
And it was input from them that added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the
Feasibility Study under G&A.”'°*” Claimant submits that its security plan involved
strategic partnerships with Balochistan and a “network of relationships with service
infrastructure providers and the socio-economic participants’ and notes that the
Feasibility Study also set out that “[t]e concentrate pipeline route, choke and valve
stations, and Panjgur drivers’ rest stop will be patrolled by a light truck, a driver, and a
guard on 24 h/d, 7 d/w basis. The three stations will be monitored by CCTV and access
control and alarm systems.”'°* Claimant also emphasizes that its security plan would

have continued to evolve over time adapting to changing circumstances and accounting

for factors such as new technology throughout the life of the project.

842. According to Claimant, the cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study were
“commensurate with the known information and pre-operational stage of the project.”
Claimant contends that “normal security costs and precautions” were included in PSI’s
estimate and “extraordinary” security costs were addressed in other sections of the
Feasibility Study. Specifically, Claimant refers to the Concentrate Transportation Trade-
Off Study prepared by SLI which “included the costs for the excluded items,” including
“[e]xtraordinary security for Stations or Pipeline and associated facilities.”' Claimant
submits that based on the recommendation of the recommendation of Barrick’s Senior
Vice President & Operations Officer Mr. Wall and his team, “an additional layer of
security precautions and costs, such as alarm systems, CCTV monitoring and patrolling
vehicles and Chokidars was added to PSI’s initial recommendations” the costs of which
are reflected in the capital and operating expense estimates of the Feasibility Study.!%!

843. By contrast, Claimant considers the cost estimates provided by Mr. Davies “exaggerated
and unrealistic,” arguing that they are exclusively based on case studies which do not
include any example from the mining sector and ignore specific characteristics of the
area. Claimant quotes from Mr. Ridley’s opinion that “S-RM’s unscientific process
resulted in vastly inflated cost estimates, which are divorced from the realities on the

ground and offer no useful comparison.”' Specifically with regard to the estimate of

USD 20.5 million in OPEX for 6,800 men to guard the pipeline, Claimant notes that Mr.

Davies himself admits that this “might appear to be a grossly inflated figure” and

acknowledges that Claimant could use less manpower if it used surveillance technology

and a detection and alerting system for which Mr. Davies also included a cost estimate of

USD 1.5-2 million.!°

844. As for Mr. Davies’ estimate of USD 20-25 million for security hardware to protect the
central production facilities, Claimant argues that this would not have been necessary and
in even counter-productive and submits that Mr. Davies in any event did not provide
sufficient information to show how he arrived at that figure.!044 In Claimant’s view, the
same applies to Respondent’s reliance on “security challenges” of the Saindak mine,

which according to Claimant, in any event has taken a “profoundly different approach to
security than that adopted by TCC,” with a history of negative community relations and

the use of a “disproportionate security force” which worsened its security situation. !°4°

Finally, Claimant emphasizes that Respondent did not raise any security-related concerns
about Claimant’s pipeline plans prior to this arbitration even though the GOB was
informed about the pipeline as an option as early as December 2007. Claimant also refers
to Respondent’s plans starting at the end of 2010 to construct a natural gas pipeline which,
in Claimant’s view, would have been more vulnerable to attack than the proposed slurry
pipeline. With regard to the Sui gas pipeline invoked by Respondent, Claimant notes that
the company continues to operate profitably and expand its pipeline network, which it

considers as evidence of the viability of its slurry concentrate pipeline.!°

In any event, Claimant contends that Prof. Davis’ model “fully accounts for any security
costs.” Specifically, Claimant refers to Prof. Davis’ inclusion of a 0.5% annual likelihood
of permanent pre-mature mine shut-down of Reko Diq due to acts of extreme political
violence, which, according to Prof. Davis, “reduces the value of the investment by US$
1.4 billion, or 14% relative to a scenario where this risk would be absent.”!°7 According
to Claimant, this is “an extremely conservative assumption” given that Mr. Davies
acknowledged that there is little risk that potential attacks would permanently shut down
operations. Claimant also argues that Prof. Davis’ 0.5% probability has a “strong
evidentiary basis” as it is derived from the market pricing of political violence insurance
provided by OPIC and conservatively uses the “high end of the rate range.” Claimant
rejects the arguments raised by Respondent’s experts and maintains that OPIC rates are
“true market rates” and “the best indication of the underlying probability of political
violence occurring,” regardless of whether or not Claimant would have been able to
actually buy OPIC insurance.'* Claimant also dismisses Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof.
Wells’ reference to the separate insurance for business income as irrelevant because even
if an investor were to pay an additional premium, “the probability and hence rate charged
for political violence insurance should not change,” as confirmed by the fact that the rates
for the insurance of assets and business income are the same.!°

Claimant further rejects that the analysis made by Dr. Burrows in his second report based
on Pakistan’s sovereign yield spread reflects the political risk in Pakistan as the spread
includes numerous risks that are inapplicable to the project. Claimant also refers to the
scholarly papers on which Dr. Burrows relied in his analysis and contends that confirm

that the method is improper for the present purposes. Claimant considers this confirmed
by the fact that the country risks ratings relied on by Dr. Burrows have stayed nearly
constant during the investment period while Pakistan’s sovereign yield spread “has varied
widely for reasons unrelated to political risk.”'°° Claimant also notes that it requested
the full underlying data and regression analysis allegedly performed by Dr. Bekaert and
was provided with a partial response which revealed that the analysis was produced before
Dr. Burrows’ first report. In any event, Claimant submits that the document produced by
Respondent does not contain the underlying data or explain the method used by Dr.
Bekaert for his regression analysis, thereby preventing Prof. Davis from fully testing it.
According to Claimant, the Tribunal should therefore not give any weight to this

analysis. !°!

In Claimant’s view, the Hearing on Quantum raised further questions undermining the
reliability of the analysis as the 2015 paper co-authored by Dr. Bekaert did not contain
the data used in the regression analysis but Dr. Burrows initially testified that he had
relied on an earlier paper from 2014 and then claimed that Dr. Bekaert had updated the
model for him, which apparently produced “completely different” results from the results

presented in the 2015 paper.!°>

Claimant also refers to Prof. Davis’ testimony that based on the data he received and
tested, “the model doesn’t work for Pakistan” but is “off roughly 100 percent, on
average.” Claimant also refers to Prof. Davis’ illustration of the lack of correspondence
between Pakistan’s sovereign yield spread and political risk which “move completely
independent from each other” and demonstrate that “[t]he sovereign spread is moving

around for reasons other than political risk.”'°?

In addition to the 0.5% annual probability, Claimant notes that Prof. Davis incorporated
into his model the risks included in the risk register, which included risks raised by Mr.
Davies as well as “many” risks that he failed to identify.!° Claimant refers to
“substantial premiums” for insurance protecting against the effects of political violence,
terrorist attacks, and other security threats in the total amount of nearly USD 9 million
per year and adjustments made by Prof. Davis to reflect the residual risk of various

security threats reducing the cash flows by USD 13.9 million per year during the first five

years of operations and USD 5.7 million per year thereafter.'°°

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

851. Respondent considers it undisputed that Claimant was planning to build a mine in “one
of the most dangerous places in the world” and that the security situation in Balochistan
has worsened from 2006 to 2011 and continuing thereafter. However, Respondent
contends that Claimant “made little to no effort to identify and address the security risks
that the Reko Dig project faced, largely ignored the threat of sabotage on the pipeline,

and completely understated the costs to adequately secure the mine’s operations.” !°°°

852. Respondent notes that Balochistan’s political and security context is described as “hellish

complexity” and that the political risk in Pakistan is referred to as “Extreme.”!°°7
Respondent also refers to its expert Prof. Rais who outlined the dangers posed by
Balochistan’s geographical location located between Afghanistan and Iran, with the
Chagai district being a known smuggling corridor, as well as the presence of Taliban and
other militant groups which have been linked to a growing number of violent attacks and
the fact that only 5% of Balochistan are under police control. Respondent notes that
Claimant has not disputed the data regarding the number of attacks or Prof. Rais’
description of the sources of conflicts in the region and the increased incidents or
violence.'!°* Respondent further explains that the conflict in Balochistan is multi-
dimensional and that there would not have been any single group or authority with whom
Claimant could have negotiated on the slurry pipeline; in addition, the communities are
not necessarily receptive to Western models of community investment and
development.!°?

853. Respondent claims that none of the documents to which Claimant has pointed in this
arbitration support that Claimant adequately considered and addressed the security risks
for the project. According to Respondent, none of the cited trade-off studies directly

address security risks and Mr. Ridley’s “independent” security assessment in 2006

“completely ignored” the security risks and mitigation plans for the slurry pipeline.!°°

Similarly, Respondent submits that the contingency in the Feasibility Study to which
Claimant has pointed does not make reference to security issues but rather, by its own
definition, addresses only technical engineering issues and unit costs, and specifically
excludes “labour disputes, change in scope or price escalation.”*! As for the chapter on

security, Respondent argues that it “only superficially deals with security for the
1062

pipeline,” which is focused on theft and fraud and not on acts of sabotage or terrorism.
Respondent further notes that the socio-economic baseline conducted along the transport
corridors, including the pipeline route, referred to “security related considerations, more
specifically the hostility of the local people towards outsiders” as a limitation to the study
as well as “limited police presence in the surveyed villages along the transport

corridor.” 1°

854. As for Claimant’s reference to its Risk Register, Respondent acknowledges that it “at
least mentions security issues” but maintains that it “underscores TCC’s almost flippant
approach.” In Respondent’s view, the mitigation measures identified in response to the
highest security are ineffective given that the residual risk rating following mitigation is
still high and the likelihood of the threat occurring remains the same.'°°* Respondent
further claims that Claimant fails to account for the impact to CAPEX and OPEX for most
of the risks, including the highest security risks (SECO1, SECO3, SECOS and SEC08),

and fails to accurately add up the impact of unmitigated exposure in its risk register.!0°

855. Respondent contends that Claimant “only planned to secure the central mining site to a
minimum adequate level, avoiding best practices while leaving other areas of the mining

operations vulnerable,” in particular the pipeline as a “critical infrastructure piece” to

bring the concentrate out of the country.!°

856. Acording to Respondent, the pipeline is “the greatest weakness of the project” but the
Feasibility Study is “almost dismissive of the threat.” With regard to Claimant’s plan to
secure the pipeline, Respondent notes that Claimant originally estimated 730 FC
personnel to provide security for the project but decided to “drastically cut to 200 FC
personnel without further explanation.” While noting that the original estimate pre-dated
the decision to transport the copper concentrate via pipeline, Respondent maintains that
Claimant should instead have increased the number following its decision to use a
pipeline, due to the “dramatically” increased footprint of project which went through the

“highest threat areas.”!°°' In Respondent’s view, both the water suppy pipeline and the
slurry pipeline would have been “vulnerable to even rudimentary attacks” and thus have

presented opportunity that would have drawn insurgents from the region. !°*

Respondent also presents what it describes as “some selected examples of negative
attitudes expressed towards TCC’s plans by a diverse range of actors,” such as protests
against the hiring of non-locals over locals for the Reko Diq project in 2008 and against
the dismissal of local workers in 2009 and 2011 as well as several petitions filed with the
Pakistan Supreme Court regarding the GOB’s collaboration with Claimant. Respondent
also considers that Claimant made “elementary errors” leading to “very negative
perception within the communities” in the context of hiring people from outside the local

area and declining to meet with local tribes along the pipeline route.!°°

Respondent argues that the pipeline is an attractive target for insurgents. Referring to its
expert Mr. Davies, Respondent submits that “the history of attacks on Balochistan’s
infrastructure projects and transportation corridors make it highly likely that the pipeline
would have been targeted” and further contends that the pipeline would go through some
of the most dangerous districts in Pakistan. Respondent refers to videos of attacks in
Balochistan it has submitted as evidence which demonstrate in its view that insurgents
were capable and had the intention to conduct sabotage and inflict maximum damage. !°”°
In Respondent’s view, the video also demonstrates that the GOB’s involvement in the
project might actually increase the attractiveness as a target given the tension between the
nationalist groups and the States and as evidenced by attacks on government-owned
pipelines such as the Sui gas pipeline.!°’! Respondent also refers to security issues faced
by PSI during its trip to survey the pipeline route and an attack on Claimant’s community
relations team during a field trip on ESIA related work.!°7

In response to Claimant’s arguments, Respondent submits that: (i) the pipeline would be
easy detect given the planned installation of above-ground markers and burial offers
insufficient protection; (ii) the material of the pipeline would be no different from those
used in oil and gas pipelines and Claimant was not planning to encase the pipeline in

concrete over its entire length or to use reinforced concrete and, therefore the pipeline
would not be “particularly blast resistant” to withstand the explosives used by insurgents
in Balochistan; and (iii) pipeline repairs would not be as simple as Claimant has stated

given the security issues preventing technical teams from making the repairs. !°

860. Respondent also rejects the argument that oil and gas pipelins are more susceptible to
attacks because of their content and argues that “the primary driving force of the attacks
is not to steal the contents, but to sabotage operations,” which would make Claimant’ s
slurry pipeline “just as susceptible to delays and financial loss.” Respondent
acknowledges that “there have been more incidents involving gas and oil pipelines” but
maintains that this is due to the fact that “it is a more established industry with more
pipelines and greater opportunity for sabotage.”'°" In addition, Respondent argues that
while the copper concentrate may not be flammable as oil and gas “the end result is not
much different when an attack occurs” with regard to delays and downtime impacting

operations. !°7>

861.

Respondent contends that Claimant failed to fully account for these security risks,
including the aggregate impact on the mining operation, and thereby also prevented “any
accurate determination of TCC’s tolerance level to withstand repeated attacks.” It further
refers to Mr. Davies’ testimony that these types of attacks have caused other commercial
operations to be halted for long periods or suspended indefinitely.'°”° Again referring to
Mr. Davies, Respondent submits that in this environment, the question is not if but when

an attack might occur.!077

862. Respondent alleges that Claimant’s security plans were “outdated, missing information,

and generally incomplete,” given that: (i) the SOS International assessment in 2006
undisputedly did not evaluate the pipeline route or security threats at Port Gwadar and no
supplemental risk assessment was prepared to address these issues or the increasing level
of separatist insurgent activity between 2007 and 2011; (ii) Mr. Ridley could not confirm
that the Hearing on Quantum that Claimant’s international security documents complied
with the relevant ISO 31000 standards, stating that he was “no actually making a summary
judgment as to the overall ISO 31000 as it pertains to TCC” and Mr. Ridley received only
“some” of the “weekly” security reports and testified that he would not be surprised if an
attack of Claimant’s own personnel would not be included in these reports which,

according to Respondent, renders them “essentially useless.”!°7

According to
Respondent, the security documents contain “further flaws, almost too many to address
in the space allotted’ and Claimant “could never have expected a third-party buyer to

accept the security situation, plans, or costs as reflected in TCC’s documents.” !°7

863. As to the costs included by Claimant for its security plans, Respondent alleges that they
are “‘so paltry as to be embarrassing.” Referring to Mr. Davies, Respondent contends that
the Feasibility Study does not include adequate security costs for the pipeline and notes
that the pipeline’s feasibility study expressly excludes security cost, stating that “[n]o
safety and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues related
to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood to provide a better cost estimate for this
important task.” PSI further stated in the CAPEX estimate that it “does not include any
extraordinary provisions for security either during construction of the facilities described
here or for the completed facilities after construction of for [sic] day to day operations.”
Respondent further submits that while Claimant insisted that these costs are included in
other sections of the Feasibility Study, it has not been able to point to a specific page
showing the amount. Specifically with regard to the “extraordinary” security costs
recorded in Chapter 19 on Security, Respondent claims these are “simply a CCTV
monitoring system and security access system at each of the three pumping stations,

leaving hundreds of kilometers of the pipeline in between unsecured.” !°*

864. In response to Mr. Livesey’s testimony that security costs for the pipeline are reflected in
various budgetary items, Respondent maintains that it is impossible to tell from these
budgets how security is included in these general headings. Respondent also notes that
G&A for OPEX includes one item addressing security which amounts to USD 2.5 million
per year to secure the entire project. In Respondent’s view, this is insufficient.!°*! In
addition, Respondent notes that Claimant did not assign any CAPEX or OPEX impact to

the “likely” risk of “a direct violent attack in-country by any hostile force” even though

Mr. Cusworth stated that it should be assigned an impact before and after mitigation. !°°?

865. Respondent refers to an estimate of Mr. Davies who recommends that approximately
6,820 security personnel to provide a high level of resilience and estimates that the
following costs would be necessary: (i) approximately USD 20-25 million in CAPEX for
the necessary security hardware to protect the central facilities; (ii) an additional USD
13.68 million in CAPEX for the necessary vehicles support for the pipeline’s armed
manpower teams; and (iii) approximately USD 20.52 million per year in OPEX for the
necessary manpower to ensure pipeline security.'°*? Respondent considers that this
number is “not overwhelming force” and confirmed by the example of a proposed pipeline
running through Afghanistan that would be protected by similar manpower.!°%+

According to Respondent, Claimant’s security budget did not reflect any of these costs,

which reduce Claimant’s valuation by almost USD 400 million, nor did it give

consideration to alternative technologies for securing the pipeline or the costs associated
with the downtime caused by potential attacks.'°*° Respondent clarifies that downtime is
also not accounted for in Mr. Davies’ estimate, nor did he seek to determine the costs of

“inevitable delays that would have occurred in the start-up of the security effort.”'°°

866. In Respondent’s view, the important point is that Claimant has not conducted “a thorough
assessment to allow a determination of the project’s tolerance level for aggregate losses
that it would suffer from multiple attacks.” In the absence of an adequate risk mitigation

plan, Respondent considers it a “completely reasonable approach” for Mr. Davies to
resort to case studies from similar threat environments. !°°7

867. Respondent further points to the Saindak mine which, in its view, “has been able to run
a mining operation in Balochistan because it has limited its footprint to a mangeable
area, avoided pipeline transport all together, and ensured community engagement and
participation in the project.” Respondent also notes that it is primarily a socio-economic
project of the GOB which “naturally gives a higher tolerance level than a purely
commercial operation” with only a minority interest of the GOB in a portion of the
resource. Despite these differences, Respondent submits that Saindak has suffered

numerous attacks and therefore invested “significant resources” into protecting its assets,

including “large security forces and CSR efforts.”

868. In addition, Respondent refers to Mr. Davies’ testimony that any insurance coverage that
Claimant would likely have obtained would not have extended to business interruption
and be limited to physical damage and repair. Respondent considers the results of Mr.
Davies’ inquiry confirmed by the statement in the Feasibility Study that insurance would

be unavailable or too expensive. !°*°

869. In response to Claimant’s reference to the adjustments made by Prof. Davis to account
for residual risks, in particular the 0.5% annual probability of a permanent shutdown,
Respondent considers that none of the projects he referred to are located in a comparable
environment in terms of security risks and the proposed pipeline route. Respondent
further notes that OPIC insurance on which Prof. Davis based his estimate would not have
been available to Claimant and considers it likely that no private insurance options or
rates would have been available. As for the insurance premiums referred to by Claimant
in the Feasibility Study, Respondent maintains that these do not take into account political
risk but exclude “terrorism” as well as “war and civil war.” Finally, Respondent claims
that the adjustments made by Prof. Davis to cost and production quantities fail to account

for the risks of sabotage and direct attacks. !°°°

870. Respondent concludes that any third-party buyer would have had access to the same
information that Pakistan presented in this arbitration and “would likely have refrained
from going forward’; however, if it had decided to proceed, it could not have relied on
Prof. Davis’ valuation model which, according to Respondent, “does not account for the
cumulative effect of attacks, the impact of security

 

sts on the financials of the project

as management saw it in 2010-2011, and a realistic view of the insurance market.”!!

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

871.

At the outset of its analysis of the issues regarding Claimant’s security plan for the Reko
Dig project and, in particular, for the slurry pipeline, the Tribunal recalls that Respondent
also raised the argument that TCCP failed to adequately address the security risks of the
pipeline already in the liability phase of this proceeding. The Tribunal discussed this
argument, together with the argument that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source
of the project, in the context of its analysis of whether any of the grounds invoked by the
Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject the Mining Lease Application and/or
by Respondent in the arbitration justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application in
November 2011. Similarly to the alleged failure to fully assess the water source, the

873.

alleged failure to adequately address the security risks of the pipeline was one of the
reasons that Respondent raised for the first time in this arbitration. While finding that
Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the
Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal in any event found that none of these additional
reasons, including the reason invoked with regard to the security of the pipeline, would

justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application.!°

At liability stage, Respondent already invoked the statement made in the Bankable
Feasibility Report on the pipeline prepared by the pipeline construction company PSI:

“The safety and security only includes minor support for the offices. No safety

and security has been included in the estimate due to the unknown issues

related to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood to provide a better

cost estimate for this important task.”!°
In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal noted that the security risks had
been subject to an extensive discussion with Mr. Livesey, who explained during the
Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability that PSI is “not a security company so the security
risk issues are transferred across to security which, primarily for this project was handled
by Barrick’'s global security VP and his team in Toronto. And it was input from them that
added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the Feasibility Study under G&A.”'* The
Tribunal further took note of Mr. Livesey’s reference to the chapter on security in the
Feasibility Study, including a paragraph describing security measures for the pipeline,
and his explanation regarding Claimant’s strategy of developing three levels of strategic
partnership, which was reflected in the “Business Strategy” of the Feasibility Study.!°°
In addition, Mr. Livesey provided explanations as to why they “felt [that their] level of
risk was much lower than in the gas pipelines” such as the Sui gas pipeline. In particular,
Mr. Livesey emphasized that, by contrast to the Sui gas pipeline, Claimant would have
been paying royalty to Balochistan, sought to have the GOB as an equity stakeholder and
planned to engage with local communities to provide ongoing support for the project. Mr.
Livesey also explained the basis on which Claimant had concluded that the pipeline was
a cheaper and safer option than using trucks or railway for transportation of the
concentrate, which included the consideration that pipeline patrols could be sourced from

Balochistan. !°°

874. The Tribunal noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that there were some
“residual risks,” including security risks, which were identified in the chapter on asset
valuation but for which no value was included in the economic valuation of the project.!°°7
Referring to the scope of its analysis at liability stage, the Tribunal did not agree with
Respondent that TCCP therefore failed to adequately address the security risks but
considered it plausible that not all risks could be fully assessed or quantified at such an
early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy would evolve over time and
the further development of the project.'°°* Also noting that the GOB had never raised any
concerns regarding the security of the pipeline, even though it had been aware of this
option since December 2007, and that security risks were not mentioned in the Notice of
Intent to Reject, the Tribunal was not convinced that this additional reason invoked by
Respondent in the arbitration played any role in the decision-making process of the
Licnesing Authority in November 2011.!°°

875. By contrast to the allegation that TCCP failed to fully assess the water source for the
project, the allegation that it failed adequately to assess the security risks for the pipeline
did not form part of Respondent’s Reconsideration Request which it filed shortly after
submission of its Counter-Memorial on Quantum. However, the Tribunal agrees with
Respondent to the extent that its more general note regarding the scope of its findings in
the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is worth recalling in the present context as well.
Specifically, the Tribunal noted that it “did not make a finding in the liability phase that
the Feasibility Study fully reflected the true value of the project at the time. It only
assessed the arguments presented by Respondent at the time in support of its position that
denial of the Mining Lease Application was based on justifiable reasons.”"'® Similarly
to the issues regarding water and metallurgy, which were explicitly discussed in the
Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request, neither of the Parties presented any
opinions from independent experts on the security plan for the pipeline or the project in
general in the liability phase as they have now done in the quantum phase. Consequently,
the Tribunal will also make its findings on security based on the Parties’ completed
written submissions and the hearing of the fact and expert witnesses during the Hearing
on Quantum.

876. The Tribunal notes that while the allegation in the liability phase was limited to the

87

x

security risks regarding the slurry concentrate pipeline which was supposed to transport
the concentrate from Reko Diq to Port Gwadar, Respondent’s argument in the present
phase is broader in that it alleges that Claimant generally failed to address the security
risks that the Reko Dig project faced. However, the debate between the Parties and their
experts again focused on the slurry pipeline. Two further aspects were, rather briefly,
mentioned, i.e., the central facilities at Reko Diq and the water supply pipeline from the
Fan Sediments to Reko Diq. The Tribunal will therefore first address Claimant’s security
plan for the project’s central facilities and then turn to the security plan for the off-site
facilities and, in particular, the slurry concentrate pipeline.

i. Whether Claimant Adequately Accounted for the Security of the
Project’s Central Facilities at Reko Diq

As for the central facilities, Respondent contends that Claimant “only planned to secure
the central mining site to a minimum adequate level, avoiding best practices” and
considers the security plan for the central facilities of “low average standard.”!!°!
Respondent’s expert Mr. Davies stated in his first report:

“Chagai district, in which Reko Dig is situated, experiences a low frequency
of serious security incidents compared to many other districts in Balochistan.
The apparent reasons for this are subtle and are explained in Section Two of
our report. In theory, this isolates Reko Dig from the worst effects of the
Baloch separatist insurgency and, as a result, mining operations at Reko Diq
itself could probably have proceeded with a significant but tolerable level of
risk after mitigation had been implemented.”!!°

878. Mr. Davies further considered that there were “some positive elements in TCC’s approach

Ho1
1102

1103

to security planning,” which included that “[t]he strategy for protecting the central
facilities at Reko Dig met what we would consider to be an acceptable standard.” Mr.
Davies also referred to Claimant’s “sensible measure” to fly in non-local workers into
Reko Digq, the issuance of weekly and monthly security reports which he considered to
be “of an average standard compared across the security management industry,” the
commissioning of a Security Risk Assessment by SOS International and the conducting
of risk workshops, which included a focus on security risks. Mr. Davies concluded that
“[mlany of these measures are in-line with what would be expected of an operating
company at this stage of the project cycle. However, in overview we would characterise
the security content of TCC’s Feasibility Study as achieving a low-average standard
compared to industry peers.”''? While noting that Claimant’s security plans were

generally “of an acceptable standard,” Mr. Davies criticized an absence of any plans for
the security of the export pipeline. Similarly, while Mr. Davies further considered that
“Tt]he security budget for the central facilities appears to be appropriate, although we
interpret the standards for fencing to be below what is normally implemented for critical
national infrastructure facilities,” he then criticized the budget for protecting the export

pipeline as “grossly inadequate.”!!°*

879. Based on case studies set out in detail in his report, Mr. Davies provided a summary of
his “cost estimates for security in this type of high threat environment,” which included
an item “Security hardware to protect central production facilities” with an CAPEX
estimate of USD 20-25 million, noting that “[t]his is based on a higher standard of
protection than that described in TCC’s FS and it aligns with other benchmarked projects

 

in comy ble threat envi that have impl. 1 a CNI approach to security

risk mitigation.”!!

880. Mr. Davies derived this estimate from a case study of oil producing field in Oman.
Following an outline of the “key line components of the mitigation strategy,” Mr. Davies
stated that “[t]he specifications are broadly aligned with those described in TCC’s FS,
although they are more clearly defined because they reference internationally recognised
standards.” He noted that “[t]he main difference is the standard of perimeter fencing.”
Mr. Davies stated that the overall cost for these components slightly exceeded USD 50
million, which he considered to be “‘at the high end of the range” due to the standards
imposed by the Government of Oman and therefore concluded that “a CAPEX in the
region of US$ 20 — 25 million would be reasonable balanced against the realistic level
of threat. This is therefore the figure we suggest as a benchmark for the Reko Dig
project,” i.e., the “likely costs of the security hardware to protect the central
facilities.”''°

881.

Claimant’s expert Mr. Ridley agreed with Mr. Davies’ conclusions that Claimant’s
“strategy for protecting the central facilities at Reko Dig met ... an acceptable standard”
and that “mining operations at Reko Dig itself could probably have proceeded with a
significant but tolerable level of risk after mitigation had been implemented.” He
noted that this was in line with the determination in SOS International’s Security Risk
Assessment in 2006 that “[d]espite the fact that Pakistan represents a significant risk to
specific assets and business operations, strategic planning and supported procedures will
ensure a permissible operations environment for businesses.”''°’ Mr. Ridley further

agreed with Mr. Davies’ conclusion that “[t]he security budget for the central facilities
appears to be appropriate.”

As for Mr. Davies’ estimate of additional CAPEX costs for security hardware to protect
the central production facilities, Mr. Ridley explained why, in his opinion, the higher
costs were unnecessary and even counterproductive:

“A higher standard of perimeter fence would have been unnecessary under
the circumstances. In the IMD Feasibility Study, TCC provided for a2 m high
chain link perimeter fence ‘with the capability of being upgraded to a medium
security fence that would include razor wire coils on top and bottom, if
deemed necessary.’ TCC intended the perimeter fence to serve as ‘a site
demarcation boundary to prevent unintentional intrusion, and will serve as a
deterrent for intentional pedestrian or vehicle intrusion.’ Any sensitive areas
received higher protection, including high security areas surrounded by ‘two
parallel 3 m high chain link fences with a 10° angled fence facing outwards
and a 5 m wide patrol road in between’ with ‘a 0.75 m barbed tape coil on top
and two 0.90 m coil of flat wrap barbed tape on the bottom.’ Applying S-RM’s
proposed level of security to the entire perimeter added little value, while also
harming community relations and caused human rights issues by restricting
access for local Bedouins and migrant travellers passing through the

areas.''

Mr. Ridley further considered that Mr. Davies did not provide sufficient information for
his conclusion that a figure of USD 20-25 million would have been appropriate or what
costs this figure would include.!!!°

At the outset of his second report, Mr. Davies noted that he had provided “an objective
and balanced commentary on TCC’s approach to security risk assessment and mitigation.
Where the facts and methodology are appropriate, I have chosen not to question TCC’s
work. For example, I am content to leave undisturbed TCC’s overall security plan at the
mine’s central facilities and the general approach used in the ESIA.”''"' Specifically with
regard to the protection of Reko Diq’s central facilities, he clarified the following:

“IT regard TCC’s security plans for the central facilities as reaching a
minimum acceptable standard, as measured against industry peers. TCC’s
approach to security planning is not revolutionary, but merely adheres to
common practices (and not necessarily ‘best’ practices) in the extractive
industries. For example, my explanation of perimeter protection standards at
paragraph 3.3.2 below, makes it clear that TCC, advised by International
SOS, intended to implement a level of protection below accepted UK and EU
norms. I accept that this does not necessarily imply a ‘kill point’ for the
project, for reasons I have explained in my First Expert Report. However, it

does lead me to question whether TCC understood fundamental principles in

aligning mitigation with threat.”"'"
Mr. Davies restated his critique regarding a “/ow standard of perimeter protection” below
“the currently established benchmark in the UK and the European Union” and maintained
his cocnclusion that “TCC’s plans for the central facilities were ‘a low-average standard
compared to industry peers’. TCC was accepting common practice, not pursuing best
practice.”'''3 Mr. Davis further stated that “[i]n the case of the central facilities, because
protecting a Static site is a straightforward security management task, I accept that the
plan would most likely have developed. Over time, TCC may have achieved a tolerable
balance of risk versus mitigation. It can also reasonably be argued, that companies can
absorb high consequences, resulting from attacks on central facilities, if their risk

tolerance is high enough.”''"4

Based on the opinions offered by the Parties’ experts, the Tribunal considers it common
ground that Claimant’s security plans for protecting the project’s central facilities at Reko
Diq met an acceptable standard. While Mr. Davies clarified in his second report that he
considered specifically the plans for the central facilities to be of “low-average standard”
(in his first report, Mr. Davies had use this term to describe the security content of the
Feasibility Study as a whole, i.e., including the plans for the pipeline), he also stated that
he was “content to leave undisturbed TCC’s overall security plan at the mine’s central
facilities” and identified only one specific criticism regarding the standard of the
perimeter fence. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Davies did not engage in his
second report with the arguments raised by Mr. Ridley that the Feasibility Study also
included higher protection for sensitive areas and that a higher perimeter would have
added little value and even harmed community relations. Mr. Davies also did not provide
any additional information as to how he had arrived at his estimate of additional CAPEX
required to implement the higher security standard he considered appropriate. In the
absence of any further substantiation, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would
have included the additional CAPEX estimate of USD 20-25 million in its valuation of
the Reko Digq project.

The Tribunal has no reason to believe that a buyer in November 2011 would have
considered Claimant’s security plans for protecting the central production facilities at
Reko Dig, including the cost estimates, insufficient. In addition, the Tribunal notes that
Mr. Davies explicitly accepted in his second report that the security plan for the central
facilities “would most likely have developed” and that “[o]ver time, TCC may have
achieved a tolerable balance of risk versus mitigation.” In the Tribunal’s view, it is

plausible and confirmed by the record that Claimant would have continued to develop its
security plans and risk mitigation strategies and that it would also have been able to react
to a potential change in the assessment of certain risks. Conseqently and given the absence
of a substantiated challenge regarding the cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study
for the central facilities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant’s security plans for the
project’s central facilities would have been considered adequate for a project at the
development stage of Reko Diq.

ii. Whether Claimant Adequately Accounted for the Security of the
Project’s Off-Site Facilities, in Particular the Pipeline to Port Gwadar

With regard to the security of the off-site facilities, the criticisms raised by Respondent
and its expert concerned primarily the slurry concentrate pipeline from Reko Dig to Port
Gwadar. However, the Tribunal notes that Respondent also referred to the water supply
pipeline from the Fan Sediments to Reko Diq and considered that “[b]oth of these
pipelines would have been vulnerable to even rudimentary attacks using rockets,
grenades, or improvised explosive devices (IEDs), all of which are common weapons in

Balochistan.”"!!

Mr. Davies noted in the context of a summary he provided on opinions expressed by
“experienced and non-aligned mining investors and senior executives” on the insurability
of the Reko Diq project that these individuals considered “[m]ost aspects of the project
would have been insurable, but WTPV risks looked very negative with respect to the
export pipeline, and to a more or less equal extent the water supply pipeline.”""'® Mr.
Davies did not provide any further assessment or opinion on the costs estimated by
Claimant for protecting the water supply pipeline. In his second report, Mr. Davies
restated his concerns regarding the vulnerability of the slurry pipeline and noted that “the
known threats in the operating area ... apply to other commercial operations outside the
perimeters of the central facilities, not just the slurry pipeline.”''"’ He did not provide
any further assessment regarding the security risks affecting other commercial operations
such as the water supply pipeline.

On that basis, the Tribunal considers that while it has no basis for calling into question
specific cost estimates with regard to the water supply pipeline, it will bear the argument
in mind that certain risks affecting the slurry pipeline could likewise have affected the
water supply pipeline (or other commercial operations outside Reko Diq) and that such
risks should therefore be addressed with regard to both pipelines in a valuation of the
Reko Dig project.

891. Consequently, the Tribunal will now turn to the dispute between the Parties as to whether
Claimant had a feasible plan to address the security risks affecting the slurry pipeline
from Reko Dig to Port Gwadar and whether the Feasibility Study and/or Prof. Davis
adequately accounted for these risks in their estimate of the associated cost impact.

892. In October 2009, the company Pipeline Systems Incorporated (PSI) completed a Reko
Diq Concentrate Pipeline Bankable Feasibility Study, which was appended to the
Feasibility Study. In this report, PSI provided an estimate of the total capital costs “for
the Reko Dig Copper concentrate pipeline and associated facilities in PSI’s scope,”
which amounted to USD 318.6 million for the route to Port Gwadar. PSI expressly noted
that “[i]tems that are not included in the capital cost estimates” were, inter alia,
“Extraordinary security for Stations or Pipeline and associated facilities.”'"'* In Chapter
16 on Pipeline CAPEX and OPEX, PSI clarified that “[t]his capital cost estimate does
not include any extraordinary provisions for security

 

either during construction of the
facilities described here in or for the completed facilities after construction or for day to
day operations.”''!? Specifically with regard to the four pump stations along the pipeline
route, PSI noted that its estimate “includes a minimum security provision, which could be
considered normal for most remote locations. We believe that this level of security for
this project may be inadequate considering the local political environment; the owner
may decide to take extraordinary precautions to protect these facilities.”!'”° In addition,
PSI made the statement on which Respondent had also relied in the liability phase of the
arbitration:

“Safety and Security - The safety and security only includes minor support for

the offices. No safety and security has been included in the estimate due to

the unknown issues related to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood

to provide a better cost estimate for this important task.”!'?!

89.

»

Based on these express statements, it can be considered common ground that the capital
cost estimate provided by PSI did not include costs for “extraordinary security” and that,
as indicated by PST itself, it was therefore appropriate to include additional security costs
accounting for “the local political environment” and “the unknown issues related to
Pakistan” in the estimate for capital and operating expenses in the Feasibility Study. In
this regard, Claimant again referred to Mr. Livesey’s testimony at the Hearing on
Jurisdiction and Liability that security risk issues were not within the expertise of PSI and
were therefore “transferred across to security which, primarily for this project was
handled by Barrick's global security VP and his team in Toronto. And it was input from

them that added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the Feasibility Study under
G&Arl2

894. As pointed out by Claimant, the Copper Transportation Trade-off Study, which was also
appended to the Feasibility Study as Appendix 30.02, noted in the chapter on the slurry
concentrate pipeline that the capital and operating costs for the concentrate pipeline and
associated facilities prepared by PSI excluded certain items such as “Extraordinary
security for Stations or Pipeline and associated facilities” and stated that “SLI has

prepared and included the costs for the excluded items.”'!?3

895. This separation of tasks is confirmed in the Feasibility Study’s chapter on capital costs:

“The capital cost estimates of the pipeline have been based on the pipeline

route alignment developed using Google Earth and verified during the field

trip as much as possible and the pipeline design developed by PSI during a

feasibility study that is detailed in this report.

Provisions for security during construction of the facilities and for the

completed facilities after construction of for day to day operations have been

included by SLI"'!?4

896. Specifically with regard to security for the pumping stations which PSI had considered

potentially inadequate, it is noted that “[a]dditional fencing has been added by SLI for
security purposes.”''?> As pointed out by Respondent, the Feasibility Study further
incorporated — without any changes — the statement made by PSI on “Safety and Security”
which is quoted in paragraph 892 above. However, given that a whole section of PSI’s
report was incorporated into this particular section of the Feasibility Study and taking into
account the other references that SLI in fact did include additional security provisions for
the slurry pipeline, the Tribunal considers it plausible that the PSI statement was only a
remnant that Claimant omitted to amend.

897. Based on a comparison of the capital cost estimate prepared by PSI and the capital cost
estimate included in the chapter on capital costs in the Feasibility Study, it is apparent
that the costs for the security provisions included by SLI were not directly added to the
capital cost estimate for the pipeline. Specifically, PSI concluded that the sub-total capital
cost (before EPCM and contingency) were USD 232.2 million plus 3.8 million for spares
and commissioning, i.e., approximately USD 236 million. PSI also recommended a
contingency of USD 47.2 million.''?° As per the Contingency Summary contained in the
chapter on capital costs in the Feasibility Study, Claimant included a capital cost estimate

However, it is stated in the Feasibility Study that the owner’s cost estimate includes, inter
alia, the following information and project data: “security costs estimate: manpower
readiness (December 2009) by TCC.”''?8 While the owner’s cost does not include a
specific line item for security, it is explained that the line item “field general expenses”
representing 36% of the owner’s cost includes an estimate of USD 2.06 million for
security contractors, which is based on information provided by TCC’s security team, and

also provides a breakdown of this estimate.!!??

Claimant further pointed to the chapter on security in which it is stated that “[t]he off-site
facilities security system will encompass the following: three slurry pipeline pump
stations; and raw water pump station plus booster pump station.” It is further stated that
“Tt]he defined security system equipment and materials are included in the cost estimates
for this FS. The security system is to ensure security access and control and the CCTV
system design to ensure the integrity of the mine and off site facilities.” The chapter then
provides a detailed description of the integrated CCTV (closed circuit television) and
access control system, access cards and detection system.''*? As part of the chapter on
Security Action Management Plans, reference is made to a Product Transportation Plan
including the following measures:

“Product will be sent via concentrate pipeline direct to Port Gwadar via four

pump Stations, one on site and three pump stations on the pipeline.

These pump stations will be secured by a high security fence and manned by

a team led by a TCC security officer and three supervisors working 24 h/d, 7

Chokidars/watchmen.

The access road will be patrolled by a security officer and levies in a vehicle

security measures described in the chapter on security were not included in the capital

“Tt is envisaged that the security forces required during operations phase will

be a combination of TCC personnel supervising a security contractor, plus

Frontier Corps (FC) personnel and police support (Levies).

For the purposes of the OPEX estimate, the security staff was estimated to be

comprised of:

* TCC personnel: a_ security country manager, site managers,
superintendent, senior security officers, senior supervisors, supervisors,
control room operators, security drivers and guards. A total payroll of
115 people;

¢ — Security contractor: a third party service administered by TCC personnel
and composed mainly of supervisors and guards. A total of 67 people
with a cost of $3 750/person/a;

¢ Frontier Corps (FC): a Federal military force with personnel recruited
mostly from the tribal areas and with officers from the Pakistani Army.
A force of 200 persons was included in the estimate. A total of $96 600/a
was allocated to supporting the government personnel (it is assumed that
sporadic lodging and catering is included in this cost);

¢ — Police Corps: all operational activities of the Balochistan police force
are being supervised and monitored from the central police office in
Quetta. A total of $91 500/a was allocated for supporting the government
personnel (this includes sporadic lodging and catering); and Chokidars
/ Watchmen: composed of patrol and guard personnel. A total force of
44 persons at a total annual cost of $75 900/a was allocated for this item.

An allowance was made to include security audits performed by a national

contractor.”!16

904. Against this background, the Tribunal cannot follow the argument that the capital and

905.

906.

operating cost estimates in the Feasibility Study did not include any security costs for the
pipeline. To the contrary, the chapter on security set out the security measures that
Claimant was planning to implement for the slurry pipeline (as well as for the water
supply pipeline) and the chapters on capital and operating costs included corresponding
estimates for the costs associated with implementing these measures.

The question that remains to be answered is whether these estimates and the underlying
security measures that Claimant was planning to implement would have been considered
adequate and sufficient by a buyer in November 2011.

Mr. Davies stated in his first report that in his opinion, Claimant included “wholly
inappropriate and impractical planning and budgetary assumptions for pipeline security
in the Feasibility Study.” He noted that “[p]ipeline security is not explicitly mentioned in
the applicable line items of TCC’s Risk Register (i.e. SEC 03 & SEC 10), and we therefore
assume that TCC did not formally assess the security risks to the export pipeline.” Based

on the case studies presented in his report, Mr. Davies considered it mistaken to assume
that buried pipelines would be less vulnerable to sabotage and that natural gas pipelines
would be more “politically charged” than other types of pipelines. In his opinion, “TCC’s
apparent failure to appreciate the threats to the export pipeline and the aggregated
consequences of sabotage would have introduced a very significant probability of project

failure"37

907. Mr. Davies raised concerns with regard to what he considered to be an “absence of any
plans dealing with the security of the export pipeline. We accept that construction and
operation of the pipeline would happen later in the project, but we would expect at least
some meaningful planning estimate to have been conducted, in order to support
considerations about the feasibility of perhaps the most important part of the project
plan.” Specifically, Mr. Davies considered that the “Security Execution Plan for
Transportation Rout [sic] Survey” was no more than a survey of the pipeline route in
October 2008 and labelled the quality of the document “concerning.” Mr. Davies also
expressed the opinion that “[t]he budget for protecting the export pipeline is grossly
inadequate. We assert that this is because TCC’s security department seriously
misunderstood the inherent vulnerabilities of pipelines in high threat environments and

thus could not provide a sensible cost estimate for protecting the pipeline.”!'*

908. Based on a case study of an oil export pipeline in the Kurdish region of Iraq, Mr. Davies
provided an estimate of what he considered necessary to protect the slurry pipeline from
Reko Diq to Port Gwadar. He stated that the “key line components of the pipeline
protection strategy” for the Iraq oil pipeline included “[o]ne permanent guard post every
2km,” with “[elach guard post [being] manned by 20 soldiers,’ resulting in
“approximately 450 soldiers for the pipeline’s 45km length” and an approximate cost of
USD 8.2 million per year. According to Mr. Davies, such cost is “in line with
expectations, based on similar projects in moderate to high threat environments” and
referred to another case study he had presented on a zinc mining project in Yemen which
included a 4km water pipeline guarded by 60-75 soldiers at a time. He considered the
total manpower requirement “realistic in the absence of an automated alarm triggering

system.”!!39

909. On the assumption that there is a linear relationship between troop levels and length of
the pipeline, Mr. Davies scaled up the troop levels deployed in Iraq to the length of the
Reko Dig pipeline and concluded on “6,820 personnel to secure the entire pipeline.” Mr.
Davies himself noted that “[a]t first glance this might appear to be a grossly inflated
figure” but considered it supported by the “9,000” personnel deployed to protect the Sui

gas pipeline. Mr. Davies further noted that two Pakistani army officers serving with the
Frontier Corps provided the same estimate for dealing with this task but that they had also
“considered the task to be ‘impossible’ in practice, owing to their own experiences of
Baloch insurgents. Apart from the impractical scope of the defensive task, the officers’
main objection was the threat to patrols and resupply movements off-road in the vicinity
of the pipeline.” Mr. Davies also noted that “[i]n the absence of effective technology such
as surveillance UAVs (drones) and Distributed Sensing, the manpower required to ensure
adequate levels of protection will grossly breach the reasonable component of the ALARP

principle.”!'*°

910. Mr. Davies himself considered that the cost resulting from his estimate of required
manpower was “of course unrealistic” and therefore considered that Claimant “should
have considered options that combined detection and alerting technology with a more
flexible armed response based on more intelligent deployment of personnel.” He
nevertheless provided a calculation of the “costs of relying on manpower alone to provide
adequate protection to the export pipeline” based on pay scales advised by a serving
officer and estimated that costs for soldiers, weapons and vehicles would together require
an additional CAPEX of USD 13.68 million and an additional OPEX of USD 20.52
million per year.''4!

911.

Mr. Davies then considered alternative options for protecting the pipeline “without
reducing mitigation below a tolerable level” but considered that: (i) “reducing troop
deployment numbers to save costs would clearly not be justifiable”; (ii) employing drone
technology would have been “unlikely ... to offer significant cost reductions” given the
constraints against this technology and the unavailability of commercial drone technology
in November 2011; and (iii) “transferring the risk to insurance is unrealistic based on
TCC’s own admission.” Mr. Davies therefore concluded that “given such an unfavourable
balance between risk and cost of mitigation, terminating the activity appears to be the
most viable course of action” and “other means of exporting product should be
considered potentially more viable than the pipeline.” Noting that “rail transport is too
inherently vulnerable to sabotage to be seriously considered as a viable option, and in
this respect rail compares closely to pipelines,” Mr. Davies concluded that “[b]ased on
our own experience, we consider than large and less frequent convoys, packaged with

robust defensive armed escorts, offer the optimum cost versus mitigation balance.”!'*

912. In his summary of costs, Mr. Davies included the CAPEX and OPEX estimates for a
6,820 men force but noted that “[t]his level of cost may well be considered unrealistic. If

so, then S-RM contends that the export pipeline option is potentially unviable.” Mtr.
Davies also provided a CAPEX estimate of “< /.0M” for the use of a distribution sensing
system and of “0.5 — 1M” for surveillance UAVs.!'43

Mr. Ridley raised several criticisms with regard to Mr. Davies’ assessment, in particular
that Mr. Davies failed to analyze the available documentation of Claimant’s risk security
assessment but instead relied on unrelated and often unidentified sources as well as
“irrelevant case studies” all of which concerned oil and gas pipelines.'! In his opinion,
“TCC adequately considered and addressed the existing, relevant and foreseeable
security threats specific to the contemplated slurry concentrate pipeline.” Mr. Ridley
further considered that Claimant’s evaluation of residual risk was in line with
international standards and “contributed to the security risks being minimised as far as
reasonably practible.”!'4> Mr. Ridley further considered that “while TCC’s security
planning frames the threat perception in terms of the foreseeable future, TCC also
provided for a progressive roll out and scale of implementation that would correspond
with the evolution and development of the project. This level of flexibility would have
allowed TCC to adjust its approach to meet changing levels and types of security risks
throughout the life of the project.” Mr. Ridley stated that Claimant’s security cost
estimates were based on “careful consideration of the security threats and an evolving
strategy to meet them’ for which he considered there to be “ample proof.” He added that
his “advice in November 2011 would have been that the project could proceed from a

security perspective.” 4°

With regard to Mr. Davies’ cost estimates, Mr. Ridley reiterated that Mr. Davies’ case
studies did not include any example from the mining sector, noting Mr. Davies’ statement
that S-RM did not have experience with mining projects of this scale. In his opinion,
“guard posts would not need to be any closer than an average of 100 kilometers apart”
and “[o]ut of an abundance of caution, [Mr. Ridley] would have recommended at least
five mutually supporting security posts along the entire length of the proposed pipeline.”
Describing further precautions he would have recommended but also considered
sufficient, Mr. Ridley stated that these “could be implemented at a fraction of the cost
that S-RM proposes, remaining well within TCC’s budget.”!'*" By contrast, Mr. Ridley
considered that Mr. Davies’ estimate of required manpower was “more reminiscent of the
days of the Berlin wall than of any modern security approach in order to protect a buried
slurry concentrate pipeline” and noted that Mr. Davies himself admitted the possibility
of using surveillance techonolgy such as a detection and alerting system to trigger an

armed response before a breach occurs and estimated a cost of USD 1.5-2 million. Mr.
Ridley further stated that Mr. Davies’ approach “contravened specific consideration and
prevention strategy noted in numerous community relations assessments not to use armed
military personnel as a substitute for civilian security personnel due to potential human
rights violations—thereby opening the project up to further risks, rather than reducing
them.” In his opinion, the estimate was also superficial as it ignored the four different
types of terrain and visibility calling for a different range within which outposts should

be placed and failed to take into account relevant cost savings.!!48

Mr. Ridley concluded:

“Thus, in my professional opinion, S-RM’s cost estimates are not credible. As

a security professional, I would never advise or employ S-RM’s proposed

strategy, and would never suggest establishment of so many fixed locations

and the expenditure of such high levels of capital. Better, more cost efficient

options would entail mobile assets, frequent patrolling, leveraged

technologies, more competent personnel and active, experienced oversight—

all of which are more in line with TCC’s proposal than with SRM’s inflated

estimates.”'!4°
In his second report, Mr. Davies maintained his concerns regarding the protection
measures contemplated by Claimant for the slurry pipeline which, in his opinion, “were
intended to mitigate theft and casual interference, not sabotage by skilled insurgents
using explosives.”''*° He further continued to “attach little value to TCC’s protection
plan’ for the pipeline based on the “basic observations’ that: (i) Claimant “did not draw
the right lessons from the insurgency in Balochistan and from other examples of pipeline
sabotage,” expressly referring to the attack on the slurry pipeline of the Freeport Grasberg
Mine in Indonesia referenced in PSI’s draft report; and (ii) Claimant continued to rely on
the “inappropriate” plan to bury the pipeline to make it resilient against sabotage. Mr.
Davies further emphasized that the “leveraged technologies” offered by Mr. Ridley were
not included in Claimant’s “extraordinary” security costs referred to by Claimant and
there was no evidence that such mitigation measures were considered by Claimant at the
time.!'5! As a second observation, Mr. Davies pointed out that the decision to construct
the pipeline was taken only after the Security Risk Assessment had been carried out by
International SOS and that he would have expected “to see an equally detailed
supplementary security risk assessment for the pipeline’s proposed route(s).” In the
absence of evidence that there was “an adequate level of scrutiny” and based on his
review of the proposed mitigation measures, Mr. Davies maintained the opinion that

“TCC’s proposed mitigation plan for the pipeline is well below what I would consider

reasonable, when measured against the potential threats.”'!>

In the Tribunal’s view, Mr. Davies’ statements in his second report confirm that the main
issue in dispute between the Parties is whether Claimant sufficiently accounted for the
risk of sabotage and/or attacks on the pipelines by insurgent groups in Balochistan. While
there is common ground regarding the presence of insurgent groups in Balochistan and
the existence of a risk that critical infrastructure of the project might be subject to an
attack, the Parties and their experts have fundamentally deviating views regarding the
level of risk affecting specifically the slurry pipeline and the security measures that could
or should have been implemented to address this risk.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that while Mr. Davies included in his first report an
estimate of costs required to deploy 6,820 armed guards for protection of the pipeline, he
noted himself that “[t]his level of cost may well be considered unrealistic” and did not
recommend that these measures should be adopted in reality. However, Mr. Davies then
took the opinion that the level of risk could not be mitigated to a tolerable level without
such prohibitive costs and therefore concluded that the pipeline was not a viable option.

The Tribunal is not convinced by this opinion. In particular, Mr. Davies himself presented
as an alternative to such a large number of armed guards the use of surveillance UAVs
and distributed sensing systems and provided an CAPEX estimate of below USD 2
million for both measures. While Mr. Davies emphasized that these measures were not
included in the cost estimates of the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal considers it plausible
that the security plan would have continued to evolve over time and the development of
the project, as Mr. Ridley also expressly confirmed. Mr. Davies pointed out that UAV
surveillance was still evolving in 2011 but this does not mean that a buyer would therefore
have ignored, or would have expected Claimant to ignore, an evolving technology that
would likely become commercially available in the future. Mr. Davies also did not explain
why he did not consider it a viable option to implement a distributed sensing system,
except to reiterate that this system was not included in the Feasibility Study.

The Tribunal also takes note of Mr. Ridley’s opinion that “[o]ut of an abundance of
caution, [he] would have recommended at least five mutually supporting security posts
along the entire length of the proposed pipeline” and his reference to certain additional
options regarding the communication and detection system that Claimant could have
used. In Mr. Ridley’s opinion, these precautions “would have sufficed to protect the
pipeline and could be implemented at a fraction of the cost that S-RM proposes,
remaining well within TCC’s estimated budget.”''>? Mr. Davies has not provided a

deviating estimate for the costs of Mr. Ridley’s proposed security measures but the
Tribunal considers the relatively marginal dimension of additional costs involved
confirmed and in line with Mr. Davies’ estimate for detection and surveillance
technology.

In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced that the level of risk affecting the slurry
pipeline was so high that that it would have rendered the slurry pipeline an unviable option
if the implemented security measures did not serve to fully mitigate the risk of an attack.
The Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has taken Respondent’s submissions as well as
the opinions provided by Prof. Rais and Mr. Davies regarding the security situation in
Balochistan, and specifically the districts through which the pipeline would go, very
seriously. In particular, the Tribunal does not wish to take the complex situation outlined
by Prof. Rais lightly nor does it wish to brush away the concerns that the slurry pipeline
would have been subject to a considerable level of threat from insurgents and possibly
even terrorists. However, the Tribunal also considers it established that the security
situation was assessed and analyzed by Claimant’s security team, supervised by Barrick’s
Global Security Vice President as well as by third-party consultants such as Mr. Ridley,
and that mitigation measures were being developed and corresponding cost estimates
were included in the Feasibility Study.

While Mr. Davies considered it a fundamental mistake to assume that burial of the
pipeline would protect it against attacks, the Tribunal notes that Claimant and Mr. Ridley
referred to various other arguments as to why it was concluded at the time that the slurry
pipeline would be less vulnerable to attacks than oil and gas pipelines, such as the Sui gas
pipeline. In particular, Claimant also pointed to: (i) the design and material of the pipeline
and the relative ease of repairing it; (ii) the absence of flammable and combustible
content; and (iii) the slow flow of the concentrate which could be discontinued and
drained from the pipeline in case of a breach, all of which would reduce the damage
inflicted and thus the incentive to attack in the first place.

In his direct examination at the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Ridley referred to the only
example of an attack on a slurry concentrate pipeline (in Indonesia in 1986) to which Mr.
Davies had pointed in his second report. Mr. Ridley explained that he was personally
involved in investigating the incident and reviewing the damage done to the pipeline at
the Freeport Grasberg Mine. In response to the question what the impact of the incident
involving the pipeline was to the operations of the mine, he testified:

“Negligible. The pipelines are routinely closed or suspended for both

maintenance, repairs. And, in this instance, it was both negligible because
the operations continued in other parts of the production.

The pipeline itself is merely a means of transportation from A to B. And the
primary motivation of those people that were targeting the pipeline itself was

to extract the copper and gold concentrate. And, as a result, it was quickly
responded, repaired to.

Take into consideration that this was an above-ground exposed pipeline, and
even then, the overall disruption was minimal.

Q. When you say ‘minimal,’ what does that mean in terms of downtime?

A. In terms of the directly affected or associated reasons for closure, maybe

a few hours, and it was either simply repaired or operations in pumping

continued, even though it was breached. I used ‘breached’ as an exotic term

for a hole because most of the holes that were put into the pipeline were using

kitchen’ implements: Saws, picks, axe, anything they could get their hands

924. Mr. Ridley further confirmed that the Grasberg Mine has “been running for 50 years. The

pipeline itselfwas installed in the late ‘70s ... and it still remains both active and
profitable today.”'!'>

925. Claimant also pointed to the description of the incident in Indonesia in OPIC
Memorandum of Determinations of 1986 on which Mr. Davies had also relied for
reference to this incident in his second report:

“At approximately 10:00 p.m. February 19 the slurry and fuel pipelines were
severed by hacksaw in several locations resulting in a substantial loss of
slurry, containing copper, silver and gold ores, and diesel fuel. Fires were set
at the breaks along the fuel line. A party of police and security personnel was
fired on while attempting to approach the site of the fuel fires. Shortly
thereafter, the alleged saboteurs fled, the fires were extinguished, and within
a few hours both pipelines had been repaired and returned to full operation.

The [second] strike came the night of April 24. Both the slurry and the diesel
fuel pipelines were again cut, related valves and plumbing were vandalized,
a flush tank was drained, electrical wires were cut, the access road was
blocked by felled trees and boulders and mobile construction equipment tires
were burned. Several segments of the slurry pipeline were carted off. This
time, because company officials responded to the rumors by interrupting the
pumping of slurry, no slurry was lost through that pipeline. However,
substantial diesel fuel was lost and again fires were set along the fuel line.
Again security and repair crews were met with gunfire as they approached
the sites of the damage. Police and GOI military personnel assisted in
securing the area. One alleged saboteur was shot and killed by the security
forces. By 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon of April 25 repairs were completed and
the pumping of slurry was resumed.”''*6

926. With regard to this description, Mr. Davies confirmed during his oral testimony that the
Grasberg slurry pipeline was not buried and that, by contrast to the diesel-fuel running
pipeline running next to it, “a concentrate wouldn’t burn.” In response to the question
whether he would agree that the downtime for damage to a slurry pipeline is not very
long, Mr. Davies testified as follows:

“When repairing a pipeline or any other component, there are two things
which enter into consideration. The first is the technical requirement, that

will take a certain amount of time; and the second is whether the area is
permissive or nonpermissive.

Now, what I also said in my Second Report is that OPM militants—'militants,’
I'm not even sure that's the right word--are at the bottom of the scale of
capability. This I see as a disruptive sabotage-type event by unprofessional,
disorganized, disaggregated threat actors. I would not draw any parallel in
terms of the capability of these threat actors across to highly professional,
highly organized insurgents in Balochistan.

I would characterize Baloch separatist insurgents along with, you know, the
capability that we see, you know, demonstrated by Al-Qaeda in Yemen, Al-
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and other groups which are characterized as
terrorist organizations but which are effectively guerrilla armies, and that's
amatter of labeling, but I'm at pains here to point out that OPM, the saboteurs
in this case, are at the bottom end of the scale in terms of capability; hence,
you know, easy access to an above-service pipeline using hacksaws, lighting
fires, this is--you know, this is really bottom-end stuff””!'>"

927. Mr. Davies confirmed that by contrast to the incident in Indonesia which was caused by
striking workers, the risk in Balochistan being discussed was “the possibility of people
coming along and detonating part of the pipeline out in the country somewhere and then
going away again so that they wouldn't be caught, not actually occupying the line of the
pipe.” Mr. Davies further confirmed that it was about “considering the balance between
what would be the cost of maintaining ... an army of 7,000 people on the line and what
would be the cost of mending it from time to time, something which can really only sort

of be ascertained by experience.” Mr. Davies emphasized that he had not seen in
Claimant’s documentation an assessment of the aggregate loss caused by an attack and
the number of attacks likely to be expected, which would have provided an “order of
magnitude” feel to understand the risk tolerance of the project.'!** Mr. Davies confirmed,
however, that the pipeline could be restored very quickly “[ilf you have access to the

pipeline in a more or less permissive environment, yes.” He also confirmed that Claimant

was planning to use a fibre optic cable that “would shut down the pumps as a reactive

measure” in case the pipeline was breached.'!°

Based on the explanations provided by the Parties’ experts, the Tribunal is not convinced
that an attack of the slurry concentrate pipeline in Balochistan would have caused major
damage and thus would have required or even justified the implementation of security
measures at the cost proposed by Mr. Davies. He expressly confirmed that, if breached,
the pipeline could be mended relatively quickly and there would also be relatively little
loss of slurry given the automatic shutdown of the pumps. Therefore, and while noting
that the additional cost proposed by Mr. Davies would have reduced the value of the
project by USD 400 million according to Prof. Davis’ model,''® and would therefore in
any event not have rendered the project economically unfeasible, the Tribunal is not
convinced that a buyer would have added costs of this magnitude in its valuation of the
project. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that the contingency for the project included
a contingency of 20% for the slurry pipeline, i.e., USD 47.3 million. In the Tribunal’s
view, it is therefore plausible that, as Mr. Ridley has testified, additional security
measures for the pipeline such as the distributed sensing system proposed by Mr. Davies
or the communication and detection system proposed by Mr. Ridley would have remained
within Claimant’s estimated budget.

In addition, the Tribunal considers that if the frequency of attacks and/or the severity of
damage turned out to be higher than anticipated, Claimant would have been able to adapt
its security plan and react to the new level of threat. That Claimant had identified and
assessed the risks in this regard is demonstrated by Claimant’s residual risk register which
included, inter alia, the following risks: (i) “TCC Security staff Implicated in human
rights abuses resulting in reputational damage’, (ii) “Direct violent attack incountry by
any hostile force resulting in injuries, death, business disruption”; (iii) “Criminal
extortion & kidnap caused by criminal groups possibly resulting in personnel harm,
reputational and financial loss”; (iv) “Theft of explosives & blasting accessories - linked
to CPLI13 leading to restrictions on our ability to operate, disruptions and reputational
and financial loss”; (v) “Sabotage of Equipment Structures (IMD) e.g. Interference with
blasts, tailings thickener, etc. resulting in disruptions and financial loss” ; (vi) “Disruption
in supply chain caused by unrest situations resulting in business interruption”; (vii)
“Interruption of goods and concentrate supply chain on roads, rail, ports, sea caused to
any terrorism/civil unrest resulting in disruption and financial loss”; and (viii) “Inability
to secure the supply routes for stores and concentrate for the construction and operations

phase, causes delays and increases costs.” Claimant had further identified risk mitigation

strategies to address these risks and reported on their progress.!'¢!

Respondent pointed out that Claimant did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX impact to a
number of security-related risks, including the risks quoted in items (i) through (iv) above.
As the Tribunal noted already in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal
continues to consider it plausible that not all risks could be fully assessed and quantified
at such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy would evolve
over time and the further development of the project.''®* While the Tribunal was
concerned at the liability stage only with the question whether this amounted to a failure
of TCCP justifying a denial of the Mining Lease Application, the Tribunal now has to
assess whether a buyer of the Reko Dig project in November 2011 would have assigned
a quantifiable impact to these risks and, if so, by how much this would have reduced the
value of the project. In this regard, the Tribunal will review whether Prof. Davis has
adequately quantified the residual security-related risks.

iii Whether Prof. Davis Has Adequately Quantified Residual Security-
Related Risks

As pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Davis reviewed the residual risk register in preparing
his valuation of the project. Prof. Davis explained that for the risks for which Claimant
had estimated a financial impact, he used the impact estimated by Claimant to calculate
the cash flow impact of these risks. As for the risks for which Claimant did not estimate
a financial impact, Prof. Davis class

 

fied them in four categories, i.e., material risks that
could cause: (i) the early termination of the project; (ii) delays in starting project
construction; (iii) temporary interruption of operations. The fourth category included

risks with no material impact.!!©

As for the four security-related risks for which Claimant has not estimated a financial
impact, Prof. Davis classified the three risks regarding human rights abuses, criminal
extortion and kidnap, and theft of explosives and blasting accessories in the third
category, i.e., as material risks that could cause temporary interruption of operations.!!®
In this regard, Prof. Davis noted that Claimant had planned to purchase business
interruption insurance with a coverage of USD 1 billion of lost income which was to
cover a total production interruption for a year and more moderate loss for up to two
years. On that basis, he assumed that the risks classified in that category (to the extent
that no separate cash flow asjustment was made) would be covered by this business

interruption insurance the premium of which was included in the project costs.!!® Prof.
Davis further noted that he had also adjusted production amounts to account for the risk
of business interruptions lasting less than 30 days as these would not be compensated by
insurance and explained how he had arrived at his estimate of the annual financial loss
due to production interruptions.''® This estimate was not challenged by Respondent or
its experts.

Respondent placed particular emphasis on the fact that Claimant had not estimated a
financial impact for the risk of “Direct violent attack incountry by any hostile force
resulting in injuries, death, business disruption.” Prof. Davis classified this risk in the
first category, i.e., as a material risk that could lead to early termination of the project.!!°7
Prof. Davis further explained that he “incorporate[d] the risk of early project termination
in the simulation by assuming that in each year, starting with the first year of
construction, there is 0.5% probability that the project ends prematurely.”''® Tn his first
report, Prof. Davis already confirmed that this risk category “includes events caused by
either extreme political violence or government action” and made explicit reference to
the risk pointed to by Respondent.!!®? He further stated that the magnitude of this risk can
be quantified based on the price of insurance protecting against such events and referred
to “a range of indicative prices for political violence coverage” provided by the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which “includes coverage for losses caused by
declared and undeclared war, hostile actions by national or international forces,
revolution, insurrection, civil strife, terrorism, and sabotage.” Noting that the high end
of this range was USD 0.53 per year for each USD 100 of insured asset value and based
on his “understanding of past experience with large projects,” Prof. Davis decided to “use
a likelihood of permanent premature shut-down at Reko Dig due to such acts of 0.5%

annually.”'"7°

Respondent’s experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells stated in their first report that “[t] he
Y2 percent annual complete stoppage proability hardly covers these eventualities,” i.e
“the very real possibility that production will be interrupted for substantial periods from
time to time, but perhaps permanently, by the armed forces in the region.”!'"! They did
not, however, engage with the considerations underlying Prof. Davis’ assumption nor did
they express an opinion which alternative percentage they would have considered more
appropriate in the circumstances.

935. In response, Prof. Davis placed emphasis on the impact of assuming an annual 0.5%
probability of permanent shut down:

“The annual 0.5% probability of shut down included in my model amounts to
an 18% cumulative probability of shut-down due to political violence over
the course of the 39- year mine life in the expanded case.221 It is even higher,
26%, when the IMD mine life option is selected.222 Even accounting for the
fact that in some simulations the Project would shut down early for other
reasons, resulting in a shorter than planned mine life, 14.6% of the 200,000
simulations result in Project shut down caused by this factor alone. It reduces
the value of the investment by $1.4 billion, or 14% relative to a scenario
where this risk would be absent (the fair market value of TCC’s share would
be $9.9 billion instead of $8.5 billion.)”!'

936. In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells engaged in more detail with Prof.
Davis’ assumption. In their opinion:

“The fact is that for every particular year the average probability is only
0.073%, not 0.5%. This is so because, as Brattle indicates in the quote above,
only 14.6% of the cases are affected by the 0.5% occurrence, but not the
remaining 85.4%, so one has to take the weighted average of 0% and 0.5%.
Note that closures for ‘extreme political violence and government action’ are
restricted so that they can occur only after production starts, considerably
reducing their effect, but there is no reason why such an event cannot occur
even in the first year of development.”'!'

937. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered the relevant question to be: “what is the
expected mean or average life of the project given the Bernoulli distribution proposed by
Brattle with a probability of 0.5%?” and noted that the mean expected life was not much
shorter than the nominal life, “which makes little sense in a project situated in
Balochistan.” In their opinion, “an investor might be satisfied with ... a mean expected
life of about half or less of the nominal life,’ which would imply an annual probability of
between 3.5% (30-year project) and 5% (20-year project).!!4

938. Mr. Brailovksy and Prof. Wells also addressed Prof. Davis’ reliance on the indicative
rates provided by OPIC and pointed to the statements made by OPIC above the indicative

rates:!!7°

Indicative Rates

In certain cases, OPIC Insurance rates may fall outside of the ranges shown in the table below, depending on the
particular risk profile of he project. Itis also possible that the ranges shown also could be adjusted and affect rates for
potential insurance contracts. However, once an insurance contract is executed, the rates in that contract are fixed for
the contract's term.

OPIC insurance contracts generally require that premiums be paid annually in advance.

OPIC insurance may not be available for certain coverages, or there may be limitations for underwri ing or other
reasons. Investors should consult the country list page regarding availability in par icular countries.

 

Coverage Active/Current Standby
Inconvertibility $0.18-$0.42 $0 20
Expropriation $0.28-$0.60 $0 20

Assets $0.21-$0 53 $0 20

 

 

 

* Discounted rates may be available for smalll businesses and/or a combination of coverages.
** Investors should contact OPIC directly for information on pricing for Non-Honoring of a Sovereign Guaranty and Oil
and Gas coverages.

939. They further noted that, as can be seen in the above excerpt, OPIC provides two types of
insurance against political violence, i.e., for business income and assets, with a maximum
rate of USD 0.53 for each of them. In their opinion, the two types of insurance are not
mutually exclusive but “at least partially additive” given that OPIC states in its Handbook
as a footnote to its rates for “Manufacturing Services” that “[d]iscounted rates may be
available for combined business income and assets political violence coverages.”'""° Mr.
Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further considered that Prof. Davis should also have included
the maximum rate for the risk of “Jnconvertibility’ (USD 0.42) and of “Expropriation”
(USD 0.60), which would add up to a total rate of USD 2.08 or, assuming a 10% discount
on the combined political violence insurance, a total rate of USD 1.97 per USD 100 of
insured value.''”’ In addition, they considered that Prof. Davis used the wrong reference
as the OPIC Handbook includes a table specifically for natural resources (except oil and

gas), which provides the following rates:!!78

for US businesses, insures only up to 90% of the investment and with a time limit of 20
years. Considering that “[c]ommercial insurance rates ... would likely be much higher,”
they concluded that “calculations of probabilities of political risk events based on OPIC

rates are simply not relevant.”!!7°

Finally, they relied on an analysis performed by Respondent’s expert Dr. Burrows in his
second report which resulted in an “implied annual probability of loss in Pakistan in
November 2011” between 4.6% and 8.2%. They calculated that when changing only this
assumption in Prof. Davis’ model, this range of probabilities would lead to a value of
between USD 1.539 billion and minus USD 895 million.'!*° They conclude:

“These results are consistent with those of both the SNC-Lavalin study and

the unmodified Brattle Report when appropriate discount rates are applied.

It seems that a fatal flow in the Brattle analysis is the whopping

underestimation of the risk of ‘early termination due to extreme political

violence or government action.’ A proper calculation of the probabilities of

this risk, which is no other than country risk, leads to more sensible results

from the ‘modern’ DCF.”!'*!

Dr. Burrows, who had not expressed an opinion on the 0.5% annual probability in his first
report, stated in his second report that this estimate of “Pakistan country risk” is “absurdly
low and based on a seriously flawed reasing of available data.”!'*? He provided the
following reasons for his opinion: (i) OPIC insurance rates may fall outside the range of
indicative rates and do not reflect the level of private insurance; (ii) OPIC’s political risk
coverage does not reflect all country risk and provides several limitations as a result of
which it does not measure the full extent and range of risk faced by private investors; and
(iii) OPIC states in its financial accounting statements for 2012 that its political risk

944,

insurance premiums are approximately 0.9% of its “current exposure to claim’ and

highlights that projects in, inter alia, Pakistan, “often entail more risk.”''**

Dr. Burrows further refers to a methodology that Prof. Davis used in a different arbitration
proceeding for the calculation of the “probability of closure due to political risk” for Peru.
Noting that he “obtained data on Pakistan from one of the study’s authors (Geert Bekaert)
covering the time period from 2006 to 2011,” Dr. Burrows stated that he followed the
same methodology to calculate the probability for Pakistan, resulting in a range of 4.6%
to 8.2%, which would result in cumulative loss probability over 30 years of 75.8% to
92.3%. '!84 Dr. Burrows added that, in his opinion, the large deviation from the probability
assumed by Prof. Davis could not be due to his exclusion of unlawful actions, considering
it “unlikely that unlawful actions by Respondent would account for much, if any, of the

gap” between their respective estimates.!!*5

The Tribunal notes that the timing of the introduction of Respondent’s experts’ detailed
arguments on the 0.5% annual probability formed the subject of several debates between
the Parties and the Tribunal, including at the Hearing on Quantum. Prof. Davis had
included already in his first report his analysis of the 0.5% annual probability while
Respondent’s experts presented their detailed arguments in opposition only together with
Respondent’s Rejoinder on Quantum. This was the case, in particular, of the analysis
made by Dr. Burrows based on data he stated to have obtained from Dr. Bekaert but did
not fully provide to Claimant or Prof. Davis for analysis. Apart from the question whether
and to which extent Claimant was prejudiced by the introduction of a new analysis in the
Rejoinder, Prof. Davis expressed the opinion at the Hearing on Quantum that the
methodology applied by Bekaert ef al. did not work for Pakistan as it is based on a
country’s sovereign spread which, in Pakistan’s case, is not driven by political risk and
therefore not an indicator that can be used for this purpose. Noting that he had not been
provided with all relevant data underlying Dr. Burrows’ analysis, Prof. Davis testified
that he had tested the data he did receive and considered that “the problem is that the
model just doesn’t work for Pakistan.” Following a detailed explanation as to why he
considered that the model did not adequately predict either Pakistan’s sovereign spread
or the political risk included in that spread, Prof. Davis also illustrated with the following
graph why in his opinion, Pakistan’s sovereign spread “embodies very little information

on political risk in Pakistan”:''*°

945. Prof. Davis provided the following additional explanation as to why he used the Bekaert
methodology in the arbitration Bear Creek v. Peru but not in this case:

“Well, in Bear Creek, we were not instructed to ignore expropriation risk,
and so we needed to adjust the Project cash flows or discount them downward
for that asymmetric risk. There was political turmoil at the time of the
valuation. A new President was coming into office. It was not clear how he
was going treat mining entities, and so we sought to capture as a discount to
my valuation in that approach an index. So, we used Bekaert, his conversion
of sovereign spread to a political risk discount or country-risk discount for
Pert. I think it was 1.4 percent there. And we liked it because Pert was in the
original sample in his paper. Pakistan was outside the original sample, so
they hadn't really proven that the model worked for Pakistan. And the other
reason is, we didn't have any kind of detailed analysis like we had here with
the Risk Register and all the possibility risks and how frequently they could
happen and what the impact would be.

There was no Risk Register for the Perti case. So, we needed to use a blunter
instrument, and we elected to go with the Bekaert adjustment of 1.4 percent
to the cash flows to try to encompass all of these things that were missing,
basically, from the Feasibility Study and were not available to us.”!!87

946. Dr. Burrows rejected Prof. Davis’ opinion that the study “doesn’t work for Pakistan,”
arguing as follows:

“Well, the study, as he knows, was a cross-sectional study. It wasn't a study
of Pakistan. It was a study of political risk--how political risks related to the
Sovereign Bond Yield across the world, as a cross-sectional study.

So, if worked for Pert, it works for Pakistan. You can't make the Statement
that it would work for Peri and not work for Pakistan. It wasn't a study--it
wasn't a longitudinal study of Pakistan. It was a cross-sectional study.”!!88

947. Dr. Burrows further considered that Prof. Davis had misapplied the Bekaert methodology

because he had applied the percentage of the predicted spread accounted for by political
risk to the predicted observed spread of Pakistan instead of the actual observed spread.
In his opinion, a correct analysis would result in the following contribution of political

risk to the sovereign yield spread:!!*°

948. During his cross-examination, Dr. Burrows maintained that the Bekaert et al. study

for results for Pakistan, he updated his model” and confirmed that “to the best of his
recollection,” the data provided was not reflected in the data reported in the Bekaert et al.

yield spread and its political risk rating in the chart presented by Prof. Davis but
maintained his opinion that this was irrelevant because Dr. Bekaert “was doing a cross-
section analysis. He was taking advantage of fluctuations across countries and trying to
use that to explain how sovereign yield spread across countries is affected by political

risk spread. He wasn't doing a longitudinal analysis of any one country.” He also rejected
the argument that, by testing whether the model could predict the sovereign yield spread
itself, Prof. Davis had tested it as to its validity for Pakistan, claiming that this test

“contradicted the test that the authors of the paper said was the way to test the model.”!!!

Based on its review of the opinions offered by the Parties’ experts and the supporting
documentation provided by the Parties, the Tribunal is not convinced that the analysis
brought forward by Dr. Burrows based on data he had received from Dr. Bekaert provides
a reasonable estimate for the annual probability of permanent shut down that Prof. Davis
should have included in his valuation model. Besides taking note of Dr. Burrows’
confirmation that Dr. Bekaert “updated his mode?” with new data for Pakistan which was
not included in his published study and apparently not shared with Claimant or Prof.
Davis, the Tribunal is not convinced that the model would produce valid results for
Pakistan. In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Dr. Burrows’ argument as to why he
considered the differing development of the sovereign yield spread and the political risk
rating irrelevant. Even if the model was based on an analysis across various countries, the
Tribunal does not understand how this would render the relationship between the spread
and the rating in the particular country in question irrelevant. The Tribunal also does not
find it convincing that Dr. Burrows dismisses Prof. Davis’ test of the validity of the model
for Pakistan and simply assumes that the model either works for all countries or for none
of them. In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow Dr. Burrows’ argument that Prof. Davis’
test contradicted the Bekaert ef al. study. While the authors state that the ratio of the
spread accounted for by political risk is to be applied to the “actual observed spread,”!!°*
they do not state that it would be invalid to test whether the model could also predict the
observed spread itself.

As an additional consideration, the Tribunal notes that if the range of political risk
produced by the Bekaert model is applied as the annual probability of permanent
shutdown, this results, according to Dr. Burrows, in a cumulative probability of 75.8% to
92.3% that the project would have to be shut down during the first 30 years of the life of
the mine. In the Tribunal’s view, such an assumption is not warranted or justified by the
circumstances in Balochistan. This would even exceed the assumption made by Mr.
Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that an investor would expect the mean expected life of the
project to be “about half or less” of the nominal life, which the Tribunal also does not
find convincing. They do not provide any authority or other support for their statement

that “an investor might be satisfied’ with this assumption for a project situated in

Balochistan. !!°

The Tribunal also cannot follow the argument raised by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells
that Prof. Davis’ 0.5% annual probability in reality corresponds to only 0.073% because
“only 14.6% of the cases are affected by the 0.5% occurrence, but not the remaining
85.4%, so one has to take the weighted average of 0% and 0.5%.”''** Prof. Davis stated
that “4.6% of the 200,000 simulations result in Project shut down caused by this factor
[i.e., the annual 0.5% probability] alone.”"'> In the Tribunal’s view, this cannot
reasonably be understood to mean that the 0.5% annual probability is applied only to
14.6% of the simulations; it is rather applied to all simulations and results in 14.6% early
terminations.

Given that the Tribunal is not convinced by either of the alternative assumptions made by
Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells or Dr. Burrows, the question that remains to be answered
is whether Prof. Davis’ reliance on the indicative rates provided by OPIC for insurance
against political violence for assets can be considered adequate. While the Tribunal has
taken note of the caveats expressed by OPIC, in particular that actual rates might fall
outside of the range of the presented indicative rates, and of the undisputed fact that OPIC
insurance itself would not have been available to Claimant, the Tribunal considers that
these indicative rates are in any event the best estimate of what the financial impact of
either taking out political violence insurance or otherwise making a corresponding
deduction from the project value by a buyer would have been. In the absence of any more
specific data on rates for Pakistan, the Tribunal also considers it plausible to apply the
maximum rate of the indicative range.

However, as pointed out by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, Prof. Davis decided to apply
only the rate for insurance of asset value and did not consider an additional rate for
insurance of business income. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells also pointed out that OPIC
provides rate specifically for “infrastructure/natural resources (Except Oil and Gas)”
which, inter alia, provides a rate of up to 0.75 for insurance against political violence for
assets.!!°6 By contrast, the Tribunal is not convinced by the argument that Prof. Davis
should also have included the rate for “Jnconvertibility” or “Expropriation” in order to
determine the annual probability of a permanent mine shut down. Prof. Davis explained
that he was instructed not to make adjustments for the risk of illegal government conduct,
such as the risk of uncompensated expropriation.'!®’ As noted in the OPIC Handbook,

currency inconvertibility coverage also insures against government action or inaction

preventing the transfer of investment returns from insured investments. !!°8

The Tribunal has not been provided with any argument as to why the present assessment
of Claimant’s damages, which must eliminate Respondent’s Treaty breaches, should
account for risks caused by the host Government’s unlawful conduct. In this regard, the
Tribunal also notes that specifically for natural resources projects, OPIC “[a]dditionally”
offers insurance against “the unlawful withdrawal or breach by the host government of
mineral exploration and development rights, and other legal rights vital to the success of
a particular project.” In the Tribunal’s view, the availability of such additional insurance
clarifies that the rates for “political violence” insurance do not cover the types of risks or
breaches that the present assessment is intended to eliminate.

On balance, the Tribunal therefore concludes that while it considers the basis for Prof.
Davis’ assumption reasonably reliable as an indicator for the risks he intended to capture,
it is not entirely convinced that the rate he came up with fully captures these risks. The
Tribunal notes that Prof. Davis also drew on his experience with past projects but did not
provide any further detail in this regard, including after Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells
had raised detailed criticisms with regard to the particular indicative rate on which he had
relied. In particular, Prof. Davis did not provide any explanation as to why he based his
estimate only the “assets” rate and did not consider it appropriate to refer to the “business
income” rate even though a permanent shutdown would also, if not primarily, result in a
loss of future cash flows that would otherwise have been generated by the mine. Prof.
Davis also did not provide any indication as to why he did not refer to the range of
insurance rates for “assets” of infrastructure and natural resources projects (except oil and
gas) even though there can be no dispute that Reko Diq would qualify as such a project.

The Tribunal does not wish to go as far as to consider it established that Prof. Davis should
have combined the rates for “assets” and “business income” for the purposes of
determining the annual probability of permanent shutdown. However, the Tribunal recalls
in particular that even on the assumption that it was appropriate for Prof. Davis to rely
(only) on the “assets” rubric of OPIC insurance rates, the maximum indicative rate for
infrastructure and natural resources projects amounts to 0.75. On that basis, the Tribunal
considers it reasonable to conclude that a buyer would have applied a higher annual
probability of permanent shutdown than assumed by Prof. Davis in his valuation model,
more specifically a probability in the range of the maximum rate of 0.75 for infrastructure
and natural resources projects.

The Tribunal has not been provided with a sensitivity analysis by either of the Parties’
experts on the impact of assuming a higher annual probability of annual shutdown based

on indicative OPIC insurance rates other than the rate relied on by Prof. Davis. In the
absence of a sensitivity analysis based on an annual shutdown probability in the range of
0.75%, the Tribunal considers that the most reasonable assumption is to start from Prof.
Davis’ explanation that the 0.5% probability reduced the value of the project by USD
1.423 billion and to increase this amount by 50%, i.e., USD 711.5 million, in order to
reflect the Tribunal’s considerations above. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that an
additional amount of USD 711.5 million has to be deducted from the value of Claimant’s
investment

Whether Claimant Has Established That It Had a Feasible Plan for Compliance
with Environmental Regulations and Obtaining a Social License to Operate

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that its approach to identifying, assessing and managing potential
environmental and social risks of the project was consistent with international best
practices and in line with what lenders and regulators would have expected for the Reko
Dig project at this stage.!!°? Claimant notes that the ESIA process was coordinated by
Mr. Cessford of SRK Consulting UK Ltd who confirms that none of the criticisms raised
by Respondent are material enough to have an effect on the quality of the ESIA.!2
Claimant also refers to the testimony of Mr. Livesey and Ms. Cessford to argue that the
ESIA process reflected a dynamic collaboration between Claimant, its owners and third-
party consultants and that the final ESIA ensured compliance with the most stringent

standards in the industry. !?°!

Claimant contends that the ESIA addressed “the full range of issues that could potentially
be impacted by TCC’s proposed mine” and that the ESIA process was completed over
three years before it was submitted to Balochistan together with TCCP’s Mining Lease
Application. Claimant emphasizes that no concern was raised with regard to any issue
covered in the ESIA before this arbitration, including in the Notice of Intent to Reject,
and there is no evidence that the ESIA was ever reviewed by Balochistan before this
arbitration; only in the quantum phase of this arbitration did Respondent start to allege
that the ESIA failed to comply with local law or international standards and would have

prevented Claimant from seeking financing. !?°

According to Claimant, Respondent’s experts Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor fail to quantify
the impact of the alleged shortcomings and also do not take into account the additional

adjustments made by Prof. Davis to account for risks associated with possible
environmental and social impacts.'?°> In addition, Claimant argues that the complaints
raised by Respondent’s experts should be dismissed because: (i) contrary to the
statements made in their reports, Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor performed only “a superficial
review of only a portion of the record selected in advance by Pakistan’s counsel, and then
became uncritical advocates for Pakistan’s positions, including on issues outside their
experience or competence”, (ii) the Parties’ experts are in agreement on “the core issues
concerning the rigor and reliability of the work conducted by TCC and its consultants,”
with Respondent’s experts only disputing the conclusions reached which could have been
resolved through an iterative process; and (iii) Respondent’s allegations of shortcomings
or flaws are contradicted by Claimant’s expert Ms. Cessford and the “extensive
contemporaneous analyses reflected both in the documents Pakistan’s experts reviewed

and those that they ignored.”'?*

With regard to the documents reviewed by Respondent’s experts, Claimant refers to Ms.
Filas’ testimony that she had personally reviewed only “a good number of them,” which
she did not “go through ... in detail,” and that she had decided not to review “thousands
of pages” stating that she could judge from the context of the document that it “wasn’t
going to contribute to [her] opinion.” According to Claimant, Dr. Connor also confirmed
that she did not inquire about or verify the accuracy and veracity of the documents
provided to her.!7°5 In addition, Claimant notes that neither expert asked to be provided
with additional documents and refers to Ms. Filas’ statement that she did not see the need
for such a request for her “high-level” review as well as Ms. Connor’s statement that it
was irrelevant if the socio-political and security risks that she considered to be not

adequately addressed in the ESIA were discussed in “35 other places” in Claimant’s

studies, !7°

962. Referring to Ms. Filas’ labelling of Claimant’s ESIA as only a “plan-for-a-plan” and her

argument that instead a detailed Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS)
would have been required, Claimant notes that a contemporaneous report provided to Dr.
Connor expressly noted that a “preliminary deadline date” for a “fully operational
Environmental Management System” had been set for the end of December 2010.!?°7
Claimant further claims that Dr. Connor’s criticism regarding an alleged failure to address

potential opposition to Claimant’s acquisition of land for the pipeline ignored the
testimony of Respondent’s witnesses and Respondent’s exhibits confirming that there
were “virtually no implications for land acquisition” given the sparse population of the

land, !28

Claimant considers it agreed between the Parties and their experts that it applied the
correct laws and guidelines in preparing the ESIA and that it correctly applied generally
accepted ESIA methodology given that Ms. Filas “did not take exception to the general
methodology ... used in conducting the ESIA analysis,” Dr. Connor agreed that the ESTA.
consultation “followed the usual protocols,” and Respondent confirmed at the Hearing on
Quantum that it does not “challenge [the] methodology” applied by Claimant.'?°

Claimant further refers to Ms. Cessford’s testimony that the process of assessing and
managing environmental and social impacts is a “cyclical process ... based on the
knowledge ... available at the time” which is contunously checked reassessed
“throughout construction and operation, and then finally again at the end of the life-of-
mine.” Claimant points out that Dr. Connor agreed that “it’s a[n] iterative process,” and
that Ms. Filas confirmed that it “generally and typically evolve[s] over the life of the
project.” Finally, Claimant also considers it agreed that the process if characterized by a
“back and forth” between the company and the regulators or lenders until the impacts are

managed in a satisfactory manner.!?!°

As a result of the Parties’ experts’ agreement on these issues, Claimant claims that: (i)
there can be no dispute about the reliability of the results on which the ESIA team relied
in reaching their conclusions and recommendations; (ii) Respondent cannot fault
Claimant for not completing steps in the process “which—by practice and design—would
only come after the grant of the mining lease which Balochistan wrongfully withheld’;
and (iii) the allegation raised by Respondent’s experts that any of the supposed flaws
would have been “fatal” or “non-starters” for the project is contradicted by the reality of

routine ongoing consultations with funders or regulators.!?!!

In this regard, Claimant also refers to Ms. Cessford’s explanation that “both regulators
and investors have mechanisms by which any perceived shortfalls in the ESIA process
can be addressed without a regular resorting to rejecting an ESIA or refusing the overall

project outright.”'?!? Claimant also refers to Pakistan’s own Guidelines for the
preparation and review of Environmental Reports which recognize the availability of
“appropriate remedial options” to address specific inadequacies of the environmental
report.!?!3 Referring to Ms. Cessford, Claimant submits that in that case funding can be
approved subject to “conditions incorporated into the loan agreement, usually in the form
of an environmental and social action plan (ESAP)” and argues that there is no reason
why this would not have been possible in case of inadequacies in Claimant’s ESIA.'?!4

967. In any event, Claimant maintains that none of the technical flaws alleged by Respondent
and its experts exists. Claimant emphasizes that, contrary to Ms. Filas’ criticism, there is
no requirement under Pakistani law or international guidelines that an ESIA report at
development stage has to include concrete managements systems and refers to guidelines
issued by the International Finance Corporation which allow a company to “develop[]
and implement{] [an ESMS] over a reasonable period of time as agreed with the IFC” if
it did not have “a satisfactory Management System at the time of IFC’s appraisal of the

project.”!?'5

968. Claimant further contends that while Respondent’s experts criticized Claimant’s ESIA
for failing to meet Pakistan’s standards and guidelines with regard to environmental and
social matters, neither of them is qualified to express an opinion on such standards given
Ms. Filas’ concession that she was “not an expert on Pakistan requirements” and Dr.
Connor’s “limited, dated, and irrelevant” in-country experience. !?!° Claimant further
considers this criticism disproved by standard industry practice and Ms. Cessford’s
testimony that Claimant’s selection of locations for monitoring impact of air emissions
was based on the objective “to generate a background concentration” and to
communicate to the stakeholders the likely direct air quality impacts.'?!’ According to
Claimant, these locations represented “the most densely-populated areas near the marine
terminal, which were most likely to impact a large group of stakeholders” and were
therefore “appropriate and suitable” to meet that goal.'?!® Claimant further refers to Ms.
Cessford’s explanation that “the ESIA report [not only] specifically discussed impacts on
the closest current receptors,” but also “presented dispersion plume figures showing the
concentration plumes at other locations, including across the project site and beyond.”

According to Ms. Cessford, the impact can be ascertained at any point of the graphic

image of the marine terminal and not only at the monitoring locations. !7!°

In this regard, Claimant also contends that Respondent misunderstands the ambient limit
standards set out in the EDC in that they do not apply to the ESIA’s air quality impact
assessment for the mine site, which is an occupational zone and therefore subject to
occupational health standards with which Claimant has complied in committing to a
separate study under the Health & Safety management system; by contrast, the ambient
level values in the ESIA are “significantly below” the ambient limit standards.!??°
Claimant further notes that its model of the dispersion of the emissions was provided by
Lorax Environmental, a marine specialist and water quality expert, and rejects the
suggestion that it manipulated the testing of emission levels by not using the levels at the
discharge point. According to Claimant, measuring concentration of metals at the end of

the mixing zone is consistent with international standard practice.!??!

Claimant submits that local law requirements were captured in its Environmental Design
Criteria (EDC) but argues that, contrary to Respondent’s argument, compliance with the
EDC is not a requirement under local law or international guidelines. In any event,
Claimant contends that the ESIA “demonstrated compliance with every aspect of the local

requirements that was reasonably practicable.” '??

Claimant also relies on Ms. Cessford’s testimony to argue that its seeking of “a variance”
to the marine effluent standards did not serve to characterize Claimant’s works as faulty,
in particular because the limit in Pakistan’s stated standards appears to have been
erroneously “carried over from the freshwater limit into the marine” and “could actually
be causing a harm to the aquatic life.”'? According to Claimant, seeking relaxation of
a standard for two parameters is recognized by international guidelines; for all others,
Claimant maintains that when comparing the correct values to the “EDC effluent limit,”

the values are equal to or below the stated limits. !?*4

Claimant rejects the allegation that it selected the Fan Sediments as its water source
without considering the impact of its water usage on the competing interests of local
communities. It refers to Mr. Livesey and Mr. Mayer who explained that the water from

the Fan Sediments was not suitable for irrigation or other agricultural purposes and

therefore had no possible alternative economic use.'??>

973. Similarly, Claimant submits that the direct impact of its proposed slurry pipeline on
“groundwater flow patterns” as well as possible indirect impacts on flood irrignation
systems and other water users were specifically considered in the ESIA, which proposed
mitigation measures to undertake further study. Claimant argues that the “[t]he purpose
of the ESIA is to identify and assess material risks” and claims that there is no basis for

Respondent's claim that this assessment was deficient or unacceptable.!?7°

974. As to Ms. Filas’ criticism that Claimant’s mine closure plans would have had to provide
for a complete backfill of the pit, Claimant argues that complete backfilling is not
generally required for pits of the kind contemplated for Reko Diq and the specific
requirement to this effect in California “has long been controversial” and is under
consideration for “substantial revisions.”'??” Claimant points to its conceptual plan for
mine closure and the ESIA and the Feasibility Study as part of which it carried out a high-
level assessment of the likelihood of a pit lake forming at closure and identified the studies

required during the life of the project.!?7*

roads, arguing that, as noted in the ESIA, it was not provided with the relevant

information by the Pakistani authorities. !??°

plans or two qualified personnel to supervise and implement them, Claimant refers to its
demonstration at the Hearing on Quantum of “the incredible breadth and detail of the

proving that it had already started to implement these plans and would deliver on its
commitments.” Claimant also refers to Dr. Connor’s admission that she was not aware

regard.'?*° Claimant argues that it was committed to engaging with all relevant

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

978. Respondent notes that Claimant recognized in the Feasibility Study that “the main
challenge in Reko Dig is to obtain the social license to operate from the communities,
authorities and all the relevant stakeholders.” According to Respondent, however,
Claimant did not have a comprehensive plan in place in order to obtain and maintain the
social license but relied primarily on “a high-level review of the socio-political and
economic environment and hypothetical support based on a range of benefits it planned
to provide.”'?*> Respondent refers to its social license specialist Dr. Connor who pointed
out that Claimant “followed the wrong process, used the wrong people, and poorly
executed what little work it tried to do.”'>4

979. According to Respondent, Claimant: “(J) had no comprehensive plan to mitigate the
public’s concerns and provide benefits; (2) failed to understand the socio-political
conditions in the area and the Resource’s role in exacerbating already existing tensions;
(3) failed to sufficiently engage the affected communities or involve them in strategic
decision making during the consultation process; and (4) underestimated what it would

take to obtain a social license and maintain it.”!?>

980. Respondent claims that Claimant’s ESIA failed to conform to the IFC Performance
Standards and Equator Principles as well as to its own Environmental Design Criteria
(EDC) in various areas as a result of which it would not have been able to seek funding

and would not have been able to obtain political risk insurance. '*°

981.

Respondent relies on Dr. Connor’s testimony that “the information on baseline social
conditions is completely inadequate” and that the ESIA ignored the conflict situation in
Balochistan and thereby also the potential of the project further exacerbating existing

conflicts.!?*” Dr. Connor pointed out that the ESIA provides only a “brief and superficial
description of conflict in Balochistan” and does not identify terrorism or insurgent activity
as a risk to Claimant’s operations but focuses on social ills which reveals “a profound
misunderstanding of the project.”'?** In addition, Respondent argues that, as pointed out
by Dr. Connor, there were no mitigation measures to manage potential social conflict with
or among the tribes or to deal with militant organizations; there was also no analysis of
the adverse impacts of the projects and whether these would be outweighed by the
benefits that Claimant would provide. !”*° With regard to the alleged benefits, Respondent
quotes from Dr. Connor’s testimony that she found no information on:

[H]ow that was analyzed, who did it, who determined that was the right thing

to do, who determined that wasn’t the wrong thing to do that would divide

and cause more conflict, who determined how they were going to figure out

what the recipients have, because if you give the wrong thing to the wrong

group, you may have a war on your hands. I didn’t see any evidence of any

staff that were doing any sort-of-kind-of-even anywhere close to the kind of

assessment that needed to be done.”'?*°
In particular, Respondent criticizes that the ESTA did not outline an implementation plan
and that there was no ESMS in place, which resulted in the lack of an organizational
structure to analyze and implement a social license plan. Respondent refers to Ms. Filas’
testimony that “JFC, in particular, will require a management system to be fleshed out to
a certain level as part of the initial presentation of the ESIA” and argues that despite
Claimant’s reference to a deadline for a “fully operational ESMS completed by the end of
December 2010,” there was no evidence of any further steps taken towards completion
of the ESMS by November 2011.!24!

Respondent contends that Claimant’s approach to community relationships and social
management programs was “at best haphazard” and refers to Dr. Connor’s conclusion
that it “did not have anywhere near the right staff to develop” the project. Respondent
notes that Claimant would have required, inter alia, a “conflict management expert’ and
argues that this was not only a question of additional costs but also the delay in “finding
and putting in place the right individuals.”'?* Respondent also refers to the observations

made by a consultant reviewing the community outreach process which, according to
Respondent, “counter any idea that TCC had in place a robust community relations
991243

plan.

984. According to Dr. Connor, Claimant would have required “a very skilled manager, not
only a community relations expert...but a manager. And that only happens when you put
it within the confines of an Environmental and Social Management Plan.” Respondent
considers it undisputed that no such management system was developed as Ms. Cessford
admitted that “an environmental social management system ... was being developed by
TCC and stopped at the point that the Project ceased.” Referring to Ms. Filas, Respondent
contends that the management system was required by relevant international standards
but Claimant instead only had a “plan for a plan” which was not in accordance with these

standards. !244

985. In response to Claimant’s reference to other documents besides the ESIA and community
initiatives, Respondent points to Dr. Connor’s explanation that she did not have to go
further than the ESIA because it did not contain the information that a lender would want
to see and a lender would therefore have requested that the ESIA be completely redone.
According to Respondent, Claimant’s community initiatives were insufficient in the
absence of an adequate impact assessment to determine what benefits would be necessary
to obtain a social license from the community. Respondent claims that “the contributions
and expenditures TCC outlined in slides 104 and 105 of their opening presentation does
little to show that TCC understood the social risks, assessed those risks, and properly

planned to mitigate those risks.”'?>

986. Respondent considers that this conclusion is also confirmed by Ms. Filas who testied that
“Tb]lased on the status of the programs in the ESIA, this Project ... would be extremely
challenged to gain public support, which is needed to get you social license to operate”
as well as by Prof. Rais who did not think that “these social development programs and
community development ... will satisfy the Baloch, who have long list of grievances.” '?*

Respondent also refers to Mr. Davies who testified that “uniform negative feedback

provided to us by community representatives indicated that TCC likely failed to engage

in a way that would have positively influenced community perceptions” and to Mr. Owen

who also concluded that Claimant had not adequately engaged with the local communities

and failed to understand the tribal culture in Balochistan. !747

Respondent acknowledges that Claimant “performed some consultation work with local
communities and gathered some locat data,” but maintains that Claimant failed to allocate
adequate resources to the consultation process and failed to address the community
concerns in a meaningful way as they were simply passed on and no follow up was made.
Referring to Dr. Connor, Respondent contends that Claimant had set up a formal
grievance procedure but failed to properly implement it. Respondent also asserts that
Claimant ignored concerns raised by its own community relations team regarding the
hiring of outsiders for security posts and claims that “[t]he community’s negative

perception of TCC was evident.”'>**

Respondent contends that Dr. Connor’s conclusions are also confirmed by
contemporaneous documents referring to labor disputes, community protests, hunger
strikes, a terrorist attack, and bullying of local journalists all of which involved or were
directed at Claimant. Respondent also refers to a statement in the Forward Work Plan in
the Feasibility Study which confirms in its view that Claimat had not engaged with
“stakeholders in the communities of the pipeline area, Gwadar and in water affected

areas.”

According to Respondent, Claimant failed to make specific commitments in response to
concerns raised in the public consultation process, planned to make only limited
contributions that were not part of a comprehensive plan and also failed to deliver on its
promises to commit to “Jocal employment” and “local procurement.” Respondent
considers that Claimant therefore had no way to confirm that the community would have
supported its project.'?°° In addition, Respondent claims that Claimant had not prepared
for the challenge of training locals for the jobs it planned to provide during construction
and operation and therefore would not have had a ready labor force to start construction,
which could delay the project and “fuel the existing tension between TCC and the local

1251

population. Respondent also considers that the ESIA should have evaluated

opportunities for developing the local infrastructure, in particular roads to accommodate

the additional traffic, instead of proposing to set a fly-in/fly-out camp isolating the project
from the local communities. 77

Respondent emphasizes that “social license issues are key in considering the viability of
a mining project” and claims that “[i]n practice, failure to obtain a social license has
caused mining operations to cease or at the very least suspend work.” Respondent refers
to Prof. Dagdelen who identified numerous project failures worldwide due to a failure to
obtain a social license and argues that a buyer would therefore consider social license “as
one of the most important considerations in deciding whether to proceed with Reko Dig.”
Respondent notes that Claimant has not disputed the importance of obtaining and
maintaining a social license; in its view, risks relating to the lack of a social license cannot
be incorporated into a modern DCF model and therefore render the project’s value

“speculative, at best.”!?3

With regard to Claimant’s ESIA, Respondent argues that it was not in compliance with
the IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles, which made it unacceptable to
international lenders and the affected community, and points to the following
“deficiencies”: “there was a secret sludge dump, TCC circumvented points of compliance
to measure water and air discharges, the discharges were not within the prescribed limits
of Pakistani law, there were no management plans for mitigation, and mitigation costs
were not included in either the ESIA or the IMD FS.”'?4

Respondent considers it undisputed that the ESTA would have had to comply with local
law and internationally recognized standards, both of which are acknowledged in the
EDC, and refers to Ms. Cessford’s testimony that “ESJAs must also satisfy policy

consid ions in additi

to the legal requi ‘s im] d by Pakistani national and
regional governments,” which include “internationally recognized guidelines on
GIIP...additional requirements or obligations imposed by financial lenders, and
commitments made to stakeholders.” In Respondent’s view, Claimant therefore also had
to comply with its EDC which sets compliance targets adopted and referenced in the

ESIA.!255

Respondent argues that lenders expect the ESIA to “meet host country requirements”;
however, Claimant’s ESIA failed to comply with: (i) national standards for water quality
discharge at the Port of Gwadar; (ii) IFC and Pakistan’s guidelines for pollution control

of NOx emissions; (iii) the 2002 BM Rules regarding the backfilling of pits; and (iv) the

IFC guidelines for assessing the impact of high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.!2°°

994. In Respondent’s view, there is no dispute that compliance with the relevant standards
required the emissions and discharges to be measured at source; Claimant, however, did
not adequtately locate the points of compliance for assessing air quality and in its
dispersion model at the closest point of access or the property boundary. Claimant also
did not set the monitoring points in locations with the nearest receptors and thereby acted

contrary to the local law.'257

995. As for water discharge, Respondent considers that Claimant conceded that it could not
meet national standards (let alone its own Environmental Design Criteria) as it required
a variance for two metals “with little to no justification.” It further claims that, “in many
cases, TCC was planning to discharge metals that were thousands of times the ocean
background levels,” i.e., 10,000 for copper, 7,800 for lead, 3,750 for nickel and 10,050
for zinc and significantly exceeded the EDC limits. Respondent also contends that
Claimant failed to consider the cumulative impact of the metals it planned to discharge
over the life of the project on the fisheries and refers to its expert Dr. Ault who pointed
out that Claimant’s modelling studies were “insufficient” and the “risks posed to the local
ecosystems and local populations are unquantified.”'?*

996. Respondent contends that neither the ESIA nor the Feasibility Study include plans for
mitigation and, therefore, the costs for mitigating the adverse effects or emissions, water
discharge, sludge treatment and removal were no adequately reflected in the Feasibility
Study. Respondent emphasizes that Claimant recognized in the Feasibility Study that the
environmental impacts of the project “could affect the health and welfare of the
communities” and that “some of the impacts would not be able to be reduced to acceptable
levels’’; the ESIA, however, failed to identify or address these areas of non-compliance.
As an example, Respondent considers it confirmed by Mr. Livesey that Claimant had no
plans for treating and disposing of the wastewater treatment sludge and merely speculated
that it would be “an authorized facility in the Port of Gwadar area”; however, there was

no analysis of the amount of sludge or its chemical characteristics and no estimate of the
costs for treatment and disposal.'?° Similarly, Respondent claims that while Claimant
recognized the “potential loss of income from fishing near the site for discharge of water
in the ocean at Port Gwadar” and identified as a source of “tension and discord in the
local communities,” it failed to assess the impact on the fisheries and failed to account for

any mitigation costs in this regard.'?°°

Respondent also contends that the ESIA failed to evaluate mitigation measures to reduce
or eliminate the public concerns raised as required under the IFC standards and refers to
Ms. Filas’ opinion that any “mitigation measures were limited to generalized statements
regarding economic development, establishing communications between TCC and local

communities and Project monitoring.”'°!

Referring to Ms. Filas, Respondent contends that the management system plans missing
in the ESIA are critical in that they “define what would need to be done to implement
those commitments that are made in the ESIA, in order to make and adequate estimate of
the costs.” Ms. Cessford conceded that the ESIA did not include an environmental
mitigation budget but stated that “there are numbers presented in the Feasibility Study
for it’; however, the Feasibility Study was completed almost six months before the ESTA

and there were no costs in the Feasibility Study, e.g., for the proposed sludge disposal

environmental mitigation costs” is “completely unrealistic in light of the ESIA’s

 

deficiencies” and notes that OPEX G&A costs reflect only environmental monitoring but
expressly exclude environmental closure cos

  

. As a result, Respondent claims that the
mitigation costs required during the operation of the mine “are severely understated and
in most cases are missing.”'?® According to Respondent, the same therefore also applies
to Prof. Davis’ model, which “only addressed three discreet areas, which did not include
water aquifer reinjection, training of low-skilled workers, sludge treatment and disposal,

air and discharge emission controls, just to name a few.”'?*

999. Respondent further contends that Claimant’s ESIA failed to meet the formal requirements
under the IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles and notes that Ms. Cessford
testified only that “it aligned with the IFC Performance Standards” and referred to the
Feasibility and other unnamed draft documents that would together with ESIA meet the
applicable international standards.'*° Respondent points to Ms. Filas’ identification of
“the key areas” where the ESIA did not meet international standards and her conclusion
that it would therefore not have met lender or regulatory requirements as of the valuation
date.'?® Specifically, Ms. Filas stated:

“They haven’t provided justifications, in particular, for greenhouse gas, for
NOx emissions and for the concentrate effluent, and failure to adequately
address public concerns regarding aquifer depletions, air emissions, the
quality of water into the fishery, and the toxic mine water that would have
been left at the end of the closure period.”'?%"

1000. Respondent also refers to Ms. Filas’ testimony that the ESIA itself would have had to
provide an evaluation of the transboundary water drawdown in Afghanistan and an
assessment on security in order to meet the IFC Performance Standards.'?® According to
Respondent, Claimant understated the risks and impact associated with: (i) the extraction
of water from the Fan Sediments; (ii) the safety and security issues in Balochistan; (iii)
the greenhouse gas emissions from the mine that would amount to almost 1% of
Pakistan’s overall greenhouse emissions; (iv) the environmental impacts to the marine
life in the Arabian sea; (v) transboundary impacts on Afghanistan; and (vi) the health
impacts on the employees. !?°

1001.Respondent submits that both of its experts reached the conclusion that Claimant’s ESTA
was not lender ready: (i) Ms. Filas stated that she could “tell by the content of what’s in
the ESIA today whether its lender ready. And this one was not”; and (ii) Dr. Connor stated
that the ESIA would need to be “redone” because it has not “identified all the impacts”
and does not give “the reader ... enough information to reach a conclusion about whether

... to invest or not.”!27

1002.Respondent agrees with Claimant that the assessment of a project’s environmental and
social impacts is a dynamic and iterative process. It notes that the ESIA is submitted to
both the local authorities for permits needed for the project as well as to financiers and
adds that “[a]s the local authorities and the financiers make changes to the ESIA, the
ESIA normally goes through various drafts. With each draft, the requirements imposed
by the financiers and the government may require changes to the mine plan, and the
mitigation costs related with certain compliance requirements can materially impact the

mine, if not make the mine uneconomic to operate.”'>”'

1003. Respondent emphasizes that Claimant planned to start construction less than a year later
and, as of November 2011, “the ESIA was not complete, lacked many of elements that
lenders would require, and did not include a plan for managing environmental
mitigation.” Referring to Ms. Filas, Respondent maintains that the ESIA was only a “plan
for a plan” which, in Respondent’s view, “could have equally been used for any other
project,” and further maintains that “JFC would have required at the very least a draft
management plan.” Specifically, Respondent refers to Ms. Filas testimony that, drawing
on her experience of working with IFC, “the IFC ... would expect to see a management
system. I believe that this Guidance note is saying that it doesn’t have to be complete and
final, but it needs to address those elements that are time-dependent.”'?” According to
Respondent, this management system is required for “any significant impacts that require
mitigation” and should address non-compliant air and water discharges, occupational

health and safety plans and security measures to protect the work site and the workers.!?73

1004. Respondent notes that Ms. Filas identified these deficiencies of the ESIA during a high-
level review and observed that “‘it is conceivable that the project's ESIA may be rejected
outright, without necessary conducting a detailed review of its content.” Respondent
argues that a buyer would also have detected these shortcomings and likely have required
the presentation of effective management systems before accepting the ESIA. Respondent
also submits that lenders would have found these deficiencies “at the very least
problematic” and curing them would have resulted in additional costs for Claimant (as

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

1005.The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ dispute regarding the Environmental and Social

Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the Reko Diq Project, which was prepared and completed

for submission to the authorities in November 2010, concerns several issues, which are

to some extent intertwined. Respondent and its experts take the position that the ESIA

did not contain all of the elements required under the relevant international standards that

regulatory authorities and lenders would have expected to see in an ESIA when

considering whether to approve or provide funding to the project. In addition, Respondent

and its experts have raised concerns with regard to certain impacts that are addressed in

the ESIA but would, in their opinion, not have been considered acceptable by the

authorities and/or lenders.

1006. There is no dispute between the Parties’ experts that the relevant international standards

are the Equator Principles, and the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC)

Performance Standards. With regard to the environmental impact assessment, Ms.

Cessford and Ms. Filas both also made reference to Pakistan’s National Environmental

Quality Standards (NEQS).

1007. As pointed out by Claimant, there further appears to be agreement between the Parties

regarding the methodology applied by Claimant’s consultants in preparing the ESTA. Ms.

Filas confirmed in her second report:

“Filas Engineering agrees that it did not take exception to the general
methodology that SRK Consulting UK Ltd and Hagler Bailly Pakistan Pvt.
Ltd used in conducting the ESIA analysis. The impact analysis methodology
used appeared to be conventional. Due to the high-level nature of our review,
Filas Engineering did not conduct a technical review of the various modeling
efforts nor did we take exception to their process. We did, however, express
concern regarding the proper assessment of specific issues and in the
comprehensiveness of the ESIA content relative to Equator Principles IFC
Performance Standard expectations.” '?"°

1008.Dr. Connor stated in her report with regard to the consultation of stakeholders:

“TCC identified stakeholders, conducted consultations between March 2008
and October 2009 with various stakeholders including a selection of
communities in three affected areas, developed a Grievance Mechanism, and
prepared an initial Public Consultation and Development Plan (PCDP)
developed during the Scoping phase. Consultation information in the ESIA
and PCDP indicates that TCC followed the usual protocols.”'?"®

1009. However, Dr. Connor also noted the following:

275 Filas IL, 78.
'216 Connor, Section 2.2.2, { 1.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 343 of 1447
Award
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -332-

“The different formats used and the brevity of the descriptions of stakeholder
participation (particularly at the community level), however, inhibit judging
the acceptability of the consultation process at that stage and as described in
the documents in terms of its scope, extent, methodologies and the level of
representativeness of the participation. A reasonable judgment would have
required more clarity in identifying the extent and scope of consultation.”'>”

1010. While Respondent’s experts therefore made certain caveats regarding their acceptance of
the methodology and process followed, the Tribunal considers that in the absence of any
specific objection in this regard, it has no basis to find that the ESTA process itself, i.e.,
the manner in which information was collected and assessed to determine the
environmental and social impacts of the project,would have given a buyer or a lender
cause for concern.

1011.Before turning to the criticisms raised by Respondent’s experts on the contents of the
ESIA, the Tribunal also notes that there was agreement between all experts that the
assessment of environmental and social impacts is characterized by an iterative process
that continues throughout the life of the project. They are in disagreement, however, as
to the question which level of information, in particular when it comes to mitigation
measures and a management system, has to be included in the ESIA, which is prepared
before the start of construction, in order to be considered acceptable by the relevant
authorities and potential lenders.

1012. Respondent itself confirmed in this regard that when an ESIA is submitted to the relevant
authorities and lenders, it is not yet set in stone; it expressly noted that “[a]s the local
authorities and the financiers may make changes to the ESIA, the ESIA normally goes
through various drafts.”'?78 Ms. Filas stated in her second report, however, that “[i]f the
Project does not propose adequate environmental controls and does not enjoy local
support, it is conceivable that its ESIA may be rejected outright, without necessarily
conducting a detailed review of its content.”!?”

1013.Ms. Cessford explained at the Hearing on Quantum that the expectation of what would
occur after the submission of the ESIA to the Balochistan authorities was as follows:

“The ESIA team had actually been scoped to interact with the regulator post-
submission, the regulator in this case being the Balochistan Environmental
Protection Agency. We had also been scoped to undertake the feedback
stakeholder of consultation, which is a very important stage in the process,
whereby the outcome of the ESIA is presented to stakeholders so they can
understand how the issues that they raised in the Scoping Stage have been
addressed and what the plans are moving forward with the Project.

This was to take place in parallel with the Public Hearing, which is the
regulatory requirement, in terms of the Balochistan environmental
requirements. In addition to that, we were expecting to have to, as part of our
work with the interaction with the stakeholders and the regulators--to
possibly have to make amendments to the ESIA. That is quite common as a
result of these engagement activities. And then, also, we had been scoped with
providing input into TCC's development of their Management Plans.”!?°°

1014.Ms. Filas noted in her second report that “i]t is true that a regulatory authority such as
the Pakistan EPA can review an ESIA report and reject certain portions of its content
and request additional information on those aspects that are not fully explained.” In her
opinion, however, the environmental issues she had identified “would likely be a non-
starter in most countries.”!*8! She further confirmed her opinion that “[t]o propose a
massive use of water resources in a hyperarid environment with little to no environmental
controls on air emissions and water discharges without adequate justification would
likely be a non-starter for the Pakistan EPA, the IFC and potential private investment

firms. 182

1015. With regard to the review of the ESIA by the competent regulatory authority, which she
confirmed to be the Balochistan EPA, Ms. Filas noted at the Hearing on Quantum that
she was “not an expert on Pakistan requirements” and that she did “not have experience
submitting these ESIAs to the Balochistan EPA.” She clarified that her opinion was based
on her expectation “that any Regulatory Authority would expect justification for the
presentations that are made. So, it doesn’t require experience in Balochistan to have a
reasonable expectation that they would behave in the manner that most regulators around
the world do.”'?*> Ms. Filas further confirmed that she had not asked for information
about the record of the Balochistan EPA in reviewing ESIAs but was aware of the ESIA
for the earlier Tanjeel project at Reko Diq which had been approved. Claimant pointed
out to Ms. Filas that it had asked for but was not provided with any other ESIA submitted
to the Balochistan EPA and that the Tanjeel ESIA was therefore the only ESIA in the
record. It further pointed out that the Saindak mine, which has been operating in
Balochistan for a number of years, therefore appeared to be allowed to operate without
having an approved ESIA.'?8+ When presented with this information, Ms. Filas
maintained her opinion that “the term ‘non-starter’ ... it’s an accurate statement because

environmental controls on air emissions and water discharges without adequate

justification would likely be a non-starter.” She further clarified that “if you’re not going
to mitigate, ... if you’re going to require variances to the expectations by the lenders and
government ... and you don’t provide adequate justification for those, then it’s likely to
be a nonstarter because that’s what regulators and lenders do.”'?*> Ms. Filas testified
that “[w]hat happened with the Saindak mine is not relevant to whether or not the Reko
Dig ESIA is lender ready”; she clarified that she had not been testifying about regulatory
approval in her second report but rather that “/enders will defer to the Host Country
requirements. You have to meet Host Country requirements, and you have to meet lender

expectations.”'?86

1016.Ms. Filas’ oral testimony made clear that she did not base her opinion that the ESIA in its
current form “would likely be non-starter for the Pakistan EPA” on any specific practices
of the competent provincial authority in Balochistan but rather on a more general
expectation of how a regulatory authority would react to the environmental impact of the
project as presented in the ESIA. At the end of her testimony, Ms. Filas further clarified
that she did not really express an opinion on whether regulatory approval would be denied
but rather whether non-conformities with the environmental requirements in Pakistan
would result in lenders refusing to fund the project.

1017.On that basis, the Tribunal sees no reason to assume that the ESIA would have been
rejected by the Balochistan EPA. As Ms. Cessford testified, Claimant expected that
interactions with the authority would be required after submission of the ESIA, that there
would be a public hearing in accordance with the regulatory requirements, and that they
would “possibly have to make amendments to the ESIA,” which she considered “quite
common.”'7 As noted above, Respondent itself submitted that “the ESIA normally goes
through various drafts” as, inter alia, “the government may require changes to the mine
plan.”'?88 There is no indication that the Balochistan EPA would not have engaged in
such a dialogue with Claimant in the absence of Respondent’s Treaty breaches. In
addition, as was also pointed out by Claimant, Balochistan’s authorities did not raise any
concern with regard to the environmental or social impact of the project after the ESIA
had been submitted together with TCCP’s Mining Lease Application in February 2011.
No concern in this regard was included in the reasons provided by the Licensing Authority
in its Notice of Intent to Reject and there is no evidence of a concern being raised at any
point prior to this arbitration.

1018.In the Tribunal’s view, the more relevant question is therefore whether the content of the
ESIA and the proposed measures to mitigate the impact identified in the ESIA would

have been considered by lenders to be in conformity with international standards and, if
not, whether they would have required significant additional measures and, thus,
additional costs to be included before agreeing to fund the project. In this regard, Ms.
Cessford testified at the Hearing on Quantum that with regard to expected interactions
with investors, the ESIA team had only been scoped to produce a “Glorified Executive
Summary” of the ESIA, which she described as “a much longer Executive Summary,
suitable for investors that explained the process and the interaction with the project
engineers.” She further testified:

“In addition to that, although we had not been scoped in this case, based on

my other experience on other projects, we had expected to have interactions

with any investors, respond to questions, possibly undertake additional

studies, such as on issues they raised, and to develop action plans to address

any gaps that they might identify that they felt needed further work.”'?8°

1019.Ms. Cessford’s testimony makes clear that Claimant and its consultants expected at the
time that additional work might be necessary before the ESIA would be considered
satisfactory. It is also apparent to the Tribunal that additional work might result in
additional costs, be it due to substantial further work on the ESIA and/or due to additional
mitigation measures that might have to be included following the interactions with
investors and authorities. One question that will be addressed below is therefore whether
Claimant and/or Prof. Davis included adequate contingency for such additional costs and
possibly also delays in the start of construction.

1020. However, as noted above, Ms. Filas expressed the opinion in her second report that “[i]f
the Project does not propose adequate environmental controls and does not enjoy local
support, it is conceivable that its ESIA may be rejected outright, without necessarily
conducting a detailed review of its content” and that by proposing “a massive use of water
resources in a hyperarid environment with little to no environmental controls on air
emissions and water discharges without adequate justification,” the ESTA would likely
have been “a non-starter for ... the IFC and potential private investment firms.”!?°°

1021.Dr. Connor testified at the Hearing on Quantum:

“So, let me tell you what would happen if this ESIA would have gone to a
lender, whether it's me or anybody else. They would have said, This ESIA has
to be--or SIA has to be completely redone. You haven't identified all the
impacts, and things like land aren't even addressed in it. You haven't properly
addressed the significance, and you haven't given the reader or me or anyone
else enough information to reach a conclusion about whether I would want
to invest or not.”'?*!

1022.It became clear at the Hearing on Quantum that the opinion expressed by both of
Respondent’s experts, i.e., that the ESIA was so deficient that it would likely not even
have formed the basis for further discussions with the lenders as described by Ms.
Cessford, was based on the consideration that certain information required under the
relevant international standards had to be included specifically in the ESTA and not in any
other part of the documentation of the project, in particular the Feasibility Study.

1023.Ms. Filas clarified at the Hearing on Quantum that she had not been retained to provide
an assessment of any gaps contained in the work done by Claimant and its consultants
but rather of “gaps ... in the content of the ESIA relative to lender expectations.” In
response to the question whether she had considered whether any such gaps might be
filled in other documents, Ms. Filas confirmed that she had “/ooked at the ESIA as a
stand-alone document” and that her “task was to look at the ESIA and understand and
advise on whether or not it was complete and technically adequate.”'?°? Ms. Filas added
that she had also looked at “the background information” and whether “what was
presented in the ESIA was a reasonable translation and summary of what was in the
supporting documents.” Specifically with regard to the situation of conflict in
Balochistan, which she considered to be “so downplayed in the ESIA itself,’ Ms. Filas
explained that she had also reviewed Chapter 19 of the Feasibility Study on Security and
testified: “7 looked at the representation in the Feasibility Study, and it was represented
more like what I was expecting to see, where terrorists and militant groups were active
in the area, which was more like what I was expecting to see.”'?> Ms. Filas further
confirmed that the list of documents she had reviewed was not a comprehensive set of
documents for the Reko Digq project but expressed the opinion:
“T don't think it was necessary to ask for more documents to come to the
conclusions that I came to. My review was done at a high level, and I could
see that if this document were to be submitted to the regulators and disclosed
to the public, it would have been cause for confusion that would have required
additional attention being devoted to this document.”'?+

1024. When asked whether this additional attention would have come in the course of the
iterative conversations and dialogue she had referred to earlier, Ms. Filas confirmed that

“Ti]t would have come through that process” but maintained the opinion that “typically

you will complete that work before you submit the document for regulatory review.” '?%

1025.Dr. Connor also testified at the Hearing on Quantum that she was criticizing a lack of

information in the ESIA itself:

“T thought I didn't have the information. They're supposed to be in the ESIA.
The information is supposed to be in the Social Impact Assessment. That's
where it's meant to be. They said it was finished. It's not there. There's a
difference. It's not supposed to be somewhere else.”'?°®

1026. Dr. Connor emphasized that “[t]here are steps in the financing Project. You will submit

to the lender certain documents at intervals. They will decide whether to go forward at
each of those intervals.” She confirmed that a lender would also have reviewed the
Feasibility Study but maintained that “their purposes are completely different” and that
the “social assessment doesn’t occur until the ESIA until the Social Impact Assessment.
And that document would have to demonstrate to the lender that you are serious and know
what you're doing about the social impacts, particularly those of the nature--the fragile
and delicate nature and volatile nature that I mentioned.”'?°" Dr. Connor then confirmed
that the opinion she had expressed in her report, i.e., that the existing documentation did
not demonstrate a satisfactory grasp of the human environment in which TCC would
operate, particularly the socio-political and conflict conditions, was based only on the
documents she had reviewed and that she “didn’t need to see any other documents.”!?°
She maintained:

“Tf it is meant to be addressed as a social impact in the ESIA, that is where it

goes. It can be 35 other places, but it has to be in the social impact assessment

because that's the document that assesses the risk of that to the Project, and

the risk of the Project to the people in that area.

So, you can have all kinds of background documents. You have--there should
have been. There should have been a very in-depth study of this. That does
not exist. There is a sort of superficial study. But the ESIA is a document that
the bank--you do not ask the lenders to look around for things. They have a
suite of documents they ask for, and that's where it is supposed to be.”'?°°

1027. It is apparent from the testimony of Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor that their review focused

on the ESIA itself and whether this report included the information required under the
relevant international standards, i.e., in particular the Equator Principles and IFC
Performance Standards. However, the Tribunal notes that when Ms. Cessford was asked
whether the ESIA met the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards at the time
it was submitted, she testified as follows:

“IT would say that it aligned with the IFC Performance Standards. My
experience shows that every potential investor has certain things that they are

concerned about, and that varies from investor to investor and from person
to person within the financial institute. So, one never knows exactly how they
are going to interpret it, but it certainly aligned with the process, and it took
a precautionary approach to the items that were covered.

Q. Okay. When you say ‘aligned with the process,’ do you mean that, in your
opinion, it met the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards on
the date of submission, or that it would meet those standards in the future?

A. The Report itself or the Process? Because the IFC Performance Standards,
which support the Equator Principles, outline a process. The ESIA is one step
in that process. So, there isn't a fixed endpoint that you reach. The ESIA was
part of that, and at that point, we stopped, but we were still doing other
activities in parallel with the ESIA that might not be captured in the document
itself.

The document's key purpose is to submit to regulatory authorities, not to meet
the Equator Principles. To meet the Equator Principles and the IFC
Performance Standards, one is doing a process which is captured in multiple
documents, including the Feasibility Study and other documents that may
have been generated throughout the course of that process.”
1028.Ms. Cessford further clarified that in her opinion, the process of preparing the ESIA met
the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards and in terms of content reiterated
that “the content of the ESIA Report is only part of the content that’s needed to meet the
IFC Performance Standards.” She further confirmed that “if you pull in the Feasibility
Study and other additional work that was going on in parallel, then, yes, I believe it would
[meet the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards].” She testified that some
of the additional content she was referring to was contained in the Feasibility Study and

further referred to “draft documents floating around at the time we stopped working.”*°!

1029. Based on Ms. Cessford’s testimony, it appears to be undisputed that the ESIA did not
contain in and of itself all of the information required under the relevant international
standards. The experts expressed deviating opinions as to whether this would have caused
lenders to request additional work on the ESIA on that basis or whether they would also
have been satisfied if the information was included in other documentation such as, in
particular, the Feasibility Study and other reports that Claimant had completed or was
planning to complete before seeking funding from international lenders.

1030. In the Tribunal’s view, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding on this point. Even
if, as Respondent’s experts testified, lenders had required Claimant to include all relevant
information, e.g., on the security and conflict situation in Balochistan, in the ESIA itself
and had not been satisfied that such information was provided in other reports or in the
Feasibility Study, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that these issues could

have been resolved without significant additional costs or significant delay — to the extent
an assessment had been made and the information was therefore already available in a
different part of the documentation.

1031.In the Tribunal’s view, the relevant question is therefore whether Respondent’s experts
identified assessments or plans that would have had to be included in the ESIA under the
relevant international standards but were not made by Claimant or its consultants,
including in other parts of the documentation for the Reko Digq project.

1032.In this regard, Respondent’s expert identified in particular two aspects that they
considered crucial but missing in the ESIA (as well as other parts of the documentation),
i.e., an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) and a community impact
assessment. In addition, Ms. Filas raised various additional concerns regarding the
environmental impacts of the project presented in the ESTA.

i. Whether Claimant Adequately Addressed Environmental and Social
Management

1033. As for environmental and social management, Ms. Filas stated in her second report that
“the management measures proposed in the ESIA were only broad-based generalizations
that would normally be further addressed in environmental and social management
systems. The ESIA did not include these management systems, which is customary for
inclusion in a typical ESIA and mandated by IFC Performance Standard I and Equator
Principle 4, but instead only included a framework for the management systems.
Consequently, the ESIA did not provide adequate information for a reviewer to determine
the effectiveness of the management systems in mitigating environmental impacts.” In
her opinion, “a certain number of the evaluations and impact analyses did not get
completed to a level that meets international best practice or typical lender expectations,”
including “the ‘plan-for-a-plan’ instead of actual management systems to demonstrate
how mitigation will be accomplished.” > Ms. Filas further stated:

“Discipline-specific management plans describe the ‘who, what, where, when
and why’ of implementing mitigation measures. If these are not spelled out,
it is difficult to accurately cost out the management system implementation
costs. This suggests that the costs included in the Feasibility Study financial
model may be insufficient to cover the actions needed to mitigate Project
impacts to acceptable levels once those management plans are adequately
developed.”'>

1034. At the Hearing on Quantum, Ms. Cessford agreed that “[i]n terms of environmental and
social management, the process is laid out in IFC Performance Standard One” and noted

that this process “follows a standard business cycle of plan, do, check, act” with certain
additions. She testified that “all the activities that were undertaken by the ESIA team fall
under the planning aspect of this” and then explained how they “would have expected the
Environmental and Social Management System to have moved forward through this plan,
do, check, act, as it moved towards construction, operation, and then, eventually, its end

1035. Ms. Filas testified in response to this presentation:

“T heard her Opening Presentation, and I fundamentally disagree with the
comments that she made about the ESMS being something that can be put off
until later.

I've been called in on projects, by the IFC in particular, where projects have
done almost identical to this and where they had not done a management
system--and management systems, I agree, they're an iterative process. They
are developed over time and refined over time, but you don't--if you're trying
to comply with Equator and IFC expectations, you have a plan, a
management system plan, and action plan for those key mitigation measures
that you need to be able to demonstrate how you're going to implement them
on the ground.

You don't have a generic plan for a plan that does not address how you do
that, and you don't wait until later, particularly in those areas that are time-
dependent.

going to get those benefits because, in an area of conflict, you're going to
have conflict if you don't respect that.”!3°"

1036.Ms. Filas noted that she did not have experience working with Pakistan but that she had
worked with lenders and “the lenders expect more than what is presented here. IFC is
very clear on that.” As for the opinion expressed in her second report that a “complete
plan” would normally be expected, including by the Government of Pakistan, Ms. Filas
stated that she “would expect that most Governments expect to see ... a complete
document, and there may be some discretion as far as the level of development in--from
country to country. But certainly from a lender perspective and an IFC perspective, I can

assure you that the expectation is higher than a generic plan for a plan.”'>

1037.When pointed to the IFC Performance Standards’ description of the “Social and
Environmental Management System,” which “will incorporate the following elements: (i)
Social and Envir LA ; (ii) I ; (iii) organizational
capacity; (iv) training; (v) community engagement; (vi) monitoring; and (vii)
reporting,” °° Ms. Filas agreed that the ESIA corresponded to the first element and was

 

different from the management program embodied in the second element. Ms. Filas did
not agree, however, that by criticizing the Reko Diq ESIA for not including a full
management plan, she was actually going further than the IFC requires. She stated that “J
think you're splitting hairs here because, as far as I'm concerned, if you were going for
financing at IFC or with an equator lender, you will need to have the management system,
the initial Management System and certain action plans that will mitigate--that will
demonstrate how you intend to mitigate the critical impacts and the time-dependent
impacts.”3'°
1038.Claimant then pointed to the IFC’s guidance notes on the Performance Standards, which
provide with regard to the requirement quoted above:

“The level of detail and complexity of the social and environment

management system and the resources devoted to it will depend on the level

of impacts and risks identified in the social and environmental assessment

and the size and nature of the client’s organization. A satisfactory

Management System appropriate to the nature and scale of the project and

commensurate with the level of social and environmental risks and impacts is

a condition of IFC’s investment. If the client does not have a satisfactory

Management System at the time of IFC’s appraisal of the project, one should
be developed and implemented over a reasonable period of time agreed with
IFC, and be in effect in time to manage project activities financed by IFC.”?"!

1039. With regard to the final sentence of the paragraph quoted above, Ms. Filas testified that
“Tt]hey are giving that provision--my experience in working with IFC has not--has been
that they would expect to see a management system to some level being a project-specific
management system. I believe that this Guidance Note is saying it doesn't have to be
complete and final, but it needs to address those elements that are time-dependent.”

Claimant then pointed to its Quarterly Report on Exploration Activities that ended 30

June 2010, which provided:
“Implementation of Environmental Management System (EMS)

Reko Dig Environmental management system currently is under development.

The preliminary deadline date to have fully operational Environmental

Management System is end of December 2010. It is anticipated that during

November — December status of the EMS implementation will be reviewed by

the owners and in 2011 EMS will be certified according ISO 14001.

The major activities are: [...)?3"°

1040. When asked whether, if she had been reviewing the ESIA for an investor or a regulator,
she would have asked when the company expected to have a fully operational ESMS, Ms.
Filas testified:

“Tf I'm reviewing a document for whether or not it is lender ready, I can tell
by the content of what's in the ESIA today whether it's lender ready. And this
one was not.

Q. Okay. We went through and showed how the IFC Performance Standards
don't actually require a full management plan in the ESIA. I can do the same
exercise with you with the Equator Principles and the Pakistani regulations,
if you would like.

A. You can certainly do that. Guidelines are written the way they're written
so that they give flexibility. My experience, on more than--on several projects
are that the IFC, in particular, will require a management system to be
fleshed out to a certain level as part of the initial presentation of the ESIA.

Q. Even though that's not what the IFC Performance Standards or the
Guidelines say?

A. My Expert Opinion is that the IFC will require that whether they have
easygoing words or not. You will have to make a case for why it's not
necessary if you are not going to include what is required by Performance

Standard I and Equator Principle 4 in the documentation that you're putting
forward as representing those--addressing those elements.”'>\4
1041.Based on the testimony of the Parties’ experts regarding the Environmental and Social

Management System, the Tribunal considers it common ground that the IFC Performance
Standard One requires the implementation of such a Management System. It further
appears to be undisputed that Claimant’s ESIA did not contain the management program
identified in the IFC Performance Standard but that, as stated in Claimant’s June 2010
Quarterly Report, it was aiming to implement an Environmental Management System
(EMS) by December 2010. On the other hand, Claimant has not pointed the Tribunal to
a document demonstrating that this deadline was met and that a fully operational EMS
was completed by the end of 2010 or thereafter.

1042. It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether the EMS was or was not completed and, if
not, whether this was due to events after the delivery of the Feasibility Study to the GOB,
which gave rise to Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty. It is also not entirely clear
whether the scope of the management system that Claimant planned to implement would
be limited to environmental impacts or would also extend to social impacts as required
under IFC Performance Standard One. In any event, however, the Tribunal is not
convinced that a not yet fully operational ESMS would have caused a lender to consider
the ESIA and other documentation of the project so deficient that it would have rejected
the ESIA or requested that it be completely redone. As pointed out by Claimant, the
guidance notes of the IFC Performance Standards state that the absence of a satisfactory
Management System does not mean that funding is necessarily declined but the
Management System should then “be developed and implemented over a reasonable
period of time agreed with IFC, and be in effect in time to manage project activities
financed by IFC.” Ms. Filas confirmed at the Hearing in Quantum that the guidelines “are
written they way they’re written so that they give flexibility’ but maintained that her
experience was that the IFC “will require a management system to be fleshed out to a
certain level as part of the initial presentation of the ESIA.”'3!°

1043. In the Tribunal’s view, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding on this point. Even
if, as Ms. Filas testified, the IFC and other lenders were to require a certain level of
information on the management system to be implemented for the project in the ESIA
and even if, contrary to the Quarterly Report of June 2010, Claimant had not completed
the implementation by the time it would approach lenders, the Tribunal is not convinced
that this would have caused the lenders to decline funding to the project. In the Tribunal’s
view, it is rather reasonable to assume that, as Ms. Cessford expected, interactions would
have followed and based on the requirements and issues raised by the lenders, Claimant

would have had the chance to finalize its plans for a management system in conformity
with the IFC Performance Standards.

1044. The question that remains to be answered is whether this would have resulted in additional
costs that Claimant did not sufficiently account for in its cost estimate for the project. Ms.
Filas testified that the management system would be important in order to determine the
actual costs associated with implementing the mitigation measures identified with regard
to environmental and social impacts. Ms. Cessford confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum
that the “Budget” identified in her illustration of the business cycle under the action item
“Do” in pink color “wasn’t presented in the ESIA” but also stated that “there are numbers
presented in the Feasibility Study for it.” She then clarified:

“The ESIA team did not get to the pink area, but you can't--like with any
aspect of a project, when you do your Feasibility Study, you put costs in.
There were costs presented in the Feasibility Study to handle environmental
and social management ...both Capex and Opex.

They are just not presented in the ESIA. ...
They are presented in the Feasibility Study. ...

And the ESIA team did not develop those costs. TCC developed those
costs.”1316

1045.Ms. Filas stated at the Hearing on Quantum that in her opinion the ESIA would need to
address the shortcomings she had identified and confirmed that this would likely translate
into further outlays from Claimant in terms of capital costs and operating costs. She
further confirmed that she had not given an estimate of what those costs might be for the
following reason:

“T do not give an estimate of what those costs are, but I do know that those
costs are, normally, when you prepare an ESIA, the idea behind--because the
ESIA is being developed concurrently with the Project Feasibility Study, the
action plans for impl. i itigatic sures for the key mitigation that
needs to be done for the Project would typically be accompanied by an
implementation schedule and an implementation budget so that you have the
capital and the Operating Costs quantified based on the commitments of the
Project. And those would be factored into the Feasibility Study Cost
Evaluation.

 

And, to me, the Management System is the piece, the missing piece that would
define what would need to be done to implement those commitments that are
made in the ESIA, in order to make an adequate estimate of costs.”'3""
1046.Ms. Filas confirmed that Ms. Cessford was “absolutely right if she says the ESIA costs
would be factored into the Feasibility Study.” She then referred to a discussion with Ms.

Cessford on the disposal of sludge, which she considered to be “a costly item” for which
“they hadn’t even decided what they were going to do with that.” Ms. Filas further
confirmed that she was not aware whether the additional costs to meet any additional
commitments that Claimant might have to make were already included in the valuation

model prepared by Prof. Davis for this arbitration. '?!*

1047. Based on the experts’ testimony, the Tribunal considers it undisputed that the costs for
handling environmental and social impacts would be included in the Feasibility Study
and not in the ESIA itself. The question is rather whether Claimant had sufficiently
accounted for these costs. Ms. Filas did not provide an estimate of what she would have
considered an adequate budget or which additional costs Claimant should have included
in the Feasibility Study. As will be discussed in further detail below, Dr. Connor also did
not provide an estimate of the “substantial expenditure in cost and time” that she

described as necessary to maintain a social license to operate in Balochistan. '*!?

1048. The Tribunal further notes that Respondent’s experts both testified that they focused their
review on the ESIA and supporting documents and reviewed only certain parts of the
Feasibility Study such as the Chapter on Security. In particular, neither of them engaged
with the cost estimates provided in the Chapters on Capital Costs and Operating Costs,
including the contingencies, nor with the residual risk register and the quantification of
these risks by Claimant and/or by Prof. Davis in his valuation model. Consequently, the
Tribunal has no basis to find that Claimant should have included a specific additional
amount to manage environmental and social impacts.

1049. This does not yet mean, however, that the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant had
sufficiently addressed and accounted for the various individual issues raised by
Respondent’s experts in terms of environmental and social impacts. These will now be
assessed.

ii. Whether Claimant Adequately Addressed the Environmental Impacts of
the Project

1050. As for environmental impacts, Ms. Filas raised criticisms regarding the assessment of the
impact on air quality at the mine area and at the area of Port Gwadar, greenhouse gas
emissions, the water treatment process and resulting quality of the effluent to be
discharged into the sea, and transboundary impacts of pumping water from the Fan
Sediments. Ms. Filas also identified what she described as “Other Non-Conformities” in
her presentation at the Hearing on Quantum with regard to safety and security, traffic,
cumulative impacts and the presentation of alternatives for power supply, water supply

and concentrate transport in the ESIA.!3° In addition, Ms. Filas raised concerns with
regard to toxic mine water forming in the pit at closure of the mine and a requirement in

the 2002 BM Rules to fill up excavations after mining.'*?!

(a) Impacts of the Project on Air Quality

1051. With regard to air quality, Ms. Filas criticized in particular that, in her opinion, “the point
of compliance used for assessing air quality impacts were inappropriately located at both
the mine and the port.” Noting that the ESIA was to be submitted to the regulatory
authority, she considered that “[a]ir quality compliance is measured at the source” and
would therefore have expected a table in the ESIA providing information as to the
emissions at the mine itself. She also expressed the opinion that for dispersion modeling,
“the point of compliance is set at the property boundary or closes point of public access”
because “the project proponent does not control what happens outside the fence.”'** For
the mine area, Ms. Filas accepted that to set the points of compliance upgradient from the
wind in order to analyze the impacts to receiving communities “makes sense” but
maintained that these did not correspond to the closest point of public access, which she
instead considered to be the access road to the project. For the port area, Ms. Filas
similarly illustrated that the nearest residential location and a hotel were located closer to
the port site than the points of compliance. She acknowledged that “these two locations,
maybe these were built after the ESIA was completed’ but considered this as a
confirmation that “it’s more prudent to look at the property boundary because you can

always have receptors move in with time,

years, '32

1052. When presented with the dispersion plume for sulfur dioxide for the Marine Terminal
Operation Phase,'**4 Ms. Cessford testified that the areas within the dispersion plume
“would be experiencing an increase in ... annual average sulfur dioxide of two
micrograms per normal meter cubed.” She explained that in order to determine the
impact, the increase would have to be added to the background concentration and the total
figure would then be compared to the ambient air quality guideline for sulfur dioxide
annual average. Ms. Cessford stated that the concentration within the dispersion plume
was “well below” the guideline and also referred to “other ways of assessing the impact,
which are explained in more detail in the Air Quality Impact Assessment Report.”'**> As

for the dispersion plume for nitrogen dioxide presented for the same area,'**° Ms.
Cessford acknowledged that if inhaled, this gas “can have affects on your respiratory
system if it exceeds the ambient air quality limit.” She pointed out, however, that even the
areas nearest to the port with the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide had a
concentration of “Jess than the ambient air quality limit ... for nitrogen dioxide.” She
added that, therefore, “even in those areas, I would not expect to see an impact on health
based on comparison with the air ambient quality.”'*?7 With regard to the locations
circled in the illustration, Ms. Cessford testified that “[t]hey are chosen, one, because it's
the nearest location to the port, the port facility, so the nearest place a person could be
in terms of ambient air quality as opposed to occupational air quality. The one at the
Pearl Continental Hotel is basically downwind. And then, as we talked about, the upwind
one is a little bit trickier just because there is water there.”'*?8 Ms. Cessford further
explained:

“(If the authorities request it, it would be, I'm sure, not a problem to create

one maybe up on the mainland off the peninsula, to give a background,

because what you're trying--the objective is to generate a background

concentration. And if the authorities felt that that was not appropriate, it

would absolutely not be a problem to add another monitoring location in a

place that they felt was more appropriate.” °°

1053.Ms. Cessford further clarified that what Ms. Filas had described as inappropriate points

of compliance were not the points used to reach the conclusions regarding the impacts in
the ESIA. She explained that “[t]hose are the points that were used to represent to
stakeholders in a very simplistic way what the impacts might be on them. The conclusions
reached in the ESIA are based on the isopleth plumes and a specialist air quality
interpretation of those.”'>*°

1054. Based on the experts’ testimony, the Tribunal is not convinced by the concern raised by
Ms. Filas, i.e, that the impacts on air quality at the mine area and at the port area were
inappropriately assessed. In particular, Ms. Cessford pointed out that even the areas with
the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide close to the port site at Port Gwadar would
be within the relevant limits provided for ambient air quality. Ms. Filas stated in her
second report that she “could not evaluate whether ambient standards would be met at
the property boundary” because “the ESIA does not provide isocontours for SOx and NOx
concentration levels at the port’ but considered it “likely that ambient standards would
not be met” due to “the use of high sulfur fuel, multiple large generators, and the

relatively small size of the property.’'>! Ms. Filas therefore did not show that if the
impacts had been assessed at the property boundary, ambient standards would not have
been met; she merely presumed that this would be the case based on rather general
assumptions. She also did not engage with the information that the dispersion plumes also
provided on the areas closest to the port site, as Ms. Cessford pointed out at the Hearing
on Quantum.

1055.Consequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that if the points of compliance had been set
differently, the ambient standards for air quality would not have been met. In addition,
even if the authorities had requested that the impact be presented for a different location
such as the property boundary, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would have caused
significant additional costs or delay.

1056.Ms. Filas further continued to criticize that the ESIA did not present the emissions at
source. Already in her first report, Ms. Filas stated that “[t]he ESIA should have assessed
whether these occupational standards and guidelines could be met on site given the very
high SO2 and NO> emission levels.”'>*? In response, Ms. Cessford emphasized that “the
IFC PS do not require compliance with occupational health standards to be expressly
discussed in the ESIA. Instead, they mandate the identification and management of
occupational health exposures.” She further stated:

[T]he Filas Report has drawn conclusions based on a comparison of health
exposures against the EDC ambient limits which is not comparing the values
against the proper occupational standards. This misrepresents the
information provided in the ESIA report which is not appropriate for
occupational health assessment. The ESIA acknowledged the project’s
commitment to separately develop health and safety management plans, to
continuously and systematically identify, assess and respond to health and
safety risk throughout the project’s life cycle. The environmental and social
management programme included as part of the ESIA also reaffirmed this
commitment. In my experience, addressing occupational issues in this manner
would satisfy regulators or potential investors, or could be supplemented by
the mechanisms available to them if they were not.”'333

1057.In her second report, Ms. Filas responded to this statement:

“While Filas Engineering accepts that it is not necessary to develop
comprehensive health and safety plans prior to submittal of an ESIA, a
preliminary plan is usually included as part of the management system. Since
the ESIA did not include even a preliminary management system, as is
required for conformance with Pakistan, Equator Principles and IFC
Performance Standards, employee health impacts were never addressed.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -349-

The commitment referenced in the ESIA to develop a health and safety
management plan consists of approximately one page of general statements
that could apply to any project. There is no discussion of site-specific
concerns and potential safety measures that would be considered in
addressing these concerns. While it is customary to have a conceptual or
preliminary health and safety management plan completed at this stage in the
process, it is also common to provide more project-specific health and safety
information in the ESIA, especially if elevated levels of air pollutants are
expected, which they are, on site. This would establish some level of
confidence that the project proponent can meet applicable occupational
regulations and guidelines.”!

1058.The Tribunal notes that in addition to the disagreement regarding the preliminary
management system which has already been addressed above, Ms. Filas maintained her
opinion that “more project-specific health and safety information” should have been
provided in the ESIA. She did not, however, point to a specific requirement to this effect
in the IFC Performance Standards and therefore did not specifically address Ms.
Cessford’s comment that compliance with occupational health standards does not have to
be addressed in the ESIA. Ms. Filas also did not provide any support for her opinion that
a comparison of stack discharges with emission limits at the source “is normally required
by governments and lenders.” '>* In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Ms. Filas herself
stated in her second report:
“Although dispersion modeling is commonly used for evaluating compliance
with ambient standards and guidelines, the rules and guidelines for maximum
concentrations of pollutant apply to stack emissions. The air emission EDC
for power generation facilities states correctly that the Pakistan NEQS does

not have a stack emission standard for oil-fired power plants and instead
relies on an ambient standard.”'?*6

1059. Ms. Filas then referred to the Pakistan guidelines for major thermal power stations as well
as as the IFC guideline stack emission standards and, based on the annual level of NOx
emissions presented in the ESIA, considered it “likely that the exceedance of the guideline
is significant.”'?*” The Environmental Design Criteria and Guidance Report to which Ms.
Filas referred in this regard states:

“The HFO plant proposed is a reciprocating engine with a total rated heated
heat input capacity of 400 MW on a higher heating value basis and therefore
a number of the Pakistan standards are not applicable. In particular, the
particulate matter limits in the Pakistan guidelines for power plants and the
NEQS do not apply to engines and nitrogen oxides are controlled with

ambient standards only. The only Pakistan standard applicable to engines is
for sulfur dioxide. The IFC EHS Guidelines for Thermal Power Plants has
limits for reciprocating engines with total rated heat input capacity above
300 MW, which are based on one hour average basis and should be achieved
95% of annual operating hours. The relevant standards and derived project
design criteria are presented in Table 3.2.”!>*

1060. For nitrogen oxides, table 3.2 then refers to the IFC EHS Guidelines for Thermal Power
Plants and provides the following note: “The project is in an area of scarce water
resources (see note above) and therefore this Project emission limit only applies if the
Project’s ambient air quality criterion for nitrogen oxides (see Table 12.1) cannot

otherwise be achieved, as determined by air dispersion modeling.”'**°

1061.Ms. Filas agreed that there is no stack emission standard in the Pakistan NEQS which
instead rely on an ambient standard. She further did not provide the Tribunal with any
substantiated basis for calling into question the consideration presented in the ESIA that
the IFC emission guideline would become relevant only if the project could not otherwise
achieve compliance with the ambient air quality standard through dispersion modeling,
which has already been discussed in detail above.

1062.In the same context, Ms. Filas further criticized that the ESIA did not perform an analysis
regarding the amount of water required for NOx emission controls or the effectiveness of
water injection in reducing NOx emission levels. '*#° Ms. Cessford responded that in her
opinion this was not necessary because “[t]he dispersion modeling conducted as part of
the Air Quality Impact Assessment for the Reko Dig Mine Site concluded that the
predicted emissions from the power plant would enable compliance with the Project’s
ambient air quality target. Therefore, it did not provide emission controls for nitrogen
oxides. This is consistent with the EHS guidelines, which explicitly waive the requirement
to control nitrous oxides under these circumstances. The Filas Report also does not
challenge any aspect of the modeling process, including the underlying choice of model,
the ESIA’s approach to modeling or the scenarios adopted, or the inputs. Accordingly,
the Filas Report has provided no basis for its arguments.”'*"' In response, Ms. Filas noted
that the NOx emissions at the mine’s power plant did not comply with the IFC guidelines
at the source and maintained her opinion that the ESIA should “at least evaluate emission
controls and justify why water to reduce emission levels cannot be made available.” She
also criticized that nitrogen oxide controls were dismissed as unnecessary “without

presenting an assessment of the human health risk posed by worker exposure.” 3?

1063. As pointed out by Ms. Filas, the ESIA provides in this regard:

“The sulfur content of HFO currently available in Pakistan is 3.5%, which
prevents effective use of electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to control
particulates or selective catalytic reactors (SCR) to control oxides of nitrogen
(NOx). The maximum sulfur content that would allow use of ESP and SCR
under the expected operating conditions would be 2%.

Whereas particulates are effectively controlled by the included fabric filters,
no suitable alternative is available for NOx control. Water injection into the
engines would achieve some reduction in NOx emissions, but in a water-
scarce environment the achievable reduction in NOx emissions is outweighed
by the increased consumption of water. The mine site is in a non-deteriorated
airshed. Dispersion modelling (Chapter 7) demonstrates compliance with the
Project’s ambient air quality target for NOx. Therefore, no NOx emission
controls are provided. This is consistent with IFC guidelines, which waive the
requirement to control NOx emissions under these circumstances.”'*°

1064. Ms. Filas did not dispute the statement that NOx emission controls were not required by
the IFC guidelines in the circumstances presented in the ESIA. She also did not provide
an argument as to why a lender or regulatory authority would have considered NOx
emission controls necessary despite the absence of a NOx emission standard in the
Pakistan NEQS and the described waiver in the IFC guidelines. On balance, the Tribunal
is therefore not convinced that the assessments made by Claimant and its consultants with
regard to the impact on air quality were not in conformity with the relevant standards.

1065. Ms. Filas further testified that “[t]he ESIA also fails to address greenhouse gas emissions”
and that despite recognizing that “the mine site will be a major emitter,” it “present{ed]
no options to reduce or offset the impacts of greenhouse gas.” In her opinion, the
rationalization of these emissions by noting that they would amount to less than 1% of
Pakistan’s greenhouse emissions was “flawed” and “lenders would definitely take
exception to that logic.”'*** With regard to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Ms.
Cessford provided the following explanation in her expert report:

“Although not included in the GHG section, the ESIA report did include
information about the project’s consideration of a number of options with the
potential to reduce GHG for activities considered as significant emission
contributors: fuel, power and concentrate transportation. This was presented
in other sections of the ESIA report. For example, the ESIA indicated that the
HFO engines are convertible to dual fuel so that if natural gas became
available, modifications could be made to use natural gas. The ESIA also
evaluated different power supply options, including renewable energy
sources and acknowledged the use of wind as a supplemental energy source

as a matter for further investigation. The options considered, however, were
not technically and financially feasible and cost-effective. Also, the selection
of a concentrate slurry pipeline as the preferred option was based on a
number of reasons, including the fact that this resulted in lower GHG
emissions than transporting concentrate by trucks.”'3°

1066.In response, Ms. Filas merely noted the acknowledgment “that the GHG section of the
ESIA did not include the options considered for GHG mitigation” and maintained that
“the EDC obliged additional consideration in the feasibility study which was not done in
the SNC Lavalin report nor in the ESIA.”'*“° Ms. Filas did not, however, engage with the
references made by Ms. Cessford to the other sections of the ESIA in which certain
options were discussed but considered not feasible and cost-effective. Against this
background, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to discuss this criticism in further
detail as it has not been sufficiently substantiated.

(b) Impact of Discharging Effluent on Sea Water Quality

1067.Ms. Filas further criticized that the water treatment process and resulting quality of the
effluent to be discharged into the sea was calculated and that she “‘saw no evidence that
testing was done to demonstrate the quality of water that would be coming from this
system.” In her opinion, such testing would have been necessary to determine the efficacy
and to predict the cost for water treatment which are “usually not trivial” and “need to be
factored into the Feasibility Study.”'>” Ms. Filas then relied on a table in which she had
summarized the water quality data for the proposed Reko Dig project’s effluent discharge,
and highlighted in blue what she considered to be failures to comply with the relevant

standards. She further presented the ratio by which the concentration of the effluent
1348

exceeded the background concentration highlighted in yellow:

1068.In Ms. Filas’ opinion, “the yellow portion is compelling because what that is, is it takes
the treated effluent, and it divides each parameter by the background water quality.” She
acknowledged that “you can meet the ambient limits after dilution in this from the
modeling” but noted that the model “didn't take it over a 56-year time frame” and did not
look at the degradation of the water quality even though “70 percent of the people,
according to this ESIA, say that--they draw their income from the fishing industry out of
the Arabian Sea.” Ms. Filas considered that “even though the evaluation of the discharge
can meet the particular toxicity requirements of the ambient background conditions, when
you're putting out copper concentrations and zinc concentrations that are literally 10,000
times the concentration of the receiving seawater, that's a significant degradation of the
water, and that is something that--those are parameters that are known to be toxic to
aquatic life, and so it's something that I think would be very, very difficult to get past the
local community in Gwadar.” She emphasized that while the ESIA “only attempted to
look at the ... variances for boron,” “{t|he issue really is, the composition of the water is
extremely different than the composition of the receiving water, and that's what you see
highlighted in yellow, and that's where I think that the issue would see itself.”'*?

1069.The Tribunal notes that Ms. Cessford clarified in her report that the Upper Limits of
Treated Effluent, which are presented in the left column of the table prepared by Ms.
Filas, had to be compared to the EDC effluent limit presented in the Reko Diq Concentrate
Characterisation and Ocean Discharge Study prepared by Lorax Environmental in July
2010 (rather than the EDC Ambient Seawater Limits to which Ms. Filas had compared
them in her first report). Ms Cessford stated that “compar[ing] like for like ... the Filas
Report should have concluded that all the values are equal to or below the EDC effluent
limit.” Specifically, Ms. Cessford referred to the following table in the study prepared

by Lorax Environmental:!*>!

1070.Ms. Filas acknowledged in her second report that she had “initially misinterpreted the
information presented in the Lorax Report, as two different compliance criterion were
presented in the report with limited explanation.” However, she maintained her opinion
that “the proposed discharge of partially treated waste water exceeds Pakistan’s NEQS
for Municipal and Liquid Effluents into the Sea.”'>* Ms. Filas agreed with Ms. Cessford
that “the Pakistan NEQS only requires ‘end-of-pipe’ compliance for discharge to the sea”
but emphasized that “the proposed discharge does not meet the NEQS discharge standard
for total dissolved solids (TDS) and total toxic metals (TTM).” She further disagreed with
Ms. Cessford’s opinion that adequate justification was presented in the ESIA for relaxing
the standards for TDS and TTM and that this was in accordance with good international
practice. Ms. Filas considered that it would have been “normal practice to conduct bench-
scale tests of the treatment process to determine the level of treatment necessary to meet
water quality standards.” Ms. Filas also maintained that “some of these metals are present

in the effluent at thousands times greater than the ocean background levels” and that,

therefore, “it would be unlikely that the Pakistan EPA would relax the TTM standard in

such an important fishery.”'*>*

1071.Ms. Cessford explained at the Hearing on Quantum with regard to the ESIA’s proposal
for “a variance to the TTM (boron constituent only) and TDS limits”! that “the limit set
in the NEQS, which is the Pakistan limits, is significantly below the actual seawater level,
the actual concentration in the seawater. So, by--if the effluent was required to meet the
lower limit, you would be discharging--you would basically be putting in at much lower
than the existing seawater is.” Ms. Cessford further testified that “Canadian guidelines
indicate that the TDS discharge should not be more than 10 percent of the actual
receiving watercourse to protect aquatic life. So, if they were obligated to discharge TDS
at that concentration, it could actually be causing a harm to the aquatic life.”'?>> With
regard to boron, Ms. Cessford testified:

“In the case of boron, it's a less significant difference. So we're talking about-
-I think it was--the seawater was 6, and the limit needed to be less than 2 in
order to comply with the total toxic metals. But there was a conflict in the
guidelines, because the guidelines also give a limit of a boron of 6. But if you
discharge at 6, boron, you cannot comply with the total toxic metals of 2. So
there's a conflict in the legislation.

Obviously, I'm not party to how those guidelines were written, but my initial
reaction is regulators make mistakes. I was a regulator for eight years. We
make mistakes. And I suspect that these were carried over from the freshwater
limit into the marine and are mistakes. And, in my experience, regulators are
very reasonable when presented with this kind of information.”\>*°

1072.The Tribunal notes that Ms. Cessford’s explanation is in line with the argumentation
presented in the ESIA. It was specifically noted:

“Pakistan’s NEQS for effluent discharged to sea contains a limit for boron of
6 mg/L and a limit for total toxic metals (TTM) of 2 mg/L. The TTM parameter
incorporates boron along with 10 other metals, thus by implication lowering
the maximum possible value for boron to 2 mg/L. This lower boron value is
below the average background seawater concentration for boron of 6 mg/L,
as measured during the baseline studies. Additionally, the NEQS limit for
total dissolved solids (TDS) of 3,500 mg/L is also lower than the background
TDS of seawater in the discharge area (36,000 mg/L).

For the boron constituent in the TTM parameter and TDS, the Project
proposes to treat the concentrate filtrate to concentrations no higher than
seawater background levels, not to the lower levels implied in the NEQS.

Discharging effluent with lower values of these parameters than seawater
background would not benefit the marine ecosystem and would require more
elaborate treatment involving the generation of additional sludge requiring
disposal, with associated negative terrestrial environmental consequences.
Therefore the project is proposing a variance to the TTM (boron constituent
only) and TDS limits as there is no environmental benefit to be gained with
treatment to these discharge limitations.”'*°7

1073.In the Environmental Design Criteria and Guidance Report, it is similarly noted that “[flor
boron and TDS the Project proposes to treat the concentrate filtrate to seawater
background levels, not to the lower levels implied in the NEQS. Discharging effluent with
lower values of these parameters than seawater background would not benefit the marine
ecosystem and would require more elaborate treatment involving the generation of
additional sludge requiring disposal, with associated negative terrestrial environmental

consequences.” 8

1074.Ms. Filas maintained in her second report that the request to increase the TDS standard
to 36,000 mg/L was “without merit.” She did not dispute that this corresponded to the
background levels of TDS in the ocean but considered that it “ignor[ed] that the chemical
composition of the proposed effluent is quite different than sea water.” In her opinion,
“Tt]he effluent contains elevated levels of metal and would be expected to have a different
ionic makeup given the chemical characteristics of the pipeline concentrate.” She pointed
to the overall annual discharge of waste material into the sea and considered that “[g]iven
that the baseline report for the port area found that the sea water and sediment were of
good quality, it is unlikely that the Pakistan EPA and the local fisherman would agree to
this requested variance.”'*°° As for boron, Ms. Filas did not dispute the contradiction
between the the NEQS effluent standard for boron of 6 mg/L and the NEQS effluent
standard for total toxic metals of 2 mg/L. She maintained, however, that even excluding
boron, the TTM exceeded the effluent standard (2.12 compared to 2.0).!3°

1075. As for the variance of the TDF effluent standard, the Tribunal notes that Ms. Filas did not
provide any support for her opinion that the ESIA’s proposal to treat the concentrate to
seawater level would not be accepted due to the “quite different” chemical composition
of the effluent. The Tribunal understands based on Ms. Cessford’s reference to the
Canadian guidelines that it would in fact cause harm to aquatic life if the TDS discharge
varied more than 10% from the receiving watercourse, which would be the case if the
water were treated to the NEQS effluent standard. Against this background, the Tribunal

cannot follow Ms. Filas’ opinion that a variance would likely have been denied by the
Balochistan EPA.

1076.As for the total toxic metals, the Tribunal considers it common ground between the
experts that the NEQS effluent standard for boron, i.e., for one of the 11 metals included
in the TTM, was higher than the TTM effluent standard and that it was therefore
reasonable to request a variance for the boron constituent as proposed in the ESIA.
Finally, as for the TTM effluent (excluding boron), Ms. Filas calculated that the value
still exceeded the NEQS standard. However, in the absence of any further support for Ms.
Filas’ argument that the ESIA incorrectly calculated the TTM effluent, the Tribunal has
no basis to assume that the ESIA contained an error which would have been a significant
issue for the Balochistan EPA.

1077. The Tribunal notes that in her table presented at the Hearing on Quantum, Ms. Filas also
highlighted certain additional values, which in her opinion failed to comply with the
NEQS and IFC limits, specifically for copper, iron, lead and nickel. Ms. Cessford
testified, however, that the IFC Liquid Effluent Limits to which Ms. Filas had compared
the Upper Limits of Treated Effluent were “very outdated” as they “date way back to the
previous set of guidelines which were superseded” and stated that they had instead used
the numbers in the Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines dated 2007.'°°! The
Tribunal notes that the document referenced by Ms. Filas for this column indeed dates
from July 1998.'%° Ms. Cessford’s testimony is therefore plausible to the Tribunal. Also
taking into account that the values for copper, iron, lead and nickel are all equal to or
below the values presented in the Reko Diq Concentration Characterisation and Ocean

1363

Discharge Study, the Tribunal cannot follow Ms. Filas’ opinion that the planned

discharges exceeded the relevant effluent limits.

1078. Finally, the Tribunal recalls that what Ms. Filas described as “the real issue” concerned
her illustration in yellow of the Effluent-to-Background Ratio, i.e., the ratio between the
concentration of a certain element in the effluent that Claimant planned to discharge into
the sea and the background concentration in the ocean water. Ms. Cessford acknowledged
that “there are some quite significant increases, yes.”'*°* When asked whether she would
anticipate that this would have an effect on how fishermen would view the impact of the
project, she testified:

“The way you have to look at this is that the discharge obviously looks at
emission limits at the point of release, which we talked about the motivation

for adjustment of those. It then looks at the compliance with ambient seawater
quality guidelines, and that's where all the modeling comes in.

Now, that modeling shows that those ambient water quality limits can be met
within different distances, depending on the scenarios used. So, there is a
range of scenarios used to look at sort of your normal case and then a worst
case.

So, what's important here is compliance with the ambient seawater quality
limits because those are set specifically to protect marine life, not the
difference between baseline and the ambient limit.

So, just because you have a background that's much lower than the ambient
limit doesn't mean that there's going to be an impact, because the ambient
limit is set to protect marine life.

And then in addition to that, the ESIA, the marine specialists, undertook
ecotoxicology. So, they specifically looked at the effect on, I think, three
organisms to evaluate the ecotoxicology of the effluent.

And then that--also you see how far--what sort of distance--we call it a mixing
zone--what sort of distance from the discharge point that reaches. That
showed an even smaller mixing zone than compliance with the ambient limits,
which just shows that the ambient limits are conservative in nature in terms
of protecting marine life.

And under normal circumstances, we were looking at--I can't remember the
numbers--but I think 1 meter and 3 meter for ecotoxicology and ambient
chemistry. And then I think it was 10 and 13 for the worst case scenario.

So, we're talking about an impact that stretches 13 meters from a discharge

1079. As for the impact that the ratio presented by Ms. Filas would have on the perception by

the local community regarding the discharge, Ms. Cessford considered that “it depends
on how it was presented. If an anti-mining NGO got ahold of it and presented it in a
similar way to what we're talking about now, yes, it could give negative. But if it was
presented with the scientific information on the ecotoxicology and the ambient air,
seawater quality monitoring and the actual expected impact and the proposed

monitoring, and it was presented in a constructive way, you'd get a different reaction.”

1080.The Tribunal finds Ms. Cessford’s testimony convincing. While particularly the ratios

1365
1366

presented by Ms. Filas for copper (10,000), iron (4,000), lead (7,800), zinc (10,050) and

ammonia (8,375) have been acknowledged by Ms. Cessford as “quite significant,” it
appears to be undisputed that this ratio is not directly relevant to assessing whether the
discharge was in compliance with the relevant effluent standards and the ambient

seaweater limits which Claimant had also set out in its EDC. As discussed above, the

Tribunal is not convinced that the discharge failed to comply with any of the relevant
limits. Rather, both Respondent’s line of questioning and Ms. Filas’ testimony indicate
that the Effluent-to-Background ratio could have influenced the perception of the
discharge by the community and in particular the fishermen. In this regard, the Tribunal
also agrees with Ms. Cessford that this perception would naturally depend on the way in
which the information was presented to the community. While it may be reasonable to
assume that there would be opposition from the fishermen to the discharge because they
feared an impact on their income, the Tribunal sees no basis to assume that a regulatory
authority acting in good faith would have refused to grant a permit for the discharge in
compliance with the applicable standards. This does not mean that the perception of the
project by the community was irrelevant but, in the Tribunal’s view, a perceived impact
is better characterized as a social impact and should be discussed in the context of whether
Claimant had adequate plans to ensure that it would obtain and maintain a social license
to operate. This will be addressed further below.

(c) Disposal of Sludge Generated by Water Treatment

1081. An additional concern raised by Ms. Filas with regard to the water treatment process was
the disposal of the sludge generated by the treatment of the water before discharging it
into the sea. In the context of whether the costs of the ESIA were factored into the
Feasibility Study, she noted that “[i]f you have to transport sludge back to the mine, that
could be quite a costly activity, and they hadn’t even decided what they were going to do
with that.”!367 Ms, Filas was referring to the earlier testimony of Ms. Cessford in response
to the question whether she agreed that the ESIA did not arrive at a conclusion regarding
the disposal of the wastewater treatment sludge:

“At the time we were finalizing the ESIA, I think that work was still
progressing for the project, and in line with the precautionary principle,
which is one of the fundamental principles of Environmental and Social
Impact Assessment, we evaluated--I'm going to use the word ‘worst case,’ so
anything that the company did that improved the situation would be better.
So we've evaluated the most--the worst potential in terms of impacts, and the
information is what's presented in the impact assessment.”

1082. She clarified that “[a] number of options were presented” in the ESIA for where to dispose
of the wastewater treatment sludge and testified that “J believe one was at the mine site,
and the other would be at a site that would have to be authorized by the authorities.” She
added that “there's not a specific ‘this is what it's going to be.’ Jt presented some

alternatives and it indicated that we would assess the worst of those situations.”

1083. The issue was not addressed in the first round of the experts’ reports. In her second report,
Ms. Filas expressed the opinion that the “assessment of impacts associated with
wastewater treatment and the sludge that will be generated at the Port of Gwadar was
substantially disregarded.”'*”” She noted that the ESIA provided the following
information:

“Excess overflow water from the dewatering process is treated before being
discharged to the sea. Treatment will consist of lime pre-treatment followed
by reverse osmosis. The effluent treatment process will generate a sludge,
which will be disposed of in a lined facility at the mine site or other suitable
authorized location.”'3"

1084. Ms. Filas further noted that site layout drawings of the ESTA showed two water treatment
plant sludge ponds but considered that “they appear to be for temporary storage given
that they are much too small to store an appreciable amount of the sludge that would be
produced by this large of [sic] a dewatering operation.” She therefore complained that
“Tt]here was no discussion of permanent repositories for water treatment sludge in the
Conceptual Closure Plan at either the mine or port facility” and that, apparently, no tests
were carried out “to determine the amount of sludge that would be produced and what its
chemical characteristics might be.” In her opinion, “[t]he lack of this information and the
lack of a disposal facility design and associated costing represents a large gap in the
ESIA and associated documents.”'*”? Ms. Filas further stated that in order to grant a
discharge permit, the regulatory authority would need to review “the solid waste
characteristics of the sludge produced during the treatment process and the proposed
disposal facility,’ and considered that the above quoted description in the ESIA fell “far
short of what would be required for a regulatory agency to evaluate the toxicity of the
material and the type of lined facility that would be needed to safely dispose of the

material.”'37

1085. At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Livesey was referred to the description in the ESIA and
responded to the question whether he knew where Claimant decided to actually put the
sludge, that “at the port, there was a design containment facility to collect that--in the
port design. It's not on this image. This just shows the ship loader. But if you show the
picture of the wider port design, you can see, quite clearly marked, there's a sludge
containment pond next to the dewatering area.”'*"* When asked whether Claimant also
contemplated disposing sludge at the mine site, Mr. Livesey responded that they

“contemplated tailings at the mine site” but that “this reference here, if this is referring
to the operations at the port, clearly it wouldn't be driven back up to the mine site. This
would be in an authorized facility in the Port Gwadar area.” He confimed that he was
not aware where that facility would have been “because Port Gwadar was and is still
undergoing expansion. The 30-year design is available and, I believe, was reviewed by
Tethyan's team, as we did with Port Qasim and Port Karachi as well.”'3”° Mr. Livesey
further testified:

“But there was a facility designed, I think, on the--to the east in the bay--in
the bay to the east of the promontory--if there was a map, I could point it out-
-was the area which the Government itself had designated as part of the port
expansion as a materials-handling area. I can't remember the exact phrase
they used, but it basically referred to bulk materials.

And that would have been an area that probably would have had this type of
facility developing in it.

Q. You stated that ‘would have been an area that probably would have had
this type of facility.’ So, you don't know. You're speculating as to what it
would be; right?

A. I'm speculating based on the interactions we had at Port Qasim and Port
Karachi, where the port designs contemplated disposal of materials--areas
for disposal of materials. And the fact that the team met with Port Gwadar
officials and again looked at the Project design for Port Gwadar.”'*"°

included in the Feasibility Study, Mr. Livesey stated:

“T'm sure there would be a cost captured in there somewhere. I don't know
where it is.

Q. Would it surprise you if it was not?

A. It would surprise me if it was not if it was a significant cost. We don't know
how much sludge would be generated. We don't know whether it would be a
significant cost. The likelihood is it wouldn't.

The sludge at the dewatering facility is a wash-down material. The material
that is coming down the pipe is concentrate, which you want to dry and ship,
and the resultant waters that you are bringing out would be put down and
disposed of separately.

So, the sludge would be a minor component by the time you're at the port
facility.

Q. So, you don't know how much sludge would have been generated, but you
are able to reach a conclusion as to whether the cost would have been
significant?

A. No. I can say that if the cost had been significant, I would be surprised if
it had been omitted, which, I think, was the thrust of your question. I did not
say that the cost would be significant. I said I suspected that it would not
because the volumes would be small, in my opinion. But it was not my area

to design. I was the Project Director. I was not specifically on any one target

area,?!377

1087.In the Tribunal’s view, Mr. Livesey’s testimony that a sludge disposal facility was
designed and contemplated to be in an area designated by the Government for bulk
material appears plausible. The Tribunal also finds it reasonable that it was not yet clear
where exactly that facility would be due to the fact that Port Gwadar was in the process
of being expanded. Given Mr. Livesey’s explanation that their assumption for the
contemplated location was based on interactions of his team with officials at Port Gwadar
and the port design for contemplated disposal of materials, the Tribunal cannot agree with

Respondent’s characterization that Mr. Livesey was “mere speculating.” '>78

1088. The remaining question is therefore whether the costs associated with the sludge disposal
facility were included in the Feasibility Study. As pointed out by Respondent, Mr.
Livesey did not confirm that this was the case nor did he confirm that they were not a
significant cost. He explained, however, why it was likely that it was not a significant
cost and reiterated that “any sludge generated ... would most likely be from wash-downs
and flushing out of equipment, which would, you know, not be—we’re not talking about
half of the contents of the concentrate pipeline going into a sludge tank.”'>”° The Tribunal
also notes that, while Ms. Filas referred to the sludge disposal as a potentially “costly
item,” she clarified that this “could” be the case “[i]f you have to transport sludge back
to the mine.”'**° Tt is therefore apparent that she was transferring to the cost of
transporting the sludge rather than the cost of disposing it in a designated facility. Mr.
Livesey clarified, however, that the sludge generated at the port would not be transported
back to the mine site but rather disposed in the Port Gwadar area and that, therefore, no
such costly transport would occur. Ms. Filas did not provide any opinion whether the cost
associated with disposing the sludge would be significant and the Tribunal therefore has
no basis to doubt Mr. Livesey’s explanation as to why they would likely not be significant.

1089.In addition, the Tribunal recalls that the ESIA explicitly noted that by requesting a
variance for two metals contained in the effluent to be discharged into the sea, additional
water treatment and the creation of additional sludge were avoided. In the Tribunal’s
view, this further confirms the reasonableness of Claimants plan to request a variance and
Mr. Livesey’s testimony that the volume of sludge generated would not be such as to

cause significant additional cost. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to make a
conclusive finding as to whether the costs for the disposal facility were included in the
cost estimate of the Feasibility Study because, in any event, it is not convinced that this
would amount to a significant additional cost.

(d) Further “Non-Conformities” Regarding Environmental Impacts

1090. As a final criticism on water, Ms. Filas also criticized that the ESIA characterized the
drawdown of the aquifer at the Fan Sediments and transboundary effects to be of “low

significance.” The water supply, including the transboundary effects into Afghanistan,
have already been addressed in detail above. At this point, it suffices to add to the
Tribunal’s previous findings that the Tribunal is not convinced by Ms. Filas’ comment
that “[e]ven though there were no beneficial users of the water identified, water
competition will be significant if you’ve got water available.”'**' As discussed in detail
above, Claimant pointed out that the water at the Fan Sediments was not potable and not
suitable for irrigation and agricultural use. Also taking into account Ms. Filas’ agreement
that “there is no fixed procedure for assessing the significance of impacts,”'*** the
Tribunal is therefore not convinced that it was inadequate in the circumstances to assign
a low significance to this aspect.

1091. With regard to Ms. Filas’ criticism on the absence of “an appropriate security and conflict
action plan,” the Tribunal refers to its detailed analysis of the security-related issues
above and further recalls that these were addressed in the Feasibility Study, in particular
Chapter 19 on Security, which Ms. Filas also reviewed and considered to be “more like
what [she] was expecting to see.”'*** In the absence of any detailed engagement by Ms.
Filas with those parts of the Feasibility Study that addressed security and conflict in the
area, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address Ms. Filas’ criticism on the
absence of appropriate information in the ESIA in more detail.

1092. An additional criticism of Ms. Filas concerned the characterization of traffic impacts as
“negligible” despite the lack of information on road size, conditions and current levels of
congestion. Ms. Cessford pointed out that “the lack of information on road geometry and
future improvement plans is a result of HBP’s inability to obtain this from the National
Highway Authority of Pakistan.” She added that “[t]he study used available information
and presented results showing the incremental increase was not considered significant in
light of the overall increase in traffic expected as a result of Pakistan’s ongoing
development. In any event, the condition of the national roads is something over which

TCCP has no control, which the ESIA acknowledged. To the extent that TCCP will
construct or maintain roads outside the Project area, the ESIA also committed to perform
regular inspections.” Ms. Cessford also noted that as the condition of the roads was a
matter outside the control of the company, she failed to see how this could affect an

investor’s decision whether to participate in the project.!**4

1093. As pointed out by Ms. Cessford, the Traffic Modeling for Reko Diq Transport Corridors

prepared by Hagler Bailly Pakistan in July 2010 noted in its section of Total future Traffic
Levels:

“Tt is pertinent to know the present highway capacity and the extent to which
it is currently utilized and will be utilized in future, ie, when it is likely to
saturate. This information is not available from the National Highway
Authority. As highway capacity is a function of road surface dimension,
geometry, controls, and environmental conditions, any attempt to calculate
the highway capacity also failed due to lack of information on these aspects.
Only relevant information that is available is that the highway is a two lane
highway (one lane in each direction). The width of each lane is 3.7 m (12 feet)
and the shoulders on each side are between I to 2 m (typically 6 feet). The
exceptions are as follows: [...)”85

1094. Similarly, it is noted in the section of Future Road Development Plans:

“Future road development plans for the segments comprising RD-1 were not
available with the NHA. However, these are expected to include roadway
widening, resurfacing, shoulder and curvature improvements, additional
lanes and carriageways, bridges and grade-separated intersections, and new
alignments and connecting routes that will improve the route capacity, level
of service, and reduce travel distances. These changes may appreciably alter
the regional roadway infrastructure over the operational phase of the
Project.” 1°86

1095.In response, Ms. Filas emphasized that she had merely observed that if the capacity and

physical condition of the roadways is unknown, “the ramifications of that increase cannot
be assessed based on the available information.” She added that “[t]his observation was
in response to the ESIA having turned the HBP report into seven pages of impact

 

assessment text when the HBP report did not present anything more than traffic counts.
To assess impacts, an understanding of the road conditions and carrying capacities must
be coupled with the baseline traffic and Project-related traffic volumes to determine if
the Project-related transportation requirements can be accommodated or will adversely
affect existing public arterials.” Ms. Filas then clarified that she did not state that this
issue would affect an investor’s decision but “simply observed that impacts could not be

reasonably drawn from calculated percentages of traffic counts. Impacts could only be
understood when those increases in traffic counts are coupled with the capacity and
condition of the arterial.”'357

1096. In light of Ms. Filas’ clarification that she did not consider this issue to affect an investor’s
decision and also taking into account that any more detailed assessment of the traffic
impact would have required information that was not available from the National
Highway Authority of Pakistan, the Tribunal is not convinced that this aspect would have
been considered a significant issue by lenders or the authorities.

1097. Finally, Ms. Filas considered that the assessment of certain additional cumulative impacts
like the Tanjeel project, air emissions and water discharge as well as alternatives for
power supply, water supply and concentrate transport were not sufficiently addressed in
the ESIA. In this regard, Ms. Cessford explained that the Tanjeel project was not
addressed in the ESIA because its scope was limited to the initial mine plan, which did
not include Tanjeel. She also noted that “[a]/though not explicitly stated in the ESIA the
Tanjeel project was considered within the cumulative impact assessment as part of
TCCP’s planned expansion. The ESIA report also acknowledged the upsides associated
with the socio-economic effects of expansion by TCCP or the development of other
projects in Section 9.3.”'*8 In response, Ms. Filas maintained her opinion that having a
previously approved ESIA for Tanjeel and then not mentioning it in the cumulative
impact section of the ESIA for the Feasibility Study was “highly unusual” and considered
that it was relevant in that “it could potentially prolong the life of the Project and disturb
more land, with all the trickle-down impacts, both positive and negative, that go with land
disturbance and extended mine life.”'>*

1098.In the Tribunal’s view, it is plausible that the Tanjeel project and the additional impacts
it might have would have to be addressed if and when they materialized, i.e., in the context
of the contemplated expansion. By contrast, the Tribunal is not convinced that the
Balochistan EPA or a lender would have expected these impacts to be addressed in the
context of the ESIA for the Initial Mine Development Feasibility Study covering the
Wester Porphyries and not the Tanjeel area. As for the additional aspects of the air
emissions and water discharge, the Tribunal notes that these were raised by Ms. Filas only
in her second report and not substantiated in any further detail.

1099. Finally, as for the alleged failure to sufficiently consider alternatives for power supply,
water supply and concentrate transport, Ms. Cessford stated noted that “there is no
requirement to exhaustively consider and investigate all alternatives at the same level of

detail. For example, Pakistan’s Guidelines for the preparation and review of
Environmental Reports expressly recognise this. It also states that it is ‘quite common to
undertake a preliminary analysis of a wide set of alternatives to decide which ones should
be taken forward for further consideration, and which ones should be discarded.’ The
Guidelines also accept that in many environmental impact assessments, the ‘favoured
alternative will be the only one examined in detail.’””!*°? As for the IFC Performance
Standards, Ms. Cessford explained that they require “an environmental and social impact
assessment to include ‘an examination of technically and financially feasible alternatives
to the source of such impacts, and documentation of the rationale for selecting the
particular course of action proposed.’ The Guidance Notes to the IFC PS explain that the
report ‘typically includes’ analysis of alternatives that ‘[c]ompares reasonable
alternatives’ and ‘[s]tates the basis for selecting the particular project design proposed.”
It also implicitly recognises that the ESIA need not be exhaustive but should ‘focus[ ] on
the significant issues’ and its scope and level of detail should be ‘commensurate’ with the
project’s impacts and risks.’ Accordingly, in preparing the ESIA report there is judgment
involved in determining ‘reasonable’ alternatives and the level of detail necessary to meet
the IFC PS requirements to compare alternatives and state the basis for selecting an

alternative.”'!

1100.Ms. Cessford testified that as noted in the ESIA, alternatives were “investigated and
refined” but in some cases, the results of investigations were included in the supporting
documents rather than the main ESIA report because they were no longer relevant to the
final project description. She also stated that she attended workshops and conference calls
discussing alternatives, which meant that “the analysis of alternatives proceeded both
formally and informally and was reflected in the ESIA and other documentation.” Ms.
Cessford then discussed in more detail the evaluation of the different water sources, the
HFO plant to which there were “no other technically and financially available
alternatives that could have been considered” and concentrate transport for which three

options were considered.'*9*

1101.In response, Ms. Filas noted that “[t]echnical reviewers are not mind readers” and
considered that “if the ESIA fails to enumerate the alternatives considered or how the
criteria influenced their decisions, a reviewer has no choice but to identify that missing

information and explanation as gaps.”!3°

1102.The Tribunal is not convinced by Ms. Filas’ argument. While it is certainly true that
technical reviewers could only rely on information provided to them, Ms. Cessford stated
that the information was included in the supporting documentation, which would also be
provided to a reviewer. This is also expressly noted in the ESIA.'** In addition, Ms. Filas
did not engage with Ms. Cessford’s references to both Pakistan’s guidelines and IFC
Performance Standards and her explanation as to why she therefore considered the
discussion of alternatives in the ESIA and/or supporting documentation adequate and
sufficient. Against this background and in the absence of any further substantiation on
this point, the Tribunal is not convinced that a lender or regulatory authority would have
requested additional work on the consideration of alternatives for power supply, water
supply or concentrate transport.

(e) Impact of the Project After Closure of the Mine

1103.As a final matter that was not addressed in any detail at the Hearing on Quantum, the
Tribunal notes that Ms. Filas also criticized in her first report that while the ESIA and the
Conceptual Closure Plan did not expect that a toxic pit lake would form at closure of the
mine, they failed to evaluate the likeliness and she “did not identify documentation to
substantiate the presence or absence of a pit lake at closure.” Ms. Filas considered:
“The ESIA has already stated that the hypersaline sink water contained in the
pit would be a high to extremely high toxicity risk. Moreover, surface water
exposure in such a hyper-arid environment could potentially result in
significant impacts to living receptors. Road blocks, berms and physical
enclosures all have the potential of being breached if humans, animals, birds
or other organisms have no other access to water. The ESIA disregards the
potentially significant impacts associated with a likely toxic water body
remaining at the surface post-closure, even if only temporary as a result of
precipitation events.” !7°°
1104.In response, Ms. Cessford emphasized that “[t]he ESIA acknowledges there is a threat to
birds of exposure to the pit lake based on a screening level risk assessment undertaken in
supporting documents. Having identified the potential risk, it is not correct for the Filas
Report to say that the ESIA did not assess the risk.”'*°" Specifically, the ESIA states:
“The model indicates that should a pit lake form, the combination of the
metals in the pit lake water with the excessive concentrations of calcium,
chloride, magnesium, potassium, sodium and sulfate, makes the modelled pit

waters unsuitable for consumption, with an overall high to extremely high
risk to livestock and wildlife.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -368-

During operation, water will be removed from the pit and used in the process
plant. Access of livestock and large mammals to the pit will be prevented by
a fence. At closure, earth embankments will be placed across access points to
the pit and the haul roads will be ripped up, and fences will be placed around
the pit to preclude access by large mammals and livestock. It is expected that
over time, the pit bottom will slowly fill with windblown sand further reducing
the size and duration of any pit lake.”'>°*

1105. With regard to the likelihood of a pit lake forming after the closure of the mine, Ms.
Cessford noted that “technical experts from SMEC and Barrick provided findings with
respect to the groundwater inflow, on which the Filas Report has not commented.”°°? In
this regard, Ms. Cessford referred to the Section on Temporary Pit Lake Geochemical
Predictive Modelling in the report on Geochemical Characterisation and Prediction, Reko
Dig Project, Pakistan prepared by SRK Consulting in July 2010, which states, inter alia:

“Pit water balance studies undertaken by Barrick (Zhan and Shelp, 2008a;
Zhan, 2008; Zhan and Shelp, 2008b) have shown that a permanent pit water
body will not form at the Reko Dig site. This is due to low precipitation,
minimal groundwater interception and highly evaporative environment.
However, modelling indicates that temporary pit water bodies may form in
response to extreme storm events (Zhan, 2009; Appendix J, Attachment SC).
SRK has modelled these events taking into account post closure build up of
evaporative deposits within the pit bottom and wall rocks in response to
average rainfall events.”'4°

1106.Ms. Cessford further pointed out that both the ESIA and the Conceptual Closure Plan
“also acknowledged that further studies are needed during the life of the project to
confirm: a) if a lake is likely to form; and b) how potential exposure of wildlife,
particularly birds, could be managed.”'“°' Among the primary components of the closure
approach, the ESIA lists the following:

“Pit safety berms and/or fences will be placed around the perimeter of the pit
and across the ramps into the pits to restrict vehicular access. Groundwater
intersected by the pit is notexpected to accumulate in the pit to form a lake
after closure. However, storm water may periodically accumulate in the pit
bottom and remain until it evaporates. Additional monitoring and studies
during operations will be able to better predict if groundwater is likely to
inflow into the pit at a rate that would cause a permanent pit lake in which
case additional mitigation could be required.”'*°

1107. The Conceptual Closure Plan further stated:

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -369-

“One large open pit will exist at closure, the Western Porphyries pit. Based
on the current groundwater models, the pit is not expected to collect
groundwater after closure, although monitoring of groundwater inflows
during operations will provide additional data to improve the accuracy of this
prediction. However, stormwater may accumulate ephemerally during major
storm events and that water is likely to exceed IFC water quality standards.
Given the significant evaporation at the site, any collected stormwater is not
expected to remain in the pit for very long.
Because there is some uncertainty associated with the prediction of
groundwater inflow to the pit, and the likelihood of ephemeral stormwater
collection, mitigation measures to protect human, terrestrial and avian life
may be required after closure. Therefore, the closure plan assumes that
access to the pit will be limited after closure by construction of fences and
berms around the pit. Avian access to a possible pit lake would be difficult to
limit, so future studies should evaluate the need for, and feasible types of
mitigation for this potential risk.
Although placement of waste rock backfill in the pit bottom, or an excavated
sump in the pit bottom, could act as a temporary mitigation measure, it is not
considered a permanent solution because fine grained material from the pit
walls and blowing sand will eventually fill the void spaces in the backfill,
limiting the water that could be stored in the backfill and resulting in an
ephemeral pit lake on top of the backfill following major storm events. The
other closure concern related to the pit is the safety risk associated with the
final pit highwalls. Currently, the key components of the closure approach for
the open pits include:
* placement (or repairing) of a safety berm and/or fence a safe distance
from the pit high wall;
* posting warning signs around the pit highwall; and
* construction of berms across the pit ramps to stop unauthorized access
to the pit.
Over time, blowing sand is likely to accumulate in the pits. This would not

adversely affect the closure design and would be consistent with natural
landforms in the area.”"4°?

1108. Ms. Cessford then expressed the opinion that “[g]iven the risk concerns a situation arising
after many years at the closure of the mine, even if this was perceived as a shortcoming,
a regulator could require remedial action such as monitoring or further investigation
during the operation of the mine. A potential investor could also require an ESAP to

monitor, review and audit the company’s compliance with its plan for further studies.”'*"*

 

1109.In her second report, Ms. Filas did not reiterate her initial criticism that the ESIA failed
to evaluate the likelihood of a pit lake forming at closure or that it disregarded the

potentially significant impacts associated with a (temporary) pit lake. However, she raised
a new concern, i.e., that the EDC and Conceptual Closure Plan failed to discuss “the
Balochistan requirement for backfillung excavations upon closure” or the potential need
to request a variance.'#°> She took note of the following statement in Table 3.1 on
Environmental Legislation Relevant to Reko Dig in Appendix C of the ESIA:

“The requirement of Rule 13(2)(d) to fill up all excavations is interpreted not

to apply to large scale open pit mining operations, as complete backfilling of

the open pit would be infeasible and would not be required for similar

operations anywhere else.” 4°

1110. The requirement itself was described to be as follows:

“The conditions pertaining to the mitigation of negative impacts require that
the holder of the mineral title or concession:

* on the expiry, termination, surrender or cancellation of the title or
concession and in accordance with good mining practices, fills up all
excavations, securely plugs all mines, removes all equipment,
installations and structures and restores the land, in so far as possible,
to its original condition and to prevent hazards to human or animal life
or to the property of others or to the environment [Rule 13(2)(d)].”!4°"

1111.In Ms. Filas’ opinion, the interpretation regarding the inapplicability of the requirement

to the Reko Diq project was wrong because “[t]here are many instances where pit
backfilling is done concurrent with mining operations and there are instances where such
backfilling is required by law. Exemptions to complete pit backfilling are sometimes
approved by regulating authorities, but such variances are authorized based on
appropriate technical and financial justification presented by the project proponent, not
based on an arbitrary assumption that Balochistan law is not applicable to this
Project.”'*°8 In support of her opinion, Ms. Filas referenced US and California

legislation. 4°

1112.Ms. Filas further agreed that “there is significant time to optimize the Conceptual Closure

Plan included as Appendix D to the ESIA over the life of the Project” but considered that
“the ESIA commitments must be sufficient to demonstrate that the proposed action
presented in the ESIA has the ability to mitigate Project risks to acceptable levels. It is
not enough to simply intimate that there is a risk and we will deal with it later because
we don’t need to know if our closure plan will work for at least 50+ years. The ESIA must

present a plan that will mitigate unacceptable risks. That plan is then carried forward
into the Project feasibility study and financial analysis.” Specifically with regard to the
requirement to fill up all excavations, Ms. Filas considered that the acknowledgment of
this requirement only in an appendix and its dismissal as inapplicable suggested that it
“may have been intentionally ignored.” She added that “[i]f the Government of
Balochistan were to insist on compliance with this backfilling requirement, the circa $130
million closure cost estimate presented in the Feasibility Study and presumably included
in the Project financial model would be grossly inadequate and may affect the overall
feasibility of the Project.”\4"°

1113. The Tribunal notes that the issue was not discussed with the experts during the Hearing
on Quantum. However, given that Ms. Filas had raised this issue only in her second report,
Claimant sought leave to introduce certain exhibits into the record which demonstrate in
its view that “complete backfilling is not generally required for pits of the kind
contemplated for Reko Dig” as well as that “the specific California requirement cited by
Ms. Filas has long been controversial and that substantial revisions to limit its scope
were under active consideration.”'“!! The Tribunal admitted these exhibits de bene esse
and now decides to admit them into the record. As pointed out by Claimant, Ms. Filas did
not include the requirement of filling up excavations in her presentation of the “non-
conformities” she had identified in the ESIA. She did, however, maintain that “[t]oxic
mine water was a concern during public consultation, so leaving toxic water in the pit at
closure will likely be contentious.”'*'? In her conclusion, Ms. Filas included “the toxic
mine water that would be left at the end of the closure period” as an issue for which

“[t]hey haven’t provided justifications.”\4"°

1114. Against this background, it appears to the Tribunal that while Ms. Filas maintained her
criticism that the concern of leaving toxic mine water in the pit at closure was not
adequately addressed in the ESIA, she did not reiterate her criticism that this was contrary
to a requirement in the 2002 BM Rules or contrary to current practices in mining
operations. The Tribunal therefore does not consider it necessary to address the evidence
submitted by Claimant in detail. It suffices to note at this point that the California
Regulation on backfilling was criticized in the documents submitted by Claimant as being
detrimental to the environment because it “requires moving material twice (increasing
GHG emissions), fails to address the proper storage and handling of waste materials

(jeopardizing water quality), and can cause greater ground disturbances (impacting
habitat for sensitive species).”\*\4

1115.The Tribunal notes that considerations underlying a discussion on amendments to
California legislation are not directly relevant to whether the Balochistan authorities
would request that Claimant fill up the excavations created by its mining project at
closure. As pointed out by Ms. Filas, rules 13/2)(d)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules indeed
provides that “[i]t shall be a condition of every mineral title or mineral concession that -
... (d) on the expiry, termination, surrender or cancellation of the title or concession, the
holder thereof, in accordance with good mining practices, shall - (i) fill up all excavations
on the land to which the title or concession relates.”'*'> This provision is contained in
Part III of the 2002 BM Rules, which contains general provisions on Mineral Titles and
Mineral Concessions and would thus generally be applicable to the project. However, the
Tribunal cannot agree with Ms. Filas that the ESIA ignored this requirement and
dismissed it without any discussion with the GOB. In the appendix to the ESIA, it is stated
that “complete backfilling of the open pit would be unfeasible and would not be required
for similar operations anywhere else.”'*'® While Ms. Filas disputed this statement, she
did not provide any support for her opinion apart from her reference to US and California
legislation which is apparently under revision due to the environmental concerns raised
by the backfilling requirement. In addition, as Mr. Filas herself noted, the Chapter on
Closure in the Feasibility Study expressly quotes, inter alia, the requirement in rule
13(2)(d)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules and then states:
“These rules contain some requirements that appear to imply that all pits
would require backfilling as part of closure. However, these regulations are
based on laws written in the mid-twentieth century and complete backfilling
of large base metal pits is not a standard practice anywhere in the world.
These particular aspects of the regulation will need to be discussed and

clarified with the Balochistan government during negotiations for the mining
lease.”\4"7

1116.Consequently, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent or Ms. Filas that this
requirement was simply ignored or hidden in an appendix to the ESIA. Claimant rather
made express reference to it in the Feasibility Study and considered it an aspect for
negotiation with the GOB. Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal sees no basis
for doubting Claimant’s statement that complete backfilling is not standard practice in the
mining industry. Also taking into account the express reference in rule 13(2)(d)(i) of the
2002 BM Rules to “good mining practices” and the environmental implications of

backfilling which were not addressed by Ms. Filas, the Tribunal is not convinced that the
GOB would have required Claimant to completely fill up the excavation created by the
mine and, thus, that it should have accounted for the cost of complete backfilling in its
estimate of the closure costs.

1117.In addition, the Tribunal notes that the residual risk register of the Feasibility Study
expressly includes the risk of “Underestimation of closure cost due to uncertainty in
regulatory closure requirements (e.g., pit backfilling requirements)” and assigned to this
risk a CAPEX impact of USD 20.6 million.'*'® This risk was incorporated by Prof. Davis
into his valuation model.'*'? Neither Respondent nor Ms. Filas have addressed the
quantification of this residual risk by Claimant and the Tribunal therefore has no basis to
assume that a buyer would have considered it insufficient.

1118. The Tribunal is also not convinced that Claimant’s plans for addressing a temporary toxic
pit lake that might form at closure of the mine were inadequate for a project at the
development stage of Reko Diq. Ms. Filas explicitly agreed that “there is significant time
to optimize the Conceptual Closure Plan ... over the life of the project.”'*° While she
maintained the opinion that the ESIA should have presented a plan for the mitigation of
unacceptable risks, the costs of which would then be carried over to the Feasibility Study,
the Tribunal has also taken note of Ms. Cessford’s explanations and the results of the pit
water balance studies and the modelling performed by SRK Consultating. On balance,
the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the possibility of a temporary toxic pit lake
forming at closure was a risk whose mitigation could not be addressed over the life of the
mine or that Claimant should have accounted for additional costs regarding the closure of
the mine. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that the overall closure cost estimate
accuracy was presented as being “in the range of +30% to -25%” and that the total closure
cost estimate of USD 110.6 million was therefore increased by an additional USD 20
million contingency.'4?! In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent and Ms. Filas have failed to
provide the Tribunal with a substantiated argument as to why this estimate would have
been considered insufficient.

1119.In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent and its expert Ms. Filas have failed to
convince the Tribunal that any of the alleged non-conformities of the ESIA in terms of
environmental impacts would have been an issue causing significant additional work
and/or costs for which Claimant should have accounted in the cost estimate included in
the Feasibility Study.

iii. Whether Claimant Adequately Addressed the Social Impacts of the
Project

1120. The Tribunal will therefore now turn to the social impacts addressed in the ESIA and the
criticisms raised by Dr. Connor.

1121.In her presentation at the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor stated, inter alia, that “[t]he

} iti lotel:

information on eline social « is ly inadeg ” which she
considered to be “particularly worrisome ... in terms of the conflict implications, as well
as there appears to be an almost complete lack of understanding of the local
organizational structure.” In her opinion, “[y]ou need to have much more information.
And that is missing in the ESIA, and that is absolutely required in the ESIA. That’s its

Job, is to do the assessment, determine the severity.” 472

1122. The Tribunal recalls that, as already discussed above, Dr. Connor placed emphasis on the
fact that certain information was supposed to be contained in the ESIA rather than any
other place of the project documentation and that if the ESIA for Reko Dig had gone to a
lender, “[t]hey would have said, This ESIA has to be ... completely redone. You haven't
identified all the impacts, and things like land aren't even addressed in it. You haven't
properly addressed the significance, and you haven't given the reader or me or anyone
else enough information to reach a conclusion about whether I would want to invest or
not.”'”3 Dr. Connor acknowledged that a lender would also have seen the Feasibility
Study but maintained that “their purposes are completely different.” In her opinion:

“The social aspect of the Feasibility Study level are up in the sky. They didn't
tell you anything. They give you a sort of overall view of how many people
might be affected if they locate the mine here, blah, blah, blah. That's why it
is so different from environmental.

That social assessment doesn't occur until the ESIA, until the Social Impact
Assessment. And that document would have to demonstrate to the lender that
you are serious and know what you're doing about the social impacts,
particularly those of the nature--the fragile and delicate nature and volatile
nature that I mentioned.”'**4

1123.In response to the question whether there were other documents addressing the socio-
political and security risks, Dr. Connor again maintained that these had to be addressed
in the ESIA “because that’s the document that assesses the risk of that to the Project, and
the risk of the Project to the people in that area.” She agreed that “‘you can have all kinds
of background documents” but considered that there was only “a sort of superficial
study.” Dr. Connor confirmed that she had reviewed Chapter 19 of the Feasibility Study

on Security but noted that she “wasn’t here to evaluate security” and argued that “[i]t
does not address—what what I am concerned about is the social person, is how do we
address the implications of the Project, how the Project is going to cause more conflict.
And it doesn't address that.”'*5

1124.As noted above, the Tribunal is not convinced by an argument that certain information
was to be contained in the ESIA rather than other parts of the documentation that would
also be submitted to a lender. To the extent that a certain assessment was made and the
information was thus available, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that any
issue regarding the location of the information could have been resolved without causing
significant additional costs or significant delay. While the Tribunal understands Dr.
Connor’s testimony to be that critical information on the social baseline conditions was
missing, including from other parts of the documentation, the Tribunal is not convinced
that this is in fact the case.

1125. The Tribunal agrees with Dr. Connor that the Chapter on Security in the Feasibility Study
may not have contained the social assessment she was looking for. However, Claimant
also asked its consultants from Hagler Bailly Pakistan to prepare a Socioeconomic
Baseline for Reko Diq Transport Corridors and Marine Terminal, which was completed
in July 2010.'*° It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether Dr. Connor was referring
to this report when opining that there was only “a sort of superficial study.” However, the
Tribunal notes that while Respondent frequently referred to the July 2010 report in its
Rejoinder on Quantum, Dr. Connor did not list it among the documents she consulted
when preparing her report.'*?? She rather listed a Cultural Baseline and Study of
Relationship Dynamics Draft Report dating from July 2009, which was considerably
shorter than the July 2010 report.'4?8

1126. As for the socio-economic baseline, Dr. Connor referred in her report to Section 6.3.2 of
the ESIA on Conflict in Balochistan, criticizing that it was “very brief and superficial”
and “only % page long.”'*?° Dr. Connor then discussed Section 8 of the ESIA containing
the Socioeconomic Impact Ass
Section 6.3.2 of the ESIA as the “baseline,”'**° without addressing the 160-page July

ssment but continued to refer in this discussion only to

 

2010 report on the Socioeconomic Baseline for Reko Dig Transport Corridors and Marine
Terminal. She also did not make any explicit reference to the 39-page July 2009 draft
report on the Cultural Baseline and Study of Relationship Dynamics. In the absence of
any engagement by Dr. Connor with these reports, the Tribunal cannot follow Dr.

Connor’s opinion that “[t]he information on baseline social conditions is completely
inadequate.”

1127.Dr. Connor further testified that “[t]here are no methods to manage ... the benefits the
project will have” and criticized that “[t]hose benefits are not in that part of the ESIA”
but only “some section on the kind of typical benefits that a mining project will bring
local employment ... and other kinds of community development and that sort of thing,
educational help and so on.”'**! She criticized that “[t]here is no implementation plan.
There is not one single discussion of how that was analyzed, who did it, who determined
that was the right thing to do, who determined that wasn't the wrong thing to do that
would divide and cause more conflict, who determined how they were going to figure out
what the recipients have, because if you give the wrong thing to the wrong group, you
may have a war on your hands.” In her opinion, there were only “‘some boilerplate
descriptions of, say, employment training plans that come out of ... any standard mining

company before they actually develop the plan.”\°*

1128.In her report, Dr. Connor referred to Section 1.3.3 and Table 8.1 of the ESIA in this
regard, which “identifies numerous benefits that the project would bring to Balochistan
and its people” but considered that “[t]his benefits description ... is a list of the general
types of benefits mining projects provide, rather than the detailed plans for delivery of
benefits needed to evaluate their effectiveness in maintaining LTO.”'* While the list of
documents consulted by Dr. Connor in preparing her report also included Chapter 13 of

the Feasibility on Community Relations, '4*4

she did not make any reference to this chapter
throughout her report, including to Section 13.5 on Community Management Plans,
which included a more detailed description of Claimant’s Community Engagement Plan,
Community Development Projects, Local Workforce Development, Education and
Training, Local Procurement and Supplier Development, and Management of In-
migration.'**> The Tribunal is not convinced that the description in the Feasibility Study
could reasonably be described as “some boilerplate descriptions” or “a list of the general
types of benefits mining projects provide” and, thus, that Dr. Connor’s criticisms
regarding the ESIA would also apply to the Chapter on Community Relations in the
Feasibility Study. As Dr. Connor did not engage with the content of Chapter 13, the
Tribunal cannot follow her opinion regarding the description of the benefits that Claimant
intended to bring to Balochistan.

1129.Dr. Connor further argued that Claimant had not developed a community development
strategy and, while acknowledging that “community development strategies and plans
typically evolve over and are revised over time,” the ESIA failed to explain “how these
efforts would be tailored to the conditions of the affected communities — the most
important factor in developing effective plans and in evaluating the likely outcome of
community support programs.”'+*6 Dr. Connor noted that the benefits “though a way off
from being turned into management plans” had been made known to the community
through disclosure and consultations and therefore considered that “[m]anaging these
expectations requires a great deal of skill, which does not seem to have been the case

with TCC’s Community Relations (CR) work or, at least, evidence is not available.”'437

1130.Dr. Connor then referred to a “Social Performance Specialist’s report from his 2009 visit”
in which it was noted that “community contributions at that stage were ad hoc consisting
largely of donations to sports events and some other minor activities in response to
requests, and these activities were being implemented in an uncoordinated way by
various non CR departments.” Dr. Connor agreed with the Social Performance Specialist
that “donations and responding to requests cause more problems than they resolve as
they lead to negative feelings of both those whose request is rejected, as well as those
whose request is accepted, but find the assistance insufficient or become entitlements over

time from which the company cannot extract itself without causing conflict.”'**

1131.At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor confirmed that she had relied in her report on a
contemporaneous assessment performed by Mr. Luc Zandvliet, whom she now described
as a Community Engagement Expert and “the only one out there I would have paid any

attention to and given me an opinion.”'**?

1132. The Tribunal notes that with regard to community development, Mr. Zandvliet stated in
his report of a trip to Reko Dig in March /April 2009 that “[a] community development
strategy is yet to be developed, which is normal is this phase of the project.”'“°

Consequently, and contrary to what Dr. Connor’s report suggests, he did not consider it

unusual that Claimant had not yet developed a community development strategy at the

time he visited the teams working on the project.

1133.Mr. Zandvliet then noted that “[t]he current approach largely consists of donations to
sports events, combined with a number of activities that were started, and are still being
implemented by departments other than CR” and that “[t]he donation policy is not likely

to yield a positive return on investment.” He proceeded to present various options for
community development, including to “[b]ase a short term community development
strategy on risk analysis and link it to the business case.” He noted that “[t]he main risks
to the Reko Diq project are related to the perceived lack of jobs and contracting
opportunities for local people, rather than the lack of community projects. This needs to
be reflected in the community development approach.”\**!

1134.As Dr. Connor placed emphasis on the expertise of Mr. Zandvliet as a community
engagement expert, the Tribunal considers it worth reviewing his trip report in more
detail. Mr. Zandvliet indeed made various observations and proposals indicating that
significant additional work would be required on the subject of community relations
before construction could start. For example, Mr. Zandvliet made the general observation
that “[c]onsistently and repeatedly, local stakeholders have expressed their - expectations
related to two main benefits: jobs and contracts for which they feel they are qualified.
These demands are reasonable but require a concerted effort on TCC’s part given current
local literacy levels and contracting capabilities. If construction does indeed commence
in Q2 2010, TCC’s efforts are currently not bold and comprehensive enough to provide
local people with realistic employment and contracting opportunities; the window of
opportunity is rapidly closing to train 5000+ people to a level of qualification for non-
or semi-skilled labor positions.” He then presented options on how this could be

achieved. !44?

1135. With regard to the community relations team, Mr. Zandvliet considered that “[t]here are
opportunities for the CR team to become more strategic in its approach to establish and
maintain local support and in allocating staff to achieve these objectives” and “an
opportunity to clarify the tasks of various members of the CR team to ensure that
duplication is avoided and some gaps are addressed.” He referred to certain measures
which had already been implemented during his trip and presented further options on how

the effectiveness of the community relations team could be improved in the future.'*47

1136.On stakeholder engagement, Mr. Zandvliet observed that “[t]here has been no systematic
and ongoing TCC presence in the various communities. This was in part due to
assumptions that too many visits would lead to questions and requests for which the
company would not have an answer.” He then reported that “[t]he CR team committed to
the implementation of a stakeholder engagement program, which will be systematically
followed starting the first week of May. The month of April will be used for 5 pilot
meetings. See Annex G for an overview which stakeholders will be met as well as the

frequency of engagement.” He also noted that “Stakeholders claim that, in the past, TCC
has made several promises that it never fulfilled’ but added that “[t]his perception is
typical for any project during the exploration stage” and referred to a new site-based
Communication Officer and a draft communication strategy which he had provided. He
again presented further options on how to improve stakeholder engagement. !4“4

1137.As for the grievance procedure, Mr. Zandvliet observed that it “has been implemented
and diligently followed by the grievance officer. The first cases have been closed.” He
noted that some Heads of Departments had dismissed the grievance SOP because it had
not been explained to them but noted that it would be publicized during the upcoming
round of public community meetings and again presented further options with regard to

the grievance procedure.'445

1138.Perhaps most urgently, Mr. Zandvliet addressed employment and hiring, observing that
“Tal staff recruiting strategy for the construction phase is still missing. On a site level, the
HAR department is mandated, and resourced, to look after existing employees (and
reportedly does that well). As a result, TCC has yet to start developing a hiring strategy
for 5,000-10,000 people-potentially starting within the year. Experience from other
mines shows the need to start planning for a recruitment exercise of 5,000-10,000 at least
one year in advance. Some mines have a full-time project team of 3-6 people on site at
least 6 months prior to the start of construction dedicated to preparation and
implementation of the recruitment effort. If a hiring strategy is not developed in the short
term, there will not be sufficient time to educate communities, and to design a mechanism
that provides maximum opportunities for local people, which will almost certainly
increase social risk to the project.” Following further observations on a lack of progress
on vocational training and a feeder program as well as a “Policy-Practice Gap” regarding
preferential recruitment, he again presented various options to address the issues he had
identified.'44°

1139. Finally, for Contracting, Mr. Zandvliet noted that “[a]t present, very few local businesses
benefit from the presence of TCC. Even many of the goods that local business people say
they can provide are sourced from Karachi or elsewhere. This is to assure quality of
produce as well as timely delivery” and that “[a]t the same time, the administration
department has made deliberate efforts to source locally but was confronted with sellers
who did not understand the modalities of working with a large company (e.g. they kept
raising their prices).” Mr. Zandvliet saw “tremendous opportunities to ensure that local
vendors and contractors benefit more from the TCC presence” and presented an option

which he considered “would be ‘low hanging fruit,’ possibly cost effective and would

demonstrate a visible commitment to TCC claims to support local people.”!4*"

At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor clarified that she did not know whether Mr.
Zandvliet’s recommendations had been followed. She also clarified, however, that while
she had not known at the time she had written her report that Mr. Zandvliet had been
retained by Claimant as a consultant, she learned shortly before the Hearing that Claimant
had offered him a contract after his trip report.'*48 As the criticisms raised by Dr. Connor
were raised for the first time in her report submitted together with Respondent’s Rejoinder
on Quantum, Claimant submitted certain additional documents which were admitted by
the Tribunal de bene esse and are now admitted into the record. Specifically in this
context, Claimant submitted a Reko Dig Flash Report dated July 2009 in which was noted
that “Luc Zandvliet has been retained as a consultant to support Community Relations

team.”'449

Dr. Connor explained that Mr. Zandvliet would often fly in for a brief visit at first and
then provide a proposal on how he could help “[a]nd in most cases, he goes in to help
them, and he’s quite good at it.”'*°° Against this background and taking into account that
Mr. Zandvliet’s initial observations dated from April 2009, i.e., one and a half years
before the Feasibility Study and ESIA were completed, the Tribunal considers it
reasonable to conclude that Claimant retained him in order to work on the areas he had
identified and implement some of the options he had proposed.

In the Tribunal’s view, this is also confirmed by the summaries of the community
initiatives that Claimant presented at the Hearing on Quantum: (i) the contributions that
Claimant had already made before applying for a mining lease (first slide); and (ii) the
contributions that Claimant planned to make after being granted the mining lease (second
slide):!4°!

to her and added that “[t]hey are not all in here, but there are pages that show
photographs of people doing this and that, and, you know, they are having this training
program and so on. So, there are lists periodically that have some of these things, yes.
So, I'm aware of this, yes.”'*°? In response to the question whether she would agree that
what matters to a local population would be what the company does rather than what it
writes or says, Dr. Connor responded:

“This has changed so much in the last 10 years, and I've been involved in that.
The old style was charity, and then it moved to sort of philanthropy, but that's

give people what you think they want so they will like you because they will
not like you. They will end up not liking you at all because it isn't really what
they need because you don't know really what they need.

You have to have--the banks will make you have a community development
program that is founded in a very sound assessment by people who are very
sound in doing this, and you will pick a handful of things to concentrate on.
So, you'll have a livelihood chapter, there will be a livelihood bucket, and you
might have two or three activities in that that you are going to do for the next
10 years. Maybe you'll have a health one. And you'll pick a few things, which
is usually like higher level, I said, you know, setting up systems.
Infrastructure? I never what [sic] to see anybody anything, but if you have to
put 5 percent of something in, do it, but it doesn't really make any difference,
because if they could build it, they would have done it. These Parties’
meetings, visits, you've going to do some of that. It's not a contribution. It may
make some people like you--and it may not--because in an environment like
this, what if you pick the wrong people to give things to? What if you give too
much to one group?”'*>

1144.Dr. Connor therefore maintained that “this scattershot kind of ‘let's just give them what

they want’ is bound to get you in trouble. I've never seen it not.”'44

1145.The Tribunal is not convinced, however, that Claimant’s approach was as random as Dr.
Connor’s testimony suggests. In particular, the Tribunal notes that actions presented on
these slides included several of the recommendations provided by Mr. Zandvliet in his
trip report of April 2009, such as, e.g., on the subject of Local Procurement & Hiring for
which Claimant identified several measures to achieve defined goals of sourcing certain
contract volumes from Balochistan within a specified timeframe.

1146. The Tribunal notes that these goals as well as other community initiatives that Claimant
planned to achieve after being granted a mining lease were communicated to the GOB
together with Claimant’s revised offer for the Reko Diq project submitted to Mr. Lehri
on 4 October 2010. This offer contained a Proposed Social Investment Plan setting out in
detail the initiatives contemplated by Claimant for Training & Education, Economic
Development & Procurement, and Infrastructure & Public Services, as well as Goodwill
contributions.'*>> In the final section on Budget and Fund Disbursement, it is noted that
“[olver the first 10 years, the project will invest US$ 100 million, equivalent to roughly
1.5% of the annual Ebidta [sic]. These financial commitments are additional to those
investments that will have to be made to comply with obligations described in the

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment.”'*°

1147.As this statement was made before the final ESIA was completed in November 2010, it
is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether and to which extent some of the initiatives
described in the revised offer were not contained in the ESIA. However, as noted above,

the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that amendments to the ESIA based on
already available information could have been made without causing significant
additional cost or delay if and when an agreement with the GOB had been reached on the
basis of this revised offer. This also corresponded to Ms. Cessford’s expectation that
further interaction with the regulatory authority would be required post-submission of the
ESIA.

1148.In any event, however, the Tribunal notes that the revised offer was submitted to Mr.
Lehri after the Feasibility Study had been delivered to the GOB in August 2010. As the
Feasibility Study included the cost estimates for the measures described in the ESIA, it
appears to the Tribunal that the additional costs of USD 100 million referred to in this
revised offer may not have been included in the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study.
This will be addressed further below.

1149. With regard to individual measures contemplated by Claimant, the Tribunal notes that
Dr. Connor testified at the Hearing on Quantum that she would personally not recommend

education “unless you are doing hi

during al c ity develoy
program that is defined in improving educational systems.” Similarly, she would not
recommend health programs “unless you are--you are going to have some because you
have to in an area, but you're not a health--you know, you don't know anything about
health.” When pointed to Claimant’s health impact assessment, Dr. Connor stated that “7
didn't really look at it. You know, I did look at it, but I know what the health conditions
are there because I occasionally review things for UNICEF and so on, so I know what
She then affirmed that she had looked at the health impact

assessment but testified that it was not listed in the documents she had reviewed because

the health conditions are.

“it’s not relevant to ... whether they can maintain a license to operate.”'*°’ She further
confirmed that she had received the health impact assessment only after her report and
clarified her answer that “that health report is all secondary information. I can get better
information than that from going somewhere else. But again, I didn't think it was relevant
to whether or not people would accept the benefits when they don't know what they are

against the adverse impacts when they don't know what those are.”'*8

1150.The health impact assessment was also submitted by Claimant in response to the
criticisms raised by Dr. Connor in her report, specifically that the ESTA did not adequately
address, inter alia, “deterioration in public health and increases in social ills associated
with population influx” as well as “human health and wellbeing.”'*°° The Health Impact
Assessment prepared by International SOS in September 2008 took into account at

various points of its impact analysis the influx of migrant people.'*° While the Tribunal
appreciates that this report was not available to Dr. Connor when she prepared her written
report, it cannot follow her explanation as to why she considered the 138-page report
irrelevant to her assessment of whether the population would accept the benefits
contemplated by Claimant with regard to health. Against this background, the Tribunal is
also not convinced by Dr. Connor’s criticism that Claimant failed to appropriate assess
the impact of the project on the local population and whether they would be outweighed
by the social benefits it planned to provide.

1151.In addition, the Tribunal notes that while Dr. Connor expressed the opinion that Claimant
focused on the wrong areas of community initiatives, she did not provide an estimate of
the costs that would have been associated with initiatives that she would have considered
more adequate.

1152.In her report, Dr. Connor stated:

“The continuous effort to maintain LTO would involve substantial
expenditure in cost and time and highly skilled social and community experts
with experience in conflict management, particularly in Balochistan and/or
similar environments. This Expert is not in a position to evaluate the costs for
such an effort as given in the TCC budget. The ESIA does not discuss the
human resources TCC has or intends to recruit in any detail, which is a
serious omission because it suggests that TCC is not aware of the expertise
and experience that will be needed to deal with sensitive issues like license to
operate in this project’s context. Moreover, highly skilled experts are not
numerous and most are already engaged in other projects. TCC
documentation indicates that staff will be trained, but does not address who
will do this training and mentoring or when it would have begun.”\4°!

1153. At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Connor clarified with regard to the costs she had referred
to that “[t]he costs are indirect. You are going to be doing all these other things to make
sure that you're bringing the right benefits and so on. So, there are the engagement costs
and so on, but they are the costs of running your Project properly.” She further clarified
that in addition to the benefits brough to the local communities, “[y]ou're going to work
with the Government higher up to maybe improve the Ministry of Mines. You are going
to do all kinds of stuff: If give yourself enough time, you find out what are rights things to
do, and then you are not wasting money and upsetting people. So, those are the costs I'm
talking about.” Dr. Connor added that she was not able to predict the costs as “they were

nowhere near to figuring out what those were going to be.”'4°

1154. When pointed to Claimant’s presentation of the amount that it was planning to spend on

community initiatives, i.e., USD 406.5 million, '4° Dr. Connor testified:

“Well, it's got a number down there that isn't meaningful. It's got a number
for these things it's decided to do, which I don't think they should be doing at
all, at least some of them. So, is that a lot of money for a size of project like
this? Yeah, it could be. I don't know. But there's nothing--I can't evaluate
amounts of money because I'm not accepting their community programs, most
of them.”'46+

1155.In addition, with regard to the “highly skilled experts” she had referred to in her report,

Dr. Connor emphasized that even if Mr. Zandvliet may have been retained by Claimant,
“you still have to have the staff,” i.e., “a very large community staff,” including a “very
skilled community manager,” within the confines of an Environmental and Social
Management System.'4% In her opinion, “this Project is just way, way up the road, and
they did not have anywhere near the right staff to develop this, so they have to acquire
these social managers and supporting Experts” such as “a conflict management expert to
assess that and see what needs to be done.” Dr. Connor added that “I’m sure it could be
done, but it would take a long time” and stated that it would take “a minimum of two
years, might be much longer than that’ to implement the necessary risk management
measures. She maintained, however, that “it wouldn’t have been anytime soon, and they
would not have been able to demonstrate adequately to a lender that they would get

license to operate.” '*°°

1156.As for the costs aspect, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Connor did not consider the amount

that Claimant planned on spending on community initiatives too low. She stated that “it
could be ... a lot of money for a site of project like this” but could not provide an answer
because she did not accept most of the community programs as such. As the Tribunal is
not convinced by Dr. Connor’s criticisms on these community programs, it also has no
basis to doubt that the amount Claimant planned to spend on these would be inadequate.

1157.Finally, as for Dr. Connor’s concern regarding the availability of skilled experts and

1463

personnel to implement the community relation programs envisaged by Claimant, the
Tribunal considers that while concerns regarding recruitment are also reflected in Mr.
Zandvliet’s trip report, these concerns did not relate specifically to the community
relations team but more generally to the workforce of 5,000+ people required for
construction. The Tribunal is not convinced that to retain professional community
relations personnel would have been significantly more difficult than to retain the various
experts and consultants as well as employees that Claimant retained in other areas of the

project, including those that have been discussed in detail in this Award. In any event, the
Tribunal is not convinced that recruitment of qualified community relations personnel
would have formed a valid basis for an assumption that the project could not obtain and
maintain a social license to operate.

1158.In conclusion, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced by any of the criticisms raised by
Respondent and its expert Dr. Connor regarding alleged shortcomings of the ESIA in
terms of assessing the social impacts. In particular, the Tribunal has no basis to assume
that a lender would have considered the cost that Claimant contemplated to spend on the
community programs it had described insufficient.

1159.The Tribunal recalls, however, that some of these programs were included only in the
revised offer submitted to the GOB in October 2010 and that an amount of USD 100
million was thus apparently not included in the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study. As
Claimant itself has relied on the additional financial commitments made in the revised
offer to demonstrate the adequacy of its community initiatives, the Tribunal considers it
reasonable to assume that a buyer would also have factored these additional costs into its
valuation of the project.

1160. The Tribunal notes that, according to Claimant’s submission in its Quantum Post-Hearing
Brief, the offer to spend an additional USD 100 million of October 2010 would have
increased the amount of USD 406.5 million that Claimant and its owners were prepared
to spend at the Feasibility Study stage.'*°” In support of its argument that the amount of
USD 406.5 million was contemplated already at Feasibility Study stage and thus included
in the cost estimates, Claimant referred to its opening statement and the slide in its
opening presentation, which in turn refers to the Chapter on Community Relations in the
Feasibility Study and the revised offer of October 2010.!4°8 The Chapter on Community
Relations does not, however, provide for a cost estimate of the community relations
measures it describes. The Tribunal is also not convinced that the full amount of USD
406.5 million is included in the estimates of the capital costs and operating costs in
Chapters 23 and 24 of the Feasibility Study.'4”

1161.In any event, Claimant itself clearly presented the additional community initiatives
outlined in the revised offer as part of the initiatives whose total costs it calculated to be
at USD 406.5 million.'*”° This confirms the Tribunal’ s conclusion that the cost estimates

of the Feasibility Study did not yet include the additional USD 100 million that Claimant
offered to spend in October 2010.

1162. The Tribunal notes that Respondent did not dispute that the amount of USD 406.5 million
reflected the cost estimates in the Feasibility Study plus the revised offer of October 2010
but only relied on Dr. Connor’s testimony to argue that “the contributions and
expenditures TCC outlined in slides 104 and 105 of their opening presentation does little
to show that TCC understood the social risks, assessed those risks, and properly planned
to mitigate those risks.”'*" These criticisms have been addressed in detail above. In the
absence of a challenge on the total amount presented by Claimant at the Hearing on
Quantum, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to examine in further detail whether
the amount (except for the additional USD 100 million contained in the revised offer)
accurately sums up the various estimates for community relations-related costs in the
estimates of capital costs and operating costs.

iv. Whether Prof. Davis Has Adequately Accounted for the Costs and Risks
A iated with the Envir 1 and Social I ts of the Project

1163.Consequently, the Tribunal will now turn to the final question whether Prof. Davis has
adequately accounted for the costs and risks associated with the environmental and social
impacts of the project.

1164. The Tribunal was not convinced by the criticisms raised by Ms. Filas and Dr. Connor
regarding the impact assessment that Claimant had made and the measures it had
identified to mitigate those impacts. As neither Ms. Filas nor Dr. Connor engaged with
the cost estimates in the Feasibility Study, the Tribunal also has no reason to doubt that
these estimates fully account for the contemplated mitigation measures.

1165. However, the Tribunal recalls Ms. Cessford’s testimony regarding expected interactions
with the regulatory authority and potential investors, which might have led to additional
work and thus additional costs for further studies and/or additional mitigation measures
that might have to be included in order to obtain a certain permit or funding. The Tribunal
therefore considered it a relevant question whether Claimant and/or Prof. Davis included
adequate contingency for such additional costs and possibly also delays in the start of
construction.

1166.Ms. Cessford testified that the ESTA team had “been scoped to interact with the regulator
post-submission” and to “undertake the feedback stakeholder of consultation” in parallel
with a Public Hearing. In addition, the team was “expecting to have to, as part of our
work with the interaction with the stakeholders and the regulators—to possibly have to
make amendments to the ESIA.” Ms. Cessford further testified that the ESIA team had

471 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, { 218.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 399 of 1447

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -388-

also “been scoped with providing input into TCC’s development of their Management
Plans.” With regard to investors, she stated that the team had only been scoped to produce
a “Glorified Executive Summary” of the ESIA Report, i.e., “a much longer Executive
Summary, suitable for investors that explained the process and the interaction with the
project engineers.” Ms. Cessford added that while they “had not been scoped in this
case,” based on her experience with other projects, they “had expected to have further
interactions with any investors, respond to questions, possibly undertake additional
studies, such as on issues they raised, and to develop action plans to address any gaps
that they might identify that they felt needed further work.” 4”?

1167. Based on Ms. Cessford’s testimony, it appears to the Tribunal that while the ESIA team
had not yet been specifically scoped for further interactions with potential investors and
potential follow-up actions, the ESIA team expected and was prepared for these
interactions. The question is whether they were costed.

1168.As pointed out by Claimant, the risk register included, inter alia, the following
environmental risks: (i) “Underestimation of closure cost due to uncertanty in regulatory
closure requirements (e.g., pit backfilling requirements)”; and (ii) “Changes in design
criteria necessitated from the output of environmental baseline may result in significant
changes in infrastructure designs/layout.” For both risks, Claimant has assigned a
CAPEX impact of USD 20.6 million and USD 0.7 million (following risk mitigation),
respectively.'*7* In addition, the risk register also included certain permitting & approval
risks, including: (i) “Delay in the ESIA approval process caused by ESIA complexity,
resulting in a delay of the project”; and (ii) “Delays in ESIA submittal due to changes in
the project description, resulting in a delay of the project.” For the first of these risks,
Claimant assigned an OPEX impact (following risk mitigation measures aimed at
adherence to the relevant guidelines and establishing a relationship with the GOB) of
USD 1.0 million.'*” Prof. Davis classified both of these risks as risks that could cause
project start-up delay and thereby incorporated them into his estimate of the expected
timeframe between completion of the Feasibility Study and start of construction, which

will be addressed in more detail below.'475

1169.As for the environmental risk of additional closure costs, the Tribunal has already
concluded above that it has no basis to assume that the quantification of this risk was
insufficient. As for the other risks identified by Claimant with regard to the ESTA, the
Tribunal is not entirely convinced that Claimant thereby also accounted for the

“additional studies” that Ms. Cessford expected to possibly have to conduct on the ESIA
following interactions with potential investors and “the action plans to address any gap
that [the potential investors] might identify that they felt needed further work.”'47
However, neither Respondent nor its experts have addressed the cost estimates included
in the Feasibility Study for ESTA-related measures, nor have they provided the Tribunal
with any estimate or range of the cost that would usually be expected for additional work

following the initial submission of an ESIA to the regulatory authorities and/or a lender.

1170.In the absence of any such figure, the Tribunal sees no basis to conclude that Claimant or

Prof. Davis should have incorporated a further cost into the valuation of the Reko Diq
project.

1171.In addition, the Tribunal notes that the risk register also included certain community

relations risks such as, in particular, the risk of “Disruption to construction and
operations caused by political and community opposition to the project leading to project
delay. This can be related (but not limited to): a) perceived insufficient employment
opportunities for Chagai people; b) a perceived lack of contracting opportunities for
Chagai vendors and contractors; c) labor conditions during construction d) lay-offs at
the end of the construction phase; e) local dependency on the mine at the time of mine
closure; f) efforts of ‘other companies’ to stir up anti-TCC sentiments.” This risk was
described by Claimant as “the key Community Risk — to be reviewed to include updates.
Review further once port risks are better understood.” Claimant identified several risk
mitigation measures; it did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX impact to this risk.'47’ Prof.

Davis classified it as “not material” as it had an impact rating of 3.!478

1172.Claimant further identified the risk of “Disaffected communities caused by water

shortages or the perceived waste of water for the pipeline-Fan Sediments(Pakistan

identified “comprehensive public Itation and stakeholde within the
water affected areas” as risk mitigation measures; it did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX

of 1.'*8° A similar risk was identified for the alternative water sources contemplated for
the expansion scenario and qualified as “not material’ as it had an impact rating of 3.'48!

1173.Claimant also identified the risk of “The influx of jobseekers upsets existing social
dynamics, causes pressure on already scarce local resources resulting in protest by host
communities, especially in Nokkundi.” It identified several risk mitigation measures and
then assigned a CAPEX impact of USD 0.2 million to this risk, which was also
incorporated into Prof. Davis’ valuation model. 48?

1174. Claimant further pointed to the fact that Prof. Davis had accounted for the risk of events
caused by extreme political violence or government action by modeling an annual
probability of 0.5% that there would be a permanent shutdown of the mine. The Tribunal
has addressed this aspect in detail in its analysis of the security-related risks above.

1175.As will be discussed further below, Prof. Davis also accounted for the risk of project
delays and the additional costs associated with these delays.

1176.In the absence of any opinion provided by Dr. Connor on additional costs that she would
have considered necessary to be spent on community relations and also taking into
account that the risk register identified the community initiatives contemplated by
Claimant as risk mitigation measures, the Tribunal considers it plausible that Prof. Davis
has classified the community relations risks set out above as “not material” and thereby
did not model any separate financial impact in this regard. In this regard, the Tribunal
also notes that as will be discussed below, Prof. Davis assumed in his valuation that
substantial delays would be incurred between the completion of the Feasibility Study and
the start of construction, which are based on a large dataset of mining companies around
the world. In the Tribunal’s view, there is no basis to assume that any of the community
relations risks would have delayed the project beyond the delays modeled by Prof. Davis.

1177.As a final point, the Tribunal recalls that the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study
apparently did not include the additional amount of USD 100 million that Claimant
proposed to spend in its revised offer of 4 October 2010 and that a buyer would therefore
also have factored into its valuation of the project. The Tribunal also sees no indication
that Prof. Davis included these additional costs into his valuation model.

1178.Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that while it has no basis to assume that Claimant
and Prof. Davis did not fully account for the measures and risks that Claimant had
identified, a deduction has to be made to account for the additional amount of USD 100
million that Claimant proposed to spend on its Social Investment Program pursuant to its
revised offer of 4 October 2010.

Permits and Land Rights Required for the Project

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

1179.Claimant submits that none of the allegations raised by Respondent with regard to
permitting established an impact on the valuation of the project beyond the delays that
Prof. Davis has already incorporated into his valuation model. Claimant contends that: (i)
it did not experience significant problems securing approvals, licenses or permits for the
project; (ii) it took appropriate steps to address future permitting needs; and (iii) in any
event, Prof. Davis incorporated longer delays into his model than any of the delays posited

by Respondent.'*8

1180.Claimant submits that before the GOB decided to unlawfully take over the project in
December 2009, Claimant had obtained all permits required for the exploration and
feasibility stage and a team of in-house and external local consultants from Hagler Bailly
Pakistan had identified the permits and approvals needed to proceed to construction and
operation. In Claimant’s view, “there is every indication that TCC would have been able
to secure all necessary permits and authoriziations without any greater delay than Prof.
Davis has already modeled” if the authorities had continued to cooperate with Claimant
in good faith. It further argues that to seek the permits required for operation before

obtaining the Mining Lease would have been premature and cost-inefficient.'4**

1181.Claimant points out that it did not experience any significant difficulties in obtaining
permits and approvals over the nearly two decades at Reko Diq until the GOB decided to
take over the project in December 2009.'4*° In Claimant’s view, the examples relied on
by Respondent “bear little if any resemblance to Reko Dig and the sparsely populated
areas which the proposed pipeline would traverse.” In particular, Claimant points out that
Reko Dig is located in an isolated area with “minimal” negative interference with local
communities. In addition, Claimant considers that when discussing the Reko Dig project,
Respondent ignored Balochistan’s contractual obligation as Claimant’s joint venture
partner to assist Claimant in obtaining “all leases, licenses, permits or other authorities
of any kind whatsoever’ that were required for the project.'#8°

1182.Claimant also emphasizes that Respondent has not referred to any permitting problems
experienced by other mining projects in Balochistan and refused to produce documents
that would disclose any such problems experienced by other projects.'#*” In its view,
Respondent’s reference to Pakistan’s ranking for ease of doing business is irrelevant
given that: (i) “industry practice shows that mining companies operate successfully in

Republic, Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Afghanistan and Iran; and (ii) Barrick had experience

Dominican Republic, Zambia, Papua New Guinea and Argentina. '48*

1183. Specifically with regard to the land acquisition for the slurry pipeline, Claimant refers to

the oral testimony of Respondent’s expert Mr. Rahman in which he acknowledged that
he was not aware that the pipeline route was specifically designed to avoid populated
areas or that earlier public interest litigation involving Reko Diq had been “speedily
resolved” with the assistance of the GOB and that he had not considered the potential

value increase of the owners’ remaining land as an incentive to support the project.'*8?

1184. With regard to Respondent’s reference to a pending litigation between Claimant and

Benway Corp., Claimant contends that it is unrelated and in any event “well-settled
Pakistani law that pending litigation does not bar the alienation of immovable property
rights.”'4°° Claimant further argues that Respondent and Mr. Rahman failed to mention
the special procedure under the Land Acquisition Act under which land can be acquired
on an urgent basis, “eliminating almost all the delays and litigation Pakistan claims TCC
would have faced.” Specifically, Claimant refers to Section 17 which provides the Federal
Government with full discretion to take possession of land “free from all encumbrances”
after only 15 days’ notice, with interested litigants having to “vie for the deposited funds

afterwards.”\*'

1185. As for the alleged water-related disputes, Claimant notes that it had obtained all necessary

authorizations for the Fan Sediments and adds that they were chosen because there were
no competing users and there would therefore be no expectation of extensive public
comment. Claimant further submits that the pipeline was designed to go under riverbeds
and would therefore not impact them, and Mr. Mayer confirmed that Claimant had the
required permits and also planned on keeping No-Objection Certificates (NOCs).
Claimant also submits that the expiry of an NOC during the PSI field study for the

pipeline did not impact the survey as it was renewed within four days.'*?

1186. With regard to alleged permitting issues at Port Gwadar associated with the port operator,
Claimant refers to “multiple trade-off studies concerning the port” and “positive
responses to preliminary inquiries into acquiring the necessary land.” Claimant notes
that Respondent failed to identify any permit or authorization that Claimant should have
had as of the valuation date and further points to the fact that in 2013, Pakistan signed a
40-year concession contract with a new operator and the port is now operating

normally. 49

1187.Claimant also points out that by contrast to a difficulty of the Duddar project in relocating
a small village, it had already secured voluntary relocation from all inhabitants of the Siah

Reg village.'4"*

1188. According to Claimant, Respondent ignored the iterative nature of the permitting process
by continuing to rely on the Draft Permits Register even though Claimant had: (i)
submitted later versions of the Register which addressed topics that Respondent claimed
were overlooked; and (ii) referred to other chapters and appendices of the Feasibility
Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study as well as other documents which contained
“substantial additional information and analyses concerning permitting.” In
particular, Claimant notes that both Studies dedicated entire chapters to permitting, which
confirm, in its view, that its team was well acquainted with Pakistani and Baloch
bureaucracy and drew on its previous experience with the Tanjeel project to determine

appropriate assumptions on the scheduling of other environmental permits. '4°°

1189.Claimant also notes that the Draft Permit Register “carefully mapped” all necessary
permits and identified the competent authority, applicable legislation, submission
procedure, date by which the permit would be needed, estimate time for approval, validity
period, and other relevant information. Claimant describes it as a “live working
document” which would continue to be updated during the project and was in fact updated
until 2011 when the Mining Lease Application was denied.'*°”

1190.In any event, Claimant contends that even if Respondent’s allegations were true, it did
not show that the alleged difficulties would have been insurmountable, that they would

have deterred potential investors, or that they would have substantially affected the
viability or value of the project.'#°* It emphasizes that Prof. Davis has incorporated into
his model “Jong delays to capture the potential advserse effects of any permitting

challenges,” i.e., an average delay of over two years before the start of construction,

which reduced the estimated value of the project by approximately USD 1.3 billion.'*°?

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

1191.Respondent submits that any forward-looking valuation methodology to be accepted by
an arbitral tribunal requires the entity to show that it had the necessary permits. By
contrast, Respondent claims that “TCC did not even know all of the permits it needed, did
not appreciate the practical difficulties of operating in Balochistan, and failed to account
for the specific difficulties of getting permits for the project.”!>

1192.Respondent notes that from 2006 to 2011, Pakistan “slid down the rankings for ease of
doing business” and adds that while Balochistan’s capital city, Quetta, “remained near
the bottom,” the situation in rural areas was worse. Specifically, Respondent refers to
unclear processes for obtaining permits and “a web of regulatory agencies and an array
of permits at all different levels” as well as to the involvement of numerous public
hearings and “protracted public interest litigation.” Referring to its expert Mr. Rahman,
Respondent contends that “one of the biggest delays” would be land acquisition, which

can take “years, even decades.”!*!

1193. Respondent points out that land acquisition “is completely absent in the Permits Register”
and argues that there is no indication how Claimant intended to address this issue for the
slurry and water pipelines or who were in fact the title holders of the lands. In
Respondent’s view, Claimant provided only “a general overview of land rights and the
Land Acquisition Act with no plan for implementation.” According to Respondent, this is
insufficient, taking into account that: (i) 50-70 tribes can be found along the pipeline
route; (ii) there are no land records for 90% of the land in Balochistan which means that
“hundreds of people can assert claims to the same land’; and (iii) a “lengthy

administrative and public process ... must be undergone to get approvals.” °°

1194. Respondent also points to “lengthy court battles” on “these issues” and maintains that
regardless of the width of the land that Claimant planned to acquire, it would have to
undergo the land acquisition process described by Mr. Rahman.'°°? Respondent
emphasizes that Claimant was involved in many litigations regarding Reko Dig, including
almost seven years of litigation regarding the validity of the CHEJVA, petitions filed to
enjoin the Governments from issuing a mining lease to Claimant, petitions filed by the
Watan party and the Sanjrani tribe in November 2010 and January 2011 as well as still
pending litigation filed by Benway against Claimant in 2008 regarding an alleged
infringement of its rights over Exploration License EL-24.'°+ With regard to the latter
litigation, Respondent submits that the company had sued Claimant to invalidate
Claimant’s surface rights and argues that Claimant could therefore not have transferred
the surface rights to a third party without a risk of litigation impeding the plans for Reko
Digq. In any event, Respondent considers that while surface rights “may have some effect

at that time,” they do not convey ownership but a claim to ownership. °°

1195.Respondent further relies on Mr. Rahman’s opinion that while there are also permitting
issues and significant delays in urban areas, the framework in the remote parts of
Balochistan is different as there is no accurate record-keeping, inter-tribal rivalries can
frustrate the process of acquiring permits and the exploitation of natural resources can
quickly become existential threats and trigger a backlash. In Respondent’s view, this is
confirmed by previous hunger strikes at Reko Dig, a “shutter down” among merchants in
Nok Kundi, the concerns raised by people in the communities along the pipeline route

and the protests at Gwadar.'*°°

1196.Respondent submits that a site visit of the pipeline route revealed that certain portions
that PSI could not map were riverbeds but Claimant failed to describe the process of
seeking permits in a riverbed or drainage. According to Respondent, it is “highly unlikely
that TCC could have rapidly received a permit to run a pipeline of toxic sludge through
a riverbed that provides some of the only water for miles around.” Given the scarcity of
water in Balochistan, Respondent claims that the opposition to a slurry pipeline in

riverbed would have been “massive.”!5"7

1197.Respondent further refers to Mr. Rahman who identified numerous permits and approvals
that Claimant had failed to identify, including for the construction and operation of an oil

storage facility, for coastal and marine security, for the railway, and for construction in a
canal or drainage. Respondent also refers to the “largely blank’ section of the Permits
Register dealing with Port Gwadar, the “secret sludge dump,” increased pollution at the
mine site and the planned discharge into the Arabian Sea.!°°* Respondent contends that
Claimant failed to address in its Permit Register the treatment and disposal of sludge,
acquisition of the water rights required to ensure the viability of the project, and land

acquisition for the construction and erection of the pipeline.'*

1198. Specifically with regard to water rights, Respondent notes that Claimant acknowledged a
“high risk for permitting and approvals regarding water rights” given that it stated in the
Feasibility Study that “draw down of water by others leaves insufficient water for project
needs — caused by current legislation not explicitly protecting the rights to use water
(quantity and duration), which results in the need to develop alternative sources.”'>!°

Respondent further notes that Claimant’s risk mitigation strategy involved addressing the

issue in the Mineral Agreement and obtaining support from the GOB and emphasizes

that: (i) the risk still had a residual risk rating of M10, meaning a “likely” likelihood rating
and an impact of 3; and (ii) the risk of not reaching a Mineral Agreement was ranked even

higher.!5!!

1199.Respondent submits that in order to obtain a permit for extracting ground water, prior
permission must be sought from the District Water Committee, which invites interested

stakeholders to submit objections and may then grant the permit “subject to any
conditions it deems necessary” or “flatly reject the application’’; any aggrieved party can
file an appeal against the decision. Respondent adds that there is no provision under the
law providing for “exclusive” water rights and a permit is subject to a specified
timeframe.'°!? According to Respondent, the 2014 Balochistan Ground Water Rights
Administration Rules grant discretionary power to manage groundwater sources even
after a permit has been granted and refers to several provisions granting the Provincial

Water Authority the authority to suspend or even cancel a permit.!>!*

1200. Respondent notes that Claimant claims to have broad water extraction rights not only with
regard to the Fan Sediments but also for three other areas but emphasizes that the permit
relating to these other areas covered only the exploratory phase as it was restricted to
tubewells. In Respondent’s view, it is unclear whether this permit would have to be

renewed once the Mining Lease had been granted. As for No-Objection Certificates relied
on by Claimant, Respondent notes that an NOC “creates some rights” but does not convey

ownership. !>!4

1201.More generally, Respondent refers to Mr. Rahman’s opinion that Claimant’s time
estimations for the permits listed “are very naive” and the Permits Register lacked
sufficient information in particular on the permits required for the construction of the
pipeline.'°!5 Respondent emphasizes that Claimant was planning to commence
construction in September 2011 and maintains that it “had not meaningfully begun the
permitting process.” According to Respondent, the Permits Register was missing “basic
information that TCC should have confirmed well in advance of project implementation”
and Claimant therefore failed to show that it was ready to execute the project.'>!®

1202. Respondent argues that the “real-life examples” utilized by Mr. Rahman demonstrate the
obstacles faced by infrastructure projects in Pakistan which in some cases caused the
projects to be suspended or completely abandoned or stalled for “years on end.”!>!7
Respondent notes that Claimant did not rebut these assertions, nor did it present its own
expert of permitting issues in Balochistan, but only pointed to the delay incorporated into
Prof. Davis’ model. In this regard, Respondent submits that Prof. Davis based his
calculation on data for mines located in jurisdictions in low threat environments or with
highly developed mining industries and infrastructure such as Chile and therefore
considers this data not sufficiently representative to calculate the expected delay that may
occur in Balochistan. Respondent further claims that Prof. Davis ignored delays that
Claimant had already experienced and notes that “the PSI team lost almost half of the

planned days of fieldwork due to permitting issues.”>'8

1203.Respondent also contends that Claimant and Prof. Davis failed to account for potential

additional costs caused by “conditions to the permits or other mitigating factors” in light

of stakeholder objections.'*!?

1204. According to Respondent, Balochistan was not under a contractual obligation to issue
permits and approvals and, in any event, its alleged obligation to provide administrative
assistance did not guarantee that Claimant would face no delays or obtain the necessary

approvals, given that even “national emergency projects” face delays or stalling.
Respondent notes that the types of approval and permits required for mining operations
would have: (i) required public consultation; (ii) involved different stakeholders; and (iii)
to be issued by both provincial and federal governments.'>” Respondent emphasizes that
Government-owned projects were specifically targets of insurgents and outside forces
and notes that the GOB could not have prevented people from protesting or making
competing claims to the same piece of land. In addition, Respondent refers to delays
already incurred by the PSI team regarding NOCs and points to the Tribunal’s finding
that Claimant had obtained prior approvals such as visa for its employees through a

bribery scheme.!*?!

1205.In response to Claimant’s reliance on the lack of prior permitting problems, Respondent
argues that the prior process is “a poor proxy to understand the issues in 2011” as
Claimant’s prior exploratory work had had a “much lesser impact on the community and
environment and was not significantly intrusive enough to raise much objection” and
claims that permitting for large-scale mining operations that would “stretch the length of
the province, affect all nearby communities, pollute the air and ocean, and deplete
precious scarce water resources would have resulted in much higher scrutiny by GoB
and community stakeholders during the required public consultations.” In particular,
Respondent refers to the introduction of a slurry pipeline ending at Port Gwadar, which
opened “a new world of permitting requirements,” and new tensions at Nok Kundi and

Gwadar, which would have made the permitting process more difficult. !°??

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

1206. At the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal takes note of Respondent’s submission that
“Ta]ny damages valuation that relies on a forward-looking methodology must be able to
show that the entity had the necessary permits.”'° It also argues that “[n]umerous
tribunals have recognized that the absence of government approvals can keep a project
from a forward-looking, income-based valuation” and generally refers to its submissions

on why it considers a DCF valuation and in particular the Modern DCF methodology

applied by Prof. Davis inappropriate.!°*4

1207. The Tribunal has addressed the Parties’ arguments regarding the valuation methodology
to be applied in this case in detail above and has reached the conclusion that in the
particular circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to determine the value of Claimant’s
investment by using a DCF method and, more specifically, by using the modern DCF
approach presented by Claimant and its expert Prof. Davis. In its analysis, the Tribunal
has taken into account the development stage of the Reko Diq project, including the fact
that it had not yet received all necessary permits and approvals to commence mining
operations.

1208. Consequently, and while it does not wish to make a generalized statement on this matter,
the Tribunal also considers that in the circumstances of the present case, Claimant does
not have to show that it already “had the necessary permits” in order for Prof. Davis’
methodology to be applicable. Claimant rather has to establish that it was prepared for
what a buyer would have expected when purchasing a project at the development stage
of Reko Dig, i.e., that relevant permits and approvals had either already been obtained or
that Claimant had a reasonable plan and schedule to obtain them in time for the project to
start construction and, subsequently, mining operations.

1209.In addition, and while it has not yet assessed whether the delays modeled by Prof. Davis
are adequate, the Tribunal agrees with the general approach that any risk associated with
relevant permits or approvals not being obtained in time to commence construction and/or
mining operations on schedule would be factored into the valuation by modeling expected
or potential delays in the start of construction or mining operations. In the Tribunal’s
view, the viability of the project could be affected only if there are specific indications
supported by concrete evidence that a certain permit or approval could not be obtained or
at least could not be obtained within an economically reasonable timeframe.

1210. Against this background, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has not identified a specific
permit or approval, which Claimant had not yet obtained but which a buyer would have
expected to be already obtained at the valuation date. Respondent notes that as per the
ESIA, Claimant was planning to commence construction in September 2011 and claims
that “TCC had not yet meaningfully begun the permitting process.”'>* It does not,
however, state which specific permit Claimant should have already obtained or applied
for at the valuation date (in addition to the Mining Lease for which TCCP applied in
February 2011) in order to commence construction of the project as contemplated. In this
regard, the Tribunal also notes that while the ESIA provides for the start of construction
in general in September 2011, it also provides for subsequent dates at which construction
was to start for: (i) the plant and concentration transportation facilites (May 2012); and

(ii) port infrastructure (October 2012). Mechanical completion of the mine was scheduled
to occur in December 2014.'°?° The Tribunal therefore agrees with Claimant that “[t]o
seek the permits needed to operate the mine, before TCC obtained the Mining Lease,
would have been premature and cost-inefficient, and a third-party investor would not

have expected TCC to have do so prior to the Valuation Date.”'>?"

1211.Specifically with regard to the pipeline, Respondent raises concerns with regard to the
acquisition of land which would necessarily have to precede the construction of the
pipeline. As Respondent claims that “[I]and acquisition can take years, even decades,”!>*8
this implies the argument that a buyer would have expected Claimant to have already
started the process of acquiring the land for the pipeline at the valuation date. Therefore,
the Tribunal will address this issue first before turning to the Parties’ submissions on other

permits and approvals for the project.

i. Whether Claimant Had a Feasible Plan for the Acquisition of Land, in
Particular for the Pipeline to Port Gwadar

1212.In support of its argument on land acquisition, Respondent relies on the opinion of its
expert Mr. Rahman who explained in his first expert report the procedure for the
acquisition of land under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 and, based on his knowledge
and experience, stated that “/and acquisition has been a significant hurdle in pipeline
projects in Pakistan.” Noting that the slurry pipeline would go through several districts
and would therefore require approval from different Revenue Officials in each district,
Mr. Rahman considered it “difficult to say how long it would take to acquire the land and
upon what conditions, specifically keeping mind local community resistance and potential
objections/litigation on the basis, inter alia, of land ownership or compensation related
disputes.” He noted that the had worked on pipeline projects “where land acquisition has
taken as long as 18 months” and expressed the opinion that it would have taken
“considerably longer” for the slurry pipeline “since this was a private party acquiring
land, which involves extra difficulties, and the land acquisition was in Balochistan with
all the challenges facing projects in the said province.” Mr. Rahman added that he was
not aware of any pipeline of the nature that Claimant proposed having been laid by a

private party in Pakistan. '*2°

1213.In his second report, Mr. Rahman specified that he considered the public objections phase
the most critical aspect, because “not only is the local populace and generally the
Pakistani public hostile to the Reko Dig project, but there are practical difficulties that

will arise during the public consultations phase or otherwise.” In particular, Mr. Rahman
referred to the absence of land records for most of the land in Balochistan, which he
considered to be “particularly problematic for the land acquisition procedure because
there are several nomadic tribes living in the vast areas between Reko Dig and the
Balochistan coast .... who can claim ownership of the land and raise objections to its
acquisition for the purposes of the Reko Dig project.” He added that “[a]ny forcible
construction of the pipeline in such areas would have most likely led to some form of
conflict with local tribes, which potentially could have turned violent.” Mr. Rahman
further expressed the opinion that the involvement of government departments or security
forces would not necessarily make land acquisition easier and refers to an example in
which 13,500 acres of land in Balochistan were acquired by the Pakistan Navy which “led
to several protests and public displays of anger.” Mr. Rahmen further considered that any
problem associated with the acquisition of land “would have been multiplied by the
amount of land that would have been needed to be acquired for the construction of the

slurry pipeline.” °°

1214. Specifically with regard to Claimant’s reliance on the participation of the GOB in the

project, Mr. Rahman reiterated “the problems faced by other government agencies” and
“the dismal state of the land ownership record in Balochistan” as a result of which
Claimant “could have potentially been tied up in continuous litigation thereby impeding
any progress on the project for several years.”'>*! More generally, Mr. Rahman
emphasized that “government involvement cannot stop the public from raising objections
against the project or initiating legal proceedings against it in court.” Referring to
projects in rural areas which are part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and
supported by the GOP and Pakistan Army but “face numerous practical and legal issues,”
Mr. Rahman considers it “a fallacy to assume that government support ensures a quick

and smooth permitting and approval process.”

1215.At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Rahman again expressed the opinion that “land

acquisition is particularly challenging” and further that “TCC was not prepared for
it.”'533 He specified that he considered “[a]ny land acquisition in Pakistan, particularly
in Balochistan, ... challenging” and clarified that he was primarily referring to the slurry
pipeline because “it’s a huge land acquisition, and it’s not mentioned.”'*** Mr. Rahman
noted that “[t]he Permits Register does not identify land acquisition as something that

1216.Mr. Rahman highlighted the hearing of objections before the land acquisition collector
who “has to hear everybody” as well as the notice, which has to be made “to the interested
people whose land it is” and who are then invited to speak. According to Mr. Rahman,
the award “is often challenged before the courts,” which further “often grant injunctions
as to the acquisition during the pendency of the litigation.” He therefore expressed the
opinion that “[I]and acquisition is an extremely lengthy process in Pakistan, and land

litigation is very lengthy. So, these things can stall, or even scrap, projects.”!>3"

1217.Mr. Rahman noted that in the case of the pipeline, Claimant needed to acquire land in
multiple districts in each of which it would have to complete the entire process. Mr.
Rahman further referred to inefficient bureaucracy, manual measuring of the land, which
“[t]akes forever,” and the absence of land records which made it “hard to establish who
the land belongs to, who the affected Parties are who need to be compensated.” He further
testified that these parties, even if compensated, would “often rush to the civil court, and
... get an injunction, which stalls things for ages.” In his opinion, “it’s likely that there
will be litigation where there is land acquisition in Pakistan. It’s well-known, well-

documented that land-related litigation can last very many years.”'°*

1218. The Tribunal notes that even though Mr. Rahman testified at the Hearing on Quantum
that he considered “[a]ny land acquisition in Pakistan” challenging, both his expert
reports and presentation at the Hearing and the Parties’ submissions regarding land
acquisition were focused on the area needed for the slurry pipeline from Reko Dig to Port

Gwadar. In addition, and while Mr. Rahman explained his focus on the pipeline by
referring to it as “a huge land acquisition” and emphasizing that land acquisition for the
pipeline was not addressed in the Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study,
there has been no specific challenge by Respondent or Mr. Rahman that Claimant did not
have the necessary land rights over the mine site itself.

1219. As noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, it is established by the record that
Claimant had obtained a Surface Rights Lease over an area of 144,568 acres in February
2008 at an amount of 5,000 Pakistani rupees per acre, which covered the mine as well as
the additional infrastructure assets to be built on site. The Surface Rights Lease was
expressly granted “initially for a period of 30 years extendable for another period.”'>*
Respondent initially argued that “[t]here is no precedent for ‘surface rights’ as proposed
by TCC,” and that “while those rights may have some effect at that time, they would not
have held sufficient backing in the law to truly pass as anything more than a ‘quit claim’
deed of sorts, not actual ownership but a claim to ownership.”'** Claimant’s Surface
Rights Lease was not addressed by Mr. Rahman, however, and Respondent did not
provide any further detail or support for this argument in its subsequent submissions.
Against this background, the Tribunal has no basis to assume that the rights over the land
at the central mine facilities that Claimant had obtained through the Surface Rights Lease
would have given a buyer cause for concern.

1220. As for the land acquisition regarding the pipeline, it is undisputed between the Parties that
as of the valuation date, Claimant had not yet obtained or started the process of obtaining
land rights. There is further common ground that the Draft Permit Register appended to
the Feasibility Study did not make reference to the acquisition of land for the pipeline.'*+!

Claimant has pointed out, however, that it continued to update the Draft Permit Register

after delivery of the Feasibility Study and has submitted a version dated December

2011.15?

1221.The Tribunal notes that while the version appended to the Feasibility Study did not
include land acquisition as a separate item for any of the off-site facilities, the updated
version of December 2011 did contain an item “Land acquisition” and makes explicit
reference to the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 for the construction of: (i) the off-site
access road; (ii) certain early works site services; (iii) the water supply pipeline; (iv) plant
site-site preparation; (v) preliminary road construction to access the site and lay-down
area; and (vi) the supply and installation of water and sewer lines.'**? This version of the

Draft Permit Register does not contain the permits required for the slurry pipeline. It
further appears from a report on the Monthly Progress on Permitting Assignment for the
Reko Dig project also dated December 2011 that Claimant had not specifically added an
item on land acquisition to the permits required for the pipeline.'*“* However, even if
there was an omission at this point, it is apparent that Claimant was aware of the Land
Acquisition Act and its requirements for the acquisition of land for the off-site facilities.
The Register dated December 2011 also includes a note with regard to all items listed
above that “[a]/though the Act does not apply on private land if acquired directly from
the owner, however it is recommended to involve the Revenue Department to avoid any

unforseen complexities in future.” 4°

1222. As pointed out by Claimant, Chapter 3 of the Feasibility Study on Legal and Title further
provides a description regarding the right of a mineral right holder to use the lands and
states that pursuant to rule 23 of the 2002 BM Rules, “the right of licensee to enter and
occupy the land which comprises the exploration area is subject to the rights of the
surface holders and a mineral right holder would be required to either directly acquire
private owned land through negotiations with the owners, or in the case of Government
owned land to obtain the relevant Government’s permission to use the land.” It is further
noted that the rights of the surface holder are “protected either through Government
intervention in stopping operations or through the payment of compensation not only for
the land but for buildings, crops, etc.”'**° It is then stated:

“In many cases the use of surface rights is negotiated directly with the
landowners without intervention of the Government. However, in the case of
difficult land owners, the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act are often
invoked.

Under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the Provincial Government can
acquire land from private parties for ‘public purposes’ or for a company. A
landowner can object to the acquisition process, but the nature of the
objections that can be raised has not been specified. The Government is
required to determine compensation and this determination is subject to
challenge on the ground that the Government determination was not based
on market price. The decision of the Court does not affect the transfer of land
under the land acquisition proceedings, but renders the acquirer to pay the
compensation.” 47

and the requirement of a written and registered deed as valid title, the following is noted:

“TCCP has been granted surface rights by the Government of Balochistan
over 585.05 km? of land situated in Mouza Koh-Sultan, Tehsil Nok Kundi
District Chagai for a period of 30 years extendable for a further period.

TCCP has also been granted surface rights by the Board of Revenue,
Balochistan over 750.0 acres of land for construction of air strip for a period
of 30 years and surface rights over 9 333.3 acres in Tahlab area for
installation of tube wells and laying of pipelines.”'>**

1224.In Respondent’s view, Claimant thereby “simply provided a general overview of land
rights and the Land Acquisition Act with no plan for implementation.”'*° The Tribunal
agrees with Respondent to the extent that this chapter does not make reference to land
acquisition specifically for the slurry pipeline nor does it set out when Claimant planned
to acquire the land. However, it is clearly stated that in the event of “difficult land
owners,” Claimant would proceed under the Land Acquisition Act pursuant to which “the
Provincial Government can acquire land from private parties for ‘public purposes’ or for
a company.” The Tribunal also notes that Respondent did not specifically challenge the
statement in Chapter 3 that, while the landowner could object to the acquisition process,
it could not prevent the transfer of land but only challenge the compensation to be
determined by the Government: “The decision of the Court does not affect the transfer of
land under the land acquisition proceedings, but renders the acquirer to pay the

compensation.” °°

1225.Contrary to this statement, Mr. Rahman testified at the Hearing on Quantum that “courts
often grant injunctions as to the acquisition during the pendency of the litigation” and
that this could “stall, or even scrap, projects.” Mr. Rahman specifically stated that even
if compensation was paid to the land owners, “they often rush to the civil court, and ...,
get an injunction, which stalls things for ages.”'>>' However, the Tribunal also notes that
Mr. Rahman did not make any reference to injunctions in either of his expert reports. He
also did not provide any authority in support of his opinion, including in its Presentation
at the Hearing on Quantum, and did not state that any of the projects he described as being
“stalled” was subject to an injunction legally preventing the acquisition of land.

1226.By contrast, Claimant contends that “[i]t is well-settled Pakistani law that pending
litigation does not bar the alienation of immovable property rights” and refers to a
decision of the Karachi High Court in Ahsan Corporation v. Chairman, Evacuee Trust
Property Board in support of its position.'*? The Tribunal does not have to make a
finding whether Claimant’s reference to “well-settled Pakistani law” is accurate. In any

event, the Tribunal has not been pointed to any legal authority to the contrary or any
support for Mr. Rahman’s opinion that the land acquisition could be prevented or stalled
by pending litigation.

1227.Consequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that the information included by Claimant
in the Feasibility Study demonstrated an insufficient understanding of the land acquisition
process and/or specifically the impact of litigation on the act of acquiring the land in
Pakistan. While Mr. Rahman reiterated that he was personally involved in projects where
“two or three people have stalled a very large Project because of land acquisition,”!>>?
in neither of the examples he presented does the acquiring party appear to actually have
been legally prevented from acquiring the land. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that
Mr. Rahman’s references to the likelihood of there being litigation and what he
characterized as “massive, massive delays in litigation in Pakistan generally”!***

are not
sufficient to assume that litigation would have legally impacted Claimant’s ability to
proceed with the project.

1228.Mr. Rahman further pointed to certain particularities in Balochistan, such as the absence
of land records for considerable parts of the land and the existence of nomad tribes, which
would make it difficult to identify previous landowners who would be entitled to
compensation, as well as inefficient bureaucracy of Balochistan authorities. This general
description of the situation in Balochistan appears to be largely undisputed by Claimant
and the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and Mr. Rahman to the extent that it would
therefore be reasonable to expect certain delays also in the acquisition of land. However,
as pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Davis has already accounted for certain delays in his
valuation model and the question must therefore be whether any of the concerns raised
by Mr. Rahman would have given a buyer reason to expect longer delays than those
accounted for by Prof. Davis.

1229.In this regard, the Tribunal considers it important to recall that the Government of
Balochistan was not only a regulatory authority in this case but was rather Claimant’s
joint venture partner under the CHEJVA. Pursuant to Clause 7.2(a) of the CHEJVA, it
was to provide at it own expense, inter alia, “appropriate administrative support as
required for the obtaining of all leases, licences, claims, permits or other authorities of
any kind whatsoever being necessary for the conduct of Joint Venture Activities.”'>>>
Pursuant to Clause 5.7.2 of the CHEJVA, the GOB was further responsible for “liaising
with relevant Provincial Government and local government authorities and with affected
landholders to ensure that good relations are maintained between the Joint Venture and

other persons during the conduct of Joint Venture Activities.” '*°° More generally, Clause
24.6.2 of the CHEJVA provides that “[t]he Parties shall be just and faithful to one another
and will not do or omit to be done anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture
contemplated herein as a whole are prejudiced” and Clause 24.6.3 provides that “[e]ach
Party shall execute all necessary additional documents and do all such acts as shall be

reasonably required to give effect to the purposes of this Agreement.”'>>"

1230.In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal found that pursuant to these
provisions, the GOB was under an obligation to provide administrative support in
procuring the required licenses and permits and to perform all reasonable acts to give
effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture as a whole,
i.e., to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources at Reko Diq. The Tribunal
further noted that there was no dispute between the Parties that the GOB indeed provided
this support for, and thus facilitated, Claimant's investment over a period of many years,
inter alia, by defending the validity of the CHEJVA before the Balochistan High Court
in 2007.'*8 The same applies to the GOP, which also supported and facilitated Claimant’ s
investment, including by a submission to the Pakistan Supreme Court in 2010, which
concerned the same proceeding regarding the validity of the CHEJVA.!°° Based on its
analysis of the contractual framework as well as the regulatory framework and the
conduct of the GOB and the GOP during the period in which Claimant explored the area
at Reko Dig, the Tribunal concluded that Respondent had created the legitimate
expectation that: (i) Claimant would be entitled to a mining lease upon submission of an
application that met the routine requirements as set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM
Rules; and (ii) both the GOB and the GOP would support and facilitate Claimant's

investment.!5°

1231. While Mr. Rahman confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that he was aware of the GOB’s
contractual obligation to provide support for Claimant in obtaining permits, he noted that
“Ts]uch an ambitious project on this scale in Balochistan has never been contemplated”
and expressed the opinion that the Government’s support would not have sufficed to make
permitting “a smooth process.” He also testified that Balochistan is “particularly hostile
to foreign an Government projects” and that, therefore, “cooperation would not really
have been part of the picture for this Project and permitting, land acquisition.” In support
of his opinion, Mr. Rahman referred to the examples he had presented on stalled projects

as well as to “a lot of testimony [that] has been heard to that effect over here.”'*°!

1232.In terms of examples, Mr. Rahman pointed to two CPEC projects for a hydropower station
and a dam both of which he described as “stalled because of land acquisition issues” and
referred to “many examples of land projects stalled due to land acquisition in Pakistan”
included in his expert reports. He then specified that: (i) a “telecom giant” had “major
issues in acquiring land in Balochistan for its [broadcast] tower sites because of
inefficient bureaucracy; (ii) “another mining company has had major issues with the
Government of Balochistan because of land acquisition and people who are unhappy and
protesting”; (iii) an express motorway was “completely stalled because the Court
intervened and scrapped the Project because the land acquisition was not done in a
proper manner’, (iv) the Pakistan Navy’s acquisition of 13,500 acres was “brought into

question, intense protests.” °°

1233. The Tribunal is not convinced that most of these examples are sufficiently comparable to
the Reko Diq project when it comes to the impact that land acquisition for the pipeline
would have had on the communities. In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow the
argument that it can be concluded from protests against a hydropower station and a dam,
broadcast tower sites or an elevated express motorway in Lahore that there would be the
same level of protest against a pipeline buried in the ground.

1234.In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that while Mr. Rahman referred to “a huge land
acquisition” for the pipeline, he confirmed that he had “not done a precise calculation”

but only noted that “it’s a very lengthy pipeline.” He further confirmed that he was not
aware of the exact dimensions of the pipeline or that there would be an access road to
follow the path of the pipeline. When pointed to the width of the proposed pipeline (“a

203 mm (8 inch) outside diameter’)®

and of the contemplated access road (7
meters),!°™ Mr. Rahman maintained that “[iJt’s still a whole lot of land”! However, in
the absence of any inquiry into the amount of land to be acquired in the districts and thus
any assessment of the impact that the land acquisition would have had on the existing
land owners, the Tribunal again considers that this is not sufficient to establish that there

would likely have been significant protest against the land acquisition for the pipeline.

1235.Mr. Rahman was further pointed to the ESIA for the project, which states in the section
on the concentrate pipeline corridor and specifically the sub-section on physiography and
landscape that “[a]gricultural areas are generally localized near the Kech river crossing,

Buleda and Parom, although the size of the developments indicates these are mainly for
subsistence use and are unlikely to be directly affected by Project activities (Physical and
Cultural Baseline Study for Reko Dig Transport Corridors and Marine Terminal, HBP,
2010e). All other areas of the pipeline route are not considered suitable for cultivation
by local communities.”°° When asked whether the owners of the land close to the
pipeline, if they had sold some of their land, would see the value of their remaining land
increase, Mr. Rahman noted that this “depends on the whole situation over there
regarding the Market Value of the land, which is affected by a number of factors.” He
confirmed that some of the local community along the pipeline route were relatively
isolated; when asked whether the construction or expansion of a road along the pipeline
route would provide those communities with greater access, he testified that he “ha[d]n’t

really looked at this” as it was not part of his report.'°%7

1236.In the Tribunal’s view, the consideration raised by Claimant that it may have been an
incentive for the land owners to agree to the transfer of land in return for being provided
with access to a road connecting Reko Diq with Port Gwadar is supported by the fact that
one of the contemporaneous requests from the GOB was in fact that a road be built from
Reko Dig to Port Gwadar. For example, it is recorded in Claimant’s notes of a meeting
with Chief Secretary Lehri in March 2010 that when asked what “more” Balochistan was
asking to get from the project, Mr. Lehri stated that “[t]he politicians/population from
Makran are looking for a rode [sic] from Gwadar to Reko Dig; recently several Makran
representatives called on the CS asking what will happen with their road now that the
GOB wants to take the project over.” While Claimant pointed out that the Feasibility
Study identified the slurry pipeline as the least costly solution, Mr. Lehri responded that
“maybe so, but finding a way to build a road from Gwadar to Reko Dig is very

important.”'>8

1237.The Tribunal appreciates that the request from the GOB was presumably aimed at the
construction of a larger road than the contemplated access road for the pipeline. However,
in the Tribunal’s view, this confirms that access to infrastructure for communities along
the way from Reko Dig to Port Gwadar was indeed an issue at the time and indicated that
even the construction of an access road could have been viewed favorably by the affected
communities. In any event, the Tribunal also recalls that no concern was raised by the
GOB at the time that it might be difficult or a lengthy process to obtain the land required
for building a pipeline and/or an access road.

1238.Mr. Rahman also referred to land acquisition issues faced by the Duddar project, which
might be considered comparable to the extent that it was also a mining project and located

in Balochistan. Mr. Rahman referred to numerous complaints regarding the non-
completion of roads and bridges as well as the “non-settlement of land acquisition issues,”
specifically the relocation of a village for which compensation had been paid to the land
owners but the Government had not allocated alternative land as a result of which “the

locals were resisting the project causing costly work stoppages.” °°

1239. As pointed out to Mr. Rahman at the Hearing on Quantum, it is stated in the PSI Bankable
Feasibility Report for the pipeline that “[t]he final route was selected avoiding towns,
private farms, military installation and facilities, and away from the Iran border as much
as practically feasible.”!>” While Mr. Rahman maintained that “[t]his land was owned
by somebody, and, therefore, land acquisition would have needed to take place with all
the challenges it brings,”'*"' the Tribunal is not convinced that it would have to be
expected that Claimant would face a similar issue as described for the Duddar project,
taking into account that the pipeline route was intentionally designed to minimize
interference with populated areas. In particular, Respondent did not dispute Claimant’s
submission and supporting evidence that while there was a contemplated relocation of the
Siah Reg village, all inhabitants had agreed to the relocation and therefore no similar

issues would have to be expected.!*7?

1240.In any event, the Tribunal sees no indication in Mr. Rahman’s description of the issues
faced by the Duddar project that they prevented the company from acquiring the land or
proceeding to operating the mine without unreasonable delays. In addition, there is no
indication that in the case of the Duddar project, the GOB would also have been under a
contractual obligation to provide administrative support to the project and perform all
reasonable acts to give effect to the purpose and interests of the project.

1241.As for Mr. Rahman’s reference to a hostility in Balochistan towards projects of foreign
investors and the GOB in general and towards the Reko Diq project in particular, the
Tribunal notes that he apparently relied on the testimony of Respondent’s other witnesses
and experts. Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal does not consider it

The Tribunal notes that in Mr. Zandvliet’s trip report of April 2009, he makes reference to Siah Reg, stating that
“[lJand ownership issues are being dealt with at the moment.” However, as his further report makes clear, renewed
issues had arisen becase there was “a renewed discussion within TCC whether Siah Reg needs to be resettled at
all’ and he emphasized that it was “important to make this decision (preferably with support of an external
resettlement expert) and provide clarity to the Siah Reg people.” There is no indication in the report that the allor
some of the village inhabitants were no longer willing to relocate but Mr. Zandvliet identified “a risk that the stop-
and-go approach of the past two years will lead to fatigue among residents and may, in the future, lead to
additional demands.” Exhibit RE-644, p. 7. The Siah Reg settlement was not raised as an issue by Respondent
and the Tribunal does not consider that Mr. Zandvliet’s report would warrant a different conclusion as to whether
it was to be expected that the Siah Reg relocation would have caused significant delays with regard to the
acquisition of land.

established that there was significant general hostility towards the project which would
have significantly impacted Claimant’s ability to acquire the land rights it needed for the
project. In the Tribunal’s view, this is also confirmed by the fact that Claimant had already
acquired the Surface Rights Lease over the mine area without facing any such major
issues. In addition, and while the Tribunal does not wish to belittle the issues faced by
investors and also the Government in Balochistan with regard to insurgents and even
terrorist groups, it is also not convinced that these issues would have affected specifically
the acquisition of land in a manner that would have caused delays beyond those accounted
for by Prof. Davis.

1242. Mr. Rahman stated in his first report that he had been involved in pipeline projects “where
land acquisition has taken as long as 18 months” and expressed the opinion that it would
have taken “considerably longer’ for the slurry pipeline “since this was a private party
acquiring land, which involves extra difficulties, and the land acquisition was in
Balochistan with all the challenges facing projects in the said province.”'>7? However, as
it would not have been a private party acquiring the land but rather the GOB in accordance
with its contractual obligations under the CHEJVA and having considered the particular
challenges for a project in Balochistan that Respondent and Mr. Rahman identified, the
Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Rahman’s opinion that it would have taken
“considerably longer” than the “as long as 18 months” he had experienced in other
projects to acquire the land for the pipeline.

1243.Finally, as to the timing of starting with the permitting and land acquisition process for
the pipeline, Respondent itself pointed out at the Hearing on Quantum!>”* that Mr.
Livesey testified already at the Hearing on Jurisdiction on Liability that “as the pipeline
construction was only going to be late in the entire construction period of the project, the
permitting would only start when the construction on the rest of the project started. We
had about a two year window in which to get all the permits up to speed.”'>7> Mr. Livesey
also testified that “the proposal was that we would not start to acquire the land until after
the Mining Lease had been granted. Obviously we wouldn’t want to commit capital into
surface rights leases until we had security of tenure on the mine. And we put in a program

at that stage to look at the right of ways and the leeways for the pipeline.”'>"

1244. The Tribunal finds this testimony plausible and concludes that there is no basis to assume
that this timing, together with the delays modeled by Prof. Davis, which will be addressed
in more detail below, would have been considered insufficient by a buyer as of the
valuation date.

ii. Whether Claimant Failed to Identify Relevant Permits and Approvals

1245. As noted above, Respondent did not identify a specific permit or approval that Claimant
should have, but had not, already obtained at the valuation date. However, Respondent
claims that Claimant “did not even know all of the permits it needed, did not appreciate
the practical difficulties of operating in Balochistan and failed to account for the specific

difficulties of getting permits for the project.”'°"

1246. Respondent argues that Mr. Rahman has identified several permits in his first report that
were not included in Claimant’s Draft Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study.
While Claimant takes the position that some of these permits would not be required, it
does not allege that the Draft Permit Register was complete or final. It rather refers to the
Chapter on Permitting and Approvals in the Feasibility Study, which states in the section
on the Permit and Obligation Register:

“The permit register is considered to be a ‘live working document” that is
subject to continuous revision as the project proceeds through the FS,
detailed design, procurement, construction management and operational
Phases. During the FS phase of the IMD project, a revised permit list and
permit registry has been developed (see Appendix 22.05).

As indicated at the start of Section 12.1, although the full obligations register
has not been completed, the requirements to be incorporated are understood.
The obligations register will continue to be developed and updated during the
project, incorporating information obtained from a number of sources,
including information obtained through the ESIA and conditions of
approvals, TCC’s community relations team, TCC’s legal counsel and any
preliminary discussions with possible lenders.”'>78

1247.Section 12.1 as referenced in the extract above provides at its beginning that “[a]//
regulatory requirements for the project have been identified in the Permit Register which
was prepared by Hagler Bailly on behalf of TCC (Section 12.2).”'>”

1248. In the section on Legal Requirements, it is further stated that “the focus to date has been
on environmental and water supply related permissions. Other legislation that may affect
the project is also being reviewed, with a preliminary list of permits discussed in Section
12.2.1.”!°® Section 12.2.1 on the Current Status of Permitting in Pakistan provides:

“At present, there are a number of permissions which have already been
granted to the Reko Dig project, as identified in the Permit Register (Section
12.3.1). These include the approved Tanjeel EIA, permissions relating to the

“No Objection Certificates’ issued to TCC to enable water exploration, access
to potential port areas ete.

From an environmental perspective, the ESIA process is proceeding with the
preparation of a detailed impact assessment report that expands on the initial
assessment undertaken for Tanjeel. It will be submitted to the authorities
when complete (Section 12.3.3). At this stage, no other submissions or permits
are required from an environmental perspective. In addition to the
environmental permits, there may need to be a number of submissions and

bseq permits obtained in terms of i | legislation. These
generally relate to building and equipment approvals and are identified in
the permit register.”'*!

 

1249. Section 12.2.1 then lists the water permits issued to date, which will be discussed in more
detail below.

1250.In a subsequent section on the Approvals plan, it is noted that “[a] project approvals plan
is being developed. The details of the plan are captured in a draft permit register which
is presented in Appendix 22.05, which forms part of the overall project’s obligation

register.”18?

1251.In the Tribunal’s view, it is made clear at various points of the Chapter that the Draft
Permit Register appended to the Feasibility Study was not yet final and complete. It was
also made clear that the focus had so far been on environmental and water supply
regulatory requirements, which are addressed in detail in the Chapter, and that the work
on permitting and approvals would continue after the finalization of the Feasibility Study.
That this was in fact the case is confirmed by the updated version of the Draft Permit
Register dated December 2011 as well as the reports on the Monthly Progress on
Permitting Assignment for the Reko Dig Project, which were continued to be prepared
until December 2011, i.e., shortly after the Mining Lease Application was denied. In the
Tribunal’s view, it is therefore clear that a buyer would have looked at the updated Draft
Permit Register as of the valuation date in order to determine whether Claimant had a
reasonable plan and schedule for obtaining the relevant permits for the project.

1252.Neither Respondent nor Mr. Rahman addressed the updated version of the Draft Permit
Register or the monthly progress reports both of which were submitted together with
Claimant’s Reply on Quantum. Mr. Rahman continued to refer to the Draft Permit
Register appended to the Feasibility Study in his presentation at the Hearing on

Quantum.'*** Similarly, Respondent continued to point to the allegedly missing permits

in Appendix 22.05 in its Post-Hearing Brief. '***

1253. Specifically with regard to Respondent’s allegation that Claimant “had failed to address
in its Permit Register ... acquisition of the necessary water rights to ensure viability of
the project,” '>* the Tribunal notes that the Draft Permit Register specifically identified a
“Permit for Water Supply Wells, and water supply pipeline” (as well as two other permits
for potable water treatment and sewage treatment) and provided additional information
on the relevat legislation, competent agencies, required submission and procedure,
estimated approval time and further comments. In addition, the Chapter on Permitting
and Approvals provided further detail on the applicable water legislation and summarized
the implications for the project as follows:

* water law for industrial abstraction is currently absent; however, the
Balochistan Ground Water Rights Administration Ordinance (1978)
theoretically applies, and it is through this Ordinance that the water
supply NOCs were issued;

* — there is no consistent application of the Ordinance by the Provincial
Water Board and District Water Committees leading to uncertainty on
likely conditions of approval, or even if formal approval for abstraction
is necessary;

¢ the District Water Committees may comprise local tribal leaders with a
political agenda putting a consistent and transparent approval process
at risk;

* new water policies and regulations are proposed indicating that the
future of water law in Pakistan could be significantly different to that
currently in place, putting any existing water rights at risk (particularly
if the long term sustainability of water resources is perceived to be at
risk); and

* water charges for abstraction are being considered and could result in
additional costs for the project that are not currently accounted for.”'>*6

1254. Making reference to “the challenges facing confirmation of water rights,” in particular
that “the process may not have been appropriately followed and it is not clear if the

issuing authorities have been appropriately established,” each of the six water permits

issued to date was listed and assessed as to its scope.'*87

1255.As pointed out by Respondent, the risk register of the Feasibility Study specifically
included the risk of “Draw down of water by others leaves insufficient water for project
needs — caused by the current legislation not explicitly protecting the rights to use water
(quantity and duration) results in the need to develop alternative sources.” In terms of its
risk mitigation strategy, Claimant had identified that protection of water rights should be
included in the Mineral Agreement and support should be obtained from the GOB after
restructuring of the shareholders agreement. Based on the consideration that the issue was
addressed in the current draft of the Mineral Agreement, the OPEX impact assigned to

this risk was reduced to USD 2 million (from USD 19.9 million without mitigation).!°**

1256. Based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent that
Claimant failed to address the acquisition of necessary water rights. To the contrary,
Claimant had analyzed the legislation and had specifically identified the risk that due to
the absence of a law on industrial abstraction of water, there might be interference by
other users. Claimant also noted that there might be future legislation putting existing
water rights at risk and providing for water charges which were not accounted for in the
current cost estimate.

1257.Claimant had further planned on mitigating the first risk by including a protection of its
water rights in the Mineral Agreement. Respondent argues that Claimant thereby
“planned to mitigate this risk with another risk, which ranked even higher on the impact
scale, and was not likely to materialize (the parties not reaching a mineral
agreement.”*®° As pointed out by Respondent, the risk of “Inability to negotiate Mineral
Agreement” was ranked “High” in the Draft Permit Register.'*°? However, the Tribunal
has already found above that the high risk rating assigned by Claimant to that particular
risk at the time it delivered the Feasibility Study to the GOB was based on the actual
situation in which negotiations had stalled due to the GOB’s decision not to go ahead with
them. The Tribunal further found that, if the GOB had not decided to take over the project
from Claimant, it would have continued to negotiate with Claimant and an agreement
would likely have been reached between the negotiating parties, including the GOB. On
that basis, the Tribunal also considers it reasonable that Claimant assigned a lower risk
rating and a lower OPEX impact to the risk of insufficient water due to interference by
other water users based on the assumption that the protection of its water rights would be
addressed in the Mineral Agreement.

1258.The Tribunal notes that in its Chapter on Permitting and Approvals, Claimant also made
reference to proposed new water policies and regulations which might put existing water
rights at risk and/or result in water charges for abstraction, which were not yet considered

in the cost estimate. However, as neither Respondent nor Mr. Rahman have addressed the
topic of future legislation or contemplated any water charges, the Tribunal sees no basis
to assume that Claimant failed to fully account for the risks associated with these aspects.

1259. Respondent further refers specifically to one of the No-Objection Certificates issued for

one of the alternative water sources and emphasizes that this Certificate limited the
number of tubewells to “two at the moment” and therefore covered only the exploratory
phase of the project.!°°! However, while the Tribunal found above that Claimant’s experts
could not exclude that Claimant might have to resort to alternative water sources at some
point, it had chosen the Fan Sediments as its primary water source to be developed for
the initial mine development scenario considered in the Feasibility Study. Consequently,
it appears reasonable to the Tribunal that, as confirmed by Mr. Mayer in his first expert

t,!5° Claimant retained its NOCs for the alternative sources which it had indeed

report
obtained for exploratory purposes but had not yet applied for further water extraction

rights with regard to these alternative sources.

1260. Respondent has not specifically challenged Claimant’s submission that it had obtained all

necessary authorizations for the extraction of water from the Fan Sediments.!5%* Rather,
it places emphasis on the absence of “exclusive” water extraction rights as well as the
discretion of the relevant authorities to impose conditions on, suspend or even cancel
water permits.!°*4 In the Tribunal’s view, however, these aspects were addressed by
Claimant by aiming to include a provision protecting its water rights in the Mineral
Agreement. There is also no indication in the contemporaneous discussions with the
Governments that water rights were a point of debate in the Mineral Agreement
negotiations. Finally, the Tribunal also recalls the GOB’s contractual obligation to
provide support in obtaining the relevant permits as well as its own participation in the
project as a result of which it would have been in the GOB’s own interest to ensure that
the necessary water permits were obtained and maintained.

1261.As a further matter, Respondent takes the position that Claimant “had little grasp of the

issues related to Port Gwadar,” with reports on the challenges faced by the existing
operator China’s interest to take over the port, and further claims that Claimant’s “section
of the Permits Register dealing with Gwadar is largely blank” because it failed to identify
any details regarding the permits it had identified. !*°>

1262.In response, Claimant referred to the fact that a site-selection trade-off study was
conducted which assessed four potential marine terminal sites in the Gwadar area and
identified Port Gwadar as the most suitable port site for the project.!°°° Claimant also
pointed to Mr. Livesey’s testimony during the liability phase that “TCC’s preliminary
inquiries into the leasing of land at port sites were met favorably and gave no indication
that there would be issues in leasing land packages to accommodate the pipeline’s
construction.”'°?7 Mr. Livesey also testified at the Hearing on Quantum that the team had
met with Port Gwadar officials and discussed, inter alia, the disposal facility for the
sludge generated by the water treatment. He confirmed that the disposal would require a

permit but did not know whether it was included in the permit register.'°°*

1263. While Respondent continues to assert that Claimant had not identified the need for its

“secret sludge dump,”'>*?

the Tribunal notes the Draft Permit Register did include an item
“Permits for construction of run-off-waste collection and treatment facilities, fire
protection, water supply, and sewage services required from the Balochistan Coastal
Development Authority.”'©° Consequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimant
had failed to identify this permit. In addition, and while the Draft Permit Register
appended to the Feasibility Study indeed did not contain any further information on this
and three other permits identified for the port facilities, these permits formed part of the
areas on which the Permits team focused in December 2011.'%! Respondent does not
allege that Claimant would have had to apply for these permits before being granted the
Mining Lease and it does not provide any argument as to why it would not have been
sufficient to address these permits in December 2011 as Claimant contemplated to do.

1264.As for Respondent’s more general argument regarding uncertainties surrounding Port
Gwadar and its operator in 2011, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has failed to identify
any measure that Claimant should have taken to address this uncertainty or any specific
risk that Claimant should have accounted for in addition to those regarding security which
have already been addressed above. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider it
necessary to address this assertion in any further detail.

1265. Finally, as for the remaining permits that Respondent claims to have identified as missing
in Claimant’s Draft Permit Register, the Tribunal recalls that as discussed in detail in the
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the GOB was under a contractual obligation to
provide administrative support to Claimant in procuring the required licenses and permits
for the project. Consequently, even if Claimant had failed to identify a certain permit or

approval, it could expect that the GOB would draw its attention to such an omission and
assist it in obtaining the required permit or approval if and when required.

1266.In conclusion, the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that Claimant failed to identify
relevant permits or approvals that it required in order to commence construction or mining
operations. The Tribunal further has no reason to believe that a buyer would have
expected Claimant to have obtained or applied for any additional permits or approvals as
of the valuation date.

iii Whether Claimant Had a Reasonable Plan and Schedule for Obtaining
the Required Permits and Approvals

1267.Respondent further argues that Claimant “the process of getting the permits and
approvals necessary to build a large project in Pakistan is no easy task.” '©°? Mr. Rahman
expressed the opinion in his first report that “[t]he permitting process can be long and
difficult, and the results are hard to predict. Based on the process of public input and
poor relations that TCC had with local communities, it is unlikely that the process of
getting permits would have proceeded smoothly. These difficulties would have caused any
investor substantial concerns if it had wanted to buy the Reko Dig project from TCC.”

1268. Claimant in turn considers that Respondent “has not shown that these alleged difficulties
would have been insurmountable, that they would have deterred potential investors from
investing in the Project, or that they would have materially affected the Project’s viability
or fair market value.” In Claimant’s view, the Reko Diq project did not face “any greater
permitting-related risks than would be expected in connection with any large-scale
mining project.” It further points to Prof. Davis’ model which, in Claimant’s view,

“already properly accounts for unmonetized risks associated with permitting.”'©*

1269.Consequently, the question for the Tribunal to address is not whether the permitting
process would have run “smoothly” but rather whether the delays accounted for by Prof.
Davis would have been considered insufficient by a buyer to account for the risks
associated with the permitting process.

1270.Claimant’s risk register identified the risk of “Failure to secure all required permits in
good time resulting in project delay” but did not assign a CAPEX or OPEX impact to this
risk.!©> Prof. Davis classified this risk in his valuation as a risk that could cause project
start-up delay.'°° He explained that he incorporated “negative events related to
permitting, financing, and negotiating a mineral agreement” into his model by “adding

time between the Valuation Date and the start of construction (initial project delay).”
Based on information about “the time between completion of the feasibility study and start
of construction for open pit mines among the largest 100 copper mines in the world by in
situ reserves and resources,” which in his opinion face similar issues with regard to these
particular risks, he came up with an average of 4.4 years (if pre-construction projects for
which only estimates are available are excluded) or 5.4 years (if pre-construction

estimates are included); the median duration is 4 years. '607

1271.Taking into account that Claimant had expected to start construction within 1.5 years after
obtaining the mining lease, which implied three years between the Feasibility Study and
construction start, Prof. Davis considered that this “put Reko Dig in the range of actual
experience at most other projects in [his] database.” Based on the data from these other
projects, he then assumed that “delay is a random draw from a Poisson distribution with
a mean of 4 years,” with a minimum level of 3 years as estimated by Claimant and an
additional six months duration to account for the fact that the DCF model runs annually.
On that basis, the mean would increase to approximately 5.3 years, which means that
“construction would start no sooner than two years after the Valuation Date, and that on
average it would take 3.8 years from the Valuation Date to reach start of

construction.” 8

1272. In his second report, Prof. Davis pointed out that his assumption amounted to “an average
delay of over two years relative to management’s projected construction start date,” with
a minimum delay of 6 months and up to a maximum delay of 13.5 years. He further stated
that “removing delay from the model and starting construction two years after the
Valuation Date in each simulation” would have increased the value by over USD 1.3
billion. !6

1273.Respondent addresses Prof. Davis’ modeling of these delays only in its Post-Hearing
Brief, noting that the model “does not allow one to zoom in to understand how exactly
this delay was applied to TCC’s valuation” and arguing that the mines on whose data he
based his assumption “are located in jurisdictions that are in low threat environments or
have highly developed mining industries and infrastructure, such as Chile.” In
Respondent’s view, the data is therefore “not sufficiently representative for calculating
the expected delays that may occur in an environment such as Balochistan.” Respondent
refers in particular to the “unique challenges of large infrastructure projects in
Balochistan” and the absence of “real-life examples in Pakistan to factor the permitting

uncertainty and risk TCC would likely face.” Respondent also relied on “the delays TCC

had already faced” when “the PSI team lost almost half of the planned days of fieldwork

due to permitting issues.”'6!°

1274.Respondent’s expert Mr. Rahman did not express an opinion as to whether the delays

modeled by Prof. Davis would adequately account for the permitting delays that he
considered likely to occur. Mr. Rahman also did not provide an estimate as to how long
it would have taken in his opinion to obtain the required permits and land rights he had
identified in his report. In his second report, he only reiterated that “the permitting process
would have been a significantly difficult task, one potentially riddled with a multitude of
problems arising out of, inter alia, potential litigation, difficulties with land acquisition,
an insufficiently resourced and understaffed bureaucracy, poor law and order situation
and several laws that allow for the local populace (which has been hostile to foreign and
national projects in the area, including Reko Dig) to raise objections.”'®'! Specifically in
response to Claimant’s argument that there was no evidence that the Reko Diq project
would have faced greater permitting-related risks than other large-scale mining projects,
Mr. Rahman expressed the opinion:

“There is a false equivalency that the Reply Memorial seeks to make between

any large-scale mining project and one such as the Reko Dig project, which

is located in one of the most remote, unstable and politically volatile regions

in Pakistan. The Reko Dig area and the Province of Balochistan in general is

unfortunately a host to various problems highlighted in the Expert Report that

are unique to the region. To compare the Reko Dig project with a large-scale

mining project in rural United States (for example) does not make sense. Most

rural mining projects do not involve constructing and maintaining an

extremely lengthy slurry pipeline through large tracts of land that face

constant water shortages, have little or no ownership records and belong to

hostile local populations. The threat of terrorism in the region is likewise

unique to the Reko Dig project. This plethora of problems would have been

injurious to the future viability of the Reko Dig project. Accordingly, these

problems would have consequently been a significant deterrence for any

reasonable investor.”'°!?

1275. While the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Rahman that a large-scale project in Balochistan
would likely face different risks or a different degree of risk than a project in the United
States, it must be noted that the projects on which Prof. Davis based his data are not only
located in the United States but include projects located in Chile, Mongolia, Russia,
Mexico, Panama, Peru, Democratic Republic of Congo, China, Philippines, Argentina,
Afghanistan, Ecuador, Fiji, Zambia, Brazil, Canada, Iran, Kazakhstan, Poland, and
Burma (Myanmar). The Tribunal also does not agree with Respondent that all of these

projects could be considered as being located in a low threat environment. As pointed out
by Claimant, five of these countries ranked lower than Pakistan in the 2010 index of the
ranking for ease of doing business on which Respondent and Mr. Rahman had relied.'°!?

1276.In addition, and while Mr. Rahman criticized Claimant for not presenting “evidence
refuting the findings of [his] Expert Report by showing examples of similar major projects
in the Balochistan area that were able to acquire and hold onto the permits without any
substantial difficulties,’'°'4 Mr. Rahman himself stated at the Hearing on Quantum that
“[s]uch an ambitious project on this scale in Balochistan has never been
contemplated.”'°'> The latter statement can be considered undisputed between the Parties
not only for Balochistan but also for other provinces of Pakistan. Consequently, Prof.
Davis could not have taken into account other large mining projects in Pakistan in his
dataset. Respondent also did not provide any data for other infrastructure projects which

it would have considered more representatives of the “unique challenges of large
infrastructure projects” faced by Reko Dig. In addition, as pointed out by Claimant,
Respondent has also not made any submissions on permitting issues faced by other,
smaller-scale mining projects in Balochistan, such as the Duddar and Saindak projects

and has not produced any documents to Claimant in this regard.

1277.In addition, taking note of the emphasis placed by Respondent and Mr. Rahman on the
security situation in Balochistan, the Tribunal recalls that it has already addressed in detail
above the security risks faced by the project and the adjustments to the value of
Claimant’s investment that need to be made to account for these risks. The Tribunal sees
no justification for further adjustments with regard to security-related risks in the present
context.

1278.As for the inefficiencies of bureaucracy referred to by Mr. Rahman, the Tribunal is not
convinced that these would be unique for Balochistan and would therefore not be
accounted for in the delays faced by at least some of the other projects in Prof. Davis’
dataset. In this regard, the Tribunal also again recalls the GOB’s contractual obligation to
provide administrative support in procuring the required permits and approvals. While
Mr. Rahman emphasized his opinion that “it is a fallacy to assume that government
support ensures a quick and smooth permitting and approval process,” the Tribunal notes
that Prof. Davis did not assume a “quick and smooth” process but rather that construction
would, on average, start two year later than provided in Claimant’s schedule and, in
absolute terms, 3.8 years after the Mining Lease would have been granted in the but-for
scenario. In the Tribunal’s view, neither Respondent nor Mr. Rahman have provided the

Tribunal with a convincing argument as to why this average delay would have been
considered insufficient by a buyer in the present circumstances.

1279. As a final matter, the Tribunal notes that at the Hearing on Quantum and again in its Post-
Hearing Brief on Quantum, Respondent referred to “permitting issues” of the project in

the past,!0!®

always pointing to an issue regarding a No-Objection Certificate faced by the
PSI team when making its field trip along the pipeline route in August / September 2009.
However, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would serve as evidence of major
permitting issues faced by the project at the feasibility stage. The issue concerned an
expired NOC for PSI’s Construction Manager, which was raised on 29 August 2009. Mr.
Mayer, who was contacted by the PSI team, requested the team to return to the hotel to
put a scope and schedule together for what was left to complete in the field. The team
spent the next day at the hotel awaiting the NOC but carried out further work on the
following day without the Construction Manager. Following another day awaiting the
extension of the NOC, the Certificate was extended on 2 September 2009 and the full
team continued its field trip.'°!7 Respondent did not point to any further permitting issue
at the feasibility stage or prior stages of the project.

1280. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the absence of major permitting issues
in the past may not be sufficient evidence in and of itself to demonstrate that the project
would also not face permitting issues in the future, the absence of any such issues does
show that the GOB acted in accordance with its contractual obligations in the past and
was able to support and facilitate the project. As the Tribunal found in the Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability, the GOB and also the GOP also created a legitimate expectation
that they would continue to support and facilitate Claimant’s investment. While this does
not guarantee that Claimant would not have faced any permitting issues in the future, the
Tribunal considers that the legitimate expectation for continued support by both
Governments confirms the Tribunal’s conclusion that the delays modeled by Prof. Davis
in his valuation would have been considered sufficient by a buyer as of the valuation date.

9. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Could Have Obtained the Necessary
Funding for the Project

a. Summary of Claimant’s Position

1281.Claimant submits that in the absence of Respondent’s breaches, the Reko Diq project
would have attracted the necessary financing, as it had the full support of its sponsors,

Antofagasta and Barrick. As the Tribunal found in its Decision on Jurisdiction and
Liability, “two of the world’s largest mining companies ... were willing to contribute

large amounts of equity to the project.”!6'8

1282.In Claimant’s view, the Tribunal already rejected “substantially identical financing
arguments,” holding that Claimant had or could obtain the financial resources to carry
out mining operations at Reko Diq and that the information provided in the Feasibility
Study satisfied the requirement under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, and
Respondent failed to provide any evidence to undermine the Tribunal’s previous
conclusions.'*!° Specifically, Claimant considers the Tribunal’s previous conclusions
confirmed by Antofagasta’s chairman Mr. Luksic, Antofagasta’s executive Mr.
Septilveda, and Claimant’s expert on financing, Mr. Pingle, and maintains that it would
have been “premature to engage in detailed financing decisions” before obtaining the
mining lease. Claimant refers to Mr. Pingle’s explanation that “it made no sense for TCCA
or its Sponsors to engage directly and in detail with Lenders before obtaining the mining

lease.?1©29

1283.Claimant also rebuts five arguments advanced by Respondent as to why the question
before the Tribunal would be different from the question decided in the liability phase:
(i) Respondent fails to justify why the burden of proof should be any different from the
liability phase and, in any event, the Tribunl did not rely on the burden of proof; (ii) the
argument that “nothing on the record indicates that ... financing was available” was
already rejected by the Tribunal, which considered the requirement that Respondent was
trying to impose on Claimant to be not realistic given Mr. Luksic’s confirmation of the
statement in the Feasibility Study that it would be premature to have more than general
discussions on financing before the project is approved and its financial requirements are
determined; (iii) the Tribunal already considered the absence of a Mineral Agreement
which “would have made such financing more challenging” but there was “no indication
that it would have been impossible”; (iv) the Tribunal did not find that Claimant’s owners
would have provided full equity financing but rather that Claimant would successfully
have arranged third-party financing; and (v) Respondent itself chose not to adduce expert

evidence on the ability to finance the project in the liability phase.'*!

1284.Specifically with regard to Respondent’s argument that the absence of a Mineral
Agreement and thus a negotiated fiscal regime was “a key flaw,” Claimant also refers to
Mr. Pingle who noted that he had “rarely seen a Fiscal Stability Agreement ‘pre-agreed,’
particularly in jurisdictions unused to large scale investments in projects. Usually, these
agreements are among the last items agreed” and “[mlost often, these documents are
agreed at the request and insistence of the ECAs and/or the DFIs.” Consequently,
Claimant argues that the absence of a Mineral Agreement would not have prevented
financing, but the arrangement of financing by ECAs and DFIs would rather have
facilitated the conclusion of the Mineral Agreement.'

1285.In any event, Claimant relies on Mr. Pingle’s experience in limited recourse project

finance to argue that the project was “eminently financeable” and that it would have

secured financing if Respondent had complied with its obligations under the Treaty.!°?
Claimant emphasizes that, contrary to what Respondent’s experts suggested in their first
report, it does not have to show that it would have actually sold the project to an actual
specific buyer in November 2011, given that in the absence of Respondent’s breaches, it
would have financed the project and would therefore not have sold it. In this regard,
Claimant refers to Mr. Luksic’s testimony that they “wanted to be the ones to build [the
mine]” and that his conversations with Barrick “confirmed that they felt the same way’;
he stated unequivocally: “We were simply not in the market to sell; we were in the market
to build.”'®*+ Claimant considers this testimony unchallenged and confirmed by Mr.
Pingle’s statement that “[m]ajor mining projects like this, I’ve never been involved in one
that got sold. They get completed and they get financed, but they don’t get sold.”!°*>

1286. Claimant argues that in order to determine the fair market value of Claimant’s investment,
it also does not have to show that it would in fact have financed the project after the
valuation date but rather that the project could have been financed, i.e., that it was
financeable. Claimant claims that, in light of the Tribunal’s previous findings, “there can

be no reasonable dispute that TCC could have financed the project.” !©*°

1287. According to Claimant, Respondent presented an “entirely new” argument in its Closing
Presentation, suggesting that the “[i]mpact of the uncertainty on financing” is that value
must go down. Claimant considers this argument irrelevant, arguing that “Prof. Davis
addressed any uncertainty about the precise nature of financing from third parties by

conservatively assuming all equity financing from TCC’s owners.”!°’ In addition,
Claimant argues that any uncertainty is the result of Respondent’s Treaty breaches and
maintains that, as Mr. Pingle testified, there was “no doubt that, with the mining lease,
Reko Dig would have certainly attracted the required financing” because “Reko Dig had
experienced Sponsors making a significant equity investment. They had a world-class
comprehensive Feasibility Study that was prepared under the supervision of SNC-
Lavalin. They [had] attractive economics in a very conservative case, and it had numerous

financing options.”

1288. As for the alleged “fatal flaws” detected by Respondent, Claimant rejects each of them as
“baseless” but maintains that even if they were not baseless, market practice shows that
“Sponsors and Lenders would have worked together to solve any issue, if there was any
issue at all.” Claimant refers to Mr. Pingle who described the process of lenders’ review
in mining projects undertaken by major mining companies as “cooperative” and giving
the Sponsors “the benefit of the doubt’ and who noted that he had never seen a project in
which the sponsors committed 60% of the project costs but then failed to secure financing

for technical reasons. '©?

1289. Claimant also rejects the argument that it adhered to an outdated standard provided in the
CHEJVA, emphasizing that the CHEJVA does not dictate any standard to which the work
was to be performed and adding that, in any event, its feasibility work was performed “in
accordance with the highest contemporaneous industry standards, and indeed set anew

bar for Barrick’s later feasibility work at other mines.”'®°

1290.Claimant considers that the first report of Respondent’s experts Mr. Henry and Mr.
Howden contained “a hodgepodge of assertions on a range of topics” and asserted
without any supporting evidence that there was no capacity in the market to finance Reko
Diq in 2011 because the Oyu Tolgoi mining project in Mongolia had sucked up all
available financing. According to Claimant, Mr. Pingle demonstrated, however, that there
was “ample capacity—hundreds of billions of dollars—in the market in 2011,” which was
only confirmed by the Oyu Tolgoi project.'©! Specifically, Claimant refers to various
contemporaneous statements and statistics about major ECAs as well DFIs, which in its
view confirm that these agencies were not capacity constrained, in particular when taking
into account that the drawdown schedule of mining projects is dictated by the construction

schedule and the required debt financing must thus be broken down by year of
construction. '®? In Claimant’s view, Mr. Henry and Mr. Howden then abandoned their
capacity argument, conceding that “[t]here is no denying [the relevant lenders] are well
funded institutions in their own right,” but instead raising a new argument that “mining
finance transactions are always arranged by a group of commercial lenders acting as

Mandated Lead Arrangers.”'°*

1291.Claimant claims that Mr. Howden admitted at the Hearing on Quantum that “he had
simply assumed the case away” by clarifying that his opinion referred to the financeability
of the project as it existed “in its current form” on the valuation date, including the
assumption that Claimant “did not have a mining lease” and that the critiques made by
Respondent’s experts were well-founded. In Claimant’s view, the expert reports of Mr.

Henry and Mr. Howden can therefore be given no evidentiary weight.'°**

1292. Claimant again refers to Mr. Pingle who testified that “the most important single issue in
a project is the Sponsors, their capability, their experience, and the amount of money they
are committing.” Claimant emphasizes that the Sponsors were contemplating an equity
contribution of 60% of the total project costs, which Mr. Pingle described as “an
extremely high contemplated equity investment,’ demonstrating a “high level of
confidence in the Project,” and which Mr. Howden acknowledged to be a “significant

equity investment” and “relevant to a lending decision.”!°*

1293. According to Claimant, the project had the full support of its sponsors, as confirmed by
Mr. Luksic’s testimony as well as the fact they they had invested hundreds of millions of
US dollars in the Feasibility Study and were willing to contribute 60% of the project costs.
Claimant quotes from Mr. Pingle who stated that lenders “would have given great weight
not only to the sponsors’ financial capacity but also to their managerial, technical, and
operating expertise.”'%°

1294.Claimant further contends that Reko Diq would have had numerous options for debt
financing of the remaining 40% of project costs, referring to a combination of Export
Credit Agencies (ECAs), Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), Islamic Banks and

government-supported funds as presented by Mr. Pingle at the Hearing on Quantum.!°*7

Claimant also notes that the Feasibility Study contemplated that “the anchor of the

financing plan will be the multilateral agencies and export credit agencies (ECAs).”'©*

1295. According to Claimant, ECAs alone could have financed the entire debt portion of the
financing, relying on Mr. Pingle’s testimony that “[t]ypically 60 percent of a large mining
project’s Project Costs are eligible for ECA financing.”'®° According to Claimant, there
would thus have been little uncertainty as to the lenders as well as to the terms of their
lending given that ECA financing must comply with the standardized OECD
Arrangement of Officially Supported Export Credits.'° Claimant further notes that Mr.
Henry and Mr. Howden stated in their second report that ECAs can finance up to 85% of
an export contract, implying that commercial lenders would have to fund the remaining
15% of the debt, but Mr. Howden acknowledged at the Hearing on Quantum that the 15%

down payment can be made with equity.!!

1296.Claimant submits that, “[t]hough not strictly needed,” DFIs such as the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the German KfW
“would have provided additional funding, mitigated risks, and potentially structured and
syndicated the transaction.” In Claimant’s view, Reko Diq clearly “fit the DFIs’
mandate” as the IFC stated in its 2012 annual report that “JFC’s mission in the oil, gas,
and mining sector is to help developing countries realize these benefits.” Claimant also
refers to Mr. Pingle’s explanation that “[e]ach of these insitutions supports Pakistan, and

is open for business and has a long history there.”'°?

1297. Specifically, with regard to the argument raised by Respondent that ECAs and DFIs
would have been reluctant to lend in “frontier” markets such as Pakistan, Claimant
submits that the distinction between “frontier” and “emerging” markets is primarily used
in equity financing but has “little relevance in limited recourse project financing.”
According to Claimant, ECAs focus on developing their country’s experts and DFIs on
promoting private sector development regardless of whether the project is in a “frontier”
market, which can even strengthen the case for financing it given the IFC’s explanation
in its 2012 Annual Report that “‘strengthening the focus on frontier markets” was one of

its “strategic focus areas.”'*? In any event, Claimant describes the definition of
“frontier” markets as “blurry” and notes that the FTSE Global Equity Index Series
classified Pakistan as an emerging, not a frontier, market as of September 2010, while
Morgan Stanley classified Pakistan as an emerging market until December 2008 and as
of June 2017.'** Specifically with regard to the Fraser Institute relied on by Mr. Henry
and Dr. Howden, Claimant contends that it is a “libertarian think tank, without any
particular expertise in mining,” whose classification of Pakistan in its country risk ratings

“says literally nothing about the financeability of Reko Dig.”'®”

1298.Claimant also refers to a November 2008 ADB loan proposal to Balochistan relied on by
Respondent, which, in Claimant’s view, shows that “the very purpose of the proposal was
to provide a US$ 200 million loan to Balochistan to help it develop its mining sector,
including by way of private participation.” Quoting from Mr. Pingle, Claimant submits
that this document “is an indication that the ADB recognized the importance of the mining

sector [in Balochistan], recognized the importance of the Reko Dig Project.”'®*°

1299. Claimant further refers to Mr. Pingles’ testimony that Reko Diq could also have benefitted
from the support of Islamic Banks and government-supported funds, which it considers
to be unrebutted.!©*

1300. Therefore, Claimant argues that no commercial bank tranche would have been needed
and quotes from Mr. Pingle’s testimony that “[t]he commercial banks would not be
central to the financing process or the project funding.” Claimant notes that Mr. Howden
acknowledged at the Hearing on Quantum that DFIs and specifically the IFC regularly
act as mandated lead arrangers, which leaves no more than “an administrative role for
the banks.”'©*8

1301.Claimant maintains that the Oyu Tolgoi project illustrates that the Reko Diq project would
have been financed as “all of the commercial lending in the Oyu Tolgoi deal was either
ECA- or MIGA-insured, or under the umbrella of an IFC or EBRD B loan” and the IFC

served as Joint Mandated Lead Arranger, thus leaving no uncovered commercial loan
risk.! In Claimant’s view:
“Reko Dig is a world-class copper and gold asset, with no serious technical
risk, good economics even in a conservative case, the substantial backing of
two of the most successful mining companies in the world, and 25% local
government participation. It is located in a jurisdiction that the World Bank
and other multilateral agencies want to promote. It was to be financed during
acommodity boom. There is no doubt that, but for Pakistan’s breaches, Reko
Diq would have attracted the relatively modest financing required.” '®°

b. Summary of Respondent’s Position

1302. Respondent takes the position that the Reko Diq project would not have been financially
feasible from a bankability perspective because there was “no financing appetite” in the
market for the Reko Dig project given the “significant flaws in the standards underlying
the IMD FS and an array of other problems that made the project not bankable.” In
addition, Respondent argues that any decision by Claimant’s owners to fund the
development of the project on an equity basis would have required them to break their

internal policies and risk their market reputation. !°!

1303. According to Respondent, the issue to be decided by the Tribunal at this stage is “quite
different” from the question decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability because
Respondent then sought to prove a negative, i.e., that Claimant could not secure financing,
whereas Claimant now has to show that it could secure financing. Respondent argues that
there are substantial issues to be decided by the Tribunal at this point: (i) the Tribunal has
now for the first time received expert testimony on mining finance, with Respondent’s
experts showing that “the Resource could never have been financed given the severe
deficiencies in the IMD FS and the investment appetite for a Resource such as Reko Dig
in 2011”; (ii) Claimant has not provided any evidence of its ability to obtain financing
other than the testimony of Mr. Livesey at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, who

71652

described the financing as “particularly challenging, and the Tribunal only

concluded that “it appears improbable that [TCC] would not have been able to obtain
third-party financing from financial institutions’”'®> but did not make a finding that there
was actual interest in financing the project; it must therefore now decide on the effect of

the “critical challenges” raised by Respondent and its experts “in the context of the
valuation of the Resource’; (iii) the Feasibility Study does not contemplate full equity

financing “or equity financing of any kind” and Claimant has not presented any evidence
in support of its assertion that Barrick and Antofagasta would have approved “such an
aggressive financing method’ and further that they could “successfully lobby their
shareholders and convince them to risk a significant portion of their investment on a mine
that would not be operational for years’, and (iv) the Tribunal has not yet considered
Claimant’s prospects of financing in light of a failed Mineral Agreement which, in
Respondent’s view, “would have been instrumental in obtaining third-party financing, or

in proceeding with full-equity funding.”!°™*

1304. Respondent further submits that both the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules required that
a feasibility study supporting a mining lease application include a sufficient description
of the project’s financial structure in order to allow the GOB to make a decision whether
and on what terms to participate in the mining proposal and to enable the regulartory
authority to make a proper review of the financial viability of the project.!°>

1305.Respondent notes that Claimant stated in its Mining Lease Application that it contained
a detailed description of the “type and source and extent of financing” as well as
“particulars of the applicant’s ... financial resources and those of any person to be
engaged to provide such resources, together with supporting documentary evidence and
copies of relevant contractual agreements.”'®® Respondent contends that contrary to
these statements, the Mining Lease Application “did not provide any certainty of this
type” as the Feasibility Study had been prepared on the premise that the financial terms
would be defined following several contingencies: (i) the approval of the Feasibility
Study; (ii) the conclusion of shareholders’ agreement among Claimant’s owners; (iii) the
GOB’s review and decisions regarding the financials; (iv) the investment decision being
made and issued; and (v) formal discussion of financing with third-party financiers.
Respondent emphasizes that none of this occurred.'°*” In Respondent’s view, these
“regulatory and contractual shortcomings are extremely relevant as a matter of damage
quantification” because the price any buyer would have been willing to pay for Reko Diq
would have been “severely diminished by the knowledge that the mining lease

comply with TCC’s regulatory and contractual obligations.”'*

estimated financial structure of the proposed venture but was “only the starting point for
a long and complex process which, at the time of the mining lease application and even

at the Valuation Date, still required massive work in the identification of pending work,
followed by a quantification of several areas of cost and risk.” Respondent adds that the
boards of Claimant’s shareholders would consider the project only once that work was
finalized and, if approved by them, discussions with external financiers would start; only
at the end of these discussions could the costs of equity and debt financing be quantified
and “financial studies of the type required by BMR Rules 47” be submitted as part of a
mining lease application. According to Respondent, Claimant was therefore in default
under the 2002 BM Rules and the CHEJVA as of the valuation date.'®°

1307.Respondent considers it confirmed by the testimony of Claimant’s witnesses at the
Hearing on Quantum that “any decision by the prospective providers of equity and debt
financing was indeed far from being seriously procured.”'° Respondent refers to
Chapter 29 of the Feasibility Study, stating that there would be a further review of many
risks in the Risk Register for which an itemized cost had not yet been quantified.'©!
According to Respondent, these itemized costs would then be submitted to the boards of
directors of Antofagasta and Barrick, who have to this date not approved the Feasibility
Study and would have to vote on whether to invest in the mining proposal on the basis of
the aggregate financial exposure. Respondent emphasizes that only if a decision to invest
was reached by them and, as the case may be, by the GOB, discussions with third-party
financiers would commence and, only if those were fruitful, the estimated cash flows
“called for under BMR Rule 47” could be estimated.'°

1309. Respondent also refers to Claimant’s own description of the funding arrangements in the
Feasibility Study:

“At the feasibility stage, funding arrangements have been considered only on
a preliminary basis with a view to adding considerable fundability certainty
to the project during the project’s review and approval stage, after conclusion
of the FS. The FS together with the mining lease, the shareholder agreement
between the GOB and TCCA and the investment protection agreement
(Mineral Agreement) are the key prerequisites to effectively approach the
potential lenders to the project and finalise the design of the financing
plan”!

1310. According to Respondent, Claimant’s witnesses and experts “openly contradicted each
other—and in some cases the IMD FS” with regard to the financial structure of the
proposed venture. Respondent notes that: (i) the Feasibility Study is based on the premise
that Claimant and GOB would supply 60% of the required financing; (ii) Mr. Luksic
maintained that Antofagasta and Barrick would provide 100% of financing through debt
or equity; (iii) Mr. Septilveda stated that external financing from commercial banks with
some assistance from ECAs would be required; and (iv) Mr. Pingle testified that the
financing would instead be obtained through ECAs with no significant involvement from
commercial banks. In Respondent’s view, this confirms that the time of submitting the
Mining Lease Application, there was no financial plan that could meet “the strict
requirement of Article 1 of the CHEJVA and Rule 47 of the BMR.”'6°

1311.Respondent further submits that as of the valuation date, there were no agreements in
place among Claimant’s shareholders or with any third party regarding the funding of the
Reko Diq project. In particular, Respondent considers that neither Antofagasta nor
Barrick had expressed any commitment to actually fund the project or any indication as
to the financial costs. Respondent also contends that that in the absence of a definitive

postion on royalties and taxes, there could be no bankable feasibility study.!°°°

1312. Specifically with regard to the alleged commitment by Claimant’s owners, Respondent
contends that “Antofagasta did not have the corporate credit rating or access to
international debt markets sufficient to take on Reko Dig.” According to Respondent, any
decision to proceed without financing would have meant for it to assign almost half of its
cash to one project which would have been “a reckless commitment of the company’s
finances” that no reasonable board would have approved.!®*’ As for Barrick, Respondent
notes that Claimant has not provided testimony from any senior member of its ownership
or management structure but only Mr. Luksic’s testimony on his impressions of
conversations with his joint venture partner. Respondent acknowledges that Barrick “had
a broader access to the debt markets in November 2011” but argues that it had “rigid
policies that would not have permitted the kind of debt raising or cash spend necessary
to finance the Reko Dig project” and that “Barrick told its investors in 2011 that it was
looking for projects with a return on equity of 22%. Reko Diq’s financials were merely
half of that.” According to Respondent, Barrick would therefore have been unwilling and
even unable to approve the construction of Reko Diq, which had only a “quite low” post-
tax IRR of 12%.'%* Respondent notes that Oyu Tolgoi projected an ITT of more than
20%, reaching even as high as 29%, and claims that by contrast, the Reko Diq project
when including “all of the costs left out’ would have had an IRR far below 12%. In
Respondent’s view, the “subpar numbers at Reko Dig were far below any notion of a

solid return.”'©

1313. Respondent further refers to its experts who confirmed that there was only “very limited”
market appetite to provide financing for a project of the size and in the geographic
location of Reko Diq.'*” Respondent argues that “[t]he Oyu Tolgoi project was
consuming a large part of the available capital, both from the commercial banks and the

ECAs and DFIs” and it was therefore “not a good time to look for over one billion dollars
for a high-risk project with a low return” as “[n]o financier would have simultaneously
financed a low-grade, pre-development project located near taliban-occupied territory,
especially with the kinds of financials contemplated by Claimant.” In Respondent’s view,
Claimant has not provided any meaningful evidence to rebut this argument, considering
Claimant’s assertion “bizarre” that the financing for Oyu Tolgoi would confirm the
capacity for financing for Reko Diq; Respondent maintains that “[i]f the available mining
finance capital is one jurisdiction, there is no room for another” and that, in the absence
of any demonstration that there was excess, available capital, its argument stands
untouched, i.e., that “there was no capacity in commercial banks to even consider Reko
Dig”!

1314. Respondent also submits that mining financiers would not have been interested in Reko
Diq “without complete risk insurance, something which TCC had chosen not to
purchase.” In the absence of any discussion in the previous phase of the proceedings on
political risk insurance or financing by ECAs or the MIGA, Respondent considers that
Claimant failed to undertake “the basic step to ‘de-risk’ the political risk that would have

been one of the primary concerns of a financier.”!6”

1315.According to Respondent, the absence of capacity in commercial banks “dooms”
Claimant’s other arguments as commercial banks are necessary to arrange financing.
Referring to its experts, Respondent argues that: (i) it is market reality that commercial
banks act as mandated lead arrangers, which are in charge of leading the financing; (ii)
ECAs would not cover the entirety of any necessary financing but only up to 85% of the
value of the contracts and services originating from their home jurisdictions; and (iii)
DFIs also have limited ability to finance a project, funding only up to 30% of the total

loan,!63

1316.In response to Claimant’s reliance on financing by ECAs and DFIs, Respondent submits
that these institutions are conservative investors which follow the lead of commercial
banks but are not first movers. As for ECAs, Respondent argues that they provide largely

insurance cover but “would likely not make financing available.” In addition, Respondent

considers that the Feasibility Study did not have “a full picture of the capital costs, relying

largely on estimates” and argues that “[w]ithout knowing the source of inputs, once
cannot begin to even construct a pictures [sic] of the ECAs involved.” In any event,

Respondent contends that the ECAs would not have been eager to increase their exposure

to Pakistan, and particularly Balochistan, “due to the risks and difficulties of doing

business in that part of the world.”'6"

1317. With regard to DFIs, Respondent argues that they “have a focused mandate relative to

the part of the world they support’ and dedicate only a small portion of their balance
sheets to the extractive industries. Respondent notes that the ADB apparently did not
make investments in mining projects in 2012 which, in its view, “‘show[s] a disinterest in
the area.” According to Respondent, DFIs would have “limited interest in Reko Dig”
given that investing in Pakistan would have been a new market and they would have taken
“a cautious approach with strict limits to keep from stretching themselves too thin in an

unknown area.”'6

1318.In any event, Respondent submits that the process of finding ECAs and DFIs is “a time-

consuming process involving lengthy due diligence” and requiring approval by various
boards of directors of each institution. Respondent emphasizes that Claimant has never
reached the decision makers at any of these institutions and maintains that “[t]he story of
financing that TCCA has told is nothing more than that—a story.”'6!® Respondent points
out that the Oyu Tolgoi project, which was already in construction, required the
participation of numerous financing institutions, MIGA and multiple ECAs; by contrast,
Claimant had not even started to look for financiers and political risk insurance

underwriters, “a process that it was months and probably years from achieving.”!°"

1319.Respondent further contends that in the absence of a proper assessment and mitigation of

the environmental and social impacts of the project, the project would not have been
eligible for financing from the multilateral agencies and ECAs identified as primary

source of financing in the Feasibility Study.'©”*

1320. Respondent emphasizes that the credit committees of financial institutions do not accept

feasibility studies at face value but perform their own due diligence, “hiring many of the
same kinds of people that Pakistan has assembled” for technical, environmental, legal
and financial advice. Respondent notes that the financing for Reko Diq would have been
limited recourse, meaning that financiers had to base their risk assumptions on the
project’s risk and not, as suggested by Mr. Pingle’s view on financing, any corporate
guarantees or other collateral. In Respondent’s view, they would thus have detected the
same issues as Respondent did in the course of this arbitration and “no mining finance

institution would have gone forward with a loan based on the status of the work done for
the IMD FS.”'6”

1321.In this regard, Respondent also contends that “[a]ny attempt to get financing for the Reko
Dig project would have departed from a flawed foundation: the requirements of the
CHEJVA.” Respondent argues that “the standards at the Reko Dig project” were not
updated to the rules in place in 2006 when the Novation Agreement, pursuant to which
Claimant became a party to the CHEJVA (replacing BHP) on 1 April 2006 (the “2006
Novation Agreement”) was signed and adds that a mining finance instution would have
required a feasibility study “fit for regulatory practice in 2011, not an antiquated version
based on contractual standards forsworn by the mining finance world.”!*° Referring to
Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden, Respondent asserts that the Feasibility Study would not have
been considered “bankable” by the financial markets due to the standards of the CHEJVA
but also other “core issues not treated adequately by the IMD FS,” such as the uncertain
fiscal regime which Respondent considers to be “a key flaw undermining the bankability
of the IMD FS, which is before even getting to the technical flaws.”'®*' Respondent argues
that further “key concerns,” which would have prevented mining finance institutions from
financing the project, were the availability of water as well as security.'°*? Also referring
to the other “issues on the face of the IMD FS,” which Respondent raised throughout its

submissions, it considers it clear that “without a doubt Reko Dig was not bankable.”'%*?

1322. Respondent claims that the “Jittle information” available regarding the views of financiers
on the project reveal that “the project would have faced deep issues if it tried to obtain
financing,” in particular given the “very large amounts” and “underwhelming plans”
described in the Feasibility Study.'**+ In Respondent’s view, this is confirmed by the
Feasibility Study itself, which states that “the financing of the project will be ...
particularly challenging, and ... will require Antofagasta and Barrick to provide
guarantees until the project starts operations and reaches completion. It is likely that
commercial appetite for the financing of the project will be limited.”'®*°

1323.Respondent submits that by November 2011, “copper prices were already falling, and
the sentiment was that the decrease in copper prices would continue.” According to
Respondent, the major mining companies, i.e., the principal acquirers, were focusing on
“traditional, stable mining jurisdictions like Chile, Canada, and Australia,’ which

accounted for 53% of the acquisitions, while only 9% of all acquisitions were in
“emerging” regions and “no significant transactions” in “frontier (new) markets like

Pakistan.”'®°

1324. With regard to Claimant’s critique of the classification of Pakistan as a “frontier” market,
Respondent notes that it merely criticizes the Fraser Institute for its ideology but not for
its methodology. Noting that the Institute is supported, inter alia, by Barrick’s founder,
Respondent maintains that it “accurately identifies the issues at play in Pakistan that
make investment difficult.”'*’ Quoting from its experts, Respondent claims that there
were “no circumstances, from a country risk perspective, under which a credit committee
of a diligent mining institution would approve a mining project to be financed.” Arguing
that Claimant would have to convince “not just one credit committee but rather almost

every credit committee,” Respondent considers it confirmed that “there was no appetite

for financing in November 2011 for Reko Dig.”'***

1325. Respondent notes that the ADB analyzed the prospects of mining ventures in Balochistan
and stated that “continued reports of instability, attacks, plots, bombings, and even less-
destructive activities such as protests and work stoppages [in Pakistan] affect investor’s
views of the country’s overall stability. These perceptions affect Balochistan even more,
given the security concerns in the province.” It further reported that “some infrastructure,
logistics, and security-related obstacles need to be removed before investors begin to
consider investing in the province,” and that “[f]or mining operations to thrive, the
benefits that accrue to the local community need to be emphasized. This requires well-
designed contractual arrangements that result in a coordinated community development

plan endorsed by the local community, the government and the mine operator.” !°°

1326. According to Respondent, none of the issues it identified had been resolved before the
Mining Lease Application was submitted or at the valuation date, as a result of which
“financing would be rather hard to negotiate and guarantee, resulting in increased costs
and/or a reduced chance of the project ever coming to fruition.”'©°

1327.Respondent also maintains the argument that no mining company would actually have
been interested in buying the project from Claimant and claims that this should lead to a
reduction in value, considering the limited size of the asset for sale in relation to the
market. According to Respondent, a liquidity premium would have been considered by

any buyer using financing to account for “numerous features” such as the concentration
risk identified by Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden.!*!

1328.Respondent clarifies that it does not take the position that Claimant would have to find
financing for itself and a buyer but rather that “[t]he issue of financing arises from the
necessity of the market” as a buyer would have had to find financing for this purchase,
“especially since no company would have wanted to put a project with such low returns

on its books on an equity basis.”

ce. Tribunal’s Analysis

1329. At the outset of its analysis of the question whether Claimant has established that it could
have obtained the necessary financing for the project, the Tribunal recalls that Respondent
argued already in the liability phase of this proceeding that TCCP failed to establish that
it had or could obtain the resources to carry out the mining operations effectively as
required under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules because the Feasibility Study
addressed third-party financing only in the “vaguest and most incomplete and
unsatisfactory of terms.”'®? Similarly to the alleged failure to fully assess the water
source and the alleged failure to adequately address the security risks of the pipeline,
Respondent raised this argument for the first time in this arbitration. While finding that
Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to those invoked in the
Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal in any event found that none of these additional
reasons, including the reason invoked with regard to the financing of the project, would

justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application.'©*

1330.At the liability stage, the Tribunal was pointed in particular to the Introduction of the
Feasibility Study, which includes the following sub-sections:

“Prospective Fundability and Affordability

Prospective funding and affordability are important aspects of each
stakeholders’ investment decision: whether any required equity contribution
along with any required corporate guarantees are affordable, and whether
the project is fundable through conventional financial institutions,
particularly given the challenging aspects of the project.

While certain preliminary work has been undertaken during the FS stage in
relation to both ‘fundability’ and ‘affordability’, it is generally not deemed
appropriate to attend too much to these aspects of the project until completion

of the FS and, wherein, there is a well defined project and well defined
financial requirements.

Nevertheless, since financing often finds itself on a large capital project’s
critical path, certain preliminary work that had the potential to save
subsequent time and effort has been undertaken. Furthermore, the
Balochistan Mineral Rules require that the anticipated source of funding is
addressed within the FS. The following satisfies that requirement.
Financing Strategy

TCC’s Financing Plan for the project is to finance the development and
commissioning of the project with a combination of Senior Debt advanced by
a group of lenders and Shareholder Equity and subordinated Shareholder
Loans provided by the project sponsors.

The Senior Debt will be a traditional ‘Project Financing’ structure, similar to
the structure that the sponsors have successfully put in place for other
projects. Project Financing is typically sourced via consortiums consisting
primarily of large international financial institutions (IFIs), governmental
Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks.

Given the large capital requirement for Reko Dig the funding approach to be
undertaken will involve discussions with a large number of ECAs, IFIs, and
commercial banks. Additional funding sources, including the potential for an
Islamic tranche or funding tied to off-take will be evaluated. Finally, the
potential to fund particular items that make up the overall capital number is
being evaluated, particularly in connection with the power solution for Reko
Dig and the port.”!°>
1331.Mr. Luksic testified at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability that the Asian
Development Bank and a few agencies “were very, very interested” in being part of the
financing of the project but that “you need to have a fully approved project before you get
the financing.” In the context of the suggestion that the absence of a Mineral Agreement
would have made financing impossible or at least very difficult, he also testified that the

World Bank appeared “very committed to Pakistan developing mining.”'°*°

1332.In light of Mr. Luksic’s testimony and also taking into account that Antofagasta and
Barrick as two of the world’s largest mining companies were willing to contribute large
amounts of equity to the project, the Tribunal considered it improbable that Claimant’ s
owners would not have been able to obtain third-party financing from financial
institutions, such as the World Bank and/or the Asian Development Bank. The Tribunal
further noted that while the absence of a Mineral Agreement might have made third-party
financing more challenging, there was no indication of it being impossible.'®’ Besides
the fact that the Parties might have resumed negotiations after the grant of a mining lease,

the Tribunal considered the requirement that Respondent tried to impose on Claimant
regarding the financing details to be included in the Feasibility Study to be not realistic
and noted that Mr. Luksic had confirmed the statement made in the Feasibility Study that
it would have been premature to have more than general discussions on financing before
the project is approved and its financial reqirements are determined. In the Tribunal’s
view, this applied in particular where, as in the present case, a project-financing structure
was contemplated, which naturally requires that basic parameters of the project are fixed
before any financing institution would enter into a commitment or make a binding offer

on financing conditions.'*

1333.On that basis, the Tribunal considered that the information provided in the Feasibility
Study satisfied the requirement under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules and did not

justify a denial of the Mining Lease Application.'°?

1334. Claimant takes the position that the arguments raised by Respondent on financing in the
present quantum phase are “substantially identical’ to those raised in the liability phase
and have therefore been already rejected by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction
and Liability.'7°° Respondent, on the other hand, has pointed to the expert evidence on
financing which was adduced only in the quantum phase, the issues raised by Respondent
and its experts in various areas with regard to the Feasibility Study in the context of which
the Tribunal must re-evaluate the alleged lack of actual evidence on financing interest, a
new argument on the ability to proceed on 100% equity financing which triggered
submissions on Barrick and Antofagasta’s ability and willingness to contribute the
required amounts of equity as well as the impact of the lack of a Mineral Agreement.!7°!
Claimant has rebutted those arguments and maintains that Respondent “has offered no
good reason to reconsider the Tribunal’s holding [in the Decision on Jurisdiction and

Liability], and there is none.”!7°

1335.The Tribunal notes that the arguments at liability stage concerned the regulatory

financially feasible.”'™ In its Rejoinder, Respondent maintains “Reko Dig would not
have attracted the required financing.”'” In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent refers
to regulatory requirements of the 2002 BM Rules as well as to contractual requirements
under the CHEJVA and argues that in breach of these requirements and contrary to
Claimant’s own representation in the Mining Lease Application that it would provide a
detailed description of the “type and source and extent of financing” and the “particulars
of the applicant’s ... financial resources and those of any person to be engaged to provide
such resources, together with supporting documentary evidence and copies of relevant
contractual agreements,” Claimant did not provide any certainty of this type in the
Mining Lease Application, including in the Feasibility Study. In Respondent’s view, this
would have “severely diminished” the price that a hypothetical buyer would have been

willing to pay for Claimant’s stake in Reko Diq.'7°°

1336. Specifically, Respondent refers to rule 47 of the 2002 BM Rules and Clause | of the

CHEJVA which, in its view, were not complied with in the Mining Lease Application.
Respondent’s reference to Claimant’s submissions in the liability phase indicates that it
is referring to: (i) rule 47(2)(j)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that an
application for a mining lease “shall contain or be accompanied by — (i) a statement
giving a detailed forecast of capital investment, operating costs and revenues and the
anticipated type and source and extent of financing;”'” (ii) the definition of “Feasibility
Study” in Clause 1.1 of the CHEJVA, which provides that the Feasibility Study shall,
inter alia, include “financial studies relating to the estimation of discounted cash flow,
net present values, returns, fixed and working capital and operating costs and revenue
escalated to commencement of production”;'7® and (iii) Article 3.2 of the 2000
Addendum to the CHEJVA dated 4 March 2000 (2000 Addendum’) in which it was
agreed to include an additional requirement in the definition of “Feasibility Study,” i.e.,
“a plan for providing financing of all development costs of the mining project including

external debt agreements and equity contributions required from the Parties.”'1

1337. As Respondent’s reference in its Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum to Claimant’s Memorial

on Liability indicates, these regulatory and contractual requirements were already the
subject of submissions in the liability phase. However, the Tribunal considers it
noteworthy that neither of the above quoted requirements was raised by Respondent in
the context of its argument in the liability phase that Claimant failed to show that it had
or could obtain the necessary financing. Respondent also does not allege in the present

quantum phase that these requirements played any role in the denial of the Mining Lease
Application or that the GOB considered the Feasibility Study and/or Mining Lease
Application to be deficient at the time due to an alleged failure to comply with these
requirements. Respondent rather argues that these alleged shortcomings would have been
“extremely relevant as a matter of damage quantification” as they would have “severely
diminished” the price that a buyer would have been willing to pay based on “the
knowledge that the mining lease application, even if obtained, would have been secured
based on premises that did not comply with TCC’s regulatory and contractual obligations
to the GoB.”!7°

1338.As pointed out by Claimant, the argument that uncertainty on financing would have an
impact on the quantification of value was raised for the first time in Respondent’s Closing

Presentation at the Hearing on Quantum;!7!!

it was addressed by Claimant in its Post-
Hearing Brief and will be discussed further below. However, the argument that the alleged
uncertainty amounted to non-compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements

was raised only in Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum.

1339. The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument. In the absence of any indication that the
GOB or the Licensing Authority considered the description of the financing strategy
and/or the Chapter on Financing Analysis in the Feasibility Study to be non-compliant
with regulatory or contractual requirements, the Tribunal sees no basis to assume that a
buyer would have considered this to be an issue lowering the price it would be willing to
pay for the project.

1340.However, while Respondent placed great emphasis in its Post-Hearing Brief on the
argument that the Feasibility Study did not include a financial plan “that could meet the
strict requirements of Art. 1 of the CHEJVA and Rule 47 of the BMR,”'"”? it also
maintained its previous arguments, i.e., that there was no commitment on the part of
Claimant’s owners to actually fund the project, that the market appetite to provide third-
party financing to the Reko Dig project was “very limited,” that the alleged environmental
and social shortcomings in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study
rendered the project ineligible for financing from multilateral and export credit agencies,
and that the evidence in the record allegedly revealed that the project “would have faced
deep issues if it tried to obtain financing.” According to Respondent, the issues it had
identified meant that “financing would be rather hard to negotiate and guarantee,
resulting in increased costs and/or a reduced chance of the project ever coming to

fruition.”'7'

1341. Against this background, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant that the arguments
raised by Respondent in the quantum phase have already conclusively been dealt with in
the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. As noted in a more general manner in its
Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request, the Tribunal “did not make a finding
in the liability phase that the Feasibility Study fully reflected the true value of the project
at the time. It only assessed the arguments presented by Respondent at the time in support
of its position that denial of the Mining Lease Application was based on justifiable
reasons.”'”'* Similarly to the issues regarding water and metallurgy, which were
explicitly discussed in the Decision on Respondent’s Reconsideration Request, as well as
the question on security for the pipeline and the project in general, which was not
explicitly discussed in that Decision, neither of the Parties presented any opinions from
independent experts on the financeability of the project through third-party financing
and/or equity financing by Claimant’s owners in the liability phase as they have now done
in the quantum phase.

1342. The Tribunal also did not address the impact that any remaining uncertainty as to whether
and at what cost the project would have been financed had on the value of Claimant’s
investment. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that, as pointed out by Claimant, Prof. Davis
addressed the uncertainty regarding the nature of third-party financing by assuming all
equity financing by Claimant’s owners. Respondent, on the other hand, takes the position
that there is no evidence that the owners would have been willing or even able to provide
100% equity financing. These arguments were naturally raised only after Prof. Davis had
presented his valuation model in the quantum phase of this proceeding. Consequently, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate to make its conclusive findings on whether and, if so, at
what cost the project would have obtained financing based on the Parties’ completed
written submissions and the hearing of the fact and expert witnesses during the Hearing
on Quantum.

1343. The Tribunal understands that Prof. Davis assumed all equity financing in his model, not
because Claimant considered this to be the most likely financing scenario, but rather
because Respondent had previously raised the argument that the failure to conclude a
Mineral Agreement could have presented a risk to arrange external debt financing. In
Prof. Davis’ opinion, this assumption was conservative because if he “had prepared a
model that included external borrowing, the interest tax deductions associated with debt
financing would have increased the Project’s value, even if [he] had then discounted that
benefit to account for some risk that it would not materialize because the parties had

failed to conclude a mineral agreement.”'"

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -444-

1344. The Tribunal recalls that it has already reached the conclusion above that if the GOB had

not decided to take over the project from Claimant in breach of Respondent’s obligations
under the Treaty, a Mineral Agreement providing in particular for fiscal stability would
have been concluded after the mining lease was granted to TCCP. Consequently, the
Tribunal does not have to address in further detail Respondent’s argument that Claimant’s
prospects of obtaining both third-party financing and full-equity funding for the project
would have been “that much more remote” in the absence of a Mineral Agreement.!7!°

1345.In the Tribunal’s view, Prof. Davis’ assumption does not mean, however, that the

Tribunal can dispense with assessing the Parties’ arguments regarding the availability of
third-party financing. Apart from the dispute between the Parties as to whether there was
any commitment at all from Claimant’s owners to provide equity funding for the project,
which will be addressed in more detail below, the Tribunal does not consider it established
that Antofagasta and Barrick would in fact have funded the project all by themselves if
all attempts to arrange third-party funding failed. There is no indication to this effect in
the Feasibility Study and all equity funding was apparently not contemplated at the time.

1346. The Chapter of the Feasibility Study on Financial Analysis, the contents of which will be

addressed in more detail below, includes the following summary of project funding as

assumed in the financial model attached to the Feasibility Study: '7!”

1348. It is also noted that the 40% debt capacity was “estimated so that the commonly used debt
coverage ratios are deemed to be acceptable to the lenders for loans as described in Table
29.2” and that the 40% debt capacity “is only indicative and for the purpose of performing

the financial analysis of this FS.”"7!8

1349. Mr. Luksic testified in his second witness statement that “[i]n the very unlikely event that
project-level financing was not available, Antofagasta and Barrick could have funded the
project through corporate-level debt, whether bonds, loans, or some combination
therefore, or through all equity.”'"'° However, as Mr. Luksic himself confirmed both in
his witness statement as well as at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability and the
Hearing on Quantum, Antofagasta and Barrick were contemplating to obtain third-party
financing for a part of the project and the Tribunal cannot see sufficient indication in the
contemporaneous record that both owners would have been ready to fund the entire
project cost by themselves if project finance turned out to be unavailable for the project.

1350.Consequently, the Tribunal will address two questions: (i) whether Claimant has
established that its owners were able and willing to provide the contemplated amount of
60% equity funding to the project; and (ii) whether Claimant has further established that
it could have financed the remaining amount of 40% of the project costs through limited
recourse funding to be obtained from third parties. As Prof. Davis has not included the

costs of project financing in his calculated model, the Tribunal will also assess whether
he has accurately accounted for any remaining uncertainty as to the identity of the lenders
and costs of financing for the project.

i. Whether Claimant Has Established That Its Owners Were Able and
Willing to Provide the Contemplated Amount of Equity Funding to the
Project

1351.As to the amount of equity funding contemplated in the Feasibility Study, there is
common ground to the extent that the project did not reach the stage at which the boards
of Claimant’s owners Antofagasta and Barrick gave their approval to start executing the
project and/or to formally commit the contemplated amounts of equity to the project. As
pointed out by Respondent, the Forward Work Plan provided that the “/Jnvestment
Decision” and “Project Commitment” would be made after the Feasibility Study and
funding approval.!7?°

1352.The question is therefore whether Claimant has established that Antofagasta and Barrick
would have made the contemplated commitment in the absence of Respondent’s Treaty
breaches, i.e., if TCCP’s Mining Lease Application had been granted in November 2011.
In this regard, Claimant refers to the testimony of Antofagasta’s chairman Mr. Luksic,
who stated:

“By the time we had completed our Feasibility Study in 2010, we had done
all the work we needed to satisfy ourselves that this was an extremely
attractive project. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that this was a
mine that was worth building and that we wanted to be the ones to build it.
My conversations with our partners at Barrick confirmed that they felt the
same way and I would not have expected anything else. We had found what
we had been looking for—a world class deposit—and we were eager to get to
work.

A large mine, of course, requires large capital expenditure but the economics
of the Reko Dig project were sufficiently robust that we expected that we
would be able to repay the initial investment in seven years, a comparatively
short payback period. Once the payback period was over, we expected very
healthy cash flows. Indeed, as I mentioned in Paris, the cost of production
was very low, which meant that we would have had very attractive margins,
even in times of depressed commodities prices, not to mention major profits
in times when commodities prices were high.

As I began to explain to the Tribunal in Paris, we had already started
speaking informally to financial institutions and other investors about the
project and found that there was a lot of interest among both groups in
financing it. For example, I recall speaking to the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, and a few others, who all expressed interest. Although it

was too early to enter into serious project financing negotiations, there was
no doubt in my mind that financing was readily available. Antofagasta and
Barrick are well-known and highly credit-worthy sponsors and I believe there
are many banks and other investors who would have funded us. In the very
unlikely event that project-level financing was not available, Antofagasta and
Barrick could have funded the project through corporate-level debt, whether
bonds, loans, or some combination thereof, or through all equity."

1353.While the Tribunal noted above that the contemporaneous record does not provide
sufficient support for Mr. Luksic’s statement that both Antofagasta and Barrick would in
fact have been willing to provide 100% funding to the project if all attempts to secure
third-party financing failed, Mr. Luksic’s testimony makes clear that Antofagasta was
committed to developing this project, including by providing equity funds to the project.
In Respondent’s view, however, Mr. Luksic’s testimony at the Hearing on Quantum that
100% of the funds would be provided by Antofagasta and Barrick contradicted not only
the contemplated financing structure in the Feasibility Study but also the testimony of
Claimant’s other witnesses.

1354. Mr. Luksic clarified in his oral testimony that his statement regarding the expectation that
the initial investment would be paid back in seven years was based on an estimate of
certain financing conditions in the Feasibility Study.'”? Mr. Luksic could not confirm,
however, whether the weighted cost of capital to which Mr. Septilveda had referred in his
explanations on the financial model of the Feasibility Study, also included the costs of
third-party financing but merely presumed, confronted with a document he had not seen
before, that the cost of capital he was looking at was based on pure equity financing.
‘When asked whether it was his understanding at the time the Feasibility Study was drafted
and submitted to the GOB that Antofagasta and Barrick would contribute 100% of the
financing, Mr. Luksic stated: “J presume so. I don’t remember exactly this particular
issue.” More specifically, when asked whether it was his understanding that Antofagasta
would have contributed USD 1.75 billion to finance the project, he clarified that
Antofagasta “could have done it. Yes” but that there was no decision to do that because
they “never got that far.”'” Mr. Luksic then explained:

“Q. Why would you have been talking to multilateral agencies and
commercial banks and ECAs if the funds would have come from Antofagasta's
treasury?

A. It is not unusual when you're looking at a project that you, as owners, start
with the first scenario, which is you looked at the possibility of all equity

finance, and then you move to alternative financings, like bank financing,
agency financing, and other mechanisms.

So it's just a stage that you're at. And I presume they didn't have firm offers
from banks to say--or to look at the Cost of Capital, Cost of Financing of the
Project.”\74
1355.Mr. Luksic was then presented with an excerpt of Mr. Livesey’s testimony at the Hearing
on Jurisdiction and Liability in which he had stated that “the owners were going to finance
60 percent of this from their own treasuries,” and testified as follows:
“What I was trying to explain is that, looking at the other page, I didn't see
the split between bank financing and the cost of bank financing that you were
referring to, and so I took the view that probably that spreadsheet you showed
me there was accounting for full equity financing.
Now, of course, I'm sure that the company was already devising ways of
financing this, and they were already thinking which could be, and a 60
percent owner's finance with a 40 percent bank or institution finance made
sense, but my recollection is that we never got to the point where we had firm
offers from banks. That's what I was saying. I may be wrong. Maybe there

1356.Respondent also referred to the testimony of Mr. Septilveda, Finance Manager at
Antofagasta at the relevant time, who was involved in assembling the final version of the
financial model for the Feasibility Study.!’° Mr. Septilveda testified about the efforts to
obtain project financing, which will be discussed in more detail below, and was then
asked whether there was any decision by the shareholders or the Board of Directors of
Antofagasta to commit any actual amount to financing the development of Reko Digq. In
response, Mr. Septilveda stated that “to my knowledge, the Feasibility Study says that 60
percent of the initial Capex was going to be funded by the shareholders, and never heard
that Antofagasta wouldn't provide its pro rata for that capital.” He further confirmed his
understanding that the plan was for Antofagasta and Barrick to each provide half of the
60% of USD 3.8 billion but that he did not recall “any written commitment in paper” and
was not aware of a resolution of Antofagastas’ shareholders or Board to commit 30% of
the required capital costs to the project.!’7 When asked where the 30% to be contributed
by Antofagasta would have come from, he stated that “Antofagasta is a company that
normally holds a lot of cash. Actually, if the the Board so decided, it could have financed
the Project 100 percent in cash.” He also confirmed that “[i]f we approached the banks
after obtaining the Mining Lease, it would have been with the commitment of Antofagasta

to provide the funds” but that there had not yet been a mandate to look for the financing
“because we didn’t obtain the Mining Lease, and the Mining Lease was the main

milestone to approach the banks.”'78

1357.Finally, Respondent also referred to the testimony of Claimant’s expert Mr. Pingle, who

based his expert opinion on the assumption that 60% of costs would be funded by Sponsor
Equity and further testified that, in his opinion, the remaining 40% could have been
funded by ECAs, without additional sources of funding, as will discussed in more detail

below.!7°

1358. In the Tribunal’s view, there is no contradiction between the testimony of Mr. Luksic and

the contemplated financing structure in the Feasibility Study or the testimony of
Claimant’s other witnesses. Mr. Luksic made clear that while Antofagasta would have
been able to do 100% equity financing, any presumption of full equity financing for the
purposes of calculating the project’s capital costs would have been due to the stage of the
project in which financing offers from third parties were not yet available and the costs
of financing were therefore not yet clear. Mr. Luksic also confirmed that the contemplated
60% owner finance plus a 40% bank or institution finance “made sense” but simply noted
that the project had not yet proceeded to a stage where it had received firm offers from
banks. Consequently, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that the alleged
contradictions would confirm the absence of a financial plan for the project.

1359.As pointed out by Respondent, Claimant has not submitted a document in which

Antofagasta’s Board of Directors or shareholders approved the commitment of an amount
equal to 30% of the project’s capital cost. Mr. Septilveda testified that he was not aware
of such a document and that a confirmation of that commitment would have been required
when approaching financing institutions for funding offers. He also emphasized that a
mandate from Antofagasta to obtain funding offers would have come only after the
mining lease was granted. Mr. Pingle likewise considered that it would have been
premature to obtain the final commitment from Antofagasta’s Board of Directors at the
stage of the Reko Dig project. He explained:

“Typically, the Board doesn't want to make a final commitment until both the

equity and the--they can give approval for signing the loan documents as well.

And they'll ask for that information. You'll have indications from the Board

before that, but typically it doesn't go for final approval until you have a

number of things in place that were not in place yet. So, it was premature, in

my opinion, to take this to the Board of Directors for a final commitment.”'7*°

1360.In the Tribunal’s view, the absence of an actual commitment of funds to the project
therefore does not provide any indication that Antofagasta would not have been willing
to make that commitment at the relevant time, i.e., after the Mining Lease Application
was granted.

1361.Respondent further argues that Antofagasta did not have a corporate credit rating and
would therefore have faced difficulties to access international debt financing facilities, as
a result of which it would have had to assign “almost half of its cash on hand to one
project with all the risks described above and for an IRR near 12%.” Respondent claims
that “[n]o reasonable board would have approved such a reckless commitment of the

company’s finances.”'!

1362.The Tribunal notes that Respondent apparently does not dispute that Antofagasta would
have had sufficient cash reserves to approve the contemplated equity funding for the
project. That this was in fact the case was confirmed by Mr. Septilveda who testified that
“if the Board so decided, it could have financed the Project 100 percent in cash.” Mr.
Pingle also pointed out that the amounts of cash and cash equivalents, liquid investments
and undrawn lines of credit that were available to Antofagasta as of 31 December 2011
were considerably larger than the amount of USD 1.16 billion it would have had to
contribute to the project.'7*>

1363.Respondent rather claims that it would have been “reckless” for Antofagasta to commit
this sum to the project, taking into account the various risks identified by Respondent in
its submissions. Respondent’s experts also expressed an opinion on Antofagasta’s
willingness to fund the project in their first report:

“Given its more limited financial capacity, Antofagasta had one key
development asset in 2011, which was the US$1.3B Antucoya development
project. By comparison, the Project was noted by Antofagasta’s management
in their 2010 Annual Report as growth ‘beyond the core business’ and as an
‘earlystage growth’ opportunity — already signalling to capital markets that
it was peripheral to their main corporate strategy. We do not see any clear
evidence from Antofagasta’s market disclosures and financial reporting that
it was (i) undertaking any serious internal processes to commit existing
capital to the Project, (ii) considering mitigating the inherent geopolitical
risks that it would be exposed to if it directly equity funded the Project ina
jurisdiction that it was very unfamiliar with or (iii) positioning the Project as
a core part of its growth to raise its profile ahead of an institutional capital
raising (either debt or equity). Given its conservative nature and its core
corporate objectives ..., we do not believe that financing of its interest in the
Project was being seriously considered at the time in question or that

preparatory steps were being undertaken to mitigate subsisting financing risk
that should have been very obvious to Antofagasta’s management.”'7

1364. At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Howden further clarified with regard to Antofagasta that

“T don't think I've ever made that statement, that it was not serious about going forward
with the project. I'm saying that it was not serious about starting the funding for the
Project at that point.”'”*+ When pointed to Antofagasta’s 2011 annual report in which it

fact that it's going through arbitration to obviously--as it says here, to help develop the
project doesn't necessarily mean that that Project would be one of the first to be developed
in its pipeline of opportunities. That's what I'm saying.” He maintained that “it wasn’t
serious about taking the Project forward in terms of its position in the pipeline of

transactions.”'7°6

1365. Mr. Pingle stated in his report that he had “no doubt that the Sponsors would have wanted

to go forward with the development of the Project and would have committed to fund the
equity portion of the Project financing.” He added that, in his experience, “it would be
remarkable for the Sponsors to invest hundreds of millions of US$ on feasibility studies
that demonstrated a world class reserve, low cost mining operations and the economic
viability of the Project, only to abandon it.”'7*’ Specifically with regard to the alleged
lack of clear evidence in Antofagasta’s market disclosures that it was willing to finance
the project, Mr. Pingle considered that this could not detract from the amounts already
invested to demonstrate the profitability of the project. Mr. Pingle further stated that
having reviewed the sponsors’ financial statements, he had “no doubt that the Sponsors
could have funded the Project at the corporate level, either with equity or some
combination of equity and debt, had financing at the Project level been unavailable for

some unforeseen reason.”'1°

1366.The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Pingle that the previous investments made by both

Antofagasta and Barrick with regard to the exploration work, in particular the Feasibility

Liability as follows: “Barrick and Antofagasta are backing this project all the way
through. They made all the payments up to this point. It's, I think, perfectly reasonable to
expect that TCC can obtain the technical and financial resources and experience to carry

out the mining operation.”""

1367. While the Tribunal also appreciates the fact that the amount to be invested to actually
build the mine would be considerably higher than the previously invested amounts, the
Tribunal sees no indication that either of the sponsors was not serious about its
commitment to the project, including the contemplated portion of equity funding. In
particular, the Tribunal is not convinced by the conclusion drawn by Mr. Henry and Mr.
Howden’s from Antofagasta’s 2010 annual report, which listed the completion of the
Reko Dig Feasibility Study and ESIA among certain items of “Growth beyond the Core
Business.”'™ Dr. Howden himself clarified at the Hearing on Quantum that he was not
questioning the seriousness of Antofagasta’s intent to go forward with the project but
rather considered that it “was not serious about starting the funding for the Project at that
point?"74!

1368. As noted above, the Tribunal does not consider the absence of an actual commitment of
funds to the project as an indication that Antofagasta would not have been willing to make
that commitment at the relevant time. In the Tribunal’s view, no conclusion to the
contrary can be drawn from the excerpt of Antofagasta’s 2010 annual report on which
Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden relied.

1369.In addition to the previous investments made by both owners, the fact remains that the
financial model of the Feasibility Study, which was prepared with the involvement of,
inter alia, Mr. Septilveda for Antofagasta, expressly contemplated that the owners would
contribute 60% equity. Mr. Livesey testified already at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and
Liability that “[t]he funding section of the Feasibility [Study] was put together primarily

71742 Which confirms that both owners

by the owners’ teams back in Santiago and Toronto,
were well aware of the assumptions underlying the financial model of the Feasibility
Study. In the absence of any indication in the record that Antofagasta was not willing to
contribute its share of the contemplated equity funding, the Tribunal sees no basis to doubt

Antofagasta’s willingness (or ability) to provide its 30% share of the project costs.

1370. As for Barrick, Respondent acknowledged that it had “broader access to the debt markets
in November 2011” but claims that its “rigid internal policies” would not have ermitted
it to raise debt or spend cash on the Reko Diq project. Specifically, Respondent argues

that “Barrick told its investors in 2011 that it was looking for projects with a return on
equity of 22%. Reko Diq’s financials were merely half of that.” Mr. Henry and Mr.
Howden expressed the following opinion on Barrick’s willingness to fund the project:

“With respect to its internal Treasury policy and decisionmaking processes,
we note that Barrick maintained a series of rigorous internal risk controls
with respect to market risks (commodity, FX &c.) as well as other nonmarket
risks that could have involved the use of credit derivatives in order to mitigate
counterparty risks. From an internal returns hurdle perspective, in its 2011
Annual Report, Barrick notes to its shareholders that it is achieving a 22%
return on equity (2010 Barrick Annual Report: 19% RoE) and that a key
management objective at this time was to maximise return on equity. On the
basis of this key objective communicated to its shareholders, in context, Reko
Diq’sproject return was only 11% as per the IMD FS. When taking the
Project return into account along with its inherent frontier market risk being
assumed to build such a project in Pakistan in 2011 and in the absence of
project finance debt from the global debt market being genuinely available in
order to bolster the return on equity allocated by TCC’s sponsors, we do not
believe that the Project would have passed the rigorous internal hurdles that
Barrick describes in general terms to its shareholders. We note that, in
Barrick’s 2010 Annual Report, the Project did not rank among its advanced-
stage projects that were being provided with capital commitments by internal
treasury — putting this in context, by 2011, with the copper market already
showing signs of weakness, it is our belief that the Project would still not have
advanced through Barrick’s internal treasury decision making process to be
allocated committed capital — this means that, in all events, we believe that
the Project would not have been advanced. Furthermore, beyond its internal
hurdles and stated corporate objectives, we believe that the wider capital
markets would have questioned why Barrick would develop an additional
project beyond its existing project pipeline where the incremental gain would
be only c.US$250M (Barrick’s share of the Project NPV gain) compared to
its share of capital expenditure outlayed being over US$1.5B on the
Project.”'™4

1371.Mr. Pingle noted in his expert report that “JRR and return on equity are two different
concepts.” He explained that an all-equity, Project IRR is unlevereaged and “designed to
test project viability on a conservative basis,” i.e., without adding leverage that would
increase the IRR; by contrast, return on equity is “an annual calculation based on
earnings and shareholder equity.” Mr. Pingle further stated that the 22% return on equity
that Barrick earned in 2011 was not stated in the annual report to be a “hurdle rate” for
investment and was in any event “anomalously high both for the industry in that year and
Barrick historically.” In his opinion, the suggestion that Barrick would have refused to

finance a project with an IRR below 22% would be “not only speculative but also utterly

implausible.”""*

1372.Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden did not respond to this argument in their second report. The
Tribunal also notes that in the excerpt of Barrick’s 2011 annual report submitted by Mr.
Henry and Dr. Howden in support of their initial report, the President and CEO stated in
his message to the shareholders that “[c]apturing the benefits of margin expansion and
strong operating results, Barrick achieved a return on equity of 22% in 2011.”'"*° As
pointed out by Mr. Pingle, there is no indication in this excerpt that Barrick considered
this return on equity achieved to be a hurdle rate for future investments. Mr. Henry and
Dr. Howden themselves noted that the achieved return on equity was 3% higher than in
2010, which is in line with Mr. Pingle’s testimony that the 2011 figure was extraordinarily
high in 2011. In any event, Mr. Pingle explained why the IRR calculated in the Feasibility
Study cannot be compared to an actual return on equity achieved. As will be discussed in
further detail below, the Tribunal finds it plausible that the financial model of the
Feasibility Study was not intended to capture the full value of the cash flows that Reko
Diq would generate over the years but was designed to test whether the project was viable
when applying conservative assumptions.

1373. Against this background, the Tribunal again cannot accept the conclusion drawn by Mr.
Henry and Dr. Howden from Barrick’s annual reports and again sees no indication that
Barrick was not willing to contribute its share of the equity financing contemplated in the
Feasibility Study. In particular, the fact that Barrick had not yet ranked the Reko Diq
project among the projects to which it committed capital from its internal treasury in its
2010 annual report does not provide an indication that Barrick was not serious about
doing so at the relevant time, i.e., after the Mining Lease Application was granted.

1374. There was no dispute between the Parties that Barrick was able to provide the required
funds. Mr. Pingle pointed to the amounts of cash and cash equivalents available to Barrick
as of 31 December 2011 as well as a Credit Facility of USD 4 billion finalized by Barrick

in January 2012.'747

1375.Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that it has no reason to doubt that Claimant’s
owners would have been willing and able to provide the contemplated amount of equity
funding to the project.

ii. Whether Claimant Has Established That It Could Have Financed the
Remaining Amount of the Project Costs Through Limited Recourse
Funding

1376. The second question for the Tribunal to address is whether Claimant has established that
it could have financed the remaining amount of the project’s capital cost through limited
recourse funding.

1377. Respondent’s experts, in their first report, reached the conclusion that “there was unlikely
to be global debt market capacity to directly fund the Project based on 2011 market
conditions,” relying in particular on the fact that another, more advanced copper-gold
porphyry project in Oyu Tolgoi was in the process of obtaining financing from the same
agencies and financing institutions in 2011. In addition, they expressed the opinion that
“TCC had not yet completed a ‘bankable’ feasibility study and had not taken necessary
steps to de-risk the Reko Dig project with respect to tenure (licencing and agreed fiscal
terms)” and that therefore “a diligent mining finance institution would not have
considered advancing a frontier market debt transaction based on the level of studies that

had been undertaken.”'™*

1378.By contrast, Mr. Pingle stated in his report that “[t]here was ample capacity in the market
from ECAs and DFIs to finance [the remaining 40%]” and expressed the opinion that the
Feasibility Study’s financing chapter was “unduly conservative” as there was “ample
liquidity among ECAs and DFIs, and there would have been no need for a commercial
tranche, meaning that no commercial bank would be asked to consider taking Project or
country risk.” He specifically rejected the argument that there was shortage of liquidity
or capacity in the 2011-2012 period and presented contemporaneous statements and
figures from various ECAs and DFls in support of his opinion '“° Mr. Pingle further
explained why, in his opinion, the financing for the Oyu Tolgoi project confirmed, rather
than contradicted, the assumption that there was ample capacity in the market to also fund
the Reko Digq project. Specifically, he stated:
“T find the arguments of Respondent’s Experts bizarre. Oyu Tolgoi does not
show that Reko Dig could not have been financed. In fact, precisely the
contrary is true. The successful financing of the Oyu Tolgoi project
demonstrates that there was significant appetite and ample capacity for the
financing of world-class mining projects, even in a challenging place like
Mongolia, with an open pit mine dependent upon shipment by road to
smelters in China, political turmoil, and no precedent of a large mining
project in Mongolia. Oyu Tolgoi indicates that there was substantial

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -456-

financing capacity available, suggesting that Reko Dig could have secured
the required financing.”'"°

1379.In their second report, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden did not reiterate their argument that

there was not sufficient capacity in the market to fund the project. They rather expressed

the opinion that Claimant took “a very naive approach to debt finance and ma{d]e the

critical error of believing that financial capacity of an institution is akin to willingness

and credit approval to invest in a specific project in a specific jurisdiction.” They further

considered that “[s]imply having the balance sheet capability to fund a project is

irrelevant and ignores the process and internal requirements before funding can be

committed. Further this ‘capacity concept’ ignores the requirement for ECA’s to provide

funding on the back of commercial contracts with national sponsors and, even then,

funding is in most cases provided via commercial lenders with insurance cover from the

ECA.”'®! In the absence of “any meaningful” engagement with commercial lenders

during the period in question, they noted that “any conversations with ECAs would not

have been materially advanced.” In addition, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden noted that
“Te]ven if TCC’s argument that the capacity of the DFIs and ECAs was sufficient to show
appetite for funding, TCC has not shown that these institutions were deploying significant

amounts into the mining space generally, let alone to a mining project in Pakistan

specifically.”'7>?

1380.In the Tribunal’s view, Mr. Henry’s and Dr. Howden’s arguments make clear that they

did not uphold their initial opinion that there was unlikely to be sufficient capacity in the

global debt market to provide funding for the Reko Diq project. Their argument with

regard to Oyu Tolgoi rather evolved towards the issue of concentration risk which might

be a factor to be considered by agencies that were already involved with the Oyu Tolgoi

project. They further rejected Mr. Pingle’s opinion that no commercial tranche of funding

would have been required and pointed out that “ECA financing can cover 85% of the

contract value of the export of goods and services from the ECA’s home country. The

impact of this clause means that commercial lenders typically have 15% of the debt

uninsured and therefore lenders take political and commercial risk on a substantial

portion of the debt even where ECA cover is provided.”'">? Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden

emphasized:

“Tt must be remembered that commercial banks take full political and credit
risk on the uninsured 15% of the debt and as such, like any typical credit
institution, require full assessment of the project to repay the debt facility in

full; ECA insurance is a risk mitigation tool for lenders and they cannot rely
on this as the primary source of repayment.

The process undertaken by lenders to assess the creditworthiness of a project
is rigorous, time consuming and highly involved. To a certain extent, ECAs
rely on the work of the lenders, but also have additional items they require to
provide the insurance cover which can materially delay the project
funding?"

1381.Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden considered that there was “no evidence that banks were, in
fact, lining up to fund the Reko Dig project specifically” and noted that “TCC had barely
started engaging with ECAs, DFIs and lenders to discuss funding for Reko Dig, a process
that from our own experience can take many years of hard work to complete.” In
particular, they referred to the process of structuring the financing for the Oyu Tolgoi

project which took almost five years.!7°°

1382. It is undisputed that Claimant had not yet received offers from any financing institutions
but, as the Tribunal has already held in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and as
was confirmed by Mr. Luksic and also Mr. Septilveda at the Hearing on Quantum, it
would have been premature to approach financing institutions for specific offers before
the mining lease was granted. The question can therefore only be a hypothetical one, i.e.,
whether Claimant could have obtained the necessary financing in the future if the mining
lease had been granted in November 2011.

1383. As pointed out by Respondent, the Feasibility Study states in this regard:

“Tt is expected that the financing of the project will be possible yet
particularly challenging, and that it will require Antofagasta and Barrick to
provide guarantees until the project starts operations and reaches
completion. It is likely that commercial appetite for the financing of the
project will be limited; therefore, the anchor of the financing plan will be the
multilateral agencies and export credit agencies (ECAs), with international
and local commercial banks plus Islamic banks only contributing a small
proportion of the financing. Among the multilateral agencies, it is anticipated
that Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank will be
approached, as well as the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
Furthermore, the level of visibility of the procurement plan will allow the
approach to certain ECAs such as JBIC, NEXI, KExim, KEIC, China Exim
and European ECAs.”'7*°

1384.Mr. Pingle stated in his report that he considered this to be “an unduly pessimistic

assessment” and did not believe that the financing of the project would have been
“particularly challenging” or that a commercial bank tranche would have been necessary.

In his opinion, the entire debt financing could have been obtained from ECAs and
DFls.'7°7 At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Pingle further stated that the necessary funding
could have been provided by ECAs only, with DFIs as well as Islamic Banks and Funds

being possible additional sources of funding.'7*

1385.Specifically, Mr. Pingle agreed with Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden that the OECD
Arrangement Terms allow ECAs to fund up to 85% of the contract value to be covered
but noted that the remaining 15% were a “down payment” that was initially required to
be paid out of equity and it was only later that banks started to lend these 15%. He added
that “the Sponsors here have plenty of equity to fund that 15 percent down payment.”'7°°
He further explained that “[t]ypically 60 percent of a large mining project’s Project Costs
are eligible for ECA financing” and noted that together with the 60% equity from the
project sponsors, this would already amount to 120% of the project costs.!° Also
referring to the DFIs and the Islamic Development Bank as a form of risk mitigation, Mr.
Pingle stated that “there’s a very limited role for commercial banks here.” In particular,
he noted that even if commercial banks were funding loans covered by ECAs, they would
be taking the risk of the country standing behind the ECA. Similarly, for the ADB or IFC
B loans, their risk would be non-payment by the IFC or ADB and thus “a substantially
different risk than an uncovered commercial loan would be.”'">! He concluded:
“The commercial banks would not be central to the financing process or the
project funding. There is an administrative role for the banks in terms of the
ECAs, in terms of collecting drawdown documentation, submitting it for
drawdown and getting payments. This is not a lending or a risk issue.

And it's true in all of the countries where we're talking about ECAs. Any
licensed commercial bank in that country can perform that function,
including foreign banks licensed to do business in that country.”!

1386. Mr. Pingle clarified that he was not ruling out the possibility of any funding provided by
commercial banks but rather the necessity of a tranche where commercial banks would
be taking country risk. He explained:

“If the ECAs only provided insurance, there could have been a commercial
bank tranche. All of the institutions that are talked about can give direct
loans, and people like U.S. EXIM Bank prefer to give direct loans, and during
the financial crisis, direct loans were far more prevalent than--this is the
period we're talking about here--were far more prevalent than the
commercial bank loans because the commercial bank loans had a liquidity

problem and the export credit agencies being government funded did not. So
it would--I'm not ruling out the possibility, but it would have been less likely
that there would have been any commercial bank funding.”""

1387.Mr. Pingle emphasized that an ECA-insured tranche funded by a commercial bank was a
“different category” than a commercial bank tranche and considered it “misleading to
count it as a commercial bank tranche.” When pointed to the fact that the Feasibility
Study had assumed a “Commercial tranche” of USD 300 million, in addition to an
“Agencies tranche” of USD 1,250 million in its financial analysis! Mr. Pingle
maintained that “J don’t happen to agree that they would have needed it’ but confirmed
that “[t]hat’s what they considered they would use.” Mtr. Pingle also confirmed that he
did not agree with Mr. Septilveda as to whether ECAs would provide direct funding or
insurance to commercial banks.!7°° Mr. Septilveda had stated in this regard that “it's usual
that you don't talk directly to the Export Credit Agencies. You do that through the banks
because the ECAs provide insurance to commercial banks so that the commercial banks

gives [sic] you the credit line. So, that is a normal practice.”'1

1388.Before addressing the differences in opinion expressed by the Parties’ witnesses and
experts, the Tribunal notes that it appears to be undisputed that Claimant could not have
obtained uncovered commercial loans, i.e., without insurance or coverage by ECAs or
DFIs. Mr. Pingle specifically confirmed that “[w]e never see the commercial banks taking
uncovered risk in that area, and that's true--been true for the Philippines, it's been
through for Indonesia. Now, as these countries have gotten more developed and so on,
the situation has improved. But I don't believe that uncovered commercial risk would
have been available for this Project, and if it had been, it would have been so short a term

as to have been irrelevant.”'7

1389. The Tribunal recalls that Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden initially argued that the limit of 85%
being funded by ECAs meant that the remaining 15% would have to be funded by
commercial lenders at their own risk. At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Howden agreed,
however, that “the remaining amount [can be] provided in some form. It can be provided
in equity, yes.”'" He then stated that ECAs would normally insure only 95% of that 85%
so that commercial banks would “still have to take a 5 percent risk on that portion of the
debt being uninsured.” He clarified that there would “potentially be a portion that the

banks will hold that is uninsured by the Export Credit Agency” but confirmed that he had
not provided any support for this statement in his report.'7?

1390. In addition to the admitted lack of support for Dr. Howden’s statement at the Hearing on
Quantum, the Tribunal also sees no reason why such a 5% or other portion could not have
been paid with equity rather than having to resort to an uninsured commercial loan which,
according to Mr. Pingle, would not have been available on reasonable terms. Given the
contemplated amount of equity to be contributed by the owners, the Tribunal sees no
reason to assume that any limitation on the amount of funding provided by ECAs would
have resulted in the necessity to obtain an uninsured commercial loan.

1391.The question is therefore whether Claimant would have been able to obtain financing
from ECAs or insured by ECAs and/or DFIs. Dr. Howden agreed at the Hearing on
Quantum that ECAs “can direct lend, but also lend via the commercial lenders covered
by insurance” but maintained that “the idea that the DFIs and the ECAs themselves could
have funded Reko Dig, in our view, is not grounded in the reality of the market” and that
“you also then need the commercial lenders.” Specifically, he maintained that ECAs
would “be generally looking to provide insurance to lenders rather than funding
themselves” as a result of which “actual commercial banks would be involved in the
transaction.”'"” Dr. Howden further presented the funding structure of the Oyu Tolgoi
project and added:

“So, in our view, the Reko Dig would have had a similar structure to the Oyu

Togoi transaction which included, as I said, multilaterals, Export Credit
Agencies, and lenders, as a group, to actually fully fund the Project.”"""

1392.Dr. Howden further emphasized that “we’re talking about a long and slow process”

consisting of “three distinct phases,” which he illustrated as follows:!7”

1393.He further testified that “given the testimony we heard on Day 2 from Mr. Septilveda,
Reko Dig was--the Sponsors were, at that point here, right at the beginning of the process.
They had just engaged with lenders. They had not gone through any of the standard
review processes or the mandating of any of the lenders to actually structure the

transaction on their behalf.”!™

1394. With regard to the timing issue raised by Dr. Howden, the Tribunal agrees that the time
period it took for the Oyu Tolgoi project to finalize the structure of its debt financing
could indeed be considered significant in that it may indicate a potential significant delay
that the Reko Dig project could also have faced. However, the Tribunal also takes note of
Dr. Howden’s testimony that for the Oyu Tolgoi project, “the first phase was completely
funded by equity. The second phase was when the banks came in.”'™"* This indicates that
construction of the Oyu Tolgoi project could commence and proceed while the
negotiations on the debt financing were still ongoing. Also taking into account that Dr.
Howden considered it likely that the funding for Reko Diq would have had a similar
structure as Oyu Tolgoi, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to assume that ongoing
negotiations on the structure of the debt financing for Reko Diq would not have delayed
the project beyond the delays modeled by Prof. Davis as construction could have
commenced based on the 60% equity contribution by Claimant’s owners.

1395.In addition, the Tribunal also takes note of Mr. Pingle’s testimony at the Hearing on
Quantum that while the delay in finalizing the financing for Oyu Tolgoi was caused in
part by a change in the financing concept, he did not believe that the delays were caused
by financing issues but rather because certain financing commitments expired and had to

be re-established due to delays caused by other factors.'””° This testimony was not called
into question by Respondent or its experts. Taking into account that the delays modeled
by Prof. Davis, which were based on data for a considerable number of copper mines
around the world, the Tribunal has no basis to conclude that these delays did not also
account for the risk of delays in finalizing external debt financing.

1396.The Tribunal further does not consider it necessary to express an opinion on the

disagreement between Mr. Pingle and Dr. Howden as to the likeliness of commercial
lenders being involved as funders of ECA-insured loans rather than direct funding by the
ECAs themselves. There is no dispute that under either approach, the relevant risks of the
project would have been allocated to the ECAs and not the commercial banks. While Dr.
Howden placed emphasis on the fact that the likeliness of funding depended on the review
and approval by the credit committees of commercial banks, the Tribunal is not convinced
that the requirements would have been significantly different from those imposed by
ECAs giving direct loans. The real disagreement appears to be whether the ECAs and/or
a credit committee from a commercial bank would have shared the concerns raised by
Respondent’s experts on which Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden relied in their opinion.

1397. At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Howden referred to “a number of red flags” that “would

have potentially led to the transaction not being approved by the banks.” In this regard,
Dr. Howden referred to: (i) the “[a]vailability of water resources and rights &
transnational impacts”, (ii) “(lack of clear fiscal terms to determine cashflows” (iti)
“Ts]lecurity risks to pipeline from which revenues used to repay the debt come from”; and
(iv) “[slecurity of tenure risk due to lack of a mining lease.”!””° On that basis, Dr. Howden
concluded that “in our view, that would mean that at this point in time, given what the
Project was, that it was very unlikely that a credit committee of a mining finance bank
would actually approve a transaction to lend to the project.” He added that “in the current
form, the Project was not bankable, which would impact any quantification on the

value.!777

1398.In the Tribunal’s view, the “red flags’ identified by Dr. Howden show that his opinion

1776
77

was based on the one hand on the “as is” situation of the project in November 2011 in
which it did not have a mining lease and on the other hand on the assumption that the
water, environmental and security concerns raised by Respondent’s experts would have
been shared by lenders. As stated in their second report, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden
considered that “at the time in question, ... there were clear issues around technical
merits, fiscal regime, security, and water etc. that would have needed to be

comprehensively resolved in the eyes of diligent Mining Finance institutions before debt
could be advanced to Reko Dig,” referring in particular to environmental issues raised by

Ms. Filas and issues regarding the security of the project site and the pipeline.!7”*

1399.In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that it has addressed all of the aspects referred to by
Dr. Howden in detail above. In particular, the Tribunal was not convinced by Ms. Filas’
and Dr. Connor’s opinion that the ESIA failed to conform the Equator Principles and IFC
Performance Standards nor by their further criticisms regarding alleged environmental
and social impact issues that they considered to be insufficiently addressed in the ESIA.
As Ms. Cessford testified at the Hearing on Quantum, it was to be expected that potential
lenders would require certain additional work on the ESIA but the Tribunal sees no
indication based on its findings above that any of the alleged issues would have prevented
lenders from considering funding for the project.

1400. The Tribual has also concluded that none of the issues raised by Prof. Spiller or Dr. Nanni
would have affected the feasibility of Claimant’s plan for the supply of water for the
project. In addition, it concluded that while Claimant apparently did not account for
potential extra costs associated with having to implement an aquifer injection system to
mitigate possible drawdown effects into Afghanistan, these costs would not have affected
the value of the Reko Digq project from the perspective of a buyer in November 2011.
Consequently, even if lenders had required Claimant to include a cost estimate for this
mitigation measure, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would have been a “red flag”
preventing lenders from providing funding to the project.

1401.The Tribunal further concluded that Claimant’s security plans for the project’s central
facilities would have been considered adequate for a project at the development stage of
Reko Diq. With regard to the pipeline, the Tribunal also considered Claimant’s security
plan adequate for the development stage of the project and noted that if the risks turned
out to be higher than anticipated, Claimant would have been able to adapt its security plan
and react to the new level of threat. The Tribunal further maintained the conclusion it had
already drawn in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that not all risks could be fully
assessed and quantified at such an early stage and that the risk mitigation strategy would
evolve over time. This might also involve the development of additional security
measures following discussions with lenders but the Tribunal is not convinced that these
issues would have prevented lenders from considering funding for the project.

1402. As for the lack of clear fiscal terms, the Tribunal refers to its conclusion that in the absence
of Respondent’s Treaty breaches, a Mineral Agreement providing, inter alia, for fiscal
stability would have been concluded. In this regard, the Tribunal also recalls Mr. Pingle’s

"778 Henry/Howden IL, p. 17.

statement that the involvement of lenders such as ECAs and/or DFIs often facilitates the
conclusion of an agreement providing for fiscal stability with the host Government.!7”
Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden did not dispute that statement and the Tribunal therefore has
no basis to assume that the absence of a Mineral Agreement would have been considered
a “red flag” in that it would have prevented ECAs and DFIs from considering funding for
the project. This conclusion is also confirmed by Mr. Septilveda’s testimony regarding
the approach to obtaining project finance. In addition to the mining lease which he
described as the “main milestone,’ Mr. Septilveda explained that “with the banks,
especially--or probably the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the ECAs, [we]
form a team, and, together with these banks and the GoB, form a table with the GoP to

make progress in the Mineral Agreement. So, that was the strategy of the financing.”'"®°

1403.Finally, the Tribunal notes that the lack of tenure due to the absence of a mining lease

must be eliminated in the but-for scenario and is therefore irrelevant to the Tribunal’s
present assessment.

1404. On that basis, the Tribunal is not convinced that any of the “red flags” identified by Dr.

Howden would have led the relevant committees of ECAs, DFIs and/or commercial
lenders not to approve funding for the project.

1405. While this may not be sufficient in itself to draw the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the

relevant committees would in fact have approved funding for the project, the Tribunal
recalls that Claimant’s owners were contemplating to contribute 60% equity to the
project. Dr. Howden confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that this was “a significant
percentage.”'"*! He also confirmed that the amount of equity they are putting in would
be relevant to the lenders’ assessment but noted that “it’s a function of how much the
project can withstand.” He explained that “[i]f somebody is putting in more equity [than
in a typical project], it is either a function of the fact that the Project can’t support the 60
percent of the debt or they are prepared to provide more equity to make it more amenable
to the banks.”"7®

1406. While Dr. Howden’s testimony indicates that he considered the contribution of 60%

equity by the owners ambiguous in that it could also mean that the project would not be
economic if it had to take more than 40% debt, the Tribunal is not convinced that any
such indication would outweigh the obvious positive factors associated with this level of
commitment by the project sponsors. Mr. Pingle emphasized at the Hearing on Quantum
that, in his opinion, “the most important single issue in a project is the Sponsors, their

capability, their experience, and the amount of money they are committing.” Referring to
a usual range of 35% to 45% equity, Mr. Pingle considered that the commitment to

contribute 60% “demonstrates a high level of confidence in the Project.”'"*

1407.In his report, Mr. Pingle already stated that “[o]ver my entire 40+ year career, I have
never witnessed a project in which a sponsor was committing 60% of project costs as
equity, in excess of US$2.0 billion in cash, that failed to secure financing for technical
reasons or because the lenders’ engineer took issue with the project's technical work.”'74

1408.Mr. Pingle further explained what he considered to be important factors in limited
recourse project financing: (i) “[t]he identity of the project sponsors and their managerial,
technical and financial capability and experience with similar projects in comparable
locations’; (ii) “[t]he commitment of the project sponsors and their equity contribution,”
with mining projects typically requiring, in his experience, between 35% to 45% equity;
(ii) “[a] Feasibility Study that objectively and comprehensively confirms the Resource
quality, quantity, and ease of mining. Lenders will consider the quality of the development
program and the extensive analysis and confirmation work completed by internationally
recognized consulting firms that established the existence of the mineral deposit to be
mined”, and (iv) “[a] Financial Model that establishes that production can be produced
and sold under reasonable price scenarios likely to be encountered and that cash flows

are robust in the Base Case scenario.”'7*

1409. As pointed out by Mr. Pingle, Antofagasta was one of the ten largest copper miners in the
world as of the valuation date, operating four copper mines in the Atacama Desert in Chile
as well as managing a transportation network, a water purification and distribution
company and Antofagasta port. Barrick was the world’s largest gold producer as of the
valuation date, operating 26 mines in nine countries on five continents, including a mine
located in the Peruvian Andes and a mine in the Enga Province of Papua New Guinea.!7°°

Teams from both companies had been involved in the exploration work and the

preparation of the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which had cost

an amount of more than USD 240 million and were carried out with the assistance of
numerous independent and internationally recognized consultants. Antofagasta and

Barrick were further committed to contribute 60% of the total project costs, i.e., an

amount of over USD 2.3 billion, and would be seeking funding for the remaining 40%.

1410.In their second report, Mr. Henry and Dr. Howden dismissed the argument that Claimant
had the full support of its sponsors by arguing that “[h]istorical sunk expenditure on
exploration and feasibility work is irrelevant, with future sponsor commitment being more

of a concern for debt providers.” Specifically with regard to the contemplated
commitment of 60% equity, they considered that “[t]his point has no merit and goes
against the core discipline of limited recourse project finance which is standalone
assessment of the project to repay the debt, including mitigation of any risks to production
or sale of the commodity (i.e. technical risks, water risks and security).” Mr. Henry and
Dr. Howden then reiterated their arguments regarding the absence of a firm commitment
of the sponsors or an indication that the project was “next in line for development,”!787
which have already been addressed above.

1411.The Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Henry’s and Dr. Howden’s opinion. First, the
Tribunal does not accept the argument that the amounts invested by Antofagasta and
Barrick on the exploration work and preparation of the Studies would be considered
irrelevant in determining whether they were committed to the development of the project.
Sunk costs may be irrelevant to a DCF valuation, but they are evidence of the commitment
of the owners. In addition, and while agreeing with Respondent’s experts to the extent
that the future commitment of the sponsors may indeed be the more relevant aspect to
consider, it is not plausible that a commitment to contribute 60% equity would be
considered irrelevant by potential lenders due to the limited recourse nature of the
comtemplated financing.

1412.As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Feasibility Study explicitly
contemplated that Antofagasta and Barrick would have to “provide guarantees until the
project starts operations and reaches completion” and that it would then be “a long term
financing based upon the projected cash flows of the project during the operation phase
and after reaching completion, rather than upon the balance sheets of the sponsors.”'"°5
In any event, the Tribunal also does not accept the suggestion that a commitment to
contribute 60% equity to a project would be irrelevant even to limited recourse financing.
Even if the sponsors do not provide guarantees or other types of direct collateral to the
lenders, the fact that they are willing to commit more than USD 2 billion of their own
funds to the project and are thus very much interested in making this project a success,
will surely increase the level of confidence that a lender would have in the project.

1413.In these circumstances, the Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from its initial conclusion
that it is improbable that Antofagasta and Barrick would not have been able to obtain
third-party financing. Based on the evidence now in the record, the Tribunal is further
convinced that if the Mining Lease Application had been granted, Claimant and its owners
would have been able to obtain the contemplated project financing.

1414. In the Tribunal’s view, it is not necessary to make a finding as to the precise identity of
the lenders, including the question whether ECAs would have provided direct funding or
would have insured commercial loans as well as whether certain DFIs would also have
been part of the lender group. It is undisputed that the initial conversations with potential
lenders did not progress to a stage where specific lending terms were discussed.

1415.Specifically with regard to the Asian Development Bank, Mr. Luksic testified that they
“were discussing just the principal ideas and their appetite and the possibility of them
joining us in this Project. And my recollection is that they were very positive about it.”'®?
Mr. Septilveda also testified that while there were “recurrent conversations” with banks
with whom they had relationships, such as “with Japanese banks, with French banks, ...
with China Development Bank, ... with Citibank, Standard Charter, American banks

also,” “the main conclusion was, first, obtain the Mining Lease, and then go and get
financing.”'”° He further confirmed that “[w]e didn’t talk about the rates. What we
discussed was about who would be the lenders, and what would be the strategy to

approach the lenders.”'"!

1416.On that basis, the Tribunal considers it undisputed that as of the valuation date, it was not
yet clear from which lenders and at which cost Claimant would obtain financing for the
40% debt portion. As confirmed by Mr. Luksic, the loan terms underlying the financial
analysis in the Feasibility Study were an estimate of what they considered to be
reasonable terms of financing at the time.

1417.The question for the Tribunal to address is therefore whether the remaining uncertainty
as to the actual costs of debt financing were adequately accounted for by Prof. Davis in
his valuation model. As noted above, Prof. Davis explained in his first report that due to
the uncertainties regarding external debt financing, his valuation assumed all equity
financing. In his opinion, this assumption was conservative as external borrowing would

have resulted in interest tax deductions and thereby increased the project’s value.'7

1418.Neither Respondent nor its experts disputed the statement that assuming all equity
financing resulted in higher costs than assuming 40% debt financing. In particular, there
has been no allegation that the cost of obtaining debt financing from ECAs and/or DFIs
and/or commercial banks insured by ECAs would have been higher than the cost of equity
applied by Prof. Davis. To the contrary, Respondent asked Mr. Septilveda to confirm at
the Hearing on Quantum that “as a matter of corporate finance, the Cost of Equity is

higher than the Cost of Financing” to which Mr. Septilveda responded that “[i]t usually

is, yes” and confirmed that he did not think that this case would be an exception.'7*

1419.In the absence of any dispute that the costs for all equity financing as assumed by Prof.

Davis were higher than the costs for the contemplated combined equity and external debt
financing, it is also apparent that any external debt financing obtained by Claimant and
its owners would only have served to decrease but not to increase the costs assumed by
Prof. Davis in his model. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it
necessary to make a finding as to the likely actual costs of the debt financing because the
remaining uncertainty regarding these costs has been sufficiently accounted for by Prof.
Davis’ assumption of all equity financing.

1420. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has established that it could have

10.

obtained the necessary financing for the project and that Prof. Davis has adequately
accounted for the associated with financing, including the uncertainty as to the precise
identity of the lenders and the terms at which they would provide funding to the project.

Conclusion

1421.For the reasons set out in detail above and based on its review and evaluation of the

1793

evidentiary record, the Tribunal considers it established that Claimant would have
concluded a Mineral Agreement with the Federal and Provincial Governments, and
further that Claimant has established the feasibility and financeability of the project. In
particular, the Tribunal made the following findings:

1) Mineral Agreement and fiscal terms: Claimant would most likely have reached
agreement with the Governments on the terms of the Mineral Agreement, but
these terms would have differed to a certain extent from the terms assumed by
Prof. Davis in his main valuation. Specifically, the terms would most likely have
included: (i) a sliding scale of royalties increasing from 2.5% to 4% over the life
of the mine, thereby reducing Claimant’s damages by USD 287 million; and (ii)
a provision regarding the renewal of the Mining Lease; however, a buyer would
have factored in the risk that the Mining Lease might not be renewed or might not
be renewed on the same terms, thereby reducing Claimant’s damages by a further
USD 744.5 million.

2

Estimation and classification of resources: Claimant has established that the
estimation and classification of the resources reported in the Feasibility Study,
which formed the basis for Prof. Davis’ valuation of Claimant’s damage, is in
accordance with industry practice and corresponded to an exercise of “good
judgment” by the relevant Competent Persons within Barrick and Antofagasta

who adopted and implemented the method, which Mr. Rossi had proposed upon
his review of the methods previously applied by Claimant’s two owners in March
2009.

Metallurgical sampling and testing: Claimant has established that the
metallurgical sampling was adequate and in line with industry standards. The
Tribunal further has no reason to believe that the metallurgical testing conducted
by AMMTEC was inadequate or that such tests showed variability that would
have affected the value attributed by a willing buyer to Claimant’s investment.

Project execution: The Tribunal has no reason to believe that Claimant’s plans for
executing the project and the capital cost estimate, as adjusted by Prof. Davis,
would have been considered inadequate by a buyer in November 2011.

Water supply: Claimant has established that none of the issues raised by
Respondent would have affected the feasibility of Claimant’s plan for the supply
of water to the project. While it appears to the Tribunal that Claimant has not
accounted for the potential extra costs associated with having to implement an
aquifer injection system to mitigate possible drawdown effects into Afghanistan,
the Tribunal does not consider that this would have affected the value of the Reko
Digq project from the perspective of a buyer in November 2011.

Security risks: Claimant has established that its security plans for the project
would have been considered adequate for a project at the development stage of
Reko Dig and that, if particularly the risks affecting the pipeline turned out to be
higher than anticipated, Claimant would have been able to adapt its security plan
and react to the new level of threat. However, the Tribunal concluded that in order
to adequately capture the residual risk caused by political violence, a buyer would
have applied a higher annual probability of permanent shutdown than assumed by
Prof. Davis in his valuation model, thereby reducing Claimant’s damages by
USD 711.5 million.

Environmental and social impacts: Claimant has established that it adequately
addressed the environmental and social impacts of the project. The Tribunal is not
convinced that any of the alleged non-conformities of the ESIA with the relevant
environmental standards and regulatory requirements would have caused
significant additional work and/or costs for which Claimant should have
accounted in the cost estimate of the Feasibility Study. The Tribunal also has no
basis to assume that a lender would have considered the cost that Claimant
contemplated to spend on the community programs it had described insufficient.
However, Claimant itself based its submission regarding the amounts it intended
to spend for community programs on a revised offer of 4 October 2010 which
included certain additional community initiatives beyond the costs reflected in the

Feasibility Study and Prof. Davis’ model, which reduces Claimant’s damages by
USD 100 million.

Permits and land rights: Claimant has established that the delays modeled by Prof.
Davis in his valuation to account for potential difficulties in obtaining relevant
permits and/or land rights would have been considered sufficient by a buyer as of
the valuation date.

Financing: Claimant has established that it could have obtained the necessary
financing for the project. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that Claimant’s
owners would have been willing and able to contribute the contemplated amount
of equity funding to the project and that, if the Mining Lease Application had been
granted, Claimant and its owners would have been able to obtain the contemplated
project financing for the remaining portion of the project costs. While it was not
yet certain which lenders would provide funding and at what terms, Prof. Davis
has adequately accounted for this uncertainty by assuming the higher costs of all
equity financing.

1422.On that basis, the Tribunal concludes that in order to account for the risks and concerns

D.

addressed in detail above, Claimant’s damages must be reduced by an amount of
USD 1,843 million.

Value of Claimant’s Investment

1423. Having assessed the risks and issues raised by Respondent regarding the feasibility and

profitability of the project, the Tribunal will now assess whether Prof. Davis has

appropriately accounted for all relevant systematic and asymmetric risks of the project.

1424. Certain asymmetric risks, such as the risk of an early shut-down of the mine or delays in

1.

commencing construction and operations of the mine, have already been addressed in

detail above. However, the Tribunal still has to assess whether Prof. Davis has

appropriately addressed the systematic risk arising from, in particular, the fluctuation of

prices for gold, copper and oil. More generally, the Tribunal will also address the question

whether Claimant has established that Prof. Davis has accounted for all relevant

systematic and asymmetric risks in his projection of future cash flows, including country

risk, thereby justifying a risk-free discount rate which only accounts for the time value of

money, or whether certain additional adjustments are warranted to fully capture the risks

of the project as of November 2011.

Summary of Claimant’s Position

1425.Claimant submits that Prof. Davis appropriately discounted the project’s future cash flows

for both systematic and asymmetric risks as well as for the time value of money. As for

systematic risk, Claimant explains that Prof. Davis applied risk-adjusted cash flows

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -471-

derived from futures and forward prices; it argues that “[b]ecause buyers in the forward
market are exposed to systematic risk, the prices in futures contracts are already
discounted for systematic risk.”'7+

1426.Claimant rejects Respondent’s allegation that the cash flows in Prof. Davis’ model are
the same as the cash flows in the DCF model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.
Claimant refers to Prof. Davis who testified that there are “clear and large differences”
between the copper and gold revenues in the two models and demonstrated that the capital
costs in his model are approximately 40% higher than in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study.!7

1427. According to Claimant, Respondent’s experts, for the purposes of their comparison,
“arbitrarily reduced the EXP Pre-Feasibility Study prices by 20% below the base
assumption,” initially without providing any explanation. As for the explanation provided
by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells in their second report that the change was “a short cut
to compensate for the fact that real output prices in the SNC-Lavalin [scenario] are indeed
higher than those of Brattle and the former does not include the government equity take
and risk adjustments,” Claimant considers that it “makes no sense” as the government
equity take could have been accounted for by taking 75% of each year’s cash flows. In
addition, Claimant contends that their reference to higher “real output prices” in fact

demonstrates that Prof. Davis indeed used risk-adjusted prices. '7°°

1428. Claimant also rejects Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ argument that they “normalized”
the model in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, noting that Mr. Brailovsky
acknowledged at the Hearing on Quantum that there was initially an average difference
of USD 3.8 billion in gross revenues, which he “assumed away by setting the prices equal
to each other.” According to Claimant, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells thereby
effectively assumed away the systematic risk discount applied by Prof. Davis; they also
admitted that they were not trying to test with that exercise whether Prof. Davis’ figures
were discounted for systematic risk.'7°7

1429.In any event, Claimant considers that the “normalized” model still “differs significantly”
from Prof. Davis’ model, as demonstrated by the table presented by Mr. Brailovksy and
Prof. Wells in their second report. According to Claimant, the copper and gold revenues
are “radically different between the models, with the copper revenues nearly 40% higher

and the gold revenue more than 50% lower in the ‘normalized’ model.” Claimant also
points to the expenditure estimates which “vary widely, with around 10% higher Opex
estimates and 27% lower Capex estimates in the ‘normalized’ model.”'78 Tn addition,
Claimant notes that by contrast to Prof. Davis, Respondent’s experts did not update the
Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study model, which dated from June 2010, to the valuation
date even though Prof. Wells conceded that the prices and price expectations “were quite
materially different.” They also did not contest that Prof. Davis’ approach to updating the
model was appropriate, which shows an “even greater” difference in cash flows between

the updated model and Prof. Davis’ risk-adjusted cash flows.'7”

1430.Claimant emphasizes that contrary to Mr. Brailovsky’s suggestion at the Hearing on
Quantum, Prof. Davis did not apply in his update the spot prices on the valuation date but
rather the (lower) average of the price projections used by mining companies in publicly

available reports at the time.'*°°

1431.Claimant further rejects the allegation that Prof. Davis’ model implies a 4.2% discount
rate, which would be only 1.2 percentage points above the risk-free rate. According to
Claimant, Respondent’s experts in their reverse engineering exercise fail to back out even
some of the significant asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis, such as the
risks of cost overruns and ramp-up delay. Claimant contends that accurately backing out
these risks would produce a higher a discount rate but argues that in any event,
Respondent has not provided any basis for its claim that 4.2% is a low number for

discount-rate equivalents of asymmetric risks in mining projects.'*°!

1432. More importantly, Claimant contends that Mr. Brailovky’s and Prof. Wells’ exercise does
not quantify the discount for systematic risk, which Prof. Davis discounted separately
from asymmetric risk. Claimant refers to Prof. Davis’ explanation that backing out
systematic risk would lead to a still higher discount rate but that it “is not possible reliably
to derive this missing figure” due to the difficulties in attempting to “estimate the actual
spot prices for copper, gold, and oil that the project would be exposed to.” Claimant
further quotes from Prof. Davis’ explanation that this is “[o]ne of the reasons that this

modern approach has gained traction and is demanded by industry ... because it obviates

the need to calculate that unknowable number.”!8

1433. As a result, Claimant claims that Respondent’s experts cannot calcute an implied discount
rate for Prof. Davis’ valuation. Claimant maintains, however, that the discount for
systematic risk “is likely to be significant” as it encompasses the risks regarding price
fluctuations, with a “massive” range of variability around the prices for copper, gold and

oil, 803

1434. Claimant further submits that Prof. Davis’ approach of using risk-adjusted prices from
the futures and forward markets is appropriate and fully accounts for the systematic risk
of the project arising from its exposure to price uncertainty. Claimant emphasizes that
Prof. Davis has not modeled what actual future prices are likely to be but rather what
future prices are likely to be on a risk-adjusted basis and adds that forward market prices
“are the market’s actual risk-adjusted expectations of what future prices will be.” It
argues that “[t]he market prices combine the market’s average price expectation with the
market’s pricing of the associated uncertainty, creating a reliable and market-based way
to account for systematic risk.” Claimant refers to Prof. Davis’ explanation that the use
of risk-adjusted prices is “[o]ne of the core advantages of the modern DCF method” as it
eliminates the need to forecast spot commodity prices and enables him to use prices that
are “directly observable in the futures market for shorter maturities and can be estimated

using accepted models for longer maturities.”'*°*

1435. According to Claimant, the fact that futures prices incorporate systemic risk is supported
by the academic literature and was also accepted by Prof. Wells, at least for oil, at the
Hearing on Quantum. Claimant contends that using forward prices is also an accepted
practice for valuation in the mining industry and refers to a report from CIMVal in 2012
that “in appropriate circumstances a commodity price forecast may be derived from its
forward price curve” as the “forward price is considered a risk-adjusted expected

price.?!805

1436.Claimant submits that Prof. Davis’ approach is consistent with industry practice and
explains that for gold, he used futures prices and quotes on forward markets for the first
ten years and then extended the prices out by using formulas derived from the market data
together with statistical computations to simulate “the wide range of potential future price

scenarios.”'®°® Claimant emphasizes that Prof. Davis did not model a fixed or “static”
projected price at each point in the future but rather took a probabilistic approach,
modelling a range of prices that might occur at each future point in time. Claimant notes
that Respondent’s experts agreed with taking a probabilistic approach and raised only

very narrow criticisms, focusing on Prof. Davis’ modeling of risk-adjusted gold prices. '8°7

1437.As for the argument raised in Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ first report that it was
inappropriate to rely on forward market prices because Claimant could not have sold its
entire expected production into the market, Claimant emphasizes that such an assumption
does not form part of Prof. Davis’ model which rather simulates sales of the mine’s output
in the future over the life of the mine “under a wide range of potential scenarios for what
the prices in those future years might be.” Claimant explains that the risk-adjustment in
Prof. Davis’ prices is not derived from prices being locked in through actual forward
market transactions but rather from the fact that they “reflect[] both the market’s
forecasted price of copper and the market's risk preferences over the uncertainty in that
forecast,” revealing “the net result of these two items, the risk-adjusted forecasted

price,?!808

1438.Claimant further rejects the argument raised by Respondent’s experts that Prof. Davis
should have used analysts’ predictions for the gold price (but not the copper price),
emphasizing that analysts do not forecast risk-adjusted prices or the average or expected
value at particular future times and maintaining that “market prices are the best, and
indeed only options for risk-adjusted prices.”'®® In addition, Claimant claims that analyst
forecasts are “materially inaccurate” and refers to Prof. Davis’ illustration of the fact that
the Consensus Economics forecast relied on by Respondent’s experts consistently under-
predicted actual future gold prices when the market was rising; they also over-predicted
prices when the market was falling. Claimant also refers to Prof. Davis’ testimony that

 

analyst prices “are not even traded prices. ... They are just projections of something, and

we are not sure what they are” and that he was not sure who relied on them and for what
purpose. According to Claimant, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells also offered
contradicting testimony on which prices the forecasts actually predict.'*'° It therefore
maintains that “[t]he pricing of actual forward transactions by market participants with

billions of dollars at stake provides a much more reliable indication of market
participants’ actual risk-adjusted expectations of future prices than analysts’

predictions.”'8"!

1439. Claimant also rejects the criticisms regarding Prof. Davis’ use of forward curves to extend
the price forecasts into the future, arguing that “forward prices are the most accurate
indiciation of risk-adjusted future price expectations” as they “show the market’s actual
consensus risk-adjusted price expectations of what future prices will be.” In Claimant’s
view, the existence of gold arbitrage also does not render it inappropriate to use gold
forward prices given that Respondent’s experts acknowledged that “gold behaves like a
currency in the forward markets” and investors therefore expect it to at least hold its value
in real terms, resulting in a rise in nominal terms. Claimant notes that CIMVal also reports
about “concerns about liquidity, incomplete forward curves, or the observation that a
forward price is a mathematical calculation” but adds that “these reasons do not prevent

the use of forward curves in generating a price forecast.”'8!

1440.Claimant further considers that Prof. Wells backed away from his previous concern
whether there was sufficient liquidity for futures markets to show market expectations,
testifying that “there always is” liquidity four years out in the gold futures market and
acknowledging that on the valuation date, the gold future price four years out was
supported by USD 1.5 billion in the market.!*!*

1441.Claimant contends that Prof. Davis’ method of extending out the forward curve by
applying an algorithm to the forward prices, which are based on market activity up to ten
years out, followed recognized practices in the mining industry. It quotes from CIMVal’s
conclusion that “[mlJetal price forecasts based on the forward curve may be extended
beyond the publicly quoted prices based on the characteristics of the metal (base metal

or precious metal) and the market characteristics of the forward curve.”'®'+

1442. Specifically with regard to the projection of the gold price, Claimant emphasizes that Mr.
Brailovsky and Prof. Wells recognize that “gold behaves like a currency in the forward
markets” and adds that the gold price does not rise or fall with industry demand or
expectations of global growth but that gold is rather used as a hedge against inflation and
expected to hold its value in real terms. Claimant then refers to Prof. Davis’ illustration
that in real terms, his price projects are nearly flat, and notes that the nominal annual

compound growth rate of 3% assumed by Prof. Davis is “far lower than the 8% historical

annual compound growth from 1970 through the valuation date.” '8'°

1443. Claimant notes that Respondent’s experts explicitly acknowledged in their first report that
the gold price is not mean-reverting but rather “varies as a random walk process with a
drift”; in their second report, however, they came up with a statistical test to confirm the
opposite. Claimant requests that this test be disregarded as untimely because it prevented
Prof. Davis from being able to properly respond; in any event, it should be given no
weight due to its underdevelopment and substantive flaws. Claimant contends that
Respondent’s experts first relied on the wrong statistical test, i.e., a “standard t-test,” even
though the very textbook they rely on notes that “one cannot use a standard t-test to
determine whether the estimate of N is significantly different from zero.”'*'© Claimant
notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells appear to acknowledge that error by performing
the correct unit root test recommended by their own source in an excel sheet introduced
at the Hearing on Quantum and claims that the test, albeit not effective with only 30 to
AO years of data, yields the opposite conclusion from the one stated in their second report,

namely that it cannot be rejected statistically that gold prices are not mean-reverting.'*!7

1444. Claimant further considers it “common sense” that gold prices are not mean-reverting and
refers to Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ illustration of their alleged mean-reverting
price against the upward slope of the historical gold spot price. In Claimant’s view, there
is not “a shred of evidence” to support Respondent’s allegation that gold will start to

behave “fundamentally different in the future than it has for generations.” '*!8

1445.As for Prof. Davis’ modelling of risk-adjusted copper prices, Claimant notes that he
projects them to “drop[] steadily over the life of the mine” to a price “far below the lowest
inflation-adjusted price of copper in the past 60 years.” In Claimant’s view, “[t]his is
consistent with copper forward prices showing the combined effects of the market’s
expectations for what prices will be, on average, at future times and the market’s pricing
of systematic risk.” Claimant adds that this downward trend is also consistent with copper
being a commodity rather than an investment asset like gold. It emphasizes that Reko Diq
contains far more copper than gold and argues that Prof. Davis’ copper price projection
confirms that he did not use inflated pricec projections to create an artificially high

value. !8!9

1446. Claimant also rejects the argument that it was inconsistent for Prof. Davis not to rely on
forward market prices to also model the costs of the project. Claimant argues that reliable
forward market prices exist only for fuel but not for other cost items such as equipment
and labor as well as other capital and operating expenditures. According to Claimant,
Prof. Davis therefore relied on “the same uncontroversial techniques that are regularly
used in traditional DCF analyses” when there is no appropriate forward market data. He
used Claimant’s “detailed mine plans’ as a starting point but then adjusted the costs
upwards to account for inflation, cost escalation and asymmetric risk.'*?°

1447.Claimant agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that together with the increase of
metals prices between the Feasibility Study and the valuation date, costs also increased
and submits that Prof. Davis therefore adjusted costs upward by 18% based on an updated
capital costs schedule prepared by Barrick. Claimant notes that together with the
adjustments for cost escalation, inflation and asymmetric risk, Prof. Davis increased costs
by a total of 58% and thus by more than the “up to 50%” that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof.

Wells referred to in their first report.!*?!

1448. With regard to the volatility of capital costs, Claimant submits that Prof. Davis initially
did not include variability of capital costs into his model “[t]o avoid needless complexity”
as he did not expect such an adjustment to have a significant effect; however, following
the criticism of Respondent’s experts, he did perform such a test and concluded that
incorporating cost variability has a “negligible effect.”'*** Specifically, Prof. Davis
concluded that randomizing capital costs would change his valuation estimate by

approximately 1.5%.!*?5

1449. Claimant also notes that the capital costs modeled by Prof. Davis were 58% higher in
nominal terms and 33% higher in real terms than the capital costs in Claimant’s feasibility
studies. In Claimant’s view, there is therefore no basis for Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof.
Wells’ argument that Prof. Davis should have used a higher probability distribution mean
in order to account for average cost overruns of 25%, which would result in double-
counting the risk already included in Prof. Davis’ modeling of the capital costs

themselves. '8*4

1450. Claimant further submits that Prof. Davis has also fully accounted for asymmetric risks,

including the country risk affecting the project because of its location in Pakistan and in
particular Balochistan. !*5

1451.Claimant notes that on Respondent’s own case, the most prominent risks associated with
the project’s location are political violence and security risks. It refers to Prof. Davis’

explanation that the proper way to account for these and other asymmetric risks is “to
directly adjust the cash flow components affected by these risks.” !°*6

1452.Claimant contends that Respondent and its experts have not identified any security risks
or potential security costs that Prof. Davis failed to account for in his model, rejecting in
particular the argument that he did not account for the risks identified in Claimant’s risk
register.'®?? According to Claimant, Prof. Davis modeled and quantified several country-
related risks identified by Claimant in its risk register, such as “[c]riminal extortion &
kidnap caused by criminal groups,” “(theft of explosives & blasting accessories,”

“Ts]abotage of [e]quipment & [s]tructures,”’ and “[mlilitary operations against the

Taliban in Afghanistan Helmand province spilling over.”!®*8

1453.Claimant argues that Prof. Davis took these security risks into account in three ways: (i)
he incorporated an annual 0.5% probability of a complete and permanent project
shutdown which reduced the value of Claimant’s investment by USD 1.4 billion and, in
Claimant’s view, is “an extremely conservative assumption” ;!8°° (ii) he included
“substantial premiums for insurance that would protect against the effects of political

violence, terrorist attacks, and other security threats,” covering business interruptions of

1830

more than 30 days and totaling nearly USD 9 million per year; and (iii) he adjusted

various costs and production quantities to reflect the residual risk of various security

threats, which in total reduced the projected cash flows by USD 13.9 million per year for

the first five years and USD 5.7 million per year thereafter.'**!

1454. Claimant rejects the argument that the annual probability of an early shutdown is too low

and notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells do not provide any analysis or suggestion

1832

how the security risks should have been modeled instea Claimant also maintains that

Dr. Burrows’ suggestion that it should use a discount rate based on Pakistan’s sovereign
yield spread is “invalid and does not provide any basis to question Prof. Davis’s treatment
of country risk’; the same applies to his belated reliance on a regression analysis

performed by Dr. Bekaert, which does not work for Pakistan.'**

1455. Finally, Claimant maintains that the additional security costs proposed by Respondent’s

expert Mr. Davies would not have been necessary but notes that, in any event, factoring
them in would reduce the project’s value only by USD 370 million. As Prof. Davis did
not reduce the premature shutdown risk in this sensitivity calculation, he concluded that
the potential effect on value of the security threats identified by Respondent’s experts

have already been taken into account in his model.'**+

1456.In addition to country risk, Claimant asserts that Prof. Davis also accounted for further

2.

asymmetric risk by incorporating the potential effects of project delays. Specifically,
Claimant argues that he included a delay of at least six months before start of construction
in each of his simulations and assumed that construction would, on average, start 2.3 years
after Claimant had anticipated, which reduced the value of Claimant’s investment by
USD 1.3 billion. '835

Summary of Respondent’s Position

1457.Respondent takes the position that Prof. Davis has not adequately accounted for the

systematic risks in his valuation model because he has used “inordinately speculative”

projections of futures prices. !*°°

1458. Respondent notes that Claimant’s expert purported to apply prices for the futures markets

1833
1834

and even called his projections “certainty-equivalent”. To the contrary, however,
Respondent refers to its experts who explained that “futures’ markets are not the best
predictors of prices, and the valuation best practices would have been to rely on the price
forecasts by the community of experts and entities active in the field, which are blended
into consensus forecasts.” Respondent claims that these forecasts “are followed by the
industry in their estimations of future prices” and would “without doubt have been the
basis on which the hypothetical buyer and seller would have based their price forecasts,”
as Claimant and its shareholders did in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study and their

annual reports.'8*7

1459.Respondent emphasizes that the time horizon of transactions in the futures markets is
much shorter than the mining activities under valuation and claims that the prices applied
by Claimant’s expert are in fact admittedly “projections created ad-hoc by those same
TCC experts,” including “a bizarre gold price projection, which literally spikes off the
graph, and ends up being 12 times the consensus price.”'*** Respondent refers to its
experts who state that “the futures prices used by Brattle are neither market determined
nor the best forecasts of prices in the future, let alone certainty-equivalent” and add that,
in their opinion, “no one can take Brattle’s reports seriously when its author believes that
the ‘certainty-equivalent’ cash flows that he calculates for Reko Dig are as safe as the
cash flows from a U.S. Treasury bond of equal duration, and that therefore both have to

be discounted at the risk-free rate.”!*°°

1460.Respondent further relies on Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ statement that
“Claimant’s damages vanish when one uses Consensus Economics price projections
instead of futures-based prices, with no other changes in the Brattle model. Brattle relies
on futures prices that are neither market determined nor the best source available for
price forecasts.”'*° Respondent submits that if the prices crafted by Prof. Davis are
replaced with the more reliable expert consensus forecasts for gold, copper and oil, the
average net present value of Claimant’s investment would be negative, i.e., USD -1.23
billion, and the project would generate a negative rate of return and thus no profits.'**!

Respondent argues that the fact that Prof. Davis prices which “presumably contain all

sorts of risks” are higher than the prices predicted by forecasts further confirms the

irrationality of his analysis. '*47

1461.Respondent also contends that Prof. Davis’ modeling of the costs of the project contained
“myriad, unresolved and fatal errors” which were revealed at the Hearing on Quantum
when Claimant introduced a new set of spreadsheets which included expenditures that
had increased by approximately USD 1 billion.'*** In addition, Respondent notes that by

assuming all equity financing, Prof. Davis failed to account for the amortization or interest

of financing in the project costs.!*4

1462.In Respondent’s view, Prof. Davis’ valuation is based on the proposition that its “modern”
cash flows contain the same amount of risk as cash flows derived from a US Treasury
bond both of which should then be discounted at the risk-free rate of return. Respondent

considers it “simply untenable” that a buyer would be convinced by Prof. Davis’
explanation of “certainty-equivalent” cash flows and accept the “ridiculously low rate
return” in order to invest in a non-diversified, non-operational mining project in

Balochistan instead of purchasing the same amout in US Treasury bonds. '*4°

1463.In any event, Respondent contends that Prof. Davis admitted at the Hearing on Quantum
that he had not fully de-risked the cash flows in his model when stating that “very clearly

. when the Buyer buys this for $8.5 billion, they do not get a bond. They get the cash

flows up at the top right that are highly uncertain and highly risky.” Respondent considers

that this admission precludes the reliance on the “‘de-risked” approach yield a certainty-

equivalent fair market value of USD 8.5 billion.'*°

1464.Respondent contends that “[w]hen properly analyzed,” Prof. Davis’ valuation is
equivalent to applying a discount rate of merely 1.2% above the risk-free rate; “a
preposterous proposition,” taking into account that market expectations for Pakistan were
at least 9 times higher than that and the risks in Balochistan were even higher. According
to Respondent, Claimant has thereby ignored over 90% of the risk impact perceived by
financial markets and institutions.'*” Respondent also refers to the discount rate of 23%
calculated by Dr. Burrows as well as the discount rates of 10% to 12% used by SNC
Lavalin in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which led to a value of the project near

zero, 1848

1465. Respondent further argues that the implied discount rate is only “about half of what would
be appropriate for this type of project if it was located in an advanced economy” but
reveals that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis “were not even close to being
appropriate for valuing a project of this type in Balochistan, much less a project that had
no track record.” Specifically, Respondent refers to: (i) the “speculative” purchase of
Reko Dig by Claimant’s shareholders in 2006; (ii) Prof. Davis’ “scattered and piecemeal

enumeration of the value assigned to the few risks actually incorporated into the cash
flows,” which Respondent claims to be incorrect as “[w]hen analyzed systematically,” the
amount of adjustments is “much smaller than claimed by Claimant’s valuators’, (iii) the
“risk component” captured in Prof. Davis’ cash flows which adds only about 1.4% to the
risk-free discount rate, which Respondent considers “extremely, unexplainably low” and
a sign of Prof. Davis’ omission of country risk; (iv) the underestimation of the impact of
early termination due to “extreme political violence or government action”, and (v) the
fact that the results of applying the same discount rate to the cash flows in the Expansion
Pre-Feasibility Study and Prof. Davis’ model are “practically indistinguishable from each
other’ which confirms in its view that Prof. Davis has failed to account “in any

meaningful way for the risks in the cash flows.” *4°

1466.Specifically with regard to the discount rate before Prof. Davis’ risk adjustments,
Respondent maintains that any buyer of Reko Diq would have considered to apply this
rate because, as explained by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, "[i]n real life investors
want to know the discount rate used to evaluate the actual cash flows; telling them that it
is the risk-free rate, which of course they can consult directly, is not of much use.” They
further opined that “the equivalence would reveal the IRR before Brattle’s risk
adjustments, which is the overall profitability expected from the project, again a crucial
variable that any investor in the real world would want to know before embarking in it.”

Respondent notes that Prof. Davis has not provided this information. '*°°

1467.In addition, Respondent contends that it is a “methodological charade” to suggest that
Prof. Davis has accounted for all risks at source given that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells
revealed that the “traditional” DCF calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study,
“once adjusted to describe the same universe of facts,” yields a similar pattern of results,
which makes it impossible to argue that one has been “de-risked” and the other has not.
Respondent quotes from its experts that “[t]he most plausible explanation is that the two
models are in reality neither independent nor conceptually different from each other, and
since the SNC-Lavalin model—which never pretended to be a ‘modern’ DCF with
‘certainty equivalent’ prices—precedes Brattle’s, it is the latter that seems to be a close
replica of the former.”'*! Respondent further refers to their opinion that Claimant
“applies a risk-free interest rate to those practically unadjusted cash flows to arrive at

$8.5 billion, when practically the same cash flows yield no value in the SNC-Lavalin
[EXP-PFS].”!852

1468. Respondent argues that, as confirmed by the IFRS, the traditional DCF calculation should
produce the exact same result as the “certainty-equivalent” DCF method; Prof. Davis also
acknowledged that both methods “produce an estimate of this FMV, they just come to
that FMV via different approaches to discounting for systematic risk.”'*>? Respondent
refers to its experts who explain that in order to obtain the certainty-equivalent cash flows,
they must be discounted by “the risk adjustment rate, which is the difference between the
discount rate and the risk-free rate” and that it should thereby be possible to derive a
strict equivalent to the traditional DCF calculation. Respondent notes that Prof. Davis has

not provided such a calculation. !**+

1469. Respondent concludes that given the similarity between the revenues and costs projected
in both models, it is apparent that Prof. Davis made “only minor adjustments to the cash
flows” which, “when aggregated, are a very small part of the overall revenues and
expenditures,” and that these cash flows are therefore no more “‘certainty-equivalent” than
those of SNC Lavalin. As a result, Respondent claims that there can be no justification
for the application of risk-free discount rate to the cash flows in Prof. Davis’ model.!*°5

1470. Specifically, with regard to country risk, Respondent submits that Claimant failed to
properly account for this type of risk which, according to Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells,
is “one of the most significant factors underlying the low risk implicit in Brattle’s
calculation.” In their opinion, “[i]t defies credulity that 1.2%—the risk premium implicitly
contemplated in Brattle’s report—is enough to account for the enormous risks facing a
mining project in Balochistan.”'*** Therefore, Respondent also rejects the argument that
its experts would double count the value impact of country risk, quoting from Mr.
Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ statement that “[o]ne cannot double count risks when

almost none are accounted for in the first place.”!**"

1471.Respondent submits that country risk can cause significant uncertainty regarding an
investment’s returns, due to macroeconomic, political and environmental factors and
considers it “indisputable that the country risk must be considered independently of the

proposed valuation approach.”!*°* Respondent argues that investment treaty tribunals
“have consistently and uncontroversially recognized the necessity to apply country risk”
and quotes from a scholarly commentary stating that “[i]rrespective of the approach, in
assessing value the expert must account for the relevant risks attached to the asset in

question, including relevant country risk.”'*°?

1472. Respondent notes that Mr. Luksic testified at the Hearing on Quantum that a discount rate
of 12% would be considered conservative: in its view, the same applies to the country
risk rate of 12.1% based on Pakistan’s sovereign yield spread in 201 1.'$® In Respondent’s
view, it therefore defies reason to assume that the implied discount rate of 4.2% in Prof.
Davis’ model would be an adequate expression of all the risks to which the project’s cash
flows would have been exposed. Respondent refers to various recent decisions in which
the tribunals determined damages based on forward-looking projections of income and
found that country risk premiums between 10% and 20% should be included in the
discount rate. Respondent notes that applying any of those discount rates would render
the net present value of the cash flows estimated by Claimant negative. As stated by Mr.
Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, “any discount rate that includes country risk is far above the

rates that make the NPV zero or less in all these calculations.”'°!

1473. According to Respondent, Prof. Davis’ application of a risk-free discount rate is directly
contradicted by the reasoning of the tribunal in OJ European v. Venezuela as to why an

investment in Venezuela justified a higher premium than if the same investment had been

made in Italy.!8°

1474. Respondent emphasizes that, in its view, there is no economic or legal reason not to apply
a discount rate incorporating country risk, as a buyer would have done when making its
decision whether to invest in Reko Dig. According to Respondent, Prof. Davis failed to
contemplate possible changes in the fiscal regime, which would be “perfectly legal for a
sovereign State to do.” Respondent also refers to political unrest and terrorism affecting

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

1475. At the outset of its analysis of whether Claimant’s expert Prof. Davis has appropriately
accounted for all systematic and asymmetric risks affecting the project, the Tribunal
recalls that it has found above that it is appropriate to value Claimant’s investment based
on the modern DCF method applied by Prof. Davis and, in that context, has already made
certain findings which will again be relevant in the present analysis.

1476. Based on its review of the evidentiary record regarding the modern DCF method, the
Tribunal found that it makes sense in the present valuation of Claimant’s investment to
distinguish between different types of risk in the valuation and to adjust each cash flow
component directly for the risks that affect this particular cash flow. In particular taking
into account the information provided by CIMVal in 2012 about valuation practices in
the mining industry, the Tribunal noted that uncertainties associated with the modern
DCF approach, e.g., regarding the projection of future metals prices, do not justify
rejecting this method or the use of risk-adjusted prices; they are controllable by making
reasonable, and perhaps conservative, assumptions. The Tribunal agreed with Claimant
that in the present case, this approach is preferable to applying a traditional DCF method
with a discount rate that results in almost no net present value for cash flows that would
be generated in the second half of the mine’s life.

1477.The Tribunal has not yet assessed whether Prof. Davis has used reasonable inputs to
account for systematic risks, in particular with regard to the uncertain development of
copper and gold as well as oil prices. It noted, however, that CIMVal generally supports
the use of forward curves, including their extension beyond publicly quoted prices, and
that the Tribunal would therefore not follow Respondent’s general rejection of using
forward curves as a basis for projecting risk-adjusted prices. The question whether the
risk adjustment made by Prof. Davis is sufficient to account for the fluctuation of prices
over the 56-year life of the mine will form part of the present analysis, which will also
take into account the comparison drawn by Respondent’s experts to the “traditional” DCF
calculation in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.

1478. With regard to Respondent’s argument that it was incorrect for Prof. Davis to use a risk-
free rate to discount the cash flows because these cash flows are not, or at least not fully,
adjusted for risk, the Tribunal has already taken note of CIMVal’s explanation in the
context of selecting discount rates for valuing reserves and resources that the certainty-

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 497 of 1447

equivalent DCF approach “does not make use of an aggregate discount rate though an
implied aggregate discount rate can be derived” but instead “uses targeted risk-
adjustments for select cash flow components. These adjustments are done within the
CAPM framework. Market related uncertainties such as metal and energy prices are risk-
adjusted with the CAPM while project-specific uncertainties may be modelled directly
with no risk-adjustment.” 8° At the same time, CIMVal stated:
“A residual risk adjustment may be necessary to adjust previously risk-
adjusted cash flows for risk not explicitly recognized in the model before a
final adjustment for the time value of money. The residual risk adjustment is
similar in nature to a Credit Valuation Adjustment applied in derivative
valuation for counter-party risk.”!8°
1479. As confirmed by CIMVal, the Tribunal therefore agreed with Prof. Davis that it is, in
principle, consistent to use a risk-free rate which discounts cash flows only for the time
value of money, if these cash flows have already been fully adjusted for risk. However,
in line with the explanation provided by CIMVal, the Tribunal will now also assess
whether it may be necessary to apply a residual risk adjustment to account for any risks
that were not explicitly recognized in Prof. Davis’ model. In the Tribunal’s view, this also
applies to risks that were recognized as such but for which the risk adjustments made are,
in the Tribunal’s opinion, insufficient to fully capture the relevant risk; such risks might
warrant additional or increased risk adjustments as well.

1480.In line with the distinction drawn by Prof. Davis between systematic risks, such as in
particular the fluctuation of gold, copper and oil prices but also the risk of cost increases,
and asymmetric risks, such as the risk of political violence and other, mostly country-
related risks, the Tribunal will assess whether Prof. Davis has appropriately accounted
for each type of risk in turn.

a. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Accounted for the Systematic Risk of
Fluctuations in the Prices for Copper, Gold and Oil

1481.Prof. Davis explained in his first report that the approach of the modern DCF method to
addressing systematic risk is as follows:

“The advantage of the modern DCF approach is that reasonable market
signals about the market’s systematic risk preferences over individual cash
flow components is often available in futures or forward markets, whereas
market signals about risk preferences over the systematic risks in the overall,
combined net cash flows of the entire project, which are required to calculate
the appropriate discount rate in the traditional DCF method, are not.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -487-

In the case of Reko Dig, commodity prices are major drivers of both revenues
(copper and gold prices) and costs (oil prices, which drive fuel costs), and
are also major sources of project uncertainties. Futures prices are available
to capture the market risk of each. The modern DCF’s approach of first
adjusting the cash flows for asymmetric risk and then adjusting the results for
market-based, systematic risk via the discounting adjustments inherent in the
futures prices replaces the relatively ad hoc approach to discounting
asymmetric and systematic risks inherent in the traditional DCF approach.
In that approach the discount rate is increased by some amount to try to
account for the value impact of both types of risk.”!®°°

1482.Prof. Davis explained that the modern DCF approach eliminates the need to estimate an
expected future price and a risk-adjusted discount rate because “[t]he impact of risk is
already captured by using futures prices which reflect a discount from the expected spot
price in the future in exchange for a guaranteed price set today. All that remains to be
done is discount the risk-adjusted copper revenues at the risk-free rate to account for the
price of time.”'**’ He further explained in detail his approach to forecasting and
simulating commodity prices in Appendix C to his first report.!*°*

1483.Respondent’s experts Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells distinguished in their first report
between four steps in Prof. Davis’ approach: (i) determining the volatility of prices based
on historical data up to the valuation date; (ii) obtaining futures prices for each commodity
as of the valuation date for the period covered by the futures quotations; (iii) projecting
prices for a time period of 56 years based on the futures market data; and (iv) applying a
random variable for each price and year and running a total of 1.2 million simulations
covering six scenarios. As for the first step, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells noted that
they would have accounted for standard deviations “with an appropriate parameter” but
added that “it is unlikely that the results would have changed significantly.” They further
stated that they did “not object to the way that stochastic projections are carried out,”
i.e., the fourth step identified above. However, in their opinion, “the second and third
steps [are] completely inappropriate, i.e. the use and characterization of futures prices

and the way the projections paramaters were obtained.” °°

1484. Specifically, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells criticized Prof. Davis for basing his
projections on “data for the futures market alone, with no recourse at all to the historical
data before the valuation date.”'’” In their opinion, Prof. Davis’ approach assumes that
Claimant would sell all of its expected gold and copper production as well as acquire all

required quantities of oil at the valuation date at the prices in the futures or forward
markets. Noting that production quantities would have exceeded open interest for copper
and gold by far, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered it incorrect to call the prices
from futures markets risk-adjusted.'87!

1485.In their opinion, futures prices for both copper and gold further have “extremely poor

predictive power ..., especially at turning points,” which they illustrated with the

following graph:!*7

Futures prices have failed systematically to predict actual prices

1486. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further noted that for gold, Prof. Davis relied on data from
the forward market, and argued that the forward market price for gold is “simply the spot
price of the day plus an interest charge,” reflecting an underlying financial transaction
rather than a price prediction. '*”*

Instead of relying on futures and forward markets, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells

considered that Prof. Davis should have averaged the results of a group of forecasts such

as Consensus Economic forecasts, “which include the contributions of around twenty
financial and commercial research institutions and academics.”'*™ They added:

“(W]e are under no illusion that any long-term, or indeed short-term, forecast
of commodity prices can be accurate. This is a major stumbling block in any
DCF analysis, one that is more of an impediment to conducting a serious
DCF analysis in this case because capital costs are also a variable quantity.
Probabilistic approaches to the problem are therefore a good instrument to
measure the size of the uncertainty. However, these must be constructed in a

reasonable way. As mentioned, the Brattle Report ignores completely the
history of prices to construct the deterministic part of the analysis of prices.
For this purpose, it relies exclusively on the futures markets, which, as we
have shown, are extremely thin and shallow after a few years ahead, as well
as being driven by interest rates. We would agree with the Brattle Report that
copper and oil tend to follow a mean-reverting behavior and that gold varies
as a random walk process with a drift. The fatal flaw in Brattle’s method —
and as we shall see later, this flaw accounts for 4/5 of the claim — lies in the
starting point of the projection and in the drift parameter that the Brattle
Report uses.”'87>

1489. In response to Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ criticisms, Prof. Davis reiterated in his
second report that “[o]ne of the core advantages of the modern DCF method is that it
eschews the need to forecast spot commodity prices and relies instead on risk-adjusted
prices, which reflect both market expectations of future prices and the market’s pricing
of the associated systematic risk. These risk-adjusted prices are directly observable in the
futures market for shorter maturities and can be estimated using accepted models for
longer maturities.” He emphasized that “[e]ither way, these risk-adjusted prices are not
forecasts of the spot price’ and therefore considered it an “apples-to-oranges
comparison” to compare his assumptions regarding risk-adjusted prices with analyst

forecasts of the non-risk-adjusted spot price. 7°

1490. Prof. Davis further denied that consensus forecasts were superior to forward prices when
it comes to commodity prices, considering that such a conclusion was not supported by
any of the literature relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, which was in any event

mostly based on a discussion taken from the Consensus Economics website.'*”?

1491.In support of his argument that forward prices can reliably project risk-adjusted prices
over the life of the asset, Prof. Davis distinguished between three time horizons: (i) the
first five years for which futures contracts are actually traded and for which the forward
prices on which he relied are “virtually identical’; (ii) the following five years for which

forward prices had been published as of the valuation date and, given the agreement of
Respondent’s experts that there is “ample liquidity” for the gold market, there was no
reason to suspect that these forward prices were not representative of the market

1492. Prof. Davis specifically agreed with Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that forward prices
are not a forecast of future prices but rather reflect the characteristics of an underlying
financial transaction. He then explained why, in his opinion, this does not render them
inappropriate for valuation purposes:

“Futures purchases and sales are financial transactions, and the pricing of
those transactions has a specific relationship to spot prices as shown in the
above equation. That does not make them inadequate indicators of future risk-
adjusted prices — on the contrary, they reflect the view of market participants
who have substantial amounts of money at stake and every incentive to make
accurate predictions. Of course, they are not predictions of spot prices, and
Ido not use them as such.”'**!

1493. For the extension of the forward curves beyond ten years and, thus, the long-term horizon,
Prof. Davis noted that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells had not criticized the mean-
reverting model he had used for copper prices; for the model used to predict gold prices,
he had assumed that the rate of drift in the forward curve would remain equal to the drift
derived within the 10-year forward price. In his opinion, this was a conservative
assumption given that bond yields increase in maturity.'**? He then expressed the
following opinion:

“Ultimately, the magnitude of the gap between my long-run projections and
those developed by Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells stems almost entirely
from their incorrect view that the appropriate data to use in a modern DCF
analysis is the un-risked expected spot prices as reflected in the average of
analyst forecasts. The differences are that 1) their ten-year price forecast is
incorrectly based on analyst forecasts, whereas mine is based on forward
prices, as required by the valuation model; 2) their long-run projection
assumes that the price would continue to fall, extrapolating the ten-year price
curve developed from analyst forecasts, which is not a projection of risk-
adjusted prices, while mine is correctly based on the forward curve; and 3)
even though both I and they agree that gold prices follow a geometric
Brownian motion with drift, their projection of spot gold prices in the long
run is inconsistent with a geometric Brownian motion with drift, while my

projection of forward prices in the long run is exactly a Geometric Brownian
motion.”

1494. Prof. Davis emphasized that “there is no choice as to whether to use the forward prices
or a forecast of spot prices in a modern DCF” because “analysts do not forecast the
forward curve. What analysts claim to forecast is the spot price, which is not needed in
the modern DCF method.” In his opinion, the forecasts relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and
Prof. Wells also cannot be treated as estimates of expected spot prices because they imply
an expected loss of about 3% per year (35% over the next ten years), which runs contrary
to investors’ expectations that they will receive positive returns from investing in gold,
due to an expected price appreciation. Prof. Davis illustrated the expected negative return
based on the Consensus Economics forecast as follows:!8*4

1495. Prof. Davis noted that “[i]f the Consensus Economics forecasts reflected investors’ views
of the expected spot price of gold, then no one would be willing to buy gold at the spot
prices prevailing in October 2011, when the analyst forecasts were published, and those
who were holding gold at the time would sell, anticipating the price fall. But if that were
the case, the spot price would have fallen as well because supply of gold would exceed
demand. In other words, interpreting the Consensus Economics forecast as a measure of
expected spot prices is inconsistent with the observed spot price of gold.” Prof. Davis
further considered that, based on historical data, analyst forecasts “are consistently biased
downward and increasingly inaccurate as the forecast horizon grows,” noting that long-
term forecasts are up to 50% below the realized spot price and adding that if such bias
were removed, “there is little discrepancy left between the consensus forecast and the

forward curve.”'885

1496.In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells noted that Claimant’s damages
claim is very sensitive to price forecasts, in particular to that of the gold price, and
calculated that the damage would disappear when using the “reasonable price
projections” of Consensus Economics. Specifically, they calculated that when using those
forecasts for gold, the average net present value of Claimant’s investment, all else being
equal, would drop to USD 0.89 billion, i.e., by almost 90%; when also using the forecasts
for copper, it would drop to USD -0.72 billion; and when also using the forecasts for oil,
it would drop to USD -1.23 billion.'*°°

1497.Respondent’s experts reiterated that they “explicitly reject [Prof. Davis’] central
assumptions that futures prices should be used as forecasts in DCF analyses” and
clarified that they also opposed Prof. Davis’ projection of the copper price based on
futures prices. In response to Prof. Davis’ methodological argument that the modern DCF
method requires the use of risk-adjusted prices rather than forecasts of spot prices, Mr.
Brailovsky and Prof. Wells considered it “paradoxical” that Prof. Davis’ allegedly risk-
adjusted prices produce considerably more revenues than those forecast by the consensus

experts even though the latter “presumably contain all sorts of risks.”'887

1498.Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells then stated that “prices of minerals —in particular the
all-important gold price— are ‘mean reverting.’ This is in marked contrast to the
assumption in the Brattle reports that they are ever climbing.” Specifically with regard
to gold, they relied on an econometric method called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and
claimed that this method, while resulting in “somewhat higher” price projections than
Consensus Economics forecast, confirmed that the price of gold was also mean-reverting
and not a “random walk with time-dependent drift.”'8°

1499.In the opinion of Respondent’s experts, the futures prices relied on by Prof. Davis “are
neither market determined nor the best source available for price forecasts.” They noted
that the project would have begun to sell its production only seven years after the
valuation date, making the period for which futures prices exist, and also a large part of
the period for which forward curves exist, irrelevant for the valuation of the project’s cash
flows. In their opinion, the fact that futures prices are higher than those forecast by
Consensus Economics indicates that the former are in fact riskier than the latter, which
contradicts Prof. Davis’ statement that his price assumptions are risk-adjusted.'**° With
regard to Prof. Davis’ criticisms of the consensus forecasts, they argued:

“We are under no illusion that commodities prices can be accurately
predicted, as we have said; the future is unknown and unknowable. Neither
the futures prices nor consensus forecasts have a really good predictive
record. That is why Brattle’s effort to show how poorly the mean Consensus
Economics forecasts have predicted actual prices, without comparison to
other methods, is not useful. But the available empirical studies clearly favour
the Consensus Economics forecasts.” !*°°

1500.Relying on statements made by economists regarding a lack of accuracy of predictions
made by futures prices, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells rejected the argument that
forward market prices are the market’s actual risk-adjusted expectations of what futures
prices will be. In particular quoting from economists at the Federal Reserve Board of San
Francisco, who stated with regard to oil futures prices that “taking into account the
relationship between current spot prices and futures prices instead of considering only
the raw futures price can significantly improve forecasting accuracy,” Respondent’s
experts also denied that, by considering forecasts for spot prices, they were making an
“apples-to-oranges comparison.”'**' They also rejected Prof. Davis’ suggestion that it is
not necessary to know the non-risk-adjusted price, arguing that “[t]o be able to say that
futures prices are risk-adjusted, one has to know the amount of such risk adjustment. That
information is not provided in the Brattle reports. Just saying that futures prices are risk-

adjusted is not enough.”

1501.Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further rejected the argument that Consensus Economics
forecasts cannot be used to predict spot prices, arguing that “at any point in time,
economic agents have divergent expectations,” that “the markets do not adjust
instantaneously to expectations,” and further that “the decline in gold prices in the
forecasts is consistent with the comparatively small response of share prices of gold
producers shown in the Burrow’s reports.”'®°> They also denied that analyst forecasts are
biased downwards, arguing that just like the futures market, forecasts of commodity
prices tend to underestimate prices when they are rising, as they were in the time period
from 1998 to 2011 examined by Prof. Davis, but to overestimate them when they are

falling, as they did after the valuation date.'***

1502. The Tribunal notes that, as becomes apparent through Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’
calculation of the impact on the value of Claimant’s investment if the price projections
made by Prof. Davis were to be replaced by the Consensus Economics forecasts, the
question which assumptions a buyer would have made as of November 2011 with regard
to gold, copper and oil prices has a very significant impact on the purchase price it would

have been willing to pay for the Reko Dig project. In particular, and despite the fact that
Reko Diq was intended to produce far larger quantities of copper than of gold, the
deviating gold price predictions based on the Consensus Economics forecast would have
had the largest impact, reducing the value of Claimant’s investment from USD 8.5 billion
to USD 0.89 billion, all else being equal. That the deviation between the sources relied
on by the Parties’ experts is by far larger larger for gold than for copper was illustrated
by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells by the following graphs:'*?>

1503.Claimant did not dispute the accuracy of Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ calculation
and thus the impact it would have on the value of its investment if a buyer were to base
its price projections on the Consensus Economics forecast instead of futures and forward
market data. The significance of the projections for gold, copper and oil prices appears to
be undisputed and was confirmed by Mr. Livesey already at the Hearing on Jurisdiction
and Liability when he testified that “[t]he fuel price and the metals price primarily are
the things that are driving the returns on this project.”'*°°

1504. Bearing this significance in mind, the Tribunal has carefully considered the opinions
provided by the experts from both sides and maintains its initial conclusion that Prof.
Davis’ approach to use futures and/or forward market prices for the purposes of projecting
risk-adjusted prices for his valuation model is generally plausible and supported by the
2012 CIMVal report of valuation practices in the mining industry. However, the Tribunal
has also taken note of the arguments raised by Respondent’s experts, in particular the fact
that the prices for gold that Prof. Davis derived from the futures and forward markets are
considerably higher than the prices derived from analyst forecasts.

1505.As a preliminary point, the Tribunal is not convinced by the argument made by Mr.
Brailovsky and Prof. Wells in their first report that using futures and forward prices would

require making the assumption that the entire production quantities would be sold, and
the entire quantities of required oil would be acquired, as of the valuation date, thereby
exceeding by far the available demand for copper and gold. The Tribunal does not
understand the assumption to be that Claimant would have entered into actual transactions
at the prices assumed by Prof. Davis but rather that, as he explained in his second report,
the futures and forward prices as of the valuation date reflect the market expectations of
future prices at the time as well as the market’s pricing of the systematic risk associated
with these expectations.'**” In his opinion, these prices therefore directly lead to the input
required for the modern DCF method, i.e., the price whose application results in a cash
flow which has already been adjusted for the systematic risk associated with price
fluctuations, and thereby also does away with the need to predict a spot price as well as a
separate risk adjustment.

1506. The Tribunal considers it undisputed that the Consensus Economics forecasts relied on
by Respondent’s experts attempt to predict spot prices rather than the risk-adjusted prices
Prof. Davis is seeking as an input for his modern DCF model. In the Tribunal’s view, it
is therefore apparent that the two sets of price predictions used by the Parties’ experts
cannot be directly compared. At the same time, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky
and Prof. Wells that a buyer might have been concerned with the fact that the prices for
gold from the futures and forward markets, which incorporate the market’s pricing of the
risk associated with price predictions over a certain time period, were considerably higher
than the analysts’ forecasts of prices which do not incorporate such risks. These concerns
would then have been intensified by the different trends predicted by the forward curve
and the consensus forecast, respectively, over a 10-year period, which are then
extrapolated over the remainder of the predicted mine life, assuming that the initially
predicted trend will continue over the entire production period. As illustrated by
Respondent’s experts, this leads to a continuously widening gap between the risk-adjusted
prices projected by Prof. Davis (solid red line) and the non-risk-adjusted prices projected

by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells (green line):!8°8

1507. Prof. Davis addressed this discrepancy and the criticisms raised by Respondent’s experts
regarding the use of futures and forward prices and provided various arguments
supporting his reliance on these prices both for short-term and long-term predictions.
Prof. Davis also presented arguments as to why the forecasts relied on by Respondent’s
experts should not be used as a basis for making projections, noting in particular that they
do not even attempt to predict risk-adjusted prices and are, in his opinion, inconsistent
with accepted models of how the commodity markets and specifically the gold price are
expected to develop over the long term.

1508. The Tribunal considers that Prof. Davis’ methodological argument, i.e., that it would be
inaccurate to refer to analyst forecasts to determine risk-adjusted prices sought as input
for the modern DCF model and that forward market prices are the best and in fact only
indication of how the market prices that risk, is generally plausible. However, taking into
account the large gap between particularly the gold price predictions, the Tribunal
considers that the plausibility of the price assumptions made by Prof. Davis cannot be
assessed without also addressing the question whether there is a plausible reason for the
gap to the forecasts of spot prices made by analysts at the same time.

1509. In this regard, the Tribunal also notes that the suggestion implied in Claimant’s and Prof.
Davis’ argument that forecasts of spot prices are irrelevant to determining the risk-
adjusted prices sought for the modern DCF model is not confirmed by the academic
literature in the record and also does not correspond to the 2012 CIMVal report. In the
Tribunal’s view, an article dated 30 December 2005 authored by an economist from the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, assessing whether oil futures prices help predict
future oil prices, is particularly instructive. The author first confirmed that “[o] il futures

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 509 of 1447
Award
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -498-

prices reflect the price that both the buyer and the seller agree will be the price of oil
upon delivery. Therefore, these prices provide direct information about investor’s
expectations about the future price of oil.” He added, however, that oil futures prices
include risk premiums to reflect the possibility of higher or lower prices and that those
risk premiums are “quite large and volatile over time,” which suggested that “‘oil futures
prices are not necessarily the best predictor of future oil prices.”'*°? The author then
stated that “[t]he current, or spot, oil prive may also help predict future oil price
movements” and, based on an assessment of four models based on oil futures prices and
the spot oil price, reached the following conclusion:

“Raw futures prices are found to be unbiased predictors of future oil prices;
that is, for the past two decades, the raw oil futures prices are as likely to
overpredict as to underpredict future oil prices. However, while the average
of forecasting errors based on raw futures prices may be close to zero, such
errors are quite large over time. Indeed, raw oil futures prices provide
relatively less accurate forecasts than models using both the futures prices
and spot price (the ‘futures-spot spread’ model). Therefore, incorporating
information on the relationship between current futures prices and spot price
improves the forecast.”'°

1510.The author also noted that futures prices were more accurate in predicting near-term oil
price movements than longer-term movements and provided the following explanation:

“The observation that futures prices are more useful in forecasting near-term
oil price movements may reflect the fact that the near-term oil futures markets
are much more liquid than longer-term futures markets. For instance, the
average daily trading volume of the ‘light, sweet crude oil’ futures contracts
on the New York Mercantile Exchange over the past two years is about 72,600
contracts for a horizon of one month, 22,000 units for two months, 4,800 for
four months, and only 1,000 units for the one-year horizon (one unit repre-
sents 1,000 barrels). As the futures market becomes less liquid at longer
horizons, the quoted futures prices may become a less accurate measure of
expected oil prices, because they are more vulnerable to shocks that may not
be related to the expected oil price movements in the future.”!?!

1511.He then concluded with the section quoted by Respondent’s experts in their second report:

“Oil futures prices contain important information about future oil price
movements, especially for the near term. In particular, taking into account
the relationship between current spot and futures prices instead of
considering only the raw futures price can significantly improve forecasting
accuracy. Prediction errors, however, are still substantial, and accurately
predicting the future price of oil seems as elusive as ever.”'9°”

1512. While the Tribunal is aware that this paper was limited to discussing the usefulness of
futures prices to predicting future oil prices and did not extend its conclusions to
predictions of gold or copper prices, the Tribunal does consider it instructive that, at least
for oil, there are indications that futures prices may not be, in isolation, the best indicator
of future prices but that forecasts of spot prices and different models describing the
relationship between futures and spot prices may also be considered useful to obtain a
more accurate prediction of future prices. The Tribunal appreciates the fact that Prof.
Davis did not attempt to predict actual future prices but rather prices which have already
been adjusted for the risk associated with price uncertainty. However, the Tribunal cannot
accept that forecasts of the spot price would therefore be considered irrelevant. More
specifically, the Tribunal is not convinced that a buyer would base its price assumptions
exclusively on forward markets and not take into account at all forecasts of spot prices,
in particular when taking into account the undisputed volatility of prices and difficulty in
predicting them, the large impact of this volatility on the value of the project as well as
the long life of the mine over which the predictions made by the forward markets have to
be extrapolated, thus creating considerable additional uncertainty.

1513.In the Tribunal’s view, the reasonableness of taking into account more than one source
for a price assumption is also confirmed by CIMVal, which reports in response to the
question how future prices are estimated that they “generally use a combination of
sources to estimate forecast future metal prices, including management forecasts, spot
prices, consensus forecasts from investment banks and forecasts derived from forward

curves as the circumstances dictate.” CIMVal then explains in detail as to why it
considers that “in appropriate circumstances a commodity price forecast may be derived
from its forward price curve” and that “[ml]etal price forecasts based on the forward curve
may be extended beyond the publicly quoted prices based on the characteristics of the
metal ... and the market characteristics of the forward curve.” CIMVal explicitly
confirms that “[t]he forward price is considered a risk—adjusted expected price since a
party choosing to buy or sell a commodity in the future would first need to estimate what
the spot price might be and then adjust this estimated price for variance around the

forecast (i.e., applying a risk adjustment).”!9°

1514.In the Tribunal’s view, this is a strong indication for the soundness of Prof. Davis’
approach to rely on market data from the forward markets and to extrapolate the forward
market curve to obtain data for the period of 10+x years after the valuation date. However,
the Tribunal cannot deduce from CIMVal’s explanation that it would be inaccurate to
cross-check the results obtained with this approach by looking, inter alia, at spot prices
and consensus forecasts. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal considers it likely

that a buyer would also take into account more than one source for the prediction of future
prices and at least consider whether there is a plausible explanation for the discrepancy
between the prices forecast by analysts and the prices quoted in the futures and forward
markets.

1515.In this regard, Claimant and Prof. Davis argued that the Consensus Economics forecast
relied on by Respondent’s experts is unreliable and has historically been biased
downwards. Specifically, Prof. Davis noted that analysts have continuously under-
predicted gold prices, on average, since they started to publish long-term forecasts in 1998
and further argued that the forecasts are contrary to investors’ expectations that an
investment in gold yields a positive return. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, on the other
hand, noted that the under-prediction occurred only in times of increasing prices and that,
by contrast, analysts over-predicted prices when they started to fall. While Claimant
argues that this shows the general unreliability of the forecast, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof.
Wells pointed out that a similar correlation of under-prediction of rising prices and over-
prediction of falling prices also occurs in the futures market for gold and copper prices.
That this is in fact the case is confirmed by Prof. Davis’ illustration of the gold forward

curves between January 2008 and September 2011:!°%

1516.In these circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced that an average under-prediction of
prices while they were rising would suffice to demonstrate a general “downward bias” of
consensus forecasts or to fully explain the discrepancy between the consensus forecasts
and the forward curve. In fact, recalling the statement made by Respondent’s experts that
“[njeither the futures prices nor consensus forecasts have a really good predictive
record,” !° the Tribunal considers its conclusion reinforced that while it is reasonable to
rely on data from the forward markets, a buyer would likely also cross-check the
plausibility of the assumptions made on the basis of such forward market data by looking
at other indicators of future prices, such as those listed by CIMVal, which specifically
include spot prices and consensus forecasts.

1517.In the opinion of Prof. Davis, the unreliability of the Economic Consensus forecast for
the gold price is further demonstrated by the fact that it contradicts expectations of
investors to receive a positive return when investing in gold as well as the actual
development of the spot price as of the valuation date. The Tribunal notes that there is
agreement between the Parties’ experts to the extent that gold can be characterized as an
investment asset but that they disagree as to the expected long-term development of the
gold price. While Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells initially agreed with Prof. Davis “that
copper and oil tend to follow a mean-reverting behavior, and that gold varies as a random

walk process with a drift,”!°°°

they claimed to have found in their second report that “the
price of gold is also mean reverting, as are prices of copper and oil. It is not the ‘random
walk with time-dependent drift’ that Brattle assumes to obtain its ever-rising pattern for
gold.”'°" As Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells introduced this finding and the method on
which it was based only in their second report, Prof. Davis did not have the opportunity
to respond to it in writing. At the Hearing on Quantum, he testified that “[t]he test
[suggested by Prof. Wells and Mr. Brailovsky] was not conducted using appropriate
statistical procedure” and that their calculation reflected “an error in a key statistic.”'°°*
In support of his opinion, he referred to an appendix of his presentation.!°° Claimant
further introduced an additional excerpt from the textbook on which Mr. Brailovsky and
Prof. Wells had relied in carrying out their test, which confirmed in its view that the test
could not be used for the purposes of verifying whether or not the gold price is mean-
reverting.'?!° According to Claimant, additional data produced by Respondent revealed
that Respondent’s experts also performed the correct test which yielded the opposite
conclusion, i.e., that it cannot be rejected statistically that the gold price is not mean-

reverting.'?!! All of these exhibits were admitted de bene esse and are now admitted into
the record.

1518.In the Tribunal’s view, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding as to the accuracy
or reliability of either of the statistical tests applied by the Parties’ experts to assess
whether or not the gold price follows a mean-reverting pattern like copper or oil. In any
event, the Tribunal is not convinced that a consensus forecast predicting considerably
lower prices and, perhaps even more importantly, a different price trend than the forward
market would not have been taken into account at all by a buyer valuing the project as of
the valuation date. More specifically, the Tribunal does not consider it established that a
buyer would have based its price assumption exclusively on the forward market curve,
extrapolating it to predict a constant increase of the gold price for 56 years into the future,
without accounting for the possibility that gold prices might develop differently, despite
the considerable deviation between the predictions derived from forward markets and
from the Consensus Economics forecasts, respectively.

1519. As noted above, the Tribunal is convinced that Prof. Davis’ approach to use the forward
market curve as a basis to determine risk-adjusted prices is methodologically sound and
therefore considers it likely that a buyer would also have used this approach as a basis for
its price predictions. The Tribunal is not convinced, however, that this approach fully
captures the risk associated with the fluctuation of prices over a time period of 56 years.
In the Tribunal’s view, this applies not only to the gold price for which the discrepancy
between the forward curve and consensus forecasts is particularly large, but also to the
prices for copper and oil. Claimant itself noted that “[t]he range of variability in
projecting [price fluctuations] years into the future is massive.”'?'* While Claimant
argues that the discount made by Prof. Davis for systematic risk is “likely to be
significant” and claims that “[t]here is no reason to assume ... that the corresponding

1913 the Tribunal notes that Claimant bears the burden of

discount is a small number,
proving that Prof. Davis fully captured the impact of systematic risk on the value of its

investment.

1520. The Tribunal is aware that Prof. Davis has applied a probabilistic approach, which means
that, only on average, he assumed that prices would have developed along the forward
curve and its extrapolation, while in a certain number of his simulations, prices would
also have turned out to be significantly lower (or, in the case of oil, higher) than this
average. In the Tribunal’s view, this shows that he did recognize a certain risk of prices
developing differently and it would therefore not be appropriate to make a finding that
the price prediction made by a buyer would have been, e.g., in the middle between the

forward curve and the analyst forecasts. The Tribunal also notes that it has not been
provided with sensitivity analyses using different price predictions; however, it has been
provided with the average value based on forward curve price predictions (USD 8.5
billion) and the average value based on Consensus Economics forecasts (USD -1.23
billion when using them for gold, copper and oil).

1521.The Tribunal will therefore proceed to make what it considers to be the most reasonable
assumption in the circumstances of the case. Based on the considerations set out above
and the difference of almost USD 10 billion between the calculations made by the Parties’
experts, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that a buyer would have factored
in the possibility that not all of the systematic risk associated with the development of
prices over the 56-year life of the mine is fully captured in the available market data and
quotations going up to ten years into the future and the extrapolation of such data over
the remainder of the mine’s life. It is undisputed that there is no market pricing of the
systematic risk extending over a 56-year mine life and Prof. Davis specifically agreed at
the Hearing on Quantum that the cash flows acquired by the buyer would remain “highly
uncertain and highly risky.”!°'+ The Tribunal therefore concludes that it is likely that a
buyer would have assigned a price to assuming this long-term risk by reducing its
expectation of the cash flows that the Reko Diq project would generate over the life of
the mine by 25%. This results in a reduction of the value of Claimant’s investment by
USD 2,430 million.

b. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Accounted for the Risk of Increases
in Capital and Operating Expenditures (Other than Oil)

1522.In addition to the risk associated with the projection of prices for gold, copper and oil,
there is common ground that the project also faced uncertainty regarding the expected
costs or, more precisely, costs other than oil which has already been addressed above. In
this regard, Prof. Davis explained that he had referred to futures markets where available,
such as for oil, but could not do so where there is no futures markets pricing the expected
costs. He added that “[i]f there are no market signals to determine the at-source risk
adjustments for the risks of some cost elements and the traditional projections are used
instead (as would be available from engineering studies for example), then the net present
value of costs will be overstated and project value understated, since costs are a
substraction from revenues and the necessary adjustment for systematic risk, whether

done at-source or through the discount rate, would lower their value.” !9'5

1523. With regard to capital costs, Prof. Davis explained that he had made certain adjustments
to the cost estimates contained in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility

Study, accounting for inflation until the valuation date, cost escalation based on forecasts
for capital cost escalation rates as well as general inflation based on inflation swaps
reflecting market expectation of inflation and its correlation to the overall market. Prof.
Davis stated that these adjustments increased the cumulative capital costs in the
Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study by 136% and 99%,
respectively. !°!° He explained that, in addition to the adjustments for systematic risk, cost
projections also had to be adjusted to reflect the impact of asymmetric risk, which he had
done separately. Finally, Prof. Davis noted that he had refrained from making adjustments
for the systematic risk of variation around the mean correlated with overall market
movements because he considered this risk difficult to quantify in a reliable manner and
“excluding the adjustment possibly overstates the present value of costs and understates

project value.”'9!7

1524. As for operating costs, Prof. Davis stated that he had used the project operating cost
schedules which had been updated by Barrick in 2011 based on updated fuel prices and
other cost information obtained through its global supply chain organization. Noting that
fuel made up 38% of operating costs in the Initial Mine Development scenario and 40%
in the Expansion Scenario and that these costs were “highly correlated with crude oil
prices,” Prof. Davis estimated fuel operating costs based on oil market price signals.!°!*

As for non-fuel operating costs, he modeled increases in real operating costs based on

escalation rates forecasts, amounting to 11% over the four years following the valuation

date. He then converted these costs into nominal terms by using the forecast of CPI
inflation which als reflects systematic risk in price inflation. According to Prof. Davis,
this resulted in a cumulative increase of the non-fuel operating costs included in the

Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study by 225% and 141%,

respectively.!°!° Prof. Davis further referred to additional adjustments made to account

for asymmetric risks identified in Claimant’s risk register.!°?°

1525.In their first report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells criticized Prof. Davis for failing to
account for potential cost overruns in his model. In their opinion, the adjustments he had
made to the capital cost estimates of the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study “result from normal inflation rates accumulated over a period of 65
years, not from any consideration of cost overruns.” They noted that Prof. Davis had
made “some adjustment’ for “residual risk” concerning capital expenditures which
represented 1.7% of the value of the investment program and, in their opinion, “does not

seem at all commensurate with the experience of cost overruns.” For operating costs,
Respondent’s experts considered that “a similarly minor adjustment for risk is included,
equivalent to 2.4% of [operating] costs.”!°?! Specifically, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells
referred to studies comparing capital cost estimates in feasibility studies and capital costs
actually incurred, resulting in an average cost overrun of 22%; they further quoted from
the former Director of Project Evaluations at Barrick, who suggested in an article that “up
to 50%” should be added to costs and schedule when looking at feasibility studies

prepared for a remote area in a third-world country. '!°*

They also noted that, by contrast
to the price of oil, Prof. Davis had not modeled variability for other costs or production
quantities; in their opinion, the software Prof. Davis had used would have enabled him
“to make a reasonable assumption of the type of probability distribution that best fits
capital expenditures in the mining industry, as well as its dispersion.” They concluded

that accounting for capital cost overruns “would greatly reduce the value of the claim.”!°?

1526.Prof. Davis responded to these criticisms in his second report by pointing out that the
adjustments he had made accounted for cost overruns that can result from general
inflation associated with delays, “real” cost increases and growth in the quantity
estimates, “resulting in total escalation well above the benchmarks that Mr. Brailovsky
and Professor Wells cite.” Specifically, Prof. Davis explained that the expected initial
mine development costs in his model were 58% higher than the estimate in the Feasibility
Study. He rejected the argument that his adjustment accounted only for inflation and
noted that it was difficult to understand “how inflation over 65 years is at all relevant,
when most capital expenditures are incurred upfront, when the mine is built.” He also
emphasized that the effects of inflation have to be included when cost overruns are

reported and therefore also form part of his adjustments.!°?4

1527.Prof. Davis explained that he had made the following adjustments to the Feasibility
Study’s capital cost estimate: (i) increase by 18% to account for inflation up to the
valuation date; (ii) increase by 21.4% to account for “real” cost escalation (in excess of
inflation) over the five-year period following the valuation date; (iii) increase by expected
rate of CPI inflation over the same period; and (iv) further increases to account for
asymmetric risks identified by Claimant in its residual risk register that would result in

cost overruns, the effects of which are “typically small for large projects.”!°?>

1528. Prof. Davis emphasized that his adjustments went beyond the contingency included in the
Feasibility Study and built in “a substantial increase in both capital and operating costs

in an environment with rising commodity prices.” Specifically, he noted that by updating
the cost estimates from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study made as of October 2009, he
increased Opex estimates by 10-11% and Capex estimates by 17-18%.'°7° He stated that

cost escalation forecasts, he had reduced the value of Claimant’s investment by more than

1529.Prof. Davis emphasized that contrary to what Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells appeared
to suggest, “neither capital nor operating cots rise proportionally with commodity
prices,” which he illustrated as follows: 1928

1530. Finally, Prof. Davis noted that he had not modeled capital cost variability around the
projected average values in his first report as he did not expect that it would have a
significant effect on his value estimate but had now performed such a test, incorporating
into the simulation the possibility that capital costs would vary above or below the
projected values. Prof. Davis stated that the effect of this addition was a decrease in
project value by 1.5% to USD 8.4 billion. !°”?

1531.As for operating costs, Prof. Davis explained that he had increased the cost estimate by
11.6% (initial mine development scenario) and 9.8% (expansion scenario) to account for
cost increases up to the valuation date based on Barrick’s updated cost schedule and, in
addition, for real escalation of costs for future periods based on cost escalation forecasts
for the mining industry. According to Prof. Davis, these adjustments also accounted for

inflation in labor costs associated with rising commodities markets. !*°°

1532.In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells argued that the expenditures
modelded by Prof. Davis were “only slightly higher than those of the SNC-Lavalin study,
2.7% in constant terms.” They recognized that “the capital expenditure is much higher,
by US$ 2.96 billion,” maintaining that “most of the increase” was the result of inflation
adjustments, but emphasized that operating costs were “much lower, by US$ 2.4 billion,
largely offsetting each other,” without any explanation from Prof. Davis on this point.!?7!

1533.Respondent’s experts further considered that the effect of variability for capital costs
calculated by Prof. Davis was inconsistent with his own writings in which he reported
that “[c]ost overruns of 100% or more happen in roughly I out of 13 projects” and
referred to an intentional and rational bias, “driven by a scarcity of project financing and
the need by project sponsors to inflate the project economics in a bid to secure
financing.”'°*? Respondent’s experts further considered that in making his test for
variability, Prof. Davis had incorrectly applied a distribution mean of 1 even though his
study indicated that the distribution mean should be 1.25, stating that it had established
“a bias in mining project capital cost estimates that results in as-built capital costs being
25% higher than the estimate in the feasibility study.” Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells
added that using the correct distribution mean, the effect of modeling cost variability
would have been to reduce the value by an additional USD 2 billion, i.e., to USD 6.4
billion.!°3

1534. Respondent’s experts further noted that Prof. Davis had not tested the effects of modeling
variability of operating costs. In their opinion, incorporating variability for both capital
and operating costs (using “half the mean bias” used for capital costs variability, i.e.,
1.125) would reduce the value to USD 5.2 billion.!9**

1535.At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis confirmed that the study he had worked on in
2008 concluded that “the cash spent [on mining projects] tended to be 25 percent more
than what was listed in the Feasibility Study.” He also referred to the other sources relied
on by Respondent’s experts, suggesting an increase of 22% and up to 50%, respectively,

and reiterated that he had already “added 58 percent to Feasibility Study costs to allow
for cost overruns.” Prof. Davis further noted that he had incorporated substantial project
delay risks, estimating an average delay of 5.3 years between the completion of the
Feasibility Study and start of construction, which he also described as “‘de-risking because
that then causes additional costs while you’re waiting and being delayed. It also causes
extra Capital Cost Inflation, and it pushes your revenues more and causes them to be

discounted more for time.”'?>

1536.In the Tribunal’s view, it is undisputed that Prof. Davis made significant adjustments to
the capital cost estimates included in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study. Specifically, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not dispute that Prof.
Davis increased the capital cost estimate by 58% in nominal terms (corresponding to a
33% increase in real terms) and they recognized in their comparison of Prof. Davis’
numbers to the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study that Prof. Davis’ capital cost estimate
was almost USD 3 billion higher than its equivalent in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study. While they maintained their opinion that this increase was largely due to inflation
adjustments, they did not engage with Prof. Davis’ explanation that adjustments for
inflation have to be included in this calculation because the cost overruns reported for
othe mining projects also include the effects of inflation. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells
also did not respond to Prof. Davis’ explanation that the effects of inflation are in any
event limited as most of the capital costs are incurred during the construction period and
thus in the first few years after the feasibility study. In the absence of any further
substantiated argument on this point, the Tribunal cannot follow the opinion of
Respondent’s experts that Prof. Davis’ adjustments to capital costs did not actually
account for the risk of cost overruns experienced by other mining projects.

1537.Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells further argued that Prof. Davis had not adequately
modeled variability of capital costs and thereby significantly understated the effect of
incorporating this aspect of volatility into his model. While Prof. Davis did not
specifically refer to Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ criticism regarding his use of an
allegedly incorrect distribution mean, Claimant pointed out in its Post-Hearing Brief that
the distribution mean of 1.25 indicated in Prof. Davis’ research would have applied to
feasibility study costs. Given that Prof. Davis already made adjustments of 58% in
nominal terms (corresponding to 33% in real terms) to the cost estimates in the Feasibiluty
Study, Claimant argued that “Prof. Davis did not err by conservatively modeling capital
cost volatility with a mean even higher than the 25% average cost overrun reported in

his paper.”'°°6

1538.The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it would appear incorrect to apply the distribution
mean of 1.25, which reflects the assumption that costs will be 25% higher than estimated
in the feasibility study, to a cost estimate which has already been adjusted (by more than
25%) to account for likely cost increases vis-d-vis the feasibility study estimate. Prof.
Davis has shown that the adjustments he has made exceed the cost increases suggested
by the sources relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, including the highest increase

of “up to 50%” suggested for projects in remote, third-world countries.!°*7

1539.In the absence of any substantiated argument as to why the cost adjustments made by
Prof. Davis would not reflect the cost increases reported or suggested by the sources relied
on by Respondent’s experts and in particular the 25% increase established in Prof. Davis’
research from 2008, the Tribunal sees no basis to conclude that Prof. Davis should have
applied a distribution mean of >1 when modeling the variability of capital costs around
his increased cost estimate. However, as Prof. Davis’ own analysis has yielded an impact
on the value of the project, reducing the value of Claimant’s investment by 1.5% or USD
130 million,!°** the Tribunal considers that this amount has to be deducted from the
amount of compensation to which Claimant is entitled.

1540. As for operating costs, Prof. Wells maintained at the Hearing on Quantum that variance
in operating costs was a significant factor for a non-operational project: “Jf you have an
ongoing project, the variance is usually prices. That's where the great uncertainty lies. If
you do not have an ongoing project there are large uncertainties in other elements of the
cash flow and those, in effect, compound. Once looking in the cash flow at the difference
between uncertain revenues, prices, and uncertain costs--well, capital investments and
Operating Costs--then the variance becomes particularly large.”!°*? Mr. Brailovsky
confirmed that oil prices, which Prof. Davis had simulated in his valuation model based
on futures and forward market data, accounted for about 40% of the operating
expenses. !*4? He also confirmed that Prof. Davis’ assumption of operating expenses was
different from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study but again questioned why Prof. Davis’
estimate was in fact lower (USD 23.6 billion as opposed to USD 26 billion) even though
he, Mr. Brailovsky, would have expected the risk-adjusted price for oil to be higher than

the non-adjusted price.'"!

1541.Prof. Davis was not cross-examined on the question why his estimate of operating costs
was lower than the estimate included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study or why he
decided to not also model variability of operating costs. However, Claimant’s position is

indicated in its questions to Mr. Brailovsky regarding the comparison drawn by
Respondent's experts between Prof. Davis’ model and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study, in particular the question whether he understood that “the reason Professor Davis's
aggregate number for Operating Expenses is lower than the one in the Expansion
Feasibility Study is largely driven, not by a failure to account for risk, but by simulating
and using risk-adjusted prices in the forecast for oil.”!°*? The Tribunal has already
addressed the disagreement between the Parties and their experts regarding the
determination of risk-adjusted prices based on futures and forward market data above and
it has found that while Prof. Davis’ approach was generally reasonable, a buyer would
likely have cross-checked the plausibility of its price assumptions and made a deduction
from the purchase price it would be willing to pay to account for the long-term risk of
price uncertainty associated with the 56-year life of the mine and the corresponding need
to extrapolate forward market data over a significant period of time. This deduction also
covered the reduction in value that resulted from basing price predictions for crude oil (as
an indicator for the price of different types of fuel that Claimant contemplated to use for
the project) on consensus forecasts, which projected higher prices than Prof. Davis
derived from the forward market.

1542. As for the non-fuel operating costs, Prof. Davis explained in his reports that he increased
the cost estimate of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study for inflation up to the valuation
date, real escalation as forecasted for the mining industry, and future inflation after the
valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not raise any substantiated criticisms
with regard to either of these adjustments but only referred to the overall estimate for
operating expenses which showed in their opinion that no significant risk adjustments
were made. Consequently, the Tribunal has no basis to conclude that Prof. Davis’
adjustments to non-fuel operating costs were inadequate. It also sees no basis to question
that the overall lower figure in Prof. Davis’ estimate of operating expenses is indeed due
to his adjustments regarding fuel operating costs, which undisputedly made up close to
40% of the total operating expenses.

1543. With regard to the variability of operating costs and the impact that such a calculation
would have had on the value of Claimant’s investment, the Tribunal notes that
Respondent’s experts again assumed in their calculation that the distribution mean would
be >1, .e., in this case 1.125. They did not provide any basis for this assumption, except
that it was “half the mean bias ... used for capital cost variability.”'°*? The Tribunal also
considers that similarly to the calculation for capital costs, it appears incorrect to apply
the distribution mean to Prof. Davis’ cost estimate which has already been adjusted to
account for the same cost increases that are also reflected in the distribution mean.

Consequently, the Tribunal cannot accept the calculation made by Respondent’s experts
with regard to the impact of modeling variability for operating costs.

1544.In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that with the exception of the reduction for variability
of capital costs calculated by Prof. Davis in the amount of USD 130 million, no further
reduction is warranted to account for potential increases in capital costs or operating costs
of the project.

c. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Accounted for the Asymmetric Risks
Affecting the Project, in Particular for Country-related Risks

1545.There is common ground between the Parties and their experts that the project also faced
asymmetric risks, which Prof. Davis described as “negative events that are specific to the
asset rather than affecting the market at large.”'°** Prof. Davis explained that most of the
risks identified in Claimant’s residual risk register qualified as asymmetric risks and
described the approach to account for them risks as follows:
“The first step to risk adjustment is to adjust the affected cash flow
components for these potential negative events such that the correct
probability-weighted cash flow is used in the analysis. For example, if there
is a risk that unforeseen accidents will lead to increased costs, this must be
accounted for by increasing the expected operating costs or decreasing the
expected operating revenues.”'°

 

 

1546.Prof. Davis stated that “[t]he potential negative events considered [in the risk register]
include many country-specific risks during both the construction and operation phases of
the project” and referred to “corruption, armed conflict, delays due to inexperienced
workforces and government authorities, logistics disruptions, community relations
impacts, and changing regulations.” He also noted that “[t]he analysis also contemplated
the possibility of nationalization, which I exclude from my damages calculation by
instruction.”'* Prof. Davis explained that Claimant had monetized the financial impact
for those events that, if realized in their mitigated state, would have direct financial
consequences for the operations, into either a capital cost or operating cost. In order to
effect asymmetric risk adjustment, Prof. Davis added these estimated impacts to his
valuation, with the exception of those events that would lead to a project delay before
ramp-up which were modeled separately in his valuation, and made the same adjustments

to these additional costs that he also made for the other capital and operating costs.!°*”

1547.Prof. Davis further explained that he classified those risks for which Claimant had not
quantified a financial impact in three categories and made separate adjustments for each

category: (i) events that could lead to early termination were addressed by assuming an
annual 0.5% probability of early shut down; (ii) events that could cause project delays
before construction were addressed by assuming that it would take, on average, 3.8 years
from the valuation date (or 5.3 years from the completion of the Feasibility Study) until
the start of construction; and (iii) risks that could cause temporary interruption of
operations would have been addressed either by the planned activities in the risk register
or the insurance policies taken out by Barrick and/or Claimant. Prof. Davis noted that the
adjustments he had made for these asymmetric risks reduced the value of Claimant’s
investment by approximately USD 3.4 billion.'°4* Further explanations regarding the
individual adjustments made for each category of asymmetric risks were provided in
Appendix D to Prof. Davis’ first report.

1548.The Tribunal notes that it has already addressed these adjustments as well as the
arguments raised by Respondent and its experts in this regard. Specifically, the Tribunal
has already addressed both the 0.5% annual probability of an early mine shut down and
Prof. Davis’ reference to business interruption insurance that Claimant was planning to
purchase in the context of its discussion whether Prof. Davis had adequately quantified
residual security-related risks. The Tribunal has also addressed the average delay modeled
by Prof. Davis until the start of construction in the context of the question whether
Claimant had a reasonable plan and schedule for obtaining the permits and approvals
required to construct and operate the project.

1549.However, the Tribunal has not yet assessed the more general argument raised by
Respondents and its experts that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis cannot be
considered sufficient to account for the country risk affecting the project. In the opinion
of Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, the country risk should be reflected in the discount
rate applied to the cash flows of the project, which would lead to a fair market value of

that would actually be applied by a potential investor in 2011 would be above 30%, there
is no need to choose an exact number to understand that the project would attract no
investor even if one accepts the optimistic assumptions on which the SNC-Lavalin reports
are based.” They also referred to Dr. Burrows’ calculation of a discount rate of 23% for
Pakistan and added that “[n]o doubt, given the higher risks facing an investor in
Balochistan than in Pakistan in general, the actual discount rate, or hurdle rate, used by
a potential buyer would be higher than that. Still, even if a potential buyer were to accept

a rate considerably lower than 23%, the SNC-Lavalin report shows that the project is

unattractive to a buyer.”'9°°

1550.Prof. Davis responded to this criticism in his second report by emphasizing that country
risk is an example of asymmetric risk and maintaining that “[t]he appropriate way to take
these risks into account is to directly adjust the cash flow components affected by these
risks such that the cash flows reflect the statistically expected, or average outcome.” In
his opinion, Respondent’s experts “instead arbitrarily increase the discount rate to try to
account for the valuation effects of asymmetric risks.”'?>' Prof. Davis noted that they did
not provide any quantification of the risks they had discussed in their first report “other
than the impact of a single, catch-all country risk premium that would raise the traditional
DCF risk-adjusted discount rate to above 30%.” As he did not use the traditional DCF
method, Prof. Davis considered that “the idea of using a 30% discount rate does not apply
to [his] analysis” and added that this measure of country risk would in any event be “‘ad-

hoc and excessive even within the traditional DCF model.”!°>

1551.Prof. Davis quantified the adjustments he had made for asymmetric risks as follows: (i)
higher expected capital expenditures, operating costs, and closure costs needed to
mitigate the asymmetric risks identified by Claimant in its risk register, reducing the value
of Claimant’s investment by USD 0.5 billion; (ii) projected operational interruptions and
consequent decreased annual production, including the additional adjustment for a 24-
month ramp-up that he made in his second report based on the expert opinion of Mr.
Cusworth, reducing the value of Claimant’s investment by USD 0.6 billion; (iii) projected
delays prior to or during construction causing additional costs, additional cost inflation
and delays in the receipt of revenues, reducing the value of Claimant’s investment by
USD 1.3 billion; and (iv) a chance of a permanent shutdown of the project and subsequent
loss of all cash flows except closure costs, reducing the value of Claimant’s investment
by USD 1.6 billion. As already addressed in the context of the adjustments made to capital
and operating cost estimates, Prof. Davis also referred to an escalation of construction
and operational costs based on forecasts for the mining industry, reducing the value of
Claimant’s investment by a further USD 2.1 billion. In total Prof. Davis specified that his
adjustments for asymmetric risk reduced the value of Claimant’s investment from USD
14.7 billion to USD 8.5 billion. !°>

1552.Prof. Davis further did not agree with Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells that the value of
the project turned negative when applying a discount rate above 13.2%, noting that they

had derived this figure from the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study which,
besides being a calculation in a technical study rather than a valuation, had not been
updated to the valuation date. Prof. Davis then presented such an update of the calculation
reflecting conditions at the valuation date which yielded a net present value of USD 4.03
billion for the project and USD 3.02 billion for Claimant’s 75% share, implying an
internal rate of return of 18.5%.'°*+ Prof. Davis further rejected the suggestion of a hurdle
rate and/or discount rate of 30% as both unsupported and contradicted by Claimant’s
previous investment decisions and further explained why he considered that Dr. Burrows’
method of determining country risk based on Pakistan’s sovereign yield spread was not

appropriate in the present case.!°°>

1553.In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells maintained their opinion that Prof.
Davis’ model “completely disregards the notion of country risk,” arguing that “the
alleged risk adjustment in the cash flows [is] Brattle’s ‘fudge factor’ and one that is

ridiculously low.” They rejected the argument that they were double-counting risk, noting
that “one cannot double count risks when none are accounted for in the first place.”!°°®
In their opinion, Prof. Davis’ model implies a discount rate of only 4.2%, arguing that
when all risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis are excluded, cash flows are only USD
3.3 billion higher (as opposed to USD 4.0 billion as claimed by Prof. Davis) than with his
risk adjustments. Noting that this implied discount rate was only 1.2% above the risk-free

rate applied by Prof. Davis, Respondent’s experts considered this calculation as proof that

Prof. Davis did not make more than “negligible” risk adjustments.'°°7

1554. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells discussed several decisions involving Venezuela in which
they had participated as economic experts for the respondent and in which arbitral
tribunals had considered it appropriate to apply a country risk premium of 15.75% or a
discount rate of 19.88% and 18%, respectively.!°°* In their opinion, Prof. Davis’ model
has not otherwise accounted for the risks incorporated in such country risk premiums:

'954 At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis presented a revised calculation of this updated value based on the
Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study in which he had corrected an error identified in his preparation for the Hearing.
This correction was subject to an extended debate between the Parties at the Hearing on Quantum and will be
addressed in more detail in the context of the Tribunal’s verification of its conclusion on the value of Claimant's
investment taking into account the updated calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study presented by Prof.
Davis.

“Brattle’s model is little more than the traditional DCF with revenues valued
at Brattle’s projections of futures prices, which it paradoxically labels as
‘certainty-equivalent’ notwithstanding their being higher than the Consensus
Economics forecasts —which presumably incorporate risk— and an
extremely low discount rate. That is not ‘modern’; it is manipulation of a
methodology with an inaccurate description of what was actually done.
Going through the motions and saying that one ‘followed the valuation rules’
and has ‘treated risk at its source’ does not mean that there are rules which
allow one to see clearly what is going to happen in the far future, allowing
one to eliminate uncertainty, especially in a region such as Balochistan. As
Keynes and Knight have stated, uncertainty is a concept that is not amenable
to probability calculations. But the fact that uncertainty cannot be assigned
probabilities does not mean that it does not exist. To repeat, ‘there are things
we don't know we don’t know.” The ‘irreducible uncertain’ cannot be
avoided. How can anyone, not just Brattle, measure the uncertainty involved
in the ‘known unknowns’ and, even worse, the ‘unknown unknowns’ ?

In sum, there is no way that the equivalent of adding 1.2% to the risk-free
discount rate in a conventional DCF calculation can possibly account for the
risks and uncertainty facing this project in Balochistan. It would not even be
sufficient for the risks in a similar project in Canada or Australia.”'°?

1555.As the above quoted paragraphs as well as other passages of Mr. Brailovsky's and Prof.
Wells’ opinion demonstrate, they generally call into question whether it is possible to
determine “certainty-equivalent” cash flows, i.e., to adjust cash flows for all relevant
risks, including country risk, at source. Respondent even considers it accepted by Prof.
Davis that the cash flows he determined in his model are not “certainty-equivalent” but
instead “highly uncertain and highly risky” which, in Respondent’s view, “makes any
reliance on the ‘de-risked’ approach yielding the certainty-equivalent FMV of USD 8.5
million misguided.”!° The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument. In particular, the
Tribunal does not understand the concept of “certainty-equivalent” cash flows to mean
that a buyer would expect that he would receive this specific amount of cash flows at no
risk. Rather, the buyer would be assuming the undisputedly significant level of risk
associated with constructing and operating the project at Reko Diq; in return, however,
the buyer would also acquire the chance of receiving much higher cash flows than the
“certainty-equivalent” amount calculated by Prof. Davis. As Prof. Davis has explained in
detail and as the 2012 CIMVal report confirms, the concept of “certainty equivalent” cash
flows is based on the notion that the risk affecting a particular cash flow is monetized and
directly incorporated into the calculation of that cash flow instead of being reflected in an
aggregate discount rate.

1556.In fact, Prof. Davis explained already in his second report:

“There is no doubt that Reko Diq’s development plan was subject to
asymmetric risks, systematic risks, and unsystematic risks. It may seem
counterintuitive that the Project’s risky future cash flows could be made
equivalent to cash flows that are certain, but it is no different than the notion
of fair market value itself — the FMV is the certain, or fixed, amount that a
buyer or seller is accepting now in exchange for the uncertain, or variable,
stream of future cash flows that the asset will generate. The FMV is the
‘certaintyequivalent’ value of the asset itself. Both the traditional DCF and
modern DCF produce an estimate of this FMV, they just come to that FMV
via different approaches to discounting for systematic risk.”'°°!

1557.For the reasons set out in detail in its assessment of the modern DCF valuation method,

the Tribunal is convinced that it is generally appropriate to value the Reko Diq project
based on the concept of certainty-equivalent cash flows and neither of the arguments
raised by Respondent and its experts cause it to reach a different conclusion. Pursuant to
the concept presented by Prof. Davis, the asymmetric risks affecting the project, including
county-related risks, should not be reflected in the discount rate as they would be in a
traditional DCF calculation but rather in individual risk adjustments made to the cash
flows themselves.

1558. However, the question remains whether the asymmetric risk and in particular those risks

1961
1962
1963

that would be reflected in a country risk premium applied to the discount rate in a
traditional DCF calculation have been fully captured by Prof. Davis’ risk adjustments at
source. At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis presented a list of the country-related
risks that he accounted for in his model.'*°? As became clear through this list as well as
through Prof. Davis’ explanations, he did not identify any of those risks himself but rather
relied on the risks identified in the residual risk register that Claimant had appended to
the Feasibility Study and continued to update until the valuation date.'°* The Tribunal
notes that neither Respondent nor its experts identified any specific country-related risks
which were not included in the risk register but which, in their opinion, should have been
included and quantified by Prof. Davis in his model. With the exception of the risk of a
“[d]irect violent attack incountry by any hostile force resulting in injuries, death, business
disruption,” they also did not raise a substantiated challenge to the specific quantification
of any particular risk that Prof. Davis presented in his reports. This applies both to the
risks for which Claimant quantified a financial impact and to the risks for which Claimant

did not identify a financial impact and Prof. Davis modeled an impact based on his
classification of these risks in the three categories referred to above.

1559. First, the category of risks that could cause early termination of the project included the
risk of a “[d]irect violent attack incountry by any hostile force resulting in injuries, dealth,
business disruption,” which has already been addressed in detail above, as well as the risk

71964 Which Prof. Davis was instructed to exclude in his valuation.

of “nationalization,
The Tribunal found above that the risk adjustment made by Prof. Davis for the security-
related risk of a direct violent attack was not sufficient and should be increased based on
his own reliance on OPIC insurance values for this purpose. The Tribunal further
considers that it has not been provided with any basis to conclude that a further adjustment
is warranted to account for other risks in this category and specifically the risk of
“nationalization.”

1560. While there is disagreement between the Parties and their experts as to whether it was
appropriate for Claimant to instruct Prof. Davis to exclude the risk of nationalization from
his valuation, neither Respondent nor its experts have argued that the risk of
nationalization would have been significant and, thus, that its inclusion would have had
a measurable impact on the value of Claimant’s investment as of the valuation date. To
the contrary, as pointed out by Claimant, the committee formed by Pakistan for the
negotiation of the Mineral Agreement assured Claimant during a meeting held on 8-9
September 2008 “about stability, concept and continuity of the policy towards investment
of the company in future as no untoward incident of expropriation had ever occurred in

Pakistan.”'°%

1561.Claimant’s witness Ms. Boggs testified during the liability phase that while performing
due diligence and country risk analysis for a possible acquisition of claimant in 2006, she
“also considered the history of foreign investment in Pakistan and found no incidents in
which foreign investors’ interests had been expropriated and nationalized.” Similarly,
Mr. Luksic testified that he had been told at the time that “although there had been
frequent changes between civilian and military Governments, and the political situation
had often been volatile, foreign investments had not been expropriated and the different

Governments had generally respected the law.”'°°"

1562.Respondent’s expert Dr. Burrows expressed the opinion that “[t]he risk of expropriation
is a business risk that a hypothetical buyer would take into account and is a risk that
would have been knowingly undertaken by the owners of TCC.” He did not, however,

quantify that risk but only stated that “[i]t is unlikely that unlawful actions by Respondent
would account for much, if any, of the gap between Professor Davis’ 0.5% annual loss
probability and my estimates of Pakistan PRS of 4.6-8.2%, nor that the risk of unlawful
actions changed drastically from 2006 to 2011.”!°°8 Similarly, Respondent and its experts
Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells argued that the risk of expropriation should be included
in the determination of country risk, but did not provide any quantification of that risk.!°°
In particular, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, while referring to the decisions of arbitral
tribunals regarding the country risk of Venezuela, did not express any opinion as to the
level of risk of uncompensated expropriation or other unlawful actions prevailing in
Pakistan as of the valuation date.

1563. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding on whether it was correct as
a matter of law to exclude the general risk of unlawful actions from a valuation of
Claimant’s investment because, in any event, it has not been established that a buyer
would have considered this a significant risk from a factual point of view.

1564. Second, the category of risks that could cause project start-up delay includes the risks of
“Delays in financing due to lenders review of ESIA results,” “petty corruption resulting
in delays and expenses,” “Cross border consultation & mitigation in Afghanistan caused
by the use of water sources resulting in schedule delay and/or community/government
opposition or demands,” “Unfavourable perceptions/interests of our project by local
stakeholders,” “Inability to negotiate Mineral Agreement,” “Delay in ESIA submittal due
to changes in the project description, resulting in a delay of the project,” “Failure to
secure all required permits in good time resulting in project delay,” and “Water usage by
project causes drawdowns that have impacts in Iran resulting in diplomatic
challenges.”!°”°

1565.The Tribunal has already addressed most of these risks and the Parties’ arguments with
regard to the issues reflected in those risk items above. Based on its findings with regard
to water, security, environmental and social impacts, permitting and the negotiation of a
Mineral Agreement, the Tribunal is convinced that these risks are adequately captured in
the delay modeled by Prof. Davis. Based on a review of the 100 largest deposits as of
2011 and the average time period between completion of the feasibility study and the start
of construction for these deposits, Prof. Davis modeled in his simulations that it would
take, on average, 5.3 years from completion of the Feasibility Study in August 2010 to
the start of construction. As the Tribunal has already stated in the context of its assessment
on whether likely permitting delays were sufficiently accounted in Prof. Davis’ model,

Respondent has not raised any substantiated challenge to Prof. Davis’ modeling of these
delays and the Tribunal therefore sees no basis to assume that they would not have been
considered sufficient by a buyer to account for the risks identified above as of the
valuation date.

1566. Third, the category of risks that could cause temporary interruption includes the risks of
“TCC Security staff Implicated in human rights abuses resulting in reputational damage,”
“Criminal extortion & kidnap caused by criminal groups possibly resulting in personnel
harm, reputational and financial loss,” and “Theft of explosives & blasting accessories -
linked to CPL13 leading to restrictions on our ability to operate, disruptions and

reputational and financial loss.”'°"!

1567. The Tribunal has already addressed Prof. Davis’ modeling of these three security-related
risks above. Specifically, Prof. Davis explained that business interruptions lasting longer
than 30 days would be covered by business interruption insurance that Claimant was
planning to purchase (the premiums for which were included in his cost estimates) and
that he had adjusted production quantities to account for shorter interruption, which
would not be covered by insurance. Respondent and its experts did not challenge Prof.
Davis’ approach to these risks and the Tribunal therefore sees no basis to conclude that
the adjustments made by Prof. Davis were not sufficient for the purposes of determining
the impact of business interruptions.

d. Whether a Different Conclusion Is Warranted by Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof.
Wells’ Argument That the Implied Discount Rate Is Too Low

1568. The Tribunal notes, however, that Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells raised the more general
argument that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis for asymmetric risk cannot be
considered sufficient because they amount to only USD 3.3 billion and thereby imply a
discount rate of 4.2%, i.e., only 1.2% above the risk-free rate.

1569. At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis disagreed with the calculation of the implied
discount rate made by Respondent’s experts in their second report and referred to an

illustration of the risk adjustments made in his presentation: !°”

1570.Prof. Davis went on to explain why, in his opinion, the calculation made by Mr.

Brailovsky and Prof. Wells was incomplete:

“What Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells attempted to do is, on the right-
hand side, starting at the bottom box, they attempted to unwind my discount
for asymmetric and Project risk. So, they attempted to adjust my cash flows
upwards to the middle box. And then I believe they thought they had taken all
the risks out of the Project, including systematic risk, or all the valuations of
the risks. I don't want to say they took the risks out. So, I think they believe
they got all the way up to the top box, and then they said--what Discount Rate
do I need to use to bring that top right box all the way down to the bottom left
box? And they come up with 4.1 percent. If they use 4.1 percent, they get 8.5
billion. The problem is, they didn't get all the way to the top box because they
didn't unwind the systematic risk-discounting, and, in fact, they didn't get all
the way up to the middle box because they didn't unwind my ramp-up
adjustment, which was about USD.6 billion. So, they unwound the cash flows
for risk up to maybe the bottom of the middle box and then calculated what
equivalent Discount Rate would be needed to bring it back to the bottom left,
and they came up with 4.2 percent, something like that. That's my inference
of what they did in that calculation.”!°”

1571.In response to the question what information would be required in order to calcula
discount rate implied in his calculation, Prof. Davis explained:

“Well, you could start by completely unwinding all the asymmetric Project
risks, in particular, take the ramp-out up. That would get to you to a little bit
of a higher cash flow, and that would require more than a 4.1 percent
Discount Rate to bring it back. But then you would need to go further because
you would need to go and estimate the actual spot prices for copper, gold,
and oil that the Project would be exposed to. That's that red box at the top.
You'd need to somehow estimate that, and then you're back to the parallel.

We talked about the parallel. I'm not sure which of the arbitrators asked, but
we're back to the parallel where you have the complete risk cash flows that
you would normally discount and what discount would bring it back. We know
it's going to be higher than 4.1 percent. It's impossible to say what it would
be without actually doing the exercise.

Q. And are you aware of any reliable information that exists to fill in that top
right box?

A. No. One certainly can't use--as I've argued, one certainly can't use the
analyst forecasts. One of the reasons that this modern approach has gained
traction and is demanded by industry is because it obviates that need to
calculate that unknowable number. We have models. Make no mistake, we
have models about what that might be, but we've gotten to the point now in
modern finance where we don't even talk about that top right box anymore
because it's not of interest. We don't need it. And so that modeling effort is
largely going by the wayside.”'°7*
1572.The Tribunal notes that while Prof. Davis argued that the implied discount rate calculated
by Respondent’s experts did not take into account all of the risk adjustments he had made,
he did not provide an alternative figure which would, in his opinion, correspond to the
overall implied discount rate. The main reason for Prof. Davis’ decision not to present
such a figure apparently is that he did not make an assumption as to the non-risk-adjusted
prices for copper, gold and oil and therefore did not quantify the systematic risk
adjustment he had made through his direct assumption of risk-adjusted prices. He stated
that “to compute the correct Discount Rate to bring us back to 8.5, if we assume that's the
number that we are trying to get, I would need to start with ... an estimate of the cash
flows in that question mark red box in the top right. And I don't have that because that
was not necessary for my analysis. I started with the certain equivalent cash flows.” Prof.
Davis added that while he “could do the exercise,” he had not done so because it was not
necessary to estimate the non-risk-adjusted cash flows for his analysis and, therefore,
neither he nor the Tribunal had the numerics to make a calculation of the implied discount

rate.!°75

1573. However, Prof. Davis also argued that Respondent’s experts did not even account for all
of the asymmetric risk adjustments he had made and referred in particular to the
adjustment made for the longer ramp-period he modeled in his second report. To the
extent that asymmetric risk is concerned, Prof. Davis did not state that it would be
impossible or even difficult to calculate the premium implied by the country-related risk
adjustments he made in his model. However, apart from stating that it would be higher
than the premium of 1.2% calculated by Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, he did not
provide any quantification or indication of what would have been the risk premium

implied by his adjustments. Respondent’s experts in turn did not engage in substance with
Prof. Davis’ criticism that their calculation did not back out all of the relevant asymmetric
(and systematic) risks and did not present an alternative calculation that would also back
out the ramp-up delays; they maintained their opinion that the implied discount rate was
only 4.2%.'°”° Prof. Wells further testified at the Hearing on Quantum:

“IT note that Professor Davis disagrees somewhat with the number ‘4.2
percent.’ We can defend the number, but let's say that we're wrong by 50
percent. That gives a Discount Rate or a profitability of a little more than 6
percent. Clearly, no investor is going to put up 8.5 billion to earn a little more
than 6 percent in Balochistan.”

1574. Mr. Brailovsky further expanded on why they considered their calculation of the implied
discount rate to be correct:

“Scenario 6, which purports to show his model without any of the systematic,
nonsystematic risks included. So, we just took his Scenario 6, which is where
he reincorporates all the risks that he adopted. So, we will say that we have,
with this scenario, a traditional DCF because the risks are not adopted in the
cash flows. So, if we take that scenario and assume that the hypothetical
Buyer is going to pay 8.5 billion, well, the Rate of Return would be 4.2
percent.

Now, I say ‘traditional’ because there is still the systematic risk. Now, we
understand that--and if we look at one of the schematics in Professor Davis's
presentation, where you have the first block, which is the unknown revenue
including all the risks, and then you take that--you take those risks down to
what you have, what you would have is an NPV without the systematic risks.

Now, if we do that by using you know, the consensus economics, which
presumably has all the risks in, the problem is that the consensus economics
revenues would be below, not above us, as in that scheme, but below. And we
know that, if they are below that, the NPV, even at the 3 percent risk-free rate
would be zero. So, if we try to do a full traditional, we would have to deduct-

1575. As reiterated by Mr. Brailovsky in his oral testimony, the calculation of the implied
discount rate made by Respondent’s experts was based on a comparison of two scenarios
in Prof. Davis’ updated valuation model submitted together with his second report.
Specifically, they compared Scenario 1, which is labelled “NPI, Renewal, 2% Royalty,
EPZ, Risk Adjustments,” with Scenario 6, which is labelled “No Asymmetric Risk
Adjustments.” !°” As noted by Respondent’s experts, damages to Claimant are calculated

to amount to USD 8.49 billion in Scenario | and USD 11.79 billion in Scenario 6.'°*° On
that basis, they concluded that the risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis in fact amounted
only to USD 3.3 billion and not USD 6 billion as stated in his reports and at the Hearing
on Quantum.

1576. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent’s experts that, judging from the label of Scenario
6, i.e., “No Asymmetric Risk Adjustments,” it would appear that the difference between
the amounts calculated in Scenarios 1 and 6, respectively, should indeed reflect the
entirety of the asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis. However, the Tribunal
notes that Prof. Davis also included a Scenario 11, which is labelled “No Political
Violence Risk (0.5%),” and a Scenario 12, which is labelled “No Residual Risk.'8! This
indicates that Prof. Davis quantified the impact of his assumption regarding a 0.5% annual
probability of early shutdown as well as residual cost risks quantified in Claimant’s risk
register separately. Comparing these Scenarios to Scenario 1, Prof. Davis made additional
adjustments of USD 1,423 million and USD 505 million, respectively. This also
corresponds to the description he provided of these risk adjustments in his second
report.!°*? Given that, in particular, the risk of political violence has also been
characterized as an asymmetric and, more specifically, a country-related risk, this
confirms that the implied discount rate calculated by Respondent’s experts does not in
fact reflect all relevant asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis.

1577.As neither expert has provided the Tribunal with a number of what would be the risk
premium reflecting all of the asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis, the
Tribunal has no basis to draw a comparison to the figures discussed by the Parties’ experts
with regard to what they would have considered an adequate country risk premium in a
traditional DCF calculation. The same applies to the consideration of an overall implied
discount rate which would undisputedly have required to remove the adjustments for
systematic risk as well. While Mr. Brailovsky reiterated the opinion that no actual
adjustment for systematic risk was made when considering that the non-risk-adjusted
prices projected by Consensus Economics were lower than the risk-adjusted prices
derived by Prof. Davis form the futures and forward markets, the Tribunal notes that it
has already addressed this argument above and reached the conclusion that it was
generally plausible for Prof. Davis to rely on futures and forward market data but that an
additional adjustment accounting for the long-term risk and additional uncertainty created
by the extrapolation of market data has to be made. Consequently, and in light of the
Tribunal’s acceptance of Prof. Davis’ approach to the application of the DCF method, it
is not necessary for the Tribunal to express an opinion as to the disagreement between the

Parties’ experts concerning an appropriate discount rate and/or country risk premium for
a traditional DCF valuation of Claimant’s investment.

e. Whether a Different Conclusion Is Warranted by the Comparison Drawn by
Mr. Brailoysky and Prof. Wells to the Cash Flows Calculated in the Expansion
Pre-Feasibility Study

1578. As an additional argument supporting their opinion that the risk adjustments made by
Prof. Davis were insignificant and that his valuation resulted in a positive net present
value of Claimant’s investment only because he did not apply an appropriate discount
rate, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells presented a comparison of the revenues and costs
estimated by Prof. Davis in his model with the revenues and costs estimated in the
Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, which were undidsputedly made for the purposes of a
traditional DCF calculation. In their opinion, the comparison showed a “striking and
revealing” similarity between the two calculations, which warranted the conclusion “that
both are in reality traditional and that the only decisive driver of differences in valuation
is the discount rate.”'°*? They illustrated this alleged similarity with the following

1579. As indicated in the legend to the graph, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells made certain
adjustments or “normalizations” to the figures included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study in their second report. They had already presented a similar comparison and graph
in their first report to support their argument that the difference in value yielded by both
calculations was “almost entirely attributable to the different discount rates used in the

two studies.”'°%

1580.Prof. Davis responded to this comparison in his second report by emphasizing that the
comparison had been made based on a reduction of the revenues in the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study by 20%.'°*° In fact, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells had noted in the
footnote to the graph in their Figure 2 that “[flor the purpose of constructing the graph,
the SNC-Lavalin real rates were converted into nominal discount rates in order to make
them comparable to the results of the Brattle model. There are of course differences
between the SNC-Lavalin pre-feasibility study model and the Brattle model, but it is
nonetheless remarkable that these offset each other as shown in Figure 2. The offset is
almost perfect if one assumes, as in the figure, the SNC-Lavalin scenario with metal

prices about 20% below the base assumption.” !°8”

1581.Prof. Davis argued in response that “as a conceptual matter, given any two numbers A
and B, one can always find some factor by which to adjust A until it equals B. It is a
tautology, not a proof that the numbers were the same to begin with, akin to saying that
100 and 80 are the same number because, after adjusting 100 down by 20%, it is the same
as 80.” Prof. Davis further considered that “when the 20% adjustment is removed from
their calculation, the two NPVs that they calculate are not particularly close,” which he

illustrated as follows:!°8

Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells responded to this argument and graph by noting that “[i]t
is not surprising that the two models yield different results if one uses much higher prices
than the other.” In their opinion, however, “[t]he real test is whether or not they perform
approximately the same at the same prices,” which they had shown to be the case.” They
further explained that “[t]he use in our first report of a SNC-Lavalin scenario with prices
20% below the central scenario was meant as a short cut to compensate for the fact that
real output prices in the SNCLavalin are indeed higher than those of Brattle and that the
former does not include the government equity take and risk adjustments” and added that
“[iJn any case, Table 3 and Graph 5 above dispose of Brattle’s criticism as they come
from a rigorous comparison of the two models. We are left with the corollary that
Brattle’s approach is a traditional calculation disguised as ‘modern,’ a disguise that

allegedly justifies the use of a riskfree discount rate.”!°*

1583.Respondent’s experts emphasized that in this revised, “strictly construed comparison of

the two models,” they had now relied on the central price scenario of the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study. With regard to the “normalized” scenario they had used as a basis for
their comparison, they explained that “[i]n order to improve comparability, ... we adjust
the gross revenue of the SNC-Lavalin study to be equal to that of the Brattle report, and
add the government equity take and the risk adjustment for early termination. This results
in an undiscounted net cash flow of US$10.1 billion.” In their opinion, the remaining
difference to Prof. Davis’ model likely resulted from the fact that the Expansion Pre-

Feasibility Study did not include “Brattle’s allowance for risk with financial impact that

was not quantified by TCC, which is of a similar magnitude.”!°°°

1584.At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Brailovsky confirmed his explanation that the
comparison made in their first report had been a “rough-and-ready calculation,” using
the lower prices scenario to account for the 25% equity share of the GOB as well as the
fact that “strangely enough, the prices in the SNC are higher than in the Brattle report.”
He pointed out that the prices in the original version of the central price scenario reported

1585.Mr. Brailovsky further explained their approach to “normalizing” the central price
scenario in column 3 of the same table:

“Now, obviously you can obtain very different results if your costs are, more
or less, the same. And you can see here the expenditures in the Brattle. And

1999 Brailovsky/Wells II, {f 81, 86.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -528-

the expenditures in the SNC-Lavalin are different but not that much; whereas,
the Capex is higher. The Opex is lower.

So, what happens if you have the same costs but different prices? Obviously,
you get very different results. So, really, what is important is to normalize the
SNC-Lavalin to the prices in the Brattle Report.

And this is exactly what we did. You can see that the gross revenue is 64,953,
in the first column, and 64,953 in the second column--in the third column.

So, they are exactly the same. Now, I don't--I didn't move the costs. The costs
are the same. I included an estimate of the 25 equity government take, and
the result is NPV undiscounted of 10.2, a little bit higher than the Brattle
Report.

So, actually, when you really do a strict comparison--and this is a strict
comparison, and Professor Davis didn't contest this calculation--you will see
that, on similar terms, actually, the SNC-Lavalin is a little bit higher than the
Brattle Report.

And the curves in the Second Report, which are on Page 43, Graph 5, are
obtained from Column 3, which is a normalized SNC, normalized to two
things: The same income and introducing the Government equity.

Summarizing, costs are basically the same when expressing the same terms.
So, whatever Professor Davis did with the costs only increased them by about
900 million undiscounted. Whatever his corrections, it's just a little bit higher
than the original SNC calculation.

Now, the prices have to be the same, so you can calculate one thing or the

other; otherwise, you can do whatever with the prices. But at the same prices,

the two are very similar, and discounted at 3 percent one will give you about

USD 9 billion. Discounted at 13 percent, both of will give you zero.”!°

1586. Mr. Braillovsky confirmed that the revenues in the original central price scenario of the

Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study were “about 3.5 billion higher’ than in Prof. Davis’
model and that the normalization they had carried out “‘set the revenues equal to each
other.” When asked whether he had thereby assumed away any systematic risk
adjustment made by Prof. Davis in his prices, Mr. Brailovsky testified:

“That was not really--what you're interested in is the final output of the--final

result of your analysis.

Q. So, you think you can just assume away one significant difference and then
say the models come to the same thing, so they have to be the same?

A. (Mr. Brailovsky) As I said, it is very easy to play around with prices
because nobody knows them; right?

Q. That's exactly what you did.

A. (Mr. Brailovsky) Nobody knows them. So, it's very easy to play around with
those, especially when you're in the context of modeling real terms for 50
years. So, even though the Brattle Report seems to have prices much higher
than the SNC, they don't because of the--once you put them in real terms, it
just goes down. And that I show in the graphs in this section.

You have to normalize. You have to compare one thing with the other.
Revenues are revenues, and you have to put them on the same basis.”'°?

1587. Mr. Brailovsky reiterated that when setting the prices equal to each other, it became clear
that the costs were very similar in both models and “the difference in valuation is basically
the Discount Rate, however you want to characterize the modern or nonmodern.” He
emphasized that, contrary to Prof. Davis statement that he had included considerably
higher costs, the comparison at equal prices show that the costs “are almost the same.”!°°*

Mr. Brailovsky explicitly confirmed that his calculation had assumed away the difference

of USD 3.8 billion in revenues between the original central price scenario and Prof.

Davis’ model and that he “wasn’t trying to test for [the] proposition” made by Prof. Davis

that his prices were adjusted for systematic risk.!°°°

1588. With regard to the costs that he had described as “almost the same” in both models, Mr.
Brailovsky clarified that this applied “[i]n aggregate” given that, while Prof. Davis’
capital costs were indeed higher by 36% in real terms, his operating costs were in fact
lower than the corresponding cost estimate of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. As
already addressed above, he accepted that oil prices accounted for about 40% of the
operating expenses but questioned Claimant’s proposition that “simulating and using
risk-adjusted prices in the forecast for oil” could lead to a lower cost estimate, as he
“would expect the price of oil in the risk-adjusted to be higher than the other one, no?

Because if you include risk there, you should be above the other one.”'°°6

1589. Mr. Brailovsky further confirmed that when also taking into account additional “[o]ther”
expenses included by Prof. Davis as well as his adjustment for early termination, the
difference between the two models before his normalization, including the government
take, amounted to USD 6.7 billion. He did not agree with Claimant that the difference
after adjustment for the government take still amounted to about USD 5.6 billion, arguing
that the government take would in fact be higher and lead to a difference of only USD 4.6
billion between the two models. He agreed that “[n]ondiscounted, yes,” this still
amounted to a material difference but maintained that “any reasonable Discount Rate will

make this difference almost disappear.”'!°*"

1590.Based on Mr. Brailovsky’s testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, it is clear to the
Tribunal that the comparison drawn to the “normalized” calculation in the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study cannot provide any verification as to whether or not Prof. Davis made
adequate adjustments to account for systematic risk. Mr. Brailovsky readily stated that he
had assumed away any difference in prices by setting the revenues equal to each other in
both calculations. As pointed out by Claimant, however, the fact that there was a
considerable difference in revenues between the original central price scenario and Prof.
Davis’ model indicates that Prof. Davis’ prices indeed reflect a systematic risk
adjustment. In this regard, the Tribunal also takes into account that the price assumptions
in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study dated from 2010 and it is undisputed that price
expectations rose during the time period until the valuation date in November 2011.
Consequently, it is plausible to assume that if Mr. Brailovsky had updated the non-risk-
adjusted price assumptions in the Expansion Pre-Feasibiluty Study, as Prof. Davis has
done in his second report which will be addressed in more detail below, the difference in
revenues would have been even larger than reflected in Mr. Brailovsky’s Table 3. In these
circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the comparison to the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study cannot provide any justification for deviating from the Tribunal’s
conclusion above that Prof. Davis’ approach to systematic risk was generally appropriate
and that the result only has to be adjusted to account for the additional uncertainty
associated with the 56-year life of the mine.

1591.Mr. Brailovsky’s testimony clarified that what he had attempted to show with this
comparison was that the aggregate costs estimated by Prof. Davis did not significantly
differ from the cost estimate of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. This concerns the
asymmetric risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis. As the comparison makes clear,
however, the capital costs estimated by Prof. Davis are in fact considerably higher (USD
10.845 billion as opposed to USD 7.948 billion in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study)
and correspond to the 36% risk adjustment in real terms that he presented in his reports.
As pointed out by Mr. Brailovsky, this cost increase was offset to a large extent by the
lower operating cost estimate (USD 23.661 billion as opposed to USD 26.045 billion in
the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study). The Tribunal has already addressed this particular
aspect of the comparison between the two calculations, which apparently resulted from
the fact that Prof. Davis assumed a lower oil price than the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study, and it concluded for the reasons set out in detail above that this did not warrant
any further adjustment beyond the deduction it considers appropriate in the context of
Prof. Davis’ reliance on forward market data. The Tribunal again notes, however, that
neither the price assumptions, including for oil, nor the other operating expenes estimated
in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study were updated by Mr. Brailovsky to the valuation
date. This serves as another reason why the Tribunal does not consider it justified to draw

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 542 of 1447
Award
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -531-

any deviating conclusion from the comparison of operating expenses in the two
calculations.

1592. Finally, the Tribunal notes that, as Mr. Brailovsky confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum,
the comparison he had made showed that the cash flows modeled by Prof. Davis before
accounting for the 25% stake of the GOB were almost USD 6.7 billion lower than those
estimated in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study (even without updating the latter to the
valuation date). While there was slight disagreement as to amount to be deducted for the
25% stake of the GOB in the case of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, Mr. Brailovsky
confirmed that the difference still amounted to at least USD 4.6 billion between the two
calculations.

1593.The Tribunal notes that Mr. Brailovsky continued to argue that this difference would
“almost disappear” when applying “any reasonable Discount Rate” to the cash flows
accruing 20 years into the future. The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument,
however. As has been addressed in detail above, the concept of the modern DCF model
applied by Prof. Davis is based on making adjustments for risk affecting the individual
cash flows at source rather than the application of a discount rate reflecting those risks.
The Tribunal further recalls that the comparison was made by Mr. Brailovsky in order to
show that the risk adjustments that Prof. Davis had made to the cash flows were not
significant, thus did not fully capture the risks associated with the project and therefore
did not justify discounting these cash flows at the risk-free rate. However, it would be
circular to establish the absence of significant risk adjustments by arguing that any
differences in value that might reflect such risk adjustments would disappear when
applying a risk-adjusted discount rate. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant and Prof. Davis
that this would amount to double-counting the same risks and be contrary to the modern
DCF valuation approach as described by Prof. Davis and the 2012 CIMVal report.

1594.Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the comparison to the traditional DCF
calculation made in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study does not warrant the conclusion
that Prof. Davis did not make significant risk adjustments to the cash flows in his model.
To the contrary, the significant difference between the net cash flow resulting from the
respective calculation convinces the Tribunal that Prof. Davis in fact did make significant
risk adjustments and that it would therefore not be appropriate to apply a discount rate to
these cash flows that would also reflect and thereby double-count the systematic and
asymmetric risks already reflected in Prof. Davis’ cash flows.

f. Whether Prof. Davis Has Appropriately Discounted the Cash Flows at the
Risk-Free Rate

1595. As a final point in determining whether Prof. Davis has appropriately discounted the cash
flows in his model, the Tribunal recalls that the 2012 CIMVal indicates that a “residual
risk adjustment may be necessary to adjust previously risk—adjusted cash flows for risk

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 543 of 1447

not explicitly recognized in the model before a final adjustment for the time value of
money.”'°°8 The Tribunal further noted that this would also apply to risks that were
recognized as such but for which the risk adjustments made are, in the Tribunal’s opinion,
insufficient to fully capture the relevant risk.

1596. The Tribunal has found above that the adjustments made by Prof. Davis for the systematic
risk of how the prices for copper, gold and oil would have developed over the 56-year life
of the mine were not sufficient and therefore warrant a further deduction of USD 2,430
million from the value of Claimant’s investment. The Tribunal further found that based
on Prof. Davis’ analysis, an amount of USD 130 million has to be deducted to account
for capital cost variability.

1597. Apart from these adjustments, the Tribunal does not see any basis for applying a further
residual risk adjustment for any risks not explicitly or not sufficiently recognized in Prof.
Davis’ model. Having reviewed all of the Parties’ expert reports and taking into account
the various adjustments to the value of Claimant’s investment at which the Tribunal has
already arrived, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent and its experts have not
identified and substantiated any additional risks that Prof. Davis should have, but failed
to, account for in his valuation model.

1598. Finally, as to the risk-free rate applied to account for the time value of money, Prof. Davis
explained that he used “the U.S. Treasury yield curve built from constant maturity rates
published by the Federal Reserve, interpolating linearly for maturities for which a rate
was unavailable.”!°”? Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells noted in their first report that the
discount rate assumed by Prof. Davis amounted to approximately 3% and added that
“Tt]he Brattle Report uses nominal discount rates starting at almost zero at the beginning
of the project and then rising to 3% in year 28, remaining fixed at that level thereafter.
The simple average is 2.7%.”?°°° Prof. Davis did not specifically confirm this calculation
but also referred to a nominal discount rate of 2.7% in the context of Mr. Brailovsky’s
and Prof. Wells’ comparison of his model with the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.?0?!

In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells again referred to a risk-free rate of

3% to which they also compared their calculation of an implied discount rate of 4.2% .7°

1599.In the absence of any challenge regarding the risk-free rate applied by Prof. Davis and

the Tribunal considers it undisputed that the risk-free rate
selected by Prof. Davis was appropriate to make the necessary adjustment for the time

value of money.

E. Conclusion of the Value of Claimant’s Investment Based on the Modern DCF
Valuation Approach Applied by Prof. Davis

1600. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that based on its review of the Parties’ submissions and
the evidence they submitted in support of their arguments, Claimant’s damages, which
Prof. Davis calculated at the amount of USD 8,490 million, must be reduced by an amount
of USD 1,843 million to account for the impact of the risks and issues raised by
Respondent regarding the feasibility of the project and/or the value of Claimant’s
investment. In addition, the Tribunal finds that further deductions in the amount of by
USD 2,560 million must be made to fully account for the systematic and asymmetric risks
affecting the project.

1601.On that basis, the Tribunal concludes that, based on the modern DCF valuation model of
Prof. Davis, the value of Claimant’s investment amounts to USD 4,087 million.

F. Verification of the Tribunal’s Conclusion on the Value of Claimant’s Investment

1602.Having reached its conclusion on the value of Claimant’s investment based on the
valuation method relied on by Prof. Davis, the Tribunal will now verify whether this
conclusion is reconcilable with the results yielded by other valuation or evaluation
methods relied on by Respondent’s experts in this arbitration or contemporaneously
applied by TCCA.

1. Summary of Claimant’s Position

1603.Claimant submits that Respondent has failed to present any credible valuation which
could have been compared with Prof. Davis’ modern DCF valuation but only submitted
“Dr. Burrows’s odd and unconvincing ‘prior transaction’ approach” which concluded
that the project was worth even less than in 2006 because Pakistan allegedly became
nearly five times riskier until 2011.70

1604. Claimant argues that the Hearing on Quantum revealed that, contrary to what Dr. Burrows
stated in his first report, he acted based on an undisclosed restrictive instruction which
contradicted his own views on mining valuation. Specifically, he testified that he was
instructed “to determine the value based on the 2006 transaction” and was “not instructed

to look at other potential avenues for valuing.” Respondent also confirmed that Dr.

Burrows was instructed “to please pursue that and not other things.”

1605.In Claimant’s view, it is “fundamentally unacceptable” that Dr. Burrows did not exercise
his own independent and professional judgment as to the correct valuation method and,
moreover, that he did not even disclose this instruction in his reports. Claimant adds that
given Dr. Burrows’ further testimony that in his experience, every transaction in the
mining industry he had seen had been based on a DCF valuation, his own “independent
judgment’ could only have led to the use of a DCF analysis rather than “this single,

outdated, incomparable transaction as the sole basis for valuation.”?°°

1606. Claimant contends that Dr. Burrows’ prior transaction analysis is “irredeemably flawed”

because the 2006 transaction is “simply not ‘comparable’” to the 2011 project, as
confirmed by the “massive adjustments” made by Dr. Burrows in his analysis. More
importantly, Claimant argues that Dr. Burrows’ analysis contradicts the “foundational
principle” of the value curve according to which “project value increases exponentially
as sponsors’ certainty about the underlying mineral resources and about the feasibility

of the mine plan increases.”?°""

1607.Claimant refers to Mr. Luksic’s testimony that Antofagasta bought “a promising
exploration project’ in 2006 but “much remained to be done to prove that the area’s
resources could be profitably mined” and that “with a lot of hard work—and some good
luck—this could be an outstanding project.” Claimant submits that over the following
years “TCC and its Owners did what was needed to prove the resource and to develop a
plan to mine it economically, transforming it form a mineral-resource-stage project to a

development-stage project.”?°*

1608.By contrast, Claimant emphasizes that Dr. Burrows’s analysis assumes that the work
carried out by Claimant and “all the capital and skill TCC poured into the project” added
no value beyond the amounts invested. It quotes from Dr. Burrows’ testimony at the
Hearing on Quantum that even when investing in real estate, “you would get back pretty
much what you spent.”?°® In Claimant’s view, this testimony is contradicted by
“millions” or real estate investors who expect to receive “a healthy return” on their
investment and “even less credible in the mining context where the business model itself—

as Pakistan’s own experts have acknowledged—is based on a risk-reward principle

whereby value increases exponentially as risk diminishes.”?°'”

1609. Claimant emphasizes that in any event the comparison of the project in 2006 with the
project in 2011 shows that it had “doubled the size of the deposit and transformed all of
the resource that had been determined in 2006 into reserves (but for the issurance of the
mining lease) through extensive additional drilling, testing, planning, and verification
work.” In Claimant’s view, this renders the assets “vastly different” and thus not eligible

for a “comparables” approach.°!!

1610.Claimant argues that the difference between resources and reserves is substantial and
refers to Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ assertion that reserves are worth five times as
much as measured and indicated resources and nearly eight times as much as inferred
resources. Emphasizing that it does not endorse these specific figures, Claimant agrees
with Respondent’s experts that “the technical and economic demonstration of a reserve
adds great value compared to unproven resources.””°'? Tt claims that while Antofagasta
and Barrick acquired a “risky and unproven exploration project’ in 2006, the capital-
intensive exploration program transformed the project from an “exploration gamble into
an actual mine,” allowing the team to “vastly improve the accuracy of the resource
estimate and to develop detailed plans to locate, extract, process, and finally transport
the copper and gold.”?°'?

1611.Specifically, Claimant argues that it: (i) increased the quantity of the drilling and the
quality of the information gained from the drilling by using more sophisticated
equipment; (ii) expanded the types of drilling to metallurgical drilling, condemnation
drilling, environmental drilling, hydrological drilling, engineering drilling, and
geotechnical drilling; (iii) used the so acquired information to create “a detailed blueprint
for the mine using known technologies and the largest readily available machinery in the
world” and to prepare detailed analyses of the required equipment as well as the feasibility
study for the slurry pipeline conducted by 2009; and (iv) engaged high-quality third-party
consultants and peer reviewers to “demonstrate the technical and economic viability of
the business opportunity” presented in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study.?0!+

1612.Claimant emphasizes that Dr. Burrows failed to make any adjustments for the value
created by Claimant after 2006. In addition, with regard to the expenditures made by
Claimant on the project during that time, Claimant rejects the argument that many of these

were not productive or inefficient or unrelated to the development of the project. It further
argues that in any event, even if certain expenditures were not efficient, this would not
justify ignoring their result of doubling the size of the resource and proving the feasibility
of mining 2.52 billion tonnes of ore. According to Claimant, a buyer would not care about
how much it spent but about the potential for future revenues that Claimant had

demonstrated at Reko Diq.?°!°

1613.Claimant further rejects Dr. Burrows’ argument that the expected metals production did
not increase between 2006 and 2011. Claimant submits that the 2006 spreadsheet on
which Dr. Burrows relied in support of the alleged comparability of the two assets was
not created by Antofagasta or its advisors but rather by an equity analyst at UBS who had
no involvement with or first-hand knowledge of the transaction. According to Claimant,
the spreadsheet therefore reflects no more than “that analyst’s own blue-sky projects
based on resource data disclosure by TCCA’s previous owner, Mincor.” Claimant also
rejects Dr. Burrows’ description of the spreadsheet as “detailed” projections and claims
that it is rather “crude back-of-the-envelope guesses about metallurgical recovery rates,
throughput, and production costs, information that no one—not Mincor, not Antofagasta,
not Barrick, and certaintly not UBS—knew in 2006.”7°'® In addition, Claimant
emphasizes that neither the 2006 press release nor the 2006 spreadsheet support Dr.
Burrows’ suggestion that Antofagasta in 2006 treated the deposit as though it were a
proven reserve ready to be mined or that Antofagasta “expected” with the degree of
certainty attached to a proven reserve that the metals production would be equal to the

resource estimate.?°!”

1614.As for the adjustments that Dr. Burrows has made, Claimant claims that these are
“meaningless, subjective, and erroneous.” Claimant submits that the mining indices on
which he relied to account for the change of prices and costs contains companies which
“vary widely in size, composition, and focus on exploration versus operating projects,
and even metals mined.” Claimant further considers that Dr. Burrows used a
“fundamentally incorrect” approach to account for the alleged change in country risk
because the sovereign yield spread includes a number of risks which do not impact the
value of a mine at Reko Dig. More generally, Claimant argues that the “massive size” of
the adjustments made confirms the incomparability of the project in 2006 to the project
in 2011.78

1615. Finally, Claimant contends that Dr. Burrows should have done a reasonableness check of
his valuation taking into account the broader market context, which would have
demonstrated that copper-gold deposits smaller than Reko Diq were valued at “tens of
billions of dollars” in 2011 by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Barrick. In
Claimant’s view, Dr. Burrows’ valuation therefore “cannot be squared with the actual

market realities on the Valuation Date.”*>!”

1616.Claimant further emphasizes that contrary to what Dr. Burrows was led to believe, Mr.
Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not make any attempt to perform a DCF valuation of the
project but only stated that the project either had no value, a negative value or the value
estimated by Dr. Burrows, without proving actual calculations or supporting evidence for
their assertions.?°?° As an example, Claimant refers to their opinion that the IRR is “far
below any reasonable hurdle rate for a mining firm investing in a mining project in
Balochistan” and notes that Respondent’s experts did not specify what they considered
to be a “reasonable hurdle rate” but only suggest that such a rate would be above 30%,
without offering any evidentiary support and only based on “hearsay statements
purportedly made—during negotiations---by a gold developer in a project Prof. Wells is
advising on in an undisclosed country” which may well have related to the cost of equity
and not the cost of capital.?°?! Claimant relies on Prof. Davis’ explanation that “[nJo large
project anywhere in the world would survive a discount rate of 30% given that it can take
almost a decade from first cash spent to first revenue spent.” Claimant also notes that its
owners continued to invest millions of dollars in the Reko Diq project despite its projected

IRR below 30% in the Scoping Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.?°”?

1617. According to Claimant, “the discount rates investors were actually using to value and
make investment decisions about mining projects in Balochistan were consistent with the
10% discount rate TCCA used in the Expansion Study model.”?°”* It specifically refers to
MCC which owns the Duddar mine in Balochistan and used a 12.55% pre-tax nominal
discount rate in 2012, almost equivalent to the 12.86% nominal discount rate used in the
Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study (equivalent to a 10% real discount rate).7°>4

1618.Claimant further contends that the IRR reported in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study
is “not a particularly useful indicator of the value of the Project” given that, as pointed
out by Mr. Pingle, it is “by definition, a conservative analytical tool” which was “the
result of conservative assumptions” and did not reflect the actual rate of return expected
for the project.?°?> In Claimant’s view, this is consistent with Mr. Luksic’s testimony that
feasibility models are not intended to determine a mine’s value but to confirm that “the
project is robust enough to provide a reasonable rate of return even in the unfavorable
circumstances.” Claimant adds that the IRRs and NPVs are evaluations rather than
valuations as they are intended to test the project and determine that it can break even but

not to calculate how profitable it can be.?°?6

1619. Claimant refers to Mr. Septilveda who explained that the purpose of creating the financial
model “was not to determine a sales price for the project’ but rather “to create a tool that
would give TCCA and its owners a sense of the elements that drove project value, and
how key assumptions affected that value, to help them evaluate and make decisions about
the project.” He also testified that “no one involved in the project believed that this
reflected the project’s fair market value” and that he “would have been astonished if
Antofagasta and Barrick had agreed to sell their interest in the project at any valuation
even close to that low, especially not in November 2011 when metals prices were even

higher."

1620.Claimant also refers to Prof. Davis’ explanation that “[i]t is well-accepted in mine
valuation that technical studies like feasibility and pre-feasibility studies do not attempt
a project valuation. They attempt an economic analysis of the technical and financial
merits of a project.” Quoting from the International Mineral Valuation Committee IMVal,
Prof. Davis explained that standards organizations distinguish between valuation, which
“addresses the estimation of a value of a Mineral Property,” and evaluation, which

“addresses the broader ass 792028

 

ssment of a Mineral Property for an investment decision.

1621.In addition, Claimant refers to Mr. Luksic who explained that “[t]he primary reason why
the NPV of our Feasibility Study does not properly reflect the project’s value is that it is
calculated using very conservative assumptions that are kept static for the entire life of
the mine.” According to Claimant, these conservative assumptions are reflected in: (i)
the price assumptions of the model, which were considerably lower than spot prices as of
June 2010 as well as in the fact that model valued only reserves; (ii) did not include any
value for 2.7 billion ore tonnes of inferred resources and mineral inventories at Reko Diq,

which “[i]n actual sale, ... would have added considerable value’; (iii) gave no value to
substantial potential cost savings that Claimant had identified as “CAPEX reduction
opportunities” and “value engineering” opportunities; and (iv) did not take into account
the value associated with flexible management that could respond to changing market
conditions, which Mr. Luksic described as an “immensely valuable” feature that “would
have been front and center in any negotiation for a price for the project in the event of a

sale.?2030

1622.Claimant notes that “[d]espite all of this deliberate conservatism,” the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study confirmed the robustness of the project, yielding a net present value of
USD 1.206 billion at a 10% discount rate. It adds that Prof. Davis’ update of the
calculation to the valuation date, using average price projections made by other mining
companies that were significantly below the spot prices and Barrick’s updated capital and
operating cost estimates, yielded a net present value of USD 4.0 billion with a “highly
attractive 18.5% return on investment, even under the extremely conservative price
projections in that updated model”; Claimant’s 75% share of that NPV would have been
USD 3.0 billion.2°! Claimant emphasizes that Respondent’s experts fail to account for
the fact that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was finalized more than 16 months
before the valuation date, i.e., in June 2010, even though gold prices rose considerably
during that time, rendering the price projects in the model much lower than the future
price projections as of the valuation date. In Claimant’s view, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof.
Wells also incorrectly rely on the NPV calculated at using a 12% discount rate even
though it is clearly stated in the Study that “a 10% discount rate has been selected as the

‘base case’ discount rate for the EXP study.”?°*

1623.Claimant maintains that the updated calculation of Prof. Davis does not provide an
accurate value estimate because it does not attribute any value to management flexibility
or inferred resources and is “conservative in other ways,” particularly in its price

assumptions, but argues that the calculation serves to contradict Mr. Brailovsky’s and

Prof. Wells’ claim that the project had no value.”

1624. Finally, Claimant argues that while Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells criticized Prof. Davis

for applying a “very low Discount Rate,” they did not provide any meaningful guidance

to the Tribunal as to the appropriate treatment of risk given that they did not actually

calculate a discount rate that they would consider appropriate for the project as of the
valuation date.?°* Claimant also emphasizes that contrary to Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof.
Well’s suggestion, Dr. Burrows also did not calculate a 23% discount rate but explicitly
stated that his computation “is not an estimate of the cost of capital as of November 2011.”
In Claimant’s view, he mashed together a purported “2006 cost of capital excl. country
risk” with the sovereign yield spread in 2011 which double-counted risks and further
included several risks that the Reko Diq project would not have faced.?°*>

Summary of Respondent’s Position

1625.Respondent submits that the only proper determination of the fair market value of

Claimant’s interest in Reko Diq has been provided by Dr. Burrows who, “following best
practices and his long forensic experience, ... identified the existence of a prior
transaction that, with some adjustments, would be the best approximation to that fair

market value.”?°°

1626. Respondent emphasizes that while Prof. Davis examined eight properties in his report and

concluded that they were not comparable to Reko Diq, he neglected to consider an
“undoubtedly comparable” arm’s length transaction, i.e., the acquisition by Barrick of
50% in Claimant in September 2006 for a value of USD 246 million. Respondent submits
that it agrees with the requirements listed by Prof. Davis to establish comparability,
“Telxcept for some details,” but maintains that the past transaction involving Reko Diq
meets those requirements and is thus “extremely useful for the establishment of this

valuation.”?°>7

1627.Respondent rejects the argument that the project in 2006 was not comparable to the

project in 2011 or that Dr. Burrows should have looked for other comparable transactions
and refers to Dr. Burrows’ explanation that “[i]f there is a prior transaction in the
property that is usable as a reference point, there is no need to search for comparable
transactions. No transaction in any other property can be more representative of value
than a transaction in the property itself.’ As Dr. Burrows explained, “[mlost of the factors
that vary across mineral properties do not vary significantly for Reko Dig itself between

the two dates.”?08

1628. Respondent emphasizes that this valuation exercise was performed “for ease of reference
and to provide a valid answer in case the Tribunal was in fact—quod non—in the position
to identify the fair market value of TCC’s interest in Reko Dig even when TCC failed to
satisfy the burden of proof regarding the damages it seeks.” It clarifies that “the valuation
submitted by Pakistan through the independent expert Dr. Burrows intends to challenge,
and not to cure, the procedural and scientific defects of TCC’s case on quantum, which

under applicable law should be dismissed by the Tribunal.”?°*°

1629.Respondent refers to Dr. Burrows’ explanation that the fair market value would be
determined in the most accurate manner by referring to the set of transactions by which
Antofagasta and Barrick acquired Claimant in 2006, subject to a number of adjustments
described by Dr. Burrows in his first report. Respondent claims that, by contrast, “[n]one
of the remaining approaches or remedies proposed by TCC would have been taken into
account by the hyptohetical seller and buyer in finding a fair market value at which to
transact over the asset,” including Claimant’s “abandoned attempt at obtaining
restitution or sunk costs” or an “uninformed, exaggerated guess on the size of the mineral

deposits actually available for mining.”?°”

1630.Respondent contends that the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows to the 2006 transactions
to account for changes that occurred in the intervening period were “conservative and
adequate.” It rejects the argument that Dr. Burrows failed to account for changes in
the reported resources of the property, operating costs and mining technology between
2006 and 2011. In Respondent’s view, “[n]one of the criticisms attempted are technically
viable or procedurally relevant.” It argues that Antofagasta and Barrick claim to be
among the top mining companies in the world who would have performed due diligence
on the property. According to Respondent, “[i]t is therefore almost certainly the case that
when the parties entered into the acquisition in 2006 they all had a good understanding
of the total resource base of TCC.”??

1631.Respondent refers to Dr. Burrows’ explanation that additional development work carried
out between 2006 and 2011 resulted in negative surprises as the projections made in 2006
of the total copper and gold recovery over the life of the mine “were very close, but higher,
than the projections in the 2011 feasibility study” whereas the projections of costs “all
increased significantly.” Respondent also submits that “[t]he 2006 mine plan projected
production of 52,000 million metric tons per year over 45 years, in comparison to 40,000

million metric tons per year in the base case and 40 million metric tons per year rising

to 80,000 tons per year over 35 years in the expansion case.”?°

1632. According to Respondent, the comparison demonstrates that “the parties had an accurate

understanding of the total mineralization of the Reko Dig project’ but that “additional
development after 2006 needed to design the mine led to negative surprises about
recovery costs.” Respondent argues that there was therefore no need for an adjustment in
Dr. Burrows’ calculation to account for an increased size of the deposit or economies of

scale.204

1633.Respondent further rejects the argument that Dr. Burrows should have made an

adjustment to account for increased geologic certainty or a more advanced stage of the
project. According to Respondent, Dr. Burrows demonstrated that “a mine increases in
value over time as expenditures are made on exploration, drilling, feasibility studies and
mine plans (i.e., as sunk costs at the time of valuation increase and remaining
development costs decline) and as expected production increase or costs decline as a
result of additional discoveries over time.” Respondent considers that Dr. Burrows was

conservative in not making downward adjustments to account for these changes.?°>

1634.In addition, Respondent notes that Dr. Burrows did make an upward adjustment in value

2043,

accounting for the reduction in time to construction between 2006 and 2011 which even
overstates the value of Reko Dig. As for Claimant’s exploration expenditures,
Respondent refers to Dr. Burrows’ explanation that Antofagasta had made a projection of
efficient expenditures in the amount of USD 75 million in 2006 and that of the USD 219
million that Claimant claims to have spent, “an unknown amount was spent on Reko Diq”
and “[m]uch of this expenditure was wasted or redundant” so that Dr. Burrows could not
attribute any further value to these expenditures.”°*° Respondent further quotes:
“Efficient and appropriate expenditure on Reko Dig, higher metals prices,
and time advancement of the project would have increased its value. The
increase in capital and operating costs and in country risk would have
decreased its value. I adjust for the factors which increase the value but not
for the changes which would have decreased the value. I conclude that the
maximum value of Reko Dig on the Valuation Date was about $149.2 million
(assuming that all of the projected $75 million in Exploration and
Development expenditures projected in 2006 were efficiently and non-

redundantly made and that a hypothetical buyer would not expect to have to
re-do any of these expenditures).”?°""

1635. Respondent considers that the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows are based on “solid, non-
speculative and a conservative evaluation of the available evidence” and notes that Dr.
Burrows did not implement reductions to account for the fact that the 2006 transactions
involved more assets than Claimant’s interest in Reko Digq or for litigation risks and tax
increases or any of the technical shortcomings that Respondent claims to have identified,
which would have decreased the value below the amount calculated by Dr. Burrows.
Respondent emphasizes that the 2006 purchase price was primarily: (i) increased to

reflect the rise in mineral prices between 2006 and 2011 and efficient expenditures; and

   

(ii) decreased to account for “the very significant increase in the perception of country
risk for Pakistan in general and Balochistan in particular.”?°* Respondent rejects the
argument that the adjustments are “large” and “subjective,” arguing that the
characterization as “large” is in itself a “subjective” evaluation and that the adjustments

were instead based on “objective, appropriate, and transparent data”?

1636.Specifically, Respondent submits that Dr. Burrows adjusted for: (i) changes in
expectations about metals prices; (ii) inflation of production costs in the global mining
industry; (iii) changes in the general cost of capital for metals mines; and (iv) changes in
country risk for Pakistan. Based on the share price indices for copper mines and gold
mines, Dr. Burrows first increased the transaction value by the weighted average of 104%
to account for changes in prices and costs; based on the increase of the sovereign yield
spread in Pakistan, Dr. Burrows then decreased the value to account for the change in

country risk.7°°°

1637.Respondent submits that the results of these adjustments is a fair market value not
exceeding USD 149.2 million as of the valuation date, which results from the “simple
exercise” illustrated by Dr. Burrows at the Hearing on Quantum as follows:?°>!

1638. According to Respondent, this valuation shows that Claimant has “artificially inflated its
claim by billions of dollars, or over 98.2% of the value claimed of USD 8.5 billion.”?°>

1639. Respondent further argues that the value projected by Prof. Davis at USD 8.5 billion is
also contradicted by the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, claiming that
“[bloth reports presented very similar analyses of most of the variables, although with
totally different results.” According to Respondent, the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study

“assigns no positive value if any realistic discount rate is used.”

1640. Respondent considers that the statements made by Claimant on the one hand and Prof.
Davis on the other hand regarding the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study contradict each
other. In Respondent’s view, Claimant “praised whole-heartedly the work carried out by
SNC-Lavalin of the Reko Dig project” which would lead one to conclude “that the SNC-
Lavalin studies provide exactly the basis the Claimant would use to value the project and
determine its claim.” Respondent emphasizes that each of the components used in Prof.
Davis’ model, except for the government equity take, is also included in the Expansion
Pre-Feasibility Study which even contained a “risk register.” It further notes that of the
several price scenarios for copper and gold contained in the Study, the 20% below the
central price scenario “seems to approximate very closely the NPVs of Brattle, at a range
of discount rates going from zero to 30%,” i.e., the entire range of discount rates. In
Respondent’s view, this contradicts Prof. Davis’ statement that the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study is a “‘stale technical study [the results of which do not allow one] to infer

anything about the economic merits of the project on the Valuation Date.”?°**

1641. With regard to Prof. Davis’ update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study, Respondent contends that the Hearing on Quantum revealed “myriad, unresolved
and fatal errors in the determination of the project’s costs.” Respondent points out that

the revised calculation introduced by Claimant during the Hearing “admitted that their
calculations of expenditures had to be increased by approximately a missing USD 1
billion.”?°°

1642.In Respondent’s view, these admitted errors as well as the “very significant omissions, as

3.

yet unquantified” it clams to have identified, “make any attempt at actually assessing the
net cash flows of the Reko Dig project described in the IMD FS and the EXP PFS an
exercise in fantasy.” As an example, Respondent refers to Prof. Davis’ assumption of all
equity financing as opposed to the assumption in the Feasibility Study that 40% of the
initial capital costs, i.e., USD 1.5 billion, would be financed, as a result of which “net
cash flows did not account for the amortization of interest of that financing.” Respondent
therefore maintains that “the valuation put forward by TCC fails to reflect the fair market

value of its participation in Reko Dig.”°**

Tribunal’s Analysis

1643. As noted in the context of the Tribunal’s assessment of the appropriate valuation method

for Claimant’s investment in the present circumstances, neither Party has presented a
valuation based on a traditional DCF analysis conducted for the purposes of this
arbitration with inputs as of the valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells placed
much emphasis in their expert reports on the “conventional DCF calculations of the SNC-
Lavalin analyses,”?®>’ i.e., the calculations in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study, which were both completed in 2010. They did not, however, update
these analyses to the valuation date. In particular, they did not update the prices for gold
and copper, which dated from March 2010 in both Studies, to reflect price developments
and contemporaneous expectations as of November 2011. The only reliable indication of
the result that a traditional DCF analysis might have produced if it had been performed is
Prof. Davis’ update of the calculation included in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.

1644. In addition, the Tribunal has been provided with a valuation performed by Respondent’s

expert Dr. Burrows, which is based on the past transactions by which Antofagasta and
Barrick acquired Claimant in 2006.

1645.The Tribunal will address both calculations in turn and assess whether there are

reasonable grounds for any remaining deviations between the conclusion reached by the
Tribunal above and the results yielded by those calculations.

a. Verification of the Tribunal’s Conclusion Taking Into Account the Updated
DCF Calculation from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study

1646.As for the update of the calculation from the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, the
Tribunal is aware that it was not presented by Prof. Davis as an alternative to his valuation
based on the modern DCF method but rather to show why, in his opinion, the comparison
drawn by Respondent’s experts to his valuation based on the 2010 calculation in the
Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was an “apples and oranges” comparison.2"* As noted
above, a traditional DCF calculation conducted for this arbitration might have produced
a result different from the (updated) calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study,
which was performed for a different purpose and did not aim at calculating the fair market
value of the project. Mr. Septilveda, who was involved in assembling the financial model
for the Feasibility Study in 2010, explained the purpose of the financial model as follows:
“The purpose of the model was to create a tool that would give TCC and its
owners a sense of the elements that drove project value, and how key
assumptions affected that value, to help them evaluate and make decisions
about the project. The tool’s uses included, among other things, assessing
whether the project was economically feasible, the relative importance of
various items that TCC was negotiating with the governments of Pakistan and
Balochistan, and the value to Balochistan of different ownership
structures,”?0°°
1647. Mr. Septilveda added that “our purpose in creating the model was not to determine a sale
price for the project” and testified that “no one involved in the project believed that [the
base case NPV of the Reko Diq IMD amounting to USD 656 million] reflected the
project’s fair market value.”?° Apart from the fact the at the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study already indicated a base case NPV of USD 1,209 million,?°°! Mr. Septilveda
considered that “[i]n a sale process neither the seller nor the buyer would just take the
Feasibility Study or Pre-feasibility Study evaluation figure as the price. Instead, each of
them would consider what they thought it was worth to them. To do so the seller would
provide the underlying geological and technical data, and the buyer would make its own
determination of value using whatever model, assumptions and approaches it
favored.” In addition, Mr. Septilveda considered it likely that a seller would “update
metals prices, costs and even the pit design and resource estimate (which can change

with changing economics),” “assess realistic expansions” and “consider charging for the

inferred resource as well as the proven resource because we already have strong

indications that there is a lot more metal to be mined than TCC provided in the Feasibility
Study.” He also referred to the issue of “how to put an appropriate value on Reko Diq’s
enormous, world-class size,” noting that “[a]t a 10% discount rate a conventional NPV
analysis gives almost no value for revenues from 15 years and later” and arguing that
“Tt]he true value of Reko Dig lies in the fact that it promised to produce in times of both

low and high prices for decades to come.”?°%

1648. Mr. Luksic also testified in his second witness statement that “[t]he economic model in a
feasibility study is merely intended to help the sponsors and potential financiers confirm
that the project is economic and that there are sufficient cash flows to pay back the initial
capital investment. While the Net Present Value (‘NPV’) can help guide the sponsor’s
investment decisions, it is not the only indicator of value.” In support of his view that the
NPV in the Feasibility Study “does not properly reflect the project’s value,” Mr. Luksic
referred to what he considered to be “very conservative assumptions that are kept static
for the entire life of the mine.” He explained that “[t]o stress test the project, you plug in
conservative prices and a high discount rate into your financial model.”?°* Mr. Luksic
further referred to the “immensely valuable” flexibility of a long-life mine that would
have helped them to manage the volatility of commodity prices. He testified that “[t]he
size of the Reko Dig deposi d the } ial for multiple ex} i t that we

 

would be able to exploit the highs and protect against the lows. This feature of the Reko
Dig project is one that would have been front and center in any negotiation for a price
for the project in the event of a sale but is completely absent from a model using static

prices.”2055

1649. As addressed in detail above, Respondent’s experts relied on a comparison of the cash
flows yielded by Prof. Davis’ modern DCF model with the (non-updated) calculation in
the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study in both of their expert reports. However, Mr.
Brailovsky also confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that “as you say, valuation is
different from evaluation,” referring specifically to the differences in making price
assumptions as “a feasibility study won’t say which price” but will have a “menu of prices,

just like this one.”

1650. As pointed out by Prof. Davis, the distinction between valuation and evaluation is also
confirmed by CIMVal in its Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral
Properties, which clarify that “Valuation in the CIMVal Standards and Guidelines is
concerned with the value or worth of a Mineral Property as opposed to ‘evaluation’

where the key objective is an economic assessment or determination of the economic merit
of a property.” Similarly, the International Mineral Property Valuation Standards
Committee IMVal stated in its Standards Template that “[t]ze Template deals with
Valuation, which is distinct from Evaluation. The distinction inherent in these defined
terms is that Valuation addresses the estimation of value of a Mineral Property, whereas
Evaluation addresses the broader assessment of a Mineral Property for an investment

decision.”?°°8

1651.Taking into account the explanations above, the Tribunal will bear in mind the differences
between a calculation aimed at determining the fair market value of the project and the
calculations perfomed in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.
However, recalling that it has not been provided with a traditional DCF calculation by
either Party, or any other income-based calculation for that matter, the Tribunal considers
it appropriate to take into account the indication of value reflected in the calculations as
updated by Prof. Davis and to verify that it is reconcilable with the Tribunal’s conclusion
on the value of Claimant’s investment.

1652. Prof. Davis explained in his second report that he took the following approach to updating
the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study:

“... LT updated the EXP PFS NPV calculation using metal prices consistent
with technical reports published close to the Valuation Date. The average
prices used across these technical reports published on SEDAR, the website
of the Canadian Securities Administrators, were $3.12/lb for copper and
$1,266/oz for gold, substantially higher than the $2.20/b and $925/oz
respectively assumed by the EXP PFS. I also updated the cost assumptions
using the updated costs provided by Barrick and used in my own valuation.

Using prices and costs updated to reflect conditions at the Valuation Date,
the EXP PFS calculation yields a NPV of $4.03 billion for the Project and

$3.02 billion for TCC’s 75% share. The implied real IRR of the cash flows
projections is 18.5%.”

1653. Noting that these numbers were “substantially higher than those calculated in the EXP
PFS, and to which Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Wells refer,” Prof. Davis considered that
this highlighted “the problem with using stale technical study results to infer anything
about the economic merits of the project on the Valuation Date.” Specifically, he argued
that the application of a 15% discount rate to the technical study “would produce a
positive NPV, not a negative NPV” and thus, according to the logic presented by

2067 Exhibit CE-919, p. 5.
2068 Exhibit CE-1526, p. 6. See also Davis Il, {4 95-96.

Respondent’s experts, confirm that the project had a positive value as of the valuation
date.207

1654.Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells addressed the updated calculation presented by Prof.
Davis only in a footnote of their second report, arguing as follows:

“Brattle in its Second Report ({ 302), ran the SNC-Lavalin model with certain
prices and other adjustments to show that the IRR of the project at those
prices is more than 18% and therefore would have a positive NPV even
assuming a discount rate of 15%. (In CE-1556, which contains the
spreadsheet of the version used by Brattle of the SNC-Lavalin model, the rate
of return after government equity stake is only 17.2%, not 18%. Similarly,
Brattle says that the NPV of the project for TCC is US$3.3 billion at 15%. It
is not. This is the NPV obtained at a discount rate of 10%. At 15%, the NPV
is, instead, US$620 million.) Of course, the higher the prices, the higher the
IRR. Thus, for example, for this exercise Brattle used a flat real price for
copper of US$3.12/ton, whereas for its own model the average real price was
US$1.43/ton—less than half—and US$2.2 in the SNC-Lavalin base scenario.
In contrast, the price for gold used by Brattle in this exercise was lower than
that contemplated in the Brattle model (US$1.265/ton vs. US$1,829/ton),
which is not surprising given the untenable high values used by the Brattle
reports, as we have indicated since our First Report. However, introducing
both real average prices found in the Brattle Report to the same version of
the SNC-Lavalin model presented by Brattle itself in CE-1556, the rate of
return falls to 6.6% and the NPV at a 15% discount rate is -US$1.978 billion,
a large negative figure."

1655. As a preliminary point, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to what Mr. Brailovsky and Prof.
Wells suggest in their footnote, Prof. Davis did not state that the net present value of
Claimant’s stake in the project would amount to USD 3.3 billion when using a discount
rate of 15%. He rather stated that the application of a 15% discount rate would produce a
positive NPV, without identifying this amount or specifying the discount rate by whose
application he reached the conclusion that the calculation yielded a net present value of
USD 3.02 billion. However, it can be deduced from the excel spreadsheet underlying
Prof. Davis’ calculation and was also confirmed by Prof. Davis at the Hearing on
Quantum that the value of USD 4.03 billion for the project as a whole (i.e., including the
GOB’s 25% stake) was calculated based on a 10% discount rate.”

1656. More specifically, Prof. Davis’ updated calculation yielded the following after-tax net
present values of the project (including the GOB’s 25% stake), depending on the discount
rate to be applied:

1658.In addition to their criticism regarding the use of a 10% discount rate, Respondent’s

experts also criticized the price assumptions made by Prof. Davis in his update and noted
that when introducing “real average prices found in the Brattle report to the same version
of the SNC-Lavalin model presented by Brattle itself,” the net present value at a 15%
discount rate would be decreased to a negative USD -1.978 billion. Mr. Brailovsky and
Prof. Wells did not provide any further explanation or support for this statement in their
report; in particular, they did not substantiate their calculation or the prices on the basis
of which they reached the aforementioned conclusion.

1659. Prof. Davis, on the other hand, identified in his second expert report a total of 33 technical

reports dating from between November 2011 and Jaunary 2012 and the prices for gold
and/or copper on which these reports had based their financial calculations. Specifically,
Prof. Davis presented 25 gold prices and 11 copper prices as well as, inter alia, the
average prices resulting from these technical reports, i.e., USD 1,266/oz for gold and USD
3.12/Ib for copper.?°”? All 33 technical reports were submitted into the record.”°”* On that
basis, he used in his update a constant price of USD 1,260/oz for gold and USD 3,10/Ib

for copper.?°7>

1660. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not dispute in their second report that the technical

reports on which Prof. Davis relied had used the prices presented in his Workpaper for
the purposes of their financial calculations. At the Hearing on Quantum Mr. Brailovsky
testified that Prof. Davis’ update of the calculation was wrong “[b]ecause he took the
peak prices prevailing at that time and kept them constant.” When asked whether he was
aware that Prof. Davis had taken prices from published feasibility studies available
around the time of the valuation date which were lower than the spot price as of the
valuation date, Mr. Brailovsky stated that “J don’t have to look into what other feasibility
studies were” and reiterated his understanding that Prof. Davis “was taking the prices

prevailing at that point.” Mr. Brailovsky added that “as you say, valuation is different
from evaluation, so a feasibility study won't say which price. It will have a menu of prices,

just like this one.” He confirmed that he was not aware which of these prices Prof. Davis

had taken for his update of the calculation.2°”°

1661.Mr. Brailovsky further testified that Prof. Davis’ updated calculation could not be taken
seriously when considering that it yielded cash flows that were about 50% higher than the
cash flows calculated by Prof. Davis based on his modern DCF model (USD 96,299
billion in gross revenues as opposed to USD 64,953 billion) and when considering that
“the Consensus Economics, which represents the opinion of all the major financial
institutions in the world, will produce something lower than the 64 billion” yielded by
Prof. Davis’ moden DCF model. In his opinion, the updated calculation was “completely
irrelevant. It’s a travesty.”?°" Mr. Brailovsky reiterated that he could not accept the
updated calculation because the methods on which he had relied to make price
projections, i.e., the Consensus Economics forecast and the Ornstein-Ohlenbeck process,

“will produce less than 64.9, less, not more.”?078

1662. As a preliminary point, the Tribunal cannot agree with Mr. Brailovsky that the fact that
the undiscounted gross revenues in the updated calculation were considerably higher than
the risk-adjusted cash flows calculated by Prof. Davis would render this update unreliable.
In the Tribunal’s view, this divergence rather supports Prof. Davis’ argument that the cash
flows in his modern valuation already included considerable risk adjustments. Mr.
Brailovsky’s oral testimony also clarified, however, that he considered the prices assumed
by Prof. Davis for the purposes of updating the calculation in the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study inappropriate and, in particular, inconsistent with the price forecasts of
Consensus Economics on which Respondent’s experts relied in their expert reports. While
Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not identify what they described as the “real average
prices” in their second report, Mr. Brailovsky’s testimony indicates that they may have
been referring to the Consensus Economics forecast and that using these prices in the
updated calculation of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, the net present value of the
cash flows would have turned negative at a discount rate of 15%.

1663. However, Mr. Brailovsky explicitly agreed that the calculation made in the Expansion
Pre-Feasibility Study was not made for the purposes of determining the value of the
project and therefore did not use a projection of a certain price development in the future
but rather a “menu of prices,” i.e., a static price and various sensitivity analyses. In
addition and while Mr. Brailovsky considered that he did not have to look into the prices
assumed by other feasibilities studies published at the time, he did not dispute that these

studies had used the prices recorded in Prof. Davis’ Workpaper or that the prices Prof.
Davis had used in his update reflected the average of these price assumptions. Given the
undisputed different purpose for which calculations in technical feasibility studies are
made, the Tribunal agrees with Prof. Davis that the best indication of the prices that would
have been used in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study if the
financial analysis included therein had been prepared as of the valuation date can be found
in the prices used in other feasibility studies published around the valuation date. While
the Tribunal has found above that a buyer would likely not have ignored the much lower
Consensus Economics forecast in the context of a valuation aimed at determining the fair
market value of the project, it is not convinced that this forecast would have been a better
indicator of the prices that would have been used in the calculation of a technical
feasibility study at the time than the prices actually used in other feasibility studies. On
balance, the Tribunal therefore cannot accept Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Wells’ criticism
of the price assumptions used in Prof. Davis’ update of the calculation in the Expansion
Pre-Feasibility Study.

1664. In the Tribunal’s view, the above also shows, however, that the relevance of a calculation
in a technical study to the question before this Tribunal, i.e., the determination of the fair
market value of Claimant’s investment in the project, is limited. In particular, given the
significant impact that the price assumptions for gold and copper have on the overall
result of the calculation, the Tribunal considers that a calculation using a static price over
the entire life of the mine cannot be considered a sufficiently reliable indicator of the fair
market value to be determined on the basis of the entirety of the cash flows, part of which
will be generated only several decades into the future. It rather confirms that the focus of
the calculation in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was on
confirming the economic feasibility of the project and determining the length of the
payback period, i.e., the time it would take to recover capital costs, which was determined
to be 7.1 years in the initial mine development scenario and 7.9 years in the expansion

scenario.2°”?

1665. Having said that, it appears to the Tribunal that, in any event, the indication of value
reflected in the updated calculation made by Prof. Davis does not contradict the
conclusion reached by the Tribunal based on the modern DCF valuation model.

1666. The Tribunal notes that an issue arose at the Hearing on Quantum because Prof. Davis
corrected the statement he had made in paragraph 302 of his second report with regard to
the value yielded by the updated calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.
Specifically, he stated that he had “adjusted upward slightly” the value and implied real
IRR of the cash flow projections, which were now as follows:

2079 Cf, Septilveda, || 16; Exhibit CE-243, Table 1.3.

“Using prices and costs updated to reflect conditions at the Valuation Date,
the EXP PFS calculation yields a NPV of $4.24 billion for the Project and
$3.18 billion for TCC’s 75% share. The implied real IRR of the cash flow
projections is 18.9%,”

1667. He further explained the reason for his correction:

“So, the exercise here, as you know, the EXP study was completed in 2010
using 2009 costs. And, in my analysis, to build a cash flow model that Ineeded
for my modern approach, I used an update of those costs as measured by
Barrick to 2011. So, Barrick provided me with an update of the technical
study costs to 2011.

In generating this update to respond to the idea that my cash flows are the
same as the EXP cash flows, I felt it important to treat them on an apples to
apples basis. So, in paragraph 302, I updated the EXP cash flows, whose
costs were 2009 to 2011.

To be consistent, I should have used the escalations that Barrick did, but I did
not. I used escalations from another source called Wood Mackenzie. Now, I
do use Wood Mackenzie escalations going forward in my spreadsheet, but I
did not use them to bring, in my own analysis, to bring the technical studies’
costs up to 2011 costs. So, I had an inconsistent set of escalators in there.
For one point of my Report I used the Barrick adjustments, and specifically
to address this comment, I erroneously used Wood Mackenzie adjustments.
And since they were not completely identical, it results in slightly different
cash flows, NPV results, and IRRs for an updated 2011 EXP, and that was
the correction that I wished to insert into my Report.”?°*!

1668. In response to the correction presented by Prof. Davis which was provided to Respondent
two days before Prof. Davis gave oral testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, Respondent
sought to introduce certain additional documents into the record. Claimant objected to the
introduction of these documents and disputed in particular Respondent’s submission that
these documents were directly responsive to or triggered by the correction presented by
Prof. Davis. This applied, in particular, to an analysis of “implied prices” that Respondent
sought to introduce into the record. While Respondent acknowledged that Prof. Davis’
correction did not include any change to the copper and gold prices he had used in the

updated calculation,?>*?

it argued that the changes had an effect on the “implied prices”
for both metals, i.e., “[t]he price of the minerals times the cost you would have to incur
to actually extract them,” and “a very significant impact on the Valuation discussion’, it

therefore maintained that “the changes introduced actually effect the prices of the

minerals, of course, not the Base Prices, but the Implied Prices that are what is relevant
for purposes of valuation.”*°*? Claimant disputed the relevance of the calculation of
implied prices, which in its view was only “comparing gross revenues to copper
payable,” and emphasized that this was a “wholly new analysis” which had not been
presented by Respondent’s experts in their second report but for the first time in response
to the correction made by Prof. Davis to his updated calculation.°** According to
Claimant, this analysis “ha[d] absolutely nothing to do with the correction” made by Prof.
Davis but was rather based on “old data that hasn’t changed.”?°*>

1669. Respondent emphasized that Prof. Davis’ update of the costs in the calculation indicated
that the initial costs “were off by over USD 1 billion” and maintained that it “would not
have needed to make this new calculation of what the impact on the impact [sic] price of
copper and gold were it not for the moving targets of what the calculations on the costs
were” based on the corrections introduced by Prof. Davis.”°*° Respondent confirmed that
the analysis it was seeking to introduce was “not based on any piece of information that
was not prior to this date already in the record of the case,” i.e., including the correction
provided by Prof. Davis shortly before his oral testimony, but rather “at best, new

calculations based on the data as submitted by Claimants yesterday.”?°*’

1670.The analysis of “implied prices,” in particular, the timeliness of its introduction and
whether it was triggered by the correction made by Prof. Davis or rather a stand-alone
analysis that should have been made in Mr. Brailovsky’s and Prof. Well’s second report,
was extensively discussed between counsel before the cross-examination of Prof.
Davis.”°** Having heard both sides, the Tribunal decided that the spreadsheet containing
the analysis of “implied prices” could be used during the cross-examination of Prof.
Davis, subject to the Tribunal’s final decision on whether it would admit the document
into the record once it had more clarity as to what was a response to Prof. Davis’

correction and what was not.?08

1671.The Tribunal further notes that following this discussion, Claimant proposed that as they
did not believe the changes to be material or to “really materially affect any number that

[the Tribunal] will be concerned about in the case,” it would be content to rely on the

uncorrected numbers for the case. Respondent rejected this proposal, however, arguing
that “[w]e have before us a case that is premised on the notion that the Valuation could

And we have the Expert--Mr. Davis has found that months after the First Report--actually
over a year after his First Report, his calculation on the Opex and Capex was off by over
USDI billion. So, I don't think that assuming that error had not been found is in any way
useful, and I think that the fact that the error was found is very instrumental to the

discussion that we still have to hold before the Tribunal.”?°°

1672. The analysis of implied prices was not raised by Respondent during the cross-examination
of Prof. Davis. Nor was it addressed in the presentation or examination of Respondent’s
experts or the expert conferencing held following their oral testimony. During Prof.
Davis’ cross-examination, his update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility
Study was referred to only in the following discussion:

“TY]our valuation of the Project based on the information primarily taken
from the Feasibility Study yields a Net Present Value that is between 15 and

20 times higher than that calculated in the Feasibility Study itself; is that
correct?

A. No. If you update the Feasibility Study to the Valuation Date in an apples
to apples comparison, believe the number--and this gets into our errata--I
would be happy with the 4 billion number for 100 percent, or 3 billion for 75
percent. That's the number from the updated Feasibility Study.

Or if we go with the corrected values--I'm not sure what is in the record now.
It is 4.24 billion or 3.18 billion is really irrelevant for the purposes I'm going
to speak to now. That number, if one wishes to just compare it to my number
of 8.5, I think the multiple is more like 2.5.

Q. What Discount Rate for the Feasibility Study?

A. Feasibility Study, which is a study that was intended to evaluate the
progress of the Project as opposed to value--and I made this clear in my
Report too--the Project, the Feasibility Study used 10 percent real as a Base
Case Discount Rate.”?”!

1673.In the absence of any further discussion or testimony on the analysis of “implied prices,”
the Tribunal does not see any basis to assume that Prof. Davis’ correction had an impact
on the price assumptions he used in his update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study. Nor does the Tribunal see any basis to revisit the conclusion it has
reached above regarding Prof. Davis’ approach to base his price assumptions for the
update on the average of the prices used in other feasibility studies published around the
time of the valuation date.

1674. Respondent further argued that by correcting his initial calculation, Prof. Davis admitted
that his calculation had been “off by over a billion dollars” and considered it accepted
that the project had not been de-risked as assumed in Prof. Davis’ valuation based on

certainty-equivalent cash flows.?°°

However, as pointed out by Claimant and Prof. Davis,
the correction concerned only his update of the calculation in the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study and not his modern DCF valuation model. This calculation, however, is

not based on the concept of “de-risked” or “certainty-equivalent” cash flows.

1675.In addition, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent’s argument that Prof. Davis’
correction would raise more general doubts as to the reliability of his valuation. Prof.
Davis explained that he corrected the costs in his updated calculation because he realized
in preparing for the Hearing on Quantum that he had escalated the costs up to the
valuation date by using a dataset different from the dataset used for the escalation of costs
throughout the same time period in his modern valuation model. As pointed out by
Respondent, relying on the same dataset as in his modern valuation model resulted in an
overall decrease of Prof. Davis’ Capex and Opex estimates from USD 38,689 billion to
USD 37,655 billion over the life of the project.?°? Respondent did not dispute Prof.
Davis’ explanation regarding the source of his corrections. Nor did it provide any further
substantiation as to why this correction should have any impact beyond the slight increase
in value of Claimant’s stake yielded by the updated calculation which, as specified in
Prof. Davis’ errata sheet, corresponded to an increase from USD 3.02 billion to USD 3.18
billion when using a 10% discount rate.

1676.In any event, as noted above, Claimant offered during the Hearing on Quantum not to
rely on the corrected, higher value yielded by the corrected escalation of costs and, in
fact, it relied on the initial, uncorrected figures in both its Closing Presentation and its
Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum.”°** Consequently, the Tribunal sees no reason to attach
any further significance to the correction of the updated calculated that was presented at
the Hearing on Quantum.

1677.As a final point, the Tribunal has taken note of the dispute between the Parties and their
experts with regard to the discount rate to be used when comparing the updated
calculation with the result yielded by Prof. Davis’ valuation model. Prof. Davis relied on
the value yielded by the application of a 10% discount rate whereas Mr. Brailovsky and
Prof. Wells considered that a discount rate of 15% or more would have been appropriate.

1678. Bearing in mind that the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was based on

a traditional DCF analysis, the Tribunal recalls that Prof. Davis agreed in his second
report that, in principle, the modern DCF method and traditional method should lead to
the same value, i.e., the fair market value, of the project. He stated that “[bJoth the
traditional DCF and modern DCF produce an estimate of this FMV, they just come to
that FMV via different approaches to discounting for systematic risk.”?° In his first
report, he had also stated that “modern DCF and traditional DCF are both cash-flow
based models that could, in principle, produce the same FMV for a mining asset.”
However, noting that the traditional DCF method required inputs such as the expected
copper price and a time-varying discount rate over copper risk, which he considered to
be “not easily known,” Prof. Davis considered it “unlikely for the two approaches to
produce the same value, particularly if a constant discount rate is used, as is typical in
the application of the traditional DCF method.” In his opinion, the prevalence of the
modern DCF method was clear: “If the two values are not the same, we know that it is the
traditional approach, which uses non-market information, that is failing to come up with
the market value of the revenue stream. We cannot know whether the traditional method’s
copper price forecast was incorrect, its discount rate was incorrect, or whether both were

incorrect.”?0""

1679. At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Davis confirmed that assuming one would come up

with the right discount rate, the traditional and modern DCF methods should lead to the
same result. He stated:

“That's exactly right. And, in fact, what we do sometimes when we--and
especially when I teach this, I do a simple and I do a modern. I generate the
value in the modern, and I back-calculate what Discount Rate I need in the
simple to come up with the same value. And you get some astounding results.
The Discount Rate that you'd have to use for long-life assets is very low, and
you can imagine why because for a long-life asset, to get all that value, you
can't use 10, 12, or 15 because it will discount away those long-life cash
flows. So, you could, if you knew what the right Discount Rate was, you would
get the same number, exactly.

My belief is the only way you know what the right Discount Rate is, is to do
the modern, get the value, and then impute what Discount Rate you would
need to use in the traditional to get that same value.”?°*

1680. Prof. Davis further confirmed that, in his opinion, due to the compounding factor of the

discount rate, the use of a single discount rate for a 50-year project yielded either
inaccurate results or amounted to “two wrongs making a right”:

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -558-

“ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV. ... If you were to use the traditional DCF
method, you would have to use a different Discount Rate over different
periods of time; is that correct?

THE WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV. It would be incorrect to use the same
Discount Rate to bring it up to that Present Value in the traditional DCF
method from 30 years in the future to today?

THE WITNESS: You could probably find a single Discount Rate that gives
you the right value, but it's two wrongs making a right. So, some firms do use
a constant Discount Rate, but they tend to use a low one, again, because they

don't want it to be compounding that risk over the life of the asset.”?°

1681.Prof. Davis noted that the Feasibility Study had used a 10% real discount rate as the base
case discount rate and added that his calculated value of USD 8.5 billion corresponded to
a multiple of about 2.5 compared to the value yielded by using a 10% discount rate in the
updated calculation.?'” This indicates that the discount rate to be used to arrive at the
value yielded by Prof. Davis’ modern valuation model would have had to be considerably
lower than 10%.

1682. Mr. Septilveda confirmed in his witness statement that while the financial model for the
Feasibility Study presented discount rates in the range of 0% to 12%, “the TCC Board
selected 10% as the indicative rate.” This statement is confirmed by the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study, which states with regard to the use of discount rates:

“Given the complexity and location of the project a 10% discount rate has
been selected as the ‘base case’ discount rate for the EXP Study. In addition,
the asset model also considers discount rates of 0%, 5%, 8%, and 12% for
the calculation of the NPV; these were selected to cover the financial
expectations of the owners.”?!°!

1683. Mr. Septilveda further noted that “[b]ecause of the enormous size of the resource and the
long mine life of 56 years in the IMD case, the discount rate had a significant effect on
the NPV the model produced. This is no surprise, given that NPV only attributes value to
the cash flows created in the initial years of a long-life asset.”*'°? He further explained

why he considered the selection of 10% “reasonable for this kind of model of this asset”:
“Copper projects are usually discounted at a uniform rate of 8%, and gold
projects at 5%, as this is their capital cost. The weighted capital cost for Reko
Dig, as it was a mixture of the two metals, was 7.28%. To this we added a
premium to account for risk associated with investing in Pakistan. That

premium was based on the Pakistani Emerging Market Bond Index (‘EMBI’),
or sovereign spread, of 3.41%. As I explained to others in TCC at the time,
the inclusion of the entire sovereign spread was inappropriate since metals
prices do not depend on the Pakistani economy, and Reko Dig was to be ‘an
export-oriented project with offshore dollar denominated revenues[.]’”?!

1684. As already noted above, Mr. Septilveda further agreed with Prof. Davis that for valuation
purposes even the 10% discount rate may have been considered too high:

“The seller would also try to figure out how to put an appropriate value on
Reko Diq’s enormous, world-class size. At a 10% discount rate a
conventional NPVanalysis gives almost no value for revenues from 15 years
and later. But the Feasibility Study and Pre-Feasibility Study make clear that
this is not just a 15 year mine, and it would command a sale price much higher
than a similar mine that had only a 15 year life. The true value of Reko Diq
lies in the fact that it promised to produce in times of both low and high prices
for decades to come.”?'*

1685.The same was also confirmed by Mr. Luksic who testified:

“A final reason why the NPV in a feasibility study evaluation is often not
reflective of fair market value is the fact that the compounding effect of the
discount rate means that the NPV assigns little if any value beyond the first
decade of the project. The fact that the NPV does not capture a lot of value
beyond the first ten to fifteen years is not a problem when you are simply
trying to determine whether an investment is viable because then you mostly
care about the payback period. But it is a very different story when it comes
to determining the fair market value of an asset. In such a case, it makes
absolutely no sense to assign no value to the full life of mine. It goes without
saying that a sixty-year mine will be worth more than a twelve-year mine.”?!°

1686.In support of this statement, Mr. Luksic referred to the Los Pelambres mine owned by
Antofagasta in Chile:

“The Los Pelambres mine provides a useful illustration of the shortcomings
of a feasibility study NPV. Like Reko Dig, Los Pelambres is a world-class
porphyry copper deposit with a very long life of mine. When the Los
Pelambres Feasibility Study was approved in 1996, it showed a range of
NPVs between US$ 800 million and US$ 1.5 billion. In our view this was a
healthy NPV and it gave us comfort that the mine was a safe investment but
we knew that the mine was actually worth much more. During the mine’s first
sixteen years of operation, it has paid out more than US$ 14 billion in
dividends to our shareholders and has also paid for the several marginal
expansions that have occurred over this period. Furthermore, the resource is

by no means exhausted: based on current expansion proposals, the mine will
be in operation for at least another thirty years.”?!°6
1687.Mr. Luksic considered that buyers would not take the conservative approach used in a
feasibility study for in-house development but rather, “instead of using conservative price
assumptions and a large discount rate in order to determine what the project’s value will
be in the worst-case scenario, buyers use price assumptions that are at—or sometimes
even above—the current prices and a discount rate in the low single digits.” He added
that buyers were thereby “correcting for the conservatism that they know is built into the
feasibility study and compensating for the value of future expansions and for the
discoveries that are likely to be made through further exploration but is simply not
captured in the feasibility study.”?!°’ As an example, Mr. Luksic referred to the sale of a
30% interest in Antucoya by Antofagasta to a Japanese general trading company in
December 2011, noting that the purchase price the company was willing to pay implied

that it had used a copper price of USD 3.50 and a discount rate of 5%.7!°

1688.In the Tribunal’s view, it is clear that the example referred to by Mr. Luksic is not
comparable to Reko Dig in that it concerned a minority interest in a much smaller mine
located in a different part of the world facing different asymmetric risks. However, the
Tribunal does take note of the explanation provided by Prof. Davis, Mr. Septilveda and
Mr. Luksic as to why they considered that even the 10% discount rate used as the base
case in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study yielded a result that
did not reflect the fair market value of the project. In particular, they all referred to the
compounding factor of the discount rate, which has a particular impact on cash flows that
are generated more that 15 or 20 years into the future. In this regard, the Tribunal also
considers it worth recalling the illustration provided by Prof. Davis of discounting cash
flows at a constant 10% discount rate over the anticipated life of the mine:

DCF approach because of price reversion in base metal prices (i.e. the tendency of metal

price to revert to a long-term equilibrium level). This approach may be used if in the

particular situation a standard DCF model with aggregate risk adjustments to the net

cash flow has difficulty recognizing the explicit risk characteristics of a cash flow
stream.”*'? While CIMVal does not explicitly make reference to the discount rate, it does
refer to difficulties that may be implied in using “aggregate risk adjustments to the net
cash flow” in the standard DCF model for a very long-life asset.

1690. Against this background, the Tribunal is not convinced that it was inappropriate for Prof.

Davis to refer in his comparison to the value yielded by the updated calculation at a 10%
discount rate. The Tribunal specifically emphasizes that it thereby does not make a

context of a traditional DCF valuation of the project. Neither Party has provided the
Tribunal with such a valuation and Respondent’s experts have not expressed a definitive
opinion as to the discount rate they would have considered appropriate if it had been
performed. In their first report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells referred to the nominal
discount rate above 23% estimated by Dr. Burrows and noted that they would “expect a
higher rate for the region of western Balochistan where Reko Dig is located,” also stating
that they believed that the discount rate that would acutally be applied by an investor in
2011 would have been “above 30%’; they also noted, however, that “there is no need to
choose an exact number to understand that the project would attract no investor even if
one accepts the optimistic assumptions on which the SNC-Lavalin reports are based.”*!!°
In their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells maintained that the rate above 30%
they had suggested in their first report was “not outrageous and we have seen very high
rates repeatedly in practice and in arbitral decisions, which are applied to projects far
less risky than Reko Dig.” They added, however, that their conclusion did not depend on
the application of 30% discount rate but that “[a]t one third of that rate Reko Dig becomes
uneconomic.”?''' Most importantly, Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells did not provide any
support for their assertion that a buyer would actually have applied a discount rate of 30%
or more to determine the value of the project, other than a reference to Prof. Wells’
involvement in negotiations for a gold mining development in an unidentified other

country.?!!?

1691. In addition, the Tribunal recalls that for the reasons set out in detail above, the calculations
made in the Feasibility Study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study cannot be set equal to
a DCF valuation of the project for the purposes of this arbitration. Mr. Brailovsky and
Prof. Wells did not substantiate in their report that the 10% base case discount rate used
in the Studies did not reflect what was commonly used in technical studies for projects
like Reko Dig. At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Luksic confirmed Mr. Septilveda’s
testimony that the 10% base case discount rate used in the Feasibility Study had been
approved by Claimant’s Board of Directors and by both Antofagasta and Barrick.?!'> He
further testified that he considered both 12% and 10% to be a conservative discount rate
for a feasibility study and that 8% was “more traditional” and “more what we’re normally

using,” whereas 5% could be considered “aggressive.”?!'*

1692.In the specific circumstances of this case and again noting that it is thereby not making a
finding on the appropriateness of a 10% discount rate for a traditional DCF valuation of
a project located in Pakistan, the Tribunal therefore concludes that the best indication of

value to be derived from the updated calculation of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study,
with all the caveats expressed above, is the value calculated by Prof. Davis in his second
report. In the Tribunal’s view, this indication of value calculated at approximately
USD 3 billion for Claimant’s 75% stake in the project, does not contradict the Tribunal’ s
conclusion reached on the basis of Prof. Davis’ modern DCF valuation model, i.e., that
the value of Claimant’s investment amounts to USD 4,087 million.

1693.In the Tribunal’s view, the remaining difference between the valuation and the indication
of value yielded by the updated calculation is explained by the considerations set out in
detail above, in particular that the calculation in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was
not intended to capture the value of the project as reflected in the cash flows to be
generated over the life of the mine. This difference therefore does not warrant a different
conclusion regarding the value of Claimant’s investment.

b. Verification of the Tribunal’s Conclusion Taking Into Account the Past-
Transaction-Based Valuation Performed by Dr. Burrows

1694. The Tribunal will now turn to the valuation performed by Dr. Burrows, which was based
on the past transactions by which Antofagasta and Barrick acquired Claimant in 2006. In
his first report, Dr. Burrows explained his approach to assessing the fair market value of
the project as follows:

“In the context of the circumstances of that project as of the Valuation Date,
fair market value is best assessed based on past transactions, adjusted by
several factors occurring between those transactions and the Valuation Date.
These factors include changes in world metals markets and country risk, as
well as any subsequent efficient, proven investments that might have been
taken into account by a hypothetical buyer of the asset on the Valuation
Date.”2"5

 

1695.Noting that Prof. Davis had identified eight transactions involving mineral assets but
concluded that these were not comparable to Reko Diq, Dr. Burrows considered that Prof.
Davis had failed to consider “an arm’s-length transaction for a property that is much
more comparable to Reko Dig than the eight properties he examined: the September 22,
2006 acquisition by Barrick of 50% of TCC for an amount consistent with a value for
TCC of $246 million.”*!!© He further explained:
“To use this transaction as a basis to calculate the fair market value of TCC’s
interest in Reko Dig on the Valuation Date, I adjust the September 2006
enterprise value for changes in the following factors between September 2006
and the Valuation Date: (a) changes in expectations about metals prices, (b)
inflation in costs of production in the world mining industry, (c) changes in

the general cost of capital for metals mines, and (d) changes in Pakistan
country risk. I also consider expenditures by TCC subsequent to September
2006 and changes in expected capital expenditures and operating costs.

The first three factors (changes in expectations of copper and gold prices,
general inflation in mining costs, and changes in the general cost of capital
for copper and gold mining) are factors that are common to all copper and
gold projects. I therefore adjust for the effects of these factors by escalating
the September 2006 transaction value using published indices of share prices
of copper and gold mining companies. I then adjust for the increase in country
risk between 2006 and 2011.”?'"7

1696.On that basis, Dr. Burrows accounted for an average increase in value of 78% for gold
mining companies and 107% for copper mining companies, resulting in a weighted
average increase of 104%. He then made an adjustment for “the effect of higher country
risk,” which he determined on the basis of Pakistan’s sovereign yield spread. Noting that
the sovereign yield spread increased from 2.5% in September 2006 to 12.1% in November
2011, he determined that the cost of capital for Reko Diq had increased from 14.5% in
2006 to 24.2% in 2011 and that the present value of cash flows had therefore declined by
70% due to the increased country risk. He emphasized that the 24.2% estimate “is not an
estimate of the cost of capital as of November 2011; rather, it reflects the 2006 cost of
capital adjusted for changes in country risk.” According to Dr. Burrows, these
adjustments resulted in an adjusted transaction value on the valuation date of USD 150.4
million.2""8
1697.Dr. Burrows further noted that Claimant had incurred expenditures in the amount of USD

219 million after the transaction date but saw “no basis for adding value to the adjusted
transaction value of $150.4 million”:

“To the extent that these expenditures were proven, efficient, and relevant to

the development of Reko Dig, they might add value to a potential purchaser

on the Valuation Date. However, I understand that many of these

expenditures were not productive or efficient and that many costs were

incurred for purposes not related to the development of the property that is

the subject of this dispute. Costs that were unproductive and inefficient, and

costs related to other assets than EL-5, would not add value to the value of

TCC’s interest in EL-5. As noted in footnote 30, the expected metals

production did not increase between 2006 and 2011. Furthermore even costs

that were productive, efficient, and related to the assets that are subject to

this dispute would probably not be valued dollar for dollar by a prospective

buyer, as the buyer would probably wish to invest development expenditures

to satisfy its own standards and approaches for developing a mineral deposit.

As the Claimant has provided little detail on the expenditures between 2006

and 2011, I have no basis for adding any value to the adjusted transaction
value of $150.4 million for TCC’s interest in EL-5.”!!°

1698. Specifically with regard to his assumption that “the expected metals production did not
increase between 2006 and 2011,” Dr. Burrows considered it “reasonable to believe that,
when [the buyers of TCC which were two of the world’s largest mining companies]
entered that acquisition in 2006, they had a good understanding of the total resource
base.” In terms of documentary evidence, Dr. Burrows referred to a news article on the
acquisition by Antofagasta as well as “[a] spreadsheet apparently prepared by
Antofagasta or its advisors on February 16, 2006” and compared the expected total
recoverable copper and gold in that spreadsheet with the projected total recoverable

copper and gold in the Financial Asset Model of the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study.”!”°

1699. Prof. Davis commented on Dr. Burrows’ approach in his second report, considering the
calculation “futile, because the asset in that one trade, Reko Dig in 2006, is fundamentally
different from Reko Dig in 2011.” In his opinion, “critical knowledge had been gained
about the asset between 2006 and 2011 that fundamentally changed its value.” Prof.
Davis noted that his own screening algorithm for comparable transactions had “rejected
the transaction as not useful” because Reko Diq had then not been in the feasibility or
pre-production stage but was classified as in the earlier “Reserves Development’ stage.”!*!

In his opinion, “Reko Dig in 2006 is not reasonably similar to Reko Dig on the Valuation

Date, and no adjustment or set of adjustments is possible to account reliably for the full

scope of differences.”?!??

1700. According to Prof. Davis, a “key criterion for comparability” is the development stage of
the project. He noted that Reko Diq went from a Mineral Resource Property in 2006 to a
Development Property in 2011, which had “completed a successful bankable feasibility
study, had more certainty in the resource estimate, and was being heralded as a world-
class asset.”?!*3 Prof. Davis added:

“Between 2006 and 2011, Reko Dig went up the mine value curve. By 2011,
four technical studies had been completed, at a cost of over $125 million and
totaling thousands of pages, and managing to get the project past the
feasibility study stage. According to Enders and Leveille, respected geologists
in the mining industry, there is only a 20% chance that a project at the
scoping study stage will get to the feasibility study stage due to technical and
economic risks. The market value of Reko Dig in early 2006 would reflect a
discount for the low probability of getting to a successful scoping study, let

alone to feasibility (and later into production). However, once that stage is

achieved, that discount is removed. Thus, Reko Dig in 2006 is fundamentally

different from Reko Dig in 2011.”?'**

1701.Prof. Davis considered that the amount of resources and reserves also constituted a

fundamental difference. He stated that while the project had had indicated resources and
a large amount of inferred resources in 2006, the additional drilling conducted after 2006,
which amounted to 80% of the cumulative drilling, “both found additional Resources and
provided additional confidence in the existing Resource such that the Inferred Resources
could be transformed into Measured and Indicated Resources.” *!” Prof. Davis illustrated
the increases in both categories of resources as well as the increase in measured &
indicated contained metal as follows:7!”°

purchase date and 2011” and that “[t]he Inferred Resources and Mineral Inventory as of
2011 could, if proved up, extend the mine life by nearly 50%,” Prof. Davis expressed the
opinion that “[t]his difference in resources and classification makes Reko Dig in 2011
fundamentally different from Reko Dig in 2006.”?'?"

1703.On that basis, Prof. Davis rejected Dr. Burrows’ statement that “the expected metals

production did not increase between 2006 and 2011” and expressed the opinion that the
comparison he had drawn between the 2006 spreadsheet, which he described as
“prepared by Antofagasta,” and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study was “inappropriate
because the 2006 spreadsheet includes all resources, including Inferred, known at the
time, while the EXP PFS values cited by Dr. Burrows only include Measured and
Indicated resources.” He added that “[a] fair, like-to-like comparison of Reko Diq’s 2011
resource base with the 2006 Antofagasta spreadsheet would include the Inferred
resources as of 2011. Such a comparison implies a 2.4x increase in the size of the total
resource between 2006 and 2011.” Prof. Davis therefore maintained his opinion that
“[t]he increased size and confidence level in Reko Diq’s resource base by 2011 makes the
property incomparable with itself in 2006.”?!?

1704. Prof. Davis identified several additional reasons why he considered the 2011 project to

be “fundamentally different” from the 2006 project. These reasons included, inter alia:
(i) the project’s stripping ratio which was “far superior to the industry average” but had
not been known in 2006; (ii) economies of scale which would have lowered the project’s
costs of production but which had not been known in 2006 when the rate of economic
production was still unclear; and (iii) the specific location of Reko Diq the risks of which
would not be reflected in the sovereign yield spread which instead reflected other
developments such as the government’s debt and severe flooding in 2010 and 2011.7!?°

1705.Prof. Davis further considered that the magnitude of the “Jarge and subjective

adjustments to the deal value” made by Dr. Burrows “is evidence in itself that Reko Diq
in 2006 is not comparable and that therefore the method cannot be applied reliably,” as
“each of Dr. Burrows’ adjustments, which range from twice to almost four times the
original transaction value, overwhelms whatever signal of value the transaction
reflected.”*'*® Prof. Davis illustrated the magnitude of Dr. Burrows’ adjustments as

Workpaper R28,

1706. Prof. Davis also criticized these adjustments as “flawed.” Specifically, he considered that
Dr. Burrows’ use of two mining indices to adjust for the value impact of market factors
between 2006 and 2011 was “in theory reasonable, though in practice imprecise” as it
would have been applied to “any copper gold project with the same copper-gold ratio in
any country, at any stage, underground or open pit, high grade or low grade, high cost
or low cost, remote or accessible, artic or desert, heavily taxed or lightly taxed, and so
on.” Prof. Davis further expressed the opinion that “[t]here is no reason to believe that
the average share price change of the companies in the sample, and what it implies about
the change in their project values, applies to a Resource stage project like Reko Dig.”?!**

Prof. Davis also pointed to an adjustment made by Dr. Burrows to account for time effects

by advancing the weighted average timing of cash flows by 5.2 years and noted that each

of these two adjustments had more than doubled the value, which confirmed in his opinion

that the 2006 comparison could not be considered a valid comparison trade.?!*7

1707.In particular, however, Prof. Davis critized the adjustment for country risk that Dr.
Burrows made on the basis of Pakistan’s sovereign yield spread and “[w]ithout taking
into account any specifics of the Project,” which lowered the value of Reko Diq by 85%.
Apart from his disagreement with the use of the sovereign yield spread to determine the
country risk premium to be added to the cost of capital, Prof. Davis argued in particular
that Dr. Burrows failed to account for the fact that certain country risks would already be
reflected in the indices of mining companies and ignored that the “extreme value

discount” of 85% was not supported by the performance of Pakistani oil and gas

companies which indicated only a decrease in value of up to 20%.7!*+

1708.In addition to his criticisms of the adjustments that Dr. Burrow had made, Prof. Davis
expressed the opinion that “Dr. Burrows ignores all of these project-specific effects and
does not make any adjustment for the improvements to the asset that TCC made in the
five years since it was acquired by Barrick and Antofagasta, despite calculating that TCC
spent $219 million in exploration, evaluation, and development expenditures between
July 1, 2006 and December 31, 2011.” In particular, Prof. Davis referred to the absence
of adjustments for stage of development and reserves and concluded that “[n]ot making
adjustments for these factors leaves Dr. Burrows’ analysis incomplete and

unreliable.”?15

1709. In his second report, Dr. Burrows maintained his analysis and conclusion. He emphasized
that his analysis was not based on an assessment of comparable properties but rather a
transaction involving Reko Dig itself and expressed the opinion that “[mlost of the factors
that vary across mineral properties do not vary significantly for Reko Dig itself between
the two dates. For those that do vary (such as metals prices, mining industry costs,
general costs of capital, local country risk, incremental investments in the property, and

time to production), I adjust for the variations.”?'°°

1710. With regard to the criteria listed by Prof. Davis as not or insufficiently accounted for in
the adjustments, Dr. Burrows reiterated that “the parties involved in the transaction were
not naive and uninformed.” In his opinion, “Professor Davis would have the reader
conclude that in such a highly contested transaction, the buyers would have hoodwinked
the sellers (who would be likely to know much more about the property than the buyers)
by paying $246 million when according to Professor Davis it was actually worth over $8

billion dollars (after a further expenditure of just several hundred million dollars).”?'*"

1711.Dr. Burrows maintained that he had relied on common sense as well as on a document
prepared by Antofagasta which “demonstrate[d] that the parties at the time of the
transaction had a very accurate understanding of the resource base of Reko Dig and of
the costs of extracting and recovering the metals.” He noted that the information used as
a basis for this document could only have come from the seller and eliminated the need
to speculate about what was known by the transacting parties in 2006. According to Dr.
Burrows, the additional development work conducted until 2011 even “resulted in
negative surprises about metals production and costs between 2006 and 2011” as the total

amount of ore milled (both copper and gold) decreased whereas initial and sustaining
capital expenditures as well as operating expenditures increased.?'** Dr. Burrows did not
dispute Prof. Davis’ statement that the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study included only
Measured and Indicated Resources but argued:
“The key facts are that the 2006 document represented the buyer’s projection
of production and costs at that time and the 2010 technical study also
represented the projections of production and costs at that time. The two
production projections are nearly the same. Any additional resources
delineated as of 2010 that were not represented in the production projections
were obviously not in the future production plans.””!

1712.As for Prof. Davis’ distinction between the development stages of a Mineral Resource
Property and a Development Property, Dr. Burrows considered this to be “a semantic

distinction without a difference.” In his opinion:
“The relevant factor is that the buyers in 2006 made a projection of
production that was very similar to their projection four years later, and
based an acquisition decision on that projection. It is clear from the
contemporaneous valuation document that the buyers did not apply a
discount for any semantic distinction about stage of production. The
information available at the time to the transacting parties on Reko Dig was
sufficient to provide a highly accurate projection of its production
potential.”?\°
1713.Dr. Burrows considered that the transacting parties had been “well aware of the scale of
the resource in 2006” and projected a mine life of 45 years with approximately the same
life-of-mine production as the 2010 Base Case with a 55-year mine life, thus
contemplating an even larger mine with similar scale benefits. He also noted that contrary
to Prof. Davis’ suggestions, the 2006 spreadsheet did include an estimate of operating
costs and maintained that “the projected costs of production increased dramatically
between 2006 and 2011.” Dr. Burrows also addressed Prof. Davis’ further criticisms and
maintained that these adjustments were either insignificant or would have led to a

downward adjustment in his calculation.?!4!

1714. Specifically, with regard to Prof. Davis’ argument that he failed to account for the
increased geologic certainty and more advanced stage of the project, Dr. Burrows argued:

“Professor Davis seems to be confusing changes in value from expenditures
that are needed to develop the mine, changes in expected production and
costs, and the appropriate discount rate for valuing the expected future cash
flow stream. A mine increases in value over time as expenditures are made

on exploration, drilling, feasibility studies and mine plans (i.e., as sunk costs
at the time of valuation increase and remaining development costs decline),
as expected production increases or costs decline as a result of additional
discoveries over time, and as the time remaining until production commences
declines. I have accounted for all of these effects.”?'47

1715.Specifically, Dr. Burrows stated that: (i) he had found that expected production did not
increase between 2006 and 2011 as a result of which no adjustment was necessary in that
regard; (ii) he had made an upward adjustment to account for the reduction in time to
construction; (iii) he had considered the value of expenditures incurred by Claimant but
found that there was not sufficient detail to determine the amount spent on Reko Diq and,
relying on Respondent’s expert Prof. Dagdelen, that “much of the expenditures were
redundant or ineffective” as a result of which he was “unable to attribute any increased
value to the project as a result of investments made after the 2006 transaction date.”
Noting that Antofagasta had expected in 2006 to spend USD 75 million during the
development period, Dr. Burrows added that “a maximum estimate of any increment in
value between 2006 and 2011 as a result of further investments made to advance the
project is $75 million, the estimate Antofagasta, an experienced mining company, made

at the time of the transaction.”?'

1716. According to Dr. Burrows, “[t]he resolution of geologic uncertainty can only have an
impact on value if it changes the expectation of the mine’s cash flows.” Depending on the
expectation of the parties before technical studies are conducted and the impact of
subsequent development work on these initial expectations, these studies could “increase,

decrease or have no effect on value.” Dr. Burrows argues that “ex post values change

because in the process of reducing uncertainty the expected values change” but not
because of the reduction of uncertainty itself. He considered:

“The original ex ante expectation was a statistical expectation, or average,
of possible outcomes. There is no need to discount this ex ante value for
idiosyncratic technical risks. This is because technical uncertainty is a
diversifiable risk and therefore investors do not take such risks into account
in valuing the project. With respect to the Reko Dig project, between 2006
and 2010 expected metals production declined and expected capital and
operating costs increased. The resolution of technical uncertainty during this
period resulted in a reduction in value ex post.”?!*4

1717.Dr. Burrows further rejected Prof. Davis’ characterization of his adjustments as

“subjective,” arguing that they were based on “objective, appropriate, and transparent
data.” As for the use of mining indices, Dr. Burrows agreed that “there is some

imprecision in the adjustment” but did not consider this to be significant as there was “no

reason to believe that Reko Dig is so different from other copper-gold mining projects
that the effects of changes in these underlying factors would be significantly different for
Reko Dig than for the average of other companies” and the effects cited by Prof. Davis
were either “trivial” or “immaterial” or would only result in a downward adjustment of
Reko Diq’s value.”'*° Dr. Burrows further rejected the suggestion that his approach was
double-counting country risk, noting that “a large proportion of mining asset values is in
low-risk countries” and it was “unlikely that the change in aggregate country risk in the

indices is related with the change in the Pakistan country risk.”?'46

1718.Dr. Burrows also rejected Prof. Davis’ assertion that he had not made adjustments specific

to Reko Diq and pointed to his adjustments for reduced production development time
until construction and for the increased country risk in Pakistan.7!47 Dr. Burrows
maintained that the latter adjustment was appropriate, as the oil and gas companies in
Pakistan referred to by Prof. Davis were either government controlled or Pakistani
controlled, which rendered them “irrelevant,” and these companies had all been
producing oil and gas between 2006 and 2011, which meant that they had a different

exposure to country risk than the pre-production project Reko Dig.?!4*

1719.Dr. Burrows argued that his approach to measuring country risk based on the sovereign

spread was commonly used by practitioners and that such a method would also have been
used by “most if not all potential buyers (and bankers) of a project such as Reko Diq.”?!*”
He also rejected the argument that Pakistan’ sovereign yield spread had increased
between 2006 and 2011 for reasons unrelated to risks affecting private investments and
maintained that it was an adequate measure for country risk affecting the Reko Dig project
because “(i) there is significant agreement by researchers and practitioners that private
risks are correlated with sovereign spreads, and (ii) though there may be disagreement
as to whether the appropriate level of such risks is higher or lower than the sovereign
spread, it is reasonable to use the sovereign spread itself both as a compromise across
such disagreements and to reflect methods used by practitioners and that are highly likely

to be used by potential buyers of the project.”?'°

1720.As a final point, Dr. Burrows noted that while he had assumed in his first report that as

of 2011, the project was five years closer to production than in 2006, the time period

only about one year closer to production than as of the 2006 transaction date.” Dr.

Burrows therefore revised his estimate of the 2011 adjusted value to USD 61.2 million.
Further assuming that the amount of USD 75 million that Antofagasta expected to spend
on the development of the project (USD 88 million in 2011 dollars) had in fact been spent
as of the valuation date, he concluded that the maximum estimate of the value of the

project as of the valuation date amounted to USD 149.2 million.?!*!

1721.The Tribunal has taken note of the fact that the value calculated by Dr. Burrows is

significantly lower than the value yielded by Prof. Davis’ modern DCF valuation model,
even after making all of the additional deductions made by the Tribunal in its detailed
assessment above. Prof. Davis has not presented an alternative figure for Dr. Burrows’
market-based approach that would reflect the adjustments he would have considered more
appropriate; he rather argued that the project in 2006 cannot reasonably be compared to
the project in 2011. At the Hearing on Quantum, he summarized the reasons for his
opinion as follows:

“Dr. Burrows used the Reko Dig trade in 2006 as being comparable to the
Reko Dig Fair Market Valuation in 2011. In my view, they were different
assets. In 2006 it was pre-scoping. It did have a resource base, but it had not
had one technical study completed. By 2011, it had several technical studies
completed. It had a Mining Lease. It had a Mine Plan. And it had had 290
kilometers of additional drilling that had identified where the resource body
was, where the high-grade and low-grade zones were, what the mining pits
should look like, where the plant should be located so as not to cover any of
the viable mineralization. There was sampling for the pilot plant and testing.
An awful lot had happened to de-risk the Project, as we say, in the industry,
and bring it to a development property from a mineral resource property. And
that de-risking adds substantial value to a property.

Incidentally, while that de-risking was happening, the amount of Measured
and Indicated copper and gold virtually doubled, on the left-hand side, and
the Inferred Resources more than doubled, on the right-hand side. So, the
scope of the Project grew. Dr. Burrows does not include in his analysisany of
that project advancing other than in ... his second approach, where he
attributes USD75 million roughly to the incremental value from that drilling
or from that advancement.”?!>*

1722.Prof. Davis considered his opinion regarding the differences in market circumstances

confirmed by the magnitude of the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows, in particular by his
adjustment for country risk which Dr. Burrows determined based on an approach with
which Prof. Davis disagreed. Prof. Davis illustrated the revised adjustments made in Dr.

1723.In addition to the adjustments that Dr. Burrows had made, the second major point of
disagreement between the Parties’ experts concerned the adjustments he had not made,
in particular the question whether Dr. Burrows should have accounted for an increase in
value created by the additional exploration work and studies carried out after the 2006
transaction as a result of which the project went from the development stage of a Mineral
Resource Property to a Development Property.

1724. The Tribunal is aware that there are several additional points of disagreement between
the experts regarding allegedly lacking or incorrect adjustments. However, the Tribunal
considers that if it reaches the conclusion that Dr. Burrows should have accounted for an
increase in value created between 2006 and 2011 and there is therefore a reasonable
explanation for the deviation between the results yielded by both approaches, it is not
necessary to examine the additional points of disagreement in further detail.

1725.In the Tribunal’s view, Dr. Burrows’ approach to value the project based on a past
transaction involving the very same project might generally appear plausible. It is
undisputed, however, that the transaction occurred more than five years before the
valuation date and that during this time period, considerable changes affecting the value
of the project occurred. Apart from undisputed developments with regard to market prices
and costs as well as the disputed factor of country risk, Claimant carried out a significant
amount of exploration work. As the Tribunal has already set out in detail in its Decision
on Jurisdiction and Liability, Claimant expanded the scope of its exploration program
following the acquisition by Antofagasta from Tanjeel to other ore deposits within Reko

Digq, in particular the orebodies at the Western Porphyries.!*

1726.Based on the results of its drilling programs, Claimant also continuously revised its
estimates of the mineral resources contained in these orebodies. The Decision on

Jurisdiction and Liability explicitly records the following developments: (i) in a meeting
of the Operating Committee held on 11 February 2006, Claimant stated that “the drilling
program had now demonstrated the world class potential of the Reko Dig caldera with a
global resource of over 2 billion tones”;?'* (ii) at the OC meeting held on 15 July 2006,
Claimant reported that the total indicated and inferred resources at all of the examined
orebodies were estimated at “2.42 billion tonnes @ 0.51% copper and 0.27/t gold”?!°6
(iii) in its Quarterly Report for the period ended 31 December 2006, Claimant reported
that the indicated and inferred mineral resources at the Western Porphyries (i.e.,
excluding the other ore deposits included in the other estimates), currently stood at “/.6/
billion tonnes @ 0.54% copper and 0.30g/t gold’;?'>" and (iv) following additional
exploration work and completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study for Initial Mine
Development in July 2009, Claimant reported in the Pre-Feasibility Study that the total
amount of measured, indicated and inferred resources at all of the examined ore deposits
amounted to a grand total of 4.701 billion tonnes @ 0.48% copper and 0.28g/t gold as of
May 2009.7!58 The Tribunal specifically noted that this represented a nearly 100%

increase over the mineral resource estimate that Claimant had produced in early 2006.”!°°

1727.As noted above, an essential point in Dr. Burrows’ argument as to why he considered it
appropriate not to make any adjustment for the additional exploration work carried out
by Claimant after the 2006 transaction was that in his opinion, reducing geologic
uncertainty did not produce value in itself but only if it resulted in an increase in the
expected production of copper and/or gold, thereby increasing the expected cash flows.
However, relying on a comparison between the production projected in a spreadsheet
prepared shortly before the acquisition of Claimant by Antofagasta in February 2006 and
the production projected in the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study, he concluded that the
amount of recoverable copper and gold had not increased but in fact even decreased
between 2006 and 2011 and that production projections were nearly the same while
production costs increased. At the Hearing on Quantum, Dr. Burrows illustrated this

comparison in the following table:?!°

1728.Prof. Davis, on the other hand, pointed out that the projection of the Expansion Pre-

spreadsheet had largely consisted of inferred resources. He pointed out that, as the
Tribunal already noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the amounts of
measured / indicated resources and inferred resources increased between 2006 and 2011,

reserves and measures, indicated and inferred resources, type of mining and

lives 7212

1730.Dr. Burrows testified that the factors he had listed in the interview were “not significantly”
different for Reko Dig between 2006 and 2011.7!®? Specifically with regard to the amount
of measured and indicated resources, his testimony was as follows:

“Q. ... Now, am I right that the amount of Measured and Indicated Resources
and the amount of Inferred Resources doubled from 2006 to 2011?

A. In terms of what they reported, the issue is what did they know was there?
And here, if you're just looking--if you're just doing a paper study and you're
comparing two projects and all you have is what was reported, it would look
different. But here we know from facts and circumstances that the Parties had
a good grasp at what was there in 2006, that there was no real change.

Q. Sorry; but you accept in your article where you're giving an interview.
you say the amount of Reserves and Resources matters to comparability
right?

 
  

A. It's one of the things being looked at, and I just explained why in this case
it's not relevant. The expected size of the project didn't change.

Q. So, if--so, in your view, it wasn't--it's not a relevant distinction that at the
time of the 2006 transaction, it only had, let's say, half of the Measured and
Indicated Resources that it had then in 2011?

That's not relevant?

A. What would be relevant is if the knowledge of what was there changed
significantly between 2006 and 2011. What you're talking about is what they
were able to report, not what they expected.”?'*

1731. When asked about the importance of “the level of confidence that you have into what you
know” in the mining industry, Dr. Burrows expressed the opinion that it was “an example
of a nonsystematic risk which isn't priced in the financial markets.” He did not dispute
that level of confidence was one of the characteristics that moved a project from one
development stage to the other but noted that “the other thing that is going to have to
moved from one stage to another is you spent money” for which he had accounted in his
calculation. He maintained that the level of confidence “actually doesn’t improve the
economic value unless it changes the expected value.””'® Dr. Burrows acknowledged that
this sounded rather circular but confirmed:

“Q. ... [A]re you really testifying that moving the property from Mineral
Resource stage with a certain amount of Inferred Resources to a Development
Stage property with twice the amount of Measured and Indicated Resources
and twice the amount of Inferred Resources added no value worthy of an
adjustment in your approach?

A. I believe because of the facts and circumstances of this deposit, there was
a value increase. I measured it at USD 88 million. But just simply changing
the words on how you describe it didn't add value because the Parties ...
didn't change their expectations about the output between those two
dates.”?'%

1732.Dr. Burrows confirmed that his opinion regarding the knowledge and understanding of
the resource base that Antofagasta had at the time it acquired Claimant was based on a
spreadsheet prepared in February 2006. He clarified with regard to the origin of the
spreadsheet that in his first report he had not been aware of the source of the spreadsheet,
which had been “handed over as part of a set of documents that were represented by
Antofagasta’s documents showing how they valued the property.” After Prof. Davis had
referred to it as an Antofagasta document in his second report, he had assumed this to be
correct. Dr. Burrows added that “[w]e have since learned that the document was prepared
by an analyst, but that doesn't really change anything, in my mind. Analysts get their
information from the company. I was a CEO of a public company for 10 years, so I know
how it works. Analysts don't go off and do a whole lot of research on their own.”?!©’ Dr.
Burrows considered that “when this analyst got this data, he obviously had somehow got
information. How he got it, I don't know, probably somebody in the company told him.”
He denied that this was speculation on his part, rather calling it “an informed judgment
based on my experience with analysts.” Dr. Burrows confirmed that when he prepared his
second report he had been “under the mistaken impression ... that this was an Antofagasta
document” but maintained: “Jf I had known at the time it was an analyst's document, I
think I would have reached the same conclusions, because it has very detailed information
after 45 years, on a number of factors that the analyst didn't just make up.”?'® He
clarified that he was “not speculating that the analyst was involved in the purchase. I’m
just saying from my experience with analysts’ work, they talk to the company. The
companies will usually help them a bit, and he was able to produce an analysis. It was

remarkably close to what the actual plan was four years later.”?!

1733.Based on the explanations provided by Dr. Burrows in his reports and in his oral
testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal is not convinced by Dr. Burrows’
arguments as to why he considered that no adjustment was warranted to account for the

increased level of confidence regarding the resource estimates at Reko Diq. Besides the
fact that it became clear at the Hearing that the spreadsheet on which Dr. Burrows had
relied in making his comparison was not prepared by Antofagasta itself but rather by an
analyst who may or may not have received information from Antofagasta beyond the
publicly available information at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that
the considerable increase of measured / indicated resources and inferred resources was
entirely irrelevant to the valuation of the project. As pointed out by Prof. Davis, the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estimates of contained copper and gold increased from 2006 to 2011 as follows:?!”°

1734.The Tribunal is not convinced by Dr. Burrows’ argument that an increased level of
confidence is relevant only if it also increases the amount of projected production. Again
besides the uncertainty as to whether the spreadsheet on which Dr. Burrows based his
comparison of projected production between 2006 and 2011 indeed reflected internal
estimates made by Antofagasta at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it likely that a
buyer determining the fair market value of the project in 2011 would not attach any value
to an increased level of confidence into the fact that the resource is actually there and that
the projected quantities of production are technically and economically feasible. Between
2006 and 2011, Claimant carried out significant amounts of exploration work, completed
a Scoping Study, an Initial Mine Development Pre-Feasibility Study, the Initial Mine
Development Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study. As reflected in
the resource estimates set out above, Claimant thereby managed to achieve a significantly
increased level of confidence regarding the resource base at Reko Diq which is reflected
particularly in the estimate of measured resources. As pointed out by Claimant, Dr.
Burrows himself explained in an article outside this arbitration that the stage of

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -580-

development and the amount of measured, indicated and inferred resources are among
the factors affecting the value of mineral properties.

1735.The Tribunal is also not convinced by Dr. Burrows’ testimony that he fully accounted for
the increase in value created by the work carried out by Claimant by adding the amount
of projected expenditures to his adjusted transaction value. Besides the fact that the
Tribunal is not convinced by the basis for Dr. Burrows’ decision to recognize only the
amount projected in the 2006 analyst spreadsheet rather than the amount of USD 219
million that Claimant actually spent on its further exploration work, the Tribunal also
does not find it plausible that the work carried out by Claimant increased the value of the
project only by the amount of (projected) expenditures. Dr. Burrows maintained at the
Hearing on Quantum that “[y]ou wouldn’t expect to get more than the money you spent

2171 and that Claimant

on it, unless you made some discovery that wasn’t known before’
“did work that didn’t change the expected value” but only “[r]educed the risk somewhat”
which, however, did not add value because it concerned only asymmetric risk.2!”? At the
same time, however, Dr. Burrows confirmed that “[t]he property was further advanced
between 2006 and 2011” and also agreed that the distinction between mineral resource
stage and development stage had some meaningful significance in the mining industry.”!7
In the Tribunal’s view, it is not plausible that this transition would have an impact on

value only if “some discovery” is made but not to account for an increased level of
confidence that the discovered resources exist and can be economically extracted from
the ground. In addition, the Tribunal is also not convinced that even on Dr. Burrows’
argument, no such “discovery” was made. As pointed out by Prof. Davis and already
noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the amount of inferred, indicated and
measured resources nearly doubled between early 2006 and mid-2009. Dr. Burrows’
explanation as to why he does not consider this development a value-increasing
“discovery” does not convince the Tribunal.

1736. Consequently, the Tribunal believes that Dr. Burrows did not adequately account for the
increase in value created by the additional exploration work carried out by Claimant
between 2006 and 2009 as well as the pre-feasibility and feasibility studies completed by
Claimant in 2009 and 2010. Given that Dr. Burrows has not made any adjustment besides
the addition of projected expenditures in this regard, the Tribunal considers that his value
estimate cannot serve to help identifying or verifying the fair market value of the project
as of the valuation date.

1737.The Tribunal therefore also does not consider it necessary to examine the several
additional areas of disagreement between the Parties’ experts in further detail. In

particular, the Tribunal does not see the need to make a finding on the appropriateness of
the adjustments that Dr. Burrows has made to account for increased prices and costs as
well as for country risk. It suffices to note at this point that, as criticized by Prof. Davis,
the adjustments made by Dr. Burrows appear to be rather general and detached from any
project-specific considerations as they are largely based on mining indices and the
sovereign yield spread of Pakistan. Specifically with regard to the latter, the Tribunal has
already set out above why it is not convinced that the sovereign yield spread reflects the
country-related risks faced by the project in the present circumstances. In the present
context, the Tribunal specifically does not consider it established that the sovereign
spread reflected the perception of country risk that Claimant’s owners included in the
purchase price they were willing to pay in 2006 or that the spread’s increase reflected an
increase in the country risk as perceived by a buyer of the project in 2011. More generally,
the Tribunal is not convinced that Dr. Burrows’ adjustments, which, beyond the projected
start of construction and the project’s location in Pakistan, did not take into account any
project-specific factors, would result in a more adequate estimate of the project’s fair
market value than the very project-specific risk adjustments made by Prof. Davis in his
modern DCF model.

1738.On that basis, the Tribunal also does not consider it necessary to explore in further detail

whether the market-based approach used by Dr. Burrows would have been considered a
relevant indication of value by a buyer. The Tribunal only notes that Dr. Burrows
confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum that, contrary to what was indicated in his first
report, he had been “instructed to determine the value based on the 2006 transaction” and
was “not instructed to look at other potential avenues for valuing” as “another Expert ...
was looking at DCF.”*'”* He also testified:

“Q. ... [A]m I right that, in all those decades you have been consulting with

minerals companies, you have never seen them make any major investment

decision based on a comparable transaction analysis?

A. I think that's pretty true.

Q. And every major investment decision you have seen a mining company

make has been based on Discounted Cash Flow analysis; right?

A. Well, at least the ones I've been involved in that I've seen or that I've seen
in my work. I think companies will use comparable numbers to screen
acquisitions, but when they get an actual one, they usually use a DCF, if they
can.

Q. Well, no. I want to be precise about this, that you have never seen any
major investment decision made on the basis of a comparable; right?

A. Except as a confirmation.

Q. And every single instance will be based on discounted Present Value;
right?

A. Usually, yes.

Q. No. Every single instance that you've seen; right?

A. Yes, Yes.”2175

1739. While Dr. Burrows testified that he had seen the use of comparable transaction analysis
“as a confirmation” of a DCF analysis, his testimony was very clear as to the prevalence
of income-based valuation methods in valuing mining projects. In the Tribunal’s view,
this confirms its conclusion that the valuation performed by Dr. Burrows, which did not
account for any increase in value created by Claimant’s work after 2006, cannot serve to
call into question the result reached on the basis of Prof. Davis’ modern DCF valuation
model. More specifically, the Tribunal considers that there is a reasonable explanation
for the deviation between the values yielded by the two valuations and therefore does not
see any basis for revisiting the conclusion it has reached on the value of Claimant’s
investment above.

c. Conclusion on the Verification of the Tribunal’s Conclusion on the Value of
Claimant’s Investment

1740.In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the results yielded by the other valuation or
evaluation methods relied on by Respondent’s experts or contemporaneously applied by
TCCA do not warrant any adjustments to the conclusion that the Tribunal has reached on
the basis of Prof. Davis’ modern DCF valuation model above.

1741.As a final point, the Tribunal considers that this result is also in line with generally
recognized principles of valuation as referred to in the second sentence of Article 7(2) of
the Treaty. The Tribunal found above that it is not required to resort to those principles,
which are set out in that sentence as additional criteria for determining the market value
of Claimant’s investment, because the value can be “readily ascertained” on the basis of
the Prof. Davis’ valuation model. The Tribunal nevertheless decided to take due account
of those principles of valuation. Based on all of the considerations set out above, the
Tribunal is, in particular, convinced that the compensation awarded to Claimant is also
reconcilable with the amount of capital invested by Claimant. As discussed in its
assessment of the market-based valuation presented by Dr. Burrows, the Tribunal
considers it plausible that by investing an amount of over USD 240 million into the
exploration of Reko Dig and by creating a detailed plan on how to economically extract
the minerals from the ground, as reflected in the Feasibility Study and the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study, Claimant has significantly increased the value of the project. The

Tribunal has not accepted Dr. Burrows’ suggestion that the value would increase only by
the amount invested. It rather follows the economically sound argument that by increasing
the geologic certainty of the resource and, more generally, by decreasing the risks
affecting future cash flows that can be obtained from the project, Claimant raised the
value of its investment by far more than the amount of capital invested. In the Tribunal’s
view, this increase of value is captured by Prof. Davis’ income-based valuation
methodology; it is not captured by Dr. Burrows’ backward-looking, market-based
approach and it is also not captured by the — equally backward-looking — assessment of
the amount of capital invested.

1742. Consequently, the Tribunal maintains its conclusion that for the reasons set out in detail
above, the value of Claimant’s investment amounts to USD 4,087 million.

G. _ Pre-award and Post-award Interest

1743. Finally, the Tribunal will address Claimant’s request for an award of pre-award and post-
award interest on the amount of compensation owed to it by Respondent.

1. Summary of Claimant’s Position

1744. Claimant submits that the principle of full reparation requires that it be awarded pre-award
and post-award compound interest at Respondent’s borrowing cost. Claimant notes that
Respondent accepts the necessity to award pre-award and post-award interest and the
compensatory function of interest but argues that, while the compensatory function is
indeed “the primary function of interest at international law,” tribunals have a “wide
margin of discretion in awarding interest” and should also take into account two further
functions of interest, i.e., to “prevent unjust enrichment of the respondent” and to “ensure

efficiency in the arbitral process.”?'°

1745.In Claimant’s view, interest should be calculated at either: (i) Respondent’s short-term,
unsecured, dollar-denominated borrowing rate, which corresponds to an annualized
compound rate of 4% and reflects the market price of Pakistan’s default risk that Claimant
has borne since the date of Respondent’s Treaty braches and will continue to bear until
full payment of the award; or, in the alternative, (ii) “another conservative rate” such as
the US prime rate plus two percentage points, which corresponds to an annualized
compound rate of 5.6% and reflects “the rate that commercial banks charge to their most

creditworthy borrowers plus a premium to reflect the fact that not all businesses can

borrow at that rate.”?!"

1746. Claimant contends that Respondent misrepresents authorities as “[n]umerous authorities”

on which Respondent relies in fact reject a risk-free rate; the tribunals in Impregilo v.
2178

Argentina and Victor Pey Casado v. Chile “adopt rates of 6% and 5% as reasonable.
By contrast, Claimant considers the risk-free rate proposed by Respondent, which
corresponds to an annualized compound rate of 0.3% and is thus considerably lower than
the US inflation rate (corresponding to an annualized compound rate of 1.5%), “plainly
unreasonable” as it would result in an award worth less on the award date, in real
inflation-adjusted terms, than on the valuation date.!” In its view, the rate proposed by
Respondent is contrary to the principle of full reparation and ignores commercial reality
as well as the risks that Claimant was forced to bear; in addition, it would ignore the two
additional functions of interest, i.e., the prevention of unjust enrichment and
efficiency.?!*°

1747.Claimant contends that adopting any rate below Pakistan’s borrowing rate would “create
the worst possible incentives in terms of both the conduct of the proceedings and the
payment of an eventual award: Pakistan would be incentivized to systematically delay
and then to withhold payment.” Claimant reiterates that, in its view, the functions of

interest can be fulfilled only if interest is awarded at a rate “at least equal to Pakistan’s

borrowing cost.”?'*!

1748. Claimant also rejects the argument that a final award would not be subject to any risk and
maintains that it was forced to bear: (i) during the pre-award period, Pakistan’s default
risk and the litigation risk; and (ii) during the post-award period, Pakistan’s default risk.
Claimant agrees that it would be “improper to compensate for the litigation risk” but
maintains that the rate it has proposed does not incorporate such risk but only reflects the

default risk which remains in the post-award period and for which Claimant should be
compensated in both periods.?!*?

1749.In response to Respondent’s reliance on the tribunal’s reasoning on Vestey v. Venezuela,
Claimant contends that the tribunal “had it backwards” because it found that the claimant
would not have borne the respondent State’s default risk in the “but for” scenario but
failed to account for the fact that, in reality, it did. Claimant further rejects the tribunal’s
reasoning that accounting for default risk would be aimed at repairing a hypothetical
breach of the ICSID Convention. Claimant maintains that it aims at “fully compensating
TCCA for the risk that it was actually forced to bear because of Pakistan’s breaches of
the Treaty.”?!8

1750. In the alternative to its primary request, Claimant submits that the Tribunal should adopt
a “commercially reasonable rate,” i.e., the U.S. prime rate plus two percentage points.,
Claimant argues that using the prime rate is a variant of the “borrowing rate” approach
based on the cost of borrowing rate of the compensated party, which was set out in the
separate opinion of Judge Holtzmann in Sylvania v. Iran, stating that it is “reasonable to

assume that most businesses habitually borrow while fewer regularly invest in certificates

of deposit.”?!*4

1751. According to Claimant, “[a] great number of tribunals” have relied on the “borrowing
rate” approach, “typically adopting rates based on the LIBOR interbank rate plus a
premium.”?'®> Claimant considers that the US prime rate would be preferable, however
“because of the announced phasing out of LIBOR and the fact that the prime rate better

reflects actual commercial borrowing rates than the interbank LIBOR rate.”?'*° It notes

that the prime rate was characterized by Judge Holtzmann as “generally representative”
of commercial borrowing rates and argues that it has “wide commercial recognition” and
has been adopted by “{n]umerous arbitral tribunals.”?'*’ In Claimant’s view, it is
necessary to add a two percentage premium to the prime rate to reflect the fact that “not

all enterprises can borrow money from the banks at the prime rate” and to achieve “a

rate that is broadly available to the market.”?'**

1752.Claimant further contends that in accordance with the principle of full reparation, interest
should be awarded on a compound basis, being the “quasi-universal norm in business,
finance, commerce, and investment law.” Quoting from Quiborax v. Bolivia, Claimant
submits that compound interest now constitutes “the standard of international law ... in

expropriation cases.” In Claimant’s view, awarding compound interest “is a matter of

realism.”?18°

1753.Claimant argues that, contrary to Respondent’s argument, Pakistani law “does not apply
and is therefore irrelevant’ because interest is due as part of the principle of full
reparation under international law. Claimant quotes from the tribunal in Quiborax v.
Bolivia, which held that “[r]eparation for expropriation is governed by international law
and full reparation includes interest for late payment. The application of national law
may be appropriate for contract claims, but not for a claim of breaches of the BIT.”
Claimant adds that even if the Tribunal were to apply Pakistani law, it should adopt the

rate of 14% that Pakistani courts “routinely” apply — which results in an annualized

compound rate of 10.5%.7!%°

1754. Claimant again contends that Respondent misrepresents authorities because “a number of
cases” relied on by Respondent in fact “explicitly endorse” compounding of interest and
the others are either irrelevant or indiosyncratic decisions based on the parties’
submissions.”!*! In Claimant’s view, the only authority supporting Respondent's position,
i.e., the statement made in the Commentary to the ILC Articles that “[t]he general view

of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest” was “doubtful

in 2001, when the ILC adopted the Articles, and it is now clearly incorrect.”?'°?

1755.Claimant acknowledges that “tribunals were historically reluctant to award compound
interest” but quotes from legal authority that the “change of trend towards accepting
compound interest became obvious in the year 2000” and that compound interest “became
the rule rather than the exception.” Claimant also refers to Dr. Ripinsky who called the

Santa Elena decision “a turning point in jurisprudence” and submits that it has now

become a “jurisprudence constante” in investment treaty arbitration.?!?*

1756. With regard to Respondent’s emphasis that the pre-award interest claimed represents
25.5% of the total amount claimed, Claimant argues that “[t]here is nothing unusual about
interest representing a significant percentage of the total sum claimed” and refers to “a

number of famous cases” in which the interest awarded even exceeded the principal

amount. According to Claimant, interest is “a crucial element of full reparation.”?!°*

2. Summary of Respondent’s Position

1757.Respondent submits that under the applicable rules of international law, any interest
awarded should be simple and accrue at a risk-free rate such as the one-month US
Treasury bills. According to Respondent, any higher rate would reward Claimant for risks

to which the assets being valued were not exposed after the valuation date or “simply
contradict the applicable law.”*!*°
1758.Respondent contends that pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Treaty, “[o]nly

commercial interest at a risk-free rate should accrue as from the valuation date.”?!°

Respondent notes that the language used in Article 7(3), i.e., “at a commercial reasonable
rate,” also appears in Article 1110(4) of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(“NAFTA”) and submits that these and similar clauses have led tribunals to effectively
award interest at a risk-free rate. Specifically, Respondent refers to the tribunal in ADM
v. Mexico which awarded “the simple interest rate for U.S. Treasury bills,” the tribunal
in SD Myers v. Canada which fixed interest at the rate applicable to the investor’s
receivables in Canadian dollars, and the tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina which
considered “the average rate of interest applicable to US six-month certificates of

deposit” appropriate.”!°’ Respondent adds that the application of US Treasury bond rates
was also endorsed by various other tribunals.?!°*

1759.Respondent also refers to sources of literature endorsed by both Parties’ experts which
state:

“At first glance, it may seem that the plaintiff is entitled to interest at its
opportunity cost of capital, r. After all, had the plaintiff received Y at time 0
[the time of the event], it would have invested the funds, receiving presumably
its average rate of return. Hence, by time t, the plaintiff would have had Yert
[i.e., Y plus compounded continuous returns at a rate equal to r during period
t], so this is the amount that would make it whole. Another version of this
argument would compensate the plaintiff at the rate it reasonably expected to
earn on the destroyed asset.

The fallacy here (in either version) has to do with risk. The plaintiff's
opportunity cost of capital includes a return that compensates the plaintiff for
the average risk it bears. But, in depriving the plaintiff of an asset worth Y at
time O, the defendant also relieved it of the risks associated with investment
in that asset. The plaintiff is thus entitled to interest compensating it for the

time value of money, but it is not also entitled to compensation for the risks it
did not bear. Hence prejudgment interest should be awarded at the risk-free
interest rate.”*!”

1760. Respondent also refers to its experts who explain in their second report that “[t]he central

point is clear: ‘The plaintiff should not be compensated (positively or negatively) for
risks he or she did not bear.”” Similarly, Mark Kantor, in his book on valuation, agrees
with this position: ‘The interest rate used for bringing historical amounts forward will
clearly not contain the same risk factors as the discount rate used to present value future
amounts. As a practical matter, the interest rate used for the historical amount is often a
‘risk-free’ rate (such as the rate for US Treasuries).’ Brattle’s choices of rates are exactly
the opposite of what economic theory dictates, and what the authors quoted above
favor.”

1761.By contrast, Respondent considers that Claimant requests “an additional outrageous

compensation of between USD 750 million and 7.5 billion as interest,” with its primary
request for interest at Pakistan’ borrowing rate amounting to over USD 2.3 billion or
25.5% of its total damages claim.?”°' According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to
provide any valid explanation as to why the Tribunal should award interest at a rate “that
accrues monies to TCC’s benefit so extraordinarily and disproportionately” instead of at
the risk-free rate, which “is the criterion favored by scholars, legal materials and a large

1762. Specifically, Respondent considers that the use of a risk-free rate such as US Treasury

bond rates is supported by the tribunals in Vestey v. Venezuela, Unglaube v. Costa Rica
and “an extensive number of other international tribunals.” It quotes from the
Unglaube tribunal which held:

“One well-recognized approach to determining the applicable interest rate
was established by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in Sylvania Technical
Systems v. Iran where it focused on developing a rate ‘based approximately
on the amount that the successful claimant would have been in the position to
have earned if it had been paid in time and thus had the funds Treaty Art.

investment in common use in its own country. Such an approach was also
adopted in Santa Elena.

The Sylvania Technical Systems tribunal ultimately decided to use the rate
from six-month United States certificates of deposit. Similarly, in other cases
such as LG&E and CMS y. Argentina, the interest rate used was that
applicable to short-term United States Treasury Bills. Both instruments have
been chosen by tribunals because they reflect conservative rates for
essentially risk-free investments. It is also worth noting that such rates have
been used in cases, like British Gas v. Argentina and Siemens v. Argentina,
which did not involve the U.S. government or U.S. companies.

Although some tribunals apply an interest rate based on the requirements of
the host State’s domestic law, this is not the prevailing practice under
internati l law. Additi: lly, c ‘s intain that, ‘[t]he host-
country-law approach has been criticized on the basis that where State's
international responsibility is engaged, the award of interest should follow
the rules of international law’ rather than domestic law. Furthermore, in
looking back to the investment alternatives approach from Sylvania Technical
Systems, it is rational to conclude that an appropriate interest rate may be
based on the ‘deposit rate... commonly used in the country of the currency in
which payment is to be made.’ Interest rates from such instruments reflect the
risk-free investments that investors were impeded from making with their
property as a result of the expropriation.”

 

1763.In Respondent’s view, it is also contradictory that Claimant claims that its investment
should be valued applying only a risk-free discount rate but then requests that additional
risks should be added to the pre-award interest rate, “the only area of the valuation for
which the prevailing literature actually considers that no risks exist.” Respondent quotes
a legal commentary stating that “[t]he interest rate used for bringing historical amounts
forward will clearly not contain the same risk factors as the discount rate used to present
value future amounts. As a practical matter, the interest rate used for the historical
amount is often a ‘risk-free’ rate (such as the rate for US Treasuries) or a statutory rate

for pre-judgment interest.””°°

1764. According to Respondent, Claimant is not exposed to any compensable risk. More
specifically, Respondent argues that “[a] final award is not subject to any type of risk.
The amount awarded is not subject to any changes, i.e. increases or reductions in
principal amount, until effective payment. None of the risk elements of an investment are

replicated in a tribunal’s determination of compensation.””°° In Respondent’s view,
Prof. Davis adopted the same opinion in Bear Creek v. Peru where he argued that “[t]he
question whether compensation for risk is appropriate, and therefore whether a spread
above the risk-free rate should be included in the pre-award interest, hinges on legal
questions of when the liability is created and whether certain risks are best characterized

as financial risks or litigation risks.”??°"

1765.Respondent argues that contrary to Prof. Davis’ description of Claimant as a “forced
creditor,” any amount of damages awarded “is not being loaned on the same risky terms
as those under which bondholders may extend credit to Pakistan” but rather “awarded
pursuant to the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.” Respondent claims that “[b]ecause
there is no risk of not collecting a valid damages award, TCC is not entitled to a rate of
interest that compensates it for both the time value of money and default risk.”
Respondent also emphasizes that Claimant did not bear the risk associated with
alternative investments and should therefore not be entitled to the returns commensurate
with those risks as it would be speculative ro assume that such returns would actually

have been earned.”?°*

1766. With regard to Prof. Davis’ calculation of pre-award interest at five different rates, i.e.:
(i) 14% flat; (ii) US prime rate + 2%, compounded; (iii) Pakistan’s short-term credit
default swap rate, compounded; (iv) US inflation rate, compounded; and (v) the risk-free
US Treasury Bill rate, not compounded that Pakistan proposed, Respondent refers to the
explanation provided by its experts that “the strategy of Brattle and Claimant appears to
be: choose rates in a way that their first choice, the credit default swaps for Pakistan, sits
in the middle of the set. For that, they selected two outrageously high rates, one that is
lower than their choice (although it is not even an interest rate), and list the rate we
propose at the bottom of the table. The message is apparently intended to be that their

rate is ‘reasonable’ or ‘conservative’, and ours is extreme.”

1767.Respondent submits that the interest rate must be determined according to the currency
of payment of the obligation, i.e. US dollars, and argues that by contrast, “Claimant’s
claim of an interest rate equal to Pakistan’s cost of borrowing would seem to indicate a
rate which is designed to apply to sums borrowed in local currency.” In Respondent’s
view, this also addresses Claimant’s argument that the risk-free rate is below the rate of
inflation because “[t]o the extent that TCC made its claim in US dollars, it is impossible

to assign hypothetical risks of inflation or devaluation of the local currency of Pakistan,
which has nothing to do with the currency in which the compensation was requested.””?!°
1768. Specifically with regard to Claimant’s argument that the risk-free rate would create the
wrong incentives, Respondent quotes from the tribunal in Vestey v. Venezuela, which held
that the “Tribunal does not find it appropriate for it to assume by anticipation that a
sovereign state will breach a treaty obligation. Having said this, even if the assumption
were made, it would in any event not justify an interest rate incorporating the risk of
defaulting on the payment of the award. Indeed, accounting for this risk would mean
seeking to repair a (hypothetical) breach of the ICSID Convention when this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction is limited to breaches of the BIT.”??'' Respondent argues that “the Tribunal
cannot prejudge or even assume that Pakistan will not fulfill its duty to pay an obligation”
and rejects the suggestion that to award interest at a rate lower than Pakistan’s borrowing
rate would incentivize it to violate international investment treaties or to delay the
resolution of investment disputes.??!?

1769. Respondent also refers to the holding of the Vestey tribunal:

“The function of reparation is to compensate the victim for its actual losses.
It is not to reward it for risks which it does not bear. As the Claimant itself
argues, the award should reestablish the situation which would in all
probability have existed but for the wrongful measures. As the Parties agree
on the Valuation Date, the ‘but for’ scenario involves placing [the claimant
party] in the position in which it would have been if it had received
compensation on that date. In that case, [that claimant] would have been able
to make use of the funds received as compensation. At no point in that
scenario would [that claimant] have borne the risk of [the respondent State]’s
sovereign default. The Claimant argues that ‘[a]n award of interest at a rate
lower than the state's borrowing cost would create an incentive for states to
‘refinance' fiscal obligations by withholding comy ion for internationally
wrongful acts’. However, reparation focuses on making the victim whole; it
is not concerned with the possible enrichment of the Respondent. As the SPP
tribunal stressed, ‘the measure of compensation should reflect the claimant's
loss rather than the defendant's gain.””??"

 

 

1770. Also referring to the tribunal in Siag v. Vecchi, which held that the relief to be awarded
to claimant is purely compensatory, Respondent argues that the appropriate rate must only

reflect the time value of money and be equal to an interest rate applicable for lending to
a borrower at no default risk.7?!4

1771. With regard to Claimant’s claim for an award of compound interest, Respondent further
contends that, contrary to Claimant’s assertion, “multiple tribunals continue to apply
simple interest, as they should.” It agrees with Claimant’ s statement that “tribunals were
historically reluctant to award compound interest” and maintains that “that current did
not change in investment arbitration.”??!> Respondent refers to the Commentary to the
ILC Articles, which noted that “[t]he general view of courts and tribunals has been
against the award of compound interest, and this is true even of those tribunals which
hold claimants to be normally entitled to compensatory interest.’ The Commentary
referred in particular to decisions rendered by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, which “has
consistently denied claims for compound interest,’ and concluded that “[t]he
preponderance of authority thus continues to support the view expressed by Arbitrator
Huber in the British Claims in the Spanish Zone of Morocco case: the arbitral case law
in matters involving compensation of one State for another for damages suffered by the
nationals of one within the territory of the other ... is unanimous ... in disallowing
compound interest. In these circumstances, very strong and quite specific arguments

would be called for to grant such interest.”??'°

1772.On that basis, Respondent contends that “only exceptional circumstances” justify a

departure from the general rule to award simple interest. According to Respondent, this

rule is confirmed by “decisions new and old.”?"”

1773.In any event, Respondent emphasizes that under Pakistani law, which is relevant “on the
face of the mandate under Art. 42.1 of the ICSID Convention,” the application of
compound interest is forbidden in the absence of a specific agreement to that effect.
According to Respondent, the Treaty cannot be interpretated to “obliterate that legal
prohibition,” which would contradict the object and purpose of the Treaty, and in any
event, “a compound rate which contradicted Pakistani law would not by any length

constitute a ‘commercially reasonable rate’ under Art. 7.3 of the BIT.””?'® According to

Respondent, the prohibition of compound interest under local law also led to the rejection
of such a request in Duke Energy v. Ecuador and Desert Line v. Yemen.??'?

1774. Respondent submits that the legality of compound interest in Pakistan is regulated in the
Code of Civil Procedure of 1908, the Arbitration Act of 1940 and the Land Acquisition
Act of 1894. According to Respondent, these rules as they have been interpreted by

Pakistani courts render it “impossible to applying compound interest absent an agreement
by the parties,” leaving simple interest as “the only possible result.”???°

1775.Specifically, Respondent refers to Section 34 of the Civil Code of Procedure which is
concerned with interest payable from the date of the suit to the date of the decree as well
as after the date of the decree and provides:

“34. Interest. (1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money,
the Court may, in the decree, order interest at such rate as the Court deems
reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the suit
to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such
principal sum for any period prior to the institution of the suit, with further
interest at such rate as the Court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so
adjudged, from the date of the decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier
date as the Court thinks fit. 2) Where such a decree is silent with respect to
the payment of further interest on such aggregate sum as aforesaid from the
date of the decree to the date of payment or other earlier date, the Court shall
be deemed to have refused such interest, and a separate suit therefore shall
not lie.””??!

1776.Respondent argues that while Pakistani courts have “on occasion” upheld agreements
providing for compound interest, such authoritry requires an express agreement between
the parties. In the absence of such an agreement between the Parties in this case,

Respondent maintains that the Tribunal must reject Claimant’s request for an award of

compound interest.????

1777.Consequently, Respondent submits that any interest awarded should accrue as simple

interest based on the yield of the one-month US Treasury bill.???*

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

1778. At the outset of its analysis on interest, the Tribunal notes that while Claimant relies on
the principle of full reparation as the applicable standard of compensation, Respondent
refers to the expropriation provision of the Treaty and, in the context of interest,
specifically to Article 7(3). In its analysis of the legal standards governing Claimant’s
claim for compensation, the Tribunal has determined that if the market value of
Claimant’s investment can be “readily ascertained” based on the evidence and valuation
methods before it, there is no need to decide whether this result is based on the
compensation provision in Article 7(2) of the Treaty or a compensation standard under
customary international law. As set out in detail above, the Tribunal has determined the
market value of Claimant’s investment based on the modern DCF valuation method
applied by Prof. Davis. Consequently, the Tribunal did not have to make a conclusive
finding on the applicable standard of compensation.

1779. As for the standard to determine the applicable interest rate, Respondent relies on Article
7(3) of the Treaty, which provides with regard to interest:
“The compensation ... shall include interest at a commercially reasonable
rate from the date the measures were taken to the date of payment ...”??>4
1780.Claimant refers to the principle of full reparation under customary international law. As
both Parties have referred to the Commentary to Article 38 of the ILC Articles in the
context of their submissions on interest, this provision may also be quoted as reflective
of the standard under customary international law:
“7. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable

when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode
of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.

2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid
until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.”®?”>
1781.While the Parties are in dispute as to the applicable standard of compensation, there is
common ground with regard to interest to the extent that: (i) Claimant is entitled to
payment of interest from the date of Respondent’s Treaty breaches until the date of
payment of the award, i.e., pre-award and post award interest; and (ii) interest has a
compensatory function, i.e., it is aimed at complementing the amount of compensation to
which Claimant is entitled for the losses it has incurred as a result of Respondent’s
breaches. Respondent explicitly confirms that “the appropriate interest rate must be

determined only with a view to appropriately compensate the creditor.”???6 Claimant also

confirms that “[t]he compensatory function is the primary function of interest at

international law.”???7

1782.Claimant further refers to a “wide margin of discretion in awarding interest” and argues
that two additional functions of interest should inform the Tribunal’s discretion, i.e., the
aim “to prevent unjust enrichment of the respondent at the expense of the claimant” and
“to promote efficiency.”*?> The Tribunal does not consider it established, however, that
the interest rate is the proper means to address either of these considerations.

1783.The Tribunal recalls that the entire exercise of valuating Claimant’s investment has been
aimed at determining the amount of compensation that corresponds to the damage that
Claimant has incurred as a result of Respondent’s Treaty breaches. This assessment did
not look at a possible enrichment from which Pakistan may have benefitted as a result of
these same actions but only at the damage incurred by Claimant which has to be
compensated. In the Tribunal’s view, it would be inconsistent if a different perspective
were to be taken to determine the applicable interest rate. In this regard, the Tribunal
agrees with the tribunal in Vestey v. Venezuela, which held that “reparation focuses on
making the victim whole; it is not concerned with the possible enrichment of the
Respondent. As the SPP tribunal stressed, ‘the measure of compensation should reflect

the claimant's loss rather than the defendant's gain.’”?22°

1784. Given the Parties’ agreement on the compensatory function of interest under both of the
standards of compensation on which they have relied, the Tribunal believes that in the
present case, it is not necessary to make a conclusive finding on the applicable standard
of compensation because it is possible to determine an interest rate that is both
“commercially reasonable” as required by Article 7(3) of the Treaty and ensures full
reparation of the damage that Claimant has incurred as a result of Respondent’s breaches
as required under customary international law.

1785.The Tribunal notes that with regard to the appropriate interest rate, neither Party has
argued that a distinction should be drawn between pre-award and post-award interest.
Consequently, the Tribunal will determine a uniform interest rate which applies from the
date of Respondent’s Treaty breaches, i.e., 15 November 2011, until the date on which
Claimant receives payment of the amount of compensation that Respondent is ordered to
pay to it pursuant to this Award.

1787.Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells criticized this table as being part of an attempt to show
the reasonableness of the rate proposed by Claimant by selecting “two outrageously high
rates, one that is lower than their choice (although it is not even an interest rate), and list
the rate we propose at the bottom of the table” in order to show that the rate proposed by
Respondent’s experts was “extreme.” They also argued that “no explanation is given as
to why they decided to present these rates and not others” and maintained that “the only
rate that has a solid economic justification is the last one, insofar as it contains no element
of risk and is the one recommended by authorities.”??3! Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells
did not, however, dispute the calculation made by Prof. Davis on the basis of the rates
presented in the table above, neither with regard to the annualized compound rate to which
each rate would correspond, nor the amount of pre-award interest by which Claimant’s
compensation would, respectively, increase.

1788. Consequently, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to refer to the results presented in
lines [1] to [3] of this table to discuss the proposals made by the Parties and their experts.
As for line [4], Claimant does not contend that the US inflation rate is an interest rate but
has rather presented this rate in support of its argument that the rate proposed by
Respondent is significantly below the rate of inflation in the United States. As for line
[5], labelled “Pakistan simple interest at 14%,” Claimant does not actually request that
this rate be applied in the present case but has rather referred to it in response to
Respondent’s reliance on Pakistani law with regard to the question of compound interest.
As will be discussed in more detail below, the Tribunal is of the view that the interest rate

applicable to Claimant’s compensation for losses incurred as a result of Respondent’s
breaches of the Treaty must be determined on the basis of international law and not
domestic Pakistani law. For this reason, the Tribunal will not refer any further to the
interest rate in line [5].

1789.The Tribunal notes that a considerable part of both Parties’ submissions on interest
concerns the question whether Claimant bears, and should thus be compensated for, the
risk of Pakistan’s default as a result of the fact that Claimant has not received the amount
of compensation on 15 November 2011 but will receive payment only at a future point in
time after this Award. While Claimant argues that its position is that of a “forced” creditor
and that it has borne and continues to bear Pakistan’s default risk just like other creditors
of the State,??>? Respondent claims that “there is no risk of not collecting a valid damages

award” rendered pursuant to the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.??°

1790.In the Tribunal’s view, it is not necessary in the present case to express a conclusive
opinion on this point. The Tribunal has already determined above that interest has
compensatory function, i.e., it serves to complement the compensation to which Claimant
is entitled for the losses it has incurred as a result of Respondent’s Treaty breaches. The
relevant question is thus whether and in what amount Claimant would likely have
achieved a return on the amount of compenssation if it had received such amount on
15 November 2011. As will be set out in more detail below, the Tribunal considers that
this compensatory function, which applies under both compensation standards relied on
by the Parties, is fulfilled by awarding interest at a rate that serves as a proxy for the
borrowing costs of Claimant’s owners. While an argument could be made that the interest
rate should in any event not fall below Pakistan’s borrowing rate, this question does not
arise in the present case because the rate that the Tribunal determines to be applicable
below exceeds Pakistan’s borrowing rate. Consequently, Claimant’s arguments that
Respondent would lack an incentive to pay the award and that Claimant should be
compensated for having to bear Pakistan’s default risk until payment is made can be
considered moot.

1791.As to the applicable compensatory considerations, it appears to be undisputed between
the Parties and their experts that it would not be appropriate to award interest at a rate of
return that Claimant might have been able to achieve if it had invested the amount, most
likely in the mining business, because that investment would have been associated with
risks that Claimant did not actually bear. Prof. Davis specifically stated in his second
report that he “did not calculate interest at Claimant’s opportunity cost of capital and did

publication relied on by Respondent’s experts] argue would inappropriately compensate
Claimant for a risk it did not bear.”?** At the Hearing on Quantum, Prof. Wells
emphasized in response to the question whether the cost of capital or average rate of return
would be the relevant benchmark that “[i]f you invest it in something that you think is
going to yield a higher Rate of Return, that's because there is risk attached to it. There is

no risk attached to the money for the Award.”

1792.In accordance with the agreement between the experts, the Tribunal will therefore not aim
at determining an interest rate reflecting Claimant’s cost of capital or the average rate of
return that it might have achieved. However, the fact remains that Claimant is entitled to
compensation for the expropriation and other Treaty breaches that have occurred on 15
November 2011. While it may be speculative to make assumptions as to the returns that
Claimant or its owners might have achieved by investing this amount and the risk that
would have been associated with such an alternative investment, the Tribunal considers
it sufficiently likely and in line with basic economic considerations that Claimant or its
owners would have put this money to use for the business they are involved in. Given the
undisputed opportunities to achieve high returns in the mining business and the
undisputed risks associated with these opportunities, the Tribunal is not convinced that
the application of a risk-free rate, as an approximation of the returns that Claimant could
have made from making a risk-free investment, would adequately capture the damage
that Claimant has incurred. In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that the amount of
compensation was not available to Claimant and its owners as of November 2011 can
rather be considered captured in their own borrowing costs, i.e., the cost for having to
borrow the amount of money that should have been, but was not, made available to
Claimant in November 2011. In this case, the Tribunal considers that the relevant
borrowing costs are those of Antofagasta and Barrick, i.e., the companies which had
undisputedly paid for the exploration work and (pre-)feasibility studies and which would
have contributed the required amounts of equity into the project if it had proceeded to the
construction and mining operations stage.

1793.As pointed out by Claimant, the “borrowing rate” approach was put forward by Judge
Holtzmann in his Separate Opinion in Sylvania Technical Systems v. Iran. While the
majority of the tribunal had found that the interest rate should be “based approximately
on the amount that the successful claimant would have been in a position to have earned
if it had been paid in time and thus had the funds available to invest in a form of
commercial investment in common use in its own country” and concluded that the six-
month certificates of deposit in the United States represented such a form of

investment,??*° Judge Holtzmann “believe[d] that using the average rate paid on six-
month certificates of deposit in the United States is not unreasonable, but that it would
be more appropriate to base the Tribunals interest rate on the prime rate during the
relevant period. In his view, it is reasonable to assume that most businesses habitually
borrow while fewer regularly invest in certificates of deposit. Moreover, although the
prime rate is not applicable to all businesses, it is generally representative because the
difference between it and other lending rates is relatively small. In contrast, the six-month
deposit rate is less representative because of the wide range of possible uses that
businesses make of their funds and the relatively large differences in the rates of return

on such uses.”??>7

1794. As pointed out in an authority addressing the calculation of compensation and damages
in international investment law on which Claimant has also relied in the context of
interest, the use of the borrowing rate of the claimant as a reference rate for pre-award
interest is also reflected in international codifications of contract law such as the the
Principle of European Contract Law and the UNIDROIT Principles on International
Commercial Contracts. She explained that the prime rate to which these provisions
referred “represents the interest rate that commercial banks charge their most
creditworthy borrowers, such as large corporations,” noting that “[o]nly a few businesses
qualify for the prime rate.” She noted that Judge Holtzmann and other decisions of the
Iran-US Claims Tribunal usually referred to the US prime rate and identified further
investment decisions in which tribunals had applied the US or New York prime rate, in
two cases wth a premium of two and three percentage points, respectively, and in other
cases with no additional premium.??** She added:

“The ‘prime’ or ‘base’ rate plays an important role in negotiations about
company loan conditios in Anglo-American countries. As such, it seems to be
an appropriate basis for the assessment of the damages incurred by delayed
payment. However, it must be taken into account that not all enterprises can
borrow money from the banks at the prime rate so that an increase by a few
percentage points might be necessary. The question then arises, how many
percentage points are appropriate. The practice of tribunals in not entirely
consistent, but the variations remain rather limited. In addition, the prime
rate as such fluctuates less than other commercial benchmarks, for example,

the LIBOR. These advantages add to the conceptual logic of the application
of the prime rate as a proxy for the borrowing rate of the investor”???

1795.The same authority also stated that “one could also think of applying the actual borrowing
rate of the investor’ but noted that “[i]t appears, however, very difficult to identify the
borrowing rate of the investor” and presented possible means of achieving an estimation

of that acutal borrowing rate.?*4?

1796. The Tribunal notes that it has not been provided with the borrowing rate, or an estimation
of such rate, for either Antofagasta or Barrick. The Tribunal therefore considers it
appropriate to apply, as the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and several investment treaty
tribunals have done, a reasonable approximation of such a borrowing rate. Claimant
argues that in that case, the Tribunal should apply the US Prime Rate plus two percentage
points, referring to the fact that “not all enterprises can borrow money from banks at the
prime rate” and an aim to achieve “a rate that is broadly available to the market.” It
further argues that the addition of that premium is “especially important ‘[i]n the present

market situation of ultra-low interest rates.””?74!

1797.In the Tribunal’s view, however, the decisive question is not whether the interest rate
would be “broadly available to the market” but rather whether it reasonably reflects the
borrowing costs of Claimant’s owners which would have funded the project and, thus,
the damage caused by the fact that the owed amount of compensation has not been paid
on 15 November 2011. Given that Barrick and Antofagasta are undisputedly large and
creditworthy companies — a fact which has played a role in various aspects of the
Tribunal’s assessment of the concerns raised by Respondent regarding the alleged
unfeasibility of the project — the Tribunal is not convinced that the addition of two
percentage points would be appropriate in the present circumstances.

1798. The Tribunal also cannot follow the argument that “the present market situation of ultra-
low interest rates” would warrant a different result. As calculated by Prof. Davis, the US
Prime Rate plus two percentage points corresponds to an annualized compound rate of
5.6%. This indicates that the US Prime Rate as such is not “ultra low.” In any event, the
statement quoted by Claimant was made by tribunal in Rusoro v. Venezuela in the context
of assessing a four percent premium to the LIBOR rate, which is not at issue here, and
together with its finding that the interest rate should not fall below a minmum of 4%
p.a.>? In the Tribunal’s view, this indicates that the base rate considered by the Rusoro

tribunal was below zero at certain times and is thus not comparable to the base rate at
issue in this case.

1799. At the same time, the Tribunal is also not convinced that interest at the US Prime Rate
with no additional premium is sufficient to compensate Claimant for the damage it has
incurred as a result of Respondent’s Treaty breaches. On balance, the Tribunal therefore
concludes that interest should accrue at the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point,
corresponding to a reasonable approximation of the borrowing cost of Claimant’s owners
and thus the damage that Claimant has incurred as a result of Respondent’s Treaty
breaches and the fact that compensation will be paid only after this Award.

1800.In the Tribunal’s view, this rate is consistent with both standards of compensation
advanced by the Parties, i.e., it corresponds to a “commercially reasonable” rate as
required under Article 7(3) of the Treaty and it ensures full reparation as required under
customary international law.

1801.The final question for the Tribunal to assess is therefore whether interest should be
calculated on a compound or simple basis.

1802. One of the arguments put forward by Respondent is that under Pakistani law, compound
interest is prohibited in the absence of a specific agreement to that effect. It argues that
“any interpretation that the Australia-Pakistan BIT would lend itself to interpretations
that would obliterate that legal prohibition would contradict the object and purpose of
the BIT, and should thus be abandoned.’ The Tribunal is not convinced by this
argument, however. It is undisputed between the Parties that the present dispute arises
under international law and is to be decided pursuant to the rules of international law, in
particular the provisions of the Treaty. The Tribunal also notes that in the context of its
submissions on the applicable interest rate, Respondent itself relies on a quote from the
reasoning of the tribunal in Unglaube v. Costa Rica, which stated, inter alia, that
“Tallthough some tribunals apply an interest rate based on the requirements of the host
State’s domestic law, this is not the prevailing practice under international law.
Additionally, commentators maintain that, ‘[t]he host-country-law approach has been
criticized on the basis that where State’s international responsibility is engaged, the award
of interest should follow the rules of international law’ rather than domestic law.” It
might be worth noting that the commentator from whose book on damages in
international law the Unglaube tribunal quoted is Dr. Ripinsky, who appeared as legal
expert for Respondent in this arbitration. Dr. Ripinsky did not express an opinion on
interest in either of his legal opinions.

1803.The Tribunal also notes that Respondent itself has not proposed the application of an

interest rate applicable under Pakistani law but has rather based its proposal of a risk-free
rate based on US Treasury bills on considerations and authorities of international law. In
the Tribunal’s view, it would be inconsistent, however, to then resort to Pakistani law in
order to determine whether that interest, which undisputedly had to be determined in
accordance with the rules and principles of international law, shall be calculated on a
compound or simple basis. The Tribunal will therefore look to international law to resolve
this question as well.

1804.There is common ground between the Parties to the extent that in earlier decisions,

tribunals tended to reject requests for compound interest. Claimant acknowledges that
“tribunals were historically reluctant to award compound interest.””>*> As pointed out by
Respondent, the Commentary to Article 38 of the ILC Articles, which dates from 2001,
noted that “[t]he general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of
compound interest, and this is true even of those tribunals which hold claimants to be
normally entitled to compensatory interest.”?>*° The Commentary specifically referred to
decisions rendered by Iran-US Claims Tribunal in 1984 and 1986, which held that
“special reasons” were required to depart from “international precedents which normally
do not allow the awarding of compound interest” and which, according to Commentary
demonstrated that “[t]he preponderance of authority thus continues to support the view
expressed by Arbitrator Huber in the British Claims in the Spanish Zone of Morocco
case,” which took place from 1923 to 1925 and in which he held that “the arbitral case

law ... is unanimous ... in disallowing compound interest.”?*7

1805. The Parties are in dispute, however, as to whether there has been a change in more recent

case law reflecting a trend towards granting compound interest as part of the
compensation awarded to investors. As pointed out by Claimant, Dr. Ripinsky stated in
his book on damages in international investment law dating from 2008:

“The practice of investment tribunals has been mixed. However—perhaps a
positive response to the academic criticism of simple interest—in the last 10
years tribunals have predominantly awarded compound interest. There have
been more than 15 publicly known awards rendered by international
tribunals in investor-State disputes where compound interest was granted,
most of them issued after 2000. Although it would be wrong to suggest that
tribunals have stopped awarding simple interest, the preference for
compound interest has become apparent.”?>48

1806. Following a discussion of the case law rendered in and after 2000, in particular the
tribunal’s reasoning in Santa Elena v. Costa Rica which awarded compound interest in
2000 and which he described as “a turning point in jurisprudence,” Dr. Ripinsky also
made express reference to the ILC Articles quoted above and noted that while this
codification of the international law on State responsibility “continues to treat simple
interest as the norm, viewing compound interest as exceptional and to be awarded only
where special circumstances warrant it in order to achieve full reparation,””> a different
trend could be seen in international investment law:

“As far as international investment law is concerned, there has been a
reversal of the presumption of simple interest: a significant number of recent
tribunal decisions provide a strong indication that compound interest has
come to be treated as the default solution. This may be due to the nature of
economic activity of the claimants in investor-State disputes and strong
theoretical support for granting compound interest in such cases.”??°°

1807.The trend described by Dr. Ripinsky in 2008 and specifically that “[a] real change of
trend towards accepting compound interest became obvious in the year 2000,” starting
with the Santa Elena decision, was confirmed by the authority relied on by Claimant,
which discusses the calculation of compensation and damages in international investment
law and is dated 2017.25! Following an overview on relevant case law, including more
recent case law rendered after 2008, this authority also concluded that “[t]he brief
overview shows that compound interest as opposed to simple interest is predominantly
accepted in recent international investment arbitration. It is regarded as better reflecting
actual economic realities both for the purpose of remedying the loss actually incurred by
the injured party and for the prevention of unjustified enrichment of the respondent

state.”2252

1808. While the Tribunal has determined above that it does not consider it appropriate to mix
considerations of unjust enrichment with the determination of damages based on
compensatory principles, the Tribunal agrees with the authorities quoted above as well as
with the tribunals whose decisions they discussed that compound interest more
adequately reflects economic reality and thus the loss that Claimant has in fact incurred
as a result of Respondent’s Treaty breaches.

1809.Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant is entitled to interest at a rate
corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage point, compounded annually,

Specifically, Respondent shall pay to Claimant interest at the rate specified above: (i),

VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON COSTS

1810.On 28 September 2018, both Parties submitted their statements of costs, reflecting the
costs, fees and expenses they incurred in this arbitration.

1811.Pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the decision on the costs of the
arbitration, i.e., the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings
as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, shall form part of the
award.

1812. Accordingly, the Tribunal has not yet rendered a decision on the costs incurred by the
Parties in the first phase of the proceedings leading up to the Tribunal’s Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability and the second phase leading up to the Tribunal’s Decision on
Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims. In both Decisions, it has reserved on
the costs of the respective phase of the arbitration for this Award.

A. Claimant’s Submission on Costs

1813.Claimant submits that the Tribunal should order Respondent to compensate Claimant for
all of the costs it has incurred in connection with this arbitration, including arbitral costs,
legal fees and expenses, on an indemnity basis, in order to restore Claimant to the position

it would have been in but for Respondent’s Treaty breaches.??>3

1814.Claimant argues that this should follow not only from the general principle that it has
prevailed on all of its claims but also from the fact that, according to Claimant,
Respondent “has gone to great length to frustrate TCCA’s claims” and “to erect every
conceivable obstacle to TCCA’s efforts to obtain compensation” in order to delay an

award and increase Claimant’s costs.77*4

1815.Claimant points to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and notes that tribunals have
consistently held that this provision affords them wide discretion to assess costs as they
see fit, as has also been acknowledged by Respondent. Claimant considers it agreed

between the Parties that “the Tribunal should consider the relative success of the Parties
in pursuing their claims and defenses, as well as the conduct of the Parties in advancing

those claims and defenses.” In Claimant’s view, both aspects require that it be awarded
255

  

all of its costs.

1816. Referring to the general principle in international arbitral practice that costs should follow

the event, Claimant considers that its application must result in Respondent bearing
Claimant’s costs because Claimant prevailed on “virtually all legal and evidentiary issues
considered by the Tribunal,” in particular: (i) jurisdiction and admissibility; (ii) liability;
(iii) Respondent’s counterclaim; (iv) Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims;
(v) Respondent’s Reconsideration Request; (vi) Respondent’s first Disqualification
Request; (vii) Respondent’s second Disqualification Proposal; and (viii) Respondent’s

Application for a Ruling in Limine and for Spoliation Sanctions.”?°°

1817.According to Claimant, it should be awarded all of its costs and expenses even if the

Tribunal were to award it a lesser amount than sought as damages in the present phase.
Claimant refers to the tribunal in Bear Creek v. Peru, which awarded the claimant only
3% of the requested amount but 75% of its costs, because it did not consider it relevant
which proportion of damages was ultimately awarded but what caused the party to incur
the costs for which it sought reimbursement and noted that “[t]he vast majority of the
arbitration costs were caused by the issues on which Respondent did not prevail.” In

Claimant’s view, the same applies in the present case.?7>7

1818.Claimant further argues that awarding its full costs and expenses is consistent with, and

2255

in fact required under, the customary international law standard of full reparation. It refers
to the tribunal in Gemplus v. Mexico, which held that “following the general principle
expressed in Chorzow Factory, that ‘reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act’, ... compensation should include a claimant’s reasonable
costs, both reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, in successfully and
necessarily asserting its disputed legal rights in arbitration proceedings against an
unsuccessful respondent,” as well as to the tribunal in ADC v. Hungary, which considered
that ““[w]ere the Claimants not to be reimbursed their costs in justifying what they

alleged to be egregious conduct on the part of Hungary it could not be said that they were

being made whole.”??*

1819. As an additional factor, Claimant considers it well-established that a tribunal “should ...
take into account the procedural conduct of the parties, and in particular whether such
conduct delayed the proceedings or increased costs unnecessarily” and claims that
Respondent’s conduct has caused both, i.e., significant delays and unnecessary costs,

through the manner in which it chose to argue its case.???

1820.Claimant further contends that a cost award serves not only to compensate the injured
party but also to sanction unlawful, dilatory or other improper conduct of the wrongful
party. It specifically refers to the tribunal in Karkey v. Pakistan, which held that “Pakistan
did not cooperate in good faith in the arbitral proceedings and such behaviour must be
taken into account by the Tribunal in the allocation of costs” and placed emphasis on the
fact that Pakistan “made the Tribunal spend a large part of the Hearing on unfounded ...
arguments of corruption” and that “Pakistan requested the introduction of additional
evidence only at the end of the[{] proceedings causing unnecessary disruption and
expenses, in an attempt to uncover evidence to substantiate alleged ‘red flags’ or

suspicions of corruption.”?2

1821.Claimant argues that, likewise, Respondent’s “improper conduct” in this case increased
the duration and costs of this arbitration and also threatened the integrity of the
proceedings, providing “further and independent reason’ to award Claimant all of its
costs and expenses. Specifically, Claimant refers to the following “examples”: (i)
Balochistan’s reversal of its position in the Supreme Court proceedings regarding the
CHEJVA; (ii) Respondent’s “abusive extension demands” with regard to its Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, which forced the Tribunal to postpone the

 

Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability by ten months; (iii) Respondent’s corruption claims
which it raised in a letter eight months after the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability and
which it continued to expand after its Application to Dimiss the Claims, especially
through new and expanded witness statements; (iv) Respondent’s reliance on “false
confessions and fabricated documentary evidence” in support of its allegations which
were “deliberately designed to be difficult to disprove” and caused Claimant to incur more

than USD 25 million in costs to investigate and defend against these allegations; (v)

Respondent’s demand for a separate hearing dedicated to hearing the Parties’ forensic

Respondent’s second Disqualification Proposal which was directed against all three

Council; (vii) Respondent’s conduct in connection with the 2017 site visit which caused
Claimant to incur more than USD 120,000 in direct expenses as well as “hundreds of
thousands of dollars of additional legal fees and costs in defending against the procedural
applications Pakistan filed arising out of that visit,” in particular regarding the review of
Claimant’s records at the offices of its Pakistani counsel; (viii) Respondent sought to
introduce new witness evidence during the second round of written submissions in every
phase of the arbitration; (ix) Respondent “willfully” failed to produce documents despite
repeated orders from the Tribunal and redacted several documents despite the Tribunal’ s
orders; and (x) in the quantum phase, Respondent submitted a valuation that its own
expert acknowledged to be contrary to industry practice and launched “unfounded
attacks” against the Feasibility study and Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study the defense

against which caused more than USD 1.2 million in expert witness fees and expenses.””°!

1822.Finally, Claimant submits that in the circumstances of this arbitration, the costs it has
incurred are “entirely reasonable” because “the manner in which Pakistan has chosen to
defend itself was enormously expensive for TCCA.” In particular, Claimant argues that
any disparity between the cost incurred by the Parties is “the inescapable consequence of
Pakistan’s frivolous claims.” It refers to several tribunals, which held that it is not
unreasonable for claimants to incur greater costs than respondents as they bear the burden
of proof on most issues. In addition, Claimant argues that there is a “massive disparity in
the Parties’ respective disclosures of documents and the fact that TCCA had not only to
investigate a wide range of vague and unfounded allegations of corruption but defend
against scattershot attacks on virtually every aspect of its exploration and feasibility
work” and further points to “Pakistan’s consistent practice of introducing new claims and

evidence on reply or rejoinder, and to file frivolous procedural applications.”

1823.In any event, Claimant submits that tribunals have been reluctant to “second-guess” a
party’s decision to incur each component cost and refers to Judge Holtzmann quoted in
ADC v. Hungary, who considered that “legal bills are usually first submitted to
businessmen. The pragmatic fact that a businessman has agreed to pay a bill, not knowing
whether or not the Tribunal would reimburse the expenses, is a strong indication that the

B. _Respondent’s Submission on Costs

1825. Respondent submits that Claimant should bear all costs and fees incurred by Respondent
or, in the alternative, the Tribunal should allocate costs based on the proportion of success

of Claimant’s damages claim.??°°

1826. Respondent submits that pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal
has the power and discretion to determine and allocate the costs of this arbitration and
argues that ICSID tribunals award costs against the other party “where that party has

2266 According to Respondent,

acted in an unreasonable, unlawful, or frivolous manner.
Claimant’s actions “have demonstrated bad faith tactics, frivolous objections, and
unlawful actions, particularly as it relates to Pakistan’s access to the project records and
the site visit to the core shed” which Claimant attempted to avoid and restrict. Respondent
claims that Claimant employed “guerilla tactics” before and during the site visit and even
compromised the integrity of the project’s physical records by paying a witness to remove
samples from the core shed, demonstrating Claimant’s bad faith. By contrast, Respondent
argues that it acted “in an abundance of good faith,’ facilitating the site visit and ensuring
the safety of Claimant’s personnel.??67

1827.Respondent further argues that Claimant filed “frivolous requests for interim relief”
before this Tribunal as well as the parallel tribunal in the ICC proceedings between
Claimant and the Province of Balochistan, with the first of them being dismissed by both
Tribunals and the second one being abandoned even though the court proceedings before
the Islamabad High Court continue. Respondent also refers to Claimant’s submission of
almost 70 new documents “on the eve of the hearing” even though they were mostly
supportive of issues raised in its Quantum Reply and/or should have been disclosed
pursuant to Respondent’s document production requests. According to Respondent, “even
more shocking” was that Claimant disclosed only a few days before the closing arguments
that the calculation of its expert had been “off by USD 1 billion,” which required
Respondent to restructure its cross-examination and its experts to conduct a rushed review
of these calculations. In Respondent’s view, “[t]his error cannot go unnoticed and should

be given due consideration in any costs determination.”

1828.As for Claimant’s complaint about delays caused by Respondent in this arbitration,
Respondent argues that an award of interest will compensate for the passage of time and
emphasizes that “any delay caused was necessary for Pakistan to fully exercise and
protect its due process rights and do as much as possible to ensure a fair proceeding and
maintain the equality of arms between the parties. Pakistan has otherwise acted
appropriately in these proceedings. None of the objections or defenses raised by Pakistan
were frivolous or offered in bad faith, but to the contrary were serious, based on solid

grounds, and put forth to fully guard and defend Pakistan’s rights.”

1829. Specifically, Respondent contends that its corruption allegations were based on newly
discovered evidence “that could not be ignored” and brought to light Claimant’s
engagement in improper payments to obtain visa approvals and the violation of anti-
corruption policies by the all-expense trips for the GOB. Respondent also emphasizes that
its first Disqualification Request was filed to defend its right to an impartial and
independent tribunal and that its second Disqualification Proposal was based on newly
discovered facts. According to Respondent, “Pakistan should not be penalized for
exercising its rights to ensure the integrity of the proceedings and the impartiality of the
Tribunal.”

1830.Respondent therefore requests that the allocation of costs take into account “TCCA’s
tactics to derail and prejudice Pakistan’s defense” and ultimately be based on the
apportionment of success of the damages that Claimant has claimed in order to “balance
against the current trend of claimants abusing the ICSID system to request exorbitant
damages, which they are not able to prove, as a ruse to get the Tribunal to issue higher

damage awards.” According to Respondent, Claimant has advanced an “unsubstantiated
and outrageous damages claim against a developing State that has to struggle to find the
resources to mount a meaningful defense.” For that reason, Respondent argues that costs
should not be awarded exclusively on the basis of who prevailed in a given phase of the
proceedings but should rather also consider the overall success of Claimant’s damages
claim in order to discourage claimants from seeking “exaggerated and deceptive damages

claims,” while preserving the integrity and respectability of the ICSID system.”””!

1831.Respondent requests that the Tribunal award costs to Pakistan or, in the alternative,
allocate costs based on the success of Claimant’s damages claim, and submits that it has
incurred costs in the total amount of USD 25,456,790, which it has summarized as

Tribunal’s Decision

1832.There is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal’s authority to render a

decision on the allocation of costs is based on Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention,
which provides:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such
decision shall form part of the Award.”

1833.There is further common ground that the Tribunal enjoys discretion to “assess the

expenses incurred by the parties,” which extends to all costs incurred by the Parties in
connection with this arbitration, i.e., including legal and expert fees and expenses as well
as other expenses.

1834. The Tribunal will thus exercise its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention

1.

and decide on the allocation of: (i) the costs of the arbitration, which includes the
administrative fees charged by ICSID as well as the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal; and (ii) the fees and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this
arbitration.

The Costs of the Arbitration

1835. First, the Tribunal will address the question of who shall bear the costs of the arbitration.

1836.There is common ground between the Parties to the extent that in its decision on the

allocation of costs, the Tribunal should take into account the outcome of the arbitration.
While Claimant explicitly refers to the principle of “costs follow the event” and places
emphasis on the legal and evidentiary issues on which it has prevailed in the course of
this arbitration, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should not only look at who
prevailed in a given phase of the arbitration but also take into account the overall success
of Claimant’s damages claim, i.e., the proportion of success specifically in the quantum
phase.

1837. The Tribunal does not agree with the overarching significance that Respondents intends

273,

to attach to the result of this final phase of the proceedings. In support of its argument,
Respondent invokes the necessity to discourage claimants from filing exaggerated
damages claims and preserving the integrity of the ICSID system. The Tribunal does not
agree with Respondent, however, that Claimant has filed an “unsubstantiated and
outrageous damages claim.””””> It further considers that the allocation of costs incurred

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 626 of 1447

by the Parties for presenting their claims and defenses in this arbitration should not be
based on considerations referring to “other claimants” and thus considerations unrelated
to this arbitration. In the Tribunal’s view, it also does not impact either the integrity or
the respectability of the ICSID system if costs are allocated by looking at the findings
made in all phases of this arbitration.

1838.This arbitration has consisted of three separate phases involving separate written
submissions, separate oral hearings and separate decisions by the Tribunal. In each of
these phases, both Parties incurred significant amounts of costs for presenting their claims
and defenses. Taking into account that only one of these phases concerned the amount of
damages requested by Claimant, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to allocate
the costs for all three phases, i.e., including the phase addressing jurisdiction and liability
as well as the phase addressing Respondent’s allegations of corruption, based on the
proportion of success in the final quantum phase. The same applies to additional decisions
rendered by the Tribunal on Claimant’s 2012 Provisional Measures Request as well as on
Respondent’s Reconsideration Request.

1839. The Tribunal further notes that both Parties have criticized the procedural conduct of the
other Party and argue that such conduct should be taken into account as an independent
reason to award it the costs it has incurred in this arbitration. In the Tribunal’s view, the
outcome of the proceedings should and will be the primary basis for allocating the costs
of the arbitration. However, certain procedural conduct which resulted in a significant
incurease of costs on both sides, without there being a justification for such costs from an
objective point of view, may also be taken into account in determining the final allocation
of costs.

1840. At the outset of this arbitration, Claimant filed its 2012 Provisional Measures Request,
which involved written submissions and an oral hearing following which the Tribunal
decided not to recommend any provisional measures. The Tribunal did order Respondent,
however, to inform the Tribunal and Claimant, on a regular basis, about its specific plans
and activities with respect to deposit H-4 as well as of any change of its present intentions
to implement the work plan for H-4, not to expand its mining activities to H-14 and H-
15, and not to give any rights in this regard to any third party. No further decision was
required on that matter.

1841.Claimant has fully prevailed on the matters of jurisdiction, admissibility, liability and the
counterclaims raised by Respondent. More specifically, the Tribunal affirmed the general
jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention, in particular that Claimant has
made a qualifying “investment,” it dismissed both of Respondent’s objections on
jurisdiction and admissibility, and it made an affirmative finding on all three breaches of
the Treaty that Claimant has alleged. It further dismissed the counterclaim raised by
Respondent, in part on jurisdiction and in part on the merits.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -616-

1842.After the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, Respondent raised allegations of

corruption which led to a separate phase dealing with Respondent’s Application to
Dismiss the Claims on that basis. Following the Parties’ written submissions, oral
hearings involving a large number of witnesses as well as forensic experts from both
sides, the Tribunal found that Respondent had failed to prove any of its factual allegations
of corruption.

1843.Shortly after filing its Counter-Memorial on Quantum, Respondent filed a

Reconsideration Request in which it requested that the Tribunal reconsider certain
findings made on jurisdiction and liability. Following Claimant’s Request for Summary
Dismissal of the Reconsideration Request and further submissions from both Parties, the
Tribunal rejected Respondent’s Reconsideration Request.

1844. Finally, on quantum, the Tribunal found it appropriate to follow the valuation approach

presented by Claimant and its expert. It further found that none of the risks and issues
raised by Respondent and its various experts impacted the feasibility of the project and
with regard to a large majority of these issues, the Tribunal was also not convinced that
they had an impact on the value of Claimant’s investment. The Tribunal did make certain
adjustments to the value of Claimant’s investment as calculated by Prof. Davis, in
particular with regard to the security risks caused by political violence and the risk that
the mining lease might not be renewed or might not be renewed on the same terms after
its initial 30-year term. In addition, the Tribunal held that a further deduction had to be
made to fully account for the systematic risks affecting a project with a 56-year life of
operations. The Tribunal also notes, however, that Respondent’s experts did not present
an alternative income-based valuation on which the Tribunal could have relied to verify
its conclusions or even an update of the calculations made in the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study to the valuation date even though they relied on these calculations in
support of their criticism of the valuation method proposed by Claimant. Moreover, while
Respondent did present an alternative, market-based valuation, the Tribunal has
determined above that this valuation could not be used as an indicator of the project’s
value as of the valuation date given that Respondent’s expert had not assigned any value
at all to the exploration work carried out by Claimant in the five years between the
acquisition of Claimant by Barrick and Antofagasta and the valuation date.

1845.On balance, and while being aware that Claimant did not succeed on its 2012 Provisional

Measures Request at the outset of this arbitration and did not fully prevail on its damages
claim in the final phase the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent shall bear
the costs of the arbitration in full. In particular, the Tribunal recalls its finding on liability
that none of the reasons invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or in this arbitration
justified the Licensing Authority’s decision to deny TCCP’s Mining Lease Application.
The Tribunal is convinced that the real motive for the denial of TCCP’s Mining Lease
Application was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own

Award

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -617-

mining project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that

the grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this

motive. The Tribunal concluded that by denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in

order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead, Respondent has breached

its obligations to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the

Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not

comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty,

and impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

1846. In light of Respondent’s conduct and the absence of any form of compensation, Claimant

had to initiate this arbitration in order to obtain compensation for the loss of its investment

caused by Respondent’s breaches of its obligations under the Treaty. In the final phase of

this arbitration, Claimant has further demonstrated that, contrary to Respondent’s

arguments, the project was technically and economically feasible and could have

proceeded to construction and the operational stage if the mining lease had been granted.

Claimant has further demonstrated that the project had substantial value.

1847. Against this background, the Tribunal considers it justified that Respondent shall bear in

full the costs of the arbitration, which amount in USD to:

1848.In accordance with Regulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial
Regulations, ICSID requested the Parties to pay each of the respective advances on costs

in equal shares. Respondent, however, has not paid its 50% share pursuant to the first

three of the advance payment requests issued by ICSID but has only paid its share of the

fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh advance payment requests. Upon request, Claimant has

therefore paid its own share as well as Respondent’s share of the first three advance

2274 This amount includes charges relating to the dispatch of the Award (courier, printing and copying).

payments on costs in the total amount of USD 2,900,000; Respondent has made payments
in the total amount of USD 1,199,925.00.

1849. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders Respondent to pay to Claimant USD 2,533,277.08,
which is the net amount after deducting from the full amount that Claimant has paid as
advance on costs to ICSID, i.e., USD 2,900,000.00, the refund of USD 366,722.92 to be
made by ICSID to Claimant.

2. The Costs Incurred by the Parties in Connection with this Arbitration

1850.Second, the Tribunal will assess the question of who shall bear the fees and expenses
incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration. The Tribunal notes that both
Parties have incurred substantial amounts of costs in the arbitration. Neither Party has
sought leave to file a response to the other Party’s Submission on Costs and, in particular,
no objections to the reasonableness of the other Party’s costs have been raised. As
reflected in the summaries of the procedural history included in the Tribunal’s Decision
on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal’s Decision on Respondent’s Application to
Dismiss the Claims (with Reasons) and this Award, both Parties have employed
substantial efforts to present their claims and defenses in each phase of this arbitration,
each of which concerned a large number of highly complex factual and/or legal issues.
Both Parties relied on a large number of factual and expert witnesses as well as a
comprehensive amount of factual exhibits and legal authorities. Against this background
and in the absence of any objection from either Party, the Tribunal sees no reason to
question the reasonableness of the costs incurred by the Parties and/or to make deductions
with regard to the amount of recoverable costs.

1851.Both Parties have separately presented the costs they have incurred in each of four stages
of the arbitration: (i) Request for Arbitration, appointment of the Tribunal, Claimant’s
2012 Provisional Measures Request; (ii) written submissions and Hearing on Jurisdiction
& Liability; (iii) Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims based on allegations of
corruption; and (iv) quantum.

1852. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent shall
also bear the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this proceeding. While
Claimant has not succeeded on its 2012 Provisional Measures Request at the first stage
and certain deductions had to be made from the amount of compensation requested by
Claimant at the final stage, the Tribunal considers that, on balance, these aspects are
outweighed by the fact that: (i) Claimant has fully succeeded on jurisdiction and liability,
including an affirmative finding on all three Treaty breaches alleged by Claimant, as well
as in defending against Respondent’s counterclaims; (ii) Claimant has successfully
defended against each of Respondent’s allegations of corruption, with the Tribunal having
found no proven incident of Claimant exercising, or attempting to exercise, improper
influence on Government officials aimed at obtaining rights or benefits relating to

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 630 of 1447
Award
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 Page -619-

Claimant’s investment in Pakistan; and (iii) Claimant has proven that the project was
technically and economically feasible and had substantial value. Furthermore, neither of
the two aspects changes the fact that Claimant had to initiate this arbitration in order to
receive the amount of compensation to which it is entitled as a result of Respondent’s
Treaty breaches.

1853.As an additional consideration, it must be noted that Respondent has raised various
defenses in this arbitration which were found to be almost entirely meritless but
nevertheless caused the proceedings to extend over a significant period of time and the
Parties to incur large amounts of costs. In particular, in the quantum phase in which
Claimant has succeeded to a considerable extent, albeit not in the full amount, Respondent
chose to defend itself by presenting expert reports from an array of experts on the subjects
of mineral resources, metallurgy, project execution, water supply, security, environmental
and social impacts, permitting and approvals, as well as financing, but most of the
criticisms raised by these experts turned out to be unconvincing and without any merit.
As already expressed in its general remarks in Section VII.A.3 above, the Tribunal also
recalls that none of these issues was raised by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of
Intent to Reject and there is no evidence in the record that any other agency or official of
the GOB or the GOP raised these issues during the time period in which the joint venture
partners were still collaborating or even when the GOB had decided to take over the
project and deny TCCP’s Mining Lease Application in violation of Respondent’s
obligations under the Treaty. It was only during these arbitration proceedings that
Respondent started to invoke additional grounds as allegedly critical issues that
purportedly rendered the project unfeasible. In addition, Claimant was the only Party
which presented the Tribunal with a valuation that could form the basis for the Tribunal’s
assessment of Claimant’s damages, whereas the only valuation presented by Respondent
and its experts did not serve to assist the Tribunal in the task at hand, i.e., determining the
value of Claimant’s investment.

1854. While it is of course for each Party to decide on the strategy of how to defend against a
claim brought forward against it, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that this Party also
bear the consequences caused by that strategy. In this case, this applies in particular to
the large amount of costs that Claimant had to incur in order to defend against the
unproven allegations of corruption and the largely unfounded criticisms raised in the
quantum phase. In the Tribunal’s view, it is therefore justified that Respondent be ordered
to bear the full costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this arbitration, i.e.,
including the costs incurred by Claimant in the quantum phase. In addition, Respondent
shall bear its own costs that it has incurred in connection with the arbitration.

1855.Consequently, Respondent shall reimburse to Claimant a total amount of
USD 59,447,596.60, consisting of: (i) legal fees and costs for its international counsel in
the amount of USD 51,055,326.59 and for its local counsel in the amount of

USD 943,361.06; (ii) fact witness expenses in the amount of USD 1,668,484.49;
(iii) expert witness expenses in the amount of USD 4,774,505.01; and (iv) other expenses
in the amount of USD 1,005,919.45.

3. Post-Award Interest on Costs

1856. Finally, Claimant requests that it be awarded post-award interest on any amount of costs.

awarded to it until full payment of those amounts is made.

1857.The Tribunal considers it appropriate to award interest on the amount of costs that

Respondent is ordered to reimburse at the same post-award interest rate as on the principal

amount of compensation, i.e., at a rate corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1

percentage point, compounded annually. Such interest shall start to accrue from the date
of this Award.

IX. DECISION BY THE TRIBUNAL

1858.The Tribunal therefore decides as follows:

L

IL.

Til.

IV.

To the extent that the Tribunal has previously admitted evidence submitted by
the Parties in the present phase of the proceeding de bene esse, such evidence
is admitted into the record.

Respondent shall pay to Claimant USD 4,087 million as principal amount of
compensation for the breaches, as determined in the Tribunal’s Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability dated 10 November 2017, of Respondent’s
obligations under Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Agreement between
Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection
of Investments relating to Claimant’s investment in Pakistan.

Respondent shall further pay to Claimant pre-award interest on the principal
amount of compensation under II., as of 15 November 2011 until the date of
this Award, at a rate corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1 percentage
point, compounded annually.
