INTRODUCTION

A. The Parties

limited liability company incorporated and existing under the laws of Ghana, with its registered
office in Accra, Ghana. BEC’s sole shareholder is Balkan Energy Limited, a company
incorporated in the United Kingdom (“Balkan UK”), which in turn is wholly owned by Balkan

B. Background of the dispute

‘The present dispute concerns a Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”) entered into by the Parties
on 27 July 2007, with an effective date of 31 October 2007.' Faced with a severe power
shortage, in 2007, Ghana entered into negotiations with Balkan US for the refurbishment and
commissioning of the one hundred and twenty-five megawatt (125MW) dual fired (diesel and
gas) Osagyefo Power Barge (“Barge”) and associated facilities (“Power Station”) in Effasu in

Ghana’s western region, which was then unused.’ Under the PPA, BEC was to commission the

Power Purchase Agreement Between the Government of Ghana, Acting by and through its Minister for
Energy and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited on Osagyefo Power Barge and Associated Facilities Effasu
Project July 2007 (“PPA”), (In the Matter of an Arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited v. The

Barge within 90 working days of the effective date of the PPA; convert it into a combined cycle
power plant by the addition of certain facilities; upgrade the capacity of the Barge; and invest in
infrastructure to enable natural gas to be supplied to the Barge.’ For its part, Ghana was to
ensure that all electricity necessary for the refurbishment and commissioning of the Barge was
provided; facilitate the acquisition of government approvals, visas, and equipment; construct
and install the transmission line required for connection to the national grid; and take and pay

for all electricity thereafter generated by the Power Station.*

Each Party alleges that the other has failed to perform its obligations under the PPA. For its
part, BEC contends that Ghana has failed to provide adequate site electricity;* failed to provide
a connection to the national grid through a proper transmission Jine;* and failed to comply with
its obligation to facilitate the importation of equipment and the acquisition of all necessary
BEC further contends that, under Article 11.9 of the PPA, it is

 

permits, approvals, and vis
owed tolling fees since 28 October 2008, the date on which it alleges that the Power Station
would have been completed but for Ghana’s failure to provide an adequate transmission line
and interconnection facilities.’ The tolling fees are meant not only to cover the cost of
electricity but also remunerate BEC for its investments. BEC states that it has since 25
November 2008 sent to Ghana invoices totalling over USD 50,000,000 in respect of tolling

fees.”

For its part, Ghana contends that it has fulfilled its obligations and claims that the Power Station
has never been operational because of breaches of the agreement by BEC.” By letter dated 28
August 2009, Ghana’s Ministry of Energy stated that Ghana had provided BEC with grid
connectivity via the transmission line and interconnection facilities, and asserted that the fact
that the Power Station was not operational was due to BEC’s own inability to complete the

facilities.'' Ghana also claims that the upgrading of certain necessary equipment was not

undertaken by BEC. Moreover, Ghana asserts that recent efforts by it to inspect the Barge and
to test whether it is operational “have been repeatedly rebuffed and refused by [BEC]”.'?
Relying on statements made by BEC in a lawsuit filed in a United States District Court against a
subcontractor on the Barge, Ghana asserts that BEC’s claim that the Barge is operational is

fraudulent.'® Ghana also disputes the BEC invoices referred to above.'*

After unsuccessful attempts to resolve their differences, the Parties explored the alternative of
dispute resolution through arbitration. By letter dated 28 August 2009, Ghana stated that the
dispute regarding the invoices “must be resolved by arbitration before any payments can be

made to BEC” by Ghana.'* By letter dated 1 September 2009, Ghana stated that, in light of the

 

Parties’ differences, “we have come to the conclusion that there is a dispute between the parties

which cannot be settled through direct discussions . . . ”. Ghana therefore “invoke[d] clause

22.2 of the PPA” and “recommend{ed] that the issue be referred to the Permanent Court of

 

Arbitration for resolution”.'°

However, this course of action was ultimately not pursued by the Respondent. Rather it was the
Claimant that on 23 December 2009 filed a Notice of Arbitration. In the arbitration BEC sought
a declaration that Ghana had breached the PPA; an order that Ghana pay tolling fees of not less
than USD 50,000,000 as well as damages for breaches of the PPA; and an order that Ghana

fulfil its obligations under the PPA within six months from the date of the award.'”

On 25 June 2010, after the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal and four days before the First

Procedural Meeting between the Parties was scheduled to take place on 29 June 2010, Ghana

 

applied for and was granted an interlocutory injunction against the arbitral proceedings by the
High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) in Accra, Ghana (“Ghana High Court”). The

injunction (“Ghana High Court Order”) restrained BEC from, inter alia, taking any further steps

letters, dated 8 and 10 February 2010. Ghana’s Attorney General and Minister of Justice referred to
BEC’s letter of 2 February 2010, and stated that “[iJt is evident that we differ with regard to our
respective interpretations of article 11.7 of the Power Purchase Agreement;” and “[t]he government of
Ghana has more than complied with the terms of that provision. Thus, “{w]e have no intention of
facilitating your client's execution of its expressed determination to draw down on letters of credit when
it has not delivered on its commitments and is not entitled to draw down under the terms and conditions
of the Power Purchase Agreement”. Claimant's Answers to Questions Submitted to the Parties by the

in the arbitration proceedings pending final determination of the suit before the Ghana High
Court. Ghana alleged, in its suit before the High Court, that the PPA and the arbitration clause,
which is part of the PPA, are void for lack of prior Parliamentary approval.'* On 6 September
2010, the Ghana High Court issued a ruling (“Ghana High Court Ruling”) confirming the Order
and dismissing the Claimant’s application for a stay of ings.'® The facts concerning

actions before Ghanaian courts will be examined further below.

The issue at present before the Tribunal relates only to its jurisdiction in this case. The
Respondent contends that both the PPA and the arbitration clause are void because the PPA did
not receive Parliamentary approval as required by the Constitution of Ghana. The Claimant
maintains that both questions are properly before this Tribunal. These jurisdictional questions

will be examined and decided in this Interim Award.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

By Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the PPA and
Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law of 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”), BEC commenced arbitration against Ghana.” In
accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, BEC proposed that the dispute be decided by three
arbitrators.’ BEC noted that the PPA stipulated that the place of arbitration would be The
Hague, and that the arbitration would take place under the auspices of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (“PCA”), that the arbitration would be governed by and conducted in accordance
with the UNCITRAL Rules; and that the PPA would be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Republic of Ghana. Noting that the PPA did not expressly state
the language in which the arbitral proceedings were to be conducted, BEC requested, in
accordance with Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Rules, that the language of the arbitration be

English, following the language of the PPA and all communications between the Parties.””

and Attorney-General, Mrs. Betty Mould-Iddrisu, Ghana’s Solicitor-General, Mrs. Amma A.

Gaisie, informed BEC that Ghana agreed to the number of arbitrators being three, with each
Party nominating one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators together appointing the third. Ghana
also agreed that, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the PPA, the arbitration would take place at the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, and would be governed by and conducted in
accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules. Finally, Ghana agreed that the language of the
arbitration would be English, and notified BEC that it would be represented in the arbitration by
the Minister of Justice, the Honourable Mrs. Betty Mould Iddrisu.”*
On 15 January 2010, the Claimant appointed Judge Stephen M. Schwebel as the first
arbitrator.** By letter dated 17 February 2010, Ghana stated that it had no record of receiving a
Notification of Appointment from BEC; that it would deem BEC’s letter of 16 February 2010 to
be such Notification; and that it would appoint an arbitrator by 16 March 2010.° By letter dated
23 February 2010, BEC agreed that it would not seek any action from the appointing authority
until 16 March 2010.” On 12 March 2010, the Respondent appointed Judge Thomas A. Mensah
as the second arbitrator.”
On | April 2010, the Co-arbitrators notified the Parties that they had chosen Professor Francisco
Orrego Vicufia as the President of the Tribunal.”*
By letter dated 28 April 2010, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement that the First
Procedural Meeting would take place on 29 June 2010 in Paris, France.””
The Tribunal was informed in June 2010 that, on 22 February 2010, BEC had applied to the
District Court of Amsterdam for leave to attach certain assets of the Government of Ghana in
the Netherlands. On 24 February 2010, the District Court had granted leave to attach assets up
to USD 66,330,000, pending the determination of the arbitration. However, no attachments
were successfully placed, because the Government of Ghana had no assets in the relevant bank

accounts.” As will be explained below, the Claimant later gave an undertaking before the

Ghana High Court that it would seek no further conservatory attachments of the Respondent’s

assets in any jurisdiction pending the final determination of the arbitration.

On 25 June 2010 the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, on that same day, the Ghana High
Court had issued an interlocutory injunction restraining BEC from proceeding with the
arbitration; taking further steps to attach assets of the Government of Ghana; or instituting or
pursuing any other arbitration proceedings or seeking any other relief in any jurisdiction outside
Ghana in relation to the dispute.*! Both Parties submitted their views on the effect of the Ghana
High Court Order on the present proceedings. The Tribunal, having considered both Parties’

views, decided to postpone the First Procedural Meeting “until both the relevant facts and the

 

Parties’ positions have been more fully clarified”.

On 2 July 2010, the Tribunal adopted the Terms of Appointment, which reflected points of
agreement communicated by the Parties in a joint letter of 8 June 2010 and telephone
communications of 11 June 2010, The Terms of Appointment confirmed the UNCITRAL Rules
as the governing rules and the laws of the Republic of Ghana as the governing law, and
designated English as the language of arbitration and The Hague, the Netherlands, as the place
of arbitration. The Parties also agreed that, notwithstanding this latter designation, the Tribunal
will conduct hearings or meetings in London, England, unless the Tribunal, after having
consulted with the Parties, finds it appropriate that a specific hearing or meeting be held in
another location. The Parties also agreed that the Tribunal may conduct hearings or meetings by
telephone. Finally, the Terms of Appointment recorded the terms of Tribunal remuneration and
PCA Registry support.”?

On 2 July 2010, the Tribunal also adopted Procedural Order No. 1, communicating the
Tribunal’s decision to address questions regarding the validity of the arbitration clause
contained in Article 22.2 of the PPA as a preliminary matter. The Tribunal requested the Parties
to submit simultaneously, by 2 August 2010, written briefs addressing the following questions:
(a) whether the Tribunal is competent to rule on the validity of the PPA and of the arbitration
clause contained in Article 22 thereof; (b) whether the PPA is valid; (c) whether the Parties are
bound by an agreement to arbitrate in respect of the proceedings initiated by the Claimant in its
Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009; and (d) whether the Injunction issued by the
Court of Justice (Commercial Division) in Accra on 25 June 2010, or any other court order of a

similar nature that may be issued in the future, affects the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Both

Parties were invited to submit reply briefs to address the arguments of the opposing Party within

20 days from receipt of the briefs referred to above.

By letter dated 13 July 2010, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that, pursuant to the Ghana
High Court Order, the Respondent considered that the Parties would be unable to make any
submissions to the Tribunal regarding Procedural Order No. 1 or Draft Procedural Order No. 2,
at least until after the hearing scheduled for 20 July 2010 in Ghana or such time as the Ghana
High Court issued a further ruling. The Respondent observed that for either Party to make

submissions to the Tribunal would subject the offending Party to contempt.”

By letter dated 23 July 2010, the Claimant notified the Tribunal that the hearing before the
Ghana High Court did not proceed as planned, but had been rescheduled for 27 July 2010. The
Claimant requested an extension of the deadline for submission of the written briefs set out in

Procedural Order No. | until 14 August 2010.%°

On 27 July 2010, the Tribunal amended Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1 to extend the due
date for filing of briefs on the matters set out in that Section until 14 August 2010; notified the
Parties that it intended to hold the oral hearing on the same matters on 15 October 2010 in
London, England; and requested the Parties to keep the Tribunal informed about relevant
developments in connection with any hearings before or decisions adopted by the Ghana High

Court.”

On 27 July 2010, taking into account the Parties’ comments, the Tribunal also adopted
Procedural Order No. 2, providing additional direction on procedural matters such as quorum
and decisions; forms of decisions, notifications and motions: evidence, document production;
and records of hearings.

On 30 July 2010, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that, as a result of recent filings by both

14 September 2010, and the due date for reply briefs to 4 October 2010."

On 7 September 2010, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, on the previous day, the
Ghana High Court had dismissed BEC’s motion to stay the court proceedings in Ghana and to
compel arbitration, but had granted Ghana’s request to confirm the interlocutory injunction,

pending the determination of the court proceedings in Ghana.*!

On 8 September 2010, the Tribunal confirmed the due date of 14 September 2010 for filing of
the briefs on the matters set out in Section | of Procedural Order No, 1, and the due date for
reply briefs of 4 October 2010, The Tribunal also invited the Parties to address in their briefs
the implications of the Ghana High Court Ruling of 6 September. Finally, the Tribunal
confirmed the date of 15 October 2010 for the oral hearing on the matters set out in Section 1 of
Procedural Order No. 1, to be held in London, England.”

On 14 September 2010, both Parties submitted to the Tribunal briefs on the matters set out in
Section | of Procedural Order No. 1.

On 4 October 2010, both Parties submitted to the Tribunal reply briefs regarding the matters

A. Conclusion of the Power Purchase Agreement

In 2007, the Republic of Ghana faced a severe power shortage.’ As a step toward addressing

 

this crisis, the Government of Ghana engaged in negotiations with Balkan US in order to
conclude an agreement for Balkan to refurbish and recommission the 125-megawatt Osagyefo

Barge in Effasu in the Western Region of Ghana.“*

In furtherance of these negotiations, Balkan US sent an Expression of Interest, dated 10 May
2007, promising a complete technical proposal for the commissioning of the Barge.“* Ghana’s
Ministry of Energy responded by inviting Balkan US to see the Barge to assist with the
preparation of the proposal.“° A Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”), dated 16 May 2007,
was signed by Ghana’s Minister of Energy, the Honourable Joseph K. Adda, and by Mr. Phillip
Elders, Senior Vice President for Balkan US. The MOU called for a Power Purchase Agreement
to stipulate the final terms and conditions of the agreement between the two Parties.” The PPA
was subsequently negotiated by the Parties with the participation of government and corporate

officials."*

Article 12 of the Ghana Energy Commission Act of 1997 (Act 541) requires that, for a company
to hold a license for buik energy supply in Ghana, it must be incorporated in Ghana.” To meet
this requirement, BEC was, with the agreement of Ghana, registered under the Companies
Code, 1963 (Act 179) of Ghana as a locally incorporated company on 16 July 2007. The

ownership structure of BEC has been explained in paragraph | above.*°

PPA, Preamble.

Notice of Arbitration, paras. 24-26; Respondent’s Brief, at 3. The Parties appear to dispute the status and
condition of the Barge at the time of their negotiations. The Claimant states, “At the time of the
conclusion of the PPA, the Osagyefo Power Barge had already been in Ghana since 2002 without ever
having been used. This means the Power Station had never run and was in a state of neglect”. Notice of
Arbitration, para. 24. By contrast, the Respondent states that the Barge, “over time from non-use, was in
need of repair”. Respondent’ Brief, at 3.

22 December 2010

The PPA was signed by representatives of both Parties on 27 July 2007.°"

In Article 29.2 of the PPA, Ghana warranted that:

{The Government of Ghana] has the full power, authority, and legal right to carry
on its business as now conducted. The [Government of Ghana] has taken all actions
necessary or reasonably requested by BEC to authorize it to execute, deliver,
perform and observe the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other
documents, The [Respondent] has the full legal right, power and authority for and
on behalf of the Government of Ghana to pledge the full faith and credit of the
Republic of Ghana under the terms of the Agreement.

The [Government of Ghana] has duly executed and delivered this Agreement on or
before the Agreement date . . . . This Agreement has been executed and delivered
and constitutes, and will constitute, a direct, general, and unconditional legal
obligation of the [Government of Ghana] which is legal, valid, and binding upon
the [Government of Ghana] and enforceable against the [Government of Ghana] in
accordance with its respective terms, and for which the full faith and credit of the
Republic of Ghana is pledged.

 

 

Additionally, Article 7.2 of the PPA conditioned the effectiveness of the PPA on issuance,

within 14 days of its execution, of a letter from the Government of Ghana that all required

approvals from the relevant authorities in Ghana had been obtained, as well as a legal opinion of

the Attorney-General of Ghana as to the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of the

agreement.” Specifically, the legal opinion was to address Article 181(5) of the Constitution of

Ghana, which requires Parliamentary approval for any “international business or economic

transaction to which the Government is a party”.

On 26 October 2007, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of Ghana, the Honourable

Joe Ghartey, issued two legal opinions. The first opinion stated:

After examining the attached documents we are satisfied that . . .

. . . the power producer, Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited (BEC) is a locally
incorporated company and as a result the PPA does not come under the ambit of
Article 181(5) of the 1992 Constitution which stipulates that an international

busin

 

$ or economic transaction to which the Government is a party should be

submitted to Parliament for approval. In the Supreme Court case of Attorney
General versus Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd. (2005-2006) . . . the Supreme Court held
that international business or economic transaction means international business or

PPA.

international economic transaction. This clearly excludes the project hereof which
involves a local company in a local transaction with the Government.

In light of the above a Parliamentary approval would not be required for the
effectiveness of the Agreement{}.°°

The second legal opinion stated:

I have examined executed copies of the [PPA and project Site Lease (“Project
Agreements”)] and such other documents as I have considered necessary or
desirable to examine in order that I may give this opinion

1am of the opinion that:

(i) {The Government of Ghana] has the power to enter into the Project
Agreements and to exercise its rights and perform its obligations there
under, and execution of the Project Agreements on behalf of [the
Government of Ghana] by the person(s) who executed the Project
Agreements was duly authorised;

(ii) all acts, conditions and things required by the laws and constitution of the
Republic of Ghana to be done, fulfilled and performed in order (a) to
enable [the Government of Ghana] lawfully to enter into, exercise its rights
under and perform the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in the
Project Agreements, (b) to ensure that the obligations expressed to be
assumed by it in the Project Agreements are valid and enforceable by
appropriate proceedings and (c) to make the Project Agreements admissible
in evidence in the Republic of Ghana, have been done, fulfilled and
performed in compliance with the laws and constitution of the Republic of
Ghana;

(iii) The obligations of [the Government of Ghana] under the Project
Agreements are legal and valid obligations binding on [the Government of
Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Project
Agreements;

(iv) [The Government of Ghana] is not entitled under the terms of the Project
Agreements to claim any immunity from suit, execution, attachment or
other legal process in the Republic of Ghana and such waiver is legal and
binding on [the Government of Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with
the terms of the Project Agreements; and

(vy) The sanctity of contract is recognised under the laws of Ghana and
consequently the validity of the Project Agreements and the binding nature
of the obligations of the parties there under are constitutionally
safeguarded.”

22 December 2010

On 30 October 2007, the Minister for Energy of Ghana, Mr. Adda, noted in a communication to

 

issued a

 

Mr. Elders that, as per the conditions precedent in Article 7 of the PPA, Ghana had:
legal opinion as to the validity, enforceability and binding effect of the PPA; issued to BEC a
standby letter of credit, as required by Article 11.7; and provided BEC with construction power
at the Effasu site. Mr. Adda also acknowledged that BEC had submitted to Ghana: copies of
BEC’s Certificate of Incorporation, Certificate to Commence Business, and Regulations of
BEC; copies of resolutions adopted by BEC’s Board of Directors authorizing the execution,
delivery and performance by BEC of the PPA; and copies of a resolution adopted by BEC
shareholders authorizing the execution, delivery and performance by BEC of the PPA, certified
by the BEC Secretary. In the communication, Mr. Adda declared 31 October 2007 to be the
PPA Effective Date.”

Under the PPA, the Parties agreed that, whereas Ghana had an urgent need for additional
electricity generation to meet its power supply deficiencies, BEC, bearing all costs, estimated at
USD 40 million, would lease the Power Station from Ghana, and would commission it within
90 working days of the effective date of the PPA; that BEC, bearing all costs, estimated at USD.
100 million, would convert the Power Station into a combined cycle power plant by the addition
of a heat recovery steam generator with an incremental capacity of approximately 6(0MW, a
steam turbine, and electric generator and associated facilities within nine months of the
effective date of the PPA; that BEC, at an estimated cost of USD 250 to 300 million, would
privately invest and bring two more combined cycle barge mounted systems, with capacity of
approximately 185 megawatts each, to the site within thirty-six months of agreement on a
tolling fee for the systems; that BEC would, subject to satisfactory conclusion of supply
agreements with other source providers and at an estimated cost of USD 100 million, invest in
infrastructure to enable natural gas to be supplied to the Power Station within three years of the
effective date of the PPA; and that BEC would provide all fuel to the Project at cost.**

Under the PPA, the Parties also agreed that Ghana would ensure that all necessary electricity
was provided, at BEC’s cost, and made available at the site as reasonably required by BEC; that
Ghana would promptly facilitate the acquisition of governmental approvals for the duty-free
importation and transportation of equipment to the site, for operating permits, licenses and
approvals for the project, and for visas and work permits for foreign personnel and for full
compliance with all local and other regulations; that Ghana thereby guaranteed that BEC would
have the exclusive right to generate electricity from the site subject to meeting the agreed

timetable; that Ghana would facilitate the acquisition of all governmental approvals required for
Claimant’s Answers, Exhibit C-32.

the leasing, equipping and operation of the Power Station, including relevant environmental
permits from the Environmental Protection Agency; that Ghana would construct, install and
connect the transmission line and relay protection equipment necessary to connect the Power
Station to the national grid, except that BEC would be responsible, at its own cost, for provision
of adequate transmission cables to the point of interconnection with Ghana’s national electricity
grid; that Ghana would take and pay for all eleciricity generated by the Power Station during the

term of the Agreement.”

Under the PPA, the Parties also agreed that they would mutually collaborate with each other in
order to achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the performance by each Party of its
obligations, and that Ghana would provide full and timely cooperation in connection with
BEC’s efforts to finance the Power Station on a non-recourse, project finance basis, including,
without limitation, responding to all requests for information on and certification of Ghana's

authority and the status of the PPA.“

The PPA further provides that, should BEC be unable to commence testing of the Power Station
as a result of Ghana's failure to provide an adequate transmission line and interconnection
facilities for the Power Station, Ghana would be obligated to commence paying tolling fees to
BEC on the thirtieth day after BEC certified to Ghana that the Power Station was complete or

would have been complete except for Ghana’s non-performance.

Finally, Article 22.2 of the PPA provides, in relevant part:
if any disputes arise out of or in relation to this Agreement and if such matter
cannot be settled through direct discussion of the Parties, the matter shall be
referred to binding arbitration at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Peace Palace,
Carnegieplein 2, 2517 KJ in The Hague, The Netherlands. . . . Applications may be
made to such court for judicial recognition of the award and/or an enforcement as
the case may be. Arbitration shall be governed by and conducted in accordance
with UNCITRAL rules.

B. Initiation of proceedings in Ghana

As noted above, by Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009, BEC initiated arbitral
proceedings against Ghana on the basis of Article 22.2 of the PPA.” The Tribunal was duly

Interim Award

22 December 2010
On 25 June 2010, upon motion ex parte for interlocutory injunction by the Attorney-General of
Ghana, the Ghana High Court issued an injunction, restraining BEC from proceeding with
arbitration pending the determination of the enforceability, under Article 181(5) of the
Constitution of Ghana, of the arbitration clause and the PPA. BEC was additionally restrained
from taking further steps in relation to the 26 February 2010 decision of the District Court of
Amsterdam attaching the Government of Ghana’s assets in the Netherlands pending final
determination of the suit before the Ghanaian courts. Finally, BEC was restrained from
instituting or pursuing any other arbitration proceedings or seeking any other relief in any
jurisdiction outside the jurisdiction of Ghana in respect of the PPA, pending the final
determination of the suit before the Ghanaian courts."
On 5 July 2010, on further application by the Government of Ghana, the Ghana High Court
renewed the order and set 20 July 2010 for argument on the Government’ s motion. °°
On 14 July 2010, the Claimant filed a motion on notice in the Ghana High Court for an order to
stay proceedings and to compel arbitration.°°
On 15 July 2010, BEC gave a specific undertaking before the Ghana High Court that it would
not seek any further conservatory attachments of any of Ghana’s assets in any country, pending
the final determination of the arbitration.”
On 20 July 2010, the hearing before the Ghana High Court did not proceed as planned, and was
rescheduled for 27 July 2010. However, as a result of further filings by both Parties, the
Ghana High Court adjourned the hearing on Ghana’s motion to stay the arbitration, and BEC’s
motion to compel arbitration, to 11 and 12 August 2010.”
On 6 September 2010, the Ghana High Court dismissed BEC’s motion to stay the court
proceedings in Ghana and to compel arbitration, and it granted Ghana’s request for an
interlocutory injunction pending the determination of the court proceedings in Ghana. The
injunction restrains BEC from proceeding with or taking any further steps whatsoever in the
arbitration proceedings instituted by it on 23 December 2009 against Ghana, save to notify the
Ghana High Court Order.

Tribunal of this restraint, pending the final determination of the suit in Ghana; restrains BEC
from taking any further steps in relation to or in connection with a decision made by the District
Court of Amsterdam in the Netherlands on 26 February 2010 attaching assets of Ghana in the
Netherlands, pending final determination of the suit in Ghana; and that BEC, its privies and
agents are restrained from instituting or pursuing any other arbitration proceedings or seeking
any other relief in any jurisdiction outside Ghana in respect of the PPA, pending the final

determination of the suit in Ghana.

In its Ruling, the Court relied on Ghanaian case law, arguments of the Deputy Attorney-
General, and affidavits from officials of the Attomey-General’s Office and the Ministry of
Energy. The Court first found that Ghana had established that the application was neither
frivolous nor vexatious because serious constitutional and legal issues had been raised.”° These
constitutional and legal issues were: whether the PPA and arbitration clause were “international
business or economic transaction{s}” and thus void for failure to obtain prior Parliamentary
approval, and whether the 2005 decision of the Ghana Supreme Court in Attorney General v.
Faroe Atlantic bad determined the constitutional issue, or whether, instead. the corporate veil
should be lifted on BEC.

Furthermore, analyzing the “balance of conveniences,” the Court found that Ghana had made a
strong case that it would suffer greater harm, as compared to mere delay in the arbitral
proceedings, if the application was not granted, including expenses incurred in defending other
proceedings while the matter was pending in Ghana.’' In the Court's view, however, the
dispositive issue was not so much which Party would suffer the greater harm, but whether or not
the harm caused could be easily repaired. In that regard, it found that, whereas the seizure and
disposition of Ghana’s assets would not be easily repaired, BEC could be compensated by
Ghana where necessary.” In determining the balance of convenience, the Court also considered
whether the Arbitral Tribunal possesses competence to decide the constitutional question at
issue in the Ghanaian proceedings, and whether the Tribunal would be bound by any stay of
execution it issued, which is provided for in Ghana’s Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2010
(Act 798) (“GADRA”). Finally, the Court noted the fact that the UNCITRAL Rules permit the

Tribunal to rule on objections at the close of the proceedings.”

Interim Award

22 December 2010

By letter dated 9 September 2010 addressed to the Claimant, Ghana’s Attorney-General and
Minister of Justice Mrs. Mould-Iddrisu stated Ghana’s position that, in view of the decision,
“the proper steps to take in relation to the arbitration proceedings is to ask the Tribunal to
suspend its proceedings pending the determination of the Ghana High Court action. Should
Balkan take any steps with a view to continuing the proceedings, it will be in contempt of court
and we will not hesitate to take appropriate and immediate action. To put the matter beyond
doubt, we would be happy to take steps jointly with you to advise the Tribunal to suspend any

further proceedings including the hearing that it has scheduled for 15" October 2010”.”*

At the Tribunal’s directions, the hearing took place on 15 October as envisaged, and both
Parties were duly in attendance to argue their respective views on the jurisdictional issues
raised. The Tribunal notes that, after the hearing, the procedure for referral of the constitutional
issue to the Supreme Court was nevertheless set in motion by the Respondent's application to
this effect to the Ghana High Court, and notice was served on counsel for BEC on 4 November

2010.” The procedure for pre-trial conference was also set in motion on 5 November 2010.”

On the basis of the Parties’ submissions both in writing and orally the Tribunal is now in a

position to decide the jurisdictional matter disputed.

RELIEF REQUESTED

As noted earlier, the present Interim Award relates exclusively to certain matters that require a
preliminary determination on the part of the Tribunal—notably, the question of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction in these proceedings. The Interim Award does not address the Parties’ substantive
claims and defences. Accordingly, the Tribunal will only restate in the following section the
Parties’ requests for relief to the extent that they pertain to matters covered by the present

Interim Award.”

The Respondent initially requested that the Tribunal “decline to rule on a non-arbitrable matter
—namely, whether the Constitution of Ghana, as properly interpreted, renders the arbitration
agreement unenforceable—and, in any event, suspend these proceedings pending a final

determination by the Ghana court on the constitutional issue before it”.”*

The Claimant, in its initial brief, concluded that “this Arbitral Tribunal is the competent and
correct decision-maker on the question of its jurisdiction” and that “this Arbitral Tribunal has
jurisdiction to proceed with this arbitration”. In addition, the Claimant requested that the
Arbitral Tribunal “issue both a procedural order on the confidentiality of these proceedings, as
well as an anti-suit injunction ordering [the Respondent] to withdraw its requests currently
before the Ghanaian High Court of Justice and to refrain from initiating any further court

proceedings in Ghana or anywhere else”.””

In its Reply Brief, the Respondent stated that the Tribunal “should decline from ruling on a non-
arbitrable matter, or suspend these proceedings pending a decision by the Supreme Court of
Ghana on the applicability of Article 181(5) of the Constitution to the PPA and arbitration
clause therein”. The Respondent also requested that the Tribunal “deny the request for interim

7)

relief sought by Balkan”.

In addition to confirming its position regarding the Tribunal’s competence, the Claimant
restated in its Reply Submission the request that the Tribunal “issue both a procedural order on
the confidentiality of these proceedings, as well as an anti-suit injunction ordering [the

Respondent] to withdraw its requests currently before the Ghanaian High Court of Justice and

 

to refrain from initiating any further court proceedings in Ghana or anywhere else”.

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES TO BE DECIDED BY THE TRIBUNAL

In its Procedural Order No. 1, which was adopted in consideration of the Parties’ initial views
regarding the implications of the Ghana High Court Order of 25 June 2010, the Tribunal had

identified the following points, which it believes to be central to the question of its jurisdiction:

a. The competency of the Tribunal to rule on the validity of the PPA and the arbitration

clause contained in Article 22 thereof;

22 December 2010

b. The validity of the PPA, and whether the Parties are bound by an agreement to
arbitrate in respect of the proceedings initiated by the Claimant in its Notice of
Arbitration dated 23 December 2009;

c. Whether the Ghana High Court Order of 25 June 2010, or any other court order of a
similar nature that may be issued in the future, affects the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,
and the implications of the 6 September 2010 Ghana High Court Ruling in relation to
Ghana's application for an interlocutory injunction and BEC’s motion on notice for a

stay of proceedings.

62. The Tribunal will examine the Parties’ arguments and come to its findings on each of these
points. In so doing the Tribunal wishes to state at the outset that it has the highest respect for the
courts of Ghana and its legal system as a whole. It does not regard the issues disputed as entailing
a legal competition between its competence as an arbitration tribunal and the jurisdiction of the
national courts of Ghana. Rather, it believes that its decision should be taken solely on the basis of
the legal rules and principles that ought to apply, in the light of the Parties’ commitments,
including those specified in Article 22 of the PPA, and of the Tribunal’s aim to seek the most

reasonable alternative in the pursuit of justice.

63. The Tribunal notes with appreciation that the Ghana High Court Order does not question the
competence of this Tribunal, under the UNCITRAL Rules, to give its ruling on objections at the
appropriate point of the proceedings, be it the jurisdictional or the merits phase, nor does it
purport to subject the Tribunal to the orders (e.g., stay of execution) of the Ghana High Court. In
the same spirit of courtesy and respect the Tribunal will not grant the request of the Claimant that
the Tribunal issue an anti-suit injunction ordering Ghana to withdraw its domestic suit or to
refrain from any further court proceedings in Ghana or elsewhere. As indicated below, the
Tribunal will be pleased to take fully into account the views of the courts in Ghana, to the extent
that such views become available in the course of its proceedings. For that purpose, the Tribunal
will endeavour as much as possible to arrange for an ample procedural calendar so as to take

account of this possibility.

 

A. The competency of the Tribunal to rule on the validity of the PPA and the
arbitration clause contained in Article 22 thereof.

 

The Respondent's arguments

64. The Respondent maintains that determination of the validity of either the PPA or the arbitration
clause involves determinations on questions of interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution, and
is, therefore, non-arbitrable. The Respondent further maintains that, even if the Tribunal
nonetheless were to find that it is competent to rule on the validity of either or both agreements,

the proper and practical course would be for the Tribunal to exercise restraint and to await a

definitive determination of the issues of Ghanaian Constitutional law by the Ghana Supreme

Court, which is seized of those issues.

In respect of the Tribunal’s competence to rule on the validity of the PPA, the Respondent
submits that the PPA, by its terms, is expressly governed by Ghanaian law."' The Respondent
asserts that there is a threshold question of Ghanaian constitutional law as to whether the PPA is
valid in the absence of Parliamentary approval. In this regard, the Respondent refers to Article
181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, which provides that the Ghanaian Parliament must
approve any “international business or economic transaction” to which the Government of
Ghana is a party. In the Respondent’s view, the Ghana Supreme Court has not yet clearly
spoken as to whether Article 181(5) applies to transactions that are between the Government of
Ghana and a local entity, but which have international elements. The Respondent refers to the
Ghana High Court Ruling, which found that “serious constitutional questions” exist as to
whether the PPA is an international business or economic transaction, within the meaning of
Article 181(5).°

The Respondent further submits that Ghanaian law is clear that the Ghana Supreme Court is

vested with exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the Ghanaian Constitution, and that questions

relating to the interpretation of the Constitution of Ghana are non-arbitrable.™* In these regards,
the Respondent refers to Article 130(1)(a) of the Ghanaian Constitution, which vests exclusive
original jurisdiction in the Ghana Supreme Court over “all matters relating to the enforcement
or interpretation of this Constitution,’ and to Article 1 of the GADRA, which, in the
Respondent's view, expressly exempts from arbitration issues of “enforcement and
interpretation of the Constitution”.“° The Respondent argues that these two provisions, taken
together, render non-arbitrable the question whether the PPA is void ab initio for failure of

Parliamentary approval.”

The Respondent argues that Ghanaian law governs the arbitration clause and thus also
determines issues of objective arbitrability.’ According to the Respondent, Ghanaian law
governs the arbitration clause because the Parties specifically subjected the PPA to the laws of
Ghana, and the default position in international arbitration is that a choice of law provision in
the main contract also applies to an arbitration clause contained therein. In the Respondent’s
view, there is at least a strong presumption in favour of extending the application of the law of
the main contract to the arbitration clause." The Respondent later clarified that the invalidity of
the arbitration clause is not due to the invalidity of the PPA, but is rather a consequence of the
fact that the arbitration clause is also subject to the same requirements of Article 181(5) of the

Ghanaian Constitution.

The Respondent contends that the conclusion that Ghanaian law governs the arbitration clause
is all the more compelling in this dispute because neither the arbitration agreement nor the PPA.
itself specified the seat for the arbitration. Rather, the seat of the arbitration (in the Netherlands)
and the place of hearing were only agreed to by the Parties’ counsel in May 2010, and were not
part of the PPA. It is the Respondent’s position that at no point during the May 2010
discussions did counsel for either Party suggest or agree that the law of the arbitral seat would
replace Ghanaian law with regard to the substantive validity of either the arbitration clause or of
the PPA, or that the law of the arbitral seat would apply beyond the procedural laws of the

arbitration.”

In the alternative, the Respondent argues that, even if one accepts that no presumption exists in
favour of applying the law governing the main agreement to the arbitration agreement, and the

‘closest connection’ test is applied instead, all factors in this case point to Ghanaian law. These

 

factors include: Ghanaian law governs the main agreement; the place of performance is Ghana;
both Parties to the arbitration agreement are subject to Ghana law; and the object of the
agreement relates entirely to Ghana. In the Respondent's view, the only factor suggesting that
Dutch law should govern the arbitration clause (and thus govern arbitrability) is the Parties’
choice of the Netherlands as the seat of arbitration. However, in view of the strength of the
other factors, and because the claims arise under the substantive laws and policies of Ghana,
this latter choice is of lesser importance. Moreover, the Respondent suggests that, in view of the
reality that any potential challenges to enforcement will arise in Ghana, it makes little sense, at

this stage, to apply Dutch rather than Ghanaian law to the questions of arbitrability.”’

The Respondent disputes what it views as the Claimant’s argument that the Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, New York, 10 June 1958, (“New
York Convention”) prescribes the application of the /ex fori to questions of arbitrability, and
particularly that the lex fori should govern questions of substantive arbitrability in the first
place.”* However, Respondent suggest that, even if the Tribunal decides that it is appropriate to
apply Dutch law, Articles 1020 and 1073 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (“DCCP”)

provide a conflict of laws approach that leads to the application of Ghanaian law, as the law to

which the dispute is most closely connected.”* Moreover, even failing the application of
Ghanaian law pursuant to Articles 1020 and 1073 DCCP, the Respondent argues that the
Ghanaian Constitution may be considered non-arbitrable under Dutch legal provisions that
provide exceptions in respect of matters of public policy and for matters for which exclusive

jurisdiction is vested in a specific court."

The Respondent takes the position that if Ghanaian law governs arbitrability, the validity of the
arbitration clause is non-arbitrable. In the Respondent’s view, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to
hear the instant dispute only if the arbitration clause is valid and binding.”’ However, serious
questions exist as to whether the arbitration agreement itself is an international business or
economic transaction, within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, and
thus invalid for lack of Parliamentary approval. Thus, for the Tribunal to consider the validity of
the arbitration agreement with a view to determining its jurisdiction would require it to engage
in interpretation of a provision of the Ghanaian constitution, a function which Ghanaian law
does not permit an arbitral tribunal to perform. The Respondent refers to the Ghana High Court
Ruling to this effect; to Article 130(1) of the Ghanaian Constitution; and to Article 1 of the
GADRA.” The Respondent further refers to the international law doctrine of “non-
arbitrability,” which it argues permits States, through their national laws, to exempt matters of
fundamental public policy from the purview of arbitration. The Respondent contends that a
decision by the Tribunal that it has competence to answer a question relating to the
constitutional law of Ghana would directly violate the New York Convention and other
conventions.” In the Respondent’s view, the conclusion that the Tribunal is not competent is
particularly appropriate given the fundamentally public nature of the task of constitutional

rp Moreover, the asserts that a by this Tribunal that it is
competent to decide the dispute between the Parties would have the “untenable” consequence
that the review of the Tribunal’s interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution could ultimately

fall to foreign courts (for example, in enforcement proceedings outside Ghana).”*

72. The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s contentions that no “genuine” issue of constitutional
interpretation exists with respect to Article 181(5); that the Respondent has raised the
jurisdictional objection in the Ghanaian courts merely as a pretext to evade an obligation to
arbitrate; and that the constitutional questions are unambiguous and clear. The Respondent
refers to its submissions in the proceedings before the Ghana High Court, in which it sought a
declaration that the PPA is unenforceable because it does not satisfy the requirements specified
by Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution.” The Respondent also refers to the Ghana High
Court's conclusion, after extensive briefing and argument, that the application presented serious
issues of constitutional interpretation." The Respondent suggests that the arguments now made
by the Claimant to this Tribunal are the same that it previously made to, and that were rejected
by, the Ghana High Court."

73. The Respondent also disputes the Claimant’s contention that any genuine issue of constitutional
interpretation that exists is not currently pending before the Ghana Supreme Count. It argues
that the Claimant itself created delay in the referral to the Supreme Court by failing to file its al
defence until 13 October 2010.'” ft disputes the Claimant's estimate for the completion of the
Ghanaian proceedings, including the claim that there will be a mandatory 30-day mediation at

the outset.'°

A delay of six to nine months has been the Respondent’s best estimate as to the
resolution of the issue by the Ghana Supreme Court. As has been noted above proceedings for a
referral to the Ghana Supreme Court and procedures for a pre-trial conference were in fact set in iE
motion in early November 2010." The Respondent maintains that the question of the El
constitutionality of the PPA and the arbitration clause could be avoided neither by the

Respondent, nor by the Ghanaian courts.'” It further notes that the Ghana High Court has i)

damages caused by the delay in the proceedings before the Tribunal, should the Claimant

prevail in the proceedings in Ghana.'®®

With regard to the doctrines of competence-competence and separability, the Respondent
maintains that although Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, Article 1052 of the DCCP, and
the GADRA each provide that the Tribunal may rule on objections to its jurisdiction, none
instructs that the Tribunal must do so. The Respondent further asserts that these doctrines are
not absolute where the existence or validity of an agreement to arbitrate is questioned.'” In the
Respondent’s view, the instant case presents a unique scenario in which both the validity of the

main agreement and the validity of the arbitration agreement are disputed.'

Specifically, the Respondent asserts that, although the separability principle provides that an
arbitration clause is not invalid simply because the underlying contract is invalid, the law that
renders the underlying contract invalid may also render the arbitration clause invalid. The
Respondent stresses that the separability presumption does not necessarily mean that different
bodies of law govern the arbitration clause and the underlying contract. In the Respondent's
view, in the present case, both the PPA and the arbitration clause are subject to Ghanaian law,
and are thus subject to the same challenge for failure to comply with Article 181(5) of the

Ghanaian Constitution.”

Moreover, the Respondent challenges the Claimant's view that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to
consider and to resolve issues concerning its own jurisdiction derives from the arbitration law
that governs the arbitration agreement. In the Respondent’s view, and as it has stated above,
Ghanaian law is explicit that it is exclusively for the Ghana Supreme Court to determine
whether the arbitration clause is invalid, because, in this case, this determination involves a

matter of constitutional interpretation."

The Respondent further argues that, even apart from the Ghana Supreme Court’s exclusive
jurisdiction, as a matter of efficiency, fairness, and institutional competence, the challenge to
the validity of the arbitration agreement in this case should be decided, in the first instance, by

the Ghana Supreme Court. It recognizes that the approach adopted by legal systems differ on

the issue of allocation of competence over jurisdictional objections, and is even prepared to
accept that the “better approach” may well be that questions regarding the scope of the

arbitration agreement should be decided in the first instance by the Arbitral Tribunal. However,

 

it argued that, where there is a credible dispute as to the existence, validity, or legality of an
arbitration agreement, the issues should be decided by the national courts, following full

consideration.!"!

The Respondent asserts, moreover, that the Ghanaian courts were first seized
of the jurisdictional question arising from Article 181(5) of the Constitution, even though the i
Notice of Arbitration was introduced earlier, and it argues that the Ghanaian courts should be

accorded priority to resolve that question.''~ The Respondent acknowledges, however, that the

order of seizure is only a “supplementary consideration”."!

78. The Respondent emphasizes that, even if the Tribunal decides that it may rule on the validity of
the arbitration clause, and further decides that the arbitration clause is valid, the Tribunal is still
faced with the question whether the PPA is valid under the Ghanaian Constitution.''* The
Respondent therefore suggests that the wise and proper course for the Tribunal to follow, as a
matter of international comity, lis pendens arbitralis, practicality, and enforceability, would be
to exercise its discretion to await a definitive interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution by the
Ghana Supreme Court, as the body with greater expertise and the body that is already seized of

the issue.'!*

In this regard, the Respondent adds that the question whether the Tribunal or the
Ghanaian courts were seized first is not determinative under the applicable substantive law {
(although the Tribunal is of course free to consider that question in deciding how to exercise its

16

discretion).""° The Tribunal should accordingly suspend its proceedings pending such

interpretation."”

79. As to enforceability, the Respondent asserts that, although the New York Convention may
permit conflicting decisions on enforcement in different jurisdictions, it is nonetheless a

fundamental principle of international arbitration that a tribunal should attempt to render an

enforceable award.''* The Respondent suggests that any issue regarding the enforcement of a
potential award would arise in Ghana. It further contends that because, under the New York
Convention, the Ghanaian courts will look to their own laws to determine whether the
interpretation of the Constitution was arbitrable, the Tribunal should, at this time, give
deference to the Ghanaian courts regarding arbitrability, and should allow the Ghana Supreme

Court an opportunity to rule on the applicability of Article 181(5) to the arbitration clause.'!?

As regards questions of estoppel, the Respondent argues that the Attorney-General’s statement
to the Claimant, on 1 September 2009, that she was recommending that the issues then in
dispute be referred to arbitration, does not in any way affect the arbitrability of the present
dispute. The Respondent suggests that the Attorney-General’s statement was precipitated by the
Claimant’s threats to unilaterally draw down on a letter of credit. The Respondent asserts that,
upon further review of the constitutional issues involved, both the Attorney-General and the
Solicitor General concluded that the PPA and the arbitration clause are unenforceable under
Article 181(5) of the Constitution, and notes that the Respondent therefore did not proceed to
file for arbitration. The Respondent acknowledges that, under certain circumstances, a party
may waive a jurisdictional argument by commencing and prosecuting an arbitration, or by
participating without raising a jurisdictional defence, but the Respondent asserts that such

circumstances are not present here.'*°

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should reject the Claimant’s request for the issue of
an anti-suit injunction, first, because the proper forum for adjudication of the constitutional
issue is the Ghana Supreme Court, and, second, because it is doubtful that an arbitral tribunal
has competence to restrain the Ghana Supreme Court from interpreting the Constitution of
Ghana, *! The Respondent also disputes the necessity for a confidentiality order, and argues that
it is appropriate for both the Tribunal and the Ghanaian courts to have full knowledge of the
positions taken by the Parties in each of the proceedings, and that no extraordinary circumstance
meriting a confidentiality order exists,’

Finally, the Respondent states that it appears from the Notice of Arbitration that all of the

Claimant's claims are premised on the existence of a valid and enforceable PPA which the

Respondent is alleged to have breached. Therefore, the Respondent suggests that it cannot
conceive of issues in dispute between the Parties that are unconnected to the constitutional

questions and thus subject to arbitration.'**

The Claimant's arguments

83. The Claimant, by contrast, maintains that the Tribunal is the competent and correct decision-

 

maker as to its own jurisdiction, as well as to the validity of the PPA and the validity of the

arbitration clause,'™4

84. The Claimant invokes the principle of competence-competence, which it argues is a universally
accepted principle of international commercial arbitration and a general principle of
international law, and which includes the right of the arbitral tribunal to decide on objections
raised to the validity of an arbitration agreement.'* According to the Claimant, arbitral tribunals
virtually always find that they have power to consider and to decide the extent of their own

jurisdiction.'°

85. The Claimant submits that the arbitration rules in all major jurisdictions, as well as those
applicable in this dispute, recognize the competence-competence principle. In this regard, the
Claimant refers to Article 1052(1) of the DCCP'”’ and to Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL
Rules.'”* In addition, the Claimant argues that the New York Convention, to which the Republic
of Ghana and The Netherlands are signatories, effectively prescribes the recognition of
competence-competence in international arbitrations.” Jt is the Claimant’s position that the
Tribunal was first seized of all issues in dispute between the Parties, and that, under the doctrine
of competence-competence and under the New York Convention regime, the Tribunal, having

been seized first, thus has full authority to make findings in relation to the subsidiary issue—the

applicability of Article 18 1(5)—that is before the Ghanaian courts.'” The Claimant argues that
it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal to brush aside the concept of competence-

competence in order to allow the Ghanaian courts to first decide on Article 181(5).'"!

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent's argument that the validity of the arbitration agreement
is objectively non-arbitrable erroneously shifts the arbitrability inquiry away from the merits of
the dispute to the validity of the arbitration clause and to the question of the Tribunal’s
competence. The Claimant argues that, in this way, the Respondent denies the principle of
competence-competence, under which arbitration tribunals, once arbitration proceedings have
been initiated, always have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement in
the first instance, The argument would also render ineffective any arbitration agreement to
which the Respondent is a party.'*? The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s contention that
competence-competence applies with lesser force where the validity of the arbitration

agreement is questioned.'*?

The Claimant submits that, through the arbitration clause, the Parties did in fact agree that the
applicability of Article 181(5) of Ghana’s Constitution would be determined by an arbitral
tibunal, and suggests that, in view of the Respondent’s identity as a sovereign state, the
Tribunal is the more appropriate forum to make such a determination in this dispute.'** The
Claimant argues that the Respondent’s earlier reliance on the PPA and invocations of the
arbitration clause, before the Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration, are patently inconsistent
with the Respondent’s current positions that the PPA and the arbitration clause are invalid and
that the dispute is non-arbitrable. The Claimant asserts that it indeed filed the Notice of

Arbitration in reaction to the Respondent's earlier position.’

The Claimant further maintains that Dutch, rather than Ghanaian, law applies to questions of
objective arbitrability. In this respect, the Claimant refers to Article 1073 of the DCCP, which
provides that the Netherlands Arbitration Act (Articles 1020 to 1073 of the DCCP) applies to

domestic and international arbitrations in the Netherlands, and to Article 1020 of the DCCP,

which the Claimant argues provides substantive rules of objective arbitrability.'°° Moreover, the
Claimant argues that the conflict of laws rules (private international law), including the
cumulative approach employed by the Respondent, should not be used to determine the law
applicable to arbitrability, but, rather, only to determine the substantive contract law applicable
to the arbitration agreement.'” In the Claimant's view, even if the formal validity of the
arbitration clause is governed by Ghanaian substantive contract law, Ghanaian law does not
govern issues of arbitrability. This is because, in addition to the clear language of Article 1073
of the DCCP, Tribunals usually determine the arbitrability of a dispute on the basis of the law of
the place of arbitration, except in exceptional cases involving matters of public policy.'** The

Claimant argues that that this approach accords with the New York Convention."

In contrast to the Respondent, the Claimant argues that Article 1020(3) of the DCCP contains a
substantive rule of objective arbitrability, by providing that matters of Dutch public policy may

not be decided by arbitration.'“° The Claimant maintains that, under this provision, there is no

141

reason to find that the interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution is non-arbitrable."”’ First, in

the Claimant’s view, the public policy exceptions to arbitrability under Dutch law are

142

exceedingly narrow.” Second, the Claimant argues that, under Dutch law, the vesting of

exclusive jurisdiction in a specific court, such as Article 130 of the Ghanaian Constitution

143

appears to do, does not necessarily exclude arbitration." Finally, the Claimant submits that

involve making decisions on issues of public policy. In this regard, the Claimant suggests that,
among other constitutional rights and obligations, arbitral tribunals regularly apply Article 17 of
the Dutch Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which
provide that parties may waive their fundamental right of access to the courts by agreement,

when ruling on objections to their own jurisdiction."

The Claimant contends that, if the Respondent’s approach were adopted and constitutional
questions were deemed non-arbitrable across the board, governments could effectively block all
arbitral proceedings against them by alleging that interpretation of a constitutional question is

required. In this regard, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's current argument is a mere

145

 

scheme to bring the Parties’ dispute under the contro] of Ghanaian State courts.

Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that Ghanaian law governs objective arbitrability, the
Claimant offers two arguments as to why the present dispute is arbitrable, under Ghanaian law.
First, the Claimant asserts that Article 130 of the Ghanaian Constitution does not necessarily
render the interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution non-arbitrable, This is because, in the
Claimant’s view, the vesting of exclusive jurisdiction in a specific court does not normally
imply that arbitration is excluded. Rather, a court’s exclusive jurisdiction is intended to exclude

the jurisdiction of other courts, and not that of arbitral tribunals.“

Second, assuming that Ghanaian law were to govern objective arbitrability, the Claimant
submits that the Tribunal may nonetheless decide whether the arbitration clause is an
international business or economic transaction because this determination does not require
“interpretation and enforcement” of the Ghanaian Constitution." In the Claimant's view,
Ghanaian case law makes clear that a genuine matter of constitutional interpretation that would
trigger the Supreme Court’s exclusive original jurisdiction arises only where a question of
constitutional law is ambiguous or unclear. A mere allegation that there is an issue of
constitutional interpretation is insufficient.'“* The Claimant refers to, inter alia, the Ghana
Supreme Court’s decision in Agyekum v. Boadi, which, in its view, held that where a question

has been determined by the Supreme Court, reference from another court or tribunal for

interpretation is not appropriate.'’ The Claimant argues that, in this case, the Ghana Supreme
Court has already ruled on the dispositive issue, in its decision in Faroe Atlantic Co. Limited v.
Attorney General. In the Claimant’s view, Faroe Atlantic defined an international business or
economic transaction as one between the Government of Ghana and a foreign company, and
held that the nationality of the company is determined by its place of incorporation.'*° The
Claimant argues that the Tribunal can easily apply this decision to the present case, and that—in
view of the undisputed fact that the Claimant is incorporated under the law of Ghana—any

future challenge to enforcement in Ghana would not succeed.’

93. As an additional matter, the Claimant raises allegations that the proceedings in Ghana have not
been instituted and prosecuted in good faith, but rather in an attempt to frustrate the arbitral
proceedings. According to the Claimant, a genuine interpretation or enforcement action must be

152

commenced in the Supreme Court, and cannot be commenced in the High Court.’ The only
other route to the Supreme Court is provided in Article 130(2), via referral by a court seized of
proceedings in which an issue of interpretation or enforcement arises.'** However, a Party may
not cause delay in arbitral proceedings by filing an interpretation or enforcement action in the

rts that

if the proceeding initiated by the Respondent were to be considered an interpretation or
enforcement action, the High Court would have been without jurisdiction to issue an injunction

against the Claimant.'**

94, It was the Claimant’s contention at the 15 October 2010 hearing that no interpretation or
enforcement action relating to the PPA or to the arbitration agreement was then pending before
the Ghana Supreme Court.'*° It was also argued then that, before reference may even be made
to the Ghana Supreme Court, the pleadings must close; the Parties must go through a 30-day

mandatory mediation in the Commercial Court; the Commercial Court must set down the issues

for trial to determine whether a reference needs to be made; and the latter decision may be
appealed.'*’ The Claimant disputed the Respondent’s contention that arbitration would
commence if the Ghana Supreme Court found that Article 181(5) did not apply to the
agreements. The Claimant asserted that the Respondent would instead attempt to avoid
arbitration by reviving its claim for relief for fraudulent misrepresentation that it argued before
the Ghana High Court as an alternative basis for relief, should it not prevail in the Ghana

Supreme Court.'**

As noted above, both referral and pre-trial conference procedures were started subsequent to the
Tribunal’s hearing on 15 October 2010, following the Respondent's application of 3 November
2010 to the Ghana High Court for reference to the Ghana Supreme Court. In particular, the
Claimant now asserts that it was served, on 5 November 2010, with a notice that the mandatory
30-day mediation has been fixed to begin on 22 November 2010. The Claimant maintains that it
does not expect a decision from the Ghana Supreme Court until the 2011-2012 legal year. This
is because, even if the reference action is successful, it will follow an elaborate statutory
process, involving a transfer of the entire record to the Supreme Court and further filings and
oral testimony by the Parties. The Claimant contends, further, that the Supreme Court’s decision
will not end the matter. Rather, the High Court must then resume its hearing in order to dispose
of the case according to the Supreme Court’s decision, The Claimant states that it does not
anticipate the High Court proceedings will conclude within one year after the Supreme Court's
decision. The time-frame could be further extended by several years should either or both

Parties pursue appeals.'?

With regard to the question raised by the Tribunal at the 15 October 2010 hearing, i.e., whether
the Parties can conceive of issues in dispute between them that are not related to the questions
regarding the applicability of the Ghanaian Constitution, the Claimant respectfully invited the
Arbitral Tribunal to consider, first, whether the Respondent has become unjustly enriched, or
has gained unjust benefits, at the Claimant's expense. In this regard, the Claimant asserts that
the Respondent, through its Attorney-General, represented to the Claimant that all acts and
conditions required to make the PPA valid, legal, binding, and enforceable had been done. The

Claimant further asserts that this representation induced the Claimant to enter into the PPA and

to expend considerable sums on the Barge, which remains in the Respondent’s legal i

ownership,'° Hl

97. Second, the Claimant invites the Tribunal to consider whether the Respondent, by raising the
constitutional defence and by seeking to withdraw from the effects of the opinions and letters
written by the prior Attomey-General and by the Minister for Energy, had independently i
committed the torts of negligent advice and of deceit, In regard to the tort of negligent advice,
the Claimant argues that, by rendering the legal opinion addressed to the Claimant, Ghana’s
Attorney-General assumed, on behalf of the Respondent, a fiduciary duty toward the Claimant.
The Claimant argues that, if the advice given by the Attorney-General was false, then since in

this situation only the Respondent could have obtained the needed Parliamentary approval, it

 

can establish the special relationship and reasonable reliance required to make out a claim for

 

negligent advice. Further, with regard to the tort of deceit, the Claimant argues that, if the
Attorney-General’s opinion was false, the Claimant can establish the deliberate false
representation, inducement, and detrimental reliance required to make out such a claim. In the
Claimant's view, these tort claims are within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and are unconnected to

the questions regarding the applicability of the Ghanaian Constitution.'*
The Tribunal’s findings

98. The Tribunal must note first that, while the Parties agree that the PPA is governed by Ghanaian
law, they disagree as to which law governs the arbitration agreement. Dutch law is favoured by i
the Claimant, while the Respondent maintains that Ghanaian law is the proper law. This issue
has arisen in numerous international arbitrations and procedures conducted before national
courts. The Tribunal will first set out its views as to the legal framework that governs this
arbitration, which will also be determinative of its own jurisdiction or lack thereof.
99. Two bedrock principles of international arbitration bear on the issues before the Tribunal,
namely, the principle of competence-competence, and the principle of separability of the

arbitration clause from the contract of which it is part. As the Respondent has rightly pointed

 

out, the first principle concerns the power of the arbitral tribunal to decide jurisdictional issues
when the arbitration clause is challenged, while the second concerns the substantive validity of i

the arbitration clause."

It is universally agreed that under the principle of competence-competence an international
arbitral tribunal is entitled to determine its own jurisdiction. This principle was first developed
as a rule of public international law governing arbitration between States. That rule is rooted in
State practice going back to the 18" Century, In the Award in the Case of The Betsey it was
declared that: “the doubt respecting the authority of the commissioners to settle their own
jurisdiction was absurd; . . . they must necessarily decide upon cases being within or without

their competency”.'

That the same rule applies to international arbitration has also been well established under the
authority of the International Court of Justice. In the Nottebohm Case it was thus held that
“Paragraph 6 of Article 36 [of the Statute of the Court] merely adopted, in respect of the Court,
a rule consistently accepted by general international law in the matter of international
arbitration. Since the Alabama case, it has been generally recognized, following earlier
precedents, that, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, an international tribunal has
the right to decide as to its own jurisdiction and has the power to interpret for this purpose the
instruments which govern that jurisdiction. This principle was expressly recognized in . . . the
Hague Conventions . . . . The Rapporteur of the Convention of 1899 had emphasized the
necessity of this principle, presented by him as being ‘of the very essence of the arbitral
function and one of the inherent requirements for the exercise of this function’. This principle

has been frequently applied and at times expressly stated”.'*

2. The Tribunal recalls that the Hague Conventions referred to by the International Court of

Justice are the international treaties that established the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the
institution which administers the instant case. As it has been noted, Article 22.2 of the PPA
stipulates that “[iJf any dispute arises out of or in relation to this Agreement and if such dispute
cannot be settled through direct discussions of the Parties, the matter shall be referred to binding
arbitration at the Permanent Court of Arbitration . . . The Hague, The Netherlands . .
Applications may be made to such court for judicial recognition of the award and/or an order of
enforcement as the case may be. Arbitration shall be governed by and conducted in accordance
with UNCITRAL rules”,

The Parties have much relied in their pleadings on Born’s writings on international commercial
arbitration, Born notes that “[t]he competence-competence doctrine is almost universally

accepted in international arbitration conventions, national legislation, judicial decisions,

Lord Chancellor Loughborough, 13 April 1797, reported in J. B. Moore, History and Digest of the
International Arbitrations to which the United States Has Been a Party (1898), p. 327.

institutional rules and international arbitral awards. Authority in each of these sources
recognizes with relative unanimity some version of a competence-competence doctrine. As a

consequence, the basic proposition that an international arbitral tribunal presumptively

 

possesses jurisdiction to consider and decide upon its own jurisdiction can be considered a
universally recognized principle of international arbitration law. That is confirmed by the le
almost complete absence of any authority denying the competence-competence of arbitral

tribunals to consider and decide jurisdictional challenges, subject to subsequent judicial |

review”.'°

104, The Parties’ explicit choice in Article 22.2 of the PPA—that arbitration would be governed by
the UNCITRAL Rules—also leads this Tribunal to examine the applicable provisions of the
UNCITRAL Rules. Article 21 provides: “1. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on
objections that it has no jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or
validity of the arbitration clause . . . . 2. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to determine

the existence or the validity of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the

 

purposes of Article 21, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract and which provides
for arbitration under these Rules shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms
of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not

entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause”.

 

105. Furthermore, Article 22.2 of the PPA establishes a connection with the Netherlands and thus
with Dutch law. Article 1052(1) of the DCCP has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal
insofar as it reflects the competence-competence principle in unequivocal terms: “The arbitral
tribunal shall have the power to decide on its own jurisdiction”. The same principle is reflected

in Ghanaian legislation as contained in the GADRA.'*

106. The second basic principle which sets the legal framework for this Tribunal’s decision on the
issue of jurisdiction is the principle of separability—or severability or autonomy—of the
arbitration clause of a contract from the contract of which that clause forms part. This principle
is encapsulated in the last two sentences of the foregoing paragraph 2 of Article 21 of the
UNCITRAL Rules. i

107. How and to what extent separability is recognized in international arbitration and practice is
again well explained by Born: “a recurrent and virtually universal theme in national arbitration

legislation, judicial decisions and arbitral awards, across common law, civil law and other legal

‘6s Gary B. Born, International Commercial Arbitration (2009), Vol. 1, pp. 855-856.

 

In this regard, the Respondent observes in its Reply Brief, at 12, that the GADRA provides “as a general
rule, that the Tribunal has the power to rule on objections to its jurisdiction, including any objections with
respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration clause”.

systems, has been that arbitration agreements may be—and presumptively are intended by their

parties to be—separable from the underlying contracts with which they are associated . .. . The
breadth and i y of the of the i

 

the presumptions’s universal and enduring character”.'*”

The Tribunal will return to this principle in connection with the validity of the arbitration
agreement to be discussed below. At this point, however, it should be noted that even where
Ghanaian law applies to the PPA, this is not necessarily so in respect of the PPA’s arbitration
clause as the Respondent maintains. In fact, as noted above, the Respondent believes that
Ghanaian law should be applied to the arbitration clause because the Parties specifically
subjected the PPA to the laws of Ghana, and the default position in international arbitration is
that a choice of law provision in the main contract also applies to its arbitration clause.
However, in the light of the provisions of numerous arbitration rules and the consistent practice
in support of the principle of separability, Born’s conclusion is that the opposite seems to be the

correct presumption.

The Tribunal also observes that the Respondent accepts that a challenge to the existence,
validity or legality of the underlying contract will not necessarily affect the validity of the
arbitration agreement under the doctrine of separability, and that consequently the arbitration
clause need not be invalid simply “because” of the invalidity of the underlying contract. But
while it appears that the Respondent recognizes the principle of separability to this extent, the
Respondent nevertheless asserts that the same law that applies to the validity of the underlying
contract may also apply to the arbitration agreement and may independently render the

arbitration agreement invalid.’

Although this argument is no doubt ingenious it does not appear to take account of the fact, as
will be discussed in greater detail in the next section, that the law applicable to the underlying
contract could be different from the law applicable to the arbitration agreement and that, where
this is the case, the validity of the arbitration clause will need to be decided by reference to a set
of rules that may be wholly different from those to be applied to the underlying contract. In
addition, the argument leads to the conclusion that, while the Respondent appears to be
accepting the principle of separability in theory, in practice it is claiming that the arbitration

agreement should still follow the fate of the underlying contract.

Instead, by virtue of the principle of separability, even if the Respondent’s contentions that the

PPA is void ab initio were sustainable, and if they were to be sustained, whether by the Ghana

Supreme Court or by another Ghanaian judicial body or by this Tribunal, the arbitral clause of
the PPA could remain valid and in force. Thus, the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to take
decisions, for example, regarding the consequences arising from invalidity of the PPA or on
other matters unconnected to the objections to the validity of that contract would not be affected

by any such hypothetical determination.

112. The issues of the substantive validity of the PPA under the Constitution of Ghana and its
consequences for the rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to their contractual
undertakings are, in essence, questions pertaining to the merits of the dispute, and they do not
affect the validity or otherwise of the arbitration agreement. The Claimant has rightly argued in
this connection that the principle of objective arbitrability, as invoked by the Respondent, would
shift the focus of the issues to be decided by the Tribunal from the merits of the dispute to the
arbitration agreement itself and this would in effect deny the application of the principle of
competence-competence. As indicated above, the Tribunal is not deciding any question
pertaining to the merits at this stage. It will, however, examine below the question of objective
arbitrability discussed by the Parties.

113. The Parties have also discussed the meaning of the New York Convention in the context of the
issue of competence-competence. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's contention that
the application of the New York Convention may eventually lead to conflicting decisions on

enforcement in different jurisdictions; but the Tribunal also notes that it is a fundamental

 

principle of international arbitration that a tribunal should attempt to render an enforceable
award. In any case, it is one thing to assert that when an issue of the enforcement of an award
arises in Ghana, the Ghanaian courts will apply their own law based on which court has the
authority to interpret the Constitution, but it is quite another matter to conclude from this that
the Tribunal should, therefore, abstain from exercising its own jurisdiction, That national courts
in the country of the seat of the arbitration, or in States in which enforcement of the arbitral
award is sought, may exercise appropriate judicial review is unquestioned, but that does not

detract from this Tribunal’s duties and powers to pass upon its own jurisdiction.

114. The New York Convention does not expressly treat competence-competence (or separability).
Nothing in the Convention expressly requires (or debars) application of those established
doctrines. But, as Born points out, Articles 1I(3) and V(1) of the Convention recognize that both
arbitral tribunals and courts may consider and decide disputes about the arbitrators’ jurisdiction.
Articles V(1)(a) and V(1)(c) of the Convention contemplate that an arbitral tribunal may have
made an award notwithstanding jurisdictional objections and will have addressed issues of the
validity of the arbitration agreement. The fact that such determinations are subject to judicial

review, as at the stage of enforcement, has as its premise that arbitral tribunals are entitled to

pass upon their jurisdiction without prior judicial determination." The Tribunal will consider

other pertinent aspects of the meaning of the New York Convention further below.

115. The principles of competence-competence and separability, as embodied in Dutch and

Ghanaian legislation, in Article 21 of the governing UNICTRAL Rules and in international

arbitral conventions and international arbitral jurisprudence, practice and the opi

 

ion of

qualified commentators, provide the legal authority for this Tribunal to decide on its own

jurisdiction. Above all, this Tribunal is not free to leave aside the UNCITRAL Rules, which the

Parties have freely selected to govern the conduct of the arbitration. The Respondent does not

appear to deny this conclusion but only to suggest that, as a matter of practical convenience,

deference should be accorded to Ghanaian courts for the resolution of the threshold

constitutional issue identified. This is a separate matter that the Tribunal will discuss below.

B. The issue of the validity of the PPA and the Parties’ obligations under the
Agreement to Arbitrate in respect of the current proceedings.

 

The Respondent's arguments

116. As noted above, the Respondent contends that the conclusion of both the PPA and the
arbitration clause contained therein raises “serious questions” as to their validity under the
Ghanaian Constitution. Specifically, the Respondent disputes the Claimant’s contention that
Parliamentary approval was not required for the agreements because they were concluded with
a local Ghanaian entity. In the Respondent’s view, whether an agreement is an “international
business or economic transaction” is not determined solely by the contracting party’s state of
incorporation, but also by reference to the substance of the transaction.'” Indeed, the
contracting party’s state of incorporation is only one of many factors that are relevant to the
question whether a transaction is international in nature. The Respondent asserts that this latter
statement is particularly true where, as here, the Claimant appears to have been incorporated
just days before the conclusion of the PPA; the Respondent, in fact, suggests that local
incorporation may have been undertaken in an attempt to circumvent Article 181(5).'’' The
Respondent further refers to commentary on the Article’s legislative history, which observes
that approval is required for transactions with a “foreign company, firm or transnational

corporation,” a description which it asserts fits the Claimant.'”?

The Respondent suggests that
the interconnected web of affiliated companies known as the Balkan Group is controlled and
operated from the United States, and that the Balkan entities are treated as mere departments or
agents of one another. In this regard, the Respondent refers to several examples, including the
execution by Balkan US, rather than by the Claimant, of a subcontract for refurbishing work to
be done on the Barge, as well as the threat by Balkan UK to institute a BIT arbitration against
the Respondent arising out of the same acts and injuries alleged ia the instant dispute. For all of
these reasons, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant is not an independent company, but
is instead part of a larger multinational corporation, on which the Claimant relies for the
finances and management of its operations, and to which it defers to enter into contracts on its

behalf.”

“appears to disguise its operations through the use of fictitious entities”. In this regard, the Respondent
refers to the Memorandum of Understanding entered into between Balkan US and the Government of
Ghana, as well as to the Claimant's recent filings in the Ghana High Court, in both of which Balkan US is
represented as a “private corporation duly organized and existing under the law of the Netherlands”. The

Interim Award
22 December 2010
The Respondent maintains that both the PPA and the arbitration clause are “international
business or economic transaction{s],” and are therefore void and unenforceable for lack of prior
Parliamentary approval. In this regard, the Respondent contends that business transactions often
involve several elements of either a local or international character “which cannot be
meaningfully separated for purposes of parliamentary scrutiny”.'* To support its contention
regarding the “international character” of the PPA, the Respondent refers to foreign ownership,
management, and control of the Claimant; the signing of a subcontract between Balkan US and
a subcontractor for work to be done on the Barge; and several “international” provisions in the
Ppa,”

As for the arbitration clause, the Respondent argues that “there is no serious question” that it is
“substantively international in nature”.'"° The Respondent notes that the agreement provides for
international arbitration before an international tribunal, using international rules of arbitration
adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in the context of international commercial relations. The
Respondent further refers to the foreign and commercial nature of any award that would be
rendered, whether under the New York Convention or the GADRA, and asserts that, in essence,
the agreement subjects the Respondent to foreign liability before a foreign tibunal.'”” The
Respondent further asserts that the clause is properly defined as a “transaction” between the
Parties because it concerns or affects their material resources or welfare, and because
international arbitration is generally recognized to involve and to represent significant

commercial business interests.’

The Respondent objects to the Claimant’s characterization of
the arbitration clause as solely a “procedural” clause, and argues that, in any event, this position
undermines the Claimant’s argument that international public policy should be applied to

“correct” the application of Ghanaian law to the clause.'”

The Respondent suggests that the context and intent of Article 181(5) further underscore its

applicability to the arbitration clause. In this regard, the Respondent asserts that other provisions

in Article 181 require Parliamentary approval of all loans made by the Government of Ghana, in
order to check Executive authority to enter into agreements directly affecting public finances. In
the Respondent’s view, Article 181(5) extends this restraint to all international business and
economic transactions, in order both to protect against foreign exploitation and to ensure that
Ghana is not subjected to foreign liabilities without careful Parliamentary review. The
Respondent argues that the Claimant's position that Ghanaian law does not apply to the
arbitration clause, and that the Ghanaian Executive agreed to waive Ghanaian law, precisely

180

highlights the public policy objective in Article 181(5).

120. The Respondent disputes that it is estopped from asserting that the PPA is void ab initio, The
Respondent refers to the Ghana Supreme Court’s decisions in Faroe Atlantic and in other cases
for the proposition that principles of estoppel do not apply to, and cannot render enforceable, a
contract that is unconstitutional.'*' It suggests that the Claimant was not justified in relying on
the opinion of the prior Attorney-General, both because these precedents were well-established
in Ghana, and because the law of England and of the United States, which are home,
respectively, to the Claimant’s sole shareholder and to the Claimant’s ultimate parent company,
are in accord. In the Respondent’s view, the laws of all three legal systems hold that a legal
opinion of a government official cannot give rise to an estoppel defence or to a claim of
reasonable reliance, and that a party that relies on such opinion assumes the risk that it was
made in error. Thus, the Respondent denies that the Claimant is entitled to claim that the
opinions of the previous Attorney-General can have the effect of excluding the PPA and the

arbitration clause from legal review.'?

It maintains that, in any event, the purpose of Article
181(5) is to serve as a check on the Ghanaian Executive; and that while, the previous Attorney-
General may have expressed his views, the issue remains for the Ghana Supreme Court to

183

decide finally.’ The Respondent further suggests that the Claimant may have used fraudulent

84

representations to induce it to enter the PPA." The Respondent asserts that the delay in raising

its constitutional objection resulted from its good-faith attempts to resolve the dispute through

negotiation with the Claimant.'**

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s characterization of the constitutionality of the
arbitration agreement as being a matter of subjective arbitrability or of capacity. In the
Respondent’s view, it may clearly enter an arbitration agreement, provided that it does so in
compliance with the Constitution. The threshold issues are rather, first, the substantive validity
of the arbitration agreement under Ghanaian law, in other words whether an agreement ever
came into existence or whether the PPA is void ab initio because it did not receive the required
Parliamentary approval, and second, whether, as a matter of objective arbitrability, only the
Ghana Supreme Court may interpret Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution and its

applicability to the agreement.'*°

The Respondent maintains, further, that even if the Claimant's
characterization of the constitutional issue is accepted, capacity is determined by the law of the

place of incorporation—which is Ghana.'*”

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s suggestion that Ghanaian law that would invalidate the
agreements may be set aside through “the application of a direct rule of arbitration law, public
policy or international law, or by means of correction of the applicable national law of
Ghana”.'** In this respect, the Respondent disputes that there is a rule of substantive
international law, as alleged by the Claimant, that a State may not invoke its own law to deny
capacity, Rather, the Respondent asserts that there are many commonly accepted restrictions on
a State’s power to enter into an arbitration agreement.'” The Respondent further distinguishes
the present dispute from those referred to by the authorities cited by the Claimant, in that these
authorities refer to narrow national legislation strictly limiting Executive authority to enter into
arbitration agreements specifically, which served as specific defences to arbitration clauses. By
contrast, the Respondent contends that broad-based laws targeting all types of contracts and
which are borne out of legitimate policy concerns, such as Article 181(5), are permitted under

the New York Convention and will not be set aside.'"°

Finally, the Respondent disputes the Claimant's reliance on the Dutch Supreme Court case of
Defence Industries Organisation of the Ministry of Defence and Support for the Armed Forces
of the Islamic Republic of Iran (DIO) v. International Military Services Limited (IMS) for the

proposition that Ghanaian law may be set aside. The Respondent asserts that D/O v. IMS merely

prevents a State from relying on its own laws to invalidate an arbitration agreement with a
foreign entity where the place of performance is outside that State. In the Respondent’s view.
the rule does not apply where, as here, the place of incorporation and the place of the agreement
are within the State, nor does the Court’s decision provide authority for the broad proposition
that public international law should trump Ghanaian Jaw.'*' For similar reasons, the Respondent
further asserts that the Claimant may not avail itself of a good faith defence grounded in D/O.
In the Respondent’s view, unlike the foreign entity in D/O that had no reason to know that the
State in which it was situated and with which it was contracting had a law prohibiting it from
entering into an arbitration agreement, in this dispute, the Claimant is incorporated in Ghana
and was aware of Article 181(5). Moreover, the Respondent suggests that the opinion of the
Attommey-General of Ghana, on which the Claimant purports to have relied, was procured by the
Claimant’s own fraudulent representations and, in any event, cannot constitute a waiver of a

constitutional mandate.'”?

124, Finally with regard to the setting aside of Ghanaian law in favour of international legal
principles, the Respondent contends that, if the Tribunal were to follow this approach, it would
be required to take into account the international public policy interests of developing nations,
such as Ghana, whose governments must often undertake commercial transactions due to the
paucity of viable private entities. In the Respondent's view, Ghana’s interest in maintaining the
integrity of its Constitution and of its laws should therefore be treated as paramount.'**

The Claimant’s arguments

125. The Claimant maintains that the PPA is valid under Ghanaian law, applicable as provided for in
paragraph 23 of the PPA, because it is an agreement in writing that has been duly signed by
both Parties and that has been in full legal operation for more than three years.’ In the
Claimant’s view, the PPA required no Parliamentary or other approval, as expressed in the
opinions by the Attorney-General, and no intervening change in the law has rendered it
invalid.'* The Claimant maintains that the PPA is not an international business or economic

transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5), but rather is a valid contract between the

Respondent and itself.'°© The Claimant contends that it is a corporate citizen of Ghana,

‘operating as a business in its place of incorporation and abiding by Ghanaian law.'"”

26. In any event, the Claimant contends, the Respondent is now estopped from relying on Article

181(5) to contest the validity of the PPA.'°* The Claimant maintains that it was and is entitled to
rely on the Respondent’s representations that the PPA, and in consequence the arbitration
clause, were valid, binding, and constitutional. It asserts that these representations were made to
it in at least three ways: first, by the Respondent’s provision to the Claimant of the written legal
opinion of the Attommey-General of Ghana, which made the clear and unequivocal finding that
Article 181(5) did not apply to the PPA, and that the Respondent had the full power to enter into
the PPA; second, by the Respondent’s position, altered only recently, that the PPA was a valid
and binding agreement to which it willingly and conscientiously entered; and, third, by the
Respondent’s own earlier invocations of the arbitration agreement.'” The Claimant asserts that
neither a change in personnel nor a change in government for the Respondent affects the
applicability of the estoppel or good faith doctrines; rather, the acts of previous public servants
200

remain attributable to the Respondent.’ The Claimant suggests that, until recently, the

Respondent consistently invoked provisions of the PPA when advantageous to itself."

‘The Claimant further relies on established international law principles of good faith, prohibition
of inconsistent behavior, and prohibition of going against one’s own previous conduct. In these
regards, the Claimant refers to the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial
Contracts of 2004, as well as to Lex Mercatoria principles, rules, and standards. It argues that,
in particular, the prohibition of inconsistent behavior is regularly applied by arbitral tribunals as
a general principle of international law, and it refers to several arbitral awards in which
tribunals ruled against State actions that were, in its view, analogous to the Respondent’s

202

actions here."” Applying the concept to the present circumstances, the Claimant contends that

the Respondent cannot now, more thai three years after signing the PPA, assert that the validity

of the PPA and the arbitration clause are affected by Article 181(5). It maintains that any

representations to indicate that the agreements had been validly concluded and that they

, that it sought and received all reasonable and necessary assurances that the

 

PPA was valid; that no change justifies the Respondent’s change of position; and that the

Claimant reasonably relied on the Respondent’s representations in entering into and continuing

performance under the PPA.”

128. The Claimant further maintains that, under the principle of separability, even if the PPA is not
valid, the Arbitral Tribunal may consider the arbitration clause as a separate agreement.” In
this respect, the Claimant refers to Article 1053 of the DCCP and to Article 21(2) of the
UNCITRAL Rules.’ The Claimant argues that the separabi

  

ity principle is so widely

recognized that it has become one of the general principles of arbitration.”

129, The Claimant maintains that the question of the validity of the arbitration agreement is distinct
from the objective arbitrability of the subject matters in dispute, discussed above. In the
Claimant’ s view, the validity of the arbitration agreement is determined by Dutch law, including
Dutch procedural Jaw related to arbitration and Dutch substantive contract law.°°’ The Claimant
submits that Articles 1020 and 1021 of the DCCP set out the formal requirements for the
validity of arbitration agreements.” In the Claimant’s view, Article 22.2 of the PPA fulfils the
requirements under Dutch law for formal validity of the arbitration clause, because the Parties

agreed in writing to submit all disputes arising out of or in relation to the PPA to binding

arbitration.” The Claimant submits that Article 22.2 of the PPA also meets the requirements of

formal validity set out in Article H(2) of the New York Convention.”"”

As for the ive contract law i to the arbitrati the Claimant notes

 

that the Parties have not expressly agreed on the governing law, In such situations, the Claimant
suggests, it is common for arbitral tribunals to refuse to apply the general choice-of-law clause
in the main contract to the arbitration agreement, especially where the Parties’ chosen law
would invalidate the arbitration clause.?"' In this respect, the Claimant urges that the Tribunal
may refuse to apply the choice-of-law clause to the arbitration clause because Ghanaian law
discriminates between national and international transactions to which Ghana is a party and

thwarts the Parties’ true intentions to arbitrate.”!?

However, should the Tribunal wish to proceed instead by applying conflict of laws rules, the
Claimant asserts that the conflict of law rules of the seat of arbitration should be applied in
determining the substantive law applicable to an arbitration agreement.’'? Under Dutch conflict
of law rules, the Claimant asserts that the substantive contract law governing the arbitration
agreement is either the law chosen by the Parties, or the law most closely connected to the
arbitration agreement.”"* In the Claimant’s view, following the “validation principle,” the
Parties may be said to have impliedly chosen the law that will validate the arbitration
agreement.”"* In addition, with respect to the law most closely connected to the arbitration, the
Claimant argues that the general position under Dutch Jaw is that the law of the seat of
arbitration is the law most closely connected to the arbitration agreement. Moreover, the

Claimant asserts that “the parties’ explicit choice for The Netherlands as the seat isa

 

deliberate selection of a neutral forum in order to disassociate the dispute resolution process
from the host state’s laws and courts”.?'° Thus, under the Claimant’s view, both tests—Party

choice and closest connection—favour the application of Dutch contract law to the PPA’s

arbitration clause.”"’ The Claimant argues that, under the New York Convention, the analysis is

similar and the outcome identical.”'*

132. Applying Dutch substantive contract law to Article 22.2 of the PPA, the Claimant argues that

 

the Respondent has raised no contractual defences to its validity, and that the signatures at the
bottom of the PPA are proof of the Parties’ agreement to enter into the PPA and into the
arbitration agreement!” Should the Tribunal apply Ghanaian Jaw instead, the Claimant
maintains that the same conclusion is reached. However, if Ghanaian law invalidates the
arbitration agreement, the Claimant refers again to the validation principle to suggest that Dutch

contract law should be applied instead.”

It is the Claimant’s position that the Respondent’s “constitutional defence” is most accurately
characterized not as a contractual defence, but rather as a matter of subjective arbitrability. That
is, the Claimant views the Respondent as asserting that it is prohibited from entering into certain
agreements as a matter of public policy.”' According to the Claimant, subjective arbitrability is
subject to international public policy, as well as to the application of a substantive rule of
international law, and is out of reach of national law.” The Claimant asserts that the
Respondent is attempting to rely on its own domestic laws to invalidate an arbitration
agreement to which it previously acceded. In this regard, the Claimant refers to the
Respondent’s previous actions of representing, in negotiations, that Article 181(5) did not apply
to the PPA; providing a legal opinion from its Attorney-General to the same effect, clearly
stating that, under Faroe Atlantic, the project between the Government of Ghana and a locally-
incorporated company did not come within the ambit of Article 181(5); and invoking the
arbitration clause in correspondence with the Claimant?” The Claimant maintains that Dutch
law and international law and international public policy do not permit the Respondent to rely
on its own domestic laws to escape the application of an otherwise valid arbitration agreement.

In this regard, the Claimant refers to “consistent” case law and doctrine,” and adds that arbitral

awards have also been “remarkably consistent” on this issue.” The Claimant also refers to the
Dutch Supreme Court case of DIJO v. IMS, which, in its view, held that Dutch private
international law does not allow States to rely on limitations of capacity or authority of which
the other contracting party was not and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware.””°
The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s argument that D/O requires, for its application, that the
contracting party be incorporated outside the offending State. Instead, the case requires only
that the contracting party had no reason to be familiar with the offending State’s lack of
authority, perhaps because the State entity gave no indication about any limitations, and that the
transaction was international in fact.”?”
Indeed, in the Claimant’s view, conduct such as the Respondent's in the present arbitration is a
of ry concern to arbitrati iti The Claimant asserts that
anti-arbitration injunctions are rarely meritorious; constitute a threat to the good practice of
arbitration; and are at odds with the system of the New York Convention.”* In the Claimant’s
view, therefore, to the extent that Article 181(S) of the Ghanaian Constitution applies and limits
the effectiveness of the arbitration clause, the Tribunal may override it by applying the rules of

international law and international public policy discussed.””

. The Claimant further contends that, had the Respondent harboured genuine concern regarding

the constitutionality of the agreements and the efficiency of the resolution of the dispute
between the Parties, it should have first raised its jurisdictional objections before the Tribunal,
rather than seeking to block proceedings via recourse to its own judicial system?” It further
disputes the Respondent's claim that the proceedings in Ghana may be concluded within six to
eight months.” In addition, the Claimant contests the Respondent's invocation of international
comity, and notes that the Respondent sought the injunction six months after service of the

136. The Claimant maintains that, regardless of whether the Respondent’s constitutional argument is
characterized as a matter of lack of capacity or objective arbitrability, following the validation
principle, Dutch law should be applied.’ However, in the view of the Claimant, even if
Ghanaian law were to apply, the arbitration clause is not an international business or economic

ction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution. Specifically, the

 

Claimant refers to the Ghanaian Companies Code, 1963 (Act 169), which, in its view, provides
that a company’s nationality is determined on the basis of its State of incorporation.”™ The
Claimant refers also to the decision of the Ghana Supreme Court in Faroe Atlantic to support
the proposition that an international business or economic transaction is one between the

*5 In the Claimant’s view,

Government of Ghana and a company incorporated outside of Ghana.
under Ghanaian law, BEC retains its Ghanaian nationality, despite sole ownership by a foreign
corporation, Balkan UK. In this regard, the Claimant asserts that the Balkan Group of
companies follows a structure seen commonly around the world, in which legally distinct
entities form part of a common cluster, but operate in different countries with their own distinct
tasks, privileges, and liabilities. The Claimant asserts, in particular, that BEC does not share any
common directors with Balkan UK; that one of its own directors is a Ghanaian citizen; and that
it is, in all practical aspects, a stand-alone company. The Claimant reiterates that it is
incorporated in Ghana, undertakes its business activities in Ghana, has entered contracts for
local Ghanaian services and supplies, has employed hundreds of Ghanaian staff over the last
three years, pays taxes in Ghana, and complies with Ghanaian law.° However, should the
Tribunal instead find that Article 181(5) of the Ghana Constitution applies because the
arbitration clause is an international agreement, the Claimant argues that application of that
Article should be restrained in the present case by the rules of international public policy

described above,”*” as well as by the principles of good faith and estoppel.”**

Finally, the Claimant disputes that the arbitration clause is an economic or business transaction

at all. In the Claimant’s view, under Dutch law, an arbitration agreement is a mixed obligatory

and procedural agreement, not an economic or business transaction.” The Claimant notes also
that neither the GADRA nor the Ghanaian Arbitration Act, 1961 (Act 38) characterizes an
arbitration agreement as a business or economic transaction, and that there is no specific
requirement under the Ghanaian Constitution for Parliamentary approval of arbitration
agreements.“° The Claimant further argues that, even if the arbitration agreement has
international components, there is no commercial, business, or economic content to it. The
Claimant suggests that, if commercial content were not a condition for an agreement to come
within the scope of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, any dispute resolution clause
involving international arbitral tribunals to which the Government of Ghana is a party would

require Parliamentary approval.

The Tribunal’s findings

138.

139.

240

The Tribunal is mindful of the Respondent’s argument to the effect that, even if the Tribunal
finds that it has jurisdiction on the basis of the competence-competence principle, it will still
have to contend at some point with the threshold constitutional issue that has been raised about
the validity of the PPA with reference to Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution and the
requirement for prior Parliamentary approval of the PPA. The Tribunal must emphasize in this

respect that the question of the substantive validity of the PPA is one to be decided on the

  

merits. Insofar as jurisdiction is concerned, the only pertinent question that the Tribunal must

decide at this stage is the validity or otherwise of the arbitration agreement.

Two issues are intertwined in the assessment of the validity of the arbitration agreement. The
first is whether it is permissible for a provision of the Ghanaian Constitution to be interpreted
by an entity other than the Ghana Supreme Court, such as this Tribunal. The issue is not, as the
Respondent has rightly pointed out, one of subjective arbitrability or capacity to enter into an
arbitration agreement as the Claimant appears to characterize the constitutional question raised.
The Tribunal considers that the Respondent has this capacity and that it has exercised it beyond
doubt. The second issue concerns whether any other legal provision or norm under the
applicable law invalidates the arbitration agreement, and the law that should apply in

determining that issue. The Tribunal will next examine these issues.

140, The Tribunal addresses, first, whether the question of the validity of the arbitration agreement—
and, thus, of the Tribunal’s competence—is objectively arbitrable. According to the
Respondent, doubts in this respect arise in view of the provision of Article 130 of the
Constitution of Ghana, pursuant to which the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction

“in all matters relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this Constitution,” and in view of
Article 1 of the GADRA, which it claims exempts from arbitration issues of “enforcement and

interpretation of the [Ghanaian] Constitution.”

141, The Tribunal commences its enquiry with Article 1020 of the DCCP (see Article 1073 of the
DCCP). Article 1020(3), cited by both Parties, provides that an arbitration agreement in
proceedings subject to the Dutch arbitration law “shall not serve to determine legal
consequences of which the parties cannot freely dispose”. An immediate next question is, of
course, which legal order is decisive for the judgment as to whether the parties can freely
dispose of certain matters in arbitration, While the Respondent has suggested that Article
1020(3) requires the interpreter to look to the legal order with the closest connection to the
dispute—an exercise that, in the Respondent's view, leads to the application of Ghanaian law—
the Claimant maintains that the /ex loci arbitri should be decisive in all but exceptional
circumstances.

142. In the present case, the Tribunal considers that there are strong arguments to be made in favour
of defining the scope of arbitrable matters in accordance with the lex loci arbitri. As explained
in further detail below, the Parties’ agreement to dispute settlement before the PCA is an
indicator that the Parties intended to remove questions relating to dispute resolution—as
opposed to the substantive performance of the contract—from the place of either Party, to a
neutral forum. However, the Tribunal need not reach any definitive conclusion in this respect,
as the Tribunal sees no reason, under Dutch or Ghanaian law, that constitutional provisions

should be inherently non-arbitrable.

143,

&

Arbitration tribunals are not infrequently confronted with the need to interpret and apply
constitutional provisions relevant to the resolution of disputes submitted to them, just as they
are normally required to interpret and apply treaties that are relevant to the disputes. There is
nothing abnormal in exercising a judicial function necessary for the proper administration of
justice. Hence the Tribunal does not consider that, in asserting its competence to determine its
jurisdiction in this case, it is disregarding or in any way contradicting the force of Article 130 of
the Constitution of Ghana. In the view of the Tribunal, the purpose of that provision, like
similar clauses in numerous other constitutions, is to establish the judicial supremacy of the
Supreme Court in the organization and allocation of powers in the domestic context of Ghana.
When there is a case that transcends national borders because of an arbitration agreement or

some other legal commitment, such a provision becomes qualified and not necessarily

predominant. Otherwise, as the Claimant has rightly noted, any dispute involving some element
of constitutional interpretation, or any dispute in which an objection is raised that there is such
an element, which is not difficult to do, would automatically be excluded from international
arbitration, in spite of the existence of a clear commitment by the Parties to subject the dispute

to arbitration.

. The Tribunal notes in this connection that, under Article 1020(3) of the DCCP, the arbitration

agreement “shall not serve to determine legal consequences of which the parties cannot freely
dispose”. There is here an explicit recognition that some matters may not be arbitrable by
reason of public policy considerations. Yet, as argued by the Claimant, a question of
constitutional interpretation—such as that raised by the Respondent—does not necessarily fall
within the public policy restriction in The Netherlands, because, if it did, any arbitration

agreement or contract which encounters an argument of constitutional nature in a foreign

 

country would be excluded from the jurisdiction of an arbitration tribunal to decide upon.

The same conclusion can be reached by reference to the provisions of the New York
Convention. Under Article 11(3) of the Convention, the court of a Contracting State seized of an
action arising from an arbitration agreement shall, at the request of a party, refer the matter to
arbitration “unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of
being performed”. However, this power to assess the agreement is available only to the court
that has been seized of the case, and not to any other court. This is also the case if the body
seized of the case is an arbitral tribunal. This is without prejudice to the right of a court in
Ghana to apply its own law when it is seized of an award at the stage of enforcement, including
the right to apply any relevant requirements of public policy, as provided for under Article
V(2)(a) of the Convention. However, this is not an impediment to an arbitral tribunal to decide
on its own competence or to make an award on a dispute submitted to it; nor does it affect the
powers of other courts that may be called upon to consider enforcement of, or a challenge to,
the award in a different country, Otherwise, the principle of competence-competence would be

meaningless and without effect.

The Parties are in dispute as to the law that should apply to the second issue noted, that is,
whether any other legal norm invalidates the arbitration agreement. Based on its argument of
Constitutional supremacy as noted above, the Respondent considers that only Ghanaian law,
and particularly the relevant provisions of the Ghanaian Constitution, should govern the validity
of the arbitration agreement. For its part the Claimant argues that the applicable law should be
the Dutch procedural law on arbitration as well as Dutch substantive contract law. In the view
of the Claimant, the arbitration agreement is valid under both sets of rules—a conclusion which

it maintains would not be different even if Ghanaian law were applied.

147. The Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that, from a purely procedural point of view, the
arbitration clause is valid both under the Netherlands Arbitration Act according to the DCCP,
just as it is valid under GADRA and the New York Convention, In fact, all of the requirements
for the formal validity of the arbitration clause are unquestionably met. The only problem arises
from the constitutional question raised under Ghanaian law, but, in the view of the Tribunal,
this is not connected to the formal validity of the clause as it concerns the question of objective
arbitrability, ie., whether the subject matter of the dispute is capable of being decided by
arbitration.

148. As to which law is applicable to the arbitration clause itself, the Parties, not surprisingly, also
have different views. According to the Respondent, it follows from the fact that the PPA is
governed by the law of Ghana, a matter which is not disputed by the Claimant, that this law
should also apply to the arbitration agreement contained in the PPA. To the contrary, the
Claimant contends that, since the PPA did not make an express choice of law in respect of the
arbitration agreement, the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the seat of arbitration,

in this case Dutch law.

149.

S

The Tribunal notes that the solutions reached by arbitral tribunals, and the views of writers on
this issue, differ, with some favouring the view that the arbitration agreement should follow the
choice of law applicable to the contract while some others favour the position that, in the
absence of express agreement, the applicable law should be that of the seat of arbitration.

However, the Tribunal is persuaded that, in deciding this issue, it should favour the approach

 

that is more conducive to making the arbitration agreement effective rather than an approach
that would render the agreement ineffective. The Parties agreed to an arbitration clause
providing for the resolution of disputes arising under the PPA by arbitration and it is this choice
that should prevail and not an interpretation the result of which would be the exact opposite. A
contract cannot be deemed to contain a clause which is self-defeating of its objectives. The
validation principle invoked by the Claimant lends support to the conclusion that it makes more
sense to consider that the Parties opted for an approach that would validate rather than render

invalid the arbitration agreement.

150. The solution to this issue is also not clear-cut by reference to conflict of law rules. The basic
tenet underlying the doctrine of lis pendens, however, points in the direction of finding in
favour of the law that is most closely connected to the arbitration agreement. In this case it is
the law of the Netherlands that appears to have the closest connection with the arbitration
agreement under the PPA. This is borne out by the fact that The Netherlands was chosen as the
seat of the arbitration and by the explicit decision to operate under the UNCITRAL Rules,
which, among other consequences, determines the courts which will be competent to consider

any challenge to the award rendered. More important still is the argument invoked by the

Claimant to the effect that the choice of the seat of the arbitration in a neutral country indicates
a clear understanding that the Parties wish to detach the arbitration agreement from the
domestic law or the courts of either Party. The situation is, of course, different with respect to
the law applicable to the PPA, since the PPA contains a choice of law provision that expressly

subjects the contract to Ghanaian law.

‘The Tribunal must emphasize that the New York Convention also supports the conclusion that,
in the absence of a choice of law provision in the arbitration agreement, the law of the seat of
arbitration should be the applicable law for determining the validity of the arbitration
agreement. Indeed, Article V(1)(a) of the Convention provides that an award may not be
recognized if the arbitration agreement was not valid under “the law to which the parties have
subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was

made”,

In the light of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the law applicable to the
arbitration agreement in the PPA is the law of The Netherlands. In so deciding, the Tribunal
wishes to state that this entails no disrespect for the laws of Ghana or of other developing
countries. The Tribunal is sensitive to the importance of according due respect to the laws of
every sovereign State; and it emphasizes that its decision in the present case is entirely unrelated
to any views or judgments regarding the merits of the respective legal systems. Rather, its
decision is based solely on its appreciation of which solution appears to be more appropriate for
the effective discharge of the dispute resolution functions which have been entrusted to it by the

agreement of the Parties themselves.

. Having reached the conclusion that its jurisdiction is supported by both the competence-

competence and the separability principles and that Dutch law properly applies to the validity of
the arbitration agreement, the Tribunal will now examine what Dutch law has to say in this
regard, As noted above, the Parties seem to agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that the arbitration
agreement meets the basic requirements of contract law and the DCCP. The only open question
is whether, under Dutch law, the constitutional provisions of a foreign State—in this case,
Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana—can constitute grounds for invalidating an
otherwise valid arbitration agreement.

As the Claimant has noted, the Respondent has not advanced any particular arguments to
demonstrate that Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana is relevant to the validity of the

arbitration agreement, if it is agreed that Dutch law is the governing law of the arbitration

** Instead, the Respondent has argued that Ghanaian law and not Dutch law should

apply in the first place and, for that reason, the Constitution of Ghana is directly pertinent.“ As
indicated above, the Tribunal’s conclusion is that the proper law governing the validity of the
arbitration agreement is Dutch law. Accordingly, taking account of the Parties’ submissions and
upon a careful review of the relevant Dutch law, the Tribunal does not consider that Article

181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana in any way affects the validity of the arbitration agreement.

155. The Claimant has argued in this respect that there is no such constitutional issue in view of the
fact that it was the Respondent who represented that Article 181(5) of the Constitution does not
apply to the PPA and provided the legal opinions of the Attorney-General to the effect that a
contract with a locally-incorporated company, such as BEC, is not affected by the requirement
of Parliamentary approval under that Article because the PPA is not an international business or
economic transaction. The Tribunal does not find this argument persuasive; and it finds that
there is indeed a constitutional issue here. In the view of the Tribunal, the very fact that the
Attorney-General had to issue an opinion on the subject indicates that there were questions in
this respect of which the Claimant was or should have been well aware at the time of

negotiation and conclusion of the PPA.

156. The Parties have also argued about the meaning of the 2005 decision of the Ghana Supreme
Court in Attorney General v. Faroe Atlantic, and particularly whether the judgment sufficiently
disposes of the constitutional issue raised. In view of the considerations set out above. the
Tribunal believes that this issue relates to the merits of the dispute. It is at that stage that the
Tribunal will wish the Parties to argue about whether it is only the place of incorporation that
should govern the resolution of the constitutional question discussed in Attorney General v.
Faroe Atlantic or whether consideration should also be given to the nature of the activities
undertaken under the contract. Such argument is particularly necessary because it is often the
case that international business transactions are carried out through a locally incorporated
company that acts as an intermediary. It is indeed the case here that BEC is the vehicle through
which the business of an international company was undertaken in Ghana. This is a question

that can only be answered in the light of the facts of the present case.

‘The Tribunal has taken due note of the Respondent's detailed argumentation regarding the question of
objective arbitrability, including arguments made under the assumption that Dutch law determines which
matters are capable of settlement through arbitration. The arguments on this point, however, must be
distinguished from the present question of the validity of the arbitration agreement, i.e., the question
whether there is a legally binding agreement to arbitrate in the first place.

As the Tribunal has noted, the Respondent has also argued that, as a matter of practicality, even should
the Tribunal find that the arbitration agreement is valid, jurisdiction should be refused, in order not
confront the question of the validity of the PPA, which the Parties agree is governed by Ghanaian law.

In this context it will also be appropriate for the Parties to discuss the legal and constitutional
effects of the requirement of local incorporation under the law of Ghana for the supply of bulk
energy in that country. As explained above, Article 12 of the Ghana Energy Commission Act of
1997 (Act 541) requires that, for a company to hold a license for bulk energy supply in Ghana,
it must be incorporated in Ghana. Because of this requirement BEC was registered under the

Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) of Ghana as a locally incorporated company.

  

Equally important will be the arguments concerning the legal opinions issued by the Attorney-
General, which appeared to state the Government's understanding about the legal requirements
to be observed for the award of the licence and the execution of the PPA, Whether such
opinions are the legal expression of a commitment that cannot later be denied, as the Claimant
maintains, or simply represent the erroneous opinion of a public official, as the Respondent
believes, it is a question to be examined on the merits in connection with the validity of the PPA

under both Ghanaian and international law as applicable to this arbitration.

While such considerations may be appropriate in respect of the validity of the PPA, the Tribunal
does not consider that they are pertinent to the issue of the validity of the arbitration agreement.
The Tribunal’s conclusion is that the validity of the arbitration agreement is not affected by
Article 181(5) of the Constitution. Under both Dutch law and Ghanaian legislation an
arbitration agreement cannot be considered to be an international business or economic
transaction, As argued by the Claimant, if the arbitration agreement is considered invalid, that
would mean that any international arbitration agreement to which the Government of Ghana is a
party would need to be submitted to Parliamentary approval. Separability acquires a particular

significance in this context.

The Claimant maintains that the Respondent is attempting to rely on its own domestic law to

 

invalidate an arbi to which it previously acceded and i an
approach that Dutch law and international law and international public policy do not permit.
The Tribunal, while accepting the force of this contention, does not accept the Claimant's

further contention that the Respondent has acted in bad faith.

The Parties have also discussed in this context the Dutch Appeals Court case of DIO y. IMS, but
have assigned to it interpretations that are of limited usefulness to the Tribunal in this case.
According to the Claimant, the decision of the Dutch Appeals Court supports the view that no
reliance should be placed on limitations on the authority of officials or agencies of which the
other contracting party was not aware, and could not reasonably have been expected to be
aware. However, the Tribunal must point out that, as has been noted above, in the present case
the Claimant was either aware or should have been aware of the possible legal difficulty arising

from Article 181(5) of the Constitution. For its part the Respondent maintains that, while the

decision in DIO v. IMS declares that a State is not entitled to rely on its own laws to invalidate
an arbitration agreement with a foreign entity, this applies only if the place of performance is
outside that State, but not if performance is to be within that State. It is not apparent to the
Tribunal that this

 

is a correct interpretation of the decision. In the view of the Tribunal, the
decision implies that reliance on internal law should not be permissible to invalidate an ut
arbitration agreement whether the place of performance is within or outside of the State, This is

the meaning of the general statement of the Appeals Court that: “The principle that a state or

 

organisation belonging to a state—such as DlIO—would not be entiled to argue that an
agreement it enters into providing for international arbitration is invalid under its own internal

99 245

laws, is by now a broadly supported international principle”.“” This conclusion is solidly based

on contemporary international precedent, as, for example, in the case of Benteler v. Belgium.“°

162.

8

The Tribunal will now consider the issue of estoppel raised by the Claimant in answer to the
Respondent's assertion that the PPA is void ab initio and this same consideration applies to the
arbitration agreement. There is no doubt that, in the instant case, there have been official
representations by the Government of Ghana on which the Claimant has relied. The Respondent
has suggested that the Claimant may have used fraudulent representations to induce it to enter I
the PPA and this would render any consideration of estoppel unwarranted. Here, too, the
Tribunal considers that the assertion entails a presumption of bad faith on the part of the
Claimant. The Tribunal is unable to endorse such a presumption in the absence of convincing

evidence to support it.

163.

S

While there may be valid reasons for the Ghanaian Constitution to impose restrictions on the
State’s powers to enter into certain kinds of international transactions, there are circumstances
where such a restriction cannot derogate from the effectiveness of the arbitration agreement to
which the Parties are committed and which has been held out as valid by the competent
Ghanaian officials. That is very much the case here. The very fact that the Respondent proposed
the alternative of arbitration to settle the dispute indicates that the arbitration agreement was
considered by it to be valid and in force, even if the Respondent ultimately decided not to
pursue this line of action.*7 Indeed, the Claimant has characterized the attitude of the

Respondent in this regard as evidence of inconsistent State behaviour.

. In any event, the Tribunal notes in this respect that, under the applicable principles of

international law, the decisions of government officials with apparent authority are attributable
to the State. The International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility have clearly
stated this principle in Article 7, with the added commentary that “[t}he State cannot take refuge
behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which
may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have

occurred or ought to have taken a different form”.

. Moreover, the approval of business transactions by government officials not objected to as to

their legality under local law, and relied upon for a number of years, have been held to amount
to estoppel by various arbitral tribunals.” Whether the situation in the instant case is held to
constitute estoppel or some other form of inconsistent behavior, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

under the arbitration agreement will not be affected.

Even if it were ultimately to be held on the merits that the PPA is invalid—as to which this
Tribunal now makes no holding—the arbitration clause will still serve an important purpose
because it would enable the Tribunal to take decisions on the consequences of such invalidity
for the obligations of the parties to the contract, including consequential questions relating to
damages and compensation. The Claimant also suggests that there are other questions, not
related to the constitutional issues raised, that would still have to be decided, such as unjust

enrichment, tort for negligent advice and liability for false representation.”*°

In the light of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the arbitration agreement
embodied in Article 22.2 of the PPA is both valid and enforceable independently from the issue
of the validity of the PPA, and that the Parties are bound by this commitment to international

arbitration.

Court’s jurisdiction. Therefore, the Respondent submits that, although the Tribunal itself is not

subject to the injunction, the Tribunal must “accord|] respect” to the injunction.”*!

169. The Respondent argues, further, that the Tribunal should accord respect to the Ghanaian
injunction because it rests on sound legal grounds. It contends that forcing the Respondent to i
participate in a matter not properly subject to arbitration constitutes per se irreparable harm. The
Respondent asserts that the Ghana High Court correctly assessed that the balance of harm falls
on the Respondent's side. The Respondent also contends that, rather than a “patently improper
or parochial court order by a rogue court,” the Ghana High Court Ruling was based on full
briefing and argumentation, was well-reasoned, and applied standards consistent with principles

used in common law nations and in rules of international arbitration.**

170. The Respondent argues that, therefore, the Tribunal should suspend proceedings, and should
defer to the injunction and to the Ghana Supreme Court’s forthcoming decision on the

arbitrability of the dispute.** The Respondent contends that decisions of arbitral tribunals and

 

decisions of national courts favour deference to a foreign court which is properly seized of the
question of arbitrability. In this respect, the Respondent refers to The MOX Plant Case, in

which the arbitral tribunal suspended its proceedings, in view of the prospect that the European

 

Court of Justice would be seized with a view to determining whether the relevant provisions of
the convention at issue were within the European Community's exclusive competence. The
Respondent argues that MOX Plant is directly in point and provides a sound basis for the
Tribunal to abstain from further proceedings at this stage. The Respondent notes that the Ghana
High Court has issued an interlocutory injunction specifically restraining the Claimant from
continuing with the proceedings before the Tribunal pending the determination of the Ghana

proceedings.°™

171.

The Respondent contends that, in light of the international law doctrines of lis pendens and
international comity, an arbitral tribunal has two options when confronting the challenge that a
matter before it is non-arbitrable: it may decide that it does not have competence to decide on
any of the matters submitted, or it may decide to retain jurisdiction on the matters that it finds to
be arbitrable but to suspend the proceedings on the other matters until] the question of the

arbitrability of the matters challenged has been decided by the competent court.** The

Respondent argues that determinative factors weigh in favour of suspension of the proceedings:
the first is that the question of constitutional interpretation raised before the Ghanaian courts is a
bona fide issue, and not just a pretext to frustrate arbitration, as alleged by the Claimant; and the
second is that the Ghana Supreme Court is the most appropriate forum for determination of the
constitutional issues, because that court has exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional questions,

and because the dispute raises fundamental questions with broad public policy implications.”*°

The Respondent asserts further that if the Tribunal continues the proceedings, it risks subjecting
the Parties to conflicting decisions or to inconsistent judgments. It refers to provisions in the
New York Convention that permit non-enforcement of awards that are based on invalid
arbitration agreements, or that decide matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.
Additionally, the Respondent submits that an arbitral award that violates a foreign court’s order
is itself contrary to public policy, for which enforcement may be refused.’ The Respondent
further argues that an order from the Tribunal directing the Parties to proceed would place the
Parties in the difficult position of having to choose between violating the Ghana High Court’s

injunction, or participating in the arbitral proceedings under protest.”**

The Respondent maintains that deference to the Ghanaian courts should not result in major
delay, and that the timing of the referral to the Ghana Supreme Court depended on the Claimant
submitting its Statement of Defence. The Respondent argues that it has every reason to have the
constitutional issue resolved promptly, as its interests are served neither by having the Barge in

continued disrepair, nor by uncertainty as to the proper interpretation of Article 181(5).°

Finally, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s insistence that the Tribunal should determine
the validity and enforceability of the PPA and of the arbitration clause, or to otherwise urge the
Tribunal to proceed with the arbitration, could constitute contempt of the Ghana High Court
Order. The Respondent contends that the intent and spirit of the injunction require that the
Respondent also refrain from arguing the merits of the constitutional issue before this Tribunal,
other than to urge the Tribunal to defer further proceedings pending the outcome in the Ghana

litigation.2°

The Claimant’s arguments
175. In the Claimant’s view, the proceedings in Ghana do not affect the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. j
The Claimant notes that the Notice of Arbitration was submitted on 23 December 2009, while

the request for an injunction was only made on 25 June 2010, that is, six months later. It also

points out that the Respondent reacted positively to the notice and responded by nominating an
arbitrator. According to the Claimant, the Tribunal was first seized of the dispute and it is,

261

therefore, the appropriate body to resolve it.°°’ The Claimant contends that the Respondent's

262

application for the injunction was not made in good faith,” and that the grounds relied on for

the injunction are without merit.

176. The Claimant also disputes that the Respondent will suffer any harm as a result of the
continuation of the arbitration. In particular, it points out that the Claimant did not in fact obtain
an ex parte attachment of all of the Respondent's bank accounts and property in the Netherlands
in February 2010. Rather, the Claimant states that it was merely granted leave to place
attachments—and on the Respondent’s bank accounts only—and that it was, in any event,
unable to make a successful attachment because none of the relevant accounts contained funds.

The Claimant also contests the Respondent's claim that it was not apprised of this attachment

 

until June 2010. Instead, the Claimant maintains that, consistently with Dutch law, the
Respondent was notified of the leave for attachments on 5 March 2010." Finally, the Claimant
asserts that, on 15 July 2010, it made a specific undertaking to the Ghana High Court that it i
would not seek any further conservatory attachments of any of Ghana's assets in any

jurisdiction pending the final determination of the arbitration.” |

177.

a

In addition to disputing the grounds on which the Respondent obtained the injunction against
the Claimant, the Claimant also maintains that the Ghana High Court Ruling of 6 September
2010 was legally incorrect. In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent cannot succeed on the
merits in the Ghanaian litigation, because, as discussed, the dispositive constitutional issue—the
definition of an “international business or economic transaction”—has already been decided by
the Ghana Supreme Court in Faroe Atlantic?® The Claimant argues that the Ghana High Court |

Constitution of Ghana, and whether the Tribunal will be bound by the orders of the Ghanaian

courts.°°°

The Claimant maintains that the injunction of the Ghana High Court contravenes fundamental
principles of i i law and ines the system of i i itration. In this
respect, it refers to the doctrines of competence-competence, party autonomy, and judicial
abstention until an award is rendered, as well as provisions of the New York Convention that it
interprets as prohibiting domestic courts from blocking arbitration.” The Claimant notes that,
by its terms, the Ghana High Court Order is addressed to the Claimant and not to the Tribunal.
In the Claimant's view, the Tribunal has not only the right but also an obligation, to proceed to
consider its own jurisdiction, and the Ghanaian courts are under an obligation to stay the
domestic court proceedings until the Tribunal has done so.” Finally, the Claimant highlights
the practical consequences for the system of arbitral dispute resolution if tribunals allow anti-
arbitration injunctions to interfere with proceedings.”

The Claimant disputes that The MOX Plant Case is analogous to the present dispute. The
Claimant distinguishes that case on the basis that, in MOX Plant, a strong possibility existed
that an exclusive competence over the dispute had been transferred to the European Community
under the European Community Treaty. In view of the initiation of proceedings at the European
Court of Justice, which would bind the parties and could preclude the jurisdiction of the MOX
Plant arbitral tribunal, the arbitral uibunal suspended its proceedings.”” By contrast, in the
present dispute, the Claimant contends that the Respondent has subjected itself to the New York
Convention, which leaves questions of arbitrability to be decided, first, by the arbitral
tribunal.” Moreover, in the Claimant's view, in contrast to the petitioner in MOX Plant, the
Respondent has not sought recourse in the proper forum, but instead has petitioned its own
judiciary in order to circumvent the correct processes and to obtain an almost certain favourable

180. The Claimant notes that the specter of conflicting decisions was only created as a result of the
Respondent’s initiation of proceedings in Ghana, despite the arbitration agreement and despite

the fact that this Tribunal had been duly appointed.’ The Claimant maintains that the
Respondent should have argued its position before the Tribunal and, in case of an unfavourable
decision, it could have then applied to the Dutch courts to set aside the arbitration proceedings.

In the current situation, the Claimant finds that the only correct solution is for the Respondent to
withdraw the Ghanaian court proceedings, rather than risk conflicting decisions.”” In any event,

the Claimant contends that the decisions of the Tribunal and of the Ghanaian courts will not in

fact conflict, because they will be grounded in different sets of law.”

181,

The Claimant suggests that the anti-arbitration injunction has restricted its ability to proceed in
the ordinary course with this arbitration, including inhibiting its ability to correspond fully and
freely with the Tribunal.’” The Claimant fears that it will be prosecuted for contempt of court
or will otherwise incur sanctions in Ghana, where its operations continue, as a result of making
submissions in these arbitral proceedings.””’ It notes that it has already defended in good faith
against the claims made by the Respondent in the proceedings in Ghana, but to no avail.”
Further, the Claimant draws the Tribunal’s attention to the fact that the Respondent has released
excerpts from at least one piece of correspondence to the Tribunal from the present confidential
arbitral proceedings relating to the instant dispute, in a seeming attempt to prejudice the Ghana

High Court against the Claimant.”

182. The Claimant submits that the Tribunal also has the power to issue an anti-suit injunction and to
order the Respondent to withdraw its requests currently before the Ghana High Court and to

refrain from initiating any further court proceedings in Ghana or elsewhere.” It argues that a

The Tribunal has stated above that it accords the greatest respect to the decisions of the
Ghanaian courts and to the legal system of Ghana as a whole. As also indicated above, the
Tribunal has declined to issue an anti-suit injunction against the Respondent, as requested by
the Claimant.

However, the submission of the Respondent that the Tribunal should defer to the courts of

Ghana is a different proposition. In the discussions above regarding the validity of the

 

arbitration agreement and the obligation of the Parties to abide by it, the Tribunal has clearly set
out its understanding as to the law applicable to these questions, including the meaning of the
relevant Dutch and Ghanaian law and the proper purport of the New York Convention, It is in
the light of this understanding that the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that it has

jurisdiction to decide the dispute submitted to it by the Parties.

 

relied heavily on The MOX Plant Case to support its request for
postponement of the proceedings pending determination of the suits before the courts in Ghana,
while the Claimant has argued against such postponement on the grounds that the MOX Plant
case should be distinguished from the present dispute. The Tribunal believes that the situation
and the legal context in the MOX Plant Case are different from those in the present case. In the
MOX Plant Case, the major issue in question was the significance of Article 282 of the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in resolving the difference between the parties
regarding the competing jurisdictions of the Annex VII arbitral tribunal and the European Court
of Justice over the issues in dispute. Article 282 of the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea excludes the jurisdiction of the Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal “if the parties in the
dispute have agreed . . . that such dispute shall be submitted to another procedure that entails a
binding decision”.

Both of the parties in the MOX Plant arbitration, Ireland and the United Kingdom, are parties to
the European Community Treaty, Article 292 of which gives exclusive jurisdiction to the
European Court of Justice in disputes between Member States concerning the application or
interpretation of Community law. Further, in the context of the European Community, now the
European Union, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a “mixed agreement,”
because the European Community is a party to the Convention in its own right and in respect of

matters for which responsibility has been transferred to the Community, including matters

concerning the protection of the marine environment, maritime safety, and fisheries. It was
claimed by the European Commission that a significant part of the dispute between Ireland and
the United Kingdom relates to provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea that were part of Community law and, accordingly, that the application or interpretation of
those provisions fell within the “jurisdictional monopoly” of the European Court of Justice. The
Annex VII arbitral tribunal agreed that, to the extent that this is so, its jurisdiction would be
precluded by virtue of Article 282 of the Convention, and the dispute settlement procedures
under the European Community Treaty would prevail in its place. In the circumstances, the
arbitral tribunal considered it appropriate to adjourn its proceedings to allow for the

jurisdictional issues to be definitely resolved. The arbitral tribunal believed that, without this,

 

substantial doubts would remain as to whether its jurisdiction could “be firmly established in

respect of all or any of the claims in the dispute”.”*?

187. In the present case, the Tribunal does not have any doubts as to its jurisdiction under the

arbitration agreement concluded between the Claimant and the Respondent. This will be so

 

irrespective of the decision that may be reached in the Ghanaian courts regarding the validity or

 

enforceability of the PPA. As explained above, the issue of the validity or enforceability of the a

PPA relates to the merits of the dispute and has no influence on the validity of the arbitration

 

agreement between the Parties or on the competence of the Tribunal to exercise the functions

entrusted to it under the agreement.

 

188. The Tribunal must also consider in this context the Respondent's argument to the effect that f
participation in a matter which it regards as not properly subject to arbitration constitutes per se
irreparable harm. Arbitral jurisprudence and the opinions of writers on the subject indicate that

*5 This is even more so when

the question of what constitutes irreparable harm is a difficult one.
the argument concerns an intangible interest such as the right not to be subjected to
inappropriate arbitration. However, it appears to have been well established that harm will only
be irreparable when compensation cannot be made available as a remedy.” In the instant case
it is not easy to foresee how damage could ensue from the exercise by the Tribunal of its legal

function under the arbitration agreement. And to the extent that some damage might ensue, it

must be asked why any such damage should not be capable of being compensated by the
exercise of the powers that a tribunal always has, including the power to award costs. The
suggestion of the Respondent that the Tribunal might undertake a “balance of harm” between
the Parties does not appear appropriate in this context, in the light of the commitment of both

Parties to resolve any dispute under the PPA by arbitration.

With respect to the risk of conflicting decisions or inconsistent judgments that has been raised
by the Parties, the Tribunal’s view is that an award will always be potentially subject to a
challenge either before the courts of the seat of arbitration or at the enforcement stage before the
courts of the place of enforcement, including in this case the courts of Ghana. That is the
appropriate moment for applying any controls based on issues of public policy, to the extent

permissible under the UNCITRAL Rules and the New York Convention.

‘The request by the Respondent for a postponement of the proceedings puts this Tribunal in the
invidious position of having to decide between, on the one hand, upholding the validity of the
principles of competence-competence and separability and, on the other hand, accepting the
consequences arising from an injunction against proceedings in an arbitration which the Parties
have previously accepted in a formal and written arbitration agreement. The Tribunal is not only
convinced that it has acted correctly in finding in favour of its jurisdiction in the arbitration but
it also believes, as the Claimant has argued, that it has an obligation to give effect to the

commitment of the Parties to arbitration.

The Tribunal wishes to stress that it is incumbent upon the courts of Ghana, as organs of a State
Party to the New York Convention, to pay full regard to the international obligations that the
Republic of Ghana has undertaken by becoming a Party to the Convention. This is particularly
so under the various provisions of the New York Convention that have been examined above,
all of which point in the direction of the obligation to give effect to the arbitration agreement
and ultimately to the recognition of the award made. It is beyond controversy that a party to a
treaty, such as the New York Convention, is bound to perform it in good faith. As the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties prescribes, a party may not invoke the provisions of its
internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. The object and purpose of the
New York Convention is to ensure that agreements to arbitrate and the resultant awards are
recognized and enforced. It is difficult to reconcile the New York Convention with the issuance
of an anti-arbitration injunction that purports to block pursuance of an international arbitral
remedy to which the State concerned is committed.

In the light of these considerations the Tribunal does not consider that its jurisdiction is affected

by the Ghana High Court Order and Ruling. Accordingly, it does not consider that

postponement of proceedings is warranted in the circumstances of this case. However, as has

been noted above, the Tribunal is willing to consider and take fully into account the views of
the Ghanaian courts on the issues raised with regard to the applicability of Article 181(5) of the
Ghanaian Constitution, to the extent that such views become available in the course of the
proceedings of the Tribunal. For this purpose the Tribunal is willing to approve of an ample
procedural calendar. As has been noted, the Respondent is confident that the decisions of the

Ghanaian courts will not take more than nine months. To the extent that new or additional

 

considerations relevant to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction become available, the Parties are permitted
and encouraged to put such considerations before the Tribunal at any time before the
proceedings on the merits are closed. This is, of course, without prejudice to any other

arguments that the Parties may wish to submit concerning the merits of the dispute.

193. In this spirit of mutual respect, even in the face of divergent views, the Tribunal would like to
address three other issues. The first concerns the Respondent’s arguments to the effect that the
Claimant may be held in contempt of court if it proceeds with the arbitration, contrary to the
injunction issued by the Ghana High Court. The Tribunal will consider any such steps as highly
disruptive of the right to arbitration as embodied in the PPA and the arbitration agreement and
provided for in the legislation of the Republic of Ghana, The Tribunal, therefore, urges the

Respondent not to pursue this line of action.

194. The second question concerns the conservatory attachments for which the Claimant has
obtained leave from the Dutch courts but that could not be implemented. The Tribunal notes the
Claimant’s undertakings to the Ghana High Court of 15 July 2010 to the effect that it will not
seek any further conservatory attachments of any of Ghana’s assets in any jurisdiction pending
the final determination of the arbitration. As this undertaking has been also argued in this
arbitration, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant is under an obligation not to pursue any such
current or further attachments of Ghanaian assets in any jurisdiction pending the final

determination of this arbitration.

195.

a

Lastly the Tribunal must react to the Claimant’s request for a confidentiality order to the Parties
to keep confidential all awards and orders in this arbitration, as well as other materials and
documents related thereto, unless agreed in writing to the contrary, save when disclosure is
ordered in certain domestic court proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider that there is
justification for such an order at this stage. However, it is willing to reconsider the matter if in
the course of these proceedings new considerations are brought to its attention, and the issue is

duly argued by the Parties.
