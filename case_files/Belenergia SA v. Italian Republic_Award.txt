L INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) based on the Energy Charter Treaty which entered into
force on 16 April 1998 (“ECT”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966

(“ICSID Convention”).

2. The Claimant is Belenergia S.A., a company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.

(“Belenergia” or “Claimant”).
3. The Respondent is the Italian Republic (“Italy” or “Respondent”).

4, The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

5. This dispute relates to a series of measures implemented by the government of Italy that
amended its legislation and altered the legal regimes applicable to the Claimant’s Special
Purpose Vehicles (“SPVs”)! through which the Claimant had invested in the photovoltaic
(“PV”) sector in Italy.

6. The Claimant alleges that its investment benefited from “Conventions” signed with the Gestore
dei Servizi Energetici (“GSE”), the State-owned energy regulatory agency. Claimant further
alleges that these incentives were the main reason for its investment and that the measures

implemented by the Respondent constitute breaches of the ECT.

IL. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. Registration and Tribunal’s Constitution

. On 7 August 2015, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration, from Belenergia against the

Italian Republic (“Request for Arbitration”) dated 30 July 2015. On 28 August 2015, the

was supplemented on 11 and 13 August 2015.

» On 22 September 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance

with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an
arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Arbitration

Rules”) and Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.

constitution which was confirmed by Claimant’s email dated 22 October 2015. On
3 November 2015, the Respondent agreed to the Claimant’s proposal. The Centre
acknowledged its receipt of the proposal on 5 November 2015. Pursuant to the Parties’
agreement, the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party
and the presiding arbitrator to be appointed by the two-party appointed arbitrators. In this
communication, the Centre also acknowledged its receipt of the Claimant’s appointment of

Professor Bernard Hanotiau, a national of Belgium, as its party-appointed arbitrator.

On 16 November 2015, following the appointment by the Claimant, Professor Hanotiau

accepted his appointment as arbitrator.

. On 23 February 2016, the Claimant requested to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative

Council to appoint the arbitrator not yet appointed by the Respondent in accordance with
Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 4. On 29 February 2016, the

Respondent stated that it was in the process of appointing an arbitrator.

12. On 10 March 2016, the Italian Republic appointed Professor José Carlos Fernandez Rozas, a
national of Spain, as its party-appointed arbitrator. On 16 March 2016, Prof. Fernandez Rozas

accepted his appointment as arbitrator.

proposal on 3 November 2015, the two-party appointed arbitrators, Prof. Hanotiau and Prof.
Fernandez Rozas, jointly elected on 8 May 2016, Mr. Yves Derains, a national of France, as

the presiding arbitrator.

14. On 12 May 2016, Mr. Derains accepted his appointment as the presiding arbitrator. On
13 May 2016, the Centre invited the Parties to submit any observations on this appointment no

later than on 17 May 2016.

uw

Not having received any observations from the Parties, on 18 May 2016, the Secretary-
General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that
all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Natalf Sequeira, ICSID Legal Counsel, was

designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

. On 7 June 2016, on request by the President of the Tribunal, the Centre enquired the Parties
whether they agreed to the appointment of Ms. Aurore Descombes as his assistant in this case.

confirmed that they did not have any observations on Ms. Descombes appointment.
B. The First Session

ge

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a First Session with the

Parties on 7 July 2016 by teleconference.

Tribunal on disputed issues. POI provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules
would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English,
and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. POI also sets out a schedule for the

merits phase of the proceedings (“Procedural Calendar”), attached as Annex A.

C. The European Commission’s Application to Intervene

. On 24 October 2016, the European Commission (“EC”) submitted an Application for Leave

to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (“EC’s Application”) pursuant to Article 37(2) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules.

. On 26 October 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their comments on the EC’s

Application. On 10 and 24 November 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent, respectively,

submitted their observations on the EC’s Application.

On 16 December 2016, the Tribunal issued its Decision to grant the EC’s Application and
informed the Parties that it will fix a date for the submission of the EC’s amicus curiae brief
(“Amicus Brief”). On 3 April 2017, the Tribunal invited the EC to submit its amicus curiae
brief by 31 May 2017 limited to issues of jurisdiction and to the issue whether Article 26 of
the ECT applies to the dispute. On 8 May 2017, the Centre made the jurisdiction submissions

and certain exhibits available to the EC as agreed by the Parties.

On 31 May 2017, the EC filed an Amicus Brief accompanied by the supporting documentation,
EC-1 to EC-41.

D. The Written Phase

On 31 October 2016, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to stay the deadline for its
submission of the Memorial (“Statement of Claim”), which in accordance with the Procedural
Calendar was due on 21 November 2016, this due to the overlapping of deadlines triggered
by the EC’s Application. On 2 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on
the Claimant’s request and requested the Tribunal to also stay all further deadlines and to

establish new deadlines of further submissions.

25. On 3 November 2016, the Parties submitted further observations on the Claimant’s request to

stay the Procedural Calendar.

26. On 6 November 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”), confirming the
schedule for the Parties to submit comments to the EC’s Application and amending some

deadlines in the Procedural Calendar.

27. On 18 November 2016, Lexlitis notified that it was no longer going to represent the Claimant
in this proceeding. On 21 November 2016, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to grant an
extension to file its Statement of Claim to 7 December 2016 due to the change in legal
representation. On 22 November 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal had
suspended the time-limit for the Claimant’s submission of its Statement of Claim and invited

the Respondent to comment on the Claimant’s request for the extension.

28. On 23 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its agreement to the Claimant’s request for
the extension of its submission of its Statement of Claim. On 6 December 2016, the Tribunal

granted the Claimant’s request.

29. On 6 December 2016, the Claimant requested a further extension to file its Statement of Claim

to 14 December 2016. On 7 December 2016, the Tribunal granted this extension.

30. On 14 December 2016, the Claimant filed its Statement of Claim, accompanied by the witness
statement of Mr. Jacques Edouard Levy (“First Witness Statement of Mr. Levy”), the Expert
Opinion of Professor Valerio Onida and Professor Barbara Randazzo (“First Opinion of
Professors Onida and Randazzo”), the Expert Report of Alpha Value (Mr. Juan Camilo
Rodriguez) (“Alpha Value’s First Report”) which contained Appendices 1-7, Factual

. On 13 February 2017, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to grant an extension to file its
Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Statement of Defense”). On
14 February 2017, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its observations on this request
and invited the Parties to agree on a revised Procedural Calendar without modifying the hearing
dates. On 21 February 2017, the Claimant confirmed that it had no objection on the
Respondent’s request of 13 February 2017, and transmitted to the Tribunal an agreed revised

Procedural Calendar.

32. On 21 February 2017, the Parties agreed to a revised Procedural Calendar.

33. On 3 April 2017, by the President of the Tribunal’s request, the Centre enquired if the Parties
agreed to the replacement of Ms. Descombes with Ms. Ana Paula Montans as his assistant in
this case. Ms. Montans provided her curriculm vitae and a declaration of independence. The

Parties confirmed that they did not have any observations to Ms. Montans appointment.

accompanied by the Index of Factual Exhibits and Legal Authorities, the witness statements
of: Mr. Daniele Bacchiocchi (“First Witness Statement of Eng. Bacchiocchi’”), Eng. Luca
Miraglia (“First Witness Statement of Eng. Miraglia’”), the Expert Legal Opinion of Prof.

requesting that the Tribunal decide on the jurisdictional objections before discussing the
merits;? and that (ii) the arbitration be suspended until the decision of the European Court of

Justice (“ECJ”) in Slowakische Republik (Slovak Republic) v. Achmea BV (“Achmea”)?

On 24 July 2017, the Respondent transmitted to the Tribunal the Parties’ agreement to
postpone the deadline for the submissions of the Claimant’s Reply on the Merits and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction to 20 September 2017 (“Claimant’s Reply”), and the Respondent’s
Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction to 15 December 2017 (“Respondent’s

36. Italy did not reiterate its request for bifurcation let alone its request for the suspension of

the proceedings in the Rejoinder.

On 11 January 2018, by the President of the Tribunal’s request, the Centre enquired if the
Parties agreed to the replacement of Ms. Montans with Dr. Ana Gerdau de Borja Mercereau as
his assistant in this case. Dr. Gerdau de Borja Mercereau provided her curriculm vitae and a
declaration of independence. The Parties confirmed that they did not have any observations to
Dr. Gerdau de Borja Mercereau appointment and on 12 January 2018 the Centre sent a letter

to confirm her appointment.

On 8 March 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide its comments on the ECJ’s
decision in Achmea by 19 March 2018, and stated that it was prepared to admit such evidence

into the record of the case.

On 19 March 2018, each Party submitted its comments on the Achmea decision as instructed

by the Tribunal on 8 March 2018.

E. The Oral Procedure

. On 27 February 2018, the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing

telephone conference with the Parties.

On 1 March 2018, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confirm whether they agreed to
derogate from certain cross-examination rules which had been modified from the PO1 to the
agreements expressed by the Parties in the pre-hearing agenda. The Parties agreed to the
modification and cross-examination during the hearing would be limited to the contents of the

witness or expert reports.

On 5 March 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3”), embodying the
Parties’ agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions on procedural matters concerning the

organization and logistical arrangements of the hearing.

On 12 March 2018, as ordered in PO3, the Respondent submitted the annexes to Eng. Luca
Miraglia’s two witness statements of 21 April 2017 and 14 December 2017 which had not been

previously submitted.

On 19 March 2018, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to submit an additional

document into the record of this arbitration.

On 21 March 2018, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide comments on the
Respondent’s request to submit an additional document into the case record, no later than on
22 March 2018. By a communication of 22 March 2018, the Claimant submitted its

observations on the Respondent’s request of 19 March 2018.

On 22 March 2018, the Claimant indicated that it would provide certain improved translations

which would be included in the hearing bundles. The Respondent commented on Claimant’s

During the Hearing, each Party submitted various factual and legal exhibits, and the Tribunal
admitted into the record the following: Factual Exhibits REX-72 to 73 and Legal Exhibits CL-
166RM, CL-174RM through CL-177RM.

F. The Post-Hearing Procedure

On 3 April 2018, the Claimant’s counsel submitted an authorization to act on behalf

Compagnia Solare 1 SRL issued by the judicial administrator of that company.

On 10 April 2018, the Claimant submitted an Updated Expert Report of AlphaValue/Juan
Camilo Rodriguez with Appendices | through 5 (“Alpha Value’s Third Report”).

On 16 April 2018, the Tribunal requested the Parties to inform on the following: (i) agreement
on the final version of the Hearing transcripts; (ii) disagreement on “improved translations”
submitted at the Hearing; and (iii) submission of electronic versions of certain demonstratives

and documents submitted at the Hearing.

On 23 April 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement to extend the deadline to
submit corrections to the Hearing transcript and to accept the “improved translations”

submitted by the Claimant during the Hearing.

. On 7 May 2018, the Claimant submitted the electronic versions of Exhibits C-25RM, C-26-
RM, CL-178RM, an errata to the Althesys’ Report, and the Parties’ joint translation into

English of Exhibit CL-3M with a point of disagreement.

By email of even date, the Claimant submitted the corrected Hearing transcript as agreed by
the Parties, with a point of disagreement in relation to Prof. Onida’s testimony (Claimant’s

expert).

On 11 May 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the court reporter would be inserting

their agreed changes to the Hearing transcript. The Tribunal took note of the Parties’

disagreement on the translation of “proveddimento” in Prof. Onida’s testimony, accepting the
transcript with both translations and noting that it would “resolve the possible inconsistency if

and when it is necessary for its decision.”

On 17 May 2018, the Secretariat informed the Parties that the Hearing transcript, as revised by

the court reporter, was available in the case folder (Box).

On the same day, the Parties requested a further correction to the transcript of Day 4 of the

Hearing.

. On the next day, the Secretariat submitted to the Parties a new revised transcript of Day 4 of

the Hearing, as agreed by the Parties.

. On 24 May 2018, the Claimant made a request to introduce the award rendered in Masdar

Solar et al. v. Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1) as provided in POL, { 17.3, in order to refer
to the same in its Post-Hearing Brief due on 25 May 2018. The Tribunal invited the

Respondent to comment on the Claimant’s request dated 24 May 2018.

On the same day, the Respondent agreed with the Claimant’s request on the condition that the
Respondent was granted an extension of time until 1 June 2018 to submit its Post-Hearing
Brief.

Later on that day, the Claimant indicated that it agreed with the Respondent’s request for a

time extension.

By letter dated 24 May 2018, the Secretariat informed the Parties of the Tribunal’s decision to
grant both Parties a time extension to file their Post-Hearing Briefs by 1 June 2018 and their
Statements of Costs by 8 June 2018, considering that the time limits for these submissions

were simultaneous.

On 25 May 2018, the Claimant introduced the Masdar Solar et al. v. Spain award (Exhibit CL-
179RM), as authorised by the Tribunal.

. The Parties filed simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs on 1 June 2018.

On 8 June 2018, the Claimant filed its Statement of Costs.

70. On the same date, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s reliance in its Post-Hearing Brief
on Decision No. 10795/2017 of Italy’s Corte di Cassazione, arguing that this document was
not on record, although an Italian version of this document had been provided to Prof. Onida

at the Hearing.

71. On 11 June 2018, the Respondent submitted Decision No. 10795/2017 in Italian and the
respective English translation, stating that it would not object to the Claimant’s commenting

on it so long as it also had an opportunity to respond.

N

. By letter of the same date, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties of the Tribunal’s
decision to grant the Claimant a ten-day time limit to comment on the Corte di Cassazione’s
Decision No. 10795/2017, to which Italy could respond within ten-days of receipt of the
Claimant’s comments. The Tribunal also informed that it would ignore any other comments
unrelated to this decision. By the same letter, the Tribunal highlighted that if Italy did not
provide its Statement of Costs (due on 8 June 218) on or before 18 June 2018, the Tribunal

would assume that it had given up its claims on costs.

T.

By letter dated 19 June 2018, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the
Tribunal had taken note of the fact that Italy did not present its Statement of Costs on
18 June 2018, pointing out that “[i]f Italy does not submit a Statement on Costs until 22 June
2018, the Secretariat will distribute to Italy the Claimant's Statement on Costs” and that “Italy

shall not have an opportunity to submit a Statement on Costs after 22 June 2018.”

. On 26 June 2018, the Claimant filed its English translation of Corte di Cassazione’s Decision

No. 10795/2017.

On the next day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Corte di Cassazione’s Decision

No. 10795/2017 would be introduced into the record as Exhibit REX-74.

 

. On 2 July 2018, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimant’s comments on Corte di

Cassazione’s Decision No. 10795/2017.

By letter dated 3 July 2018, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal
“(a) acknowledge[d] receipt of Italy’s Reply to Claimant's Observations on Corte di
Cassazione’s Decision No. 10795/2017 (Exhibit REX-74), and (b) declare[d] the discussion on

the content and on the translation of this Decision closed.”

On 24 July 2018, the Respondent made a request to introduce the Communication from the
Commission to the European Parliament and the Council Protection of intra-EU investment

(COM(2018) 547/2) as provided in POI, ¥ 17.3.

On the next day, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment by 30 July 2018 on the
Respondent’s request to introduce dated 24 July 2018.

On 30 July 2018, the Claimant filed its comments on the Respondent’s request to introduce

dated 24 July 2018.

. By letter dated 1 August 2018, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the

Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request to introduce the Communication from the
Commission to the European Parliament and the Council Protection of intra-EU investment
(COM(2018) 547/2), inviting the Parties to file simultaneous observations on the same by

8 August 2018, and noting that discussions on the matter will be closed thereafter.

On 8 August 2018, the Parties filed simultaneous observations on the Communication from
the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council Protection of intra-EU investment

(COM(2018) 547/2).

On 3 October 2018, the European Commission offered to “up-date its written observations in

the light of judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-284/16 Achmea v Slovak

Republic, and in particular to set out its view on the consequences of that judgment for pending

arbitration cases based on the Energy Charter Treaty.”

By letter dated 8 October 2018, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the European
Commission, with the Parties in copy, that the Tribunal thanked the European Commission for
its offer dated 3 October 2018 but found that additional amicus curiae submissions could not
be accepted at such late stage of the proceedings, noting that “upon Italy’s request the
Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Protection
of intra-EU Investment (COM(2018) 547/2) was introduced into the record as Exhibit REX-75

and that the Parties have filed simultaneous observations on this document on 8 August 2018.”

By letter dated 14 February 2019, the Respondent submitted a request for termination of the
proceedings and, in the alternative, suspension of the proceedings, along with the EU Member

States’ Declarations of 15 and 16 January 2019.

. By letter of the same date, the Secretary of the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit by

22 February 2019 its observations on the Respondent’s request dated 14 February 2019.

On 22 February 2019, the Claimant submitted its observations on the Respondent’s request

dated 14 February 2019.

By email dated 7 June 2019, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that Mr. Andrew Savage was

to be removed from the list of counsel of record for the Claimant.

On 18 June 2019, Italy requested the suspension of the proceeding. On 20 June 2019,
Belenergia filed its observations by invitation of the Tribunal. On 26 June 2019, the Tribunal

decided to dismiss Italy’s request for suspension on the following basis:

First, Italy submitted its Request for Suspension by letter dated 18 June
2019, although the Secretariat had informed the Parties on23 May 2019
that the Tribunal expected to be able to render the Award by the end of
June 2019.15 Hence, Italy’s Request for Suspension comes at a very late
stage of the proceedings.

Second, the Joined Cases [ECJ Joined Cases C-798/18 and C-799/18]
concern referrals to the ECJ by the Administrative Court of Lazio, while
this is an ECT arbitration. Italy did not satisfy its burden of proving that
the Joined Cases involve (i) the same parties (i.e. Belenergia is not a

party to the Lazio dispute), (ii) the same object of the dispute, let alone
(iii) the same cause of action.

Third, the Joined Cases are still pending before the ECJ. Thus, the
purported risks of inconsistent decisions and legal uncertainty16 are
hypothetical.

95. The proceeding was closed on 26 June 2019.

96. Although the procedural language of the arbitration is English,* the Parties did not always
present a full translation of the original documents presented in Italian. Consequently, when
necessary the Tribunal quotes some excerpts of documents in Italian when they are not

translated.

Ill. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

97. The purpose of this Section is to provide a brief account of the factual background to the
dispute. Although the Parties have no major differences in relation to events described, they
often disagree on the legal consequences of these events, as summarised in Sections V and

VI of this Award.

A. Italian Legislative and Regulatory Framework

98. At its inception PV energy technology required a high upfront investment. In 1992, Italy
sought to encourage PV investment with the adoption of Law No. 9/1991 in light of Italy’s
National Energy Plan of 1988.° This Law established the CIP6 incentive scheme, which
enshrined individual power purchase agreements concluded between ENEL S.p.a. and

independent private producers with an eight-year duration.°

Later in 1999, Italy adopted Legislative Decree No. 79/1999’ in light of EU Directive
77/2001/EC? on the promotion of electricity produced from renewal energy resources in the
internal electricity market. Legislative Decree No. 79/1999 established the Green
Certificates’ scheme repealing the CIP6 incentive.’ The subsidy level of Green Certificates
was associated with wind and biomass technology costs rather than PV technology costs,

which meant that it was not attractive to PV investment.'°

In the 2000s, Italy adopted a new policy with PV-specific incentive mechanisms, including
mechanisms associated with the 20-year life of PV plants like the feed-in tariffs under the

Energy Account (“Conto Energia’) regime,'' in addition to the minimum price incentive.
Energy Account Incentives (Feed-In Tariffs

The Energy Account regime was introduced by Legislative Decree No. 387/2003"? in light
of EU Directive 77/2001/EC. Article 7 of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 directed the
Minister for Production Activities and the Minister for the Environment to adopt ministerial
decrees defining the criteria for promotion of electricity production from solar energy.
Article 7(2) set forth that the criteria for promotion measures shall not entail burden on the
State budget, be in accordance with EU laws, and include the conditions for PV incentives.

Article 7(2)(d) of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 required that incentives be “of

tive Decree No. 79/1999 (Exhibit C-1M).

decreasing amount and of di ion such as to fairr ion of the in

and operating costs.” (emphasis added).

102. Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 was implemented with the adoption of ministerial decrees
providing for incentive tariffs (feed-in tariffs) pursuant to its Article 7, which provided as
follows:

Article 7
Specific provisions for solar energy
1. Within six months from the date when this Decree enters into force,
the Minister for Production Activities, in agreement with the Minister
for the Environment and after consultation with the Joint Conference,

shall adopt one or more decrees defining criteria for the promotion of
electrical energy production from solar energy.

2. Without entailing any burdens on the State budget and in accordance
with the Community laws in force, the criteria referred to in paragraph
I, shall:

a) establish the requisites of parties who might benefit from promotion
measures;

b) establish the minimum technical requirements of plants and their
components;

c) establish conditions concerning the cumulation of promotion
measures with other incentives;

d) establish procedures to determine the size of promotion measures.
For electricity produced by photovoltaic conversion of solar energy,
they shall provide for a specific, incentive tariff, of decreasing amount
and of duration such as to guarantee fair remuneration of the
investment and operating costs;

e) establish a target for the rated power to be installed;

Sf) also fix the maximum limit of the cumulative electric power of all the
plants that may benefit from the promotion measures; [...]

103. Ministerial Decree of 28 July 2005'* and Ministerial Decree of 6 February 2006 set up the
“Energy Account I.” Article 6(3) of Ministerial Decree of 28 July 2005 on Energy Account

I set forth the incentive tariff (feed-in tariff) in relation to PV plants with power exceeding

50kW and less than 1000kW, as follows:
Article 6

Criteria to determine the amount aimed at supporting photovoltaic
plants with a rated power higher than 20 kW

[...] 3. In addition to the recognition of conditions referred to in
Subparagraph 1, electricity produced by photovoltaic plants of a rated
power exceeding 50 kW and less than 1000 kW, entered in whole or in
part in the [electricity network], has the right, in accordance with the
provisions of this decree, [to] an incentive tariff whose maximum
measures are as follows:

a) Plants for which the application mentioned in Article 7, Paragraph 1,
was [submitted] in 2005 and 2006: 0,490 euro/kWh for a period of
twenty years;

b) Plants for which the application mentioned in Article 7, Paragraph 1,
was submitted in the years following 2006: the value of the incentive
tariff referred in point a) shall be reduced by 2%, with rounding to the
third decimal place, for each of the years following 2006, without
prejudice to the period of twenty years.

The amount of the incentive tariff actually recognized shall be
determined by the rules set out in Article 7, in the maximum limit of the
cumulated nominal power referred to in Article 12, Paragraph 3.

Article 6(6) set forth the criteria for the revision of feed-in tariffs to be carried out on
1 January yearly, “on the basis of the annual rate of change, referred to in the previous 12

months, of consumer prices for the families of workers and employees reported by Istat.”

Article 11(1) of Ministerial Decree of 28 July 2005 provided that 300MW was the national
target of accumulated PV power to be installed by 2015. Further, Article 12(3) of the same
Ministerial Decree fixed at 4OMW the accumulated nominal power limit of all PV plants that
can obtain the feed-in tariff pursuant to Article 6(3). The overall accumulated nominal power

limit was fixed at 1OOMW under Article 12(1) of the same Ministerial Decree.

In 2007, Ministerial Decree of 19 February 2007 introduced the “Energy Account II”

seeking to make corrections to the Energy Account I regime “introducing a simplified, stable

old

and sustainable system of access to incentives. Article 6 of Ministerial Decree of

19 February 2007 fixed the incentive tariffs (feed-in tariffs), as follows:
Article 6
Incentive tariffs and period of entitlement

I. The electricity produced by photovoltaic systems, realized in
accordance with this decree and entered into service during the period
between the date of issue of the measure referred to in Article 10,
Paragraph 1, and 31 December 2008, has the right to an incentivising
tariff which, in relation to the nominal power and typology of the plant,
referred to in art. 2, paragraph 1, letters b1), b2) and b3), takes the
value set out in the next table (Euro/KWh values produced by the
photovoltaic plant). The tariff identified on the basis of the same table
is recognised for a period of twenty years from the date of entry into
operation of the plant at a constant price throughout the entire period
of twenty years.

109. Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010!° introduced the “Energy Account III” designed to
take effect on 1 January 2011. This Decree was adopted in light of Article 6(3) of Ministerial
Decree of 19 February 2007, which foresaw the adoption of subsequent decrees with
redefined incentive tariffs to be adopted every two years for plants becoming operational

after 2010.

110. Article 8 of Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010 set forth tariff incentives (feed-in tariffs)
for PV plants without innovative features becoming operational after 31 December 2010, as

follows:
Article 8
Incentive tariffs

1. The incentive tariffs under this title shall apply to solar photovoltaic
plants that come into exercise after new construction works, total

Pursuant to Article 8(2) of Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010, PV plants without
innovative features starting operations in 2012 and 2013 were entitled to the same rate with
a 6% reduction per annum and with commercial rounding to the third decimal place. Tables
B and C of the same Decree set out incentive rates for PV plants with innovative features

and PV plants concentrating photovoltaic installations, respectively.

The tariffs set out in Table A above were granted for a 20-year period pursuant to Article 8(4)
of Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010 (Energy Account III). Article 3(1) of the same
Decree fixed at 8,000MW the national target of accumulated PV power to be installed by
2020. In turn, the overall accumulated nominal power limit was fixed at (a) 3,000MW for
PV plants without innovative features; (b) 3,000MW for PV plants with innovative features;
and (c) 200MW for PV plants concentrating photovoltaic installations, pursuant to

Article 12(2), (3) and (4) of the same Ministerial Decree, respectively.

Before the Energy Account III took effect, Italy adopted Law No. 129/2010 of 13 August
2010 (“Salva Alcoa Law’) to tackle delays in network connection faced by PV producers.
The Salva Alcoa Law thus extended the 2010 tariffs under the Energy Account II until
30 June 2011 for plants certifying full installation by 31 December 2010 and start of

operations by 30 June 2011.'7 This means that the Energy Account II coexisted with the

Energy Account III for six months.

114. Later on 3 March 2011 Italy enacted Legislative Decree No. 28/2011'* (“Romani Decree”)
implementing EU Directive 2009/28/EC.'? Article 23 on “General Principles” of the
Romani Decree set forth the principles of efficiency, simplification, stability, harmonization
and reduction of burden on consumers, seeking to “redefine” and “develop” incentives in
light of “market mechanisms and the evolution of technologies of renewable sources and

energetic efficiency,” reading that:
Article 23
General Principles

1. This Title redefines the regulation of the support regimes applicable
to the energy produced by renewable sources and energetic efficiency
through the reorganization and strengthening of current incentive
systems. The new regulation establishes a general framework in order
to promote the energy production from renewable sources and energetic
efficiency adequately to achieve the purposes under Article 3, through
the provision of criteria and instruments that promote the efficacy,
efficiency, simplification, stability in the long term of the incentive
ystems, pursuing at the same time the harmonization with other
instruments that have similar purpose and the reduction of specific
support burdens for consumers.

  

2. Further general principles of the redefinition and the development of
incentive systems are the gradation of the action for the protection of
investments made and the proportionality to the objectives, moreover
the flexibility of the structure of support regimes, in order to take into
account the market mechanisms and the evolution of technologies of
renewable sources and energetic efficiency.”°

115. Among other amendments, the Romani Decree repealed Article 7 on “Specific provisions for
solar energy” of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, “[w]ithout prejudice to the acquired

rights and the effects produced taking into account the provisions of Article 24, Paragraph 5,

Letter o).?! Article 24 of Romani Decree set forth the general criteria for PV incentives, as

follows:
Article 24
Incentive mechanism

1. The production of electric energy from plants powered by renewable
sources entered in exercise after 31 December 2012 is incentivized
through instruments and on the basis of general parameters provided
by Paragraph 2 and specific criteria under Paragraphs 3 and 4. The
protection of not incentivized productions is shall be made with the
instruments under Paragraph 8.

2. The production of electric energy from plants under Paragraph I is
incentivized on the basis of the following general criteria:

a) the incentive has the aim to grant an equal remuneration of
investments and functioning costs;

b) the duration of the right to the incentive is equal to the average
standard life for the specific typologies of plants and starts from the date
in which the plant came into exercise;

c) the incentive remain stable for the whole period of the right and may
take into account the economic value of the energy produced;

d) the incentives are allocated through private contracts between the
GSE and the responsible person of the plant, based on a standard
contract defined by the Authority for the electric energy and gas, within
three months from the date of come into force of the first of the decrees
under paragraph 5;

e) without prejudice to Letter i) of this Paragraph and Letter c) of
Paragraph 5, the incentive is assigned exclusively to the production of
new plants, included plants realized after a total rebuilding, repowered
plants, limited to the additional reproducibility, and from hybrid
central, limited to the portion of the energy produced by renewable
sources;

Sf) the incentive assigned to the electric energy produced by solar
photovoltaic plants is greater for plants with high concentration (400

suns) and take account of the greater relation between the energy
produced and the used surface; [...]

5. With the decrees of Minister of Economic Development in agreement
with the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of Land and
Sea, and, for the competence profiles, with the Minister of Agricultural
and Forestry Politics, heard the Authority for the electric energy and
gas and the Unified Conference, pursuant to Article 8 of Legislative
Decree 28 August 1997, No. 281, are defined the procedures to
implement incentive systems under this Article, in accordance with the
criteria set out in the preceding Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. The decrees
regulate, in particular:

a) the values of the incentives provided by paragraph 3 for plants that
come into exercise starting from I January 2013 and the incentives
auction base in application of paragraph 4, without prejudice to the
different effective dates fixed pursuant to the implementing decrees
provided by the Article 7 of Legislative Decree 29 December 2003,
No. 387 as well as the power values, articulated for source and
technology, of plants subject to tender procedures;

b) the procedures with which the GSE selects the subjects that are
entitled to receive the incentive through tender procedures;

c) the procedure for the transition from the old to the new incentive
mechanism. In particular, are determined the procedures with which
the right to benefit of green certificates for the years subsequent to 2015,
also from plants not powered by renewable sources, is switched over
into the right to access, for the remaining period of right to green
certificates, to an incentive included in the kind provided by paragraph
3, in order to grant the return on investments made;

d) the calculation procedure and application of the incentives for the
productions attributed to renewable sources in hybrid centrals;

e) the procedure with which was modified the mechanism of net
metering for plants, also in exercise, that access to this service, in order
to simplify the use; [...]

116. After the enactment of the Romani Decree, Ministerial Decree of 5 May 201 1” established
the Energy Account IV for PV plants starting operation after 31 May 2011. The Preamble

of Ministerial Decree of 5 May 2011 referred to the progressive reduction of tariffs in light

of the evolution of PV technology costs and that subsidies may no longer be necessary.”*

36

Article 1 of the same Ministerial Decree set forth the indicative national target of 23,000MW

corresponding to cumulated annual incentives costs between € 6 billion to € 7 billion.

117. Like Energy Account III, Energy Account IV provided for differentiated feed-in tariffs
(a) for PV plants without innovative features; (b) for PV plants with innovative features; and
(c) for PV plants concentrating photovoltaic installations, according to Article 12, Article 16,
and Article 18 of Ministerial Decree of 5 May 2011, respectively. Paragraphs (2) of
Article 12, Article 16, and Article 18 read that:
The incentive rate is recognised for a period of twenty years from the
date of entry into operation of the plant and is constant in current
currency throughout the period of incentive.*+
118. Annex 5 of the same Decree contained different tables with tariffs applying to these different
types of PV plants depending on the date that a PV plant started operations. For example,
Tables 1 to4 set forth the feed-in tariffs under Energy Account IV for plants without

innovative features starting in 2011 and subsequent years:

its Preamble to the fact that by March 2012 the cumulated annual cost of PV incentives
reached € 5.6 billion, close to the cost cap set forth in Article 1 of Ministerial Decree of 5
May 2011. Consequently, Article 1(5) of Ministerial Decree of 5 July 2012 capped at € 6.7
billion the cumulated annual cost of PV incentives, as follows:

This Decree shall cease to apply, in any case, after thirty calendar days

from the date of the achievement of cumulative indicative cost equal to

6.7 billion of euro[s] each year. The date of the achievement of the

aforementioned value of 6.7 billion of euro[s] each year shall be

communicate[d], based on the elements provided by the GSE, [by] the

Authority for the Electric Energy and Gas, with the procedures

mentioned in Paragraph 2.
Article 5(1) of Ministerial Decree of 5 July 2012 provided, among other things, for incentive
tariffs for plants with power up to IMW, pursuant to its Annexes 5 to 7. Article 5(4) set
forth that the “incentive tariff is recognized for a period of twenty years starting from the
date of the plant coming into operation and is constant in currency for the whole incentive
period.” Further, Article 20(1) provided that the cost cap did not affect rights of PV plant
owners acquired before the cap is reached:

Starting from the date indicated in Article 1, Paragraph 5, the present

Decree and the dispositions of the previous incentives measures of the

photovoltaic source that contributed to increase the cumulative costs

reached at the mentioned date, shall cease to apply. The rights acquired

up to the mentioned date are saved.”

the incentive tariffs or to have the tariffs adjusted on a voluntary basis.*”

123. In 2014, the Spalma Incentivi Legislative Decree No.91 of 24 June 2014
(“Spalma Incentivi Decree”)*' reduced feed-in tariffs applying to all PV plants with a
nominal power above 200kW, irrespective of GSE Conventions already in force. The Spalma
Incentivi Decree was later confirmed by Conversion Law No. 116/2014_ of
11 August 2014.7 Article 26(3) of Spalma Incentivi Decree as amended by Conversion Law
No. 116/2014 provides as follows:

certificati verdi, tariffe omnicomprensive owvero tariffe premio possono, per i medesimi impianti, in misura
alternativa: a) continuare a godere del regime incentivante spettante per il periodo di diritto residuo. In tal caso, per
un periodo di dieci anni decorrenti dal termine del periodo di diritto al regime incentivante, interventi di qualunque
tipo realizzati sullo stesso sito non hanno diritto di accesso ad ulteriori strumenti incentivanti, incluso ritiro dedicato

3. As from I January 2015, the tariff for the energy produced by systems,
which rated power is above 200 kW, is reformulated, to the operator's
choice, based on one of the following options to be communicated to
GSE by 30 November 2014:

a) the tariff is supplied for a period of 24 years, from the entry into
operation of the systems, and is therefore recalculated according to the
percentage of reduction indicated in the table in Annex 2 to this decree;

b) subject to the twenty years period of supply, the tariff is reformulated
providing a first period of use of an incentive reduced with respect to
the current and a second period of use of an incentive equally increased.
The percentages of remodulating are established by decree of the
Minister of Economic Development, in consultation with the Authority
for electricity, gas and water system, to be issued by 1 October 2014 so
as, in case of acceptance of all those who are entitled to the option, to
allow a saving of at least 600 million of euros per year for the period
2015-2019, compared with the expected supply with the applicable
tariffs;

c) subject to the twenty years period of supply, the tariff is reduced by a
percentage of the incentive recognized at the date of entry into force of
this decree, for the remainder of the incentive period, in according to
the following amounts:

1) 6 percent for systems with rated power above 200 kW and up to the
rated power of 500 kW;

2) 7 percent for systems with rated power above 500 kW and up to the
rated power of 900 kW;

3) 8 percent for systems with rated power above 900 kW.

In the event of no communication by the operator, GSE applies the
option under c ).°

124. Subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Article 26(3) above provided the PV plant owners with
three possible choices following the regime change. The first choice under Article 26(3)(a)
allowed PV plant owners to extend incentives from 20 to 24 years while reducing the feed-
in tariffs proportionally to the PV plant’s lifetime. The second choice under Article 26(3)(b)
kept the 20-year duration of incentives but varied the feed-in tariffs over time. Finally, the

third choice under Article 26(3)(c) reduced in 6% to 8% incentives proportionally to the PV

38 Exhibit C-RFA-II-12 (Hearing Bundle, vol. 2. Tab 15).

41

plant’s nominal power (i.e. capacity). Finally, in the absence of choice by the PV plant
owner, the third choice under Article 26(3)(c) applied. Belenergia’s invested companies
were deemed to have opted for the third choice, which automatically applied in the event of

failure to expressly make a choice.**

125. By the end of 2014, Article 22bis of Law No. 164/2014*> of 11 November 2014 excluded
from the application of Article 26 of Conversion Law No. 116/2014*° certain Italian public

entities and schools (“enti locali o scuole”).
Minimum Price Incentives

126. Running in parallel to the Energy Account regime described above, minimum price
incentives also benefited certain PV plant owners like Belenergia’s SPVs. Article 13(3) of
Legislative Decree No. 387/2003*” of 29 December 2003 provided that the GSE as the
network operator could be requested by the PV plant owner to withdraw and thus purchase
electricity from the PV plant, feeding electricity directly into the grid. The GSE purchase
regime (“retiro dedicato”) was acknowledged by Law No. 239/2004 of 23 August 2004
whose Article 1(41) provided that the AEEG will “determine[s] the modalities for the

withdrawal of electricity [...] referring to economic conditions.”**

127. The retiro dedicato regime established by Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 was
implemented by resolutions adopted by the Autorita per l’energia elettrica e il gas”
(“AEEG”), namely, AEEG Resolution No. 34/2005*° and later by AEEG Resolution
No. 280/2007.*! PV plant owners adhering to this purchase regime could thus sell electricity
directly to the GSE as an alternative to selling electricity on the wholesale market or to selling

electricity through individual power purchase agreements concluded with consumers. The

minimum prices established pursuant to this purchase regime took into account operating
costs and were thus an alternative to market prices defined at hourly zonal prices (“prezzi

zonali orari’”).

128. Once adhering to the GSE purchase regime, PV plant owners concluded with the GSE
Conventions on minimum prices with an annual and renewable term pursuant to Article 3(6)
of AEEG Resolution No. 34/2005 of 23 February 2005. Article 5.1(a) of the same
Resolution set forth the minimum guaranteed prices limited to “the first two (2) million kWh
annually withdrawn” from PV plants with power below 1MW adhering to the GSE purchase

regime, without differentiation by source of renewable energy, as follows:
Article 5

Guaranteed minimum prices for plants powered by renewable sources
of electrical power of up to 1 MW

5.1. For plants powered by renewable sources of electrical power of up
to I MW, with the exception of hybrid plants, the first two (2) million
kWh annually withdrawn from each plant by the network operator in
accordance with Article 13, Paragraphs 3 and 4, of Legislative Decree
no. 387/03, will be offered, in progressive brackets, the following
minimum prices:

a) up to 500,000 kWh per year, EUR 95/MWh; over 500,000 up to
1,000,000 kWh per year, EUR 80/MWh; over 1,000,000 up to 2,000,000
kWh per year, EUR 70/MWh,; [...}°
129. Article 5(4) of AEEG Resolution No. 34/2005 further provided that the minimum prices
under Article 5(1) were subject to annual update in light of consumer prices for the families

of workers and employees determined by the /stituto nazionale di statistica (“Istat’”).

 

® See Exhibit C-2M (Hearing Bundle, vol. 3. Tab 2), p. 14 Prezzi zonali orari — Coincidono con i prezzi che il
otterrebbe se partecipasse di al mercato.” ding to Italy, the prices sought to

cover operating costs and did not prevent PV plant owners from getting higher revenues if market prices were higher:

at the end of each year the GSE paid an adjustment to PV plant owners equal to the difference between the earnings

pursuant to the hourly zone price and the minimum price offered by the GSE (if the market or hourly zone price

surpassed the minimum price). See Respondent’s Power Point Presentation of 26 March 2018, Slides 27-28.

130. Later on 27 December 2006, AEEG Resolution No. 317/2006“* determined that studies be
carried out on the production costs of different sources of renewable energy seeking, among

other things, to update AEEG Resolution No. 34/2005.

131. On 6 November 2007, Article 7 of Annex A to AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007 set forth the
minimum guaranteed prices differentiated by source of renewable energy subject to a 2

million kWh cap withdrawn from a PV plant, as follows:

7.1 The Authority shall establish the minimum guaranteed prices for the
withdrawal of electricity injected annually by hydroelectric plants of
average annual nominal power up to I MW and by plants powered by
other renewable sources of rated active power up to I MW, with the
exception of hybrid power plants. The guaranteed minimum prices are
differentiated by source, they are defined by progressive brackets and
refer to the calendar year.

7.2. The guaranteed minimum prices referred to in Paragraph 7.1, upon
the request of the producer at the time of signing the agreement and as
an alternative to the prices referred to in Article 6, shall be applied by
GSE only for the first two (2) million kWh of electricity injected. The
producer may alter this request no later than 31 December of each year,
valid for the entire calendar year thereafter, by notifying GSE
according to the instructions given by the latter. For the electricity
injected every year and exceeding the first two (2) million kWh, GSE
shall apply the prices referred to in Article 6.

[...] 7.5 Pending the measures referred to in Paragraph 7.1, the
guaranteed minimum prices are set by applying, on an annual basis, to
the values in force in the previous calendar year, the annual rate of
change in consumer prices for families of workers and employees
detected by Istat, rounded to the first decimal place according to
commercial criteria. With reference to the year 2007, the guaranteed
minimum prices assume the following values:

a) for the first 500,000 kWh per year, 96.4 EUR/MWh;

132. AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007 provided that for energy withdrawn in excess of 2 million

kWh, the hourly zonal price applied to prevent market distortions and limit public

expenditure, as follows: 46

133. Article 7.5 above set forth minimum prices for 2007 subject to annual update in light of
consumer prices for the families of workers and employees determined by the Istat. On this

basis, the AEEG published updates on the minimum prices for the years 2008 to 2011,

depending on the kWh amount withdrawn annually, as follows:*”

and 2013, and adopted a basic minimum price of € 76.20/MWh in light of a report by the

2013 with different ranges corresponding to the kWh nominal amount withdrawn annually:©°

€ 38.5/MWh for year 2014 limited to the first 1.5 million kWh annually withdrawn from PV
plants, subject to annual updates in light of consumer prices for the families of workers and

employees determined by the Istat.

Four days later, Article 1(2) of Destinazione Italia Decree? of 23 December 2013, later
confirmed by Conversion Law No. 9/2013 of 21 February 2014, repealed minimum price
incentives altogether. Pursuant to Article 1(2) of Destinazione Italia Decree the minimum

guaranteed price for PV plants with incentives was fixed as equal to the applicable hourly

The Imbalance Costs

138. Electricity transmission and dispatching activities are managed by Terna S.p.A. — Rete
Elettrica Nazionale (“Terna”) pursuant to Article 1(1) of Legislative Decree No. 79/1999 of
16 March 1999 (“Bersani Decree”). — Article 2(10) of Legislative Decree No. 79/99
defines dispatching as “the activity aimed at providing instructions for the use and the
coordinated operation of production facilities, the network of transmission and auxiliary

services.”

139. The Respondent explains that until 2012 imbalance costs for non-programmable renewable
energy plants such as Belenergia’s PV plants were fixed “as equal to the hourly zonal price,

55 An imbalance is the

discrepancy between the programmed and the injected electricity by a power plant, which,
in the case of PV plants, is calculated in aggregate fashion, per market area.*° The unitary

imbalance cost for a PV plant will depend on the aggregate imbalance of an electricity zone.

140. If the unitary imbalance is positive (i.e. the PV plant has programmed injecting 80MWh but
has actually injected 100MWh), two scenarios*’ may follow depending on the aggregate
zonal imbalance. If the aggregate zonal imbalance was negative, the PV plant is entitled to
80MWh multiplied by the hourly zonal price € 70/MWh plus 20MWh multiplied by the
average selling price on the Dispatching Service Market or “Mercato per il Servizio di
Dispacciamento” (“MSD”) € 90/MWh, managed by Terna. If the aggregate zonal imbalance
was positive, the PV plant is entitled to 80MWh multiplied by the hourly zonal price
€ 70/MWh plus 20MWh multiplied by the MSD average purchasing price € 50/MWh, as

follows:

AEEG Resolution No. 281/2012/R/EFR*® of 5 July 2012 adopted provisional measures to
promote better planning by renewable energy plants allocating imbalance costs in excess of
20% of programmed electricity to renewable energy plant owners. After partial annulment
of AEEG Resolution No. 281/2012/R/EFR, Italy explains that the AEEG issued

programmable energy plants, noting the need for review of “the guidelines on imbalances

for non-programmable renewable sources.”

14.

aa

On 28 July 2016, AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016 introduced imbalance costs to be
charged on PV plant owners to compensate for dispatching costs of the electricity grid
allegedly attributable to PV plants’ discrepancies in planning the electricity amount injected
into the grid. Pursuant to the Preamble of AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016, imbalance
charges were justified:

[...] because of the general obligation for each dispatching user to

program the amount of electrical emission and consumption with

diligence, skill, prudence and foresight with regard to the system; as

well as clarified by the administrative courts, it is an obligation which,

although explained by the Authority with Resolution 525/2014/R/eel,

was already inherent in the previous legislation of dispatch in particular

in Paragraphs 14.1 and 14.3 of Resolution 111 (original version), this

provision, pending a thorough and complete reform of the dispatching

service (which hopefully will solve the problem in a more radical

manner), introduces mechanisms to provide: (a) a more effective

incentive to plan with diligence, skill, prudence and security and, at the

same time, (b) to enable the Authority to detect more easily possible

breaches of this obligation (also for the purpose of prescribing and/or

disciplinary measures).
144. The Parties disagree on whether imbalance costs charged to PV plant owners with the
adoption of AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016 is a taxation measure (the Parties’ position is

summarised below in {| 215-226 and 280-282).
B. The Claimant’s Investment

145. The Claimant is a company incorporated in Luxembourg acting as an investor in the PV
energy sector. Belenergia was initially financed by the Belgian company Bel A Venture
SRL, the holding company of the investor and entrepreneur Mr. Vincent Bartin.*! Belenergia
invested in ten Italian SPVs having developed and operating 20 PV plants in Southern Italy
(“PV Project’) between September 2011 and December 2013. Nineteen of these plants had
a capacity of just under IMW.

© Exhibit C-12M (Hearing Bundle, vol. 3, Tab 11).
6! First Witness Statement of Mr. Lévy, { 15.

49

146. For development of the PV Project, Belenergia established a corporate structure in which it
featured as the company holding 100% participating interest in nine of 10 SPVs, as follows:
Acquaviva SRL (100%); Brindisi Solar SRL (100%); Casamassima Solare SRL (100%);
Compagnia Solare I SRL (100%); Compagnia Solare 2 SRL (100%); Compagnia Solare 3
SRL (100%); Puglia Energia SRL (100%); Solaria Real Estate SRL (100%); Societa di
Produzione Energia Solare SRL (100%). Belenergia owns and controls Solar Solution

Puglia SRL with a 59% participating interest since 6 December 2013,% as follows:*

 

Solar Solution Puglia’s Ownership
Belenergia SA | 59%
PE Invest SRL [41%

 

 

 

 

 

 

147. Solar Solution Puglia SRL and Puglia Energia SRL merged by incorporation into Solaria
Real Estate SRL in early 2016. Consequently, the Conventions concluded with the GSE in

relation to the merging companies’ PV plants were transferred to Solaria Real Estate SRL.

148. Later in 2016 Belenergia shifted Solaria Real Estate SRL’s control to its Italian subsidiary
Belenergia Mezz Finance SRL which, in turn, is owned by Belenergia Solaire Luxembourg

SA, a Luxembourg company owned and controlled by the Claimant (Belenergia SA).

Claimant’s Three Waves of Investment and the Energy Account Regime

 

149. The Claimant’s investment in Italy took place in three waves. Belenergia first invested in
the SPVs Casamassima Solare SRL, Compagnia Solare 1 SRL, Compagnia Solare 2 SRL,
Compagnia Solare 3 SRL, and Puglia Energia SRL in September 2011.°” This first wave of
investment took place about four months after Energy Account IV took effect. Because all

plants belonging to these PV companies started operations between June and August 2011,

they were all granted feed-in tariffs under Energy Account IV pursuant to Ministerial Decree

5 May 2011.

150. Belenergia’s second investment wave took place between April and July 2013 with the
acquisition of Societa di Produzione Energia Solare SRL, Solaria Real Estate SRL,
Acquaviva SRL, and Brindisi Solar SRL. This investment wave took place when Energy
Account V was effective. Energy Account V quickly reached its cap on 6 July 2013 and thus
ceased to apply to new plants. Irrespective of the regime applying to new plants at the time
of investment, the PV plants of these invested companies received tariffs under previous
Energy Accounts. Solaria Real Estate SRL’s plants started operations in December 2008,
benefiting from tariffs under Energy Account I (Ministerial Decree of 28 July 2005). In
turn, Acquaviva SRL’s and Brindisi Solar SRL’s plants started operations between August
and October 2009 receiving feed-in tariffs under Energy Account II (Ministerial Decree of
19 February 2007). Societa di Produzione Energia Solare SRL’s three plants started
operations between June 2011 and February 12 receiving feed-in tariffs under Energy

Account IV (Ministerial Decree 5 May 2011).

151. The third and last investment wave took place in December 2013 with Belenergia’s
acquisition of Solar Solution Puglia SRL.” At this time, Energy Account V no longer
applied to new plants. Because Solar Solution Puglia SRL’s both plants started operations

in November 2011 and March 2012, they were entitled to tariffs under Energy Account IV.

152. The Table below illustrates Belenergia’s three investment waves in the 10 invested

companies whose PV plants were entitled to feed-in tariffs:’!

GSE Conventions on Feed-In Tariffs

153. Each invested PV company concluded with the GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs for each

of their PV plants (“GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs”). For example, because the SPV

Acquaviva SRL possessed two plants Acquaviva I and Acquaviva 2, Acquaviva SRL received

two different GSE letters” of admission to the relevant feed-in tariff and concluded two

different GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs under the applicable Energy Account regime.

154. Each GSE Convention on feed-in tariffs contained information on the PV plant receiving the

tariffs, including (a) its nominal power capacity, (b) the Ministerial Decree applying to the

plant, (c) the applicable feed-in tariff, (d) the possibility of assignment of future credits,

(e) the Convention’s duration, (f) the choice of forum, and (g) other final provisions. The

The GSE will proceed to fulfil its own payment obligation of the credits
towards the assignee subject to the following conditions:

a) The assignment of credits concerns all the remaining credits held by
the transferor to the GSE;

b) The credits will be assigned to a single assignee;

c) The assignment of credits contract:

(i.) Shall be entered into after this Convention;

(ii.) Shall drawn up exclusively in accordance with specific provision of
the standard model published on GSE’s web site www.gse.it), the
contents of which may not be modified in any part;

(iii.) Shall be notarized by public agreement or executed as a private
agreement authenticated by notary, pursuant to Article 69 of D.R.
n. 2440/1923, and sent to the GSE by registered letter (Raccomandata
A/R);

(iv.) has got this Convention as annex, as integral and substantial part
of that assignment of credits;

(v) The notification to GSE has to be accompanied by the express and
informed consent of the assignor in respect of personal data by the

GSE to proceed to assess the assignor, according to Article 48 bis of
D.P.R. 19 September 1973, n. 602, when the assignment of credit is
notified;

d) The verification, provided for in point c) (v) shall have a positive
outcome (notably there will not be any failure of the obligation to pay
taxes);

e) The assignment of credits has to be expressly accepted by the GSE
using registered letter (Raccomandata A/R) sent to assignor and
assignee;

The acceptance of the credits assignment does not affect the GSE's right

able to claim against the assignor.

The possible re-assignment of remaining credit to previous assignor has
to be:

(a. 1) in the same form as the assignment of credits was written the first
time, this implies:

(i) drafted by notarised public act or private agreement authenticated
by notary;

A/R) and the new bank account requested for the credits payment;

(d.1) expressly accepted by the GSE through registered letter
(Raccomandata A/R) to the parties;

The re-assignment of remaining credits, will not change the GSE's right
to claim, against the previous assignor, a set-off that GSE would have
been able to claim against the assignee.

The GSE will pay the remaining credits to the original creditor from the
second month subsequent to that of acceptance of the re-assignment of
credits.

Article 8
Effective date and duration

This Convention will be effective from 4 August 2009 and will terminate
on 3 August 2029.

This Convention will terminate by law and will be declared ineffective
between the parties if the Producer falls under any case of termination
pursuant to Article 10 of Lawn. 575/1965 as subsequently amended and
integrated, or if the aforementioned situation provided for by Article 10,
Paragraph 3 of Resolution n.90/07 occurs.

Article 9
Jurisdiction

Any proceedings deriving from or in any case connected to the
interpretation or the execution of this Agreement and connected
documents shall be settled before the Court of Rome.

Article 10
Completion of this Convention

For the completion of this Convention the Producer has to print, from
the web site, the specific Declaration of Acceptance and send it to GSE,
signed with the attached copy of his own valid document.

This Convention will be effective once the GSE accepts the mentioned
Declaration, making available on the website the copy for the Producer,
undersigned by its own legal representative.

Following the entrance into legal force of this convention, any possible
agreement to amend or add the content of the Convention, shall be a
nullity unless agreed in writing.

The parties are aware that every declaration originating from this
Convention are given pursuant to DPR. 445/00.

In accordance with Clause 1341 and 1342 of the Italian Civil Code, the
Parties specifically approve the following Clauses, after having
carefully reviewed them:

Article 2 “Effective date and value of incentive”, 3 “Procedure for the
release of the incentive tariffs”, 4 “Assignment of credits”, 5
“Liability”, 9 “Jurisdiction”, 10 “Completion of this Convention”,
provided by this Convention. [...]

155. Article 4 above expressly provided for the possibility of assignment of future receivables of
the SPV founded on the feed-in tariffs granted under the GSE Convention. In this respect,
Belenergia explains that it assigned most of these receivables to banks to help finance its
investment; the GSE Conventions’ income stream served as the basis for the receivables’

assignment as a collateral for bank loans.””

156. For example, Recital (e) of the Assignment Agreement of receivables generated by the PV
plant Faggiono 1, owned by Casamassima Solare SRL, expressly provided that the banks
(assignees) sought to acquire through this Agreement “all the pro solvendo receivables,
present and future, due to the Assignor from [the] GSE under the Agreement as a collateral

for the loan agreed between [Casamassima Solare SRL] and [the banks].” Among other

of GSE Conventions’ receivables as a collateral, see Exhibit IM. For example, Section 9.1(h) of the Loan
Agreement concluded on 14 December 2010 between Casamassima Solare SRL on the one side, and Banca
Infrastrutture Innovazione e Sviluppo SpA and Banco di Napoli Spa, on the other side, reads that: “Deed of Assignment
for Receivables from Incentives and Permanent Mandate Agreement for Approved Receivables for Energy
Withdrawal: the Beneficiary undertakes to sign the Deed of Assignment for Receivables from Incentives and
Permanent Mandate Agreement for Approved Receivables for Energy Withdrawal, within 15 (fifteen) days,
respectively, from the date of signing the GSE Agreement (Energy Service Provider) and the Agreement for Energy
Withdrawal.”

 

representations and guarantees provided by the banks, Section 4.3 of the Assignment

Agreement stipulated that:

4.3 The Assignees also declare that they are aware that:

(a) The assigned receivables are derived from the recognition in
relation to the Assignor of subsidised rates to produce photovoltaic
energy by the plant described in more detail in the Agreement;

(b) The payment of subsidised rates, in other words the receivables
assigned by virtue of this document, shall be performed by the GSE on
the basis of the current measures defined in resolutions passed by the
authority for electricity and gas.”
157. Finally, the forum selection clause under Article 9 of the GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs
conferred jurisdiction upon Rome courts. The Parties disagree on whether this forum

selection clause affects the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see below J 206-214 and 260-279).

GSE Conventions on Minimum Prices

158. Moreover, each invested SPV with plants of up to IMW adhered to the GSE’s purchase
regime in relation to each of the respective plants with of up to 1MW selling thus electricity
directly to the GSE. Once having adhered to the GSE purchase regime, these PV companies
concluded with the GSE Conventions on minimum prices (“GSE Conventions on

minimum prices”) in relation to each PV plant of up to 1MW, as follows:””

159. As set out in the table above, Belenergia’s PV invested companies concluded GSE
Conventions on minimum prices between April 2009 and May 2012 on the basis of the
“retiro dedicato” regime established by Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, implemented by
AEEG resolutions. For example, the GSE Convention on minimum prices concluded by the
PV company Acquaviva SRL in relation to the plant Acquaviva J contained provisions
(a) identifying the PV plant and its power in kW; (b) determining the applicable AEEG
Resolution; (c) fixing the conditions for delivering electricity and the electricity price;

IV. THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

A. The Claimant’s Request for Relief
163. The Claimant’s request for relief appears in its Statement of Claim, not modified thereafter:

222. In view of the above, the Claimant hereby requests that the Tribunal:

a. Declare that the Respondent has breached its obligations under
Articles 10(1), (2) and (3) ECT as set out in Part V above.

b. Award the Claimant damages in compensation for losses suffered as a
result of these breaches as set out in Part IV above, plus interest thereon
from the due date for payment of such damages until the actual date of
payment.

c. Order the Respondent to pay all costs incurred in connection with these
arbitral proceedings, including the administrative costs of ICSID, the
fees and costs of the arbitrators and all legal and other expenses incurred
by the Claimant, including the fees of its legal counsel, experts and
consultants, plus interest thereon from the date on which such costs are
incurred by the Claimant until the date of payment.

223. For the avoidance of doubt, the Claimant reserves the right to amend
the relief sought in light of the submission of further claims against the
Respond the di ippl ing, or ing of any of its
claims here submitted, or the submission of counterclaims by the
Respondent.**

B. The Respondent’s Request for Relief

164. Italy’s most recent request for relief appears in its Post-Hearing Brief, as follows:
In jurisdiction and admissibility,

A. Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the ECT does not cover intra-EU
disputes.

B. Alternatively, decline jurisdiction over the totality of claims, since:

a) as for feed-in tariffs (and minimum guaranteed prices), the
requirement of unconditional consent under Article 26 ECT is not

*4 Statement of Claim, {| 222-223.

satisfied as the GSE Conventions contain exclusive jurisdiction clauses
in favour of domestic courts;

b) the measures on imbalance charges are exempted under Article 21
ECT, and

c) no amicable solution has been attempted for measures on imbalance
charges, should these not be considered as covered by Article 21 of the
ECT.

C. Ina further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the
Claimant alleged interests as this is barred from seeking relief, since

a) an exclusive forum clause was selected between the Claimant and the
GSE in the GSE Conventions, and

b) the Claimant did not seek amicable solution for the claim on
imbalance charges.

Should the Tribunal retain to have jurisdiction over the case and that
claims be either totally or partially admissible

D. Declare, on the merits, that the Respondent did not violate Article
10(1) ECT, first and second sentence, since it did not fail to grant fair
and equitable treatment to the Claimant’s investment.

E. Declare, on the merits, that the Respondent did not violate Article
10(1) ECT, third sentence, second part, since it always adopted
reasonable and non-discriminatory measures to affect Claimant’s
investment.

F. Declare, on the merits, that Article 10(1) ECT, last sentence (the so-
called “umbrella clause”) does not apply in the case at stake, or,
alternatively, that the Respondent did not violate it neither through
statutory or regulatory measures, nor the GSE Conventions.

G. Declare, on the merits, that Article 10(1) ECT, third sentence, first
part, does not apply to the case at stake or, alternatively, that the
Respondent did not violate it.

H. Declare, on the merits, that Article 10(2) and (3) ECT does not apply
to the case at stake, or alternatively that the Respondent did not violate

it since it never adopted discriminatory measures to comparable
situations unduly benefitting Italian investors.

Consequently,

I. Declare that no compensation is due.

67

In the unfortunate event that the Tribunal were to recognise legitimacy
to one of the Claimant’s grievances,

J. Declare that damages were not adequately proved.

K. Declare that both the method for calculation and the calculation
itself of damages proposed by the Claimant are inappropriate and
erroneous.

In all cases,

L. Reduce proportionally any eventually recognised damages to
conform to the fact that in the Reply the Claimant abandoned its claims
on both guarantee minimum prices and imbalance costs.

M. Order the Claimant to pay all relevant expenses and disbursements
by the Respondent because of these proceedings in accordance with
ICSID Arbitration Rules.**

V. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

165. The following provides an overview of the Parties’ respective claims and defences. This
summary has been prepared to set in context the decisions made by the Tribunal in this
Award, and is not an exhaustive description of the arguments presented during this
arbitration through the written and oral submissions of the Parties. The fact that a particular
submission is not expressly referenced below should not be taken as any indication that it

has not been considered by the Tribunal.

A. The Respondent’s Position

166. Italy states that some of its jurisdictional objections have been interpreted at times as
“admissibility” objections by the Claimant. Should this be the case, the Respondent submits

that such jurisdictional objections also serve as grounds for non-admissibility.*°

(1) The ECT Does Not Apply to Intra-EU Disputes

167. The Respondent claims that the ECT does not apply to intra-EU disputes, the appropriate

forum for Belenergia’s claims being Italian courts that could eventually refer the question of

ECT’s applicability to intra-EU investors to an ECJ’s preliminary ruling. Italy’s EU
jurisdictional objection on this basis is grounded as follows: (a) the ECT’s interpretation
under international law in view of the pre-existing Treaty establishing the European
Community (“EC Treaty”) prevents ECT application to intra-EU disputes; (b) the EU’s
evolution affects ECT application under international law on treaty succession; (c) the EU
legal order already protects foreign investment; and (d) the ECJ’s decision in Slovak

Republic v. Achmea confirms that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

(a) The ECT’s interpretation under international law in view of the pre-
existing EC Treaty prevents ECT application to intra-EU disputes

Ina preliminary note, Italy states that it is undisputed (a) that the EU Member States involved
in this arbitration were Members of the European Community (“EC”) at the time of ECT’s
adoption; and (b) that the EC (now the EU) and the EU Member States are bound by ECT
obligations under international law.*’ Italy adds that it has never agreed or acquiesced to

ECT jurisdiction; neither has any other Member State.**

According to Italy, the Parties disagree on the extent that ECT obligations bind the EU and
its Member States inter se. In Italy’s view, this is a question “of intent.”*? It rejects the

ECT’s interpretation proposed by Belenergia.”

The Respondent submits that the ECT should be interpreted “in good faith, in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object
and purpose” under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties”!
(“VCLT”).” It adds that treaty interpretation may include recourse to supplementary means

of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.”

Italy cites the definitions of “Contracting Party,” “Regional Economic Integration

Organization,” and “Area” under Articles 1(2), 1(3) and 1(10) ECT when arguing that the

ECT’s interpretation should consider the overlapping areas between the EU and its Member
States.°* In its view, the EU’s internal allocation of competences notwithstanding

geographical boundaries bears on external competences and on the ECT’s interpretation.”°

The Respondent also relies on Article 25 ECT, stating that the EU treaties are an “Economic
Integration Agreement” (“EIA”) having the same subject-matter of the ECT, “substantially
liberalizing [...] trade and investment.””® Also, under Article 25 ECT the EU Member States

have adopted a “preferential treatment” that prevails and is recognised by the ECT.%”

Moreover, Italy submits that Article 16 ECT provides for a “conflict rule” meaning that
“nothing in Part III or V of the ECT [can] be construed to derogate from any provision of
the EU Treaties as for investment promotion and protection, or from any right to dispute
resolution [under EU law].”°* The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s proposed reading of
Article 16 ECT,” stating that a “systematic”, “good faith” interpretation! of the ECT’s text

suggests that:

[...] the EU is recognized by the ECT as a unified legal system, based

on an international treaty whose provisions on the same matters as

those covered by the ECT prevail over the ECT itself, and consequently

that Contracting Parties signed the ECT under the mutual

understanding that this would not apply to intra-EU situation.'!
If the Tribunal finds that the ECT’s textual interpretation is not sufficiently clear, Italy argues
that the ECT’s context shows that it does not apply to intra-EU disputes. Italy states that
Decision in Annex 2(5) ECT! on Articles 24(4)(a) and 25, and the EU’s and Member

States’ Declaration on Article 25'°* provide context to this interpretation.

175. In the Respondent’s view, the combined reading of ECT’s Annex 2(5) Decision and of
Article 25 Declaration on EIA treatment to investments of investors of non-EU Contracting
Parties with EIA presence supports its position. Accordingly, this Decision (confirmed by
the Declaration) approves that an investor of a non-EU Party with presence in the EIA “would
have no right to apply Article 26 [ECT] to protect its position, but would be covered by EU

law and refer to [EU dispute resolution] mechanisms.”!™ Italy adds that the language of the

Article 25 Declaration suggests that it relates to “investments.”!°

176. As preparatory work relevant to ECT’s interpretation, Italy refers to the 1991 European
Energy Charter! that sought to “integrate the energy sector of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe countries at the end of the Cold War with that of Europe.” ©" Article 2 ECT refers

to the “objectives and principles” of the Charter in the following terms:

This Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-
term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and
mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the
Charter.

177. Italy adds that the recitals!°* of the European Energy Charter distinguish between the EU’s
internal market on energy within the EU, on one hand, and the ECT’s adoption, on the

other.!® In addition, at the ECT’s conclusion several EU Directives in the energy sector had

establishment pursuant to Part Three, Title III, Chapter 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, be
treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States; companies or firms which only have
their registered office within the Community must, for this purpose, have an effective and continuous link with the
economy of one of the Member States; (b) ‘companies and firms’ means companies or firms constituted under civil or
commercial law, including cooperative societies, and other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for
those which are non-profitmaking. The European Communities and their Member States further recall that:
Community law provides for the possibility to extend the treatment described above to branches and agencies of
companies or firms not established in one of the Member States; and that, the application of Article 25 of the Energy
Charter Treaty will allow only those derogations necessary to safeguard the preferential treatment resulting from the
wider process of economic integration resulting from the Treaties establishing the European Communities.”

rules for the internal electricity market provided in its Article 26'' a specific dispute

settlement provision for “disputes [...] between an investor and a Member State.”!'*

178. Italy differs with Belenergia that ECT-related documents at its adoption indicate that the

ECT was to apply generally and to intra-EU disputes. In its view, the absence of an express

exclusion [disconnection clause] cannot result in an ECT’s wide application.!!°

179. Italy rejects Belenergia’s argument that “wnanimous case law confirms the ECT’s

application to intra-EU disputes.”''® In its view, the Claimant relies on four to five decisions
of dozens of pending arbitrations; these decisions mainly discuss the compatibility between
Article 26 ECT and Articles 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European

Union (“TFEU”), but not all international law arguments made in this arbitration.!!”

today; (c) EU Member States have consistently objected to ECT arbitral jurisdiction, the
European Commission having applied to intervene as amicus curiae. Because the ECT does
not apply ab initio to intra-EU matters, Italy concludes that Article 26 ECT is not a valid

legal basis for this arbitration.''*

(b) The EU’s evolution affects ECT application under international law on
treaty succession
181. Italy further submits that the EU has evolved in a way that prevents the ECT’s application to
intra-EU disputes. While energy is a shared internal competence, the Lisbon Treaty
“strongly modified the balance of external competences of Member States and the Union.”''?
As a result, the “original allocation of competences” justifying participation of the EU and
the Member States at the time of ECT’s adoption has changed with the EU requiring further
uniformity of its legal order.'?° The Respondent states that the ECT as a mixed agreement
is part of the EU legal order applying within the EU subject to the ECJ’s guardianship.'?! It
argues, however, a potential ECT inconsistency with the EU’s non-discrimination

principle.!??

182. As for Article 30 VCLT on successive treaties, Italy argues that the Lisbon Treaty prevails
over the ECT provisions because both instruments cover the same subject-matter. Italy
relies!” on the 2006 ILC Study Group Report on Fragmentation of International Law (“ILC
Report on Fragmentation”) to argue that the Lisbon Treaty and the ECT have the same
subject-matter. The Respondent explains that Article 30 VCLT does not require “exact
coincidence of provisions or even objectives;” it suffices that EU and ECT provisions equally

cover integration efforts and investor protection, being “institutional[ly] linked.” '*4

183. Italy also submits that the so-called “conflict rule” under Article 16 ECT favours the intra-
EU jurisdictional objection, EU law being more favourable to investors than the ECT. It
highlights that Article 16 ECT concerns inter se agreements between some of the parties on
topics in Parts III and V of the ECT on protection standards and dispute settlement.
Accordingly, by ratifying the ECT third States accepted that EU law exclusively applied

between EU Member States in intra-EU situations.'> This interpretation is, according to

Italy, favoured by Article 30(2) VCLT!”® providing that “[w]hen a treaty specifies that it is
subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty,

the provisions of that other treaty prevail.”'7

184. Italy asserts that intra~-EU questions falling under the ECT are subject to EU law under
Articles 30(3) and 30(4)(a) VCLT, while extra-EU questions under the ECT are subject to
the ECT under 30(4)(b) VCLT.'”8 The Respondent adds that the argument that Article 307
EC on Previous Agreements of Member States (now Article 351 TFEU) trumps
Article 16 ECT cannot prevail because Article 307 only applies to treaties prior to 1958

between the original EU Member States (as in this arbitration).'??

185. Finally, Italy argues that the Lisbon Treaty is “a perfectly legitimate inter se agreement
derogating from the general rules of the ECT by reinforcing the treatment of investors and
investments within the EU.”'°° Article 41(1)(a) VCLT permits this inter se agreement
between EU Member States parties to the ECT, which is exempt from any
Article 41(2) VCLT notification.'*!

186. Moreover, Italy relies on the combined reading of the applicable law clause
Article 26(6) ECT providing that an ECT tribunal shall decide “the issues in dispute in
accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law” and
the offer to arbitrate under Article 26(3). According to Italy, EU law applies to the issues in
dispute within the meaning of “applicable rules and principles of international law,” making

inapplicable Italy’s and Luxembourg’s offer to arbitrate under the ECT.'*? Italy adds that

the ECT offer to arbitrate is discriminatory against Italian nationals, thereby breaching EU

law.!3

The Respondent differs with the Claimant that Article 41 VCLT does not favour inter se
obligations applying only between EU Member States parties to the ECT.'*4 Firstly, the ECT
does not prohibit agreement on special rules (which differ from treaty reservations).'*>
Secondly, stronger EU rules as inter se obligations applying between Member States do not
hinder ECT rights of non-EU Member States.!*° Thirdly, an inter se agreement does not

affect non-EU investors’ right to ECT arbitration.!*”

(c) The EU legal order already protects foreign investment

Italy submits that EU law’s specific features confirm that the ECT does not apply to intra-
EU matters under international law. It explains that among the fundamental features of the
EU legal order are the EU law’s primacy over Member States law and the direct effect of EU
provisions.'** Further, the ECJ and national courts of Member States are the guardians of
the EU legal order, cooperating between them through the use of preliminary rulings under
Article 267 TFEU.'® Another fundamental feature is “mutual trust” between EU Member
States in the promotion of EU common values through their national legal systems and

courts.!4°

Italy refers to the EU principle of conferral governing the attribution of internal and external
competences between the Union and the Member States. The Respondent submits that
energy is a shared internal competence and foreign direct investment is an exclusive internal

competence since the Lisbon Treaty.'*' Under EU law, the Member States cannot

(i) conclude international agreements affecting common rules, meaning that investment

promotion and protection and energy fall within EU’s external competence,'*? and that
“Member States cannot invoke international agreements they have concluded between

themselves to justify a failure to comply with Union law.”

190. The Respondent argues that the internal market is an EU cornerstone. According to Italy,
the provisions on freedom of establishment and free movement of capital and payments
prohibit (i) “directly discriminatory measures by the host Member State, inter alia, in relation
to investment,” and (ii) “any other restrictions, even those of non-discriminatory measures”
deterring establishment and investment from other Member States.'** Italy adds that EU
freedom of establishment and free movement of capital provisions and the EU’s Charter of
Fundamental Rights protect EU investors’ “right to property” against expropriation and
“freedom to conduct a business,” subject to public policy, security and health restrictions

under Articles 52 or 65 TFEU.'*5

191. Italy disagrees with Belenergia that EU does not offer equivalent substantive or procedural
protection. In its view, the EU provides (i) for wide investor protection, including protection
of legitimate expectations through the principles of reasonableness and proportionality of

public acts; and (ii) for access to justice to national courts subject to ECJ’s control ensuring

6

predictability and the rule of law.'*° Italy further submits that the Achmea decision

highlighted that investors are not fully protected in investment treaty arbitration because

arbitral tribunal cannot refer matters of EU law to the ECJ.!4”

192. Finally, the Respondent adds that EU law has created a separate legal order'*® from those of
the Member States forbidding them to agree on investment protection rules inter se. Citing
the decision in the MOX Plant (Commission v. Ireland) case, Italy alleges (i) that under
Article 344 TFEU Member States cannot submit an intra-EU dispute to ECT arbitration; and

(ii) that “an international agreement cannot affect the allocation of responsibilities defined

statement on behalf of the Union when signing the 2015 International Energy Charter:'*°

It is declared that, due to the nature of the EU internal legal order, the
text in Title II, Heading 4, of the International Energy Charter on
dispute settlement mechanisms cannot be construed so as to mean that
any such mechanisms would become applicable in relations between the
European Union and its Member States, or between the said Member
States, on the basis of that text.

196. According to Italy, the Achmea decision confirmed that intra-EU investment arbitration is

incompatible with EU law breaching Articles 267 and 344 TFEU and the autonomy principle
of EU law, this arbitration being thus incompatible with EU law.'** The ECJ’s reasoning in
Achmea applies to arbitration under Article 26 ECT, the circumstances of this arbitration
being identical to those of Achmea under Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.'*? Italy
adds that the ECT’s multilateral character does not affect the bilateral character of the
obligation to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT,'® noting that Achmea generally referred to
agreements concluded between the EU Member States and did not distinguish between BITs

and mixed agreements like the ECT, let alone multilateral agreements.'°!

197. Moreover, Italy posits that the ECJ confirmed in Achmea that arbitral tribunals cannot

request preliminary rulings under Article 267 TFEU. It adds that Wathelet AG’s Opinion
was based on the premise that arbitral tribunals could request preliminary rulings to the ECJ,
which was rejected by the Court.'® Thus, this arbitration breaches the ECJ’s monopoly to

give the final word on EU law matters.'©*

198. Italy adds that this Tribunal should adopt the principle of harmonious interpretation to

argues that any conflicts between the ECT and EU law should be ruled in favour of EU
law.'® In any event, Italy submits that the principle of harmonious interpretation favours an
interpretation of the ECT as not applying between EU Member States. The Respondent
highlights that EU law already provides for investment protection, the ECT Contracting

Parties sharing the understanding that the ECT would not apply to intra-EU situations.!

199. According to Italy, whether EU law can apply to the dispute is a decisive point of the Achmea
decision: it is undisputed in this arbitration that Italy’s PV policies sought to comply with

EU law.'® It then cites the Achmea’s decision, as follows:'

39 It must be ascertained, first, whether the disputes which the arbitral
tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT is called on to resolve are
liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.

40 Even if, as Achmea in particular contends, that tribunal, despite the
very broad wording of Article 8(1) of the BIT, is called on to rule only
on possible infringements of the BIT, the fact remains that in order to
do so it must, in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT, take account
in particular of the law in force of the contracting party concerned and
other relevant agreements between the contracting parties.

41 Given the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in
paragraph 33 above, that law must be regarded both as forming part of
the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an
international agreement between the Member States.

42 It follows that on that twofold basis the arbitral tribunal referred to
in Article 8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply
EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental
freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of
capital.‘

200. Italy further submits that the Achmea’s rationale applies to this arbitration irrespective of
whether the arbitral seat is within the EU.'7! It cites the European Commission’s decisions
against Spain and the Czech Republic finding that “awards rendered by arbitral tribunals
under the ECT in cases concerning intra-EU situations constitute State aids to be authorised

by the Commission before being executed.”'”

201

Italy also objects to the Masdar v. Spain tribunal’s reading of the Achmea decision, including
the tribunal’s reference to the Wathelet AG’s Opinion, noting that the ECJ disagreed with

his Opinion.'” The Respondent submits that Belenergia’s reliance on an alleged distinction

between BITs and the ECT by Wathelet AG is unwarranted, adding that the ECJ has not
discussed the ECT because it simply was not at issue in Achmea.' According to Italy,
Wathelet AG’s remark that no EU institution or Member State has challenged the ECT is

immaterial because the ECT is not limited to intra-EU situations.!”5

202. Italy also argues that the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament
and the Council: Protection of intra-EU Investment!” is relevant for this arbitration, showing
that the Achmea decision also affects ECT jurisdiction. In Italy’s view, the Commission’s
Communication, despite its non-binding character, shows how the European Commission
would decide as a body entrusted with the responsibility to ensure the application of the EU
treaties and to oversee the application of EU law pursuant to Article 17(1) of the Treaty on
European Union (“TEU”).!77 Among other matters, the Respondent adds that the
Commission’s Communication highlights the ECT’s incompatibility with EU law and the

risk of forum shopping, parallel proceedings, and double recovery.'*

203. According to Italy, the Achmea decision confirms that an award on the merits would not
be recognised and enforced in the seat of arbitration!” (France), the host State (Italy), and the
State of the investor’s nationality (Luxembourg).'*” In this respect, Italy refers to Article 42
of the ICC Rules and Article 32.2 of the LCIA Rules on the tribunal’s duty to render an
“enforceable” award.'*! Thus, the Tribunal should refuse to entertain jurisdiction in this
arbitration because of “its inability to discharge the essential mandate to produce an

enforceable award.”'**

204. Moreover, Italy relies on a Declaration dated 15 January 2019'*? by 22 Member States
including Italy to request the termination of the proceedings, citing, among others, an excerpt
that declares the international arbitration provision under the ECT incompatible with the EU

Treaties:

Furthermore, international agreements concluded by the Union,
including the Energy Charter Treaty, are an integral part of the EU
legal order and must therefore be compatible with the Treaties. Arbitral
tribunals have interpreted the Energy Charter Treaty as also containing
an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between Member States.
Interpreted in such a manner, that clause would be incompatible with
the Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied [sic].'**

205. In the alternative, Italy relies on a Declaration dated 16 January 2019'* by Luxembourg,
together with Finland, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden, requesting the suspension of the
proceedings, based on the incompatibility between the ECT and the EU, which “should be
left for the national judge of the CJEU to {] decide[].” '*°

(2) The Exclusive Jurisdiction Clause Under The GSE Conventions Leads To Italy’s
Lack Of Unconditional Consent Under Article 26 ECT

206. The Respondent submits that the GSE Conventions’ exclusive jurisdiction clause triggers
the fork-in-the-road rule under Articles 26(2) and 26(3) ECT'®’ and bars arbitral jurisdiction
over all ECT claims related to GSE Conventions, including matters about incentives through
feed-in-tariffs and minimum prices, their rates and duration.'** Italy adds that Rome courts’

exclusive jurisdiction under the GSE Conventions also bars ECT jurisdiction over umbrella

clause claims on reduction of incentives, and on modification or repeal of minimum prices.'*?
The Respondent submits that the exclusive jurisdiction clause under the GSE Conventions
on feed-in-tariffs and on minimum prices provides that:

[flor any dispute arising out of or in any case connected to the

interpretation and/or execution of the [Convention] and the documents

referred to therein the Parties agree on the exclusive jurisdiction of the

Court of Rome.'°

207. According to the Respondent, Italy’s unconditional consent to arbitrate under

Article 26(3) ECT is subject to subparagraph (b) of Article 26(2), which expressly allows the
parties “to agree on a specific settlement procedure for a dispute or a set of disputes

alternative to arbitration.”'?!

In the Respondent’s view, Article 26(3) excludes Italy’s
unconditional consent to arbitration in case of “any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure.”'*? The combined reading of Articles 26(2)(b) and 26(3) ECT
therefore means that the exclusive jurisdiction of Rome courts in the GSE Conventions bars

Italy’s unconditional consent to arbitrate.'**

208. Italy disagrees with the Claimant’s interpretation of Article 26 ECT. According to Italy, the
contract-based, exclusive jurisdiction clause under the GSE Conventions is sufficient to
trigger the fork-in-the-road rule; thus, commencement of litigation before Rome courts is
unnecessary.'** The conclusion of the GSE Conventions as standard form contracts does not

affect this argument.!°>

209. The Respondent asserts that the broad language of the exclusive jurisdiction clause (“any
dispute arising out of or in any case connected to the interpretation and/or execution of the

[Convention] and the documents referred to therein”) supports Italy’s lack of unconditional

consent to arbitrate.!°° In the Respondent’s view, this clause refers to disputes direct- and
indirectly related to the GSE Conventions.'®” To illustrate, the Respondent refers to litigation
before the Tribunale Amministrative Regionale per il Lazio — Roma against two decrees of
Ministero dello sviluppo economico (“MISE”) implementing the Spalma-Incentivi.'° In
this litigation brought against MISE and GSE, the Respondent submits that energy producers

challenged the MISE decrees before Rome courts on ECT grounds (among other grounds).'?

0. The Respondent alleges that the SGS v. Philippines decision supports this argument because
it affirms that “exclusive jurisdiction [clauses] prevail over dispute settlement clauses in
investment treaties.” Having applied the principle generalia specialibus non derogant,
the SGS v. Philippines tribunal was correct holding that a specific, contract-based, exclusive
jurisdiction clause affects arbitral jurisdiction. This specific clause prevails over a general,
treaty-based jurisdiction clause like Article 26 ECT, unless “the treaty clearly intended to

override contractual provisions.”?°!

On the contrary, the Respondent sustains that the
combined reading of Articles 26(2)(b) and 26(3) ECT, and that previous litigation before
Rome courts by other energy producers support its interpretation.” In addition, the GSE
Conventions’ conclusion was subsequent to the ECT’s signature, confirming Italy’s intention

not to give its unilateral consent to ECT arbitration.”°

Italy flags contradictions in the Claimant’s argument that the fundamental basis of the dispute
is not the interpretation and “execution” of GSE Conventions covered by the exclusive
jurisdiction clause, but sovereign acts implementing the Spalma-Incentivi Decree and the
Law of Conversion, including sovereign acts amending the GSE Conventions.*™ Italy

Belenergia.?°°

212. Alternatively, ifthe Tribunal finds that Italy’s objections to the other ECT claims should not

prevail—gquod non—Italy submits that the umbrella clause claim remains inadmissible. In
support of this argument, the Respondent cites the SGSv. Philippines and the
BIVAC v. Paraguay decisions. According to the Respondent, “[i]t would be contradictory
to invoke a contractual clause providing for a specific obligation of conduct, but not to
invoke, nor take into account, the contractual clause providing for another obligation,
regarding the exclusivity of the forum.”?°' The Respondent highlights that the jurisdiction

clause in BIVAC v. Paraguay had the same content as the GSE Conventions’ clause.”

213. The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant on classifying this objection as one of

admissibility rather than jurisdiction. Italy also disagrees with the BIVAC v. Paraguay
tribunal’s findings on admissibility.2° Even if the Tribunal considers the objection as one
of admissibility—gquod non—the Respondent states that the same conclusions generally

apply to all Article 10(1) ECT claims, including the umbrella claim.?!”

being deemed to having “submitted” its dispute “in accordance with” the GSE Convention’s
forum clauses. As a result, Respondent’s “unconditional consent” to arbitration under
Articles 26(2)(b) and 26(3) is barred, and Claimant’s claims are inadmissible.”!' According
to the Respondent, this argument is irrespective of the umbrella clause under

the ECT as applicable law, when contract claims would be subject to Italian law instead.?!>

(3) Imbalance Costs Are “Taxation Measures” Within the Meaning of
Article 21(7) ECT
215. The Respondent argues that the definition of “Taxation Measures” under Article 21(7) ECT
is “extremely large” and refers to “an open-ended category of measures.” *'® Pursuant to
Article 21(7), a “Taxation Measure” has to be in domestic legislation or in an international
treaty and has to have a “fiscal” character, as defined by domestic law.?!” To illustrate, the
Respondent refers to the double-taxation treaty between Italy and the Netherlands.”!* This
double-taxation treaty does not define future “similar taxes” that may fall within its scope
under its Article 2(4); rather, its Article 3(2) states that undefined terms will have the

meaning ascribed to them under domestic tax law of the relevant State party.?!?

Article 2(4) and Article 3: “[Article 2] 4. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar

(a) a fee is paid in consideration for a public service requested by an individual;

(b) a tax is proportionate to the contributing capacity of an individual, paid for general

public services; and

(c) a contribution is a compulsory levy paid by certain individuals because they
benefit, directly or indirectly from certain public services, irrespective of whether

individuals have requested these services.

217. In the absence of legislative measures indicating the “fiscal” character of a specific measure,

Italy states that the Italian Constitutional Court’s definition of “fiscal” measures applies.
Pursuant to the Italian Constitutional Court, the features of “fiscal” measures are:
(a) mandatory contribution; (b) “absence of exact reciprocity between the parties”; and
(c) link between this contribution and public spending with a relevant economic purpose.””!
The Respondent adds that Article 23°” of the Italian Constitution requires that “fiscal”

3

measures be established by law.223. Fees, taxes and contributions under Italian law fall

therefore within the meaning of “Taxation Measures” under Article 21(7) ECT.?4

218. Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Glossary of Tax Terms (the “OECD Glossary’)

of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) defines tax
as “a compulsory unrequited payment to the government.” The OECD qualifiers
“compulsory” and “unrequited” (unreciprocated) used in the definition precisely correspond,
in the Respondent’s view, to the first and second features of “fiscal” measures pursuant to
the Italian Constitutional Court.?° The terms “payment to the government” could, in turn,

refer to the third feature, that is, contribution toward public spending.

219. The Respondent submits that the OECD Glossary also defines the sources of tax law,??”
domestic sources being “primary legislation, such as acts or laws, and secondary legislation

such as regulations, decisions, circulars, orders, etc.” On the international sources of tax
law, the OECD Glossary refers to the OECD model tax treaty as an interpretative tool. To
illustrate, Respondent cites Article 2(1) of the 2014 OECD Model Tax Treaty,?2* which

applies to income and capital taxes “irrespective of the manner in which they are levied.” °

220. The 2014 OECD Model Treaty does not define the characteristics of income and capital taxes
in its Article 2(2), let alone define “substantially similar” future taxes under Article 2(4).
Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the 2014 OECD Model Treaty, Respondent therefore concludes
that these definitions will have “the meaning that [they] have at that time under the law of
that State [;] any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a

meaning given to the term under other laws of that State.”?°

221. The Respondent submits that the imbalance costs are “Taxation Measures” because they are
levied as a contribution to “the general mechanism of storage of electricity by Terna [the
Italian electricity transmission system operator] (the Italian system operator), based on

advance projections of the quantity each producer would estimate to inject in the national

grid and deviations therefrom.”**!

222. The Respondent highlights the Claimant’s admission in { 126 of the Statement of Claim that
imbalance costs (charges) used to be levied from the final users (“energy consumers’) before
the adoption of AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016.?°2 Adoption of
AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016 caused public service charges (funding Terna’s electricity
storage) to be levied from energy producers like Claimant rather than energy users.

AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016 did not change the “fiscal” character of the imbalance

commentary. Another model is UN model.”

charges; rather, it merely changed the general category of individuals from which these

charges were levied.?**

The Respondent adds that under Article 1(1) of Legislative Decree No. 79/1999** electricity
transmission and dispatching activities are reserved to the State, “granted in concession to
Terna’”, the manager of the national transmission network.?** In turn, Article 2(10) of
Legislative Decree No. 79/99 defines “dispatching” activities as instructing the use and the
coordinated operation of production facilities, the transmission network, and auxiliary
services. As the sole concessionary of these activities, Terna sets forth the rules on
dispatching contracts, including provisions on access conditions and imbalance coverage.
The GSE acts as a commercial contract intermediator vis-a-vis energy producers under
AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007,*° reinforcing the regulatory character of electricity
dispatching activities. In this respect, the Respondent cites decisions by the Italian
Constitutional Court holding that GSE contract payments are “material/factual”
contributions despite their contractual formulation, their contractual formulation being
weakened by the GSE’s intermediation and by the prevalence of non-market-based

considerations.?*”

Respondent asserts that Terna has the duty to grant non-discriminatory access to energy
producers, but this does not prevent it from levying specific charges from them. In this
respect, the Respondent refers to litigation before Italian courts about imbalance costs
imposed on energy producers under AEEG Resolution No. 281/20127* on non-
programmable renewable sources.”*” It submits that producers challenging this Resolution
referred to “imbalance costs” as contributions within the meaning of Article 23 of the Italian

Constitution.” In addition, the Consiglio di Stato has declared that imbalance costs under

AEEG Resolution No. 281/2012 should be levied from a “general category of producers”

not discriminating in the calculation method between producers.”4!

225. The Respondent stresses that Claimant’s arguments rejecting the “fiscal” character of

imbalance charges are groundless. Claimant’s position is inconsistent with treaty
interpretation and with the meaning of “fiscal” measures under domestic and international
law.” The Italian legislature’s failure to expressly designate imbalance costs as “Taxation
Measures” is irrelevant; rather, their “fiscal” features are clear under interpretative principles

of tax law.243

226. In conclusion, the Respondent submits that the imbalance costs claim falls outside the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Imbalance costs are therefore “Taxation Measures” under
Article 21(7) ECT, from a domestic and international law perspective,”* because (i) they are
a mandatory contribution; (ii) they are not reciprocated by a specific service by Terna; and
(iii) they cover public spending with Terna’s dispatching activities and with guaranteeing the
system’s security.”*> Alternatively, the Respondent submits that the imbalance costs dispute

is an intra-EU dispute equally falling outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”*°

(4) The Waiting Period Under Articles 26(1) And 26(2) ECT

227. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s belated introduction of the imbalance costs

claim infringes the waiting period requirement under Article 26 ECT, the Tribunal therefore
lacking jurisdiction to rule on it. The waiting period under Article 26 ECT is a pre-condition
to the Respondent’s consent to arbitrate.’ It further submits that the Amicable Solution
Letter of 8 December 2014 and the Request for Arbitration of 30 July 2015 refer only to
248

claims on feed-in tariffs and on minimum prices, and not to the imbalance costs claim.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant raised—for the first time—the imbalance costs

claim in its Statement of Claim of 14 December 2016, on autonomous grounds. Grounded
on the AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016, the imbalance costs claim is unrelated to the other

claims on incentive measures.“

On the distinction between jurisdictional and admissibility objections, the Respondent
submits that this distinction is “blurring.” If the Tribunal finds that the waiting period
objection has an admissibility character, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to consider its

arguments on jurisdiction regardless of this objection’s character.

B. The Claimant’s Position

(1) Italy’s Intra-EU Dispute Jurisdictional Objection Is Unfounded

. The Claimant rejects Italy’s jurisdictional objection that the present dispute is an intra-EU
dispute falling outside the scope of the ECT, for the following reasons: (a) the ECT was
originally conceived to apply to intra-EU disputes; (b) the ECT applies to intra-EU disputes
irrespective of subsequent EU developments; and (c) the ECJ’s decision in Slovak

Republic v. Achmea does not affect this arbitration.

(a) The ECT was originally conceived to apply to intra-EU disputes

The Claimant asserts that its arguments draw on the interpretative guidance of Articles 31
and 32 VCLT,**! favouring the “ordinary meaning” of treaty provisions, including their
context and the parties’ subsequent practice. The Claimant also states that the Respondent
has failed to produce “a single award in which a tribunal has agreed with an argument that
the operation of the EU treaties bar[s] [ECT] jurisdiction.”*>> Several awards, including
RREEF v. Spain, Blusun v. Spain, and Isolux v.Spain confirm a consistent pattern of

4

decisions rejecting the intra-EU objection.** Although the Claimant accepts that the

Tribunal is not bound by these decisions, there are “cogent reasons” to rely on past decisions,

because, as stated by Professor Christoph Schreuer, “[rJeliance on past decisions is a

The Claimant disagrees with Italy and the European Commission that the ECT could not
have created inter se obligations between the EU Member States and that EU Member States
should apply EU law in their inter se relations and not the ECT. Citing the Blusun v. Italy>°®
award, the Claimant submits that the inter se doctrine, although applied between
Commonwealth States, was never recognised as customary international law.?°’ Because the
inter se doctrine is no international customary rule, its efficacy requires an express treaty
provision; thus, Italy’s argument that the relations between EU Member States are not subject
to international law (and to the ECT) fails.* The Claimant refers to arbitral decisions
rejecting the application of the inter se doctrine to intra-EU affairs (Blusun v. Italy,

Charanne v. Spain, Electrabel v. Hungary, RREEF v. Spain and Isolux v. Spain).?°

Belenergia also objects to Italy’s and to the European Commission’s argument that the ECT
did not give rise to inter se obligations between the EU Member States because the Member

States had no competence to enter into ECT obligations, rejecting Italy’s and the European

on Blusun v. Italy, Belenergia submits that Articles 6 and 46 VCLT?® do not support Italy’s
position, adding that no limitation on Member States’ competence was ever communicated

at the time of ECT’s signature.?7

233. The Claimant also disagrees that the application of the inter se doctrine is a question “of

intent.” In the Claimant’s view, there is no “unequivocal disconnection clause,” or “express
provision or clear understanding” that could lead to the application of the inter se doctrine
in the present case.7°* The Claimant adds that the ECT text is “the only and most recent
expression of the common will of the parties.” Pursuant to VCLT treaty interpretation rules,

the EU, they can be trusted to have expressed that in the wording of the treaty.”?® On the
contrary, Belenergia submits that the ECT Parties have included a disconnection clause to
the Svalbard Treaty but not in relation to the EU in Annex 2(1) ECT; the Svalbard

disconnection clause in Annex 2(1) ECT provides that:

In the event of a conflict between the treaty concerning Spitsbergen of
9 February 1920 (the Svalbard Treaty) and the Energy Charter Treaty,
the treaty concerning Spitsbergen shall prevail to the extent of the
conflict?”

234. Claimant also cites examples of express disconnection clauses in relation to the EU provided

in international agreements other than the ECT:?7!

Article 47(1) of the 2005 Convention on the stepping up of cross-border
cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime
and illegal migration (Schengen III Agreement)

235. The Claimant relies on the principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius, stating that the
omission of a EU disconnection clause in the ECT should be interpreted as entirely excluding
it”? The Claimant also cites another excerpt from the Svalbard disconnection clause under

Energy Charter Treaty shall not apply.’ Express exclusion of Article 16 ECT’s?”*
application to treaty conflicts covered by the Svalbard disconnection clause shows that an

EU disconnection clause could not have been implicit.?”>

Moreover, the Claimant rejects Italy’s reliance on ECT’s preparatory work as a
supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT. According to the Claimant,
recourse to a treaty’s preparatory work for interpretation purposes can only take place when
interpretation under Article 31 VCLT “leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure” or “leads
to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”*”° Citing the Blusun v. Italy
decision, the Claimant argues that it is not permissible to rely on preparatory works when the
treaty terms are clear. In any case, the Claimant refers to the Blusun v. Italy tribunal’s finding
that “the travaux préparatoires seem to point against implying a disconnection clause: one
was proposed during the course of the Energy Charter Treaty negotiations, but was

rejected.”?""

Neither can the ECT’s context, purpose or objective establish a disconnection clause, in the
Claimant’s view. In particular, the purported ECT’s context expressed in Annex 2(5) ECT

below does not support Italy’s interpretation:

An Investment of an Investor referred to in Article 1(7)(a)(ii), of a
Contracting Party which is not party to an EIA or a member of a free-
trade area or a customs union, shall be entitled to treatment accorded
under such EIA, free-trade area or customs union, provided that the
Investment:

(a) has its registered office, central administration or principal place of
business in the Area of a party to that EIA or member of that free-trade
area or customs union; or

(b) in case it only has its registered office in that Area, has an effective
and continuous link with the economy of one of the parties to that EIA
or member of that free-trade area or customs union.?”

The Claimant explains that the ECT’s textual interpretation should prevail and that the ECT
Contracting Parties have failed to include an express disconnection clause.” Italy’s
interpretation seeking to establish their “intention” to adopt an implied disconnection clause

falls afoul of the pacta sunt servanda principle under Article 26 VCLT.?*°

Belenergia rejects the European Commission’s comparison with the WTO as unfounded
under Articles 31 to 33 VCLT.”*! Nothing in the ECT terms, their context, object or purpose,
or its preparatory work suggest an implied EU disconnection clause. On the contrary, the

ECT’s Title 1 on Objectives provides no reference to the EU, reading as follows:

Within the framework of State sovereignty and sovereign rights over
energy resources and in a spirit of political and economic cooperation,
they undertake to promote the development of an efficient energy market
throughout Europe, and a better functioning global market, in both
cases based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-
oriented price formation, taking due account of environmental
concerns. They are determined to create a climate favourable to the
operation of enterprises and to the flow of investments and technologies
by implementing market principles in the field of energy.?**

In the Claimant’s view, the purported ECT’s purpose that its adoption was separate from
“the completion of the internal market on energy within the EU” cannot support Italy’s

argument on the disconnection clause.”

Belenergia also disagrees that subsequent ECT practice under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT?**
could affect this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Referring to the 2016 International Law

Commission’s (“ILC”) Report, the Claimant alleges that Italy has failed to show any

(b) The ECT applies to intra-EU disputes irrespective of developments after

242. The Claimant argues that subsequent developments to the ECT’s conclusion do not bar ECT
arbitral jurisdiction. The facts that no intra-EU investment arbitrations under the ECT were
commenced before 2007 and that EU Member States have presented EU-related
jurisdictional objections in ECT proceedings are irrelevant and do not qualify as subsequent
practice under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT.”*° The Claimant adds that the Electrabel v. Hungary
decision does not support Italy’s argument that the ECT covers only extra-EU disputes.

Italy’s argument is misleading because the Electrabel v. Hungary tribunal did not have to

have the same subject-matter; (ii) even if they had the same subject-matter—gquod non—the
Lisbon Treaty does not prevail over the ECT, since there is no incompatibility between these

treaties.” Accordingly, Article 30 VCLT does not apply in the circumstances; this is the

approach adopted in Electrabel v. Hungary and Blusun v. Italy.°°

decisions. It disagrees that an impossibility to request an ECJ’s preliminary ruling (i) under
the applicable rules, or (ii) from courts of an arbitral seat outside the Union may cause EU
Member States to breach Article 344 TFEU. According to the Claimant, Italy cannot rely
on EU law to invalidate the ECT, on Article 46 VCLT grounds.” Article 46 provides that
the parties (EU Member States and the EC) to a treaty (the ECT) cannot—as a rule—rely on

their internal law (EU law included) vitiating their treaty-making competence.

245. The Claimant rejects Italy’s accusation that the ECT discriminates against EU citizens. In

its view, the ECT “extends to all Member States and is necessarily neutral in this regard.”???
Belenergia adds that bilateral investment agreements are not discriminatory either, because

it can hardly be argued that they adversely affect the functioning of the internal market.?**

246. Moreover, the Claimant submits that Article 16 ECT is not a conflict rule barring ECT

application to intra-EU disputes.””> On the contrary, the Claimant argues that the conflict
rule under Article 16 ECT allows treaties to coexist.2° The Claimant adds that Article 16
does not apply to conflicts between treaties whose subject-matter is different, citing
Electrabel v. Hungary.?°" Even if the ECT and the EU treaties covered the same subject-
matter, EU law cannot prevail under the conflict rule because it is not more favourable to
investors than the ECT.°* According to the Claimant, ECT protection is broader than EU
law especially in the post-establishment phase, including the fair and equitable treatment
standard (“FET”) and investor-State arbitration. The Claimant favours a harmonious

interpretation of the ECT with EU law.”

247. In any event, Belenergia posits that the ECT is the “constitution” of the Tribunal; thus, the

ECT should prevail in case of any contradiction with EU law. In Belenergia’s view,

Belenergia also objects to Italy’s and to the European Commission’s argument on the ECT’s
derogation by the Lisbon Treaty under Article 41 VCLT.*°! The Claimant points out that
derogation by certain ECT Contracting Parties is barred pursuant to Article 46 ECT,

providing that “[n]o reservations may be made to this Treaty.”*°

The Claimant also points
out that derogation would be “incompatible with the effective execution of the object and

Parties to the Lisbon Treaty have failed to notify the other ECT Contracting Parties under

instrument.”°7 Moreover, the Claimant raises three reasons why the Achmea decision has

254,

First, differently from Achmea (founded on the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT), this arbitration
is founded on the ECT providing for a different applicable law clause. While the
Netherlands-Slovakia BIT provided for the application, among others, of “of the law in force
of the Contracting Party concerned” and “other relevant agreements between the
Contracting Parties”, Article 26(6) ECT provides for the application of “this Treaty and

applicable rules and principles of international law.”?°°

Relying on Eiser v. Spain,
Belenergia argues that EU law does not fall within the meaning of Article 26(6), not being

applicable to these proceedings.*”

Belenergia further disagrees with Italy that EU law is part of international law and thus
applies pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT. Belenergia cites the Rainbow Warrior case, noting
that the expression “applicable rules and principles of international law” refers to customary
international law, which does not include EU law even if it arises under international
treaty.>!° The Claimant also submits that the statements in relation to the application of EU
law by the Blusun and Masdar tribunals were made without an analysis of

Article 26(6) ECT3!!

Moreover, Belenergia argues that Italy’s argument based on Article 31(3)(c) VCLT is
unfounded because “[a]ny relevant rules of international law” within the meaning of this
provision refers to general international law as customary international law.*!? Belenergia
further sustains that Article 31(3)(c) VCLT cannot be used to substitute let alone negate

treaty rights.7!

Second, Belenergia argues that, differently from Achmea, the EU is a Contracting Party to
the ECT.*'4 According to the Claimant, “by concluding or acceding to the ECT, the Member

States of the EU and the EU itself established a mechanism for settling disputes between an

the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as they postdate the date when the Tribunal was seized of the

Luxembourg is not a signatory of the Declaration dated 15 January 2019.**° Belenergia
relies on Luxembourg’s declaration dated 16 January 2019,! providing that “it would be
inappropriate, in the absence of a specific judgment on the matter, to express views as

regards the compatibility with Union law of the intra EU application of the Energy Charter

Treaty.”>*

259. Further, Belenergia objected to Italy’s alternative request for suspension of the proceedings,
arguing that Luxembourg’s Declaration dated 16 January 2019 does not state that its
signatories intended the suspension of ECT arbitral proceedings.**? Even if it were the case

(2) The GSE Conventions’ Clause Conferring Exclusive Jurisdiction on Rome
Courts Does Not Trigger The ECT’s Fork-In-The-Road Clause
The Claimant denies Italy’s objection on lack of unconditional consent to arbitrate under
Article 26 ECT, as follows: (a) Belenergia has not previously “submitted” the investment
dispute to the Rome courts under the GSE Conventions triggering the fork-in-the-road clause
under Article 26(3)(b) ECT, as interpreted pursuant to Article 31 VCLT;**° (b) Belenergia
has not previously “submitted” the investment dispute to Rome courts under
Article 26(3)(b) ECT as interpreted and applied by arbitral tribunals; (c) Italy has failed to
show that Rome courts’ jurisdiction cover the same dispute, the same cause of action, and
the same parties of this arbitration; and (d) Italy’s objection is one of admissibility, not

capable of barring the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

(a) Belenergia has not previously “submitted” the investment dispute to
Rome courts under the GSE Conventions triggering the fork-in-the-road
clause under Article 26(3)(b) ECT, as interpreted pursuant to Article 31
VCLT

Belenergia disagrees with the Respondent that the exclusive jurisdiction clause under the
GSE Conventions automatically triggers the fork-in-the-road in Article 26(3)(b) ECT?” In
the Claimant’s view, the fork-in-the-road clause is only triggered with the actual filing of the
dispute before Rome courts, “a forum expressly stipulated” under Article 26(2) ECT.*** It
adds that an existing exclusive jurisdiction clause “does not mean that the investor has

Article 26(3) ECT.*° In the Claimant’s view, an exclusive jurisdiction clause could be a
“previously agreed dispute settlement procedure” under Article 26(2)(b), which does not

equal to “filing” an investment dispute.*!

262. According to the Claimant, neither the Claimant nor its SPVs have commenced any
proceedings, let alone claimed any relief before Rome courts or any other forum.**? It adds
that they merely agreed on Rome courts’ jurisdiction over contract claims under the GSE
Conventions.*4?_ The Claimant therefore asserts that all dispute settlement methods under

Article 26 were available to it at the time that it filed its Request for Arbitration.*+

263. The Claimant argues that Article 26 ECT should be interpreted “in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the
light of its object and purpose” pursuant to Article 31(1) VCLT; it adds that its “context”
“shall comprise [...] the text, including its preamble and annexes” for interpretation purposes
under Article 31(2) VCLT.*#> The Claimant points out that the Tribunal should only have
recourse to supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT (ECT’s

preparatory work) if Article 26 ECT is not sufficiently clear, which is not the case.*4

264. The Claimant submits that the textual interpretation of Article 26 ECT indicates that:

(a) the expression “disputes” concern existing disputes and not future disputes,
the 3-month waiting period under Article 26(2) supporting this

interpretation;

(b) the term “choose” in Article 26(2) implies that the Claimant can choose
between different options, including the option of “[a] previously agreed
dispute settlement procedure” under Article 26(2)(b), but not excluding

other options;

(c) the terms “submit” and “submitted” in Articles 26(2), 26(3)(b) and 26(4)
“refer to the decision to file suit rather than to an agreement that exists

before the choices under Article 26(2) even arise.” **”

265. Moreover, the Claimant asserts that an interpretation of Article 26 ECT in its context and in
light of its purpose suggests that (a) proceedings have to be filed to trigger the fork-in-the-
road clause; and (b) a party can file proceedings and subsequently withdraw from them,
without triggering the fork-in-the-road clause, provided that no final dispute resolution took
place.*4*

359 Ttaly’s Statement of 17 December 1997 of Annex ID ECT (Exhibit CL-151RM): “In accordance with Article
26(3)(b)(ii), Italy declares that it does not allow for a dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party to be
submitted for international arbitration or conciliation, provided that an Investor has: a) already submitted the dispute
Italian courts or administrative tribunals; or b) followed an applicable, previously agreed procedure for the settlement
of disputes. In this respect a distinction must be made between two options: 1) if a resolution of the dispute has not
yet been made by internal judicial or conciliation bodies, the Investor may revoke his judicial action or arbitral
procedure by procedural or lateral renouncement and apply to other forms of dispute settlement; 2) if a resolution or
any formal or legal document of execution has already been made to settle the dispute, conciliation or international
arbitration is no longer possible. The above statements are based either on the principle of ‘ne bis in idem’ (to avoid
two judgments being awarded for the settlement of the same dispute: one by the arbitration and the other by the court

266. Even if Belenergia had actually filed a suit before Rome courts—quod non—it would
nonetheless have access to ICSID arbitration provided that it withdrew its claims pursuant to
Italy’s Statement of 17 December 1997. The Claimant therefore concludes that the exclusive
jurisdiction clause in favour of Rome courts under the GSE Conventions cannot bar ICSID

jurisdiction.**!

(b) Belenergia has not previously “submitted” the investment dispute under

Article 26(3)(b) ECT as interpreted and applied by arbitral tribunals
267. The Claimant submits that arbitral decisions confirm that the fork-in-the-road clause is
triggered when an investor chooses to file proceedings before host State courts or under some
other dispute settlement mechanism.**? In this sense, it cites the decisions in
Toto v. Lebanon, holding that a claim is barred when it was “already brought before a
different judicial forum”, and in Maffezini v. Spain, finding that this is “final and

irreversible.”>

Drawing a parallel with the present case, Belenergia submits that the Lanco v. Argentina**

Claimant argues that the “triple identity test” under fork-in-the road clauses is not fulfilled.
The Claimant refers to various arbitral decisions in support of the “triple identity test”
requiring (i) the same dispute, (ii) the same cause of action, and (iii) the same parties, as

conditions for triggering the fork-in-the-road clause.**”

Referring to Vivendi I, *** the Claimant adds that its investment claims do not allege a cause
of action under the GSE Conventions, but under the ECT. Because the present dispute does
not satisfy the “triple identity test”, the fork-in-the-road clause of Article 26(3) ECT could

not have been triggered.*°°

(d) Italy’s objection is one of admissibility; thus, it does not bar the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction
Belenergia argues that the Respondent has made a “taxonomical error” when referring to the
fork-in-the-road objection as one of jurisdiction rather than admissibility.°° The GSE
Conventions’ jurisdiction clause was contained in standard form contracts. As such, these
contracts were not freely negotiated, a purported jurisdictional choice triggering the fork-in-
the-road rule being therefore invalid.*°! The objection being one of admissibility of claims,
this Tribunal enjoys discretion and procedural flexibility to proceed to the merits despite

Respondent’s objection.*

(3) The GSE Conventions’ Exclusive Jurisdiction Clause Does Not Bar The
Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Or Render Any Claims Inadmissible
The Claimant objects to Italy’s jurisdictional and admissibility objection under
Articles 26(2)(b) and 26(3) ECT favouring Rome courts’ exclusive jurisdiction under the
GSE Conventions*® in the light of SGS v. Philippines, as follows: (a) the GSE Conventions’

(c) the GSE Conventions’ exclusive jurisdiction clause has no effects on the other Claimant’s

claims.

(a) The GSE Conventions’ exclusive jurisdiction clause has no effects on
the Claimant’s umbrella clause claim under Article 10(1) ECT
273. First, the Claimant submits that the present dispute is distinguishable from the
SGS v. Philippines dispute* In SGS v. Philippines the claimant SGS had concluded a
customs inspection contract with the Philippines containing a broadly worded exclusive
jurisdiction clause. After the Philippines’ refusal to extend the contract’s duration and to pay
several invoices, SGS brought FET, expropriation and umbrella clause claims before an
ICSID tribunal. The tribunal held that the entirety of SGS claims arose from the contract

providing for exclusive jurisdiction of Philippine courts, and suspended the proceedings.

274. Conversely, Belenergia states that the present dispute is not limited to contract claims: it
“aris[es] from legislative and regulatory measures with contractual elements, particularly
insofar as the FiT and RDI Conventions [the GSE Conventions] inculcated a legitimate
expectation of stability on the part of the Claimant.”* The Claimant adds that the
jurisdiction clause of the GSE Conventions is not broadly worded as the one in
SGS v. Philippines because it covers only disputes “connected to the interpretation and/or
execution of the [Conventions] and the documents referred to therein.”* The Claimant
explains that the dispute does not fall within the scope of the jurisdiction clause of the GSE

Conventions because:

[...] i concerns (a) sovereign acts of the Italian state through the
implementation of the Spalma Incentivi Decree and Law of Conversion,
neither of which are mentioned in [the GSE Conventions]; and (b) the
unilateral amendment of [the GSE Conventions] through these same

366 The jurisdiction clauses under the GSE Conventions provide in the original the following. Sample ju
clause from GSE Conventions on feed-in-tariffs (Exhibit C-RFA- “Per qualsiasi controversia derivante o

all’interpretazione e/o all'esecuzione della presente Convenzione e degli atti dalla stessa richiamati, che non possa
essere risolta in via bonaria, le Parti convengono la competenza esclusiva del Foro di Roma.”

sovereign instruments, an act distinct from interpretation and
execution>°
To interpret the jurisdiction clause of the GSE Convention as barring arbitral jurisdiction
would be, in the Claimant’s view, the same as giving Italy carte blanche to change the GSE
Conventions as it pleases, including “reducing the FiT and RID [minimum prices] to

zero.7368

Second, the Claimant argues that the SGS v. Philippines’s classification of umbrella clause
claims as contract claims is legally wrong. The Claimant refers to SGS v. Paraguay, *
among other decisions, explaining that an umbrella clause claim is a treaty claim; thus, treaty

jurisdiction cannot be displaced by a contract’s jurisdiction clause.*”°

(b) A stay of the umbrella clause claim would be inappropriate

According to Belenergia, a stay of the umbrella clause claim would be inappropriate. The
Claimant refers to the SGS v. Paraguay’s findings refusing to suspend the arbitration because
umbrella claims were not mere contract claims covered by an exclusive jurisdiction clause.*”!
The Claimant disapproves the SGS v. Philippines’s decision suspending the umbrella clause
claim because (i) giving prevalence to an exclusive jurisdiction clause risks making the
umbrella clause useless; (ii) staying the umbrella clause claim creates uncertainty; and
(iii) an umbrella clause claim is a claim for treaty breach and not contract breach.”
Belenergia also submits that the Tribunal should not suspend the arbitration because
Claimant’s claims extend beyond mere contract breaches, differently from the

SGS v. Philippines dispute.*”

278. The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent that the exclusive jurisdiction clause under the

279.

280.

GSE Conventions could bar any claims based on the re-modulation of tariff incentives and
on the modification/cancellation of the minimum prices.*’* The Claimant argues that the
Respondent overlooks the distinction between treaty and contract claims. Referring to
arbitral decisions and to a scholarly writing, the Claimant states that:

The fundamental basis of [its] claim (save under the umbrella clause) is

not the [GSE Conventions], but the Spalma Incentivi Decree and the

Law of Conversion that — among other things — unilaterally modified

these agreements through the sovereign power of the Italian state.

Thus, to paraphrase the tribunal in BIVAC v. Paraguay, the non-

umbrella clause claims of the Claimant here turn on the interpretation

and application of the ECT and the acts of the Respondent (as puissance

publique), not on the interpretation of the [GSE Conventions] as such —

although these instruments will necessarily be part of the overall legal

and factual matrix, particularly insofar as violation of the legitimate

expectations are concerned for the purposes of the FET analysis.>”°
The Claimant concludes that even if SGS v. Philippines applied to this arbitration—quod
non—it could only affect the umbrella claim but not the other claims.*”° The fork-in-the-
road clause under Article 26(3) has not been triggered because neither the Claimant nor its
subsidiaries commenced proceedings before Rome courts. No “final and irreversible”
choice of forum being made by Claimant or its subsidiaries, the Claimant’s claims are

admissible under Article 26 ECT.”

(4) Imbalance Costs Are Not “Taxation Measures” Within the Meaning of
Article 21(7) ECT

Objecting to the Respondent’s position, the Claimant argues that imbalance costs do not

possess a “fiscal” character; thus, the imbalance cost claims do not fall within the meaning

of the “Taxation Measures” exception to ECT application under its Article 21.577 The
Claimant submits that the ordinary meaning of the treaty terms defining “Taxation Measure”

under Article 21(7)°”? confirms this.*°°

281. According to Belenergia, the references in Article 21(7) to “taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party” and to “taxes of any convention for avoidance of double taxation or of
any other international agreement” imply that only “specific provisions in Italy’s tax
legislation or in its treaties” can trigger the ECT exception on “Taxation Measures.”**!

Imposition of additional costs from electricity supply variations caused by weather

382

changes*** on PV producers rather than on energy consumers cannot be, in the Claimant’s

83

view, equated to “Taxation Measures” under the ECT for a simple reason.*** The reason

being that these additional imbalance costs do not refer to “specific provisions in Italy’s tax

legislation or in its tax treaties” within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a)(i) and (ii) ECT.***

282. The Claimant further argues that the preparatory work on the ECT corroborates its view.
The introduction of the expression “includes” in Article 21(7)(a) ECT by French, Canadian
and Norwegian negotiators suggests that the expression “includes” has the same sense as the
expression “means”. As a result, the definition of “Taxation Measures” in items (i) and
(ii) of this provision is “exhaustive” and should be interpreted restrictively.*** The Claimant
therefore disagrees with the Respondent that “Taxation Measures” are broadly defined. In
support of a restrictive interpretation of “Taxation Measures” the Claimant refers to scholarly

writings by Professor Emmanuel Gaillard and Mr. Mark McNeil, and to the Yukos v. Russia

58 Energy Charter Treaty (Exhibit CL-2M), Article 21(1): “Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in in

Measure’ includes: (i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political
subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and (ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the
avoidance of double taxation or of any other ii or by which the Contracting Party
is bound.” (emphases added)

and the EnCana v. Ecuador awards.**

In particular, the Claimant submits that the
Respondent has failed to show that imbalance costs are “sufficiently clearly connected’ to
the existing framework of Italian taxation law to be considered a taxation measure within

the meaning of Article 21(7).”*8’ The Claimant adds that imbalance costs’ “arbitrary nature

is apparent from the context of their imposition.”?**

(5) The Waiting Period Under Articles 26(1) And 26(2) ECT

Belenergia argues that it has complied with the 3-month waiting period under Articles 26(1)
and 26(2) ECT?*° through its Letter of 8 December 2014*” (““Amicable Solution Letter”)

to the Respondent.*?!

According to Belenergia, the waiting period under Article 26 ECT
does not bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Claimant’s imbalance costs claim for two

reasons.

First, the waiting period under Article 26 ECT, a mere procedural requirement, does not
hinder ECT jurisdiction.*°? The Claimant alleges that the Respondent has made a

“taxonomical” mistake when referring to the waiting period as barring jurisdiction, rather

  

than the admissibility of claims. It refers to the findings in SGS v. Pakistan and in
Abaclat v. Argentina rejecting the “jurisdictional” character of a waiting period objection,
among other decisions.*** It concludes that—at most—the Tribunal could find that the
imbalance costs claim is “temporarily inadmissible,” but not outside its scope of

jurisdiction.*?°

. Second, negotiations between the Parties on the imbalance costs claim would have been
futile because the 3-month waiting period would have elapsed by the Hearing date.*°° The
Claimant refers to the Respondent’s “complete lack of enthusiasm” about other “properly
brought” claims by the Claimant under Article 26 ECT, as purportedly admitted by the

Respondent.*””

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent “has shown a complete lack of
appetite for negotiation,” not having reached out to the Claimant for discussions; the
Respondent has adopted a similar attitude toward other PV investors, which sought to

challenge the PV measures before Italian courts.*”*

For all these reasons, the Claimant
concludes that the Respondent would not have acted differently in relation to the imbalance

costs claim.

The Claimant adds that by the Hearing date the 3-month waiting period would have elapsed.
It then refers to case decisions and to an article by Professor Christoph Schreuer, favouring
the admissibility of claims whose waiting period has elapsed in the interim of the
proceedings.*” In Belenergia’s view, requiring the Claimant to commence separate ICSID
proceedings on the imbalance costs claim would lead to inefficiency and would not serve the

interests of justice.4”

European Commission for its Amicus Brief. The Tribunal highlights, however, that the
European Commission is not a Party to this arbitration. The Tribunal will therefore respond
only to the arguments made by the Parties, taking into consideration the observations of the

European Commission.

D. The Tribunal’s Decision

(1) Does Italy’s EU Jurisdictional Objection Bar the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction?

8. The Tribunal will consider below (a) the applicable law to the dispute; (b) whether the ECT
has created inter se obligations between the EU Member States; (c) whether successive EU
treaties could have affected the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as per Article 30 VCLT; (d) whether
an inter se modification of the ECT as per Article 41 VLCT could have affected the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction; and (e) whether the Tribunal should refrain from exercising its

jurisdiction because of an alleged risk of non-recognition and non-enforcement of the award.

(a) Applicable law

9. At the Hearing,*°' when discussing the effects of the Achmea decision on the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, the Parties disagreed on whether EU law could be relevant to resolving this
question. According to the Claimant, Article 26(6) ECT’s reference to the ECT and to
“applicable rules and principles of international law” should be interpreted to include only
the ECT and customary international law excluding the application of EU law, relying on

2

the Rainbow Warrior case.*°? In turn, Italy sustains that EU law applies as part of

international law.

=

Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that this Tribunal “shall decide in
accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.” In turn, the applicable
law clause under Article 26(6) ECT provides that the Tribunal “shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international

law.” In light of Article 26(6)’s text, the Tribunal disagrees with Belenergia that the

See also Claimant’s Comments to Slovak Republic v. Achmea, {| 16-21; Respondent’s Comments to Slovak

Republic v. Achmea, {ff 4-5.

402

Exhibit CL-178RM, {| 72: “[...] This provision refers to two sources of international law: the conventional source,

represented by certain bilateral agreements concluded between the Parties, and the customary source, constituted by

the

‘applicable rules and principles of international law’. The customary source, in turn, comprises two important

branches of general international law: the Law of Treaties, codified in the 1969 Vienna Convention, and the Law of
State Responsibility, in process of codification by the International Law Commission. The Parties disagree on the
question of which of these two branches should be given primacy or emphasis in the determination of the primary
obligations of France.”

113

291.

292.

293.

294,

expression “applicable rules and principles of international law” should be read to exclude

EU law.

The Rainbow Warrior case differs from this case because its disputing parties disagreed on
whether France’s primary obligations were governed by conventional or customary law.
Hence, the matter before the Rainbow Warrior tribunal was whether conventional or
customary law governed French primary obligations (including the hierarchy between
conventional and customary sources of law) rather than whether other international law rules

were applicable at all.

Several investment treaty tribunals have considered that EU law is part of international law,
including ECT arbitral tribunals in the Electrabel, Blusun and RREEF cases.*°? This
Tribunal cannot therefore accept Belenergia’s narrow reading of the text of
Article 26(6) ECT to exclude the application of EU law when its text expressly refers to

“applicable rules of international law.” This Tribunal concurs with the Electrabel tribunal
that “all EU legal rules are part of a regional system of international law and therefore have
an international legal character.” ** Further, the Tribunal sees a certain contradiction in the
Claimant’s position which assumes that intra-EU Member State investments are international
investments and refuses to accept that EU law is part of international law. Hence, the
Tribunal finds that it can apply EU law as part of international law and “where relevant

should apply European law as such’™°> to the extent that the ECT regime permits it.

Moreover, the Parties agree that the treaty interpretation rules of the VCLT apply to this
dispute. This Tribunal can therefore apply the ECT provisions and international law

including the VCLT when relevant.

(b) Has the ECT created inter se obligations between the EU Member
States?

Italy argues that the ECT has not created obligations binding the EU Member States and the

EU inter se, noting that this interpretation should prevail in light of VCLT interpretation

principles and of the EU’s and its Member States’ “intent.” In turn, Belenergia rejects the
inter se doctrine as not representative of customary international law, submitting that the
ECT was conceived to apply to intra-EU disputes creating obligations between the EU

Member States, in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 VCLT.

The Tribunal has to decide whether the ECT applies to the relations inter se of EU Member
States. Like the Blusun tribunal, which also decided on the same issue in relation to ECT
jurisdiction, this Tribunal will interpret the ECT in good faith and pursuant to the ordinary

meaning of the ECT’s terms in their context and in light of the ECT’s object and purpose.

Historically, the Great Britain relied on the inter se doctrine when affirming the British
Empire’s “diplomatic unity” by rejecting the application inter se of multilateral treaties to
which British Dominions were also parties.*°° As pointed out in Blusun v. Italy, this was not
accepted in the absence of an express treaty provision or a clear understanding of the parties
to that treaty supporting the application of the inter se doctrine.’ This is consistent with
the premise that multilateral treaties apply prima facie equally between the parties pursuant
to the pacta sunt servanda rule under Article 26 VCLT, subject to express provisions to the

contrary.

The Tribunal therefore departs from the premise that like any other multilateral treaty the
ECT applies prima facie equally between the parties unless the contrary is supported by
express provision. To respond to Italy’s reliance on the inter se doctrine, the Tribunal will
interpret the ECT’s text in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation of the

VCLT.

First, the ECT’s Preamble recalls that the ECT sought to adopt “on a secure and binding
international legal basis” the commitments under the 1991 European Energy Charter, of
which the European Communities (“EC”) and the Euratom were signatories together with
the EC Member States at the time. Nothing in the European Energy Charter suggests that it
did not apply to EC Member States inter se. Like the EU, which by way of Article 47 of the

TEU*®® has been conferred legal personality, the EU Member States Parties to the ECT are

302.

equally independent entities with legal personality in their own rights. To recall the historical
origins of the inter se doctrine, the EU Member States are not Dominions or protectorates

from the EU, as illustrated, inter alia, by the principle of conferral.

Neither does the definition of “Contracting Party” under the ECT indicate an inter se
exclusion with respect to the EU Member States. Rather, “Contracting Party” is defined in
Article 1(2) ECT as a State or a “Regional Economic Integration Organisation” (“REIO”)
that has consented to be bound by the ECT. Pursuant to this definition, the ECT applies

equally between the Contracting Parties so defined.*”

Further, Article 2 ECT on the treaty’s purpose sets forth the objective “to promote long-term
cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits.” Article 2

contains no hint of an inter se exclusion either.

Second, the Decision in Annex 2(5) ECT on Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 provides, among other
matters, that an investment of an investor of a non-party to an Economic Integration
Agreement (“EIA”) is entitled to EIA treatment if it “has its registered office, central
administration or principal place of business within the EIA area,” and that if the investor
has only its registered office in the EIA, it has to present “an effective and continuous link
with the economy” of one of the EIA parties to be able to benefit from EIA treatment.
Contrary to Italy’s allegation, this Decision, together with the Declaration on Article 25,
contemplates different types of corporate presence within the EU, which cannot be

interpreted to exclude the ECT application from the EU Member States’ relations inter se.

Third, Italy’s and the European Commission’s submissions on the Member States’ lack of
competence to enter into ECT obligations lack support. Article 1(3) ECT’s definition of
REIO as an organisation to which its member States “have transferred competence over
certain matters” and Article 1(10) ECT’s definition of “Area” of an REIO as meaning “the
Areas of the member states of such Organisation” cannot be interpreted as referring to EU
Member States’ lack of competence to conclude the ECT. Neither could Article 25 ECT on
the MEN exception in relation to non-parties to EIAs be construed to imply the EU Member

States’ lack of competence to conclude the ECT. Further, Article 16 ECT setting forth a

409 See Blusun v. Italy (Exhibit RLA-1), | 280(2), and footnote 510.

116

non-derogation clause of more favourable provisions towards investors and investments in
relation to past and future international agreements cannot warrant this purported lack of

competence either.

303. Rather, the fact that EU Member States were required to participate in the ECT as a mixed
agreement implies that the EU Member States and the EU had overlapping or complementary
competences to conclude the ECT. As the Blusun tribunal rightly put it, “[t]he mere fact that
the EU is a party to the ECT does not mean that the EU Member States did not have
competence to enter into inter se obligations in the Treaty. Instead, the ECT seems to
contemplate that there would be overlapping competences.” *!° Thus, the ECT text does not
suggest that EU Member States have transferred exclusive competence over all matters of
investment and dispute resolution to the EU. If the EU Member States had envisaged not
having competence over inter se obligations, the EU would have included a declaration of
competence in light of other declarations made in relation to mixed agreements like the EU

Declaration of Competence to the FAO.*!!

continuous development, and the European Community will complete or amend this declaration, if necessary, in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the Agreement.”

Fourth, the Tribunal agrees with the Blusun tribunal that “nothing in the text of the ECT []
carves out or excludes issues arising between Member States.” *'? The Tribunal disagrees
with Italy that the inter se doctrine applies as a matter of “intent.” Rather, Articles 31 to

33 VCLT give preference to the treaty’s text as its main source of interpretation.

As discussed above, the ECT’s text in its context and in light of the ECT’s object and purpose
does not support an interpretation disconnecting relations between Member States from the
ECT. Italy’s argument on an alleged “disconnection” clause is thus unfounded. The ECT

Parties have included the following “disconnection” clause in relation to the Svalbard Treaty:

DECISION With respect to the Treaty as a whole

In the event of a conflict between the treaty concerning Spitsbergen of

9 February 1920 (the Svalbard Treaty) and the Energy Charter Treaty,

the treaty concerning Spitsbergen shall prevail to the extent of the

conflict, without prejudice to the positions of the Contracting Parties in

respect of the Svalbard Treaty. In the event of such conflict or a dispute

as to whether there is such conflict or as to its extent, Article 16 and

Part V of the Energy Charter Treaty shall not apply.
In light of the principle expressio unius est exlusio alterius according to which when one or
more things of a class are expressly referred to others of the same class are excluded, the
Tribunal considers that if the ECT Parties intended to provide an intra-EU “disconnection

clause,” they would have done it expressly as they did with the Svalbard Treaty.

Moreover, the Tribunal disagrees with Italy that “subsequent practice in the application” of
the ECT could support, together with the ECT’s context, Italy’s jurisdictional objection
within the meaning of Article 31(3)(b) VCLT. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT provides that “[a]ny
subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the
parties regarding its interpretation” shall be taken into account together with the treaty’s

context.

The Tribunal does not see how the following facts could support Italy’s argument on
Article 31(3)(b) VCLT: (i) that intra-EU ECT arbitrations had not been instituted before

2007; (ii) that certain of the EU Member States, which featured as respondents in investment

412 Blusun v. Italy (Exhibit RLA-1), | 280.

118

309.

310.

311.

arbitrations, have “consistently” objected to jurisdiction; and (iii) that no ECT Contracting
Party has ever intervened in favour of ECT jurisdiction in these arbitrations. These isolated
facts cannot establish the agreement of all ECT Contracting Parties within the meaning of
Article 31(3)(b). Neither could the European Commission’s Statement*!? in relation to the
2015 International Energy Charter be relevant because this is a different treaty. Rather, this
Statement highlights instead the fact that the EU has provided none in relation to the EU

Member States’ inter se relations under the ECT.

Differently from the ECT, other multilateral treaties like the 2005 Schengen III Agreement*!*
and the 1988 Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters*!> contain
express clauses on the relations between EU Member States inter se, which is not the case
of the ECT. In the absence of an express provision, the Tribunal finds that Italy’s allegation

that the ECT has not created obligations binding the EU Member States inter se fails.

Finally, the Tribunal dismisses Italy’s alternative argument that inter se obligations cannot
cover areas falling under EU competence. As demonstrated above, the fact that EU Member
States participated in the ECT as a mixed agreement implies that EU Member States and the

EU had overlapping or complementary competences over ECT matters.

The Statement submitted by the European Communities to the Secretariat of the Energy

Charter pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the Energy Charter Treaty provides as follows:

The European Communities are a regional economic integration
organisation within the meaning of the Energy Charter Treaty. The
Communities exercise the competences conferred on them by their
Member States through autonomous decision-making and judicial
institutions.

413 “It is declared that, due to the nature of the EU internal legal order, the text in Title II, Heading 4, of the International
Energy Charter on dispute settlement mechanisms cannot be construed so as to mean that any such mechanisms would
become applicable in relations between the European Union and its Member States, or between the said Member
States, on the basis of that text.” (Statement of Defense, 4 135).

414 See Exhibit CL-16RM, Article 47(1): “/. The provisions of this Convention shall apply only in so far as they are
compatible with European Union law. Should the European Union in future introduce arrangements affecting the
scope of this Convention, European Union law shall take precedence in applying the relevant provisions of this
Convention. The Contracting Parties may amend or replace the provisions of this Convention in view of those new

arrangements resulting from European Union law.”

415 See Exhibit CL-17RM, Article 27(2): “Notwithstanding the rules of the present Convention, those Parties which
are members of the European Economic Community shall apply in their mutual relations the common rules in
force in that Community.”.

119

The European Communities and their Member States have both
concluded the Energy Charter Treaty and are thus internationally

if ible for the fulfil of the obligations c ined therein, in
accordance with their respective competences.

 

The Communities and the Member States will, if necessary, determine
among them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings
initiated by an Investor of another Contracting Party. In such case,
upon the request of the Investor, the Communities and the Member
States concerned will make such determination within a period of 30
days (1).

The Court of Justice of the European Communities, as the judicial
institution of the Communities, is competent to examine any question
relating to the application and interpretation of the constituent treaties
and acts adopted thereunder, including international agreements
concluded by the Communities, which under certain conditions may be
invoked before the Court of Justice.

Any case brought before the Court of Justice of the European
Communities by an investor of another Contracting Party in application
of the forms of action provided by the constituent treaties of the
Communities falls under Article 26(2)(a) of the Energy Charter Treaty
(2). Given that the Communities’ legal system provides for means of
such action, the European Communities have not given their
unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international
arbitration or conciliation.

As far as international arbitration is concerned, it should be stated that
the provisions of the ICSID Convention do not allow the European
Communities to become parties to it. The provisions of the ICSID
Additional Facility also do not allow the Communities to make use of
them. Any arbitral award against the European Communities will be
implemented by the Communities’ institutions, in accordance with their
obligation under Article 26(8) of the Energy Charter Treaty."'6
312. Nothing in the text of this Statement suggests a derogation from this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Rather, the text above seems to refer to the allocation of liability between the EU and its
Member States, which is not at stake. The text’s reference to the ECJ’s competence does not
include any restrictive expression in relation to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The same

Statement also reads that that the European Communities cannot participate in ICSID

416 See Amicus Brief, | 76, and Annex EC-12.

120

315.

316.

proceedings. Thus, this Tribunal finds that the above Statement has no bearing on ECT

arbitral jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention in this arbitration.

In relation to Italy’s reliance on the ECT’s preparatory work as a “supplementary means” of
interpretation under Article 32 VCLT, the Tribunal considers this impermissible because the

terms of the ECT are clear against Italy’s interpretation of the ECT.*!”

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the ECT binds equally its Contracting
Parties including the EU Member States inter se pursuant to the pacta sunt servanda rule

under Article 26 VCLT.

(c) Have successive EU treaties affected the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
pursuant to Article 30 VCLT?
Italy sustains that the EU has evolved in a way that prevents ECT application to intra-EU
disputes, referring to Article 30 VCLT on successive treaties. According to the Respondent,
the Lisbon Treaty prevails over the ECT because they relate to the same subject-matter. Italy
makes, first, an argument based on the combined reading of Article 30(2) VCLT and
Article 16 ECT, and, second, an argument based on the /ex posterior rule under
Article 30(4)(a) VCLT, stating that the Lisbon Treaty prevails to the extent of any
incompatibility with the ECT. Belenergia objects to this by arguing that the Lisbon Treaty
and the ECT do not relate to the same subject matter, and that, even if they did, they are not

incompatible with each other.

Article 30 VCLT sets forth rules on the relationship between successive treaties relating to
the same subject-matter, including the /ex posterior rule that successive treaties prevail over
the earlier if the treaties are incompatible, as follows:

Article 30. APPLICATION OF SUCCESSIVE TREATIES RELATING TO THE SAME
SUBJECT-MATTER

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights
and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the
same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the
following paragraphs.

417 See Blusun v. Italy (Exhibit RLA-1), {[ 280(4).

121

317.

318.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the
provisions of that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation
under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its
provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to
the earlier one:

(a) As between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as
in paragraph 3;

(b) As between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only

one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs

their mutual rights and obligations [...]
Italy’s reliance*!* on the ILC Report on Fragmentation to argue that the Lisbon Treaty and
the ECT have the same subject-matter is unwarranted. According to the ILC Report on
Fragmentation, the “test” on whether two treaties deal with the same subject-matter should
be carried out on a case-by-case basis seeking to establish “an institutional connection
between ‘chains’ or clusters of treaties that are linked institutionally and that States parties
envisage as part of the same concerted effort.” This Tribunal does not find that this
connection or concerted effort exists because the EU treaties do not provide for investor-

State arbitration under the ICSID Rules.

Even if the Tribunal would consider that the Lisbon Treaty and the ECT dealt with the same
subject-matter, it would note that the combined reading of Article 16 ECT and
Article 30(2) VCLT could not lead to ECT derogation as the earlier treaty. Article 16 sets
forth a non-derogation clause of more favourable provisions towards investors and
investments in relation to past and future international agreements, as follows:
Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international

agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of
Part III or V of this Treaty,

418 See Statement of Defense, {If 80-81.

122

319.

321

>

321.

419 On s

(1) nothing in Part ITI or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate
from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any
right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement;
and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any
right to dispute lution with respect thereto under this Treaty,

 

 

 

where any _such_provision_is_more favourable to the Investor or

Investment. (emphases added)
Because the ECT provides for a more favourable dispute resolution mechanism this cannot
be derogated by the Lisbon Treaty. Article 26 ECT confers upon investors of a Contracting
Party the right to directly initiate international arbitration such as ICSID arbitration against
another Contracting Party, after a short waiting period with the possibility of raising claims
based on ECT’s rights and obligations, directly effective before an arbitral tribunal. The EU
judicial system does not offer a similar option for investors, which have to act in the courts
of the State that allegedly damaged their investment, under national procedural rules, in the
language admitted in these courts and with the obligation to engage local lawyers. Hence,
the conflict rule under Article 16 ECT confirms, as a lex specialis, the investor’s right to
international arbitration under Article 26 ECT, as being a more favourable dispute resolution

mechanism.

The Tribunal is unconvinced by Italy’s Article 30(4)(a) argument on the /ex posterior rule in
case of incompatibility between earlier and successive treaties. The Tribunal finds
complementarity rather than incompatibility between the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty, from
a substantive and a procedural perspective.*!? From a substantive law perspective, EU rules
establishing the internal market are complementary to ECT rules, including rules prohibiting

discrimination.

From a procedural perspective, this Tribunal finds that Article 26 ECT on investor-State

arbitration is complementary rather than incompatible to the remedies of the EU legal order.

ibstantive complementarity, see Blusun v. Italy (Exhibit RLA-1), { 286. See also, on the presumption of

  

compatibility or improbable incompatibility, Electrabel v. Hungary (Exhibit_CL-27M), {| 4.135-4.141;
Isolux v. Spain (Exhibit CL-6RM), (f 644-645.

123

The Tribunal is well aware of the ECJ’s Achmea*”® decision holding Article 8 of the
Netherlands-Czech and Slovak Federal Republic BIT inconsistent with Articles 267 and
344 TFEU. According to the ECJ, an offer to arbitrate by the EU Member States such as the

one under Article 8 of this BIT:

(a) violates Article 344 TFEU which sets forth the principle that “Member States
undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application
of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for” in the

EU treaties;*7! and

(b) removes dispute settlement from the jurisdiction of EU Member States and from
the EU judicial system with “mechanisms capable of ensuring the full
effectiveness of the rules of the EU” such as referring questions of EU law for a

preliminary ruling by the ECJ, in breach of Article 267 TFEU.*
322. Yet 58 of the ECJ’s decision in Achmea reads as follows:

In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling
within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of
the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of
EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is
not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement
which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States. Article 8 of
the BIT is such as to call into question not only the principle of mutual
trust between the Member States but also the preservation of the
particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured by the
preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is
not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation
referred to in paragraph 34 above.*> (emphasis added)

   

323. First, the Achmea decision does not concern a treaty to which the EU itself participates as a
Party. The ECJ expressly relies above on the fact that the BIT was concluded between the
EU Member States without the participation of the EU. This Tribunal agrees with the
Masdar v. Spain** tribunal that the ECJ’s reasoning cannot be transposed to the ECT, which

420 See Exhibit CL-166RM.

“21 See Exhibit CL-166RM, {ff 32, 60.

22 See Ex L-166RM, {ff 43, 45, 55, 60.

“23 Exhibit CL-166RM.

24 See Masdar v. Spain (Exhibit CL-179RM), {| 679.

    

124

is a mixed agreement with the EU as a Contracting Party. Italy is pre-empted from relying
on the principle of sincere cooperation between the Union and the Member States under

Article 4(3) of the TEU*> when the EU is a Party to the ECT.

324. Second, this Tribunal takes note of the ECJ’s perception of inconsistency of the Member
States’ offer to arbitrate with Articles 267 and 344 TFEU. Nevertheless, this is the
perspective from the EU legal order. As determined in {| 290-292 above on the applicable
law, EU law can be applied to the extent that the ECT regime permits its application. This
Tribunal considers that different international law regimes can communicate to the extent
that their own rules permit it. This Tribunal has been constituted and exercises its jurisdiction
under the ECT regime to which the EU is a Contracting Party. A treaty means what it says.
No text or conflict rule under ECT suggests that an ECJ’s decision pertaining to the EU legal
order could derogate from the offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT as pertaining to the

ECT as an independent international law regime.

325. Moreover, the European Commission’s Communication*”® on the Protection of Intra-EU
Investment following the ECJ’s Achmea decision presents an EU legal order perspective.
Even from an EU legal order perspective a communication of the European Commission is

a non-binding instrument, not to mention that it cannot bind an ICSID Tribunal.

326. As to the Member States’ Declarations dated 15 January 2019*” and 16 January 2019,478
Luxembourg is only signatory of the 16 January 2019 Declaration, together with Finland,
Malta, Slovenia and Sweden, while Italy is signatory of the 15 January 2019 Declaration,
together with other 21 Member States. Italy’s declaration provides that the ECT, to which
the Union is a Contracting Party, is an integral part of the EU legal order and thus need to be

compatible with the EU Treaties and that interpreting the ECT investor-State arbitration

425 See Treaty on the European Union (Exhibit REX-2B).

clause as applicable between Member States “would be incompatible with the Treaties and

thus would have to be disapplied.”*”?

327. Yet, Luxembourg’s declaration provides that it would be inappropriate to express views on

the compatibility between EU law and the intra-EU application of the ECT, as follows:

The Achmea case concerns the interpretation of EU law in relation to
an investor-state arbitration clause in a bilateral investment treaty
between Member States. The Member States note that the Achmea
judgment is silent on the investor-state arbitration clause in the Energy
Charter Treaty. A number of international arbitration tribunals post
the Achmea judgment have concluded that the Energy Charter Treaty
contains an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between EU
Member States. This interpretation is currently contested before a
national court in a Member State [Set-aside proceeding in Svea Court
of Appeal, Case No 4658-18, Novenergia II- Energy & Environment
(SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SI CAR vs the Kingdom of
Spain, SCC Arbitration (20 15/06)]. Against this background, the
Member States underline the importance of allowing for due proce

with Union law_of the intra EU application of the Energy Charter

 

Treaty,*°

328. Regardless of the Declarations above, the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence as per
Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention. The undertakings of the signatories of the
declaration signed by Italy use the future tense not only in relation to the future of intra-EU
BITs but also in relation to the ECT, as follows:

[...] 5. In light of the Achmea judgment, Member States will terminate
all bilateral investment treaties concluded between them by means of a

plurilateral_treaty_or, where _that_is mutually recognised _as_more
expedient, bilaterally.

[...] 8. Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instruments
of ratification, approval or acceptance of that plurilateral treaty or of

any bilateral treaty t inating bilateral investment treaties between
Member States no later than 6 December 2019. They will inform each
other and the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union
in due time of any obstacle they encounter, and of measures they
envisage in order to overcome that obstacle.

9. Beyond actions concerning the Energy Charter Treaty based on this
declaration, Member States together with the Commission will discuss

without undue delay whether any additional steps are necessary to draw
all the consequences from the Achmea jud; in relation to the intra-

EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.
329. The language in the future tense above is clear that neither the intra-EU BITs nor the ECT

have been terminated.

330. More, Luxembourg’s declaration as the Contracting Party of the investor’s nationality in this
arbitration differs from Italy’s declaration, the Contracting Party hosting the investment, in
relation to the compatibility between the ECT and EU law. The Tribunal does not see how
these declarations could be reconciled and thus cannot apply them in the present case as
Italy’s unilateral declaration enshrined in the Member States’ Declaration dated
15 January 2019**! cannot trump the inter se obligations under the ECT binding on Italy and
Luxembourg. Thus, Italy’s request for termination or suspension of the proceedings dated

14 February 2019 cannot stand on the basis of these declarations.

331. Third, Italy’s reference to the MOX Plant (Commission v. Ireland) case is not convincing
because it omits that the ECJ relied on Article 232 UNCLOS in its reasoning in this case.
The Commission brought infringement proceedings against Ireland for having instituted
arbitration proceedings against the UK on the basis of Chapter VII of UNCLOS. Although
the UNCLOS is a mixed agreement like the ECT, Article 282 UNCLOS provides that dispute
settlement procedures under general, regional or bilateral agreements “shall apply in lieu of
the procedures provided for in this Part [i.e. in UNCLOS], unless the parties to the dispute

otherwise agree.” The ECJ expressly referred to Article 282, as follows:

It follows from Article 282 of the Convention that, as it provides for
procedures resulting in binding decisions in respect of the resolution of
43! See Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019 on the Legal
Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union,

signed by 22 Members States including the Italian Republic (Annex to Italy’s Letter to the Tribunal dated
14 February 2019).

disputes between Member States, the system for the resolution of
disputes set out in the EC Treaty must in principle take precedence over
that contained in Part XV of the Convention.”

The ECT contains no equivalent provision to Article 282 UNCLOS.

Finally, the Tribunal is unconvinced that ECJ’s Opinion 1/09 bears on this dispute because
Opinion 1/09 concerned a mere draft agreement on the European and Community Patents
before the EU, its Member States, and third countries could even accede to it. Conversely,
the EU and its Member States signed and ratified the ECT on the basis of decisions by the
European Council and the Commission.*** In any case, Opinion 1/09 enshrines a perspective

from the EU legal order that cannot be transposed to the ECT’s regime.

Thus, the Tribunal finds that successive EU treaties have not affected the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction pursuant to Article 30 VCLT.

(d) Has there been an inter se modification of the ECT under
Article 41 VCLT affecting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction?
The Respondent argues that the Lisbon Treaty is an inter se agreement between the EU
Member States modifying the ECT pursuant to Article 41 VCLT. Belenergia objects to this,
relying on Article 46 ECT prohibiting reservations and on Article 41(2) VCLT requiring

notification of modification.

Article 41 VCLT provides for the possibility of an inter se modification (a) when this
possibility is provided in the treaty, and (b) when, in the absence of a modification provision,
the inter se modification does not affect the enjoyment of third States parties and does not
derogate from a provision whose derogation is incompatible with the object and purpose of
the treaty, in which case notification of modification is required, as follows:

Article 41 AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY MULTILATERAL TREATIES BETWEEN
CERTAIN OF THE PARTIES ONLY

482 See MOX Plant (Commission v. Ireland) (Exhibit REX-9), {{ 125.

83 See Electrabel v. Hungary (Exhibit CL-27M), { 4.135: “The legal basis on which the European Union became a
party to the ECT is set out in Council Decision 94/998/EC (as to signature) and Council and Commission Decision
98/I8I/EC, ECSC, Euratom (as to ratification).”

128

1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an
agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

(a) The possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty;
or

(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights
under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;

(ii) Does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is
incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of
the treaty as a whole.

2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph I(a) the treaty otherwise
provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their
intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the treaty
for which it provides.

337. On the possibility of modification under Article 41(1)(a) above, the ECT expressly provides

33)

~

in Article 46 that “[nJo reservations may be made to this Treaty.” Hence, failing notification
pursuant to Article 41(2) VCLT, the Tribunal cannot favour Italy’s argument on the alleged

inter se modification.

(e) Could the Tribunal refuse to exercise its jurisdiction because of an
alleged risk of non-recognition and non-enforcement of the award?
Italy argues that there is a risk of award non-recognition and non-enforcement after the
Achmea decision, citing Article 42 ICC Arbitration Rules (effective 1 March 2017) and
Article 32.2 LCIA Arbitration Rules (effective 1 October 2014) on the Tribunal’s obligation

to render an enforceable award.

This arbitration is based on the ICSID Convention, which establishes a self-contained system
independent from national legal systems. ICSID awards may be subject to limited annulment
grounds under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and it is within this legal framework that
this Tribunal must be concerned by the enforceability of its award. Under the
ICSID Convention, the recognition obligation is unconditional under Article 54(1), although

enforcement of pecuniary obligations is subject to the law of the place of enforcement under

129

Be

Article 54(3). The Tribunal therefore finds that, at this stage, Italy’s concerns are unfounded

in relation to award recognition and hypothetical in relation to award enforcement.

aK

. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Italy’s EU jurisdictional objection in light of
the following findings: (a) EU law can apply as part of international law and “where relevant
should apply European law as such’** to the extent that the ECT regime permits this; (b) the
ECT binds equally between its Contracting Parties including the EU Member States inter se
pursuant to the pacta sunt servanda rule under Article 26 VCLT; (c) successive EU treaties
have not affected the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as per Article 30 VCLT; (d) failing notification
pursuant to Article 41(2) VCLT, a purported inter se modification of the ECT cannot affect
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; and (e) Italy’s concerns are unfounded in relation to award

recognition and hypothetical in relation to award enforcement at this stage.

(2) Do the Exclusive Jurisdiction Clauses under the GSE Conventions Bar
Jurisdiction?
. Italy submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the broad terms of the choice of
forum clause conferring exclusive jurisdiction upon Rome courts under the
GSE Conventions would trigger the fork-in-the-road rule under Articles 26(2) and

26(3) ECT. Belenergia objects to Italy’s position.

. The choice of forum clause under the GSE Conventions (on feed-in tariffs and minimum

prices) confers jurisdiction upon Rome courts, as follows:

Any proceedings deriving from or in any case connected to the
interpretation or the execution of this Agreement and connected
documents shall be settled before the Court of Rome.*>

. Article 26(2)(b) and (3) stipulate that the ECT Contracting Parties give their “unconditional

consent’ to arbitration except if an investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution “in

484 Blusun v. Italy (Exhibit RLA-1), 278.

follows:
[...] (2) Ifsuch disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of

either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party
party to the dispute;

(b) in_accordance with _any applicable, previously agreed dispute

344, The Tribunal considers that the above provision does not state that the mere existence of a
forum selection clause in a contract would preclude Italy’s consent to arbitrate.
Article 26(3)(b)(i) and Annex ID to the ECT, read together with Italy’s Statement of 17
December 1997 in relation to Annex ID, makes it clear that the fork-in-the-road provision
under the ECT concerns a “previously submitted” dispute or the “resubmission” of the same
dispute to arbitration, not the mere possibility of submitting a dispute in the future to another

dispute settlement procedure.

34:

uw

Article 26(3)(b)(i) stipulates that the Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID “do not give such
unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute” as per

Article 26(2)(b). Further, Annex ID to the ECT includes Italy in the List of Contracting

347.

Parties not allowing an investor to resubmit the same dispute to international arbitration at a

later stage under Article 26.

Were the Tribunal to interpret Article 26 as precluding consent to arbitrate when there is a
choice of forum clause, it would render Article 26 futile. Even if a contract does not provide
for the choice of forum, it is subject to the applicable default rules on conflicts of jurisdiction
determining the competent forum. Hence, Italy’s position would make it impossible for an
investor having entered into any contract related to an investment dispute to pursue ICSID

arbitration under the ECT, even if this contract did not provide for a choice of forum.

Italy’s Statement of 17 December 1997 in relation to Annex ID is clear that the mere presence
of a forum selection clause in a contract cannot trigger the fork-in-the-road provision under
Article 26. Rather, this Statement states that only a dispute “already submitted” or a
previously agreed dispute settlement procedure already “followed” could trigger the fork-in-

the-road provision:

In accordance with Article 26(3)(b)(ii), Italy declares that it does not
allow for a dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party to be
submitted for international arbitration or conciliation, provided that an
Investor has: a) already_sub d_the dispute Italian _courts_or
administrative tribunals; or b) followed_an_applicable, previously
agreed procedure for the settlement of disputes. In this respect a
distinction must be made between two options: 1) if a resolution of the
dispute has not yet been made_by internal judicial or conciliation
bodies, the Investor may revoke his judicial action or arbitral procedure
by procedural or lateral renouncement and apply to other forms _o,

dispute settlement; 2) if a resolution or any formal or legal document of
execution has already been made to settle the dispute, conciliation or
international arbitration is no longer possible. The above statements
are based either on the principle of ‘ne bis in idem’ (to avoid two
judgments being awarded for the settlement of the same dispute: one by
the arbitration and the other by the court of law), or on the principle of
incontrovertibility of “decisum” which is binding on the parties in their
substantial relations without giving them any possibility, during the
procedure or after it, to use the normal means of appeal.**° (emphases

S

It is also clear from Italy’s Statement above that even if a dispute had “already [been]
submitted” or a previously agreed dispute settlement procedure had already been “followed,”
the fork-in-the-road provision would not be triggered if the “resolution of the dispute has not
yet been made” and the investor withdraws from this procedure. In other words, Italy’s
Statement expressly allows an investor to file a suit and later withdraw from it without
triggering the fork-in-the-road provision under Article 26(3)(b) ECT. In any event, Italy has
not argued, let alone demonstrated that the invested PV companies of Belenergia have filed
suits before Rome courts based on each of the choice of law clauses of each and every GSE

Convention on feed-in tariffs and minimum prices.

Thus, Article 26 ECT, interpreted in light of Italy’s Statement of 17 December 1997, is clear
that the fork-in-the-road provision can only be triggered when the investor actually elects a
dispute settlement method by instituting proceedings before choosing to commence
international arbitration. This reflects the generally accepted view of fork-in-the-road
clauses,**’ and their underlying purpose to avoid the institution of multiple proceedings in
multiple fora. Italy has not satisfied its burden of proving that Belenergia seeks to institute

multiple proceedings in different fora.

Even if it were the case—quod non—Belenergia is not a party to the choice of forum clauses
under the GSE Conventions. Thus, there would be no identity of parties capable of triggering

a fork-in-the-road clause.

Thus, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over Belenergia’s claims and dismisses Italy’s

jurisdictional objection based on the choice of forum clause under the GSE Conventions.

Alternatively, Italy argues that the choice of forum clause under the GSE Conventions
precludes Belenergia’s umbrella clause claim under Article 10(1) ECT. Article 10(1) ECT
provides that “[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into
with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.” As the
Tribunal has found above that the fork-in-the-road clause under Article 26 has not been

triggered, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Belenergia’s claims, including the umbrella

437 See, for example, Christoph Schreuer, “Travelling the BIT Route: Of Waiting Periods, Umbrella Clauses and Forks
in the Road”, Journal of World Investment & Trade, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Exhibit CL-52RM), p. 248: “The domestic
proceeding must have been instituted prior to the choice of international arbitration. [...]”

clause claim. It is undisputed that the dispute relates to Belenergia’s investment in Italian
territory and purported breaches of ECT obligations pertaining to Part III of this treaty. Thus,
Italy’s alternative argument hinges on the admissibility of the umbrella claim, rather than

jurisdiction.

Italy relies on the approach taken in SGS v. Philippines and BIVAC v. Paraguay in support
of its position that Belenergia’s umbrella clause claims are contract claims subject to the

jurisdiction of Rome courts.

First, the SGS v. Philippines and the BIVAC v. Paraguay cases are inapposite because in this
arbitration each invested PV company concluded with the GSE Conventions on feed-in
tariffs and minimum prices for each of their PV plants. The Claimant Belenergia is not privy
to the GSE Conventions. Conversely, in SGS v. Philippines**® the claimant SGS had
concluded with the Philippines a contract for a comprehensive import supervision service,
while the claimant BIVAC in BIVAC v. Paraguay*® had concluded with Paraguay’s
Ministry of Finance a contract for the provision of technical services for pre-shipment
inspection of imports. There is no reason why the Tribunal should not consider Belenergia
as having different legal personality from its PV companies, let alone disregard its legal

personality deeming it a party to the GSE Convention.

Second, even if the Tribunal were to consider these case decisions relevant (quod non), it
cannot agree with the approach taken in SGSv. Philippines. According to the
SGS v. Philippines tribunal, the claims for money founded on the contract between SGS and
the Philippines were inadmissible because they were contract claims subject to the choice of
forum clause under the relevant contract. This approach would automatically deprive the

umbrella clause under Article 10(1) ECT of its meaning because each and every contract,

134

even one without a choice of forum clause, would inherently be subject to a State court based

on default rules on conflicts of jurisdiction

356. Rather, the Tribunal considers the SGS v. Paraguay approach on the source of the umbrella
claim being the treaty even if it requires a showing of contractual breach.“° According to
the SGS v. Paraguay tribunal, declining to hear the umbrella claim by virtue of a contractual
forum selection clause “would place the Tribunal at risk of failing to carry out its mandate
under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.”**' As the SGS v. Paraguay tribunal put it, one

cannot presume that umbrella clause claims are co-extensive with claims under the contract:

[...] Claimant's Article 11 claims are not co-extensive with claims
under the Contract, and they are not necessarily disposed of by the four
corners of the Contract. Claimant has advanced Article 1] claims not
only for breach of the Contract’s payment obligation but also for breach
of alleged subsequent commitments by Paraguay’s representatives.
Whether or not both might be within the reach of the Contract’s broadly
worded forum selection clause, the latter cannot be judged under the
Contract alone. Whether Paraguayan representatives made the alleged
commitments, whether those commitments could be relied upon by SGS,
and whether the commitments were breached, must all be decided by
this Tribunal with reference to the Treaty and the applicable bodies of
law specified under it. Accordingly, it would sweep too broadly to say
that all umbrella clause claims—and, in particular, all of the umbrella
clause claims before us—can be disposed of on contractual grounds by
the contractual forum. [...}*?

357. Here, Belenergia has advanced the umbrella clause claim irrespective of the GSE
Conventions’ “contractual” character, arguing that these Conventions contain specific
commitments towards Belenergia, breached by Italy through the adoption of legislative and

regulatory acts unilaterally modifying these Conventions.**

Third, having affirmed jurisdiction over the umbrella claim, this Tribunal “would have to

odd

have very strong cause indeed to decline to exercise it,”*** which is not the case.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Italy’s jurisdictional objection that the choice
of forum clause under the GSE Conventions bars ECT jurisdiction over Belenergia’s claims

and finds that Belenergia’s umbrella clause claim under Article 10(1) ECT is admissible.

(3) Has the Claimant Complied with the Waiting Period under Articles 26(1) and
26(2) ECT in relation to the Imbalance Costs Claim?
Italy submits that Belenergia raised the imbalance costs claim only with its Statement of
Claim of 14 December 2016, arguing that the Amicable Solution Letter dated
8 December 2014” and the Request for Arbitration dated 30 July 2015 do not refer to
imbalance costs imposed by AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016.

Conversely, Belenergia argues that its Amicable Solution Letter satisfies the 3-month
waiting period and that, even if it did not, starting negotiations would be futile in light of
Italy’s unwillingness to negotiate other claims, adding that this period would have elapsed at
the time of the Hearing. According to Belenergia, requiring the Claimant to commence
separate ICSID proceedings on the imbalance costs claim would lead to inefficiency and

would not serve the best interests of justice.

Article 26(1) and (2) of the ECT provide that an investment dispute between a Contracting
Party and an investor shall be, if possible, settled amicably within a 3-month period from the
date either party requested amicable settlement. Only then the investor may submit its
dispute to international arbitration, as follows:

Article 26: Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a
Contracting Party

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of

the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the
former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such di. cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which

either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

 

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party
party to the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

 

 

(3) @ Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting
Pari

ereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with
the provisions of this Article. [...] (emphases added)

 

363. The question is whether Belenergia’s Amicable Solution Letter dated 8 December 2014
satisfies the requirement that the parties engage in negotiations, if possible, to settle their
dispute amicably as per Article 26 ECT. Irrespective of whether in this arbitration
Belenergia challenges the imbalance costs imposed by AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016, it is
clear from the Amicable Solution Letter predating this Resolution that there was already a

dispute between the Parties in relation to imbalance costs:

[...] With reference to the renewable energy market and specifically
the photovoltaic sector, the Italian Government has approved, during
recent years, various retroactive and discriminatory changes to the
legal and taxation regime for solar plants, causing a_ significant
detriment to the economic use, enjoyment and value of the relevant
investments.

[...] Indeed, the Investors owning many PV plants with a capacity of up
to 1 MW benefiting from the mandatory purchase regime were also very
much affected by the change of take-off regime: first with the decreasing
of the amount of minimum guaranteed prices (through the AEEG
Resolution 618/2013) and afterwards with the introduction of a system
according to which the minimum price shall be equal to the relevant
applicable hourly zone prices (through the art.1, par.2 of the
"Destinazlone Italia" Decree). Moreover since 2013 the operators
benefiting from the di y purchase regime, are charged from the

GSE of the imbalance of costs (so called "costi di sbilanciamento") and

137

of the costs originating from the participation of the GSE in the intra-
day market (mercato infragiornarliero).

These measures along with the Law have clearly affected and strongly
modified the original legal framework according to which the Investors
have made their investment in Italy and have relied upon.

In particular the investors relied on a feed-in tariffs system based
(according to Law no. 28/2011, Implementing Directive no. 28 of 2009
on the promotion of renewable energy) [...]

We, therefore, take this opportunity to express our disappointment with
regard to the changes in law introduced to the applicable legislation,
lastly by the Law on Conversion, which substantially and negatively
affect the legal framework applicable to the investments that the
Investors have made in the photovoltaic sector.

 

In light of the above, Italy's legislative actions are in breach of its
obligations, provided for under the Energy Charter Treaty (the "ECT"),
and have caused, and are continuing to cause, serious, permanent and
substantial damages to the Investors’ investments strongly affecting the
economic value of the investments.

This also in light of the fact that Italy undertook, according to the ECT,
to grant a stable legal framework for energy investments without
affecting the economic use, enjoyment and value of the investment made.
Moreover, the ECT protects foreign investors, as the Investors, from,
inter alia arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory actions such as those
described above and included under the Decree.

Therefore, should an amicable solution of the matter be not reached,
also as stated according to Article 26 of the ECT, Investors reserve the
right to protect their interests at all appropriate premises, in particular
starting an international arbitration proceeding against the
Government of Italy under the rules provided for in article 26 of the
ECT.

[...] In_light of the above, the undersigned confirm their availability to
negotiate _an_alternative solution to the matter and hereby formall

request You to start negotiations, also according to Article 26 of the

ECT, to the aim of obtaining an amicable solution of the dispute.

 

 

 

Investors would be delighted to schedule a meeting with You at your
earliest convenience.

For the avoidance of any doubt, in case said negotiations may have
negative outcome, Investors reserve the right to adopt any legal action

in order to protect their right and interests.

138

364. The Amicable Solution Letter above broadly refers to regulatory changes affecting solar

365.

Finally, we underline that the present letter shall not be, in any case,
deemed, nor indirectly and/or partially, as Investors’ (and/or company's
belonging to Investors 'group) waiver to any right and/or action they
may be entitled to according to applicable legislation and/or according

energy producers, making express reference to “imbalance costs.”“*7 Hence, the Tribunal
considers that this express reference to imbalance costs later continued by way of AEEG
Resolution No. 444/2016 suffices for the purposes of the three-month waiting period
requirement under Article 26(2) ECT.

The Eiser v. Spain tribunal faced a similar issue, having dismissed the three-month waiting
period objection under Article 26 ECT. According to the Eiser tribunal, the claimants’
notices of dispute listed several changes to the legal and economic regime for solar plants
leading to a single dispute that did “not require additional piecemeal requests for amicable
settlement of new issues or elements arising in the course of an ongoing dispute following a

request for negotiations,” as follows:

The particular measures involved in Respondent's objection — Law
24/2013, RD 413/2014, and Order IET/1045/2014 — are not a new
dispute or disputes triggering Article 26’s requirement for another
request for negotiations. Articles 26(1) and (2) do not require additional
piecemeal requests for amicable settlement of new issues or elements
arising in the course an ongoing dispute following a request for
negotiations. It would be unreasonable and inefficient in case like this,
involving an evolving situation, to interpret Article 26 to require the
dispute to be carved into multiple slices, with each new development
requiring an additional request for negotiations and a subsequent
request for a separate additional arbitration. The situation is akin to
that in cases such as Enron v. Argentina, where Enron was found to
have only a single dispute regarding provincial taxation, and did not
need to give further notice or observe a cooling off period before adding
other provinces to its claim.8

relation to Italy’s solar energy legal and regulatory framework, with express reference to
imbalance costs. It would be unreasonable and inefficient to carve a single dispute into
multiple slices by requiring Belenergia to make an additional request for negotiations when
(i) the Amicable Solution Letter already referred to imbalance costs; (ii) Belenergia clearly
has a single dispute against Italy in relation to its regulatory and legal framework applying
to PV plants; and (iii) the three-month waiting period had already elapsed at the time of the
Hearing on 26 to 29 March 2018.

Although the Parties have not referred to ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 in their written and oral
pleadings, this provision stipulates that an incidental or additional claim can be introduced
no later than in the reply. ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 provides that:

(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an

incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of

the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is

within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the
jurisdiction of the Centre.

(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than

in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the countermemorial,

unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the

ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party,

authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the

proceeding. [...]
For instance, the CMS v. Argentina tribunal accepted an additional claim brought by CMS,
relying on ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, finding that the incidental or additional claim was “so
close as to require the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of
the dispute, the object being to dispose of all the grounds of dispute arising out of the same

subject matter.”*? In the present case, the imbalance costs claim was introduced before

inadmissible and the Tribunal must abstain to exercise jurisdiction. If this is not the case, the objection must be
dismissed since (i) it can be admitted that the cooling-off period will have elapsed at the time the Tribunal’s decision
is taken and (ii) it would be totally artificial and unreasonably heavy to request the Claimant to lodge new applications
directed against facts which are but the continuation of those at stake in the initial Application. [...]”

under Rule 40(2), not to mention that it could be considered an “incidental or additional
claim” so close to the dispute requiring its adjudication to achieve the final settlement of the

dispute.

369. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Italy’s jurisdictional /admissibility objection
that Belenergia has not complied with the 3-month waiting period under Articles 26(1) and

(2) of the ECT in relation to the imbalance costs claim.

(4) Are Imbalance Costs a “Taxation Measure” Falling Outside the ECT’s Scope?

370. The Respondent submits that the imbalance costs claim falls within the meaning of the
taxation carve-out under Article 21 ECT. According to the Respondent, the “Taxation
Measure” definition under Article 21(7) is broad, referring to “an open-ended category of
measures” and requiring that a “Taxation Measure” have “fiscal” character and be contained
in domestic legislation or in a treaty. Italy further submits that the “fiscal” character of a
measure is defined by reference to Italian domestic law, classifying a “fiscal” measure as tax
(“imposta”), fee (“tassa’”), or contribution (“contributo”), irrespective of its name. Italy
relies on Italy’s Constitutional Court Decision No 238/2009*°! defining taxation measures
as having the following features: (a) mandatory contribution; (b) absence of exact reciprocity
between the parties; and (c) the contribution is linked to public spending with a relevant
economic purpose, and on Article 23 of the Italian Constitution requiring that taxation

measures be established by law.

118. The Tribunal is of the view that, in the instant case, the subject-matter of the dispute is the alleged loss by CMS
of its investment in TGN caused, it is argued, by the breaches by the Republic of Argentina of its obligation under the
BIT. Such breaches relate, in the Claimant's view, to the interference of organs of the Argentine State with the tariff
regime applicable to TGN, which was first subjected to deferral of adjustments, followed by a freeze, culminating in
the abrogation of that adjustment and the removal of the right to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars and then express
them in convertible pesos at the time of billing.

119. Note B to Arbitration Rule 40 supports the conclusion that the post-July 2001 events give rise to incidental or

  

additional claims. There is no doubt, in the mind of the Tribunal, that the claim resulting from those events is ‘so close
as to require the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute, the object being to
dispose of all the grounds of dispute arising out of the same subject matter.”

372.

On the other hand, the Claimant objects to Italy’s position that the imbalance costs claim
falls within the meaning of the taxation carve-out under Article 21 ECT, in light of the
ordinary meaning of Article 21(7) ECT defining the term “Taxation Measure”. According
to the Claimant, the references in Article 21(7) to “taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party” and to “taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or
of any other international agreement” imply that only specific provisions of Italy’s tax
legislation or treaties could trigger the “Taxation Measure” exception and should therefore
be interpreted restrictively. The Claimant adds that imbalance costs is not a “Taxation
Measure” because they are not “sufficiently clearly connected” to Italy’s taxation law, in

addition to being arbitrarily imposed by Italy.

Article 21 ECT provides, among others, that nothing in the ECT shall create rights or impose

obligations in relation to “Taxation Measures” of the Contracting Parties, as follows:
Article 21: Taxation

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency
between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article
shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

[...] (3) Article 10(2) and (7) [on NT and MEN] shail apply to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties other than those on income or on
capital, except that such provisions shall not apply to:

(a) impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to advantages
accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any
convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph
(7)(a}(ii) or resulting from membership of any Regional Economic
Integration Organisation; or

(b) any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of
taxes, except where the measure arbitrarily discrimi against an
Investor of another Contracting Party or arbitrarily restricts benefits
accorded under the Investment provisions of this Treaty.

[J

(7) For the purposes of this Article:

 

(a) The term “Taxation Measure” includes:

142

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the d ic law of the Contractin;
Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein;
and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance
of double taxation or of any other international agreement or
arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound. [...] (emphases
added)

373. Article 21(7)(a)(i) ECT above defines the term “Taxation Measure” as to include “any
provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party.” “[I]ncludes” under
Article 21(7)(a) in light of its ordinary meaning should be interpreted as to mean that what
is listed as a “Taxation Measure” in the same provision is not exhaustive. For example, the
Cambridge Dictionary defines the verb “include” in a non-restrictive way so as “to contain
something as a part of something else, or to make something part of something else” and “to
have something smaller as a part of it, or to make something smaller part of it.” Thus, the

Tribunal considers that Article 21(7)(a)(i) ECT cannot be restrictively interpreted.

374. The Tribunal considers that imbalance costs imposed by AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016
should be interpreted as falling within the meaning of a “Taxation Measure” under
Article 21(7)(a)(i) ECT because they should be considered a “Taxation Measure” pursuant
to Italian domestic law. Established by AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016, imbalance costs
satisfy the Italian law requirement that taxation measures have to be established by law

pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Constitution?

375. Moreover, the Italian Constitutional Court has defined taxation measures as such measures
(a) requiring a mandatory contribution (b) in the absence of exact reciprocity between the

parties (c) linked to public spending with a relevant economic purpose.*** This indicates that

ifulness of the obligation, the lack of a relationship of reciprocal nature between the parties and the connection of
that benefit to public expenditure in relation to an economically relevant precondition [...}”

substance prevails over form and that the name of the measure (nomen iuris) is irrelevant.*°°
Imbalance costs are mandatory and non-reciprocated, levied from a general category of
energy producers (originally levied from the general category of consumers), and linked to

public spending with transmission and dispatching services.

376. The Tribunal cannot agree with Belenergia’s argument that imbalance costs are arbitrary and
thus not covered by the Article 21(1) “Taxation Measure” carve-out, which applies only to
bona fide taxation measures. Rather, the Tribunal finds that imbalance costs established by
AEEG Resolution No. 444/2016 should qualify as a bona fide taxation measure falling
within the meaning of Article 21 ECT.

377. The present arbitration differs from the Yukos arbitration*® where the arbitral tribunal

identified extraordinary circumstances indicating that Russia’s taxation measures were not
“bona fide.” As the Isolux v. Spain tribunal put it, it is not easy to rebut the presumption that
taxation measures are bona fide because what matters is the real purpose of the measure

irrespective of how it is presented by the domestic legislator, as follows:

It is not easy to rebut the presumption that taxation measures enacted
by a State are bona fide. As stated by the tribunal in RosInvestCo,
“States have a wide latitude in imposing and enforcing taxation law,
even if resulting in substantial deprivation without compensation.” The
cases Yukos and RosInvestCo compare bona fide measures with
measures adopted to destroy a party or a political adversary. The
criticism made to the IVPEE by the Claimant does not reveal such
extreme purpose. The economic consequences or effects of the IVPEE
may be obscure or debatable, but this is not a sufficient argument to
conclude that the IVPEE is a taxation measure adopted in bad faith.

455 See Italian Constitutional Court’s Decision No. 238/2009 (Exhibit REX-13), {[ 7.2.1.
456 Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award
(18 July 2014) (Exhibit CL-162RM), 1404: “In Chapter VIHILB, the Tribunal concluded, on the totality of the
evidence, that the tax authorities used the “re-attribution” formula not only so as to be able to collect the revenue-
based taxes against Yukos, but also so as to establish a basis for imposing on Yukos the massive VAT liability and
excessive fines that followed. In the Tribunal’s view, while Yukos was vulnerable on some aspects of its tax
optimization scheme, principally because of the sham-like nature of certain elements of its operations in at least some
of the low-tax regions, and could have faced some legitimate claims relating to revenue-based taxes had the Russian
Federation limited itself to bona fide taxation measures, the State decided to take of that
Li bility; it did so by l ing a full assault on Yukos and its ficial owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and
appropriate its assets while, at the same time, removing Mr. Khodorkovsky from the political arena. The Tribunal has
come to these conclusions based on its review of the entire record, as detailed in the other chapters of Part VIII,
above.” (emphasis added)

144

[...] Jt is probable that this taxation measure does not have its intended
effect in favour of the environment and that its adoption had no other
purpose than to reduce the tariff deficit [...] Yet, the Arbitral Tribunal
does not need to decide this because if the true purpose of the measure
were merely to raise funds [...] it would nevertheless coincide with the
legitimate purpose of any taxation measure incapable of qualifying it as
a bad faith measure. Even if it were right that the State has presented
a measure to merely raise funds as being in favour of the environment,
the conclusion would be the same. It is the real purpose of the measure
that has to be considered by the Tribunal rather than its presentation
that may be justified by political reasons {...].°7

378. Belenergia has not satisfied its burden of proving that imbalance costs are a mala fide
taxation measure, used as part of a pattern of behaviour aimed at partially or completely
destroying its investment.

379. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over Belenergia’s

imbalance costs claim, based on Article 21 ECT.

VI. THE MERITS

de que las medidas impositivas promulgadas por un Estado son bona fide. Como lo subrayé el Tribunal en el caso
RosInvestCo, ‘States have a wide latitude in imposing and enforcing taxation law, even if resulting in substantial
deprivation without compensation.’ Los casos Yukos y RoslnvestCo contrastan medidas bona fide con medidas
adoptadas para destruir a una parte o a un adversario politico. Las criticas del IVPEE formuladas por la
Demandante no revelan un propésito tan extremo. Las repercusiones econémicas o los efectos del IVPEE pueden
resultar oscuros y discutibles, pero eso no constituye un argumento suficiente para concluir que el IVPEE es una
medida impositiva promulgada de mala fe. 740. Es probable que dicha medida impositiva no tenga el pretendido
efecto a favor del medioambiente y que su promulgacién no tenia otro propésito mas que el de disminuir el déficit
tarifario, segtin lo afirma la Demandante. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Arbitral no necesita pronunciarse al respecto,
puesto que, si la verdadera finalidad de la medida hubiera sido meramente recaudaria, de acuerdo con la
argumentaci6n desarrollada por la Demandante, coincidiria con la finalidad legitima de todo impuesto sin que se
pueda caracterizar la mala fe de esta medida impositiva. Si fuera cierto que el Estado present6 una medida
meramente recaudaria como medida favorable al medioambiente, la conclusién seria la misma. Es la finalidad real
de la medida que tiene que ser valorada por el Tribunal y no su presentacién cosmética que puede explicarse por
motivos politicos que no caben dentro del andlisis del Tribunal Arbitral.” See also Eiser Infrastructure Limited and

arbitration through the written and oral submissions of the Parties. The fact that a particular
submission is not expressly referenced below should not be taken as any indication that it

has not been considered by the Tribunal.

As the Tribunal decided above that it lacks jurisdiction over Belenergia’s imbalance costs
claim, the Parties’ arguments on the merits relating to such costs are not reproduced

thereafter.
A. The Claimant’s Position

. The Claimant argues that Italy has breached Article 10(1) ECT, which provides for “distinct
but mutually reinforcing obligations,” including the FET and the most constant protection
and security obligations (“FPS”), the prohibition of unreasonable or discriminatory
measures, and the umbrella clause.*>* According to the Claimant, these distinct obligations
should be interpreted in the light of the “effet utile” principle.’ The Claimant further relies
on Article 10(2) and Article 10(3) ECT, arguing that Italy has also breached its obligation

not to discriminate under these provisions.

(1) Italy Has Breached the FET Standard under Article 10(1) ECT
(a) The applicable FET standard
. The Claimant states that the FET standard under Article 10(1) ECT is an objective,
autonomous, self-contained standard.*° The FET standard must not fall below the minimum
treatment standard under international law.*°' In the Claimant’s view, “international law”

corresponds to “treaty obligations by which Italy is bound and any rules of general

international law.*°? The Claimant adds that the FET standard is not restricted by the

minimum standard under customary international law.4%

384. Belenergia argues that the FET standard under Article 10(1) ECT should be interpreted in
accordance with Articles 31 and 32 VCLT, including the ordinary meaning of its terms, in
their context, in the light of the ECT’s object and purpose.** The Claimant refers to the text
of Article 10(1) ECT providing that Contracting Parties “encourage and create stable,
equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting
Parties.”*® It also refers*® to Article 2 ECT on the “Purpose of the Treaty,” which states

that:

[The ECT] establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term
cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual
benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the
Charter 4°"

385. Then it refers*** to an excerpt from the 1991 European Energy Charter (a precursor document

to the ECT) providing that:

In order to promote the international flow of investments, the
signatories will at national level provide for a stable, transparent legal
framework for foreign investments, in conformity with the relevant
international laws and rules on investment and trade.“

386. Belenergia highlights the text of Article 10(1) ECT that Contracting Parties commit “to
accord at all times” FET, referring to Blusun v. Italy.4”° The Claimant endorses a “tripartite”
application of the FET standard to host State’s conduct that (a) violates the investor’s

legitimate expectations; (b) is procedurally improper; and (c) is substantively improper.*7!

387. First, Belenergia argues that several arbitral tribunals have considered that the protection of
investors’ “legitimate expectations” is a “dominant element” of the FET standard,*” to be
assessed when the investment was made.*’? The Claimant defines “legitimate expectations”
with a citation from Murphy v. Ecuador that “legitimate expectations are based upon an
objective understanding of the legal framework within which the investor has made its

investment,” requiring:

(a) a legal framework including the host State’s international law obligations,
domestic legislations, regulations and contracts concluded with the

investor;

(b) general representations by the host State creating legitimate expectations by

the investor; and

(c) (although not strictly necessary) specific representations or undertakings

by the host State creating legitimate expectations by the investor.**

388. In this respect, the Claimant adds that good faith is as an international law principle relevant
for a FET finding, meaning that “a State cannot blow hot and cold” and that the parties
should “deal honestly and fairly with each other.”*7> The Claimant therefore rejects Italy’s
modulation of the FET standard in the light of “sovereign” regulatory prerogatives.*” In its
view, “sovereign prerogatives have a role to play but only in the content of assessing whether

the FET standard [protects] an investor’s legitimate expectations.”*””

389. In Belenergia’s view, the Tribunal should consider two aspects of legitimate expectations:
(a) the investor’s general expectation of regulatory and business stability; and (b) the

investor’s reasonable reliance on specific commitments by the host State.”® The Claimant

argues that a breach of either of these aspects of legitimate expectations leads to a FET
breach.4” It highlights the importance of Belenergia’s reliance on specific commitments in

this arbitration, citing various arbitral decisions.*®°

The Claimant also distinguishes this arbitration from recent PV investment treaty arbitrations
(Charanne v. Spain, Blusun v. Italy, Isolux v. Spain and Eiser v. Spain). It explains that in
none of these arbitrations claimants have demonstrated specific commitments by the host
State; rather, in these arbitrations claimants have relied on the general stability of the host
State’s regulatory framework.**' Belenergia submits, however, that the tribunal in
Eiser v. Spain found in favour of Eiser holding that “regulatory regimes cannot be radically
altered” on the basis of the investor’s general expectation of regulatory and business
stability.

The Claimant also cites Micula v. Romania,*®*

noting that even if the investor’s umbrella
claim did not succeed because it did not establish a breach of a legal obligation under
Romanian law, the Romanian legislative framework’s stabilisation component could have

given rise to a FET breach.**?

Second, Belenergia further submits that procedurally improper conduct by the host State also
breaches the FET standard. In its view, a procedurally improper conduct is conduct that
(a) violates transparency and consistency rules; (b) violates due process; or (c) fails to

negotiate with the investor or does so in bad faith.4*4

Third, substantive impropriety meaning arbitrary, unreasonably, discriminatory, bad-faith
conduct also breaches the FET standard.**> According to the Claimant, the pursuit of a

rational policy sometimes does not pass the proportionality test, leading to an FET breach.**°

(b) Breach of legitimate expectations

termination or amendment.*”°

395. Belenergia submits that it has relied on these regulatory and contractual commitments

providing for PV incentives. It has therefore made its investment with the legitimate
expectation that the feed-in tariffs and the minimum prices had become acquired rights and

thus could not be modified in relation to existing PV plants.*”°

396. The context of these PV incentives caused Belenergia’s legitimate expectations that these

incentives would remain in place. According to the Expert Report by Professor Carlo Andrea

Bollino*®” (

“Prof. Bollino’s Report”), Italy’s previous PV incentives did not lead to
significant PV investment. Prof. Bollino’s Report and Professor Alessandro Marangoni in
its Expert Report*** (“Prof. Marangoni’s Report”) concur that the cost of capital of PV
energy production was very high, Italy needed to set up generous incentives to encourage
PV investment.*”? Therefore, Italy devised incentives granted to private operators that
connected their PV plants to the national grid, in addition to “the usual market set electricity

price, a significant fixed subsidy over the expected life span of the plants, being 20 years.”°

Feed-in tariffs

397. According to Belenergia, Legislative Decree 387/2003 set out the incentives’ features,

including (a) the scheme’s funding by final electricity consumers; (b) subsidies as a premium
in addition to PV electricity’s market price; (c)PV investment’s fair remuneration;
(d) subsidies’ decrease proportionate to technology costs’ reduction, different subsidies
applying to PV plants with different aggregate level capacity (in Mw); (e) subsidies’ duration
for the PV plants’ life, that is, 20 years; (f) subsidies’ amount constant during the PV plants’

submits that Italy granted these PV incentives through the following Energy Accounts:

5° and

(a) Energy Account I: Ministerial Decrees adopted on 28 July 200:
6 February 2006 establishing feed-in tariffs for an equitable recovery of
investment and operating costs by PV energy producers, capped at an
overall maximum PV energy production of 500 MW (with annual caps).
The 20-year feed-in tariffs—Article 2(1)(1)—were crystallised in the
Conventions concluded between the PV plant owners and the GSE,

authorising assignment of credits to third parties such as banks.>°>

(b) Energy Account II: Ministerial Decree adopted on 19 February 20079
establishing a “balance approach” encouraging PV plant’s efficiency, not
affecting acquired rights under Energy Account I—Article 16, and
confirming the 20-year feed-in tariffs—Article 2(1)(h). It established a new
threshold of 1200 MW without annual caps.*”°

(c) Energy Account III: Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010, establishing a

progressive reduction of feed-in tariffs, not affecting rights under previous

507

Energy Accounts—Article 1(3 Application of this decree was

postponed until 30 June 2011 due to PV plant owners’ criticism against

unclear application of Energy Account II.>°

of the feed-in tariffs when annual costs reached € 6 billion.

(e) Energy Account V: Ministerial Decree of 5 July 2012, *!° adopted when
annual costs with feed-in tariffs approached € 6 billion. It established an
“all-inclusive tariff’? (“tariffa_ omnicomprensiva”) to plants meeting
additional technical requirements, applicable to PV plants entering in
operation after 27 August 2012. It did not affect acquired rights under the

previous Energy Accounts—Article 20(1).>!!

398. The relevant Energy Accounts I to V,>!? adopted through Ministerial Decrees, built on these
incentives’ features, ensuring stability of the system: PV plants achieving a higher aggregate
level capacity—as technology advanced and became cheaper—had to move to a different
Energy Account with lesser subsidies.*'* The GSE Conventions concluded under the Energy
Accounts provided for an acquired right to 20-year feed-in tariffs, that is a long-term
incentives guarantee under a private contract, helping increase the Italian PV sector and
easing security assignments of these 20-year receivables with banks.*!*+ Belenergia adduces
that Italian legislation’s ““grandfathering” is undeniable because when a new tariff came in
under a new Energy Account, “prior [feed-in tariffs] Conventions were ‘grandfathered’”

thereby retaining tariffs granted under the GSE Conventions despite ongoing reduction in

tariffs for future solar plants.*!°

Yet the Claimant explains that these regulatory and specific contractual commitments were
abandoned with, among other regulatory acts, the Spalma Incentivi Decree*!® of

24 June 2014 later confirmed by Conversion Law No. 116/2014 of 11 August 2014.5!

The Spalma Incentivi Decree reduced feed-in tariffs applying to all PV plants with a nominal
power above 200 Kw, irrespective of GSE Conventions already in force. *!* All three options
offered to PV plant owners under this Decree were disadvantageous, as confirmed by Italian
courts.>!? In Belenergia’s view, these three options affected the PV system’s stability failing

520

to provide them with proper remuneration through feed-in tariffs,’~’ the three options being

the following:

(a) the “spread incentives option” extending the duration of incentives from 20

to 24 years but reducing incentives proportionally to the PV plant’s lifetime;

(b) the “butterfly option” keeping the 20-year duration but varying the quantum

of incentives throughout time; and

(c) the “outright cut option” reducing 6% to 8% of incentives altogether

proportionally to the PV plant’s nominal capacity.>?!

Belenergia’s SPVs were deemed to have opted for the “outright cut option,” automatically

applying in the event of failure to expressly make an option.>”?

Belenergia argues that Article 26 of Conversion Law No. 116/2014 also changed the
payment modality of feed-in tariffs: rather than monthly payments at 100% of estimated
annual electricity production, Article 26 provided for monthly payments at 90% with

payment of the final 10% balance by 30 June of next year.°*? Belenergia submits that the

two mitigation schemes under Article 26 of Conversion Law No. 116/2014 were never

403. The Claimant alleges that the GSE Conventions replicated the GSE’s standard terms and
conditions, forbade their unilateral termination or amendment and did not provide for force
majeure or hardship exceptions.°*> Belenergia refers to the First Opinion of Professors Onida

and Randazzo°°

that the Spalma Incentivi Decree “partially revoked, unilaterally and
authoritatively” the GSE Conventions’ commitments in relation to the Claimant’s PV

subsidiaries.*?”

404. The Claimant concludes that the Spalma Incentivi Decree breached the pacta sunt servanda
principle in relation to contractual and international obligations undertaken by Italy. It adds
that doubts about the interpretation of the GSE Conventions should be interpreted in favour

of the Claimant (contra proferentem rule).>7*

Belenergia differs with Italy that feed-in tariffs were unsustainable or that Italy could not
afford them because Italy was not funding them.*? On the contrary, the incentives resulted
in higher PV capacity and thus lower prices to consumers, with benefits to the Italian
economy estimated at € 1.8 billion in 2013.°*° The Claimant also disagrees with Italy that
the reduction in feed-in tariffs could enhance competitiveness favouring small and medium-

sized enterprises (“SMEs”); rather, the SMEs’ cost savings were “negligible and irrelevant

531

for a real improvement of the SME’s competitiveness, and “about 4 million small scale

business users of electricity have not benefited from the reduction.”***

to sell 80% of electricity by the recognised feed-in tariff to primary European financial operators. In turn, the second
scheme under Article 26 provided for access to loans guaranteed by Italy’s Cassa Depositi e Presitti (“CDP”).

Moreover, Belenergia rejects Italy’s additional reasons, being PV investments’ low risk,
Italy’s solar irradiation underestimation and PV technology’s efficiency. The Claimant
argues that these reasons were not raised at the time Italy adopted the challenged measures.***
The Claimant submits that PV investors bear all risks associated with production, including
quality risk in relation to design, components, construction, national grid, solar irradiation
risks, and regulatory risks.°*+ Belenergia submits that Italy did not challenge the conclusions
on risks of its experts Professor Marangoni (Althesys), and Eng. Sarraceno and Eng.
Guerrieri (Protos’ Report), noting that GRIF accepted at the Hearing that the factors listed in

the Protos’ Report incur risk.°*°

Moreover, the Claimant asserts that data on better solar irradiation levels had existed since
2010; it had long been established that 80% was a more appropriate PV efficiency factor than
75%.°*© The Claimant submits that it has shown during the Hearing that Italy’s justification
for the incentives reduction is not supported by the use of less accurate data (Photovoltaic
Geographical Information System’s (“PVGIS”) data vs. more accurate PVSYST data) when
granting incentives. Among other things, the Claimant argues that it has shown that it has
never used PVGIS data but used PVSYST when estimating with accuracy its plants’
production data and that Italy provided very little evidence that it relied on PVGIS data when

granting incentives.**”

Belenergia further states that Italian courts have recognised the general principles of
“consolidated substantial situations” (“situazioni sostanziali”) and acquired rights (“diritti

acquisiti”).°® The High Administrative Court has also recognised that private parties had

legitimate expectations that the State must not unilaterally modify the legal regime applying

to the GSE Conventions.>°

409. The Claimant also argues that it relied on legitimate expectations created by Italy when
financing and making the investment. Firstly, the Claimant relied on due diligence reports
by “prominent Italian legal and accountancy firms and banks.”**° These reports made “no
record of any previous case of unilateral modification of [GSE] Conventions.”**! Secondly,
Belenergia also relied on the “financial sustainability” of Italy’s PV incentives scheme and
on the “financial capability of the GSE.” *” Thirdly, the Claimant relied on the GSE
Convention’s income stream allowing credit assignment as collateral for bank loans.*4*

Belenergia refers to its CEO Mr. Eduard Levy’s First Witness Statement stating that:

“It was an incredible surprise for us to incur the above-mentioned
changes of laws because we had already executed surface contracts
with the owners of the lands where the plants were located and specific
terms had been agreed, as well as contracts with the banks to receive
their loans on the basis of specific conditions and assumptions that had
been negotiated in advance. We had also assigned our GSE credits to
the banks in order to guarantee our loans. Furthermore we had already
executed the Operation and Maintenance agreements with our
contractors to maintain the plants under specific terms and conditions,
as well as insurance policies, security agreements to protect the plants
etc. [...] If we had known in advance that such fundamental economic
terms underlying the Conventions [...] were going to change for the
worse, we would have never realized such investment. ’>“+

410. The Claimant states that the Respondent misconstrues its legitimate expectation argument:
Claimant’s case is not that it could not have expected that Italy’s PV regulatory framework

would change; rather, its case is that it could not have expected the changes affecting its

acquired rights.*4>

Noting Italy’s refusal to consider the GSE Conventions as private contracts,>*° Belenergia
submits that even if this were not the case—quod non—the GSE Conventions are specific
commitments by the host State.**” In the Claimant’s view, the wording of GSE Conventions
on feed-in tariffs’ duration and quantum makes these specific commitments a stabilisation

clause.*48

Belenergia distinguishes the present case from Blusun v. Italy, among other reasons, because
(a) in Blusun the investor had not received a GSE letter confirming the incentive let alone
entered into GSE Conventions; and (b) the challenged Romani Decree in Blusun did not
affect investors with acquired rights“? The JSWv. Czech Republic case is also
distinguishable from the present case because no specific commitment let alone a contract
existed. Further, Belenergia analyses the findings in Eiser, Novenergia, Isolux, Charanne
and Masdar decisions, as follows:

What the cases (except Masdar) say is that if an investor makes an

investment where there is no specific commitment to a rate, then small

changes (which were envisaged by documents issued by the State prior
to investment) may not give rise to a claim (Charanne) [...]

[I]nvesting in the knowledge that producers’ entitlements to an incentive
have been changed in certain respects, and may be liable to change
according to Court decisions [...] makes it difficult to say that there is
a legitimate expectation that rates will not change (Isolux) [...]

 

[A] complete change in approach to tariffs can give rise to a claim,
certainly if that change entirely destroys the investment (Eiser), but even
if that change does not make a plant uneconomic (Novenergia). Now,
with Masdar, we have a Tribunal emphasising that the consideration of
the nature of the change has little relevance in the context of legitimate
expectations derived from specific commitments.

Belenergia then concludes that these prepositions are not detrimental to its case:

First, as has been stated, save for Masdar, they do not involve specific
commitments. It is submitted that the Claimant’s case on specific

commitment is even stronger than in the Masdar case, given that the
Claimant holds a contractual commitment. Second, the regulatory
regime in Spain was subject to a stream of changes and case law which,
depending on the timing of the claims, affected the legitimate
expectations of the investors. These factors feature heavily in the cases
where the investors have lost. These factors are not present in our case
and in fact stability in Italy is emphasised by the fact that the producers
were grandfathered and unaffected by changes in law. Third, the
principle that legitimate expectations can be derived from an objective
understanding of the legislation is supported. Fourth, read properly,
they do not establish a proposition that a very large impact on an
investment is required to bring a claim**?

Belenergia concludes that the Spalma Incentivi Decree undermined the “perfectly

2 553

reasonable expectation relied on by Belenergia that the GSE Conventions on feed-in

tariffs “would be respected and producers holding such rights would be grandfathered,

irrespective of future reductions in incentives.”***

Minimum prices

Moreover, the Claimant states that Italy adopted additional PV incentives through a
mandatory purchase regime (“ritiro dedicato”) based on minimum prices (“prezzi minimi
garantiti”) under AEEG Resolutions No. 34/2005 and 280/2007. This mandatory purchase
regime enabled PV plant owners to sell electricity directly to the GSE under simplified terms
and conditions, as an alternative to selling on the wholesale market or to selling through

555

power purchase agreements with consumers. This regime was crystallised in the GSE

Conventions on minimum prices, concluded between the GSE and PV plant owners.*°°

The Claimant cites Article 13°°’ of GSE Conventions on minimum prices, noting that these
Conventions automatically renewed yearly. Claimant also submits that Article 13 granted
the PV producer the option to terminate without cause, not the GSE, and that the prices are

determined by reference to AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007. According to this Resolution,

the AEEG was to fix the price annually, the default position being prices fixed by reference
to an inflation measure.*°*® This was consistent with AEEG Resolution No. 34/2005, which
led to “an established approach over 8 years.”°° Among other things, the Claimant refers
to the minimum price updates of AEEG in relation to years 2008 to 2011 that gave “no idea

79560

about a change to come, which was confirmed by Mr. Lévy.*°

417. Nevertheless, AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013 cut minimum prices to € 38.5/MWh for the
calendar year 2014, that is, a 50% cut. Four days later, Article 1(2) of Destination Italia
Decree®” of 23 December 2013, later confirmed by Conversion Law No. 9/2013 of
21 February 2014, repealed the fixed minimum price applying to Belenergia’s PV plants
benefiting from feed-in tariffs.°°? Under Article 1(2) of the Destinazione Italia Decree the
minimum guaranteed price for PV plants with incentives was fixed as equal to the applicably
hourly zonal price, except for PV plants with capacity up to 100Kw.>™

418. The Claimant explains that the Respondent agrees that minimum prices sought to cover

565

operating costs* and that this was aimed at attracting investors.* According to the

Claimant, Italy has failed to show that operating costs dropped; hence Italy’s justification to

cut minimum prices is unwarranted.*”

419. By repealing the minimum price regime Italy breached the FET provision in view of
Belenergia’s legitimate expectation that the minimum prices “would continue to cover OPEX
costs and would not be suddenly and radically changed.”** The Claimant clarifies that these
repealing measures applied to PV plants under the Energy Accounts I to IV.* Belenergia

also clarifies that AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013 of 19 December 2013 had already

operating and fuel costs).>”°

According to Belenergia, legitimate expectations in relation to minimum prices are not
founded on specific assurances but on Belenergia’s objective understanding of Italian

legislation, as follows:

(a) Italian legislation on fixed minimum price “was designed to cover operating costs
and protect investors from fluctuation in the market price and therefore attract

investors;”
(b) Italy’s practice to maintain stable prices from 2005 to the end of 2013;

(c) The minimum price commitment under the GSE Conventions was “automatically
renewable and not revocable at will by the State, albeit this then did refer back to the

commitment to pay prices pursuant to AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007;” and

(d) Italy has failed to show facts justifying the radical cut and later removal of fixed

minimum prices.°”!

(c) Procedural impropriety

requiring a two-phase consultation, including a Regulatory Impact Analysis (“RIA”) and a

Technical Regulatory Analysis (“TRA”).

increase small and medium enterprises’ (“SME”) competitiveness; (b) unjustifiable in
relation to Italy’s unproven claim on GSE Conventions’ unsustainability; (c) discriminatory

view, an umbrella clause should be interpreted pursuant to its own terms, which should be

given their ordinary meaning pursuant to the VCLT, in the light of the effet utile principle.**?

Belenergia also submits that Italy has failed to opt out from the umbrella clause under
Article 10(1) ECT, although it had this option under Article 26(3)(c) ECT.’ So, Italy

591

“unconditionally consent[ed]” to the umbrella clause. The Claimant describes the

umbrella clause’s effects as follows:

[T]he effect of umbrella clauses is to stabilise investor-State relations

ex post by offering an enforcement mechanism for investment-related

host State promises, entirely independent of whether the breach that

gives rise to liability under the clause is of sovereign or a purely

commercial nature.>*
Moreover, Belenergia asserts that violation of contractual obligations by a Contracting Party
leads to violation of the umbrella clause’s treaty obligation to comply with contractual
commitments; in other words, the umbrella clause “internationalises” contractual
breaches.°”? This is the interpretation adopted, for example, in Noble Ventures v. Romania,
the umbrella clause under the US-Romania BIT having a broad, “almost identical” wording

to the umbrella clause under Article 10(1) ECT.°*

(b) The nature of GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs

The Claimant stresses that Italy does not dispute that the GSE Conventions on the feed-in
tariffs are contracts under Italian law; rather Italy argues that they are not “private” contracts,
but “accessory”, public law contracts. The Claimant argues that they are “private” contracts,
breached by Italy and that Italy is estopped from denying their “private”, “contractual”

character.**> According to Claimant, Italy is estopped from denying this because

(i) Legislative Decree No. 28/2011 expressly stated that GSE Conventions are private
contracts; (ii) Italy drafted and marketed the GSE Conventions as private contracts with a

20-year duration guarantee; (iii) Belenergia relied in good faith on all these unconditional,

express and implied representations by Italy.>°°

432. The Claimant disagrees with Italy that the GSE Conventions “simply reflect whatever the
legislation says from time to time.”°’ The Claimant cites Professor Onida saying that a
private law contract can be accessory to an administrative act but this does not mean that it

simply reflects legislation let alone that the State could freely modify it:°*

PROF ONIDA: If we are saying that these contracts are linked to a
procedure that up to that point is realised through unilateral acts then
this is true, because these contracts could not come into being without
the existence of the law, the ministerial decree of Conto Energia, the
investigation of the GSE, the letter of the GSE recognising the tariffs
and so we sign the Conventions. This is true. It is a contract that is
accessory to a procedure, but we cannot say this contract does not have
the same effect as a contract of private law, this is not true, because
otherwise it would be fully pointless to sign this contract, the
administrative act would be sufficient. We would only need the
administrative act to grant the incentive. But the fact that the content of
these provisions is then transposed into a private law contract means,
in our opinion, that the intention was to give a different effect to the
commitment. Normally when the States make commitments in its role
as regulator, they are limited by reasonableness and so on and so forth,
but when the State makes commitments in its role as a party to a contract
it does not do so and assumes a specific commitment as a contracting
party vis-a-vis the private investor. Where there is no contract, such
specific undertaking is not given. Here we have this specific
commitment.

[...] PROF ONIDA: We have to establish what we mean by accessory
contract. If it's a public law contract, it's only regulated by public law.
Here the specification of a contract of private law, it must necessarily
have consequences. Otherwise, it would be illogical”

3. The Claimant submits that the evidence, including Professor Onida’s statements at the
Hearing, established that “the [GSE] Conventions operate as binding contractual
commitments as to the incentive rate contained within the Conventions, for their entire 20
year duration, which are distinct from the legislative and administrative acts preceding

them.”

4. The Claimant further disagrees with Italy’s argument on the basis of the Corte di
Cassazione’s Decision No. 10795/2017.! According to the Claimant, the United Chambers
of the court ruled on the conflict of jurisdiction in favour of administrative courts’
jurisdiction on the basis of Article 41 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure, not on the merits
of the case that is subject to the exclusive competence of administrative courts. Hence, Italy
cannot rely on this Decision to argue that the GSE Conventions are “accessory” or “hybrid”

contracts.©

an

. If the Tribunal agrees that the GSE Conventions qualify as binding contracts, “it inexorably
follows that the umbrella clause is applicable.”©* The Claimant submits that the Respondent
accepted in the Rejoinder that the umbrella clause applies to purely contractual claims when
the State acts as a commercial entity.“ The contractual nature of the GSE Conventions is
“a clear point of distinction from all the solar cases (hence the absence of any real attention

437. Accepting that private contracts like the GSE Conventions may be “instruments of

regulation” to the extent that they result from legislation, the Claimant argues that Italy
misinterprets Decision No. 16/2017 of the Constitutional Court.%® According to the
Claimant, the Italian courts have not ruled on the question of breach of contract, that is,
whether the GSE breached the GSE Conventions; rather, the Constitutional Court ruled in
Decision No. 16/2017 that the Spalma Incentivi Decree was consistent with certain

provisions of the Italian Constitution. The Claimant cites two Italian cases which

610

identified the GSE Conventions as private contracts;°!° relying on Professor Onida’s oral

evidence:

PROF ONIDA: Well, the breach of a contract is simply conduct not
provided for by the contract, while the modification of the regulatory
framework is an amendment within the limits that the legislator may
operate within, so it is a matter of discussing the limits in this case. It is
a different thing.

MR AIELLO: If there is such a difference why do you say in your first
statement on page 6 that the GSE is a breaching party in relation to the
executed contract?

PROF ONIDA: Because, according to the contract, changing the
content without the agreement of the other party is a breach of the
contract, even if, from the GSE standpoint, it is something that stems
from a regulatory intervention.®"!

Conventions served no purpose and did not create any contractual right “defies common

sense,” and that preference should be given to Professor Onida’s explanations.

439. Moreover, Belenergia argues that Italy has failed to prove how Article 1139 of the

Italian Civil Code could assist Italy’s right to cut incentives if the GSE Conventions qualify

as private contracts.°!4

Belenergia adds that Italy has failed to show that the Italian
Constitutional Court has a longstanding practice to accept that the State can change the law
as it did affecting the GSE Conventions, citing Professor Onida’ view that Decision 16/2017

was a “turning point.”6!

440. Belenergia also argues that—irrespective of GSE Conventions’ “private”, “accessory” or
“contractual” character—these Conventions contain specific commitments by Italy that have
been breached.°'® Belenergia relies on arbitral decisions and scholarly writings supporting
that the ECT’s broadly worded umbrella clause concerns:

[...] all investment-related promises of the host State that are either
contractual in nature, constitute a functional substitute to a contractual

commitment or are otherwise binding obligations, irrespective of
whether that commitment is in the form of a unilateral undertaking.°!”

[And that] there is no reason to restrict the umbrella clause in the ECT
to contractual obligations, still less a particular type of contractual

441. In the Claimant’s view, the GSE, the party signatory to the GSE Conventions concluded with
Belenergia’s PV subsidiaries, acts as an “emanation” of Italy, which, in turn, enacted

the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.

442. Belenergia then refers to Articles 4(1) and 8(1)! of GSE’s bylaws, stating that the GSE
performs activities of “public nature” in the electricity sector (“funzioni di natura
pubblicistica del settore elettrico”) and that its shareholders are the Ministry of Economy
and Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development.®? The Claimant adds that Italian
courts have confirmed that the GSE is equal to the Italian public administration.* Thus, the
Claimant states that the Spalma Incentivi Decree and the Conversion Law No. 116/2014

repudiated the feed-in tariff regime and the respective GSE Conventions, being “directly

attributable to the Respondent in its capacity as a sovereign.”°*

443. The Claimant objects to the Respondent’s argument that Italy could not have breached the
GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs through the Spalma Incentivi Decree and the Conversion
Law No. 116/2014. The Claimant disagrees that an umbrella clause violation covers only an
“autonomous act’ by the GSE because this argument deprives the umbrella clause of
effects.©> In its view, Italy cannot rely on domestic law to evade international responsibility,

relying on Sempra v. Argentina.°° Italy cannot rely on Italian law to deny the

“internationalisation” of these breaches.°””

444. Belenergia differs with Italy that the Spalma Incentivi Decree and the Conversion Law

No. 116/2014 affecting the entire Italian PV sector could exempt Italy from the umbrella

clause violation.®* It also differs that the Tribunal’s findings on the FET standard affect the

umbrella clause, an independent standard under Article 10(1) ECT.?

According to the Claimant, Italy or its agency has entered into contracts with specific
undertakings towards Belenergia establishing the umbrella clause claim. Belenergia
therefore submits that Italy has violated the umbrella clause under Article 10(1) ECT with
“the adoption of legislative and regulatory acts [...] unilaterally modif[ying]” the GSE

Conventions on the feed-in tariffs.°°°

Nevertheless, “[i]f the umbrella clause case fails for some reason, these undertakings ought,
in the absence of very powerful countervailing factors, to establish the FET claim in this

case”®! above.

(3) Italy Has Breached the Prohibition against Unreasonable and Discriminatory
Measures under Article 10(1) ECT
Belenergia argues that the prohibition of unreasonable and discriminatory measures is an
independent protection standard under Article 10(1) ECT.*” Belenergia objects to Italy’s
interpretation of this standard as overlapping with the FET standard.°? Rather, Belenergia
argues that several arbitral tribunals confirmed that the prohibition of unreasonable and

discriminatory measures is independent from the FET standard.°**

According to Belenergia, the “reasonableness” of a measure implies a “rational policy”
addressing public interest goals, and a reasonably designed and reasonably applied measure,

in light of the particular circumstances.*° Belenergia also states that “reasonableness” of a

measure requires proportionality and a “reasonable relationship to some rational policy,”

subject to a host State’s investigation of less harmful, alternative measures.°*°

Belenergia submits that the non-discriminatory character of a measure is entirely
independent, extending beyond a FET analysis—contrary to Italy’s position.’ The
Claimant refers to Electrabel v. Hungary’s broad approach to discrimination as “any lesser

treatment” irrespective of discriminatory intent.°*

The Claimant submits that Italy’s measures affecting feed-in tariffs and minimum prices

were unreasonable and discriminatory breaching Article 10(1) ECT.

First, Belenergia argues that Italy has failed to carry out an investigation of the measures’
impact and of less harmful, alternative measures because only one month elapsed between

the measures’ announcement and their adoption.*?

Second, Italy’s regulatory changes were unpredictable, not balanced by adequate mitigating
or compensatory measures.™? Italy’s offering mitigation measures to foreign investors
means an acceptance that the Splama Incentivi Decree was “unduly harmful.” According to
Belenergia, mitigation measures were unreasonable, as confirmed by Professor Marangoni

ithesys) ans r. Lévy and not challenge tal at the earing; in addition, these
(Althesys) and Mr. Lévy and not challenged by Italy at the Hearing;“*! in addition, th

measures were never implemented.”

Third, and alternatively, Belenergia claims that Italy’s measures are disproportionate,
lacking public interest goals such as environment or public health protection, and a “rational
policy”. As for feed-in tariffs, Italy’s measures lack public interest goals, when favouring
specific, limited electricity consumers of medium and low electric voltage, with available

power higher than 16.5Kw, excluding residential consumers and public lighting.“ In

relation to minimum prices, Belenergia argues that Italy’s measures also lack public interest

goals because their sole motivation is containing electricity prices.

The Claimant highlights Professor Marangoni’s (Althesys) conclusion that the
Spalma Incentivi Decree did not achieve the goal of “enhancing competitiveness” of SMEs,
noting that Italy has failed to challenge this at the Hearing.° According to the Claimant,
Italy did not challenge either the conclusions of Professor Marangoni in the Althesys Report
that the reduction of incentives (a) did not benefit other citizens or entities because the A3
cost component in consumer electricity bills increased again in 2014 and 4 million small
scale business users of electricity did not benefit from the reduction; and (b) did not take into
account PV benefits, such as the decrease in prices to consumers in 2011-2016 with a
cumulative impact of € 4.7 billion and the € 1.8 billion benefit to the Italian economy in

2013.7

Fourth, the Claimant submits that the Spalma Incentivi Decree discriminated against foreign
investors. De facto discrimination suffices, proof of discriminatory intent being

unnecessary.©®

The Claimant concludes that Italy has failed to challenge Claimant’s
evidence on discrimination in its Rejoinder and at the Hearing, which, in the Claimant’s
view, is revealing.™? Among other things, the Claimant asserted that Italy’s “late” argument
on a purported discrimination against Italian investors founded on a future ECT award

favouring foreign investors should be rejected.°°

(4) Italy Has Breached the Most Constant Protection and Security Obligation under

Respondent that FPS is limited to “preventing and protecting aliens from violence and

harassment.”°

457. Moreover, Belenergia explains that this obligation comprises “full protection and security”
as a guarantee of stability, physical, commercial and legal security, and legal protection.°*
It refers to various commentators supporting its position that Article 10(1) ECT protects not
only physical integrity, but also economic and legal security.°* The Claimant also advocates

that “investment case law is also heavily” in its favour.

458. The Claimant rejects Italy’s argument that the FPS standard overlaps with the FET standard,
stating that Italy overlooks the effet utile principle of treaty interpretation.*° Among others,
Belenergia refers to the Electrabel v. Hungary award holding that the FET and the FPS

standard under the ECT are distinct.°°7

459. Belenergia highlights the same reasons for the FET breach leading to violation of the FPS
standard under Article 10(1) ECT.®* It submits that Italy has substantially changed the
applicable legal framework irrespective of GSE Conventions’ rights harming Belenergia’s

(5) Italy Has Breached the Prohibition of Discrimination under Articles 10(2) and
10(3) ECT
460. Belenergia asserts that the combined reading of Articles 10(2) and 10(3) ECT prohibits legal
and de facto discrimination against foreign investors in relation to Italian nationals. The
Claimant also rejects Italy’s argument that application of Articles 10(2) and 10(3) ECT on

661

national treatment is limited to the initial making of investments. Rather, Belenergia

argues that the text of these provisions does not freeze their application within time.

461. The Claimant differs with Italy that WTO case law on national treatment is relevant for this
arbitration.©™ It also rejects Italy’s argument that Belenergia’s PV plants are not comparable
to Italian public entities and schools (“enti locali o scuole”); it highlights that “in like
situations” under the ECT “cannot be interpreted in the narrow sense [because] the purpose
of national treatment is to protect investors as compared to local producers, and this cannot
be done by addressing exclusively the sector in which the particular activity is undertaken”
(citing Occidental v. Ecuador).®* It also refers to Nycomb v. Latvia, supporting that when
entities are “comparable, and subject to the same laws and regulations,” respondent bears

the burden of proof that discrimination has not taken place.®™

462. First, the Claimant points out that Article 22bis of Law No. 164/2014°° excludes from the

4996 «4,

application of Article 26 of Conversion Law No. 116/201 certain Italian public entities

and schools” (“enti locali o scuole”). In its view, Article 22bis discriminates against
Belenergia’s PV subsidiaries because certain Italian public entities are Belenergia’s

competitors.°7

463. Second, the regulatory changes do not apply to PV plant owners with a plant nominal

capacity less than 200Kw. Belenergia submits that this regulatory capacity distinction

(6) Damages
(a) The compensation standard under international law

464. The Claimant argues that it is entitled to compensation pursuant to the principle of full
reparation set forth in the Permanent Court of International Justice’s (“PCIJ”) decision in

Chorzéw Factory:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act-
a principle which seems to be established by international practice and
in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals is that reparation
must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act
and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have
existed if that act had not been committed. °”

46: 17!

uw

Belenergia submits that the Chorzéw’s compensation standard is reproduced in Article 3
of the International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) 2001 Articles on Responsibility of States
for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC Articles on State Responsibility”), including the
need for causation between the harm and the wrongful act.®” It adds that full reparation

“shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in

combination” under Article 34 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.”

466. The Claimant agrees with Italy that the Chorzéw decision concerns the full reparation

674

principle, rather than damages quantification methods.’ Yet, the Claimant rejects the

Respondent’s argument that the expression “as far as possible” in the PCIS’s Chorzéw

decision limits its application in this arbitration. According to Belenergia, this expression

seeks merely to recognise that the principle of full reparation may not entirely “erase the

consequences of the wrongful act.”°7°

The Claimant equally rejects Italy’s argument that the Chorzdéw decision reproduced in
Article 34 of the ILC Articles on States Responsibility does not apply to investor-State
disputes. Belenergia submits that the Chorzéw case related to diplomatic protection, that is,
the protection of an individual in relation to a State, stating that Italy ignores “the
overwhelming number of investment tribunal decisions in which the Chorz6w Factory
principle has been applied” and that this principle is acknowledged “by nearly all academic

commentators.”°"®

The Claimant requests application of Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
as a customary law rule providing that compensation for an internationally wrongful act
“shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is
established.”*"’ Tt agrees with the reparation principle prohibiting double recovery.°”

The Claimant rejects Italy’s argument that the full reparation principle of Chorzéw does not

apply to damages caused by FET breaches but only to expropriation.°”

Conversely,
Belenergia argues that arbitral tribunals have consistently applied the Chorzéw’s principle to
breaches of investment protection standards other than expropriation, calculating actual loss

by the investor rather than the investment’s market value.°*°

Belenergia differs with Italy that damages should be reduced because of the measures’
general, regulatory character. It submits that Italy’s argument fails to present a calculation

method for a purported damages reduction, explaining that Italy’s reliance on

CMS vy. Argentina®! and Azurix v. Argentina is misplaced. Thus, the non-fraudulent

character of measures does not justify derogation from the full reparation principle.***

471. The Claimant also disagrees with the Respondent’s criticism on using the discounted cash
flow method (“DCF”) in cases other than expropriation. The Claimant adds that Italy
misunderstands Belenergia’s argument on damages (when referring to an “overall
assessment of the value of the investment in its entirety).* Belenergia explains that the
discounted cash flow method is “widely accepted” and is “the best method for valuing lost
profits,”°> taking account “the time value for money and the risk of uncertainty.”

According to the Claimant, Italy did not offer an “alternative method to account for the time

value of money and the risk of uncertainty in the quantification of future losses.”®*" It further

explains that the Tribunal should award the difference between the calculations of the
company’s fair market value before and after the implementation of the measures, stating
that:

[T]here is nothing wrong with using a DCF analysis in cases where

there is no total loss or deprivation of the asset, so long as the portion

of the profits lost as a result of the measures complained of can be
identified with precision.©**

the ECT; (ii) Italy’s circumstances do not compare to Argentina’s crisis in early 2000s; and (iii) there is no proof of
actual reduction in damages in the award. See Claimant’s Reply, 4] 596.

682 Belenergia submits that Italy omits part of the Annulment Committee’s reasoning in Azurix v. Argentina
(Exhibit RLA-31, 332), which actually supports application of the “fair market value” standard to cases other than
expropriation.

[The Alpha Value Report] [p]rojects the amount of money the SPVs

would have made if the Respondent’s PV pricing regime remained

constant as was promised in the Conventions, and the unbalancing costs

were not imposed on the SPVs. [It] [c]lompares this against the amount

of money the SPVs will actually make now that those measures have

been introduced. And, finally, [it] presents the differences between

these two figures as an amount to be paid in damages.™'
The Claimant highlights that the Respondent has failed to provide an alternative rate for the
3.5% DCF discount rate, which Belenergia argues suits the Italian PV sector.” The
Claimant relies on Mr. Rodriguez’s (Alpha Value) statements at the Hearing explaining,
among other things, that: (i) the 3.5% “synthetic default risk free rate” represents implicit
capital cost being the rate used for all companies within the STOXX 600 fixed by Alpha
Value’s head of strategy; (ii) the DCF discount rate is not interchangeable with the 6% rate
of working average cost of capital (CWACC”); (iii) using a 6% WACC rate as a proxy for
the discount rate would be hard to explain because the applicable rate should be close to
financing rates (Italy claims that Belenergia’s investment is low risk) and because PV returns
are stable.°” Belenergia also relies on Alpha Value Report No. | on the reasons for adopting
a low discount rate, these reasons being predictable revenues in the Italian PV sector, proven

output consistency by Belenergia’s PV plants, among others.°*

The Claimant further submits that a 0.6% annual degradation rate should apply founded on
the PV plants’ productivity decline.®* The Claimant disagrees with GRIF on a purported
0.8% rate suggested by a Canadian Solar’s performance guarantee of 90% over 25 years
because this rate does not consider that Belenergia’s plants are for shorter periods ranging

between 10 and 14 years.

Belenergia submits that Mr. Juan Camilo Rodriguez has made a few adjustments to the Alpha

Value Report, these adjustments were not “particularly significant.”

476. Belenergia also claims application of Article 38° of ILC Articles on State Responsibility

on interest as a customary international rule which ensures full reparation.°?

(b) Quantification of damages
477. In a preliminary note, the Claimant stresses that quantification by the Alpha Value Report
considers a “but for” scenario if Italy’s measures had not been adopted in the light of the
Chorzéw compensation standard.’ It also states that quantification considers the causation

requirement.”°!

478. The updated quantification of damages dated 10 April 2018 introduced some adjustments to
the previous quantification, including (a) tariff reduction of 7% rather than 8% in relation to
Acquaviva 2; (b) alternative calculations with a 0.6% and a 0.8% annual degradation rate.

Alpha Value presented the following scenarios:

(a) Scenario 1 assessing actual losses until 31 December 2016 with future losses
calculated from 1 January 2017, and with a 0.6% or a 0.8% annual degradation rate
(Scenario 1A and Scenario 1B, respectively), and used the average of the annual
impact to revenue based on historical production values from 2015 and 2016 to

calculate future losses.”

(b) Scenario 2 assessing actual losses until 31 December 2017 with future losses
calculated from 1 January 2018, and with a 0.6% or a 0.8% annual degradation rate
(Scenario 2A and Scenario 2B, respectively). Because 2017 actual production
values have not been reported under the official Dichiarazione di Consumo, Alpha

Value relied on the meter readings taken from Belenergia’s PV plants, and used the

©8 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38: “/. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter
shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall
be set so as to achieve that result. 2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until
the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.”

average of the annual impact to revenue based on historical production values from

2015 and 2017 to calculate future losses.”

(i) Quantification of damages caused by the adjustment of feed-in tariffs

Belenergia refers to the Alpha Value Report No. 1 quantifying actual and future lost profits
caused by the 8% reduction in “subsidies” (feed-in tariffs) from 1 January 2015 onwards.”
It submits that this Report calculated actual lost profits for 2015 of € 401,800 (reserving the

right to present numbers for 2016 and 2017).’”

According to the Claimant, the Alpha Value Report No. 1 calculates future lost profits at
€ 6,402,900 adopting the discounted-cash-flow analysis with a low discount rate (at the

valuation date 1 January 2017).7°°

On the basis of the adjustments and updates in Alpha Value Report No. 3, the Claimant seeks
total losses caused by the adjustment of feed-in tariffs of € 6,940,00 (of which € 1,533,300

are actual losses), applying Scenario 2A.7”

The Claimant rejects Italy’s objections to the quantification above, among other reasons,
because (a) Italy adopts the wrongful assumption that Claimant used PVGIS 3 data when the
Claimant actually used PVSYST data on production estimates; and (b) Italy quantifies
damages on the basis of “expectations” by reference to wrongful assumptions, including
unofficial production estimates such as PVGIS 3, rather than on the basis of what the

Claimant “did receive/should have received.”"™

The Claimant further highlights that GRIF’s alternative calculation of € 5,707,900 as total
losses is close to the Alpha Value Report No. 1’s number. The Claimant submits that GRIF
explains that these differences are caused by (a) the application of the 0.8% (rather than
0.6%) annual degradation rate; (b) Alpha Value had applied a wrong tariff reduction rate for
the PV plant Acquaviva 2 (8% rather than 7%); (c) Alpha Value should have used 2016

production data as a starting point of future loss calculation; and (d) Alpha Value should
have reduced in 41% losses of Solar Solution Puglia SRL because Belenergia holds only a
59% stake interest in this entity.” The Claimant disagrees about items (a), (c), and (d),
insisting that a 0.6% annual degradation rate applies, that Alpha Value’s average of annual
impact to revenue based on actual production values should apply, and that Solar Solution
Puglia SRL is entitled to claim 100% of the losses as a controlling shareholder.”!° On this
last point, the Claimant submits that even if the Tribunal finds that Solar Solution Puglia
SRL is not entitled to claim 100% of losses, this would result in a reduction of feed-in-tariff

loss of 2.44%.7!!

(ii) Quantification of damages caused by the adjustment of guaranteed
minimum price
The Claimant argues that the minimum price was advantageous compared to “Jower prices
fixed through bilateral power purchasing agreements or by selling directly into the
wholesale electricity market.””'? It then refers to the Alpha Value Report quantifying actual
and future lost profits caused by Italy’s measures repealing the fixed minimum price for
electricity, noting their application from 1 January 2014 onwards (further price reductions

applying from 1 January 2017 onwards).’°

Belenergia cites the Alpha Value Report’s quantification of actual lost profits for years 2014
and 2015 at € 1,009,740, reserving the right to present figures for 2016 and 2017.7'* In turn,
the Claimant presents quantification of future lost profits pursuant to a discounted cash flow
analysis at € 8,183,400 (reserving the right to provide an accurate calculation at the date of

the award).7>

On the basis of the adjustments and updates in Alpha Value Report No. 3, the Claimant

submits that quantification of losses has to consider the 50% cut by AEEG

Claimant seeks € 8,753,200 (of which € 2,270,600 are actual losses), applying Scenario

487. The Claimant rejects GRIF’s quantification because it “artificially deflate[s]’ the loss
amount staring the loss calculation after the 50% cut, failing therefore the present an
alternative quantification.”'° If the Tribunal finds that calculation should start after the 50%
cut, then the Claimant indicates that the GRIF Report quantifies the loss as in excess of
€ 134,711 (of which € 15,557.30 are actual losses for 2016, to which actual losses for 2014
and 2015 should be added).””°

(a) € 115,000 in legal due diligence;
(b) € 13,000 in technical due diligence; and
(c) €300,000 in MPS banking fees.’”°

On the basis of the adjustments and updates in Alpha Value Report No. 2, the Claimant seeks
(a) additional € 724,814.45 caused by the increased duration of loans after their
renegotiation; (b) additional € 30,000 in MPS banking fees; and (c) additional unquantified
costs incurred in debt renegotiation and additional unquantified interest costs.’”” Thus, the
Claimant seeks a total of € 1,182,814.45 compensation for direct costs.’"° According to the

Claimant, these costs were not challenged by Italy.’”?

According to Belenergia, the feed-in tariff reduction and the minimum price repeal led to
difficulties in equity financing other biomass and wind power projects.”*° In this respect, the

the Claimant “is not in a position at the date of [its] Memorial to provide further evidence of
its cost of borrowing at the relevant time,” it argues that the costs of borrowing correspond
to the borrowing costs of Belenergia’s group of companies.”*4 The Claimant states that the
Parties do not disagree on whether interest is recoverable, but that they disagree on the

applicable interest rate and on whether interest be compound.”*°

The Claimant rejects Italy’s position that the interest rate should not consider Belenergia’s
subjective position, arguing that interest has a compensatory function enshrined in Article 38
of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and reproduced in arbitral decisions.”*° The
Claimant adds that Alpha Value has applied 3.06% as the appropriate interest rate, and that

Italy has not proposed an alternative rate.’*”

The Claimant also argues that interest shall be compounded quarterly to adequately

compensate for Belenergia’s losses.”*

Belenergia rejects Italy’s objection to compound
interest as speculative, unfair, disproportionate, and inappropriate if applied to recent
damage. The Claimant submits that compounding interest is a “normal” compensatory, not

punitive practice, citing Santa Elena v. Costa Rica,’*? among other authorities.””°

Belenergia further states that interest on out of pocket and indirect losses shall accrue from
the date of submission of the Request for Arbitration, and that interest on loss of profit shall
accrue from the date when profit would have occurred, calculated yearly.” In both cases,

interest shall run until payment.”4?

496. Later the Claimant modified its position on pre-award interest, stating that both interest on

(a) direct and indirect expenses; and (b) lost revenue shall accrue “from the date on which
those expenses were incurred or revenue would originally have realised until the date of the
Final Award,” calculated yearly at a 3.06% rate on a compound basis.”° In the Claimant’s
view, the same rate should apply to post-award interest, noting that its experts can update the

Alpha Value Report No. 3 once the Tribunal decides on damages and interest.’+

B. The Respondent’s Position

(1) Italy Has Not Breached the FET Standard under Article 10(1) ECT

497. Italy agrees with Belenergia that good faith and proportionality underlie the FET standard.”>

Italy also agrees that this standard covers “legitimate expectations” existing at the time the

investment was made.”°

Italy disagrees, however, that the FET standard under Article 10(1) FET is “self-contained;”
rather, it argues that the FET standard is a general clause to be interpreted in accordance with
general, evolving international law.” Italy adds that the Tribunal should consider Italian
law when determining whether Italy breached the ECT and the fact that the Italian

Constitutional Court held that the Spalma Incentivi Decree was constitutional.”

According to the Respondent, the expression “expectations” refers to “representations of
future legal facts and acts, which foreign investors derive from the conduct of the authorities
of a State, and on whose basis they made their investment.” Italy defines the qualifier
“legitimate” as representations “worthy of protection under international law” that consider

the States’ sovereign, regulatory right to modify their legislation.”

several decisions,”! including in Charanne v. Spain and Blusun v. Italy, holding that

investors could not have legitimately expected that PV regulation “would remain unchanged

752

for the lifetime of their plants,”"? and declining “to sanctify laws as promises.”"”* It also

distinguishes this arbitration from Eiser v. Spain because there has been no radical, total,

unreasonable regulatory changes, let alone full disruption of the investment.”

Italy favours the approach taken by the /solux and Charanne tribunals and disagrees with the
Masdar v. Spain tribunal’s reasoning, noting that this tribunal gives too much weight to
letters granting tariffs when these letters simply result from renewable energy regulation and

as such cannot be considered “specific commitments” towards an investor.”>>

Italy also denies that the disputed measures lack good faith.”° The FET standard under
Article 10(1) ECT does not have a chilling effect on States’ regulatory activity; on the
contrary, a purported FET stabilisation (freezing) clause would rather lead to imbalance.”*”
But rather, stability implies reasonable and proportionate legislative changes such as the
measures adopted “within a time span of more than ten years, by different governments and

within a clearly traced EU framework.””*

Therefore, Italy argues that Belenergia could not have legitimately expected that Italy’s PV
regulatory framework would not be subject to legislative changes, because: (i) the GSE
Conventions and Italy’s regulatory scheme on feed-in tariffs could not have created
Belenergia’s alleged legitimate expectations; (ii) the Spalma Incentivi Decree was
reasonable and proportionate, with no procedural or substantive impropriety; (iii) neither

Italy’s regulatory scheme nor GSE Conventions on minimum prices could have created

prices and imbalance charges, having contested only the Spalma Incentivi Decree in its

Reply.”°°

(a) The GSE Conventions and Italy’s regulatory scheme on feed-in tariffs
could not have created Belenergia’s alleged legitimate expectations

505. If the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the claims founded on the GSE
Conventions—quod non—Italy argues that the GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs could not
have created Belenergia’s purported legitimate expectations that these tariffs would not
change.” Italy refers to Professor Rojas’ First Opinion”! and to Professor Rojas’ Second
Opinion that the GSE Conventions are “accessory contracts” (“contratti accessivi’”) to public

acts and thus instruments of regulation.” According to Professor Rojas, the GSE

Conventions’ changes result from integrating statutory changes.” In this context, Italy

argues that the pacta sunt servanda principle is irrelevant.”

506. Italy submits that the GSE Conventions’ obligations on the duration and content of incentives

agreements reached with GSE cannot be qualified as contracts meant to determine the exclusive profit of the operator,
with terms and conditions blocked at the initial conditions, for twenty years, even if technological conditions may
change profoundly. They are instead regulatory instruments, aimed at reaching the objective of incentivizing certain
sources of energy in equilibrium with other sources of renewable energy, and with the minimum sacrifice for the users
who ultimately bear the economic burden.”

Professors Onida and Randazzo, referring to Professor Rojas’ testimony, noting that the

Italian legislator was entitled to modify the feed-in tariffs just like it is entitled to “set the

price of gas because it wants to mitigate the price of gas.”"™

507. The Respondent rejects Belenergia’s argument on Article 24(2)(d) of the Romani Decree™™
referring to GSE Conventions as “private contracts” (“contratti privati”). First, Italy

disagrees that Claimant could rely on an act adopted after its investment on estoppel

169

grounds. Second, Italy states that a private law contract may have an “accessory”

character under Italian law.’”” Third, Italy submits that Belenergia omits the full quote of
Article 24(2)(d) of the Romani Decree referring to the non-negotiable regulatory terms of the

standard contract, as follows:

[IJincentives are allotted through private contracts between the GSE
and the subject responsible for the system on the basis of a standard
contract defined by the Authority for Energy, Electricity and Gas.””

without agreement of the parties “refer{] to the GSE as party to the agreement and not the
legislative branch of the Italian Republic.”"” PV plant owners did not have to conclude
GSE Conventions to be entitled to incentives; receipt of a GSE’s letter confirming incentives

No. 10795/2017.’ Although this decision on conflicts of jurisdiction was about jurisdiction
and not the merits, the Corte di Cassazione decided on the character of GSE Conventions to
be able to determine jurisdiction.”” Italy explains that in this case the Corte di Cassazione
sat as United Chambers, which means that Decision No. 10795/2017 becomes relevant for
lower civil and administrative courts.””° According to Italy, the United Chambers concluded
that the question of modification of GSE Conventions fell within the jurisdiction of
administrative courts under Article 133 of the Italian Code of Administrative Procedure.’””
And to reach this conclusion the Corte di Cassazione referred to Decision No. 16/2017 of
the Italian Constitutional Court affirming the accessory character of GSE Conventions and
confirming the constitutionality of Article 26 of Spalma Incentivi Decree.””* Italy cites the
Corte di Cassazione Decision stating that when concluding the GSE Conventions the GSE
has not acted as a mere private counterparty but as public administration “destined to operate
in a position of supremacy through the exercise of authoritative powers”’” and that the
dispute was not merely of private nature requiring consideration of administrative measures

and ius imperii matters. 7°

Italy concludes that the “hybrid nature of the GSE position towards investors cannot be a
clearer confirmation of Italy’s argument that the GSE Conventions do not have (as claimed
by the Claimant and his experts) a mere private law nature.””*! According to Italy, Professor
Rojas’ Opinion confirms that the GSE did not unilaterally modify the GSE Conventions;

depended on the general regulatory framework.’*? In any event, Italy submits that even if

legislator was entitled to change them because new legislation can affect vested rights
(“consolidated subjective rights”) and because Article 1339 of the Italian Civil Code

authorised this change.’*

511. Moreover, Italy’s regulatory regime of feed-in tariffs could not have created legitimate

expectations on Belenergia because the regime had a “gratuity” character, proportionate to
produced energy, granted in addition to PV plants’ sales at market prices or at minimum
prices.’** Italy relies on Professor Rojas’ testimony, submitting that GSE Conventions on
feed-in tariffs refer to a subsidy, which is no contractual obligation and does not create

bilateral reciprocal obligations.”*>

512. Italy submits that Belenergia made its investment after the adoption of EU

Directive 2009/28/EC requiring PV incentives’ stability and tariffs/effective costs matching
(Italy having adopted one of the most favourable PV regimes); also, Belenergia made its
investment when PV earnings were already high, costs having highly decreased.’*°
Belenergia entered the Italian market “at a very late stage, when the support mechanism was
close to reach its sustainability limits.”"*" In Italy’s view, the Ministerial Decrees setting up
the Energy Accounts were secondary measures implementing primary legislation enshrined
in Article 7 of Legislative Decree No. 387/20037** (for Energy Accounts I to III) and in
Article 24 of the Romani Decree’ (for Energy Accounts IV to V), which in turn
implemented EU directives, the Spalma Incentivi Decree having merely reshaped these

incentives.”

These provisions established incentives with “decreasing amount and
duration,” corresponding to the rationale of the “successive changes” underlying each

Energy Account.””! It adds that the Romani Decree’ adopted in 2011 before Belenergia’s

investment introduced sharp changes to the incentives’ regime (reducing the duration and

amount of incentives under Energy Account II).”> The Romani Decree “recognized the need

to reconsider tariffs because of excessive burdens.””*

The Respondent adds that the
Spalma Incentivi Decree could not have come as a surprise because it was adopted after the
2013 regulatory changes of the Destinazione Italia Decree “proposing the same re-
modulation on a facultative basis.” Italy adds that other European States like Spain had

also reduced incentives.”°°

Italy further argues that the Claimant’s due diligence reports do not address Italian regulatory
changes,’ noting that the investments were made when the Italian market “had already

reached a critical point.””*

According to Italy, Mr. Levy confirmed that Belenergia
invested in Casamassima Solare SRL, Compagnia Solare 2 SRL, Compagnia Solare 3 SRL
and Puglia Energia SRL before obtaining the GSE letter granting the feed-in tariff and thus
before concluding the GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs.” Italy adds that Belenergia has
only produced in this arbitration due diligence reports covering the PV SPVs Compagnia
Solare 1 SRL and Compagnia Solare 3 SRL, and that a preliminary due diligence report

covers the SPV Puglia Energia SRL: neither of them examine Italian regulatory risks.

The Respondent also argues that the provision on assignment of receivables under the GSE
Conventions on feed-in tariffs “cannot in any way be seen as a form of guarantee provided
by the GSE to the banks in relation to the fact that the incentives would remain fixed and

immutable over time.”*°! Ttaly then relies on the testimony of Eng. Bacchiocchi:

MR BACCHIOCCHI: The assignment of the receivables was in essence
that the receivables, instead of being paid into the bank account of the
operator, were paid directly to the bank, but then any financing
agreements between the operator and the banks were not mentioned or
were not taken into account by this agreement. In fact, the financing
agreements had contractual logics which were completely different.

Otherwise, we would have a situation where GSE was basically
guaranteeing all the subjects that received incentives and this was not
the case. It was simply an instrument created to allow the mechanism to
be fluid regardless of any subjective relationships, contractual etc that
were entered into obviously in other places, though not within the GSE;
the GSE had no influence on the relationships that a subject had with
the banks.

[Counsel for Claimant]: Obviously here I'm talking about the guarantee
of the producers that used the assignment of receivables as a guarantee.

MR BACCHIOCCHI: Well, I think this should be seen within the context
of an assessment which belongs to investment decisions. These are
assessments that either operators or banks have to carry out
independently and without that this mechanism of the assignment of the
receivables may in any case influenced the contractual relationship
because the assignment of receivables simply provides that a transfer of
money, instead of being addressed to the operator, goes to the bank.
The mechanism of trust is based on the system of incentives, on the other
hand, there are other subjective considerations that the bank assessed
in relation to the subjects that then received the financing.®”

515. Italy therefore rejects Belenergia’s argument on legitimate expectations related to loans and
the banking sector: because the Claimant not being a bank, Italy was not responsible for

Belenergia’s business choices to rely on loans for investment.

516. Italy sustains that a general, regulatory framework cannot create “specific commitments.” It
accepts that Italian legislative and regulatory measures could have led to a reasonable
expectation of “stability” and of “equitable remuneration;” it does not accept, however,
Belenergia’s expectations that incentives stay frozen, “stabilised” for twenty years,
“irrespective of the fact that they proved to be excessive, and that they were not socially
sustainable any longer with the risk of failure of the system itself.” Ttaly further claims

5

that the FET standard cannot be equal to a stabilisation clause.*°> It refuses that a

stabilization clause was ever included in its PV regulation.*°°

517. Finally, Italy concludes that one of the pillars of the tariff incentives was that they ensure
sustainable, fair returns to PV plant owners associated with the average plant life, which is
the express language of Italian regulation that should have been known by an experimented

investor like Belenergia.*"’ The Spalma Incentivi Decree reduced feed-in tariffs to ensure

808

the incentives’ sustainability,°’* as confirmed by the witnesses Eng. Bacchiocchi and

Eng. Miraglia, and the expert Mr. Saraceno (Protos), as follows:

[Eng. Bacchiocchi] [T]he legislator therefore has the option to
intervene to stabilise the mechanism. We must not forget that if at some
point there are issues that are so serious that the entire mechanism and
system becomes unsustainable, then in this case we wouldn't be talking
about small remodulation of rates, but the entire mechanism would
collapse, would be put in danger. [...}*°°

MR MIRAGLIA: The measures in this Spalma-Incentivi is coherent
because this is a light regulation of the incentive system. The incentive
system is based on the tariffs that are defined in the ministerial decrees,
but these decrees enact wider principles that are determined by the laws
to which these decrees are subordinate. In particular, in all the
legislative decrees that determined the definition of the tariffs, the
criterion of fair remuneration of investment and operating costs has
always been referred to."

[Eng. Miraglia] So a possible tuning of the tariffs should have been
taken into account right from the start, because the criteria of fair
remuneration had been fixed since 2003 because Decree 387 Article 7
said that—and this generates the whole thing—these tariffs had to be
set in order to pay back, through fair remuneration, the investment and
the operating costs for the plant."!

[Counsel for Respondent]: The costs that are linked to the production
of solar panels, how much did these prices come down at that period of
time?

MR SARACENO: Quite a lot. I remember that in 2007 or 2008 when we
started to look into PV, IMW plant was 4 to 5 million, but then over
time, slowly, these prices came down quite a lot. At one point the cost
of these modules went up because there was a specific market situation
for the silicon, but generally, as we also said in our report, there was a

(b) The Spalma Incentivi Decree was reasonable and proportionate, with
no procedural or substantive impropriety
First of all, Italy readjusted feed-in tariffs with the Spalma Incentivi Decree by reducing them
not cutting them, as an emergency measure to tackle the economic crisis. According to Italy,
the A3 cost component of electricity consumer bills covering the cost of renewable energy
incentives including PV had become too burdensome to consumers and unsustainable.*!*
Although the tariff reduction was substantial, it was not “crippling or disabling”, but

proportionate to the reduction of PV technology costs.*!+

Rejecting Belenergia’s bad faith accusations,*'> Italy agrees with the Claimant that
Article 10(1) ECT requires that a “rational policy” underlie Italy’s measures.*'° The
Respondent states that the Spalma Incentivi Decree sought to readjust the incentives
promoting renewable energy production, in the light of a “genuine general interest” and

“fully legitimate macro policy stances” 3”

Rebalancing was a “rational measure” consistent with the evolution of European and Italian
regimes, because (a) reduced production costs had generated excessive incentives borne by
consumers; (b) electricity cost for Italian SMEs was 30% more expensive than in other EU
Member States;*'® (c) increase in consumers’ electricity bills was attributable to PV

incentives; (d) electricity consumption dropped in the relevant years.*!°

Italy also states that returns of Belenergia’s plants are higher than estimated at the time of

£820

the investment citing an excerpt from the First GRIF Report, as follows:

Based on such data, Italian policy-maker valued the feed-in tariffs to be
granted to RES plants, in order to make these investments profitable in

light of the industry's average yields. Investors made, on the same basis,
their financial plans and assessed their expected yields. Practical
experience has also revealed that the PVGIS-3 data underestimated
solar radiation levels, with the result that actual plant output could be
higher than had been initially estimated. The PVGIS database was
accordingly updated, foreseeing, when compared with PVGIS-3, a
significant average increase in solar radiation. In the light thereof, the
plants’ production levels increased well beyond expectations, giving
rise, on the one hand, to an abnormal increase in the companies’
profitability, which went far beyond the reasonable assumptions made
when the investments were made and, on the other hand, to an excessive
amount of costs being incurred by end consumers, which adversely
affected the efficient allocation of resources.
By way of conclusion, it can be stated that the “Spalma-incentivi”

Decree was only intended to partially correct this gap, by cutting the

feed-in tariffs in a manner that was not in proportion to the increases in

productivity that the plants were experiencing. The overall result has

been a reduction in consumer spending without this adversely affecting

in any way the plants’ financial forecasts, and investors continue to

make profits that go well beyond what was initially forecasted.*”!
Italy refers to the recitals of EU Directive 2009/28/EC on needed regulatory review seeking
stability and cost-effectiveness,*”? and to the 2012 European Commission’s Communication
on Renewable Energy on the 48% decrease of PV costs and on needed cost-effectiveness
reforms.*?? Italy explains that it initially attempted to favour voluntary adjustment
mechanisms with the Destinazione Italia Decree in 2013, but in the end chose to reform the

Energy Accounts with the Spalma Incentivi Decree in 2014.

The Respondent denies that the Spalma Incentivi Decree was substantively improper.**
First, the Spalma Incentivi Decree was reasonable because Italy sought to readjust (not
eliminate) the disproportionate PV investors’ remuneration and the excessive burdens on
consumers leading to reduced consumption. Second, the Spalma Incentivi Decree was
proportionate, consistent with a rational policy: rebalancing was achieved keeping PV

remuneration above market prices, not jeopardising PV plants’ profitability.* Third, the

Spalma Incentivi Decree was reasonable, consistent with Italian and European policies
enshrined in Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 (requiring an “equitable remuneration”) and
EU Directive 2009/28/EC. According to the Respondent, the Blusun v. Italy award and the

Italian Constitutional Court’s Decision No. 16/2017 confirm this.5”°

524. Italy adds that the measures had no retroactive effect and offered safeguards.**’ | The
Respondent explains that the measures reduced only payment of future tariffs not past tariffs
already granted.*** According to the Respondent, Italian law does prohibit that a new law
affect pre-existing subjective rights (except for criminal law), noting that the Constitutional
Court has affirmed this principle in Decision No. 16/2017.*?° Italy submits that Decision
No. 16/2017 also confirms the proportionality of the Spalma Incentivi Decree in light of
Italian law and of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”).** Italy adds that
the Constitutional Court Decision No. 92/2013 relied on by Professors Onida and Randazzo
is irrelevant to the retroactivity argument, because it discussed cancellation of tariffs due to

services that had already been performed.**!

525. Italy equally denies that the Spalma Incentivi Decree was procedurally improper.**
Preliminarily, Italy submits that this argument has only been raised in Belenergia’s Reply
and thus should be dismissed by the Tribunal.**? According to Italy, Belenergia failed to
satisfy its burden of proof that the Spalma Incentivi Decree lacked due process or

transparency .°™#

526. Italy states that due process and transparency in international investment arbitration relate to

Italian legislative procedures.**>

Italy refers to the Second GRIF Report as a response to Claimant’s submissions on

underestimation of irradiation levels.°°°

(c) Neither Italy’s regulatory scheme nor GSE Conventions on minimum
prices could have created legitimate expectations
In a preliminary note, Italy points out that the minimum prices claim “should be dismissed
by the Tribunal due to the implicit renunciation by the Claimant and its acquiescence to the

Respondent’s arguments.”**7

Italy states that Belenergia has failed to indicate which acts created its legitimate
expectations, inferring that the Claimant may have referred to the AEGG Resolution
No. 618/2013 and to the Destinazione Italia Decree.*** Italy also identifies two aspects of
Belenergia’s purported expectations on minimum prices: the amount of minimum prices and
their duration.** Italy clarifies that the goal of these instruments was not “eliminating such
regime, but simply [...] removing the possibility, for medium and large PV plants with a

capacity above 100Kw, to enjoy of both minimum prices and incentive tariffs.”*“°

Italy rejects that the GSE Conventions on minimum prices could have created legitimate
expectations on Belenergia because they had a 1 one-year duration, founded on
AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007.**! The Respondent also submits that the primary rules,
Article 13 of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and Article 1(41) of Law No. 239/2004, do
not set up minimum prices; they merely set up the off-take regime to be adopted by the

AEEG. No expectations could have therefore arisen from these primary rules.*4?

S

The Respondent explains that the first AEEG Resolution No. 34/2005 provided minimum
prices only to the first 2 million kWh early produced by each plant. Later,
AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007**? reshapes the off-take regime, determining that minimum
prices are yearly determined by the AEEG under Article 7(1) of its Annex A.*+ According
to Italy, this “exclude[s] any expectation regarding the exercise of such power by the
Authority, except for the hypothesis of an abusive exercise.”**° It adds that the reference
“ensuring the economic survival of smaller plants’ in the preamble of
AEEG No. Resolution 280/2007 cannot justify expectations of “a high and durable

profitability separated from the economic conditions of the investment.”**°

(d) The 2013 Destinazione Italia Decree and the AEEG Resolution

No. 618/2013 reducing minimum prices were reasonable and consistent

with Italy’s regulatory framework
Italy argues that the 2013 reform granted to PV investors minimum level prices covering
operational costs and “ensuring economic survival of smaller plants.”**7 The
AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013 setting up 2014 minimum prices lower than those granted
between 2008 and 2013 was reasonable and coherent with the objectives of the minimum
prices system. Based on a report by the Politecnico di Milano,*** Italy argues that the
AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013 ensured “economic survival” of plants covering their

operational costs with basic capital remuneration.*4?

The Respondent argues that the AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013 was preceded by a long
debate with stakeholders.*°° It also took into account technical data showing that previous
minimum prices were detached from production costs at the time, harming electricity
consumers.**! The AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013 was also coherent with the primary rules

under Article 13(3) and(4) of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and under Article 1(41) of

(“condizioni economiche di mercato”).®>*

Finally, Italy rejects Belenergia’s criticism of the Destinazione Italia Decree of 2013 when
not allowing certain plants to combine minimum prices and feed-in tariffs. First, the
Respondent argues that no rule suggests that minimum prices and feed-in tariffs should be
combined.** Second, authorised combination of minimum prices and feed-in tariffs by
smaller plants not exceeding 100kWh is reasonable in relation to the preamble of
AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013 requiring “the economic survival of smaller plants.”**+
Third, the Destinazione Italia Decree was preceded by a long debate, starting with the

Romani Decree*** of 2011 preceding Belenergia’s investment.**°

(2) Italy Has Not Breached the Prohibition against Unreasonable and
Discriminatory Measures under Article 10(1) ECT
Italy submits that there is “a broad or complete overlapping between the FET standard” and
the prohibition against unreasonable and discriminatory measures under Article 10(1) ECT,
citing the Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan case.’ Thus, Italy states that the measures’
reasonableness should be dealt with under the FET standard, referring back to its arguments
on the FET standard.*** It states that this is confirmed by the Claimant when referring to the
“reasonableness” and “unpredictability” of the measures, rather than to their

“discriminatory” character.*°?

(3) Italy Has Not Breached the Most Constant Protection and Security Obligation

The Respondent rejects Belenergia’s accusation that Italy breached the FPS standard under
Article 10(1) ECT. Italy explains that this standard is limited to “preventing and protecting

aliens from violence and harassment.”>®

Italy adds that defining the FPS standard broadly would lead to substantial overlap with the

FET standard, citing Houben v. Burundi.®°!

Because Belenergia did not raise different
arguments from those raised under the FET standard, Italy refers back to its arguments on

the FET standard.5

(4) Italy Has Not Breached the Umbrella Clause under Article 10(1) ECT

If the Tribunal affirms jurisdiction over the umbrella clause claim or declares its
admissibility—quod non—Italy argues that the umbrella clause claim is unfounded.*® Italy
submits that the application of umbrella clauses is controversial. Because they derogate from
the international law principle on the separation between international and domestic

obligations, umbrella clauses should be interpreted restrictively.**

First, Italy’s regulatory scheme could not have led to specific commitments toward
Belenergia.*°> Second, Italy states that it is unclear from Belenergia’s Statement of Claim
whether it refers to GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs or to GSE Conventions on minimum
prices. It submits that GSE Conventions on minimum prices had a one-year duration, which
makes it impossible to sustain an umbrella clause claim.*® It also submits that Belenergia

has given up its umbrella claim in relation to minimum prices in its Reply.*”

540. Third, Italy agrees with the Claimant that an umbrella clause “internationalises” contract
breaches.*® In its view, a condition to the application of umbrella clauses is that contract
breaches be founded on “contractual” obligations. Italy refers to Noble Ventures v. Romania
confirming that the umbrella clause relates to contractual obligations and not to “general
commitments, for example[,] by way of legislative acts.”* It differs with Belenergia that
the umbrella clause includes obligations undertaken by States in their “function as sovereign

or as a merchant in a commercial transaction.”5”

54

=

Italy states that the GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs and on minimum prices have a
statutory and not a “contractual” character; rather, they are mere “accessory contracts”
transposing legal provisions into a contract as “a sort of appendix of legislative or regulatory
provisions.”*”' Because the duration and amount of incentives under the GSE Conventions
on feed-in tariffs and on minimum prices were previously determined by a public law source,
claims concerning them should be discussed under the FET standard.*”? It differs with

Belenergia that it is estopped from arguing so.5”?

Italy also submits that interpretation of Article 10(1) ECT under the VCLT confirms this.

Article 10(1) ECT, sustaining that it could not have entered into concrete, specific,
contractual commitments through adopting general regulatory measures.*”* The effet utile
principle suggests that the Tribunal should not interpret the umbrella clause as overlapping

with the FET standard; rather, the umbrella clause should be interpreted restrictively.*”>

inconsistent with privity of contract.*’* Third, the challenged measures being general, not
aimed at Belenergia, and compliant with the FET standard, the Tribunal should reject the
Belenergia’s umbrella clause claim.*”? Fourth, the umbrella clause does not change the
contract’s proper law; international law intervenes at a later stage if pursuant to domestic law
there has been a contract breach.**° Decision No. 16/2017**! of the Italian Constitutional
Court confirms that the Spalma Incentivi Decree pursued legitimate goals, being valid and

lawful.88?

(5) Italy Has Not Breached the Obligation not to Discriminate under Articles 10(2)
and 10(3) ECT

The Respondent denies that Articles 10(2) and 10(3) ECT apply in this arbitration. In its
view, “Treatment” referred in Article 10(3) ECT refers to the “Making of Investments” under
Article 10(2) ECT, which is confirmed by the use of the same expression “Making of
Investments” in Article 10(4) ECT.*** It then refers*** to the definition of “Making of
Investments” under Article 1(8) ECT, which reads that:

“Make Investments” or “Making of Investments” means establishing

new Investments, acquiring all or part of existing Investments or moving

into different fields of Investment activity.
Therefore, Articles 10(2) and 10(3) ECT cannot apply to the challenged measures, because

their adoption was long after Belenergia’s “Making of Investments” with acquisition of the

entities and schools (“enti locali o scuole”) from the Spalma Incentivi Decree’s application
applies to public entities and schools whose situation is not comparable to the PV plant

owners’ situation.**

547. First, public entities and schools are non-profit entities; PV plant owners are for-profit

entities.8°° Second, public entities and schools primarily produce energy for their own use;
PV plant owners produce energy primarily for sale.*°! This shows that the exemption under

Law No. 164/2014 seeks specific and legitimate public goals.*%*

Tt submits that the only
public entity cited by Belenergia is AVCP (today ANAC), the supervisory authority

monitoring public contracts and fighting corruption.*”*

548. Italy further denies that its measures discriminate against larger PV plants. In its view, the

measures’ rational policy differentiates between PV plants with different sizes, which is a
logic and normal regulatory practice in advanced economies.*™* It adds that smaller PV

plants’ renewable energy production is primarily for self-consumption.**

(6) Damages
550. Italy submits that Belenergia is not entitled to compensation. If the Tribunal decides,
however, to grant compensation, Italy rejects the criteria for calculation and the quantum of
compensation submitted by Belenergia, relying on the First and Second GRIF Reports, and
on the GRIF Financial Report.*””

(a) The compensation standard

551. Contrary to Belenergia’s position, Italy objects that the full reparation principle of Chorzéw
Factory applies. It submits that the PCIJ used the expression “as far as possible” when
referring to the full reparation principle, by that mitigating its application.*°* Rather than

setting a criterion for damages quantification, the PCIJ compared restitution and

compensation for international wrongful acts.*””

552. Italy submits that the ILC Articles on State Responsibility apply only to obligations between
States, not between States and individuals.” It also states that the full reparation principle

has to be mitigated when there is no expropriation, fair market value calculation being limited

1

to expropriation cases.°°! In its view, the Tribunal should consider when calculating

damages: (i) the measures’ general, regulatory character; (ii) the absence of fraudulent intent;
(iii) the investment’s high profitability; and (iv) the absence of material harm to the

investment.”

(b) Quantification of damages
553. First of all, Italy submits that Belenergia cannot claim compensation in the absence of
injury. According to the Respondent, when setting up the incentives regime Italy relied
on the PVGIS database to calculate PV incentives; Belenergia production levels are much
higher than the production estimated on the basis of the PVGIS database: this database was
later proven unsatisfactory because it underestimated the solar irradiation levels in Italy.?*

Irrespective of the solar irradiation database used by Belenergia (PVSYST rather than

) 005

PVGIS as recognised during the Hearing the Respondent refers to the testimony of

Professor Quaglione (GRIF) to argue that Belenergia could not have expected that incentives
would not change when it was proven that solar irradiation level was much higher than

expected:

[Professor Quaglione] [T]he expectations that Belenergia must have
had at the beginning of the process must be based on the same data as
the ones contained in the PVGIS-3 database. So the conservative ones.
The reason why we are assuming this is that if they had more generous
expectations, they, as professional operators, should have immediately
understood that they were obtaining extra profits which was not
compatible with any regulatory intervention. So there are two options.
Either they recognised immediately that they were obtaining extra
profits and then they could expect a cut in the future, or they had the
same expectations as the government and so we are right on this path.°°°

 

554. Moreover, Italy also challenges Mr. Rodriguez’s expertise in the PV sector (as recognised
by Counsel for Claimant), highlighting several errors made in his reports.”

555. The Respondent rejects Belenergia’s reliance on the discounted cash flow method for
quantifying damages. In its view, this method is used for calculating the fair market value
of an investment, typically used in expropriation cases.” Italy explains that, if the Tribunal

decides to calculate compensation, it has to consider that Belenergia’s investment persists

“fully operational and profitable.”°? The Tribunal should avoid income-based calculation

methods such as the discounted cash flow method leading to “speculative,” “unpredictable,

“excessive remuneration of the invested capital;” rather, the Tribunal should consider the
expected equitable capital remuneration, reduced energy costs, and PV market and industry

developments.?!”

556. Italy objects to Belenergia’s quantification applying the discounted cash flow method, being
“methodologically erroneous to sum the assessment of actual lost profits with a calculation
of the value of the investment according to the DCF method” made in relation to feed-in

tariffs and minimum prices.?!!

557. Italy equally objects that out of pocket expenses and other indirect costs could be
compensated.?'? The Claimant has failed to show that these losses related to the challenged

measures; rather, they are unforeseeable losses and result from “autonomous entrepreneurial

choices.”

558. Italy further submits that Belenergia’s damages calculation is incorrect. It explains that the

GRIF Reports and the GRIF Financial Report show that its SPVs’ returns are higher than

originally expected despite the Spalma Incentivi Decree reducing the feed-in tariffs.°!+

559. The GRIF Reports and the GRIF Financial Report also show, first, that there should be no
compensation for measures on minimum prices, and, second, that the correct compensation

of an alleged compensation would “almost annul” the amount calculated by Belenergia.?!°

the calculation presented by Belenergia affect the legitimacy of its claims.?!? The

Respondent reserves its right to present future estimates of damages.°””

(7) Interest

563. The Respondent denies that the interest rate should be “based on the subjective position of

the Claimant.”°*!

564. Italy also rejects interest compound on a quarterly basis because simple interest “is less
speculative and better reflects the circumstances of the case.”°”” It further explains that the
Tribunal should apply simple interest because (i) the alleged damages are recent; (ii) the
measures have public policy objectives; (iii) Belenergia had already received high incentives

(making compound interest unfair and disproportionate).?”*

C. The Tribunal’s Decision

Article 10(1) ECT; (2) the umbrella clause under Article 10(1) ECT; (3) the most constant

568.

(1) Has Italy Breached the FET Obligation under Article 10(1) ECT?
(a) The applicable FET standard

The Parties disagree to a certain extent on the applicable FET standard under
Article 10(1) ECT. The Claimant sustains that the FET standard under the ECT is an
objective and self-contained standard that is not limited to the minimum standard of
treatment under customary international law, referring to VCLT interpretation principles on
the basis of the text of Article 10(1) ECT in light of the ECT’s object and purpose. The
Claimant further sustains that FET requires that the host State (i) observe the investor’s
legitimate expectations; and that the host State refrain from acting in a manner that is
(ii) procedurally improper or (iii) substantially improper. Belenergia submits that the
protection of legitimate expectations is a “dominant” element of FET, including good faith
considerations. According to the Claimant, legitimate expectations can relate to legal and
regulatory stability or arise from the investor’s reliance on specific commitments by the host

State.

In turn, Italy disagrees that the FET standard is self-contained under Article 10(1) ECT.
According to Italy, this standard should be interpreted in accordance with international law.
Italy further submits that legitimate expectations have to consider the States’ sovereign right
to regulate to be worthy of international law protection. Among other sources, Italy cites the
Charanne and the Blusun decisions refusing to sanctify laws as promises when legal and

regulatory changes are reasonable and proportionate.

The Tribunal is satisfied that FET under the ECT is set forth in its Article 10(1) ECT, which
provides an autonomous, self-contained definition of FET, with no reference to the minimum

standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law, as follows:

(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other
Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments
shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no
Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use,

208

569.

570.

571.

572.

enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded

treatment less favourable than that required by international law,

including treaty obligations. [...]
As Article 10(1) ECT provides that treatment, including FET, cannot be “less favourable
than that required by international law,” it requires treatment that is not strictly equivalent
to international law. This non-restrictive standard confers on the Tribunal some

interpretation leeway.

Arbitral tribunals have found FET violations when State conduct (a) goes against investors’
legitimate expectations; (b) denies justice and due process; (c) is arbitrary, discriminatory,
and abusive. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the protection of legitimate

expectations is a key element of FET.

To be legitimate, investors’ expectations must not be frivolous or unrealistic and must be
grounded in reality. As the Duke Energy v. Ecuador tribunal rightly put it:
To be protected, the investor’s expectations must be legitimate and
reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The
assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account
all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the
investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical
conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations
must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the
latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest.?**
The Tribunal agrees with Italy that the FET obligation does not prevent host States’
regulatory autonomy. In Saluka v. Czech Republic, the tribunal held that “[nJo investor may
reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made

remain totally unchanged” and that whether expectations are justified and reasonable takes

into account “the host State’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in

the public interest.” °° This means that legitimate regulatory activity in the public interest

does not amount to an FET breach even if it adversely affects investments.°?°

(b) Application of the FET standard
Legitimate expectations

Belenergia submits that Italy undertook explicit and implicit specific commitments toward
PV investors through regulatory and contractual instruments, citing Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003 and Legislative Decree No. 28/2011 on feed-in tariffs, Ministerial
decrees setting up Energy Accounts I to V on feed-in tariffs, AEEG Resolutions No. 34/2005
and 280/2007 on minimum prices, and the GSE Conventions concluded with Belenergia’s

SPVs on feed-in tariffs and minimum prices.

Belenergia admits that the successive Energy Accounts progressively reduced the feed-in
tariffs, and that the last two of which introduced an annual costs cap. However, it points out
that this succession of reduced feed-in tariffs did not affect the 20-year feed-in tariffs granted
to its SPVs pursuant to GSE Conventions already concluded, based on a “grandfathering”
mechanism. It also submits that the regulatory and contractual 20-year term for feed-in
tariffs was based on the 20-year estimate of the PV plants’ life and that its SPVs concluded
Joan agreements relying on the 20-year feed-in tariff receivables assignable to banks pursuant

to the GSE Conventions.

The Claimant sustains that the Spalma Incentivi Decree of 24 June 2014 later confirmed by
Conversion Law No. 116//2014 reduced the feed-in tariffs granted in relation to all its PV
plants with nominal power above 200 kW, irrespective of the GSE Conventions’ prohibition
on unilateral termination or amendments and thus in breach of its acquired rights and

legitimate expectations.

The Claimant submits that the “outright cut” choice under the Spalma Incentivi Decree

applied to its PV plants imposing a 6% to 8% feed-in tariff reduction proportionate to the

RLA-16), 305.

plants’ capacity. The Claimant adds that Article 26 of Conversion Law No. 116//2014 also
changed the monthly payment modality from 100% to 90% of estimated annual electricity

production providing for payment of the 10% difference by 30 June of the following year.°?”

Moreover, the Claimant relies on Article 13 of the GSE Conventions, arguing that they
provided for annual automatic renewal of minimum prices covering operating costs of PV
plants in light of AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007. Destinazione Italia Decree’s repealing
minimum prices and fixing prices as equal to hourly zonal prices for Belenergia’s plants on

23 December 2013 breached Belenergia’s legitimate expectations.

Conversely, Italy rejects that Italian legislation or the GSE Conventions could have given
rise to legitimate expectations. First, Italy sustains that the Italian Constitutional Court has
confirmed in Decision No. 10795/2017 that the GSE Conventions are accessory contracts
and thus instruments of regulation concluded by the GSE as public administration exercising
public powers. Hence, Italy argues that there is no breach of commitment through the
Spalma Incentivi Decree reducing the feed-in tariffs through regulatory changes, limited to
future payment of future tariffs, and that the Spalma Incentivi Decree did not affect past
tariffs granted in relation to energy already provided. Neither did the
Destinazione Italia Decree breach alleged commitments on minimum prices, because these
had a one-year duration pursuant to AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007 and were limited only
to the first 2 million kWh withdrawn. Italy explains that the Destinazione Italia Decree
sought to prevent that PV plants exceeding 100kWh cumulate two incentives, that is,
minimum prices in addition to feed-in tariffs. Second, Italy denies that the regulatory scheme
before the Spalma Incentivi Decree and the Destinazione Italia Decree could have given rise
to legitimate expectations because it was clear from the Italian regulatory framework that

subsidy reduction was to be expected in the PV sector.

The Tribunal finds that Belenergia could not have derived legitimate expectations from
purported commitments granted under the GSE Conventions on feed-in tariffs. Belenergia
accepted at the Hearing that the feed-in tariffs were first communicated to each of its SPVs

by a GSE letter, which was later included in the GSE Conventions.°?® Further, the Italian

Constitutional Court found in Decision No. 10795/2017”? that the GSE as part of Public
Administration has acted in a position of supremacy exercising public powers when
concluding and modifying the GSE Conventions in light of Italian regulatory and legislative
framework, leading to jurisdiction of Italian administrative courts to discuss this. Hence, the
Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant that the GSE Conventions could have contained
specific commitments addressed specifically to Belenergia. As Mr. Lévy stated at the
Hearing in answer to Counsel for Respondent’s question on whether Belenergia invested in
Casamassima Solare SRL’s plants before obtaining the GSE Convention in relation to its
PV plants:

MR LEVY: [...] we had not the contract because, as you said, so the

contracts came afterwards. But the contracts are standards, contracts

that were proposed before that were part of the Conto Energia, so we
knew exactly what we would get.?*°

580. Neither does the Tribunal agree that the contractual 20-year term originally applying to feed-

in tariffs or the prohibition on unilateral changes could be considered a stabilization clause.
The subsidy (feed-in tariff) (1) amount and (2) duration components under the GSE
Conventions on feed-in tariffs were replicated from the relevant legislation including the
successive Energy Account Ministerial Decrees that automatically applied to Belenergia’s
PV plants depending on their date of start of operations as they equally applied to any other
PV plants satisfying the pre-requisites for this subsidy. These two components were set forth

in Italian legislation and were not personally addressed to Belenergia.”*! The contractual

prohibition on unilateral changes concerned the GSE and not the Italian legislator.

581. Moreover, the GSE Conventions on minimum prices were subject to a yearly duration

pursuant to Article 13,9? and minimum prices were subject to “subsequent modifications

and integrations” under Article 4 of GSE Conventions on minimum prices, as follows:

°° Italian Constitutional Court Decision No. 10795/2017 of 11 April 2017 (Exhibit REX-74).

The prices given by the GSE to the Producer for the purchasing (“per

il ritiro”) of the energy which is the subject of this Agreement are

defined in Articles 6 and 7 of the Resolution AEEG No. 280/07 and

subsequent modifications and integrations. [...}?°
Further, Article 16 on “Amendment and Renvoi” of the GSE Conventions on minimum
prices foresaw future amendments in light of “potential changes and updates” to AEEG
Resolution No. 280/07, as follows:

[...] The GSE has the discretion to modify the Agreement’s clause

according to potential changes and updates introduced [to] Resolution

AEEG 280/07, without prejudice to the possibility for the producer to

terminate this contract relationship according to Article 14.°*4
Neither can this Tribunal agree that the Italian legal and regulatory framework before the
Spalma Incentivi Decree and the Destinazione Italia Decree could have created legitimate
expectations in relation to the subsidies feed-in tariffs and minimum prices. This Tribunal
refers to the findings in Electrabel v. Hungary assessing “the amount of information that the

»°935 When

investor knew and should reasonably have known at the time of the investment’
deciding on whether an investor’s expectations are legitimate to conclude that Belenergia

could not have expected that the Italian PV regulatory framework would not change.

Like the Jsolux* tribunal, this Tribunal does not require a full and extensive due diligence
by the investor. Rather, the Tribunal has considered whether Belenergia’s alleged
expectations are reasonable considering the information that a “prudent” investor had to
know about Italian PV regulatory framework at the time of the investment. In other words,
an investor cannot legitimately expect that the legal and regulatory framework will not
change when any prudent investor could have anticipated this change before making its

investment.

585. Belenergia has presented due diligence reports only in relation to the SPVs Compagnia

a preliminary due diligence report in relation to Puglia Energia SRL.*’ Belenergia has failed
to show that these due diligence reports examined Italian regulatory risks in relation to the
feed-in tariffs and minimum prices. Belenergia has not submitted any other due diligence

documents in relation to the other 6 SPVs.

586. Mr Lévy’s testimony is unclear about whether Belenergia expressly requested a “regulatory”
due diligence. At the Hearing, when answering a question by Counsel for Respondent on
whether Belenergia considered the Spanish 2010 regulatory changes in the PV sector,
Mr Lévy stated that he did not believe that Italy could change its PV incentives regime at the

time of investment:

[Counsel for Respondent]. [...] Were you aware of the changes made
by Spain in 2010 to the legislation relating to the incentives for the
photovoltaic plants that had changed the conditions initially envisaged?

MR LEVY: Yes, but I was explaining that Spain and Italy were very
different and I looked personally into the reason why Spain did the
change, and why we estimated that for Italy it will be impossible. [...]

[Counsel for Respondent]: Despite all these facts, have you ever asked
for regulatory due diligence?

MR LEVY: I don’t think if I asked regulatory due diligence the regulator
would have answered, but I can tell you what I did, I looked at the
balance sheet of GSE and I looked at the balance sheet in Spain. [...]

[Counsel for Respondent]: Jf you had asked for a regulatory due
diligence, we should assume that the law firms did not include any
reference to the possible regulatory risk.

MR LEVY: I think I’ve done—we are careful investors, and we ask
relevant lawyers to provide us their legal due diligence. At the time in
Italy all people were just short-sighted, and this question of changing
the laws was not ever considered. Now if you ask a lawyer— at the time
I cannot—I mean in the regulatory reports there was nothing on it. But

Article 1 of the same Ministerial Decree set forth the indicative national target of 23,000MW,

fixing a cap on cumulated annual incentives costs between € 6 billion to € 7 billion.

590. Annex 5 of the same Decree setting up Energy Account IV contained different tables with
tariffs of decreasing value starting in 2011 up to 2016. For example, the same PV plant,
which was awarded 0,263 €/kWh as a feed-in tariff if it had come into operation in
August 2011, would have received only 0,155 €/kWh if it had come into operation in
August 2012, which represents a 41% incentive reduction within one year. Further, Table 5
in the same Annex 5 included reductions ranging from 9% to 30% for start of operations
between 2013 and 2016. All Belenergia’s SPVs Casamassima Solare SRL, Compagnia
Solare 1 SRL, Compagnia Solare 2 SRL, Compagnia Solare 3 SRL, and Puglia Energia SRL
acquired in September 2011 possessed plants starting operations between June and

August 2011 and thus benefiting from Energy Account IV incentives.

Belenergia invested at a very late stage when new incentives were subject to reduction and
annual cost caps set by the Italian legislator were being reached. The Preamble of Ministerial
Decree of 5 July 2012 on Energy Account V expressly indicated that by March 2012 the
cumulated annual cost of PV incentives reached € 5.6 billion, close to the cost cap set forth
in the previous Ministerial Decree on Energy Account IV. Article 1(5) of the same Decree
capped at € 6.7 billion the cumulated annual cost of PV incentives, as follows:

This Decree shall cease to apply, in any case, after thirty calendar days

from the date of the achievement of cumulative indicative cost equal to

6.7 billion of euro[s] each year. The date of the achievement of the

aforementioned value of 6.7 billion of euro[s] each year shall be

communicate[d], based on the elements provided by the GSE, [by] the

Authority for the Electric Energy and Gas, with the procedures

mentioned in Paragraph 2.

592. Hence, the original annual cost cap stipulated between € 6 and 7 billion under Energy

Account IV was reduced to a € 6.7 billion cap under Energy Account V. Just one year after
its adoption, on 6 July 2013, Energy Account V reached its € 6.7 billion cost cap and thus

stopped applying to new plants.”4*

593. Belenergia’s third investment wave took place in December 2013 after Energy Account V
ceased to apply to new plants, with Belenergia’s acquisition of Solar Solution Puglia SRL”?
Although Solar Solution Puglia SRL’s plants were entitled to tariffs under Energy Account
IV, the Tribunal highlights that this third and last wave of investment took place when no

Energy Account could possibly apply to new plants.

594. The 6% to 8% reduction to feed-in tariffs adopted in the Spalma Incentivi Decree?’ of
24 June 2014 as amended by Conversion Law No. 116/2014 applying to all PV plants with
a nominal power above 200KW is not surprising in light of Italy’s previous significant
reductions of incentives to new plants entering into operation before Belenergia first invested

in Italy in September 2011. The Tribunal considers that a 6% to 8% reduction could not

have breached Belenergia’s legitimate expectations irrespective of the GSE Conventions on

feed-in tariffs already concluded.

595. The Tribunal acknowledges that the 20-year duration of incentives was founded on Italian
legislation such as Article 12(2)”>! of Ministerial Decree of 5 July 2012 on Energy Account
IV. The Tribunal is also aware that reaching the annual cost cap under Energy Account V
did not affect rights of PV plant owners acquired before the cap had been reached.?*
Nevertheless, the evolution of the Italian incentives scheme speaks against Belenergia’s
alleged expectations that Italy cannot legitimately apply a modest 6% to 8% reduction to a
subsidy (feed-in tariff) paid in addition to the energy price applicable for 20 years of a PV

plant’s estimated life.

596. The Tribunal also considers that a “prudent” investor would have taken into account other
European PV incentives schemes. Italian incentives were higher than in other European
countries like France and Germany, although solar irradiation in Italy is higher than in

Germany and France:?**

951 Exhibit C-RFA-II-14.4 (Hearing Bundle, vol. 2, Tab 20), Article 12(2): “The incentive tariff is recognized for a
period of twenty years starting from the date of the plant coming into operation and is constant in currency for the
whole incentive period.” In relation to Energy Accounts II and III, see also Ministerial Decree of 19 February 2007,
Exhibit C-RFA-II-14.2 (Hearing Bundle, vol. 2, Tab 18), Article 6(1); Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010, Exhibit
C-RFA. 3 (Hearing Bundle, vol. 2, Tab 19), Article 8(4).

°% See Exhibit C-RFA-II-14.5 (Hearing Bundle, vol. 2, Tab 21), Article 20(1): “Starting from the date indicated in
Article 1, Paragraph 5, the present Decree and the di. of the previous incentives measures of the 5 lt
source that contributed to increase the cumulative costs reaches at the mentioned date, shall cease to apply. The
rights acquired up to the mentioned date are saved.”

As already pointed out in J 586, Mr Lévy, Belenergia’s CEO, declared at the Hearing that he

considered that changes to Italian incentives were “impossible,” in response to a question by
Counsel for Respondent in relation to the 2010 changes to the Spanish regime.** The

Tribunal finds that this was not “prudent.”

Contrary to the Claimant’s suggestion, it is irrelevant that the GSE Conventions did not
contain a force majeure or hardship clause because supervening circumstances justified by

the public interest imply a legitimate limitation on the sanctity of contracts.

Neither does the Tribunal find it “prudent” that the investor did not expect that cumulating
minimum prices and feed-in tariffs could be subject to later derogation by
Destinazione Italia Decree. The Claimant challenges the Destinazione Italia Decree fixing
minimum prices at hourly zonal prices, derogating minimum prices of € 38.5/MWh for 2014,
as updated in light of Istat data and limited to the first 1.5 million kWh annually withdrawn
from PV plants, pursuant to AEEG Resolution No. 618/2013.°°° The Tribunal considers,

however, that the average hourly zonal prices have often exceeded the former minimum

Thus, the Tribunal cannot but agree with Italy that a “prudent” investor should have predicted
Italy’s reduction of feed-in tariffs and derogation of the possibility to combine two incentives

(feed-in tariffs with minimum prices).

Substantive impropriety

In relation to the Claimant’s allegation of substantive impropriety of the
Spalma Incentivi Decree, the Tribunal has taken into account the Parties’ disagreement in
relation to the estimates of solar irradiation allegedly relied on by Italy at the outset of the
Energy Account scheme and the solar irradiation estimates allegedly considered by

Belenergia at the time of investment. The testimony of Mr Lévy confirms that Belenergia’s

°56 GRIF’s Power Point Presentation of 27 March 2018, Slide 26.

°57 See cl:

production predictions based on the PVSYST database®*’ were accurate in relation to actual
production of the invested plants, as follows:
[Counsel for Claimant]: And the [production data] predictions that you

obtained before and after investment, have they been accurate or not
accurate?

MR LEVY: Yes, they have been accurate. In some circumstances some

plants were worse than what we were expecting; others a bit better, but

on average it’s [...] rather fair. It’s a rather fair estimate. Which is

kind of logical because we knew what we would have, and we had done

also—I trust models but I also trust—I think here the same, what is done

in the neighbouring plants before you invest. So I’m not surprised at

J per cent less, 1 per cent more, we would do better or worse in different

plants or it was about the same. There are years that are better. 2017

was an excellent year. 2016 was not a good year. 2015 was a good

year. It seems to be that every two years is good, every two years is bad

but on average, yes, it’s about what we anticipated. On this particular

aspect we were rather satisfied with our forecast.*
Even if Belenergia relied on PVSYST solar irradiation estimates providing for production
predictions closer to actual solar irradiation, solar irradiation has increased in Europe in the
last years. The evidence shows that the Italian regulator might have underestimated solar
irradiation and thus overestimated the subsidy enshrined in the feed-in tariffs. The testimony
of Dr Boucher confirms that the PVGIS-3 database, relied on by Italy, was “a very old
database [...] the best you had in the 1990s” and that by the years 2000 this database “was
sort of reliable in some sense, but there were other databases that were probably as reliable
and which could be looked at.” °°? His testimony also confirms that the PVGIS database was
“developed by the [European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC)] to support policy of

the European Union in terms of solar energy.”°

The testimony of Italy’s experts attested that the Italian legislator relied on the PVGIS-3
database and later on PVGIS-CMSAF database. A simple calculation of the difference
between PVGIS-3 and PVGIS-CMSAF shows an 8.7% production prediction

 

ication by Dr Juan Camilo Rodriguez that Belenergia relied on the PVSYST database and not on the

PVGIS database: Tr. 28 March 2018, Dr Rodriguez, 441:10.

underestimation.**! According to Eng. Quaglione (GRIF), Italy adopted the conservative

estimates of the PVGIS-3 database thus overestimating the subsidy, although Italy has in

average higher irradiation levels than other European countries:

As you can see, the Italian tariffs are quite a bit higher than the other
tariffs, notwithstanding of course the quantity of electricity produced in
Italy is probably higher than the quantity of electricity produced in
Germany since the solar irradiation is, of course, higher in Italy. So
this means that Italy has adopted an approach which is very
conservative.

Notwithstanding the higher level of solar irradiation compared to other
countries Italy has chosen to set very high incentive tariffs which,
multiplied by a very high quantity of electricity produced, they sum up
to a very high revenue incentive given to the firms.

Why has this happened? Because Italy has relied on the (very well
known now) PVGIS database, which is a database, as we know, issued
by the Joint Research Centre and has been conceived in order to support
the policy intervention in Europe about energy sources and energy
policies, of course.

As you may see in bold in the middle point, “The JRC is a Directorate-
General of the European Commission under the responsibility of Tibor
Navracsics, Commissioner for Education [and so on]. It is spread
across six sites in five different countries within the EU”. [Slide 10]

So the PVGIS is an independent third-party database which is
characterised by the fact that solar irradiation measurements included
in the first version of the database were particularly conservative, let's

say

604. The Tribunal finds that underestimated production predictions could justify a subsidy
reduction of 6% to 8% like the one of the Spalma Incentivi Decree.” In any event, the
Claimant’s PV plants actual production levels of 32,861,143 kWh exceed by 171,830 kWh
Italy’s production data of 32,689,313 kWh founded on the newer, more precise PVGIS-

°6! GRIF’s Power Point Presentation of 27 March 2018, Slide 16: If total production prediction pursuant to PVGIS-3
is 30,071,851 kWh, total production prediction of 32,689,313 kWh pursuant to PVGIS-CMSAF is 8.7% higher
(equivalent to the difference of 2,617,462 kWh between these two databases).

CMSAF database.” Hence, Belenergia could not have legitimately expected that
overestimated subsidies funded by Italy’s taxpayers could remain intact for 20 years because
Italy’s original incentives had been based on underestimated energy production predictions.
Whether Belenergia was aware that Italy relied on an old prediction database when fixing

feed-in tariffs is irrelevant.

Moreover, the Tribunal rejects Belenergia’s argument that the 6-8% reduction in feed-in
tariffs has not benefited SMEs. First of all, Belenergia has not adduced convincing evidence
in this respect. And, in any event, other reasons for feed-in tariffs’ reduction such as
underestimated production predictions, lower PV technology costs and burdens on Italian
tax payers and electricity consumers suffice for the Tribunal to consider the

Spalma Incentivi Decree as reasonable, justifiable and proportionate.

Therefore, the Tribunal rejects Belenergia’s allegation of substantive impropriety of
reducing feed-in tariffs because this change was reasonable, justifiable and proportionate to

Italy’s policies in the PV sector.

Procedural impropriety

Belenergia argues that Italy’s adoption of the Spalma Incentivi Decree did not observe
legislative processes, breaching transparency and due process requirements, and, in
particular, failing to comply with (a) the Directive of the President of the Council of

Ministers of 16 January 2013°°

establishing the rules on the Regulatory Impact Analysis
(“Analisi di impatto della regolamentazione” or RIA) and (b) the Directive of the President
of the Council of Ministers of 10 September 2008 setting forth the rules on the Technical

Regulatory Analysis (“Analisi tecnico-normativa” or TRA).

The Tribunal is not convinced that this is the case. The Claimant has introduced a report
(Exhibit C-10RM) dated of 11 July 2014 and issued by the Legal and Legislative Affairs

Department of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, which contains the RIA and the

94 GRIF’s Power Point Presentation of 27 March 2018, Slide 16. See also First GRIF Report, pp. 35-36 (Table 2.

TRA concerning the bill of conversion into law of the Spalma Incentivi Decree of
24 June 2014. This report is dated of one month before the enactment of Conversion Law
No. 116 on 11 August 2014. The Claimant has not presented sufficient evidence that the
RIA and the TRA contained in this report do not satisfy the formalities under Italian law.
The Claimant has alleged that the document “contains nothing on the TRA”®®’ but did not

translate the section that covers the TRA in the document, except for the section’s title.°°*

The Tribunal further considers that the standard for a finding of procedural impropriety is a
high one under the FET. Belenergia has not adduced evidence showing a serious due process

breach in Italy’s legislative process that could justify an FET breach under the ECT.

Finally, the Tribunal differs with Belenergia that the feed-in tariffs’ reduction contained in
the Spalma Incentivi Decree “came out of nowhere.” The Tribunal’s regulatory and
legislative review of Italian law above shows that PV investors should have expected

reductions in PV incentives in light of previous reductions.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Belenergia’s FET claim under

Article 10(1) ECT.

(2) Has Italy Breached the Umbrella Clause under Article 10(1) ECT?

As the Tribunal has held in {J 352-358 above that it has jurisdiction over the umbrella clause
claim and that it is admissible, the Tribunal will now decide on whether Italy breached the

umbrella clause under Article 10(1) ECT, on which the Parties disagree.

Irrespective of the “contractual” character of the GSE Conventions, the Claimant argues that
they constitute commitments undertaken by Italy falling within the meaning of the umbrella

clause under Article 10(1) ECT. The Respondent disagrees.

967 Claimant’s Reply, {| 304.

968 See Report dated 11 July 2014 of the Legal and Legislative Affairs Department of the Presidency of the Council
of Ministers with the RIA and the TRA concerning the bill of conversion into law of the Spalma Incentivi Decree of
24 June 2014 (Exhibit C-10RM), p. 2 of TRA (p. 48 of the pdf): “II provvedimento normative, in tema di sviluppo
economico, reca interventi orientati prioritariamente alle piccole e medie imprese, prevedendo in particolare incentivi
fiscali agli investimenti produttivi, interventi relativi alia capitalizzazione d’azienda e alia riduzione di alcune
componenti delle tariffe elettriche. La crescita economica e infatti un obiettivo prioritario per il Governo anche in

relazione all’esigenza di rilanciare la competiti

 

i delle imprese italiane nel mercato nazionale e interazionale e

accompagnare il superamento della congiuntura economica negativa degli ultimi anni.”

224

614. Article 10(1) ECT provides in its last sentence that “[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe
any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any
other Contracting Party.” Pursuant to this provision, Belenergia has to demonstrate that

Italy has breached an obligation “entered into with” Belenergia.

615. As stated in J] 579-580 above, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant that the GSE

Conventions on feed-in tariffs contained specific commitments addressed specifically to or
entered into with Belenergia because the feed-in tariffs were firstly communicated to each
of its SPVs by a GSE letter, which was later automatically included in the GSE
Conventions.» The feed-in tariffs amount and duration included in the GSE Conventions
were set forth in Italian legislation and were not personally addressed to Belenergia, but
replicated from the relevant legislation including the successive Energy Account Ministerial
Decrees that automatically applied to Belenergia’s PV plants depending on their date of start
of operations as they equally applied to any other PV plants satisfying the pre-requisites for
this subsidy. This means that Belenergia could have invested in PV plants (as it did) even

before obtaining the GSE Convention.?”

616. Neither did the GSE Conventions on minimum prices contain specific commitments
specifically addressed to or entered into with Belenergia. As stated in {J 581-582 above, the

GSE Conventions on minimum prices also replicated minimum prices set forth in Italian

3071

legislation, subject to a yearly duration pursuant to their Article 1 and to “subsequent

modifications and integrations” under Article 4 of each GSE Convention on minimum
prices."’? Not to mention that Article 16 of the same Conventions foresaw future

amendments in light of “potential changes and updates” to AEEG Resolution No. 280/07.9*

617. Moreover, as stated by the /solux tribunal, a regulation equally addressed to national and
foreign investors cannot, because of its general character, create obligations only in relation

to national investors, as follows:

The Arbitral Tribunal accepts that, in special cases, the laws and
administrative acts may contain commitments, in particular when they
are specifically addressed to foreign investors, as indicated in the
award in Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v.
Kazakhstan. The obligation to arbitrate provided in various
investments codes is a typical example. Yet, a rule addressing national
and foreign investors cannot, because of its general character, create
only obligations only vis-a-vis the former, including when they are
investors of a Contracting Party.°”

 

 

618. The Italian legal and regulatory framework before the Spalma Incentivi Decree and the
Destinazione Italia Decree was clearly addressed to national and foreign investors and thus

could not be interpreted as creating obligations specifically “entered into with” Belenergia.
619. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Belenergia’s umbrella clause claim under

Article 10(1) ECT.

(3) Has Italy Breached the Most Constant Protection and Security Obligation under
Article 10(1) ECT?

620. The Parties disagree on whether the obligation of most constant protection and security under
Article 10(1) ECT extends beyond a mere obligation to provide “physical” protection and

security, including stability, physical, commercial and legal security, and legal protection.°”°

6:

N

1. Article 10(1) ECT provides that Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties “shall
also enjoy the most constant protection and security.” While the Tribunal agrees with the
Claimant that this standard may extend beyond the protection of physical security in certain
situations, the Tribunal does not find that this standard could protect investments against the
State’s right to legislate or regulate in a manner that negatively affects them. The AES
Summit v. Hungary tribunal also found that the most constant protection and security under

the ECT does not protect against the State’s legislative and regulatory activity:

°6 AES Summit Generation Limited et al.

In the Tribunal’s view, the duty to provide most constant protection and

security to investments is a state’s obligation to take reasonable steps

to protect its investors (or to enable its investors to protect themselves)

against harassment by third parties and/or state actors. But the

standard is certainly not one of strict liability. And while it can, in

appropriate circumstances, extend beyond a protection of physical

security it certainly does not protect against a state’s right (as was the

case here) to legislate or regulate in a manner which may negatively

affect a claimant’s investment, provided that the state acts reasonably

in the circumstances and with a view to achieving objectively rational

public policy goals.°”°
Italy’s legislative activity by way of the SpalmaIncentivi Decree and the
Destinazione Italia Decree cannot qualify as a breach of the obligation of most constant
protection and security under Article 10(1) ECT even if it negatively affects national and

other foreign investments such as Belenergia’s.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Belenergia’s most constant protection and

security claim under Article 10(1) ECT.

(4) Has Italy Breached the Provisions Prohibiting Unreasonable and
Discriminatory Measures under Articles 10(1), (2) and (3) ECT?
The Claimant argues that Italy breached its obligation not to impair Belenergia’s investment
by unreasonable and discriminatory measures under Article 10(1) ECT and not to
discriminate against Belenergia pursuant to Article 10(2) and (3) ECT. Italy objects to the
Claimant’s position, arguing, among others, that the claim on unreasonable and
discriminatory measures overlaps with the FET claim, and that Article 10(2) and (3) ECT

only apply to the “Making of Investments” as defined in Article 1(8) ECT.
Article 10(1), (2) and (3) of the ECT provide, in the relevant part, as follows:

(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to

impair by unreasonable or discrimi ry measures their

maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such
Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required
by international law, including treaty obligations. [...]

(2) Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to accord to Investors of
other Contracting Parties, as regards the Making of Investments in its
Area, the Treatment described in paragraph (3).

(3) For the purposes of this Article, “Treatment” means treatment
accorded by a Contracting Party which is no less favourable than that

Contracting Party or any third state, whichever is the most favourable.

The Tribunal will first consider Italy’s objection to the application of Article 10(2) and (3)
ECT. The Tribunal agrees with Italy that an interpretation in light of the ordinary meaning
of these treaty provisions indicates that they concern only the “Making of Investments.”
First, the use of the expression “Treatment” is capitalized in paragraph (2) but not in
paragraph (1), which indicates that the definition of “Treatment” as capitalised in paragraph
(3) should be limited to “Treatment” related to the “Making of Investments,” referred to in

paragraph (2) of Article 10 ECT.

Second, Article 1(8) ECT defines the “Making of Investments” as establishing or acquiring
new or additional investments, as follows:
(8) “Make Investments” or “Making of Investments” means

establishing new Investments, acquiring all or part of existing
Investments or moving into different fields of Investment activity.

Belenergia has not satisfied its burden of proving that the alleged discriminatory character
of the measures affect the establishment or acquisition of new or additional investments in

the PV sector. Therefore, Belenergia’s claim under Article 10(2) and (3) ECT cannot stand.

The Tribunal now turns to the claim based on the prohibition of unreasonable and

discriminatory measures under Article 10(1) ECT in relation to existing investments.

First, the Tribunal has already stated in {{[ 602-610 above that the changes to Italy’s

regulatory and legislative framework were neither unreasonable nor disproportionate, let

alone unpredictable. As to Belenergia’s argument that Italy’s measures lack public interest

9977

goals such as environment or public health protection, and a “rational policy, it suffices

for the Tribunal that the true purpose of the measures was to reduce the cost of subsidies.

Second, Belenergia’s position that the regulatory differentiation linking the reduction of
feed-in tariffs to the nominal capacity of PV plants discriminates against medium and big
PV plants (like those of Belenergia and of major foreign investors)””* cannot prevail. Italy’s
differentiation between smaller plants, on the one hand, and medium and big power plants
with nominal capacity in excess of 200kW, on the other, is not discriminatory because it is
based on objective and legitimate grounds. This differentiated treatment is by no means
based on the national or foreign origin of producers, but on their capacity, size, economic
and commercial dimension. Thus, differentiated treatment based on legitimate grounds
leading to special protection of smaller plants is easily justifiable so far as it seeks to

guarantee free competition in the energy sector.

Likewise, differentiated scales applying to minimum prices based on production capacity is
objectively justified because production capacity affects the calculation of operational costs,
an objective base for the estimation of minimum prices. Moreover, the Claimant has not
argued or demonstrated that such an objective differentiated treatment could lead to a

subjective differentiated treatment and thus to concealed discrimination.

Third, Article 22bis of Law No. 164/2014°” of 11 November 2014 excludes from the

 

application of Article 26 of Conversion Law No. 116/2014°*° certain Italian public entities
and schools (“enti locali o scuole’’) operating in the PV sector. Belenergia argues that this
legislation is discriminatory as these entities are competitors vis-a-vis Belenergia.*! The
Tribunal does not see how these entities could qualify as “competitors” to Belenergia, since

they are not profit-making enterprises, and Belenergia has failed to demonstrate this.

Differentiated treatment based on the special characteristics of these entities is easily justified

in the energy sector’s regulation.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Belenergia’s claim on unreasonable and

discriminatory measures under Articles 10(1), (2) and (3) ECT.

KK

Summing up, the Tribunal dismisses all Belenergia’s claims on the merits, finding that Italy
has not breached (/) the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT; (2) the umbrella clause
under Article 10(1) ECT; (3) the most constant protection and security obligation under
Article 10(1) ECT; let alone (4) the provisions prohibiting unreasonable and discriminatory
measures under Articles 10(1), (2) and (3) ECT. Consequently, no damages have to be

assessed.

C. The Tribunal’s Decision

641. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention addresses assessment and allocation of the costs of

an ICSID arbitration, as follows:

 

642. Article 61(2) refers to three arbitration cost components: expenses incurred by the parties,

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom
those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal
and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.
Such decision shall form part of the award.

fees and expenses of the Tribunal members, and ICSID’s own charges. The same provision

also provides for the Tribunal’s wide discretion to allocate the arbitration costs between the

Parties as it deems appropriate.

°87 Statement of Defense, ‘| 649(m); Respondent's Rejoinder,  415(m).
°88 Respondent’s Statement of Costs of 22 June 2018.

°89 Pursuant to the Secretariat’s Interim Financial Statement dated 10 July 2019, the accurate amount deposited by

Italy as advance payments is US$ 343,876.83.

232

643. Rule 28(2) of the ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings then provides:

Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to
the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in
the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal
an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all
costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may,
before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the
Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the
cost of the proceeding.

644. As required by Rule 28(2), the Parties submitted statements of their claimed costs in
June 2018. In its cost submission, the Claimant sought a total of € 1,954,689.86 in respect
of legal, translation, witness and experts’ fees and disbursements and payments to ICSID.
For its corresponding expenses, the Respondent sought € 361,603.00 in legal fees and
disbursements plus US$ 100,000.00 in payments to ICSID. The Secretariat’s Interim
Financial Statement dated 10 July 2019 circulated to the Tribunal states that the Claimant

had advanced US$ 349,960.00 and the Respondent US$ 343,876.83, in total.
645. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s
administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):°”°
Arbitrators’ fees and expenses
Yves Derains (President) US$ 176,681.25

Bernard Hanotiau (Co-arbitrator) USS 81,414.80
José Carlos Fernandez Rozas (Co- USS 136,681.15

arbitrator)
ICSID’s administrative fees USS 148,000
Direct expenses (estimated)! US$ 109,476.90
Total US$ 652,254.10

°© The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all
invoices are received and the account is final.

°°! This amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).

233

646. The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.””? As

a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to US$ 326,127.05.

647. The Tribunal is mindful that some ICSID tribunals have adopted the practice of awarding to
the prevailing party some or all of its costs. However, in the circumstances of this case, the
Tribunal finds that it is appropriate for each Party to bear its own costs. This arbitration
involved a number of challenging procedural and legal issues, which both Parties addressed
with professional advocacy. While the Claimant has mostly prevailed on jurisdiction and
admissibility, the Tribunal has dismissed all of its claims on the merits. Accordingly, the
Tribunal concludes that it is fair for each Party to bear its own legal and other expenses and
its respective equal share of “the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the

charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.”

VII. AWARD

648. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(i) DECLARES that it has jurisdiction over Belenergia’s claims except for its claim regarding

imbalance costs and that Belenergia’s claims are admissible;
(ii) DECLINES jurisdiction over Belenergia’s imbalance costs claim;

(iii) DISMISSES Belenergia’s claims on the alleged breaches of Articles 10(1), (2) and (3) of
the ECT;

(iv) ORDERS the Parties to bear the arbitration costs in equal shares;
(v) ORDERS each Party to bear their own legal costs and expenses;

(vi)DISMISSES all other claims brought by the Parties in this arbitration.

°®? The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.
