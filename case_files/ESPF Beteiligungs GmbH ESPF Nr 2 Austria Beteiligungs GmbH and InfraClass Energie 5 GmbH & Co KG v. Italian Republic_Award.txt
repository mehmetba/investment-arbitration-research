2013 Circular A circular issued by Italy’s tax authorities in December

2013, in which the Respondent reclassified PV plants as
immovable property, which: (i) lowered the depreciation
rate for PV plants from 9% to 4% per year, thereby
resulting in higher taxable income of PV plant owners; (ii)
made the Claimants’ PV facilities subject to IMU
Charges, which the local municipality charges on
buildings; and (iii) made the Claimants’ PV facilities
subject to TASI Charges, to cover municipal services such
as road maintenance and public lighting

 

2016 Budget Law Law No. 208/2015, 28 December 2015: as of 1 January
2016, the value of certain types of immovable property was
to be calculated based on the ground, building and
structural elements of the building, without including the
value of certain movable elements such as “machinery,
devices, equipment and other facilities used in the specific
industrial process,” thereby reducing the portion of PV
facilities that had been deemed to be immovable property

INTRODUCTION

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty, which entered
into force on 16 April 19981 (the “ECT” or “Treaty”), and the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which

entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The dispute relates to the Claimants’ investments in Italy’s renewable energy sector and
arises from the legislative, regulatory and contractual measures implemented by Italy as of
2005 in order to encourage investments in the solar energy industry. The Claimants allege
that the government has caused damages in the Claimants’ portfolios in photovoltaic
(“PV”) technology projects through regulatory changes. In particular, the Claimants allege
that by implementing a series of legislative and regulatory changes and through court
decisions, the Respondent substantially reduced fixed incentive tariffs and minimum
guaranteed prices intended to attract and support investment in PV facilities, upon which
they relied in making their investments in Italy. The Claimants argue that the measures at
issue in these proceedings amount to a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT and international

law.

The Respondent alleges that the incentives offered by the government were not guaranteed
to remain unchanged, that the measures in question fall within its right to regulate and were
reasonable and proportional. According to the Respondent, none of the measures
challenged by the Claimants breach the ECT or international law. The Respondent raised
a number of objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (addressed in detail in

Sections VII — IX of the Award).
THE PARTIES

The Claimants are ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH (“SPF”), an institutional fund incorporated

under the laws of Germany and a subsidiary of European Solar Power Fund Nr. 1 GmbH

The Respondent is the Italian Republic (“Italy” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

The Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS

On 18 June 2014 and 4 March 2015, respectively, the Claimants sent two letters to the
Respondent, stating their intention to commence arbitral proceedings under the ECT and
offering an amicable settlement of the dispute (the “Amicable Settlement Letters”).>

The Respondent did not reply to these letters.

On 29 January 2016, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration from the Claimants against
Italy (the “Request”), pursuant to the ECT and the ICSID Convention.

On 8 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration.
Inthe notice of registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to
constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID

Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID

Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed

two co-arbitrators.

On 26 July 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the Parties
that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date. The Tribunal is composed of Mr. Henri C.
Alvarez, a national of Canada, President, appointed by his co-arbitrators in consultation
with the Parties; Dr. Michael C. Pryles, a national of Australia, appointed by the Claimants;
and Professor Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, a national of France and Switzerland,
appointed by the Respondent. Ms. Mairée Uran-Bidegain was designated to serve as

Secretary of the Tribunal.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 20 October 2016 by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 31 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. | recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order
No. 1 provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect
from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and set out, in

Annex A, a schedule for the written and oral phases of the proceedings.

On 17 January 2017, ICSID received an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-
Disputing Party in these proceedings dated 16 January 2017, from the European
Commission (the “EC”), together with accompanying documentation (the “NDP

Application”).

On 22 February 2017, the Claimants submitted their response to the Preliminary Request.

On 28 February 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 in which it determined
that both the Preliminary Request and the Application were premature since Italy had not
yet submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits or any Memorial on Jurisdiction.
Accordingly, it deferred further consideration of the EC’s NDP Application until the
Respondent had submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and any Memorial on
Jurisdiction. A detailed recount of the procedural steps leading to the Tribunal’s Procedural

Order No. 2 is included in Section I of that order.

On 9 June 2017, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial (“Respondent’s
Counter-Memorial”) which contained, apart from its position on the merits, the

Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction, and a request for bifurcation of the proceedings

in Section I of that Order.

On 22 August 2017, having received the Counter-Memorial, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 4, deciding on the NDP Application from the EC. In its Order the
Tribunal (a) denied the EC’s request for leave to present its views at an oral hearing; (b)
granted the EC leave to submit by 30 September 2017 a “single written submission
addressing questions of European Law and the relationship between the ECT and European
Law, not to exceed 25 pages in length with 1.5 line spacing;”6 and (c) “direct[ed] the
Parties to consult and agree on the case materials to be disclosed to the EC for the purpose

of making the submission.”

On 4 and 5 September 2017, the Parties notified the Centre that they had agreed to release
Exhibits C-002 to C-004, R-022, and R-032 to the EC. On 7 September 2017, the Centre
notified the Parties that, apart from the documents selected by the Parties, the Tribunal
proposed transmitting to the EC a copy of the Request for Arbitration, and gave them an
opportunity to comment on this proposal by 11 September 2017. On 12 September 2017,

the Parties that the hard copies of the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial were not submitted
in accordance with Sections 13.2 and 13.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, and indicated that

[t]he lack of access to properly organized materials, impacts the Tribunal’s ability
to efficiently and effectively decide this case. Accordingly, and on an exceptional
basis, the Centre prepared for each of the Members of the Tribunal, hardcopies of
the Counter-Memorial submission ... The cost of this service will be charged
against the Respondent’s share of the advance payment ... the President of the

energy policies date back to the 1980s, although it did not begin to provide economic

support to such investments until the 1990s. '°

The EC Directives and various Italian legislative decrees from 1996 to 2003 indicate that
the promotion and support of the renewable energy sector was a priority for the EU

generally, and for Italy in particular. Historical highlights include:

e 1991: Italy implemented its first program to support renewable energy facilities

through a feed-in-tariff (“FIT”) program through Law No. 9.!!

e 1992: Italy’s Inter-Ministerial Committee for Prices (“CIP”) issued its
mechanism for establishing competitive purchase prices for electricity in

Measure No. 6, which became known as the “CIP-6” program.

e 1996: EC Directive 96/92 established rules for the common electricity market
and required EU Member States to liberalize their electricity systems and

prioritize renewable energy sources. !?

e 1998: an EC report on this Directive stressed the necessity of the variety of
support schemes in existence across the EU Member States because electricity
production from renewable sources was more expensive than electricity
produced from competing fuels.'* The EC endeavoured to propose common

rules for the treatment of renewables by the end of 1998.'*

e 1998: Italy signed the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed to reduce carbon dioxide

emissions by eight percent before the end of 2012.!°

e 1998: The Italian Government committed to enact measures to encourage
greater efficiency in the use of energy and double the share of renewable energy

sources. !°

e 1999: Italy’s National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable
Economic Development (“ENEA”) issued a White Paper which pointed to the
strategic importance of renewable energy to Italy and stated that from 2008-
2012, Italy would significantly increase energy production from renewable

energy sources. !7

e 1999: Italy implemented EC Directive 96/92 (discussed above) by enacting
Legislative Decree No. 79 (“Bersani Decree”), which liberalized Italy’s
electricity market with anti-monopoly rules to transfer the generation,

distribution and sale of energy from Italy’s National Entity for Electricity

(“ENEL”) to newly incorporated companies.'* This Decree provided

renewable energy plants priority access to the grid and abolished the
requirement that producers enter into agreements with ENEL, instead requiring
them to contract with a state-owned company known as the “GRTN,”!? which,
in 2005, was renamed the “GSE.””° The GSE is a state-owned company created

74. From 2001-2009, the EU established the following binding?” renewable energy targets for
its Member States, which the Parties agree were the impetus behind the Respondent’s

incentives legislation in the solar PV sector:”>

e 2001: The European Parliament and Council enacted its first renewable energy
goal in Directive 2001/77/EC, which prescribed national targets (as opposed to
requirements) for each EU Member State for the production of electricity from
renewable sources, in view of the EU’s objective of having 22.1% of total EU
electricity consumption produced from renewable sources by 2010.”4 Italy’s
target was to have 25% of total electricity consumption produced from
renewable energy sources by 2010,”° which was then revised to a more realistic

target of 22%.76

accomplish national targets of 20% consumption from renewable energy
sources by 2020 (the “20-20-20” targets),*° but discretion was left to the
governments as to which particular sources to incentivize (hydro, solar, wind,
biomass, or other sources of renewable energy) and how to promote that
development.*! Most EU Member States, including Italy, opted for price
support tariffs: a FIT amount per kWh of production or a feed-in premium
(“FIP”) paid in addition to the wholesale price. These would be paid to

producers for a prescribed period of time set by regulation.*”

By 2012, Italy had achieved and surpassed the level of PV production it had
projected in 2010 for 2020. By 2016, it was the second largest solar PV
producer in Europe in terms of installed PV capacity.*? According to the
Respondent, the “member States have already agreed on a new renewable
energy target of at least 27% of final energy consumption in the EU as a whole

by 2030."34

Italy has a history of legislation on incentives in PV sources. In accordance with the EC

of sufficient duration to guarantee fair remuneration in light of the upfront costs

of PV plant operation.*°

Legislative Decree No. 387 gave rise to the Conto
Energia regime at issue in this case (explained below at paragraphs 76 to 120).
It set out a general framework and it instructed Italy’s relevant ministries to then
develop the specific mechanics of the incentive tariff regime. The Decree reads,

in relevant part, as follows:

Article 7 - Specific provisions for photovoltaic energy

1. Within six months from the date of entry into force of this decree, the Minister
of Productive Activities, in consultation with the Minister of Environment and
Protection of Natural Resources, in consultation with the Joint Conference, shall
adopt one or more decrees which define the criteria to encourage the production
of electricity from solar sources.

2. The criteria referred to in paragraph 1, which shall impose no new cost to the
state budget and shall be in compliance with Community legislation currently in
force, shall:

a) establish the requirements of the subjects that may benefit from incentives;

b) establish the minimum technical requirements of the eligible components
and systems;

c) establish the conditions for the accumulation of the new incentives with
other incentives;

d) establish the modalities for determining the scope of incentives. For
electricity produced by photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, provide a
specific incentive rate, decreasing amount and duration as to ensure fair
remuneration of each investment and operating costs;

e) establish a target for the nominal power to be installed;

£) agree also with the upper limit of the cumulative electric power of all plants
that can receive the incentive;

authorized in accordance with paragraph 3 below, are considered a matter of
public utility, not deferrable and of urgency.”

e 2005: Law No. 62 directed the government to implement European Directive
2003/54/EC.** With respect to the use of incentives to develop renewable

energy sources, the law provided as follows:

Article 15.

1. For the purpose of completing the liberalization process of the electricity
market, the Government has been delegated to adopt, within one year of the date
of entry into force of this law, with the modalities of which in Article 1, one or
more legislative decrees, in order to implement Directive 2003/54/EC of the
European Parliament and the Council, of June 26, 2003, concerning common rules
for the internal electric energy market and which repeals Directive 96/92/EC, and,
consequently, to redefine all the related features linked to the regulation for the
national electric system, while observing the authority of the special status regions
and of the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano in compliance with their
respective statutes and their related implementation standards and in compliance
with the following guiding principles and criteria:

£) develop the use of the new renewable energy sources and of cogeneration
by means of market instruments, foreseeing the reorganization of existing
interventions, with measures, including those of differentiated nature, by
types of power plant and introducing incentive mechanisms based on tenders

far_from being competitive, and, th ding, upon the
expiration of the current agreements, the termination, without any possibility
of extensions, of all incentives for the power plants operating using sources
that are assimilated to renewables.*”

76. Following these legislative acts, five ministerial decrees were adopted to implement
incentive tariff programs for electricity generated by PV sources (the “Conto Energia
Decrees”).*” The Conto Energia Decrees provided for incentive payments per kWh of
electricity produced by PV plants for a period of 20 years. The first four Conto Energia

Decrees provided a FIP which consisted of a payment per unit of electricity produced in

V provided an “all-inclusive tariff’ in the form of an all-inclusive FIT pursuant to which
plants received a fixed amount per unit of electricity produced. Certain other plants covered

paragraph 3.

Article 12.

Maximum limit of cumulative electricity capacity for all plants that can
obtain the tariff and priority criteria for access to the tariff

1, The incentive tariffs under this decree are awarded until cumulative nominal

capacity for all plants that obtain the same feed- in tariffs reaches a value of 100
Mw.

According to the Claimants, Conto I provided, in Articles 5.2, 6.2 and 6.3, that qualifying
PV plants had the right (“diritto”) to receive a specific incentive tariff for a period of
20 years. The incentive tariff was to be paid to the producer per KiloWatt hour (“kWh”)
of the electricity it produced, in addition to whatever sale price the producer obtained for
its electricity.*4 As provided in the Decree, incentive rates for eligible facilities after

2006 were reduced by two percent.*5

Under Conto I, and the other Conto Energia Decrees, an investor who wished to develop a
solar facility and benefit from the incentives offered was required to submit a request for
the corresponding incentive tariff together with a commitment to obtain the necessary
authorizations for the construction and operation of the plant. Requests were submitted to
the GSE which would provisionally determine eligibility for the incentive program. The
investor then had a period from six to twelve months to commence construction of the plant
and twelve to twenty-four months to complete construction and connect the facility to the
electrical grid. Failure to meet the deadlines would result in the loss of the right to the
incentive tariffs.*° If an applicant qualified, confirmation of the right to the incentive tariffs

under Conto I (and the subsequent Conto Energia Decrees) was communicated by a letter

Conto 1: C-039, Arts. 5.2, 6.2, 6.3, 8, 12. The threshold of 100MW was later extended to 500MW: see

Ministerial Decree of 6 February 2006, Art. 2.1 (bold emphasis in the original, underlined emphasis added).

Claimants’ Memorial, | 89. According to the Claimants, Conto I established the following tariff rates for

eligible plants authorized in 2005 and 2006 on the basis of the plant’s nominal capacity: €0.445/kWh for plants
between IkW and 20kW; €0.460/kWh for plants between 20kW and 50kW; and €0.490/kWh for plants between S0kW

Letter also invited the investor to log on to the GSE’s website, using the ID and password
previously assigned to the investor, to access the agreement prepared for the investor’s

return it to the GSE. The GSE would then execute the agreement (the “GSE Agreement”)

and make it available in the “agreements” section of its web portal.

81. The GSE Agreements were executed between the GSE and the local companies operating

e The specific tariff rate and duration of the incentives was confirmed in the GSE

Letters and GSE Agreements.*°

87. Conto II differed from Conto I in the following ways:
e The tariff rates were slightly lower.

e It did not contain the inflation adjustment clause (contained in Article 6 of
Conto 1) allowing Italy to increase or reduce the tariff rate in accordance with

the consumer price index for wholesale price of electricity (“CPI”).

e  Itsimplified the enrolment process by requiring Producers to request the benefit
of the incentive tariff only upon the facility’s entry into operation, which

avoided investors being granted capacity that was never realized.*’

a. Salva Alcoa Decree

93. On 13 August 2010, Italy adopted Law Decree 129 (“Salva Alcoa Decree”) in order to
address a backlog of plants waiting for connection to the grid by the Grid Operator. The
Salva Alcoa Decree permitted PV plants to secure Conto II tariffs after the original Conto
II deadline of 31 December 2010, provided that the construction of the plant was complete
and verified by the GSE by that deadline and the plant entered into operation by 30 June
2011.8! Under Conto II, once completion of construction had been verified by an
authorized technician, and verified by the Grid Manager and the GSE, the plant could be
connected to the grid and enter into operation later. Provided this had been done by
31 December 2010, the plant was entitled to receive tariffs under Conto II. The Salva Alcoa
Decree extended the time for the Grid Operator to connect the plant to the grid until 30 June

2011.

Conto III was enacted on 6 August 2010 and, as with Contos I and II, granted qualifying
PV plants the right to receive a specific incentive tariff for 20 years starting from the date

of the plant’s connection to the grid.**

Conto III reduced tariff rates on a sliding scale from €0.362/kWh to €0.251/kWh for new
PV facilities.** Conto III offered these tariffs to PV plants that entered into operation from
2011 through 2013 and stated that the MED would issue a subsequent decree.** The tariffs
were available until the aggregate installed capacity of PV plants reached 3,000 MW, with
a 14-month grace window for plants that were connected to the grid after this limit was

achieved. *°
Article 8 of Conto III provided as follows:

Art.8
Incentive Tariffs

1. The incentive tariffs under this title apply to solar photovoltaic plants entering
into operation following new construction, total revamping or repowering, after
31 December 2010.

2. Electricity produced by solar photovoltaic plants under this title and operational
by 31 December 2011, is entitled to the incentive tariff under table A. Electricity
produced by photovoltaic plants under this title entering into operation in 2012
and 2013 is entitled to the tariff under Table A, column C), decreased by 6% per

eligibility by way of a confirmation letter from the GSE and required investors to enter into
agreements with the GSE. The GSE Letters confirmed the specific tariff to which the
facility was entitled and provided that the tariff was constant, in current currency,
throughout the 20-year term. For example, the GSE Letter for ESPF 2 Piazza Armerina

plant provided, in part, as follows:

With reference to the photovoltaic plant hereunder, we hereby communicate the
admission to the incentive tariff under Ministerial Decree 6 August 2010 equal to
0.3130 euro/kWh.

The incentive tariff will be recognized for a period of 20 years as of the date of
entry into operation of the plant: 29/04/2011; the tariff is constant, in current
currency, all through the 20-year period. Such period is calculated net of a
potential shutdown of the plant due to grid stability issues or natural disasters
qualified as such by the competent authorities. *

98. The GSE Agreements were similar to those under Conto II and provided, in relevant part,

101. On 4 June 2010, Italy adopted Law No. 96, which established the guiding criteria for the
implementation of the 2009 EC Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from

renewable resources. On 3 March 2011, Italy implemented the 2009 EC Directive by way

of Legislative Decree No. 28/2011, known as the “Romani Decree.”

102. The Romani Decree contemplated, amongst other things, gradual regulatory monitoring
and controls of tariff rates to account for cost reductions in PV technology and to reduce
costs of electricity for consumers, while “protect[ing] the investments made.”*? The Decree

read, in relevant part, as follows:

Article 23 General principles
In effect starting March 29, 2011

1. This Title redefines the regulation of the support schemes applied to the energy
produced by renewable sources and to energy efficiency by means of
rearrangement and enhancement of the current incentive systems. The new
regulations establish a general framework aimed at promoting the production of
energy from renewable sources and of energy efficiency in a measure that is
appropriate to allow achievement of the objective of which in Article 3, by means
of the preparation of criteria and tools that promote the efficacy, efficiency,
simplification and stability over time of the incentive systems, pursuing, at the
same time, harmonization with other tools having analogous objectives and the
reduction of the specific support costs charged to the consumers.

2. The gradualness of the intervention to protect the investments made and the
proportionality in relation to the objectives, as well as the flexibility of the
structure of the support schemes, are further general principles of the
rearrangement and enhancement intervention of the incentive systems, having the
purpose of taking into account market mechanisms and technological evolution
of renewable power sources and of energy efficiency.

103. |The Romani Decree changed the mechanics of Conto III by limiting availability of the
Conto III tariffs to PV plants that were connected to the grid by 31 May 2011 (rather than
by 31 December 2013, as originally provided under Conto III). The Decree also required
the MED to enact a new decree establishing revised incentive tariffs for PV plants

connected to the grid after 31 May 2011.°°

(4) Conto IV

104. On 5 May 2011, as required by the Romani Decree, the MED enacted Conto IV.*° The
Decree noted that “grid parity” (when PV plants compete with other market players without
subsidy support) would be achieved in a few years, and then the incentive schemes would

no longer be necessary.*” Conto IV provided, in relevant part, as follows:

Article 1.

2. ... this Decree applies to photovoltaic plants operational at a date subsequent
to 31 May 2011 and up until 31 December 2016, with a national indicative target
of 23,000 MW, corresponding to a yearly indicative cumulative cost for the
incentives which is estimated between 6 and 7 billion euros.

o Romani Decree: C-165, Arts. 23.1, 23.2, 24.1, 24.2, 25.9, 25.10. The Decree also required the MED to enact
a new decree establishing revised incentive tariffs for PV plants connected to the grid after 31 May 2011: Romani
Decree: C-165, Art. 25.10.

95 Romani Decree: C-165, Arts. 25.9 and 25.10. The new incentive rates to be established were to take into
account the following principles: the establishment of an annual limit on the installed capacity that could benefit from
incentive tariffs; determination of incentive tariff rates which would take into account the reduction of the cost of
technology and of PV plants and the incentives applied in other member states of the EU.

1. For electricity produced by solar photovoltaic plants under this title, the plant
operator (soggetto responsabile) will be entitled to a tariff identified pursuant to
the provisions of annex 5.

2. The tariff is awarded for a period of twenty years commencing from the

operational date of the plant and shall remain constant in current currency for the
entire incentive period.”*

105. Conto IV provided that Producers that connected to the grid between 31 May 2011 and
31 December 2016 had the right to receive a specific incentive tariff for 20 years starting
from the date of grid connection.” The incentive tariffs were different depending on the
month in which the plant in question entered into operation. The rates ranged between
€0.3440 and €0.1720/kWh. For the 7-month period between June through December of
2011, the rates varied on a monthly basis. For 2012 and 2013, the incentive tariff rates
varied by semester.'°° Conto IV also stated that a reduced tariff would apply to new plants

connected to the grid starting in the second semester of 2013.
106. Conto IV included the following new measures:

e Limits on the amount of incentive tariffs granted to new facilities per semester
(e.g. €300 million to large facilities), beyond which the incentive tariffs would

no longer be available for new facilities during that semester. !°!

e An overall cap on the total PV capacity that could benefit from incentive tariffs
and a corresponding cost threshold. The national objective was 23 GW total
installed PV capacity, equivalent to €6 to 7 billion for all the Conto Energia
Decrees incentive tariffs. !°? In other words, the annual cumulative cost for the
incentives under all the Conto Energia Decrees to date would be capped at an

estimated amount between €6 and 7 billion.

Contos II-IV. It is nonetheless relevant to the background of the dispute to set out how the

scheme evolved under the final Conto Energia Decree.
112. Conto V contained two different incentive regimes based on the PV plants’ capacity:

e It made available to plants with capacity of up to one (1) MW an “all-inclusive
tariff’ (both the price of the electricity and the value of the incentive with a

further specific tariff for any self-consumed quantity of energy);! and

e It made available to plants exceeding a capacity of one (1) MW an amount equal
to the difference (if positive) between the all-inclusive tariff mentioned above
and the market price of electricity, plus the revenues derived from the sale of
the energy to the market.!!° Therefore, the value of the incentive component
varied depending on the market price (i.e. if the price of electricity rose, the

incentive value decreased and vice versa).

113. Regardless of a plant’s capacity, Conto V provided a bonus tariff on the electricity the

operator produced and consumed, which would constitute revenue in addition to the

savings that the Producer had from generating its own electricity. !!!

114. Conto V simplified access to the incentive tariffs for underdeveloped plants whose
development needed to be further incentivized given their cost.!!? Other plants could access

the Conto V incentives by applying to a registry that was capped in phases corresponding

to the total cost.'!3

109 Conto V, Arts. 5.1, 5.4. For end users the existence of all-inclusive tariffs was meant to reduce the costs

related to the support scheme. Moreover, this mechanism was aimed at avoiding market distortions under the previous
regimes where the value of the incentive tariffs was stable regardless of the price of energy; Claimants’ Memorial,
141. See also FTI RI, 99 5.26-5.27.

Again, the GSE Agreements confirmed the specific applicable tariff rate constant in current

currency for a period of 20 years.!!4

Although Conto V maintained the provision common in the other Conto Energia Decrees
that any modifications were required to be made in writing by the Parties, it added a new
provision permitting the GSE to unilaterally modify the terms of the Agreement:

GSE retains the right to unilaterally modify the clauses of the present Agreement

which, as a result of any legislative and regulatory amendments are in contrast

with the existing framework. These modifications shall be communicated by GSE

to the Soggetto Responsabile through the electronic portal, not withstanding the

possibility for the Soggetto Responsabile to withdraw from the present contractual
relationship in conformity with provisions of Article 13 above.!!5

Again, the GSE promoted the stability of the incentive rates in Conto V and their 20-year

duration, !!

Article 10 of Conto V introduced a new administrative management fee on PV Producers
who benefited from incentive tariffs under Conto V and the previous Conto Energia
Decrees effective 1 January 2013 (“Administration Fee”). The Administration Fee was
said to cover “GSE Management costs and the cost of checks and controls by GSE”!!” and
was equivalent to €0.0005/kWh of incentivised energy.!!* The Fee could be directly off-
set against the incentive tariffs paid to Producers under the Conto Energia Decrees but was

applied against the GSE’s first payment of incentive tariffs to a Producer in a given year.!!?

Conto V provided that it would cease to apply 30 days after the AEEG issued a resolution
announcing that the Respondent had added €700 million to the total annual cost of the
incentive tariffs program, thereby bringing the grand total of all the Conto Energia Decrees
incentives to €6.7 billion.'2° On 6 June 2013, the AEEG issued a resolution advising that

the total cost of the incentive tariffs program had reached the threshold of €6.7 billion and

electricity grid.

120. On 5 July 2012, the AEEG adopted Resolution No. 281, which required renewable energy

Producers to pay imbalance costs as of 1 January 2013 (“Imbalance Costs”). !??

a. Minimum Guaranteed Prices under the Off-Take Regime

121. In addition to the incentive tariffs in the Conto Energia Decrees, in 2007, through
Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Respondent also implemented an “Off-Take
Regime” to support certain renewable energy facilities that had difficulties competing with

traditional energy Producers, namely those under 1 MW.!?3

122. It appears that “Minimum Guaranteed Prices” or “MGP” were first introduced by the
AEEG by way of Resolution No. 34/05.'4 The Resolution did not distinguish between

renewable energy sources and Producers.

123. The Off-Take regime mandated grid managers, if requested by a Producer, to purchase all
electricity fed into the grid for an established price per kWh'?> from renewable energy
plants that Italy deemed “were not in a condition to participate in the market due to their
high costs and technological immaturity.”!7° The Regime initially concerned the first two

million kWh of electricity produced by plants fuelled by “non-programmable” sources such

AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007 entered into force on 1 January 2008. From that point
forward, the MGP were revised each year by the AEEG and differentiated by renewable
energy source (solar, wind, hydro, etc.), after analysis of generation costs. The minimum
prices were established in “tranches” on the basis of the energy produced. The MGP for
PV plants from 2008 through 2013 were as follows: !3°

 

The 2011 Romani Decree contained a provision concerning the MGP,'3’ which was
initially interpreted as eliminating the MGP for those plants that also received tariffs under
the Conto Energia Decrees. However, the AEEG determined that this was not the case and
did not reduce the scope of application of MGPs to those facilities already in operation and
that the provisions of the Romani Decree in question “seems to refer to new incentivizing
instruments to be defined with effects as of 2013.”'*8 Accordingly, plants under 1 MW that
received Conto tariffs established prior to 2013 could still benefit from both those and the

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENTS IN THE RESPONDENT’S PV SECTOR

131. The Claimants are investment funds managed by KGAL Investment Management GmbH
& Co. KG (“KGAL”), a German investment management company.'#° After making
similar investments in Germany and Spain, KGAL decided to establish PV-dedicated

investment funds and invest in Italy on the basis of its support schemes for PV facilities. '4!

qd) ESPF’s Investments in Italy

132. Based on its assessment of Contos I and II, in late 2009 and early 2010, ESPF acquired its

142

first two PV projects: Montalto and Guglionesi.'** The overall original investment cost was

approximately €21 million, which was financed entirely with equity and shareholder loans
provided by ESPF’s shareholders.'#? These plants entered into operation in October
2010 and April 2011, respectively, and thus qualified under Conto II for an incentive tariff
of €0.346/kWh. '#4

133. On 20December 2010, ESPF added two PV compounds or facilities: Carlino
1 (113 plants) and Carlino 3 (125 plants), for a cost of €18.3 million.'*° These facilities

Cc. THE CHALLENGED MEASURES
148. The key Challenged Measure is the reduction of the Conto incentive tariffs by way of the

167

2014 Spalmaincentivi Decree, discussed below at paragraphs 187-196. The second most
important measure, according to the Claimants, is the reduction of the Minimum
Guaranteed Prices under the Off-Take Regime, discussed below at paragraphs 158-166.
The remaining, more particularized, Challenged Measures include the imposition of
Administration Fees and Imbalance Costs, and the failure by Italy to reimburse
€437,220 paid on account of the allegedly wrongful “Robin Hood Tax”! and €3.7 million
in IMU and TASI Charges.'®* The Robin Hood Tax was deemed illegal by the Italian
Constitutional Court, with prospective effect from the date of the Court’s ruling; while the
IMU and TASI Charges resulted from a change in the classification policy in government-

issued Circulars which reclassified PV facilities from movable to immovable property.

dd) Alleged Reduction of Financial Support to PV Producers (2012-2013)

In 2012, the Respondent enacted several measures that reduced the level of support to the
Claimants’ PV plants. The Claimants allege that these measures were wrongful
modifications of the incentive tariffs which Italy had guaranteed to plants once they
qualified under a particular Conto, and therefore violated what they say were the
Respondent’s commitments of stability and predictability under the ECT, and breached the
express terms of the Conto Energia Decrees and GSE Agreements.'® Since their PV plants
were already built (and 80-90% capital costs sunk) by the time these measures were
implemented, the Claimants contend that they have been forced to continue to operate for
less remuneration than what was guaranteed to them by Italy. For the reasons discussed

below, Italy denies all of the Claimants’ allegations.

The Challenged Measures enacted during the 2012-2013 period, in chronological order,

are as follows:

e Administration management fees, which the Claimants assert were not

previously envisioned under the Conto Energia Decrees;!”

e A reduction of the Minimum Guaranteed Prices offered to plants under 1 MW
under the Off-Take Regime, followed by the abolishment of the right to the
Prices for plants over 100 kw;'7!

e A requirement for PV producers to pay Imbalance Costs;!7*
e An alleged failure to resolve domestic complaints regarding:

othe “Robin Hood Tax” decision;!” and

othe reclassification of PV plants as “immovable property;”!

e The reduction of the Conto incentive tariffs by the Spalmaincentivi Decree.

The Claimants allege that the Challenged Measures were a “bait-and-switch” by the
Respondent which enticed investment in the renewable sector through promises of support
and then reduced or clawed back that support once the investments were made.!’> The
Respondent contests the Claimants’ “theorem of an intentional ‘bait-and-switch’,” and
argues that there is no direct connection between the Challenged Measures, some of which
are “completely extraneous to the support schemes to PV energy sources that are the focus

of this dispute.”!7°

a. Administration Fees

The Claimants contend that the Administration Fees were an indirect way of reducing the

Conto incentive tariffs, and resulted in a loss of €1 million.!””

Conto V, enacted in June 2012, provided that as of | January 2013, all PV producers with
incentive tariffs under any Conto Energia Decree were required to pay an annual
“administrative management fee” corresponding to €0.0005 per kWh of incentivized
energy, to cover the GSE’s management, verification and control expenses.'7® The
Administration Fee could be directly offset against the incentive tariffs paid to Producers
under the Conto Energia Decrees.' However, the GSE later clarified that the
Administration Fee would be offset against the GSE’s first payment of incentive tariffs to

the Producer in a given year.'*°

Conto V provides that “it is appropriate and fair that those who benefit from the FITs for

PV contribute to the coverage of charges for the management of the PV incentive scheme,”

particularly in light of Legislative Decree 28/2011, which increased management costs of
the GSE’s monitoring function over the incentive schemes.'*! Article 10.4 of Conto V
provided, in relevant part, as follows:

to cover GSE management costs, and the cost of checks and controls by GSE, the

plant operators that access incentive tariffs under this decree and decrees issued

in implementation of article 7 of legislative decree no. 387,2003 and article

25(10) of legislative decree No. 28,2011 [the previous energy accounts/Conto

Energia Decrees] are under an obligation, commencing from | January 2013, to

pay GSE a contribution of 0.05 euro cents for each kWh of subsidised energy,
also by means of offset with incentives owed.'?

The same allocation of costs is provided for in similar language in the Spalmaincentivi
Decree (LD91/2014) at Article 25(1), which provides, in relevant part, as follows: “charges
incurred by the GSE for the conduct of management, audit and control activities related to
the incentive and support mechanisms, are to be borne by the beneficiaries of the same

activities.” !*

In the Claimants’ view, the Administration Fee introduced under Conto V was

“unexpected” !*4

and directly reduced the remuneration the Claimants reasonably expected
from the fixed tariffs provided for in Contos II, III and IV at the time of investing. !*° The
Claimants assert that Conto I-IV do not provide for such costs.'*® Further, the Claimants
point out that while Italy claims that the “GSE recorded total costs” of €36.4 million in
2013, it does not allege that the GSE had difficulty covering its costs in previous years or
that the GSE’s total costs had increased from previous years. The Claimants state that the

Respondent does not disclose what the GSE’s costs were in previous years, and thus there

is no indication that the GSE’s costs increased in 2013, thereby meriting the Administration

Fee.'*” Further, the Claimants contend that out of the 2,500 inspections carried out in
2013 on PV plants by the GSE, only five percent resulted in a negative outcome for the
Producer, thus “it cannot be said that the need for these inspections warranted imposing

the [A]dministrati[on] [F]ee on PV investors.” !8*

The Respondent denies that this measure is a disguised reduction of incentives,'*? but
acknowledges that the Administration Fee “implies ... [a] loss for each producer, with
respect to the overall incentive received.”!°® The Respondent’s position is that the fee is
very low and it was reasonable to impose the Administration Fee on all PV facilities that
benefited from the administration of the incentive scheme.!*! The Respondent also states

that the fee only applied prospectively as of 1 January 2013.!°?

(i) Reduction of Minimum Guaranteed Prices under the Off-Take Regime

In October 2013, the AEEG issued Consultation Document No. 486 (the “Consultation
Document”), which set out guidelines and proposals for the redefinition of the Minimum
Guaranteed Prices in light of purported changes to the average operating costs for

renewable energy facilities. !°*

The new proposed formula for establishing Minimum Guaranteed Prices was based on the
purported value of the average operating costs of renewable energy facilities, plus eight
percent. The Consultation Document stated that the AEEG would establish the Minimum

Guaranteed Price for PV plants at a lower amount, approximately €37.8 per MWh of

In December 2013, the AEEG issued Resolution No. 618/2013 which established the
Minimum Guaranteed Prices for 2014 in line with Consultation Document No. 486.!°5
Until that time, the Minimum Guaranteed Prices had ranged from between €72.20/MWh
and €105.80/MWh and largely had increased over the previous six years. For 2014, the
AEEG established a single Minimum Guaranteed Price of €38.90/MWh — a decrease of
between 46 and 63%.!°° The AEEG also decreased the amount of electricity that could

benefit from Minimum Guaranteed Prices, from 2 million kWh per year to 1.5 million kWh

164. While the original Decree did not apply to the Claimants’ PV investments,
law, Law 97/2014 of 21 February 2014, did; it confirmed that the Claimants’ PV plants

Prices in the Off-Take Regime (with the exception of plants with a capacity below

the Minimum Guaranteed Prices, albeit at the reduced prices established by the AEEG in
its Resolution No. 618/2013.°

The Claimants further argue that, beginning in 2014, the Respondent reduced the Minimum
Guaranteed Price by 52%, which dropped it “well below” the market price.?”? The
Claimants contest Italy’s explanation that it cut the Prices on the basis of data that the actual
operating costs of smaller facilities were lower.?!° The Minimum Guaranteed Price was
amended as a result of a study of average electricity production costs. The Respondent says
that the Minimum Guaranteed Prices established in 2008 were temporary and that the
market was fully aware of this.7!! As a result, the Respondent submits that the reduction in
the MGP was reasonable, as it was based on actual operating costs, and was not

unexpected.?!”

Imbalance Costs

Imbalance costs result from reserving excess electricity produced.?!* Renewable energy
plants tend to increase overall system imbalance because they are non-programmable.
Policymakers have a choice of either charging producers imbalance charges or passing
them on to consumers.”!* As explained by the Claimants, “imbalance costs are an expected
consequence of the addition of substantial PV capacity to an electricity system, which tends
to increase imbalance in the system because it cannot be programmed to align production
with demand.”?'> The Claimants submit that the original framework did not require PV

producers to pay imbalance costs (or any penalty) that are assessed to a producer as the

difference between what it projects it will put into the grid and what it in fact puts into the

grid.2"°

The Parties agree that the Respondent initially chose not to charge imbalance costs to PV
producers. Instead, these costs were passed on to consumers via their electricity bills and
the AEEG’s 2006 Resolution No. 111 had required Producers to provide advance
production projections to help Italy’s transmission system operator (“TSO”) balance
supply and demand." Resolution No. 111 stated that if a producer deviated from the TSO
injection schedules, it would be required to pay imbalance charges equal to the sale price
of energy accepted on the day-ahead market, which was typically zero for PV plants since

they had no marginal costs.?!*

On 5 July 2012, the AEEG adopted Resolution No. 281/2012, which required renewable
energy producers to pay imbalance costs as of 1 January 2013 (“Imbalance Costs”).7!” By
way of its Resolution No. 493/2012, the AEEG implemented the method by which the

Imbalance Costs would apply to Producers.?”°

The Claimants assert that Conto I-IV do not provide for the payment of Imbalance Costs,

and thus they cannot be imposed “midstream” and that these “unexpected”?!

charges
amount to a reduction in the Conto tariffs.” The Claimants maintain that these costs were

part of the design of Italy’s incentive system and were clearly foreseeable by it and its

authorities. They say that “[p]assing those costs on to producers after the fact is just a clever

way to reduce the tariff”?

Conversely, the Respondent’s position is that it was reasonable to impose Imbalance Costs
on PV facilities because of the “huge development of non-programmable renewable energy
sources” that came to be connected to the grid as a direct result of Italy’s incentive

programs.?*+

Energy producers immediately challenged Resolution Nos. 281 and 493, and in June 2013,
Italy’s highest administrative court, the Consiglio di Stato, held that the AEEG’s two
Resolutions were unlawful, since they failed to differentiate amongst different types of
renewable energy sources.””> The Claimants submit that, as a result of that judgment, in
many cases the GSE reimbursed the Imbalance Costs that Producers had already paid under

the Resolutions.””°

In October 2014, the AEEG issued Resolution 522, which once again imposed Imbalance
Costs, which apply to the PV plants owned and operated by the Claimants’ subsidiaries,

effective 1 January 2015.77

Failure to Reimburse Allegedly Wrongfully Imposed Payments

Two of the Claimants’ claims relate to the Respondent’s alleged failure to correct measures
previously held unlawful or unfair, and its refusal to reimburse the Claimants for payments
they made in accordance with those measures.” The first concerns Italy’s application of

forward (ex nunc), rather than retroactive (ex tunc), basis. The second involves Italy’s

reclassification of PV facilities as immovable property, rather than movable property.

i. Robin Hood Tax

175. In 2008, the Respondent enacted a windfall profits tax on the profits of oil, gas and other
conventional energy companies (the “Robin Hood Tax”), but exempted renewable energy
producers.”?° The Robin Hood Tax was implemented by way of an increase in the corporate
tax of certain companies. In 2011, the Respondent extended the application of the Robin
Hood Tax to all energy producers, including renewable energy producers, with a gross
annual income of over €10 million and a taxable income of over €1 million.”*° Italy also
increased the corporate income tax rate of companies subject to the Robin Hood Tax from
34% to 38%, which applied to fiscal years 2011 through 2013.73! This development was
met with criticism from an environmental organization, the AEEG, various industry

associations, and the Parliamentary Committees for Industry and the Environment.?**

176. In June 2013, the Respondent further extended the Robin Hood Tax by reducing the
applicable income thresholds to gross annual income over €3 million and taxable income
over €300,000.7** This regulatory change by Italy made the Robin Hood Tax applicable to

the Claimants’ PV plants.

177. In February 2015, the Italian Constitutional Court ruled that the extension of the Robin

Hood Tax to renewable energy producers was unconstitutional.”*4 The Court held that its

decision would not apply retroactively and that it would only have effect as of the date of

its publication.”°>

The Claimants assert that “Italy’s failure to fairly apply its court ruling or compensate
Claimants for sums paid to Italy under an unconstitutional law is unfair, arbitrary, and a
violation of the [ECT].”?*° The Claimants argue that it is unfair and in breach of the ECT
for Italy to deem an unlawful measure unconstitutional, but then fail to void that measure
ab initio, and thereby keep money that it admits it wrongfully took from the Claimants’
investments.”*” The Claimants’ Italian Constitutional Law expert is of the view that the
Constitutional Court’s ruling that the decision only apply on a going-forward basis also
violates Italian legal principles.”* The Claimants do not contend that the enactment of the
Robin Hood Tax itself violated the ECT; nor do they say they need to, since Italy has itself

already declared the tax unconstitutional.?*?

As will be discussed in Section VII, below, Italy argued that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction
over the Claimants’ Robin Hood Tax claim since it arises from a fiscal or tax measure,
which is excluded from the scope of the ECT pursuant to Article 21 of the Treaty. Further,
Italy objected that since the decision of the Constitutional Court, and the dispute between
the Parties, regarding the Robin Hood Tax occurred after the Claimants submitted their
Amicable Settlement Letters of June 2014 and March 2015, this Robin Hood Tax claim
amounts to a new claim, which is inadmissible because no attempt has been made to resolve

it amicably pursuant to Article 26(1) of the ECT.

With respect to the merits of the claim, the Respondent says that the annulment of the
Robin Hood Tax by the Constitutional Court did not amount to an acknowledgment by

Italy of any infringement of the ECT. It also says that the Court annulled the tax on the

Decision No. 10/2015 of the Italian Constitutional Court, 11 February 2015: C-255, p. 15.

basis that it improperly implemented a corporate tax, rather than implementing an

additional contribution linked to windfall profits in the energy sector.”

Further, the Respondent says that the Court considered the question of the retroactive effect
of its judgment and found it appropriate to limit the application of its decision from the
date of its publication going forward (ex nunc). Accordingly, the Respondent says that its
authorities were required to respect the Court’s decision and cannot be said to have acted

in bad faith.7*!

ii. Reclassification of PV Facilities as “Immovable Property”

Since at least 2007, the Italian Revenue Agency had considered PV plants as movable
property, which was subject to higher depreciation rates, and thus lower effective tax

rates.?4

Following a circular issued by Italy’s tax authorities in December 2013 (the

“2013 Circular”), the Respondent reclassified PV plants as immovable property, which

had three main effects:?47

e The applicable depreciation rate for PV plants was reduced from nine percent
to a maximum of four percent per year. The lower depreciation rate resulted in

higher taxable income of PV plant owners.

e The Claimants’ PV facilities became subject to a fee referred to as the “IMU

Charge,” which the local municipality charges on buildings.

e The Claimants’ PV facilities became subject to another municipal charge
known as the “TASI Charge,” to cover municipal services such as road

maintenance and public lighting.

The Claimants say that, in response to criticism, the 2016 Budget Law provided that, as of
1 January 2016, the value of certain types of immovable property was to be calculated
based on the ground, building and structural elements of the building, without including
the value of certain movable elements such as “machinery, devices, equipment and other
facilities used in the specific industrial process.”*“+ The 2016 Budget Law thus reduced the

portion of PV facilities that had been deemed to be immovable property.

The Claimants allege that the classification of PV facilities in the 2013 Circular as
immovable property was arbitrary and inconsistent with the Italian Revenue Agency’s
classification of these facilities as movable property at the time the relevant investments
were made. The Claimants submit that the 2016 Budget Law represents the Respondent’s
admission of its classification error and is its attempt to correct the most negative effects
of the reclassification by allowing PV investors to characterize most of their facilities as
“movable” property.?4> The Claimants submit that Italy has taken no steps to compensate
them “for the sums wrongfully paid to Italy as a result of its unfair classification and
confusing guidance on this point.”?4° The Claimants say that while the 2016 Budget Law
effectively corrected most of the effect of the 2013 Circular, it did not permit their facilities
to offset or otherwise recover the €3.7 million in IMU Charges paid under the “unfair

classification” of the 2013 Circular.74”

The Respondent says that any reasonable investor should have known that circulars issued
by fiscal authorities are not binding and if an investor wishes to rely on a formal answer or
interpretation given by the Italian Revenue Agency, it must make a formal written request

for interpretation (an interpello). The Claimants did not rely on this procedure and,

therefore, no legitimate expectation could arise from their reliance on a tax circular. The
Respondent says that the 2013 Circular was issued to respond to questions from operators
on the treatment of PV plants for different fiscal and cadastral purposes and provided
clarification in line with existing Italian law.?“* Further, the Respondent says that the
2016 Budget Law did not modify the definition of PV plants as either movable or
immovable property.?*? Rather, it established a favourable regime which assisted PV
energy producers to reduce fiscal payments by allowing them to characterize most of their
facilities as “movable property.” It also provided an indemnity for municipalities facing a

reduced income as a result.?°°

b. Reduction of the Conto Incentive Tariffs (2014) — Spalmaincentivi Decree

187. On 24 June 2014, the Respondent enacted Law Decree No. 91 (the “Spalmaincentivi
Decree”), which purported to “redistribute” or “remodulate” the incentive tariffs granted
to PV plants with a maximal capacity above 200 kW under all of the Conto Energia

Decrees and GSE Agreements, effective 1 January 2015.7°!

188. The Spalmaincentivi Decree provided, in relevant part, as follows:

Article 23.
(Reduction of electricity bills in favor of medium and low voltage served clients)

1. In order to ensure a more fair allocation of tariffs costs between the different
categories of electricity consumers, the lower costs for users deriving from arts.
24 to 30 of this law-decree, to the extent they affect single components of
electricity fees, are destined to the reduction of electricity fees of medium and low
voltage served clients with a connection power available (potenza disponibile)
higher than 16.5 other than residential customers and public lighting. (...)

248

 

The Respondent's position is that its 2013 Circular and its reclassification was not unexpected or arbitrary.
It was merely a fair classification of an issue “that had generated some uncertainty in the market.” Respondent’s

S.p.A. (GSE) disburses the incentive tariffs mentioned in paragraph 1 with
constant monthly installments amounting to 90% of the estimated yearly average
production of each PV plant and pays the balance, in relation to the actual
production of electrical energy, within the 30th of June of the following year. The
operating modalities will be declined by the GSE no later than 15 days from the
publication of this Decree with a ministerial decree to be issued by the Ministry
of Economic Development.

3. Starting from 1 January 2015, the incentive tariffs for electrical energy
produced by PV plants having a capacity higher than 200 kW is remodulated,
upon the producer’s choice to be communicated to the GSE no later than
30 November 2014, on the basis of one of the following options:

a) the incentive tariffs is disbursed for a 24-year period, starting from the of
entry into operation of the PV plant, and consequently recalculated pursuant
to the percentage of reduction set out in the Table 2 annexed to this Decree

1) 6% for PV plants having a capacity included within 200 and 500 kW;
2) 7% for PV plants having a capacity included within 500 and 900 kW; and
3) 8% for PV plants having a capacity higher than 900 kW.

In the absence of a communication from the producer, the GSE will apply the
option provided under letter (c).

4. In relation to the aggregate tariffs (Note: the so called tariffe omnicomprensive)
disbursed in accordance to the Ministerial Decree of 5 May 2011 published on the
Official Gazette no. 109 of 12 May 2011 (Note: the so called Fourth Conto

provided in the table annexed to this Decree will apply only on the incentivizing
component, to be calculated on the basis of the provision set forth by Article 5 (2),
second paragraph, of the aforementioned ministerial decree.

5. The recipients of the incentive tariffs mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 may

incentive tariff as of 31 December 2014 and the remodulated incentive tariff
pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4. Such loans can benefit, cumulatively or
alternatively, on the basis of agreements with the banking system, of funding or

1 (47) of Law no. 147/2013, Cdp’s exposure is guaranteed by the Italian State
with modalities to be determined with a decree to be issued by the Ministry of
Economics and Finance.

 

6. Should it be necessary in relation to the remodulated duration of the
disbursement of the incentive tariffs, the Regions and the local entities adapt, each
in relation to their competences, the duration of the permits, however named,
issued for the construction and operation of the PV plants falling within the scope
of application of this Article 26. (...)

7. The recipients of long-term incentive tariffs, however named, for the
production of renewable energy, can sell up to 80% of such incentives to a buyer
selected amongst the “primary European financial players.”

8. The selected buyer will replace the producers in their right to benefit from the
long-term incentive tariffs from the entity entitled to disburse them (Note: i.e. the

financial depreciation of the cost incurred for the purchase of the rights during a
timeframe comparable to that of the disbursement of the incentive tariffs.

9. Within 90 days from the entry into force of this Law, AEEG issues resolutions
with which:

a) determine the modalities for the selection of the buyer through a
competitive and non discriminatory tender procedure having as main
choosing criteria the minimum offered value of the interest rate T mentioned
in paragraph 8;

b) determine the minimum amount, in any case no lower tha[n] € 30 billion,
that the buyer makes available for the purchase of the long term incentive
tariffs;

c) define the conditions, procedures and modalities with which the buyer
collects the long term incentive tariffs for sale or, alternatively, the annual
installments — in the event AEEG should exercise the purchase option
mentioned in paragraph 8;

d) determine the criteria and the procedures to determine, also in
consideration of the type and location of the plants, the quotas of long-term
incentive tariffs which the producers can transfer;

e) define the conditions, procedures and any other useful parameter to
regulate the transfer of the quotas of the long-term incentives, to be
implemented through competitive bids on the basis of the offered interest
rate - which in any case cannot be lower than the interest rate T offered by
the selected buyer — and within a maximum cap of the incentives established
for each auction;

£) determine for each auction the participation modalities, the minimum
discount rate and the maximum cap established for the purchase of the long-
term incentives keeping in mind — should the auctions be distinguished on
the basis of the type or the dimensions of the plants — the specifications in
terms of number, the estimated cost of capital and managing skills related
to complex procedures;

g) define any other aspect regarding the selection procedure and the auctions
which could be useful in order to maximize the participation thereto,
including forms of guarantee excluding the direct or indirect intervention of
the Italian State.

10. AEEG, in compliance with the guidelines to be issued with a decree of the
Ministry of Economic Development, allocates the eventual difference between
the annual cost of the incentives purchased by the selected buyer pursuant to
paragraph 7 and the annual disbursements provided by paragraph 8 for the
reduction of the A3 component of the electricity bill.

11. The Italian Government carries out any useful initiative in order to fully
implement this Article, including agreements with the banking system, in order to
simplify the partial or entire withdrawal of the recipients of incentive tariffs from
the loan agreements entered into.

12. The remodulation procedures provided in paragraph 3 above do not apply to

the quotas of the incentive tariffs transferred pursuant to paragraph 9, as of the
date of the transfer.

13. The effectiveness of the provision contained in paragraphs 7 to 12 above is
subject to the verification, by the competent Ministry of Finance, of the

In short, the Spalmaincentivi Decree specified three tariff options, from which plant owners
were required to choose one by 30 November 2014, failing which option (c) would be

applied by the GSE:?°?

(a) A reduction in the incentive tariff between 17-25% depending on how many years of
the original 20-year incentive period remained (the “Residual Period”), with the
extension of payments to be spread over 24 years (rather than the original 20-year

period);

(b) Depending on the length of the remaining Residual Period, a reduction in the incentive
tariff for a first part of the Residual Period, followed by an increase in the incentive
tariff in a second part of the Residual Period (to be paid over the remainder of the

original 20-year period applicable to each facility); or

(c) A reduction in the incentive tariff between 6-8%, based on the size of the facility in

question, with no modification of the 20-year incentive period.

The Spalmaincentivi Decree was intended to benefit primarily small and medium

enterprises, which where medium and low voltage users.?>?

On 25 November 2014, the Claimants’ subsidiaries which own and operate PV facilities
all wrote to the GSE to protest that the provisions of Article 26 of the Spalmaincentivi
Decree were in breach of their constitutional and contractual rights, and they reserved their

rights to take action in response.**+ The Claimants did not choose an option and therefore

192. Under the GSE Agreements, the incentive tariff under the Conto Energia Decrees was paid
monthly based on a PV plant’s actual production. In contrast, the Spalmaincentivi Decree

provided that from the second semester of 2014, the GSE would pay the tarif

 

in monthly
instalments amounting to 90% of the plant’s estimated yearly average production of
electricity.2°° The balance would be delayed for 6-18 months, which Claimants argue

193. The Spalmaincentivi Decree replaced the Administration Fee that Conto V had imposed on
all Producers receiving Conto Energia incentives, discussed above, with a new
administration fee based on a PV plant’s capacity (rather than on its output). This new fee
was due on an annual basis, and paid by off-setting these against the incentive tariff

payments due under the GSE Agreements.”** The new fee ranges were as follows:
e €1.20/kW for plants above 1 MW of capacity.
e €2.20/kW for plants comprised between 3 and 6 kW of capacity.

The Claimants say that the Spalmaincentivi Decree fundamentally altered the incentive
tariffs granted to their facilities in breach of the express terms of the Conto Energia
Decrees, the GSE Agreements and the many assurances by Italian officials and authorities

that the tariffs would remain unchanged for their 20-year term.?°!

The Respondent says that the Spalmaincentivi Decree did not abolish or fundamentally
alter the incentive regime, but remodulated it to reduce the cost of electricity for small and
medium-sized business and to enhance the competitiveness of Italian markets. This was
done by progressive measures offering three different alternatives to operators to permit
them to select the best alternative for them. The Respondent says these were reasonable
and proportionate measures. In addition, the Respondent says that the Spalmaincentivi
Decree was intended to promote sustainability of the incentive scheme for renewable

energy and to reduce the social burden on electricity consumers.”

2017 CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECISION

On 24 January 2017, the Italian Constitutional Court released its judgment of 7 December
2016 on the challenge to the legitimacy of Article 26(2) and (3) of the Spalmaincentivi
Decree (“2017 Constitutional Court Decision”).*® In its decision, the Court upheld the
constitutionality of the challenged provisions of the Spalmaincentivi Decree. The Court’s

judgment reads, in part, as follows:

8. The challenges of violation of the other constitutional and European principles
indicated in various orders of TAR Lazio share a common reason, which is the
violation that article 26, para. 3, Decree 2014/91 supposedly has brought to the
legitimate reliance which the percipients of the incentives had put in maintaining
their firm position of advantage recognized in the agreements signed with GSE.

8.1. As a matter of principle, the reliance of citizens in legal certainty is “a
fundamental and indispensable element of the rule of law (decision 822/88 and
349/85). However- as the firm case-law of this Court, in coherence also with that
of the ECtHR, has clarified - protection of reliance does not entail, in our legal
system, that the legislature may not enact provisions which change unfavorably
the regulation of long-term relationships, and this even if their object are perfect
legal rights [“diritti soggettivi perfetti”|. The only exception is, in matters of

Decision”): R-032.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5

criminal law, that of the prohibition of retroactive norms, set by article 25, second
para., of the Constitution.” It remains firm that such provisions, “as any other legal
norm, must not result in an irrational regulation, arbitrarily effecting substantial
rights created by the previous law, frustrating in such way also the reliance of
citizens in legal certainty” (decision 822/88; and in analogous sense decisions
203/16; 64/14; 1/11; 302/10; 24,206 and 236/09; 264 and 409/05; 446/02;
416/99).

8.2. The analysis of the ratio of the contested norm excludes that it has
unreasonably and unforeseeably affected the long-term relations, arising from the
agreements reached by the percipients of the incentives with GSE, therefore
violating the principle of legal certainty. In fact, the legislature in 2014 has
intervened in a general context in which, on the one hand, the remuneration of
incentivizing fees for energy produced through photovoltaic apparatus was
gradually increasing, taking into account both the costs of production as a result
of the considerable technological development of the sector, and the overall
European framework. But on the other hand, and correlatively, one registered the
growing economic burden of such incentives on the final users of electric energy,
especially on SMEs which are the fabric of national industry.

Therefore the legislature, following a balancing objective, has operated with the
aim of “favouring a higher sustainability in the policies of support to renewable
energies” (article 26, para. 1, Decree 2014/91) and to “reach a more fair
distribution of the economic burdens among the various categories of users.” The
legislature has therefore established that the lesser burdens for users as a result of
the reduction of the incentives for photovoltaic apparatuses should be “destined
to the reduction of electricity fees for clients of low and medium tension
electricity” (article 23, Decree 2014/91).

Such an intervention pursues a public interest, through a fair balancing of the
opposing interest at play, promoting at the same time the policies of support to the
production of energy from renewable sources, and a more sustainable burden for
the final users of electric energy. The incentives to photovoltaic are among the so
called general fees of electrical system and are paid also by the final user, directly,
through the component A/3 of the electricity bill.

8.3 (...) The decrees that have been issued on the basis of said article 7 are known
as “conti energia” and are progressively numbered in accordance with the various,
subsequent, versions which have enacted five different procedures of support.

It must be said that, in the context of such general normative framework, the
enforcement of systems of incentives to renewable energies is characterized by
long-term stability in order to ensure certainty for investors. In particular Decree
2011/28- which according to TAR Lazio has amplified the notion of “stability,”
states that “the incentive remains constant for all the due period” (article 24, para.
2, letter c).

However, the guarantee of stability of the incentive for all the due period does not
imply, however, as a necessary consequence, that the measure should remain
unchanged for 20 years, unchanged and unaffected by the variations which are
common to long-term contracts. This is even truer if one considers that the
agreements reached with GSE cannot be qualified as contracts meant to determine
the exclusive profit of the operator, with terms and conditions blocked at the initial
conditions, for twenty years, even if technological conditions may change
profoundly. They are instead regulatory instruments, aimed at reaching the

Award
Page 78

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5

objective of incentivizing certain sources of energy in equilibrium with other
sources of renewable energy, and with the minimum sacrifice for the users who
ultimately bear the economic burden.

In the evolution of the sectorial legislation there are, in fact, elements contrary to
the purported consolidation of an acquired right of the beneficiaries of the
incentive to maintain unchanged the initial incentive for the whole twenty years
of the agreed length of the agreement. Decree 2011/28, at its article 23, para. 1,
expressly balances the objective of “stability of the systems of incentives,” with
that of “harmonization with other systems having analogous aims and the
reduction of the specific burden put on consumers.”

In this same line the third “conto energia” (Decree 6.8.201 0), adopted on the basis
of the previous Decree 2003/387 mentioned the need to adapt the incentivizing
fees in the wake of the diminished costs of photovoltaic technologies in order to
abide by the principle of fair remuneration of investments.

The fourth “conto energia” (Decree 5.5.2011) foresees, at its article 2, para. 3, the
possibility to revise the incentives.

In the general agreement, laid out by the Independent Energy Authority on
December 6, 2012 one finds this express provision (article 17, para. 3): “GSE
reserves the right to modify unilaterally the clauses of this Agreement which, as
a consequence of legislative or regulatory changes, are in contrast with the present
legal framework.”

Decree 23.12.2013, n. 14 (...) converted into Law 28.2.2014, n. 9, immediately
prior to the contested provision, underlined, in its recitals, “the extraordinary and
urgent need to enact provisions for the roll-out of the 'Destinazione Italia’ plan,
for the reduction of electricity and gas fees” considered as essential elements for
the promotion of competitivity of Italian enterprises and to attract investments in
Italy.

These elements exclude that the down-sizing of the incentives introduced by the
contested provision presents the purported characters of “unforesceability,” while
instead it was, in some ways, anticipated and aimed precisely to ensure the
‘stability’ taken into account by the laws that introduced incentives to photovoltaic
energy, as a characteristic of the whole system and not of the single incentive.

Furthermore it is an element naturally connected to the normative risk of
enterprises in a regulated market such as the one here examined.

8.4. TAR Lazio furthermore expresses the doubt that the way through which the
legislator has operated with the contested provision is unreasonable and
disproportionate. Also this allegation is unfounded. The down-sizing of the
incentives does not affect radically the investments that have been made as, in an
abstract way and without any concrete evidence in the various proceedings, is
claimed, but is regulated in such a way as to take into account its sustainability.

In fact, in alternative to the, last, case of reduction of the incentives in a not
excessive percentage which ranges from 6% to 8% according to the size of the
apparatuses, and without prejudice to the 20 year period, the owner of the plant
may choose among two options: or to balance the reduction of the incentives with
a prolongation of the agreement of further 4 years; or to join a first period of
reduction of the incentive with an equal, following, period in which the incentive

Award
Page 79

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5

is increased “in equal size.” The downsizing of the incentives is, furthermore,
accompanied by compensatory benefits such as the possibility for the percipients
of these incentives to receive bank loans up to the difference between the present
incentive and the new one. These loans can be granted on the basis of agreements
with the banks guaranteed by ‘Cassa Depositi e Prestiti’ (a public financial
institution) (article 26, para. 5).

They may also assign their incentive to a “selected primary European financial
operator” (article 26, para. 7, Decree 2014/91). In such a way the investments are,
ultimately, safeguarded through the gradual process of downsizing, via the
various options offered by the law and by the compensatory measures which
reduce the economic impact of the reduction in the incentives, while ensuring the
fair remuneration of the investments.

9(...) The Court of Justice of the European Union in its well-known decision
Plantanol GmbH y. Hauptzollamt Darmstadt (C-201/08, of 10.9.2009) which is
cited also in the orders of TAR Lazio, has recognized that the before-time
abolition of a system of benefits falls within the discretional power of national
authorities. The only limitation is the reliance that “a prudent and careful business
operator” might have put in the maintenance of the system.

As mentioned before the legislature's intervention has not been nor unforeseeable
nor sudden, and therefore “a prudent and careful business operator” could have
taken into account the possible changes in legislation, considering the temporary
and variable nature of support schemes.

10. The allegation of violation of articles 3 and 41 of the Constitution, on the basis
of discriminatory treatment, is equally unfounded.

The different size of the various plants, with a power higher or lower than 200 KW
in itself justified the re-scheduling fees only with regards those above 200 KW
which receive the most of the incentives, with a related higher burden on the
system.

There is no disparity of treatment in the fact that plants belonging to local
authorities or schools, even if above 200 KW, have been excluded from the re-
scheduling of the incentives, considering the obvious differences between the
categories of producers and the reasons of public interest which justify an
exception in favour of public entities and of schools.

Nor can one consider more founded the allegation that there would be a
discriminatory treatments towards solar energy producers in respect of other
percipients of incentives equally financed by users through the so-called general
system fees.

Also in this case TAR Lazio, although it acknowledges the considerable
developments of photovoltaic energy, does not give the appropriate importance to
the reasons (among which the size of plants) which are at the basis of varied
legislation for photovoltaic energy and other renewable sources of energy.

11. Finally there is no violation of private autonomy because, purportedly, the
reduction of the incentives has affected “private law contracts.”

Setting aside the fact that such “contracts” are accessory to the provisions granting
the incentives, one should recall the principle- which has been repeatedly stated

Award
Page 80

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 81

by this court- that there cannot be a violation of the freedom of economic initiative
when the general limits that have been put aim at promoting social welfare, as
established by article 41, para. 2, of the Constitution, provided that the measures
are not arbitrary and the intervention of the legislature does not pursue its aim
through measures which are clearly incongruous. (among the many decision
203/16; 56/15; 152 and 247 /10; 167 /09).

Both these requirements, as already said, have been complied by the provisions
reducing and rescheduling the incentives.?**

198. The Claimants say that the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision has no direct relevance and
may not influence the Tribunal’s assessment and application of the ECT standards and

related principles of international law. The decision is only relevant, at most, as a matter of

fact for the Tribunal to consider.?°5

199. The Respondent says that its Italian Constitutional Court decisions are relevant both as
applicable law and as fact. It says that while the task of the Tribunal is to determine whether
it has violated the ECT, and not whether the measures it took comply with Italian law, the
latter should nevertheless influence the legal standards that the Tribunal applies to

determine whether it violated the ECT or international law.?%

204 2017 Constitutional Court Decision: R-032. The decision of the Constitutional Court was discussed at some
length in the expert reports of the Parties’ respective legal experts: Professor Attorney Antonio D’Atena on behalf of
the Claimants: “D’Atena ER1,” “D’Atena ER2;” Professors Vincenzo Zeno-Zencovich and Antonio Caratta, on
behalf of the Respondent: “Zeno-Zencovich/Caratta ER1,” “Zeno-Zencovich/Caratta ER2.”

265 Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief (“CPHB”), §§] 24-30. The Claimants also say that, pursuant to Art. 26(6)
VCLT and the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a state party may not invoke the provisions of its internal laws as
justification for its failure to perform a treaty. They also note that the Court’s decision only became known in January
2017 and, therefore, was rendered a number of years after the Claimants had made their investments. The Claimants
also say that the GSE Agreement which the Court considered was the contract under Conto V that contained a new
provision which permitted the GSE to unilaterally modify the clauses of the Agreement as a result of any legislative
and regulatory amendments. In contrast, the GSE Agreements under Contos I-IV provided that modifications to the
Agreements could only be made in writing with the agreement of both parties.

266 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief (“RPHB”), {f] 32-38. The Respondent relies on the Constitutional Court’s
decision with respect to legitimate expectations, and says that the standards applying to legitimate expectations and
fair and equitable treatment, in general, must be assessed by considering both domestic and international case law.
The Respondent goes on to state that the Italian Constitutional Court has consistently applied the principle of legitimate
expectations and found that these do not imply an absolute preclusion on the modification of contracts, even in the
case of long term relationships and vested rights. Accordingly, the Respondent says that if one invests in Italy, an
investor cannot expect that because of the existence of a contract in itself, the legislator is automatically prevented
from modifying its legislation. It also notes that the GSE Agreements, in its view, are accessory contracts and not
merely private law contracts. The Respondent also says that since the Constitutional Court has declared the legitimacy
of the Spalmaincentivi Decree under Italian law, there can be no infringement of the umbrella clause in the ECT as a
matter of fact and of law.

The Tribunal addresses first the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility. Then after
determining the applicable law (Issue 3), the Tribunal turns to the merits (Issue 4). The
Tribunal then considers whether the Claimants are entitled to damages (Issue 5) and interest

(Issue 6). Finally, the Tribunal addresses the appropriate allocation of costs (Issue 7).
REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
The Claimants request an Award granting them the following relief:

e A declaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID
Convention for all of the Claimants’ claims, thereby rejecting the Respondent’s

jurisdictional objections in full;

e A declaration that Italy has violated Part III of the ECT and international law

with respect to the Claimants’ investments;

e¢ Compensation to the Claimants for all damages they have suffered as set forth
in their Memorial and in their Reply Memorial and as may be further developed

and quantified during the course of this proceeding;

and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID;

e  Pre- and post-award compound interest at the highest lawful rate from the Date

of Assessment, infra, until Italy’s full and final satisfaction of the Award; and
e Any other relief the Tribunal deems just and proper.”
203. The Respondent requests that the Tribunal:
e Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the ECT does not cover intra-EU disputes.
e Alternatively, decline jurisdiction over the totality of claims, since:
o Some of the Challenged Measures are exempted under Article 21 of the ECT;
o No amicable solution has been attempted for some further Measures; and

o The exclusivity forum choice contained in the GSE Agreements bans this Tribunal

from judging under the umbrella clause.

e Ina further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the Claimants’
alleged interests since these are barred from seeking relief, as they did not seek

amicable solution for a number of claims.

204. Should the Tribunal consider itself to have jurisdiction over the case and that claims are
either totally or partially admissible, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare on

the merits that:

is a Contracting Party to the ECT and a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.?”
Although the Respondent withdrew from the ECT effective 1 January 2016, the ECT
remains in force for Italy for 20 years from that date.°”! Third, the Parties consented to
ICSID Jurisdiction. The Claimants say that the Respondent gave its unconditional consent
to the submission of this dispute to ICSID arbitration in Article 26(3) of the ECT, which
serves as the necessary consent under the ICSID Convention.?” Fourth, the dispute
involves a covered “investment.”?”* Fifth, the dispute arises directly out of an investment
and concems the alleged breach of Part III of the ECT.2% The Claimants argue that,
although not a jurisdictional requirement, they have also satisfied the provision in the ECT
that provides that the parties attempt to amicably settle their dispute for a minimum three-
month period after the Claimants give notice of the dispute to the Respondent.?”> Before
commencing this arbitration, the Claimants sent the two Amicable Settlement Letters to

to the GSE Agreements in this arbitration.?”* Fourth, the Respondent submits that it has

Following the Achmea decision and the subsequent EU Declaration on Achmea, the
Respondent submitted its Request for Termination. The Respondent renewed its request
for immediate termination of the proceedings following the submission by Germany and
Austria of their notices to the Tribunal pursuant to the EU Declaration on Achmea. Since
the Request for Termination is based on the EU Declaration on Achmea, which relates to
the ECJ’s decision in Achmea, it will be discussed following the Tribunal’s analysis of that

decision.

Because the EC’s amicus curiae submissions on the issue of intra-EU disputes overlap with
those of the Respondent, the Tribunal will only set these out to the extent the EC’s position
varies from that of the Respondent and where those submissions provide insight on matters

relevant to this dispute.

dd) Have the Claimants established that the requirements for jurisdiction under
the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention have been met? (Issue 1.1)
The Claimants submit that requirements for jurisdiction under the ECT and Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention have clearly been met and that, as a result, the Tribunal has
jurisdiction to determine their claims under the ECT. The Respondent does not contest this
analysis; its jurisdictional objections relate to its interpretation of the ECT, which it says

does not grant the Tribunal jurisdiction to determine intra-EU disputes.

a. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal confirms that the requirements for jurisdiction on the face of the ECT and
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention have been met in this case. Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention provides:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out

of an investment, between a Contracting State ... and a national of another

Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to
the Centre.

Article 1(7) of the ECT similarly defines “Investor” to be “a company or other organisation

organised in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.”

ESPF is incorporated in the Federal Republic of Germany and ICE 5 is also established
under those laws while ESPF 2 is incorporated in the Republic of Austria.?*° Thus, the
Claimants meet the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(7)

of the ECT, as they are nationals of Germany and Austria.

Germany and Austria are both Contracting Parties to the ECT and Contracting States of
the ICSID Convention. At the time of their Memorial, the Claimants owned 100% of the
investments related to their PV facilities in Italy. They also owned these investments on
the date of their consent to ICSID jurisdiction and immediately before the events giving
rise to this dispute. The Claimants are covered Investors of a Contracting Party to the ECT

and a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.

The Respondent is also a Contracting Party to the ECT and a Contracting State to the ICSID

Convention.

The Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration on 29 January 2016 and provided their
consent in writing to ICSID arbitration pursuant to ECT Article 26(4), which provides that
“[iJn the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution ... the Investor

shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to ... (a)(i) the

International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ... if the Contracting Party of
the Investor and the Contracting Party party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID

Convention.”

For its part, the Respondent gave its “unconditional consent” to the submission of disputes
to ICSID arbitration in Article 26(3) of the ECT, which serves as the necessary consent

under the ICSID Convention.

Further, the dispute in this case arises directly out of an investment, as defined in

Article 1(6) of the ECT.

The Claimants’ claims relate to guarantees and protections contained in Article 10(1) of
the ECT, including the requirement to treat the Claimants’ investments fairly and equitably,
the prohibition against unreasonable or discriminatory measures that impair the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments; and the requirement
to observe any obligations entered into with an investment or an investor. The dispute is
thus a legal dispute arising out of the Claimants’ protected investments under Part III of

the ECT.

The Tribunal finds that the Claimants have established prima facie jurisdiction under the

ECT and ICSID Convention.

(2) Applicability of the ECT to Intra-EU Disputes and the Achmea Decision
(Issue 1.2)

a. The Respondent’s Arguments on whether the ECT applies to intra-EU
disputes

The Respondent advances three principal arguments with respect to its first ground for lack

of jurisdiction.

First, the Respondent claims that the ECT has never applied to intra~-EU disputes. The
Respondent argues that this was the Contracting Parties’ intention at the time they
concluded the ECT and that this intent emerges from the express wording and clear

language of the ECT.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 90

223. Second, the Respondent asserts that even if the ECT applied to intra-EU disputes at one

time, this is no longer the case after the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty.

224. Third, the Respondent submits that the Achmea Decision confirms the lack of jurisdiction
of arbitral tribunals under Article 26 of the ECT in intra-EU disputes.?*! Further, the
Respondent now argues that, as a result of its Request for Termination, the Tribunal should

terminate the proceedings immediately.

225. For the Respondent, “what is at stake is to what extent the EU and EU Member States
bound themselves signing the ECT. The issue is one of intent.”**? The Respondent argues
that Article 25 of the ECT explicitly recognizes the EU, as an economic integration
agreement (“EIA”), has the scope of “substantially liberalizing ... trade and investment,”
in much the same way as the ECT.*? On this basis, the Respondent asserts that Article
25 of the ECT recognizes “the understanding that between Contracting Parties that are
party to the EU, a ‘preferential treatment’ does exist and is fully recognized by the ECT.”
The Respondent contends that Article 25 recognizes “not only that rules of a EIA prevail
and are recognized by the ECT, but that also their further implementation by second
measures is ‘either at the entry into force of that agreement or on the basis of a reasonable
time frame’.”?5

226. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent adopts the EC’s argument from its Amicus Brief about the
existence of an implicit disconnection clause in the ECT which makes it inapplicable
between EU Member States stating that it “cannot affirm that the absence of a specific

exclusion [i.e. a disconnection clause] should amount to a declaration of wide application.

Member States at that time considered that there was no need for such an express

p 9923
reference.”?*°

The Respondent contends that maintaining the ECT’s arbitration regime would result in

“an intolerable discrimination among citizens of the Union.”?*7

On the basis of Article 16 of the ECT, which sets out the rules governing another
international agreement involving the same parties and subject matter, the Respondent
advances a primacy of EU law argument that EU law prevailed over the ECT at the time
of its conclusion.?** Article 16 provides as follows:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international

agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in
either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any
provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute
resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate
from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute

resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,

where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.

According to the Respondent, under Article 16 of the ECT, the Lisbon Treaty must prevail
over the terms of the ECT.?*° The Respondent asserts that EU law is “doubtless more
favourable to the investor,” since it is a more developed and complex legal system than
that in the ECT.? The Respondent claims that EU treaties are more favourable to investors
because “EU law represents a more developed and articulated legal system” that “cannot
even be compared to the protection of rights that an international instrument such as the

ECT can guarantee.”?°! The Respondent alleges that investors “can address courts in the

Union for all issues that would arise in an ECT arbitration.”?°? The Respondent goes on to

discuss the rights guaranteed to investors under EU law.?”?

The Respondent further argues that Article 41 of the VCLT — which concerns two or more
(but not all) parties to a multilateral treaty modifying a treaty inter se, thereby “contracting
out” from the original agreement — does not prevent the EU Member States from agreeing
between themselves to modify the terms of the ECT when they signed the Lisbon Treaty.”
Article 41 of the VCLT (Agreements to Modify Multilateral Treaties Between Certain of
the Parties Only) provides as follows:

1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement

to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

(a) The possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty; or

(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under
the treaty or the performance of their obligations;

(i) Does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible

with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a
whole.

2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph I(a) the treaty otherwise provides, the
parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the
agreement and of the modification to the treaty for which it provides.

The Respondent argues that the Lisbon Treaty can be deemed as an inter se agreement
pursuant to Article 41 of the VCLT which modifies the ECT, because the Lisbon Treaty
reinforces “the treatment of investors and investments within the EU.” Further, by adopting
the Lisbon Treaty, “EU Member States did not affect by any means the enjoyment by the
other Contracting Parties of their rights under the ECT or the performance of their
obligations, nor has the potential to do so.””°> According to the Respondent, in light of
Article 16 of the ECT, “the Lisbon Treaty is a perfectly legitimate inter se agreement

derogating from the general rules of the ECT by reinforcing the treatment of investors and

investments within the EU.”?°° The Respondent suggests that the Lisbon Treaty “[does]
not affect by any means the enjoyment by the other [non-EU] Contracting Parties of their
rights under the ECT.”?°? The Respondent contends that Article 41(1)(a) of the VCLT
permits some parties to an agreement to enter into a second treaty by which they modify
the previous one as amongst themselves. The Respondent further contends that such
modification does not need to be notified to the other parties to the first treaty — the ECT

here — pursuant to Article 41(2) of the VCLT.?°*

The Respondent also contends that the ECT’s context and purpose support a conclusion
that it does not apply to intra-EU disputes. The Respondent refers to the “decisions”
annexed to the ECT regarding Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 of the ECT in support of its
assertion that the Contracting Parties only intended the ECT to apply to disputes involving
either non-EU investors against EU Member States or EU investors against non-EU

Member States.”””

With respect to the circumstances of the Contracting Parties’ adoption of the ECT, the
Respondent contends that it was primarily concluded to regulate relations between Europe

and Eastern Europe/the Soviet Union, and not intra-EU situations.*°°

The Respondent also refers to the EC’s 1992 Proposal for a Council Directive concerning
common rules for the internal market in electricity and its dispute resolution mechanism as
evidence of “the intention of the EU institutions and the EU Member States to regulate
intra-EU situations exclusively within the Internal Market rules.”*"! The Respondent relies
on Electrabel v. Hungary for the proposition that the EC, in signing the ECT, “accepted

the possibility of international arbitrations under the ECT, both between a non-EU investor

and an EU Member State or between an EU investor and a non-EU Member State, without

any distinction or reservation.”>™

In terms of the evolution of EU law and its effect on the ECT, the Respondent argues that
the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty prohibits the application of the ECT to intra-EU disputes
in light of the VCLT or, alternatively, Article 16 of ECT.*

The Respondent contends that, for the purposes of Articles 30(1), (3) and (4)(a) of the
VCLT, the Lisbon Treaty and the ECT share the “same subject-matter.”*°* The
Respondent’s position is that the analysis of whether the subject matter is the same “does
not of course require exact coincidence of provisions or even of objectives (they do not
have to ‘deal’ with the same subject-matter).”*°> Although the Respondent concedes that
the Lisbon Treaty does not deal with the promotion and protection of investments, in line
with a broad determination of “subject-matter,” the Respondent asserts that both the ECT

and the Lisbon Treaty “share the same efforts of [economic] integration.”>°°

b. The EC’s Arguments on whether the ECT applies to intra-EU disputes

The EC advances three principal arguments for why the Tribunal does not have

jurisdiction.

First, the EC argues that intra-EU application of the ECT violates EU law because Member
States were not competent to bind themselves inter se when they ratified the ECT.*°’ The
EC argues that applying the ECT to intra-EU disputes would violate Articles 3(2), 267 and
344 of the TFEU, and that inter se relations take precedence over express provisions of a

treaty.*°® The EC contends that EU Member States’ international capacity to consent to be

bound by a treaty is limited by the EU’s internal distribution of competences and that the
EU has had exclusive external competence in renewable electricity since it issued its first
EC Directive in 2001.*°° The EC thus argues that the Respondent has acted not in its own
capacity, but as an organ of the EU when it established or revised its support systems for
investment in the PV sector, and that it acted under its obligations under EC Directive
2009/28 and EU state aid law.?!° The EC relies on Article 3(2) of the TFEU, which
provides that the EU has exclusive competence for the conclusion of international
agreements that “might affect common [EU] rules or alter their scope.”?!! The EC also
argues that the EU’s internal market rules cover all aspects of an investment, including

substantive and judicial protection, and that the EU alone has competence over that field.*!?

The EC asserts that if the ECT created obligations between the Member States, those
obligations would violate the EU treaties and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU in
particular.*!> According to the EC, Article 344 of the TFEU does not permit the
Respondent to submit any ECT disputes to the Tribunal, as that article prevents EU
Member States from submitting a dispute “involving the interpretation or application of

the Treaties to a new dispute settlement structure outside the EU Treaties.”?!4

The EC’s position is that Article 344 of the TFEU covers investor-state disputes.*!> In
support of this assertion, the EC relies on Legal Opinions 2/13 and 1/91, which address the

obligation of EU Member States to resort to EU law dispute settlement procedures and the

In Article 344, Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation of the EU treaties to

ECJ’s desire to avoid interpretations of EU law that affect the allocation of responsibilities

defined in the EU Treaties, respectively.>!°

Second, the EC argues that EU law and the ECT should be interpreted harmoniously, with
the result that the Respondent never offered to arbitrate this dispute with the Claimants.*!”
The EC posits that the ordinary meaning of the ECT and its surrounding circumstances
demonstrate that it does not apply to intra-EU disputes. The EC goes on to argue that there
is an implied “disconnection clause” in the ECT which makes it inapplicable between EU
Member States.*!* The EC attempts to distinguish the application of the Charanne v. Spain,
RREEF v. Spain, Blusun v. Italy and Eiser v. Spain arbitral awards by claiming that the
tribunals in those cases relied exclusively on a 2008 article by Professor Christian Tietje.°!
The EC submits that it excluded disputes from EU investors against a Member State in its
notification to the ECT Secretariat, which provides for the EC and Member States to
“determine among them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings initiated by
an Investor of another Contracting Party.”*?? The EC argues that the word “another

Contracting Party” “clearly excludes disputes brought by EU investors against a Member

State.”2?!

The EC further argues that the EU Member States decided not to include a disconnection
clause in the WTO-related treaties because they do not use that framework for intra~EU
matters and acted as “one single block” “throughout the negotiations.”*** The EC contends

that because the ECT recognizes certain Regional Economic Integration Organizations

(This is without prejudice to the right of the investor to initiate proceedings against both the Communities and their

(“REIO”) that enter into obligations among themselves, and because the EU is an REIO,
this recognition establishes exclusivity within those REIOs, rendering the ECT
inapplicable to them. The EC asserts that “[i]t was never intended that the ECT should

influence their internal energy policy.”*?>

Third, the EC argues that if harmonious interpretation is impossible, EU law should apply,
rather than the ECT.**4 According to the EC, the ECT is superseded by EU law through
Articles 30 and 41 of the VCLT and Article 351 of the TFEU.

The EC’s arguments regarding its request that the proceedings be suspended pending the
ECJ’s Achmea Decision have been rendered moot by the passage of time, thus the Tribunal

will not set these out here.

ec. The Claimants’ Arguments on whether the ECT applies to intra-EU
disputes
The Claimants assert that the Respondent’s arguments regarding the non-applicability of

the ECT to intra-EU disputes are wrong, and are refuted by:

e the explicit terms of the ECT, which have remained static since the Treaty
entered into force for Italy, Germany and Austria, and which contains no

implied “disconnection clause” in order to avoid purported conflicts with EU

law:325

© consistent investment treaty jurisprudence, applying the terms of the ECT in the

manner the Claimants suggest, which has unanimously rejected the intra-EU

objection;*”° and

246. The Claimants contend that the EC’s arguments are equally unpersuasive for the same

2
reasons.>7*

247. First, the Claimants contest the Respondent’s assertion that “at the most” only “four to
five” tribunals have ruled against the intra-EU objection. Rather, the Claimants submit that
at least 29 investment treaty tribunals have rejected this argument, including seventeen
ECT tribunals.*”? The Claimants reject the Respondent’s contention that no Tribunal has
ever addressed all the issues under international law in those cases, “or the consistency of
the two treaties as for material provisions they apply.”?? To the contrary, say the
Claimants, “numerous tribunals” — including those in Novenergia v. Spain, Eiser v. Spain,
Blusun v. Italy — have unanimously determined that there is no inconsistency between
investment treaties and EU law and, that even if there were, investment treaties “clearly”
afford investors greater protection.**! For instance, the Novenergia v. Spain tribunal

observed that FET under the ECT does not exist in the EU legal order.***

248. Second, the Claimants argue that the Respondent mischaracterizes the scope of EU law
and Article 16 of the ECT with its assertion that EU law offers investors more favourable
treatment than the ECT.*** The Claimants’ position, supported by the ECJ’s Advocate

General’s Opinion, is that even when taken as a whole, EU law on investors’ substantive

Third, the Claimants contest the Respondent’s argument that the EU Member States
intended to modify the ECT when they signed the Lisbon Treaty, and that this interpretation
is not prevented by Article 41 of the VCLT.**> The Claimants submit that Article 41(b)(ii)
of the VCLT only permits modification if it “does not relate to a provision, derogation from
which is incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty
as a whole.”>*° The Claimants submit that derogation from the ECT would be incompatible,
given that the object and purpose of the Treaty is the protection of their substantive and
procedural rights.**’ The Claimants further assert that there is no discrimination caused by

the operation of the ECT within the EU.?°*

Finally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has not demonstrated that EU Member
States did not intend the ECT to apply to intra-EU disputes through an implied
disconnection clause by pointing to any source that suggests this was the EU Member
States’ understanding at the time.**? The Claimants also point out that the EC’s position
that intra-EU investment dispute is inconsistent with EU law is not shared by all EU
Member States and is also contrary to the opinion of the EU Advocate General’s opinion
in this respect.*4° In response to the EC’s contextual interpretation argument that the
Statement Submitted by the European Communities to the Secretariat of the Energy

Charter pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT “clearly excludes disputes brought by

quoting from that statement is misleading.**! That statement provides, in part, as follows:

... The European Communities and their Member States have both concluded the

Energy Charter Treaty and are thus internationally responsible for the fulfilment

of the igati ined therein, in with their respecti

competences.

The Communities and the Member States will, if necessary, determine among

them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings initiated by an

Investor of another Contracting Party. In such case, upon the request of the

Investor, the Communities and the Member States concerned will make such
determination within a period of 30 days.

The footnote in the statement to this last quoted sentence provides: “[t]his is without
prejudice to the right of the investor to initiate proceedings against both the Communities

and their Member States.”

d. The Respondent’s Arguments on Achmea

The Respondent argues that because EU law is part of international law, and the applicable
law to a dispute under the ECT is international law, it follows that EU law should be applied
as international treaty law.*4? The Respondent asserts that “there is no possible doubt” that
the ECT’s offer to arbitrate as between EU Member States is “exactly identical” to

Article 8 of the Slovak-Dutch BIT at issue in Achmea.* In support of its position, the

 

Respondent relies on a blog post by Professor Steffen Hindelang of the Freie Universitat
Berlin, who opines that investment disputes between EU Member States under the ECT

should not be treated differently from the situation addressed in Achmea.**

The Respondent asserts that the fact that the ECT is a multilateral treaty, and that the EU
itself is a Party, does not affect the bilateral nature of the offer to arbitrate at issue in this

case.*4° The Respondent argues that the Achmea Decision endorses its contention that intra-

EU investment arbitration violates Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU and the general
principle of the autonomy of EU law, and therefore an arbitration clause becomes

inapplicable when invoked by two EU Member States.*4°

254. The Respondent further argues that the ECJ’s statement in Achmea that the EU, when

entering into international treaties, has to “[respect] the autonomy of the EU and its legal
order”*4’ “necessarily entail[s] the power to submit disputes to the decisions of a court
created or designated by such agreements as for the interpretation and application ... of
such international agreements provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is

respected.”*4*

255. According to the Respondent, Achmea confirms that an offer to arbitrate between intra-EU
parties becomes inapplicable if the arbitration tribunal must apply EU law for two principal
reasons. First, arbitral tribunals cannot raise a preliminary ruling before the ECJ under
Article 267 of the TFEU, and therefore such tribunals breach the monopoly of the ECJ in
the interpretation of EU law and prevent those disputes from being resolved in accordance
with “the full effectiveness of EU law.”*4? The Respondent argues that this is so even
within the context of a multilateral treaty.**°

256. For the Respondent, intra~-EU investment arbitration under the ECT is incompatible with
EU law because it violates the autonomy of the EU legal order for the same reasons as the
intra-EU BIT at issue in Achmea.*>! The Respondent asserts it is possible to interpret the
ECT as not applying between EU Member States by looking to public international law
and, specifically, to the principle of interpretation “in conformity or of harmonious

interpretation” (pointing to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT and Electrabel v. Hungary).>? In

the alternative, if the clear wording precludes interpretation in conformity for being contra
legem, the Respondent argues that any conflict between the ECT and EU law would have
to be resolved in favour of EU law.*** The Respondent contends that Achmea resolves the
previous live issue for arbitral tribunals regarding not only with respect to whether intra-
EU BITs, but also intra-EU ECT situations, are incompatible with the TFEU, and cites a
blog post by Nikos Lavranos where he states that “it would seem that Achmea applies” in

intra-EU ECT disputes.***

257. Second, the Respondent states that Achmea concludes that arbitral tribunals are not
jurisdictions under the preliminary ruling procedure set out in Article 267 of the TFEU,
and that only state-established permanent jurisdictions qualify as such.*°> While the
Respondent acknowledges that “the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is derived from the express
terms of the ECT” and that it is “a binding treaty under international law,” it argues that
because the Tribunal is not part of the EU judicial system, and thus, as found in Achmea,

this Tribunal has no power to refer a reference to the ECJ for preliminary ruling.**°

258. In sum, for the Respondent, the ECT’s arbitration clause is incompatible with, and
adversely affects the autonomy of, EU law because arbitral tribunals are not capable of
ensuring the proper application and full effectiveness of EU law in intra-EU disputes on
account of their inability to refer a preliminary ruling to the ECJ and their lack of state-

established permanent jurisdiction.

259. The Respondent also argues that EU law offers “functionally more articulated” protection
to intra-EU investors than that in the ECT.**” It alleges that the ECT recognizes the EU as
a unified legal system whose provisions on the same matters covered in the ECT must

prevail, “and consequently that Contracting Parties signed the ECT under the mutual

understanding that this would not apply to intra-EU situation” so as not to infringe Article

344 TFEU, as stated in Achmea.**

The Respondent also contends that the Opinion by Advocate General Wathelet — which
assumes that arbitral tribunals could and, in some cases, are obliged to, raise preliminary
rulings before the ECJ — is superseded by Achmea, which noted that it was not bound by

this Opinion.*?

Finally, the Respondent argues that EU Member States are not permitted to execute awards
which infringe upon EU law irrespective of whether they are rendered pursuant to an EU
seat of arbitration or a non-EU jurisdiction, or alternatively, under ICSID or non-ICSID
rules.* The European Commission requires that intra-7EU ECT awards be authorized by
it before execution because such awards constitute state aids, which Respondent relies on

as further evidence of the institutional conflict caused by the ECT.*°!

e. The Claimants’ Arguments on Achmea

The Claimants assert that the Achmea Decision is irrelevant to the current dispute for

several reasons. *°

First, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is exclusively
based on the express terms of the ECT, namely Article 26 of the ECT, and that Article
26(6) of the ECT cannot be used as a “back door” for application of the Achmea

Decision.*

Second, the Claimants submit that at least 29 investment treaty decisions have now rejected
intra-EU objections, and that their reasoning for doing so remains resonant for three

reasons:*

e First, the Claimants observe that had the Contracting Parties to the ECT wanted
to exclude intra-EU disputes from the Treaty’s coverage, there were tools
available to achieve this carve-out — but they did not do so.*® The Claimants
state that tribunals have repeatedly held that interpretive gymnastics should not
be undertaken to read an intra-EU restriction into the ECT, when plainly no

such restriction exists in the language of the Treaty.*©°

e Second, the Claimants assert that EU law and the ECT do not share the same
subject matter, “not least because the ECT affords investors [with] a right to
international arbitration that is not included in the EU legal framework.”*°’ The
Claimants state that the ECJ suggested that Achmea did not extend to treaties to
which the EU is a contracting party, and this issue was addressed in the ECJ’s
Advocate General Wathelet, who stated that:

the material provisions for the protection of investments provided for in
that Treaty and the [investors-state dispute settlement] mechanism also
operate between Member States. | note that if no EU institution and no
Member State sought an opinion from the Court on the compatibility of

that treaty with the EU and FEU Treaties, that is because none of them
had the slightest suspicion that it might be incompatible.**

The ECJ did not rule that there was a conflict between EU law and the
substantive protections in the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, but rather that the BIT
violated jurisdictional protections of the EU treaties by interfering with the
ECJ’s authority.°° In any event, the Claimants point out that none of their
claims is based on EU law; rather, all claims are based on the ECT and public

international law.3”°

e Third, even if such a conflict existed, the Claimants argue that the ECT would

prevail over EU law pursuant to Article 16(2) of the ECT, which states that the

investor shall benefit from the more favourable provisions contained in the

ECT, explicitly including the “right to dispute resolution.”>”!

The Claimants submit that, even if Achmea were relevant, it is clearly distinguishable from

investment arbitrations under the ECT for two reasons:377

Achmea is limited to intra-EU BITs and does not apply to investment treaties to
which the EU is a party. There are 54 Contracting Parties to the ECT, and thus
25 states that are not EU Member States, and the EU itself. Thus the ECJ limited
its decision to BITs concluded between EU Member States. The ECJ “clearly
lacks the authority to derogate from a treaty to which non-EU states are
parties.”>7>

Achmea turned on governing law provisions in the BIT that are not present in
the ECT. Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT stated that the applicable
law included “the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned” “and other
relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties,” whereas Article 26(6)
of the ECT specifically provides that the Tribunal shall decide disputes in
accordance with the terms of the ECT and principles of international law.>”
The Claimants assert that the ECT does not permit the Tribunal to apply the
domestic law of the host state or other relevant agreements between the

Contracting Parties.>”5

The Claimants suggest caution in analysing Achmea’s theoretical future impact, if any,
upon enforcement of ECT arbitral awards, and asserts that this is not a relevant concern for

this Tribunal.37°

Sf The Tribunal’s Analysis

Although the Respondent made multiple objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the main
objection, supported by the Commission’s submissions and various interpretations of the
ECT, was that the arbitration agreement in the ECT does not apply to intra-EU disputes.
The Respondent submits that allowing investors from other EU member states, such as
Claimants in this case, to bring their claims before an international arbitral tribunal would
be antithetical to the nature of the EU and the fundamental principles of “unity, autonomy
and effectiveness” and mutual trust enshrined in the TFEU. The Respondent says that all
disputes between Member States of the EU should thus be resolved exclusively by courts

and tribunals of Member States.

For context before turning to each specific argument made by the Respondent in turn, the
Tribunal notes that this position reflects a change in preference of forum by European
States for the resolution of investor-State disputes. The system of investor-State dispute
resolution by international arbitral tribunals was created by States to address the issues
arising from investors having to seek redress in the courts of a State that had allegedly
imposed illegal measures and/or seeking the diplomatic protection of their home State.
Investment arbitration as we know it today is a system created by States in order to provide

a neutral forum for the resolution of investment disputes and thereby encourage investment.

States specifically selected international arbitration as an appropriate means to resolve
investment disputes and created the possibility for covered investors to commence
proceedings directly. Arbitration is a consensual but binding dispute resolution

mechanism; once consent has been given and the offer to arbitrate accepted, it cannot be

unilaterally withdrawn by either party to a dispute. The agreement of the parties to arbitrate

their disputes is fundamental to arbitration and forms the basis for a tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Through investment treaties made with each other, host States gave their consent to
international arbitration. States agreed to directly resolve their disputes with investors for
alleged breaches of the investment treaty in a neutral forum that would apply international

law (and, sometimes, consider national laws).

The ECT is an example of such an investment treaty. Its object and purpose is “to promote

q7377

long-term cooperation in the energy fiel and it protects the substantive and procedural

rights of investors in the territory of other States signatory to the ECT. To this point, there
is no dispute. The Respondent accepts that the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction from the
ECT, which is a binding international treaty.*”* The provisions of Article 26 of the ECT
that relate to consent to arbitration and its binding nature are found in Part III of the ECT

and are set out here:

(3)(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby
gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international
arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

(b)(i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such
unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the
dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).

(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in
Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and
conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the
deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in
accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in
accordance with Article 41.

(c) A Contracting Party listed in Annex IA does not give such unconditional
consent with respect to a dispute arising under the last sentence of Article
10(1).

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution [by
international arbitration or conciliation], the Investor shall further provide its
consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

The Respondent does not rely on either of the explicit exceptions set out in Article 26(3)(b)
or (c).>” Instead, despite the clear wording of Article 26 providing “unconditional consent”
to international arbitration, the Respondent (and the Commission) argue that the EU
Member States signatory to the ECT never intended the arbitration agreement to apply to
disputes between them. In the alternative, the Respondent submits that the Lisbon Treaty,
subsequently entered into among the EU member States, is an inter se agreement for the
purposes of Article 41 of the VCLT that vitiates the Respondent’s consent to arbitration

given in the ECT as it relates to investors from other EU member States.

Further, the Respondent submits that in the Achmea decision, the ECJ specifically decided
the issue of the validity of intra-EU arbitration agreements in the negative. The Respondent
says that the subsequent Declarations by the EU Member States, including the EU Member
States party to the ECT relevant in this arbitration (both the home and host States), are
determinative and justify its request to terminate the arbitral proceedings. The Respondent
submits that the Tribunal is “bound by the will of the Contracting Parties,” which it says is
expressed in the Declarations and should be taken into account pursuant to Articles

31(2)(b) and 31(3)(a) of the VCLT.

As the instrument that gives rise to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this arbitration, the
Tribunal’s analysis in the following sections of this award will focus on the text of the
ECT. The relevant provisions of the ECT will be interpreted in accordance with the rules

of customary international law as codified in the VCLT.

The Tribunal notes that the Commission has referred to its statement made pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii)

setting out its “policies, practices and conditions with regard to disputes” to support its argument that the EU Member
States did not intend to give consent to international arbitration among EU Member States. This was not a reliance on
the exceptions directly, which do not in any case apply. The exceptions relate to disputes “previously submitted” “to
the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute” or “in accordance with any
applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure,” neither of which apply in this case.

The preamble to the VCLT confirms that “the principles of free consent and of good faith
and the pacta sunt servanda tule are universally recognized” and States’ desire “to establish
conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties can be
maintained.” The operative terms of the VCLT address, inter alia, the capacity of States to
enter into treaties; how States express their consent to be bound by the terms of treaties (or
their specific reservations to certain terms) and how that consent may be modified or
withdrawn; and how treaties should be interpreted. The VCLT supports clarity in the
obligations voluntarily assumed by States through treaties by giving effect to the treaty
language negotiated by the State parties and making clear what evidence is required in

order for States to be bound.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is important that international law as expressed in treaties is
capable of being known and is certain. This is of fundamental importance to States, as well
as all international actors affected by such treaties. State sovereignty is guarded by this, as
States negotiate and choose how to express their agreed limits to their sovereignty. It is
also important for other international actors who rely on treaties that the terms of such
treaties be clear and the obligations assumed to be certain. These principles are of

fundamental importance to the rule of law.

For the reasons articulated below, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to determine

the Claimants’ claims under the ECT.

(i) The Original Scope of the ECT and whether it includes an Express or
Implied Disconnection Clause

The Respondent’s first argument is that the ECT has never applied to intra-EU disputes.

The Respondent says that the ECT’s context and purpose support a conclusion that it does
not apply to intra-EU disputes; it was primarily concluded to regulate relations between
Europe and Eastern Europe/the Soviet Union.**° The Respondent refers to the definitions

of “Contracting Party,” “regional economic integration organisation,” and “Area,” as well

as recognition in the ECT of the relations among EU Member States in Articles 25 and 16,

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, | 64.

Award
Page 111

in support of its contextual analysis. The Respondent also refers to the “decisions” annexed
to the ECT regarding Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 of the ECT in support of this argument.**!
For convenience, the relevant provisions of Articles 24 and Article 25 of the ECT are set

out here:

Article 24(4)

The provisions of this Treaty which accord most favoured nation treatment shall
not oblige any Contracting Party to extend to the Investors of any other
Contracting Party any preferential treatment:

(a) resulting from its membership of a free-trade area or customs union; ...
Article 25

(1) The provisions of this Treaty shall not be so construed as to oblige a
Contracting Party which is party to an Economic Integration Agreement
(hereinafter referred to as “EIA”) to extend, by means of most favoured nation
treatment, to another Contracting Party which is not a party to that EIA, any
preferential treatment applicable between the parties to that EIA as a result of their
being parties thereto.

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), “ELA” means an agreement substantially
liberalising, inter alia, trade and investment, by providing for the absence or
elimination of substantially all discrimination between or among parties thereto
through the elimination of existing discriminatory measures and/or the prohibition
of new or more discriminatory measures, either at the entry into force of that
agreement or on the basis of a reasonable time frame.”

(3)...

The Claimants point out that it is not altogether clear that the EU is “an EIA, free trade
area, or customs union”**? but, in any event, nothing in the ECT or the Decisions referenced
therein supports the Respondent’s interpretation that EU investors are prohibited from

seeking redress in international arbitration against an EU Member State.

The Respondent says that the ECT explicitly recognizes the EU as a REIO with a similar
goal to the ECT of liberalizing trade and investment. Article 25 of the ECT recognizes
different (preferential) treatment among parties to an EIA. Italy interprets this to mean that

the Parties recognized that ECT members who were also EU members would have

preferential treatment by virtue of the EIA and that further implementation by second

measures was contemplated at the time.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s argument to this point is supported by the text of
the ECT. The EU and its Member States are Contracting Parties to the ECT. The EU signed
the ECT as a REIO and the ECT contemplates further evolution of the EU’s trade and
investment rules among the parties to an EIA (irrespective of whether the EU Treaties are
an EIA as defined in the ECT). However, Article 25 of the ECT does not address the issue

of the obligations owed by one EU Member to the investors of another EU Member.

If it applies to the EU, Article 25 of the ECT addresses the obligations of EU Member
States to non-members and provides that there is no obligation “to extend, by means of
most favoured nation treatment, ... any preferential treatment applicable between the
parties to that EIA as a result of their being parties thereto.” Article 25 of the ECT makes
clear that the contracting parties to an EIA could make arrangements as between
themselves to liberalize trade and investment and that non-members of that EIA could not
benefit from those arrangements through the ECT. In effect, these provisions address the
opposite situation to the one at issue in this case. These provisions confirm that any
preferential treatment agreed within the EU would not have to be extended to non-EU

members.

Nevertheless, the Respondent relies on Article 25 of the ECT for the proposition that the
EU’s purpose (through an EIA) is to substantially liberalize trade and investment and that
this is “the same subject matter as the ECT.”>*? The Respondent also refers to the Decision
on Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 as further support for its interpretation, arguing that the
wording of this decision providing that an Investment of an Investor with its registered

office in the Area of the party to an EIA is to be treated as a party to that EIA.***

In addition, Italy says that Article 16 of the ECT supports its argument that EU law

prevailed over the ECT at the time of its conclusion.>*°

The Respondent submits that the relevant Contracting Parties in this case (Italy, Germany
and Austria) had entered into the EU treaties before entering into the ECT and that the EU
treaties “concern the subject matter of Part III or V of [the ECT].” As a result, it says that
“nothing in Part III or V of the ECT must be construed to derogate from any provision of
the EU Treaties as for investment promotion and protection, or from any right to dispute
resolution with respect thereto under the EU Treaties.”**° The Respondent argues that the
rights granted under the EU Treaties are more favourable and goes further to argue in effect
that Article 16 of the ECT provides that those rights replace any rights granted to other EU
Member States under the ECT.

The Tribunal does not consider this interpretation of Article 16 to be supported by the text.
While Article 16 does address the coincidence of rights arising from international
agreements concerning the same subject matter of Part III or V of the ECT, the language
of the provision confirms the intention that any such rights have an additive, rather than
substitutive effect. The alternatives in Article 16 make it clear that the Contracting Parties
accepted that there were already (“prior”) and could in future be (“subsequent”)
international agreements among some of the Contracting Parties that concerned investment
protection and promotion (Part III) and dispute settlement (Part V) (an obvious example
being bilateral investment treaties). Article 16 provides for the rights granted under the
various international agreements to both co-exist and be operative. Otherwise, there would
have been no need to provide a “conflict rule” that relates to the construction of both

agreements.

The clear intention of Article 16 was to ensure that Investors or Investments would have
access to the “more favourable” applicable provision. Article 16 is intended to preserve the
maximum rights available to an Investor or an Investment, not to create a situation where

one international agreement’s regime has primacy over the other. Said differently, the

Contracting Parties agreed that they could not derogate from the substantive protections
afforded by either international agreement to which they are parties to the detriment of the

Investor or the Investment.

That is not to say that rights granted under other international agreements could be
imported into the ECT. Each agreement stands on its own. Article 16 of the ECT simply
grants a minimum level of protection to Investors and Investments by confirming that the
substantive rights granted could not be derogated from through the interpretation of the
provisions in another international agreement. This follows from the language of Article
16 of the ECT, which links the method of dispute resolution to the substantive right
asserted. In both Article 16(1) and (2), the reference is to “any right to dispute resolution
with respect thereto under [the relevant agreement].” Any disputes as to the provisions of
Part III or V of the ECT are to be resolved pursuant to the rights to dispute resolution under

the ECT.

The language of Article 16 of the ECT also confirms that the Contracting Parties were
cognizant of the fact that multiple instruments could give rise to rights for the same investor
and that in such situations it would be the Investor or the Investment who would select
which protection and associated dispute resolution mechanism to pursue. This flows from
the language and structure of Article 16 of the ECT, which confirms that there may be
multiple agreements that create rights and that the provision in the instrument that is “more
favourable to the Investor or Investment” shall prevail. When this provision is read together
with Article 26(2) of the ECT, which grants the right to an Investor to choose to submit a
dispute for resolution, it is clear that the Contracting Parties intended that the Investor select
the instrument and related dispute resolution mechanism under which it would pursue its

rights.

In the Tribunal’s view, these provisions of the ECT do not support the Respondent’s
proposed interpretation; the ECT’s provisions do not indicate the intention of the
Contracting Parties to exclude or exempt intra-EU disputes over claims that arise under the

ECT.

293.

Further, the “context” that these provisions provide cannot be interpreted to indicate that
EU parties did not see a need for a specific disconnection clause. To recap, Italy and the
EU argue that “at the time” Member States did not see a need for an explicit disconnection
clause and that the lack of such a clause should not be interpreted as an intention to include
such disputes. As a result, the Respondent’s argument (supported by the EC) that the ECT’s
context and purpose can be used to interpret the ECT dispute resolution provision as

applying only between non-Member states must fail.

The Tribunal must interpret the ECT pursuant to the VCLT and in light of the VCLT’s
object and purpose. The wording of the ECT dispute resolution provisions is clear — an
Investor may bring a claim against a State party in international arbitration and there are
no specific exceptions. Article 6 of the VCLT specifically states that “[e]very State
possesses capacity to conclude treaties.” Article 42 of the VCLT also confirms that “the
consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application
of the present Convention.” Context and purpose cannot be used to override the clear
wording of a treaty. The general rule of interpretation is that a “treaty shall be interpreted
in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty

in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”

Read as a whole, the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT is that all of the
Contracting Parties consented to international arbitration with investors from all other
Contracting Parties unless the specific exceptions therein were met. To achieve this result,
the language in Article 26(3) goes so far as to indicate that Contracting Parties seeking to
avail themselves of the exceptions to that unconditional consent “[for the sake of
transparency] ... provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this
regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification

. [or] accession.” The Contracting Parties expressly intended that any exceptions to the
unconditional consent to international arbitration or conciliation be transparent and

articulated before the ECT was in force. To override this clear wording and arrive at the

Award
Page 116

conclusion that the EU and its Member States did not intend for this consent to apply inter

se, an explicit disconnection clause would be required.>*’

With respect to the EC’s argument that EU Member States did not have the competence to
provide for international arbitration inter se, the Tribunal agrees with the analysis of the
Blusun v. Italy tribunal, which stated that “[t]he inter se obligations in the ECT are not
somehow invalid or inapplicable because of an allocation of competence that the EC says
can be inferred from a set of EU laws and regulations dealing with investment. The more
likely explanation, consistent with the text of the ECT, is that, at the time the ECT was
signed, the competence was a shared one.”*** This is supported by the fact that both the
EC and the EU Member States were Contracting Parties, which indicates the intention that,
together, all signatories had all of the necessary competences to agree to the obligations
contained in the ECT. This is consistent with the Communities’ own statement to the
Energy Charter Secretariat at the time that they and their Member States have both
concluded the ECT “and are thus internationally responsible for the fulfilment of the

obligations contained therein, in accordance with their respective competences.”>*?

In the Tribunal’s view, this confirms that the Contracting Parties intended all of the
provisions of the ECT to be binding on all of the Contracting Parties and that together, the
EC and its Member States had competence to agree to be bound by all of the provisions of
the ECT. Thus, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion, as other tribunals have also reached,
that EU Member States and the EU are all Contracting Parties to the ECT and, as such, the

Treaty applies equally between its Parties.*°°

The Tribunal rejects the Respondent and the EC’s explanation that the EU and the EU
Member States did not include a disconnection clause in the ECT because they acted as

“one single block” throughout its negotiation, and therefore did not think it necessary. This

The Tribunal notes that the ECT contains at least one such example in its references to the Svalbard Treaty.

position is not supported by the text of the ECT, which suggests overlapping competence

and not an “indivisible whole.”*!

The Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the Blusun v. Italy tribunal and finds that reading
(an implied) disconnection clause into the ECT “is not permissible in a context in which
the terms of the treaty are clear.”?°? In accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, the ECT
is to be interpreted in good faith, according to the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms
used in that treaty, in their context and taking into account the object and purpose of the
treaty. Applying this means of interpretation, the Tribunal finds no basis to suggest that the
Contracting Parties to the ECT intended to include an implicit disconnection clause that

would apply to intra-EU disputes. The Respondent’s objection on this ground is dismissed.

Further, the ECT’s preamble explicitly records its intention to make the commitments
contained in the 1991 European Energy Charter (“EEC”)*” binding, thereby implying that
the scope of the EEC “was replicated in binding form in the ECT.”** This Tribunal agrees
with the Blusun v. Italy Tribunal’s observation that there is no indication of any inter se
exclusion in the EEC, which instead refers to a “European-wide and global co-operation
based on mutual respect” and “support from the [EU] ... through completion of its internal

energy market.”

(ii) The Respondent's Primacy of EU Law Argument and the Relationship
between Articles 16 and 26 of the ECT
As a corollary to its first argument, the Respondent invokes Article 16 of the ECT (which
sets out the conflict rules regarding other international agreements involving the same
parties and subject matter) in support of its contention that EU law prevailed over the ECT

at the time of its conclusion. The Respondent claims that EU treaties are more favourable

to investors, and that EU law is more developed and articulated than the protections under
the ECT such that investors could address in an EU court all issues that would arise in ECT

arbitration.

The Claimants counter that the Respondent mischaracterizes the scope of EU law and
Article 16 of the ECT, and that the ECT in fact offers investors more favourable treatment
than the ECT, such as fair and equitable treatment, which does not exist in the EU legal

order.°°°

As set out above, Article 16 of the ECT does not create a hierarchy among international
agreements. Instead, it contemplates that rights under multiple agreements may exist and
that, in such circumstances, the Investor may choose which rights to pursue and how. A
determination of which of these provisions and its related means of dispute settlement is
more favourable to the Investor can only be effectively made once the circumstances giving

rise to the dispute arise.

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent is bound by Article 26, pursuant to which it has

given unconditional consent to arbitration before an international tribunal.

(iii)Purported Subsequent Modification of the ECT as to Inter Se Matters

The Respondent’s second argument is that, even if the ECT applied to intra-EU disputes at
the time of its conclusion, the EU Member States intended to modify the ECT when
subsequently they signed the Lisbon Treaty. The Respondent suggests that Article 41 of
the VCLT does not prevent EU Member States from agreeing inter se modifications to the
ECT by way of the Lisbon Treaty, particularly where maintaining the ECT’s arbitration

regime would result in discrimination among EU citizens.

In response to this argument, the Claimants first note that the Respondent’s arguments in
this regard presuppose that the EU Member States intended to modify the ECT when they

entered into the Lisbon Treaty and there is no evidence of this intention.*”’ The Claimants

also point out that Article 41(b)(ii) of the VCLT only permits modifications to existing
treaties if it “does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible with the
effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole.”*°* Moreover, the
Claimants submit that inter se modifications cannot be accepted where they are

unsupported by express provision or clear understanding to the contrary.*””

The Respondent supports its argument of its intention to modify the ECT through the
Lisbon Treaty by contending that maintaining the ECT’s arbitration regime would result
in “an intolerable discrimination among citizens of the Union.”*°° As the Claimants have
noted, the ECT and EU treaties address discrimination within the context of a state’s
treatment of foreign — not domestic —investors and, as such, there is no discrimination
caused by the operation of the ECT between EU Member States.*°! The Tribunal agrees
that the Respondent’s argument as to the alleged discriminatory effect of the ECT’s
arbitration regime is incorrect on the face of the clear wording of the ECT, which does not

share the same scope as the EU Treaties.

The Tribunal has found that intra-EU dispute resolution was not exempted from the
application of Article 26 of the ECT at the time that treaty was entered into. The inquiry
now shifts to whether the EU Member States subsequently modified the terms of the ECT
with respect to intra-EU dispute resolution. The Respondent relies on Article 41 of the

VCLT and asserts that the Lisbon Treaty, in particular, was intended to modify the ECT.

States are free to agree to amend or modify treaties and the VCLT outlines the rules for
doing so effectively. The ability of some States to modify a multilateral treaty to which
they and others are parties (such as the EU Member States purporting to modify the ECT)
after it has been concluded is addressed by Article 41 of the VCLT. When doing so, States
are limited to modifications that are not prohibited by the treaty, do not affect the enjoyment

by the other parties of their rights under the treaty or the performance of their obligations

and do not derogate from provisions that relate to the effective execution of the object and
purpose of the treaty as a whole. Article 41(2) also requires notification of the “other parties
of their intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the treaty for which

it provides.”

The Lisbon Treaty grants to the EU a new competence over foreign direct investment.
However, EU law, either in the Lisbon Treaty or elsewhere, does not provide for
international arbitration between an investor and a host state. In addition, EU law does not
grant investors the same substantive protections granted in Part III of the ECT, in particular
fair and equitable treatment. This suggests that the Lisbon Treaty was not intended to be
“an agreement to modify the [ECT] as between themselves alone,” as contemplated by
Article 41 of the VCLT. The Lisbon Treaty addresses energy specifically, but there is no

reference made to the ECT in the Lisbon Treaty*”

and it is common ground that there is
no equivalent in EU law of Article 26 of the ECT.*°? One would expect that States
intending to modify a treaty with a subsequent agreement would at least refer to it; a clear
intention is required to do so pursuant to Article 41(2). In addition, such intention must be
notified. Article 41(2) requires parties purporting to modify a treaty inter se to “notify the
other parties of their intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the

treaty for which it provides.” Neither the EU nor its Member States expressed such an

intention, much less notified it as required.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the EU Member States did not agree to modify the

ECT as between themselves when they concluded the Lisbon Treaty.

In addition to the Lisbon Treaty, the Respondent refers to the EC’s 1992 Proposal for a
Council Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and its

dispute resolution mechanism as evidence of the EU and its Member States to regulate

The Lisbon Treaty does expressly indicate that it amends “the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty

This issue has been considered by tribunals previously and the Parties did not take issue with this point. See,

intra-EU situations exclusively within the Internal Market rules.*”* The Tribunal finds that
the rules establishing the EU’s internal market are arguably broader than those in the ECT,
while still being complementary to them. As the tribunal in Blusun v. Italy held, “[t]here is
no discrimination unless the same benefits are not accorded to other EU States, but there
is nothing in the ECT that requires such a result.”4°° The Respondent relies on Electrabel
v. Hungary for the proposition that the EC, in signing the ECT, only agreed to international
arbitration when one of the parties was a non-EU Member State. That reliance is misplaced.
In stating that the EU “accepted the possibility of international arbitrations under the ECT,
both between a non-EU investor and an EU Member State or between an EU investor and
a non-EU Member State, without any distinction or reservation,”*°° the Electrabel v.
Hungary tribunal did not define the limits of the EU’s consent to arbitration. Rather, the
Electrabel v. Hungary tribunal observed that EU law can be presumed not to conflict or

otherwise be inconsistent with the ECT.*°”

(iv) The EC’s Amicus Curiae Arguments
First, the EC argues that the intra-EU application of the ECT violates EU law — specifically,
Articles 3(2), 267, and 344 of the TFEU — because the EU Member States were not
competent to bind themselves inter se when they ratified the ECT.*°* The EC contends that
Article 344 of the TFEU covers investor-state disputes. Article 344 of the TFEU provides
as follows:
Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or

application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided
for therein.“

The Tribunal finds that Article 344 of the TFEU does not exclude the possibility of

referring intra-EU investor-state disputes to international arbitration not contemplated in

the EU treaties.*!° Rather, Article 344 of the TFEU merely prohibits EU Member States
from submitting inter-state disputes regarding the interpretation and application of EU law
to dispute settlement not provided for in the EU treaties.*!! Article 344 of the TFEU does
not address individuals’ rights, including an investor’s right to resolve disputes against a
host State. The dispute in this case also does not involve the interpretation or application

of the EU treaties; the Claimants have brought claims under the ECT.

Second, the EC argues that the ECT is superseded by EU law through Articles 30 and 41 of
the VCLT and Article 351 of the TFEU, which it says mandates the primacy of EU law in
relation to international agreements. According to the EC, EU law should apply rather than

422 Here

the ECT where harmonious interpretation of these two legal orders is impossible.
too, the Tribunal cannot follow this line of argument. The Tribunal disagrees that specific
provisions of the ECT are incompatible with EU law and therefore cannot be applied, with
the result that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear this case. The conflict rules in Article
30(3) of the VCLT read as follows:

When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the

earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under Article 59, the

earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with
those of the latter treaty.

Article 351 of the TFEU provides that the EU treaties do not affect the international
agreements of Member States assumed before a State’s accession to the EU:

The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January

1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or

more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the
other, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Treaties.

Article 30(3) of the VCLT deals with the priority between particular provisions of an earlier
and a later treaty, as opposed to Article 59 of the VCLT which concerns the termination of

an entire treaty. Article 59 of the VCLT requires that the earlier treaty be so incompatible

with the later treaty that both cannot be applied at the same time, which is not the case here.
EU law is limited to inter-state disputes concerning the interpretation and application of
EU law, which does not extend to investor-state arbitration under the ECT. There is
therefore no question of incompatibility which would justify reliance on Article 30(3) of

the VCLT.4!3

Article 351 of the TFEU applies only to States, which the Claimants in the present case are
not. Further, this provision applies only between EU Member States and non-Member
States, and here Germany, Austria, and Italy are all EU Member States.*!4 The Tribunal

does not see how Article 351 of the TFEU applies, and therefore rejects this argument.

The Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from the line of ECT cases that have repeatedly
taken the view that, absent an express disconnection clause or an express modification of

the ECT, the offer to arbitrate is valid as between EU Member States and their Investors.

(v) Applicability of the Achmea Decision to this ECT Dispute

Based, in part, on its argument of the primacy of EU law, the Respondent submits that the
decision of the ECJ in the Achmea case is determinative of the issue of whether it had the
competence to consent to international arbitration with an investor from an EU Member
State. Subsequent to the decision of the ECJ, a number of EU Member States issued the
Declaration, which the Respondent submits confirms the agreement of the EU Member
States to “inform investment arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences of the
Achmea judgment, as set out in this declaration, in all pending intra-EU investment
arbitration proceedings brought either under bilateral investment treaties concluded
between member States or under the Energy Charter Treaty.”4!5 Pursuant to the
Declaration, Germany and Austria both submitted letters advising this Tribunal of the

Declaration.

It is for this Tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction under the ECT. In doing so, it is
necessary to consider (as it already has) the provisions of the ECT itself, as well as whether
there has been any subsequent modification of those provisions. The Tribunal’s conclusion
after performing this analysis is that it does have jurisdiction. The ECT contains an

investor-State arbitration clause applicable between EU Member States.

The Respondent now argues that the EU Declaration on Achmea, which arises from the EU
Member States’ obligation to “draw all necessary consequences from [the Achmea]
judgment pursuant to their obligations under Union law,” confirms the agreement of the
parties that:

Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between

Member States. As a consequence, all investor-State arbitration clauses contained

in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to

Union law and thus inapplicable...An arbitral tribunal established on the basis of

investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer

to arbitrate by the Member State party of the underlying bilateral investment

Treaty.

Furthermore, international agreements concluded by the Union, including the

Energy Charter Treaty, are an integral part of the EU legal order and must

therefore be compatible with the Treaties. Arbitral tribunals have interpreted the

Energy Charter Treaty as also containing an investor-State arbitration clause

applicable between Member States. Interpreted in such a manner, that clause
would be incompatible with the Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied.

In order to address these latest submissions, the Tribunal will examine first whether it is
“bound by the will of the Contracting Parties” in their interpretation of intra-EU arbitration
provisions such that the Declaration deprives it of its jurisdiction under the ECT. If not, the
Tribunal will examine the content of the Declaration itself and the ECJ’s decision in
Achmea that gave rise to the Declaration to determine whether the ECJ’s reasoning applies

to this case.

The Respondent submits that the fact that the Declaration is signed by all three EU Member
States involved in this arbitration (Germany, Austria and Italy) is determinative; the
Tribunal is bound by their “will” and must take the Declaration “into account in conformity
with Article 31(2)(b) VCLT and Article 31(3)(a) VCLT.” The EU Declaration on Achmea
relied upon by the Respondent has not been agreed by all EU Member States.

Article 31 of the VCLT relates to the general rule of interpretation of a treaty. Article
31(2)(b) allows “any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with
the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to
the treaty” to be considered as part of the context for the purpose of interpretation of a
treaty. On its face, this provision does not apply. States cannot create context for the
purpose of an interpretation of a treaty through instruments that were not “made ... in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty.” There is a temporal requirement to this

provision of the VCLT that is not met by the EU Declaration on Achmea.

Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT instead permits a tribunal to take into account “any
subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the
application of its provisions.” Although the Declaration meets the temporal requirements
in Article 31(3), as those relate to subsequent agreements, it does not meet the requirement
that it be an “agreement between the parties.” First, the Declaration is not an agreement; it
provides a shared interpretation of the application of certain of the ECT’s provisions by a
subset of the parties to the ECT. Second, unlike other provisions in the VCLT, this article
does not refer to agreements between some of the parties to the agreement. Article 31(3)
of the VCLT clearly refers to an agreement as to interpretation made by all of the parties
to the agreement in question. In this case, in order for such an agreement be taken into
account in the interpretation of the ECT, it must be an agreement between all of the

Contracting Parties.

The Tribunal notes that the interpretation advanced by the Respondent would require the
Tribunal to read an exception into the clear wording of Article 26 of the ECT, which
provides unconditional consent to international arbitration. Such a reading is more properly
described as a modification of the treaty. Interpreting the ECT in this way would run afoul
of the general rule of interpretation, which requires ordinary meaning to be given to the
terms of the treaty. As discussed above, the VCLT sets out a specific process for such
modification of a multilateral treaty by some of the parties to that treaty. If the EU Member
States all agree that disputes with investors from the EU under the ECT shall not be
resolved by international arbitration, it would be a relatively straightforward exercise for

them to notify all of the Contracting States as to their intention to modify the ECT in this

way and to effectively do so. Neither the EU nor its Member States have followed that
process, which should not be circumvented by way of an interpretive exercise such as the

one proposed by the Respondent.

The provisions of the VCLT apply to treaties generally and safeguard the role of treaties in
the formation of binding obligations at international law. Article 26 of the VCLT confirms
pacta sunt servanda, the fundamental principle of international law that “[e]very treaty in
force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.” Failure
to adhere to that principle undermines the legitimacy of international law and can create
unfairness. Such a potential unfairness emerges from the EU Declaration on Achmea,
which in the context of bilateral investment treaties between EU Member States says that
all such treaties “are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable. They do not produce
effects including as regards provisions that provide for extended protection of investments
made prior to termination for a further period of time (so-called sunset or grandfathering

clauses).”

The Respondent would have this Tribunal interpret a clear granting of rights to all Investors
to international arbitration as having been void ab initio, ignoring all of the established
international law provisions for modification of treaties, without any notice to the
Contracting States to the ECT and without any regard for the rights of the Investors whose
rights have crystallized and who have commenced arbitrations accepting the
“unconditional consent” offered by those States. The entitlement to dispute resolution
under the ECT belongs to the investors, not the Contracting States.*!® The Tribunal
considers the result advocated by the Respondent and the EC to be neither permitted under

customary international law nor consistent with the rule of law.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s request for an award declaring

immediate termination on the basis of the EU Declaration on Achmea.

With respect to the underlying Achmea decision upon which the Declaration is based, the

Tribunal does consider it appropriate to review that decision in detail in light of the

ECT: C-001, Art. 26(2).

Declaration’s intention to inform tribunals, such as this one, about the alleged “legal
consequences of the Achmea judgment.” The Respondent contends that the ECJ’s decision
that intra-EU arbitration agreements are incompatible with EU primary law and thus
inapplicable, applies equally to the ECT. The EC contends that the fact that the EU is also
a party to the ECT does not affect this conclusion because “the participation of the EU in
that Treaty has only created rights and obligations between the EU and third countries and

has not affected the relations between the EU Member States.” 4!”

The ECJ’s decision arises out of a request for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 of the
TFEU from the Federal Court of Justice in Germany, coincidentally one of the home States
in this arbitration. The ECJ was asked about the validity under EU law of an agreement to
submit a dispute between an investor and a State under a bilateral investment treaty to
which both State parties were also EU Member States. The ECJ noted that “the referring
court questions whether Article 267 TFEU precludes [such] an arbitration clause,”*!* but
it decided to refer the following questions for preliminary ruling:

(1) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a bilateral

investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union

(a so-called intra-EU BIT) under which an investor of a Contracting State, in the

event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may

bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal where the

investment protection agreement was concluded before one of the Contracting

States acceded to the European Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be

brought until after that date?

If Question | is to be answered in the negative:

(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision?

If Questions | and 2 are to be answered in the negative:

(3) Does the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU preclude the application of such
a provision under the circumstances described in Question 1?

The ECJ reframed the questions posed by the referring court and considered questions
1 and 2 together as follows “whether Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as

precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States,

such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States
may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction
that Member State has undertaken to accept.” The ECJ noted that “an international

agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the Treaties or, consequently,

the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the Court.”*!?

The ECJ made it clear that it was reviewing provisions “such as Article 8 of the BIT,”

which provides as follows:

1. All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if, possible, be
settled amicably.

2. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in
paragraph | of this Article to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled
amicably within a period of six months from the date on which either party to the
dispute requested amicable settlement.

3. The arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article will be constituted
for each individual case in the following way: each party to the dispute appoints
one member of the tribunal and the two members thus appointed shall select a
national of a third State as Chairman of the tribunal. Each party to the dispute
shall appoint its member of the tribunal within two months, and the Chairman
shall be appointed within three months from the date on which the investor has
notified the other Contracting Party of his decision to submit the dispute to the
arbitral tribunal.

4. If the appointments have not been made in the abovementioned periods, either
party to the dispute may invite the President of the Arbitration Institute of the
Chamber of Commerce of Stockholm to make the necessary appointments. If the
President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented
from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make
the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either
Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the
most senior member of the Arbitration Institute who is not a national of either
Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.

5. The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules.

6. The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account
in particular though not exclusively:

- the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

- the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements
between the Contracting Parties;

- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;
- the general principles of international law. [Emphasis added]

Thus, the ECJ’s decision relates to the applicability of intra-EU arbitration agreements
where the tribunal under such an agreement is empowered to decide the dispute in part on
the basis of “the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned,” in other words, EU law.
The referring court noted that “[t]he arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings is
called on precisely to rule on an infringement of the provisions of the BIT, which it must
interpret in the light of EU law, in particular the provisions governing the free movement

of capital.”

The Court begins its analysis with this in mind: “It must be ascertained, first, whether the
disputes which the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT is called on to resolve
are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.”*”° The Court noted that
although the tribunal is called on to rule only on possible infringements of the BIT, pursuant
to the particular terms of Article 8 of the BIT, it must take into account EU law in so
doing.*?! Having determined that the particular disputes could require the tribunal to
interpret or apply EU law, the ECJ went on to consider whether such a tribunal was situated
within the judicial system of the EU and within the meaning of Article 267 of the TFEU.
The Court found that, in the circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT “established a mechanism
for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those
disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law,

even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law.”*??

In addition, the Court noted that an international agreement providing for a court
responsible for the interpretation of its provisions is not in principle incompatible with EU

law. The EU could submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by

international agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions
provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected.*”> The Court goes
on to note that the BIT was not concluded by the EU but by Member States and that these

two factors had an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law.

In summary, in Achmea the Court was concerned that EU Member States, but not the EU,
had entered into an agreement (through Article 8 of the BIT) to refer disputes to an
international tribunal that they empowered to apply national (EU) law and that that tribunal
did not have recourse to the ECJ to request interpretation of that law. In other words, the
Court’s concern was that Article 8 of the BIT at issue in Achmea raised the possibility that
disputes involving not only the interpretation of the BIT, but also the law in force in the
host state (national or EU law), could be referred to an arbitral tribunal was that agreed by
two EU Member States and not by the EU. The Tribunal does not understand the Achmea
decision to invalidate all arbitration agreements contained in intra-EU investment
agreements. In particular, contrary to the language contained in the Declaration, the Court
did not say that “all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment
treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus
inapplicable” nor did it say that “[a]n arbitral tribunal established on the basis of investor-
State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate by the

Member State party to the underlying bilateral investment Treaty.”*?+

The Tribunal does not see the ECJ judgment as applicable to the circumstances of this case
for two reasons. In this case, the Court’s concern is met by the fact that the EU itself is a
party to the ECT and by the fact that the ECT’s applicable law provision does not refer to

the law in force in the host State.

The EU itself is a party to the ECT along with the EU Member States. The EU is bound by

Article 26 of the ECT, including its dispute settlement provisions and applicable law

Achmea: CL-194, 457.
Respondent’s Request for Immediate Termination, 4 February 2019.

provision. The Court noted that the EU was empowered to enter into such agreements and

that they were not in principle incompatible with EU law.*75

338. In addition, Article 26(6) of the ECT provides that “[a] tribunal ... shall decide the issues
in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international
law.” Unlike the Achmea tribunal, the Tribunal is not empowered to decide based on “the
law in force of the Contracting Party concerned” or “other relevant agreements between
the Contracting Parties.” The Claimants claim for breaches of the ECT, which must be
decided only with reference to the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international
law. The Claimants submit that the phrase “applicable rules and principles of international
law” in ECT Article 26(6) refers to “public international law, not the regional law of the
EU (as interpreted by the ECJ).”4”° The Claimants note that Italian law is only relevant in
this case as a matter of fact and rely on the VCLT for their position that “[a] party may not
invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.”4?”

This Tribunal is not being called upon to decide issues of EU law under Article 26(6) of

the ECT.

339. For these reasons, the Tribunal does not consider that the Court’s reasoning in Achmea

applies to arbitrations under the ECT.

425 See Achmea: CL-194, § 57:
It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international
providing for the i of a court ible for the
interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions,
including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The
competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its capacity to
conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the
decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards
the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy
of the EU and its legal order is respected.

(3) Are all or some of the claims barred by the “Taxation Measures” carve-out
under Article 21 of the ECT? (Issue 1.3)

a

The Respondent’s Arguments

340. The Respondent objects to four of the Claimants’ claims as excluded from the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction on the basis that Article 21 of the ECT does not create rights or impose

obligations with respect to “Taxation Measures’

9.428

The Claimants’ allegation that Italy unfairly applied a domestic court decision
that ruled the so-called Robin Hood tax unconstitutional, because the decision
only applied ex nunc (for the future) rather than ex twnc (from inception). Italy
contends that the claim is excluded, because the Robin Hood tax is a “Taxation

Measure.”

The Claimants’ allegation that Italy failed to fairly correct its own arbitrary
classification of PV facilities as immovable property. Italy claims that since the
classification of PV facilities as immovable property subjects them to so-called

IMU and TASI taxes, this claim is excluded.

The Claimants’ allegation that Italy’s retroactive imposition of administrative
fees on their facilities was unfair. Italy claims that the disputed administration

fee is a “tax” falling into the “Taxation Measure” exclusion.

The Claimants’ allegation that imposing so-called “imbalance costs” on their
facilities was similarly unfair. Italy claims that the disputed imbalance costs are

“taxes” falling into the “Taxation Measure” exclusion.

341. With respect to the Claimants’ first two claims, the Respondent asserts that the Robin Hood

Tax is a tax on income, as confirmed by the Italian Constitutional Court, and that a measure

defining an asset as movable or immovable for cadastral and fiscal reasons is “indeed a

Page 133

fiscal measure itself, since its sole function is that of defining the scope of the taxation

measure.”*°

With respect to the Claimants’ third and fourth claims, the Respondent argues that the
“Claimants cannot seek redress for reliefs based on the imposition of administrative fees
by the [GSE] and the charging of ‘imbalance costs’ for the storage of electricity ... since
these are also Taxation Measures under the ECT,” and “it is up to domestic law to define
when a domestic measure is of a fiscal nature.”#*° The Respondent submits that the Italian

fiscal system is composed of taxes (imposte), fees (tasse) and contributions (contributi).**!

b. The Claimants’ Arguments

With respect to the first two claims, the Claimants assert that these claims do not arise from
the imposition of either the Robin Hood tax or the IMU and TASI charges themselves.**
Rather, the Claimants contest the unfair application of a domestic court decision and unfair
classification of PV facilities.*> The Claimants reject the Respondent’s assertion that they
did not simply decide to qualify their assets as immovable and thus pay IMU and TASI
charges. Instead, the Claimants assert that they paid those charges in good faith on the basis
of the Respondent’s inconsistent classification of PV plants, and thus are entitled to
reimbursement.*** The Claimants contend that the Respondent was wrong to have applied
that tax to its facilities from the beginning, and Italy’s constitutional court has agreed. The
Claimants assert that they are only contesting whether the application of Italy’s court
decision on a going-forward basis (ex nunc) rather than an application that would deem the

measure invalid from inception (ex twnc) was fair and in accordance with the ECT.**>

Similarly, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s classification of PV facilities as

immovable property was arbitrary, and that Italy conceded this when it corrected the

negative effects of that classification in its 2016 Budget Law. However, the Respondent’s
failure to refund past payment is the crux of this claim. The Claimants make clear that they
are claiming only the money that was paid under the wrongful classification, and not all

IMU and TASI charges that were ever assessed to Claimants’ plants.**°

With respect to the third and fourth claims, the Claimants assert that the Respondent’s
suggestion that either the administrative fees or the imbalance costs are “taxes” under
Italian law or “Taxation Measures” under the ECT is incorrect. The Claimants submit that
Italy has never treated those measures as “taxes” domestically, and only now refers to them
as such “to conjure a baseless jurisdictional objection.”**” The Claimants contest the
Respondent’s characterization of its fiscal system, and argue that its argument that Article
21 covers all three sub-categories of fiscal measures — taxes, fees and contributions — is an
“inaccurate characterization of ‘taxes’ in ECT Article 21(7)(a) as ‘fiscal measures’ or
‘tributi’.’” The Claimants aver that the Respondent attempts to “greatly expand the
purported scope of Article 21” as including any type of fiscal measure, when Article
21(7)(a) confines “fiscal measures” to the much narrower term of “taxes” (imposte).*®

According to the Claimants, the Italian version of the ECT makes this clear.**?

Citing the legal tests articulated in Murphy v. Ecuador, Occidental v. Ecuador and Yukos
v. Russia, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal must “look behind the label” and examine
the legal properties of each measure to determine whether it is a “tax” that falls within the
scope of Article 21 of the ECT.” For instance, taxation measures typically relate to the
imposition of a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the state for public purposes
and without any benefit to the taxpayer.*#! The Tribunal must consider the plain text of the

provision imposing the contested measure and the constitutional framework in which it

was enacted.*? The Claimants emphasize that only bona fide taxation measures can be
included within Article 21 of the ECT, meaning “actions that are motivated by the purpose

of raising general revenue for the state.”

347. Within this context, the Claimants advance three reasons why the administrative fees
imposed through Conto V and the imbalance costs introduced by the 2012 AEEG
Resolution No. 281/2012 do not constitute taxation measures under Article 21 of the
ECT.“ First, the measures do not increase state revenues, but rather are meant to cover a
specific service provided by a public authority, namely the costs of the GSE’s management,

monitoring and verification tasks.*45

348. Second, Italy’s tax authorities were not involved in enacting, imposing or collecting either
charge, and the Respondent never characterized either measure as a “tax” prior to this

arbitration.“°

349. Third, Conto V explicitly refers to the administrative fees as a “contribution” (contributo)
to the GSE.*#’ The Claimants argue that both the administrative and imbalance charges are
expressly linked to specific services performed by the GSE and Italy’s TSO for the general

benefit of energy consumers.*4*

Fourth, the imbalance costs represent an increase in the fees for network and dispatching
services, and cannot be considered a tax because in electricity bills, they do not fall within

this category but, rather, that of network and dispatching services.*”

Fifth, imbalance costs are subject to corporate income tax (22% VAT) as any ordinary
commercial income would be, which Claimants say “is a clear and unequivocal signal of

the non-fiscal nature of the underlying payment.”

Sixth, the Claimants point out that the administrative fees and imbalance costs are not
“taxes” because they are not included in the type of fiscal measures that are subject to the

tax jurisdiction of Italy’s tax courts.**!

Finally, the Claimants submit that the challenged charges are not subject to double-taxation

treaties under Italian law, which apply to both direct and indirect taxes.*°*

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection relates to specific claims made for relief
related to the Robin Hood Tax; the (re)classification of the tax status of PV plants; and the
administrative fees and imbalance costs, which it says all fall within the ECT’s tax carve-
out under Article 21. Article 21 of the ECT specifically provides that “nothing in this
Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the
Contracting Parties.” “Taxation Measures” are defined to include “any provision relating
to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof

or a local authority therein.”

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5

Page 137

With respect to the Robin Hood Tax, the Tribunal is of the view that these measures fall
within the broad definition of Taxation Measures contained in Article 21 of the ECT. The
Tribunal has noted that the Claimants’ claim is framed so as not to challenge the Robin
Hood Tax itself, but instead to address the means by which the Italian courts implemented
their decision as to the application of the tax. In the Tribunal’s view, framing the claim in
this way does not change the nature of the underlying measures of which the Claimants’
complain; they are tax measures and the underlying issue relates to whether the taxes were
fair (and not the Italian court’s application of the decision with respect to whether those
taxes was fair). Accordingly, the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection with respect to

Claimants’ claims arising out of the Robin Hood Tax is upheld.

Regarding the (re)classification claim, the Tribunal notes that the dispute relates to the
application of tax circulars and the Claimants’ reliance on one circular, without seeking a
definitive tax ruling, in circumstances where a number of circulars had existed and the
status of PV plants was, arguably, not clear. These measures are clearly “Taxation
Measures” in the sense contemplated in the ECT and thus, the claims related to the
(re)classification of property are outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction pursuant to the carve

out in Article 21 of the ECT.

Finally, with respect to the administrative fees and imbalance costs, the Tribunal agrees
with the Claimants that these charges were not taxes in the sense provided in Article 21 of
the ECT: they were not imposed for the purpose of raising general revenue for the state;
Italy’s tax authorities were not involved in enacting, imposing or collecting either charge;
are subject to corporate income tax; and they are not subject to double-taxation treaties
under Italian law, which apply to both direct and indirect taxes. Accordingly, they do not
fall within the definition of “Taxation Measure” in Article 21 of the ECT. The
Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction relating to the administrative fees and imbalance
costs are dismissed. The Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to decide the Claimants’

claims with respect to these charges.

(4) Did the Parties agree on a dispute resolution mechanism other than ICSID
arbitration? (Issue 1.4)
This objection to jurisdiction is based on the jurisdiction clause contained in the GSE

Agreements entered into between the Claimants’ Investments and the GSE.*>

a. The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent argues that the dispute resolution provision in the GSE Agreements
governing each of the Claimants’ PV plants deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction.**4 The
Respondent contends that the Claimants should “have indeed addressed the administrative
Court of Rome to have the GSE [Agreements] and the relevant regulatory acts annulled.”4>
The Respondent relies on the discussion of exclusive jurisdiction clauses in SGS v.

Philippines and BIVAC v. Paraguay.**°

In response to the Claimants’ assertion that they are not a party to the GSE Agreements,
the Respondent states that “then it must be deduced that no other obligation in the
agreement [GSE Agreement] could equally generate an autonomous obligation by Italy
towards the Claimants.”*>’ The Respondent contends that “either a treaty provision has
been breached by way of contract, but then only the counter-party shall have a right to
address an arbitral tribunal under the ECT ... and any third party allowed to claim under
the treaty will not be bound by any terms of the contract ... but will also be unable to rely

on any presumed autonomous contractual obligation it is not part [sic] to.”4*

The clause in question is the same in all of the GSE Agreements and figures as Clause 9, 13 or 15 of the

applicable agreement. It provides:

456

457

458

For any dispute arising out of or in any way connected to the interpretation and
execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to therein, the Parties
agree on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Rome.

b. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants assert that the Tribunal should reject the Respondent’s jurisdictional
argument that the dispute resolution clause in the GSE Agreements deprives it of
jurisdiction because the Claimants are not a party to those contracts (and thus have no
standing to pursue their claims before the Courts of Rome) and because the Claimants are

bringing claims under the ECT, not the GSE Agreements.*°°

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s Rejoinder does not directly address the
arguments raised by the Claimants that they are not parties to the GSE Agreements (and
thus are not bound by the forum selection clause therein) and that their claims are brought
under the ECT, not the GSE Agreements.*” Instead, the Respondent “attempts to confuse
the jurisdictional issue with liability under the ECT, re-hashing its argument on the merits

461 The Claimants argue that the

that the GSE [Agreements] are ‘accessory’ agreements.
fact that the Respondent’s breaches of the GSE Agreements could have simultaneously
breached the ECT does not reduce the Claimants’ ECT claims to mere contract claims.4
The Respondent’s arguments thus fail to address its liability under the ECT’s umbrella

the present facts because the claimants in those cases were parties to the contracts at issue
in those disputes. Rather than having to decide whether the contractual breach rises to

the level of a treaty breach, the issue here is whether the Respondent violated the ECT.*%

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection relates to what it says is a choice of venue
— the provisions in the GSE Agreements (between Claimants’ local entities and the State)
provide for disputes to be submitted to the Courts of Rome. Alternatively, Italy argues that
the Claimants do not have the standing to pursue the claims related to the GSE Agreements

in this arbitration.

Italy argues that the dispute resolution provision in the GSE Agreements deprives the
Tribunal of jurisdiction to decide whether Italy breached those Agreements. Italy contends
that the Claimants have to proceed (and should have proceeded) against Italy exclusively
before the Italian courts to have the GSE Agreements, the Spalmaincentivi, and other
“relevant regulatory acts annulled.”** Italy further asserts that the ECT’s umbrella clause
is inapplicable because, as opposed to private law contracts, the GSE Agreements are
accessory agreements and have a special status under Italian law which requires that the
Tribunal evaluate any alleged breach within “[a] very specific context,” or else “stay the

proceedings waiting for the Court of Rome to judge on the matter.”4?

In the Tribunal’s view, the GSE Agreements’ exclusive jurisdiction clause does not affect

the Claimants’ ability to bring the claims they pursue under the ECT.

private law contracts, and acknowledge that they are governed by Italian law. However, contrary to Italy’s argument
that the GSE Agreements were mere accessory contracts with no legal effect, the Claimants assert that the Agreements
were not typical operations of administrative law, but rather contain features common in private law contracts. In
particular, the Claimants point out that references in those Agreements to Articles 1341 and 1342 of Italy’s Civil Code
evince that they are in private contracts, in which one party had more bargaining power as author of the contract.

The GSE Agreements provide that disputes arising out of or in any way connected to the
interpretation of the Agreement entered into between the GSE and the Claimants’
individual Investments fall within the “exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Rome.”*” The
Claimants are not parties to any of the GSE Agreements and they bring their claims

pursuant to various clauses of the Article 10(1) of the ECT.

Italy relies on SGS v. Philippines and BIVAC v. Paraguay for its assertion that exclusive
jurisdiction clauses in a contract prevail over dispute settlement clauses in investment
treaties.4”! The SGS v. Philippines tribunal held that even though it had jurisdiction to hear
the contract claims, this did not mean that the parties’ express choice of forum in the
contract was negated. Rather, the tribunal stated that “a binding exclusive jurisdiction
clause in a contract should be respected, unless overridden by another valid provision.”
Thus, that tribunal held that, although it had jurisdiction to hear the contract breaches due
to the umbrella clause violation, the claim was inadmissible as the general provisions of

the BIT did not override the forum selection clause in the contract.

However, as the Claimants point out, the Claimants are not themselves a party to the GSE
Agreements and thus have no standing to pursue their claims before Italy’s domestic courts.
Thus, the paramountcy of the exclusive jurisdiction clause over the dispute resolution
clause discussion in SGS v. Philippines and BIVAC v. Paraguay on which Italy relies is
distinguishable from the present facts. The claimants in those cases were parties to the
contracts at issue in those disputes, whereas here they are not.*”* The Claimants argue that:

In both SGS and BIVAC, the tribunals thus had to determine whether a breach of

the contract rose to the level of a breach of the investment treaty at issue. The

issue here, by contrast, is whether Italy’s retroactive modifications of its incentive

regimes applicable to the PV sector violated the substantive protections of the
ECT. As noted by the ad hoc panel in Vivendi v. Argentina, “[a] state cannot rely

on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid the characterisation of its
conduct as internationally unlawful under a treaty.”473

The Tribunal agrees with this proposition. The mere existence of an exclusive jurisdiction

clause in the agreements is not determinative of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The Claimants’ position is that they are bringing their claims under the ECT, not under the
GSE Agreements.*” As such, rather than having to decide whether the alleged contractual
breach of the GSE Agreements rises to the level of a treaty breach, the issue before the
Tribunal is whether Italy violated the ECT.*”* The thrust of the Claimants’ argument is that
the GSE Agreements entered into by Italy with the Claimants’ Investments provide
evidence of the broad obligations Italy entered into with those Investments and also
informed the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. In particular, the Claimants assert that
their claims are brought under the ECT’s substantive protective clauses — FET, non-
impairment clause, and the umbrella clause — and, in particular, the legitimate expectation
that Italy would abide by its obligations to the Italian companies who own the Claimants’

341 PV plants at issue (Claimants’ Investments).*”°

In response to the Claimants’ assertion that they are not a party to the GSE Agreements,
Italy argues that no other obligation in the GSE Agreements generates an autonomous
obligation by Italy towards the Claimants. Italy’s position is that SGS v. Philippines and
BIVAC v. Paraguay confirm that, where the ECT is breached by way of contract, “only the
counter-party shall have a right to address an arbitral tribunal under the ECT ... and any
third party allowed to claim under the treaty will not be bound by any terms of the contract
... but will also be unable to rely on any presumed autonomous contractual obligation it is
not part [sic] to.”47’ The Claimants contend that Italy’s line of reasoning does not directly

address the fact that the Claimants are not parties to the GSE Agreements, and thus are not

bound by the forum selection clause. Further, their claims are not contractual claims. They

are brought under the ECT, not the GSE Agreements.*”*

373. One commentator identifies the difficulties involved in how to address a breach of contract
claim as a treaty claim when the contract itself has a choice of forum clause in it, citing the

following passage from the Vivendi I v. Argentina annulment decision of 3 July 2002:4”

where ‘the fundamental basis of the claim’ is a treaty laying down an independent
standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an
exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent
state cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard. At most, it
might be relevant —as municipal law will often be relevant— in assessing whether
there has been a breach of treaty.

 

374. The Vivendi I v. Argentina annulment committee further observed that the choice of forum
clause in a contract “did not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal with respect to a claim
based on the provisions of the BIT. Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract did not in
terms purport to exclude the jurisdiction of an international tribunal arising under ... the

BIT; at the very least, a clear indication of an intention to exclude that jurisdiction would

be required.”4°°

375. The tribunal in Joy Mining v. Egypt also noted the distinction between a contractual and
treaty claim, and cautioned that “[a] purely contractual claim, however, will normally find
difficulty in passing the jurisdictional test of treaty-based tribunals, which will of course

require allegation of a specific violation of treaty rights as the foundation of their

jurisdiction.”**!

48 CPHB, 4 64; Claimants’ Reply, {| 461. See also Claimants’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, | 104: The Claimants

contend that Italy’s pleadings ignore its liability under the ECT’s broad umbrella clause. The Italian companies which
are party to each of the GSE Agreements are “clearly ‘Investments’ of Claimants in Italy” and, as such, “Italy’s
obligations to Claimants do not arise only under the GSE Agreements, but under the ECT’s substantive protection
clauses, including most notably the umbrella clause.”

The reasoning in these two cases highlights the distinction between a claim of treaty
violation and a claim of breach of contract. The Claimants have brought the former. In so
far as the Claimants’ umbrella clause claims are concerned, the Claimants are not parties
to the GSE Agreements and their claims are not for breaches of the GSE Agreements per
se; they are for breach of the provisions of the ECT that protect an Investor and its
Investment from arbitrary acts by the state, by way of the broad language of the umbrella

clause in the ECT.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the exclusive forum clauses in the GSE
Agreements do not affect its jurisdiction to determine Claimants’ claims for breach of the

ECT.

(5) Did the Claimants satisfy the notice requirements under Article 26 of the
ECT? (Issue 1.5)

As an additional jurisdictional objection, the Respondent argues that the Claimants did not
properly notify their claims related to the Robin Hood Tax and the (re)classification
measures. The Tribunal has found that it does not have jurisdiction over either of these
claims, as they fall within the tax carve out in Article 21 of the ECT. However, for the sake

of completeness, the Parties’ arguments are set out here and will be briefly addressed.

a. The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent argues that the Claimants have not satisfied the ECT’s notice requirements
with respect to the following two claims, because these were not notified to the Respondent

in the Amicable Settlement Letters:**”

e The Respondent’s allegedly unfair implementation of the Italian court decision

finding the Robin Hood tax unconstitutional; and

e The Respondent’s alleged acknowledgment in the 2016 Budget Law of the

negative effects of its reclassification of the Claimants’ PV plants as immovable

property, but its failure to reimburse the Claimants for payments already made

under the “misclassification.”

According to the Respondent, the Claimants “spend no words” in their Reply addressing
the allegation that the two claims are entirely new.**? Further, the Respondent asserts that
just because it did not respond to any of the Amicable Settlement Letters does not mean
that it would not respond to a future letter.*** The Respondent argues that “[i]f extremely
heterogeneous claims are joined under a sole artificial label because all, more or less
remotely, affect a specific investment, the State will never be able to consciously evaluate
how to address each measure ... [thus] the foreign investor, that might miss the chance of

an amicable solution” by not notifying it of all claims.**°

b. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants submit that over three and a half years have passed since the Amicable
Settlement Letters and over two years since the Request for Arbitration, and the
Respondent has never attempted to negotiate a settlement to any part of the dispute.**° The
Claimants argue that it would not make sense to decline jurisdiction on the basis of this

objection because the waiting period for amicable settlement has passed.**’

The Claimants state that the two measures that the Respondent contends are outside the

scope of the Amicable Settlement Letters occurred either just before or well after Claimants

sent their final notice letter to the Respondent and that they relate to the same subject

matter of this dispute.**? The Claimants submit that the Respondent unfairly implemented
the court decision finding the Robin Hood tax unconstitutional in February 2015, which
was immediately before the Claimants sent their first Amicable Settlement Letter in March
2015. Thus they “did not have sufficient information to include a productive discussion”
about this measure in their letter.4°° The Respondent’s decision to retain IMU and TASI
payments was made in January 2016, which was well afier Claimants sent their second

Amicable Settlement Letter.

383. The Claimants state that the Letters were worded “broadly and discussed the nature of the

dispute in detail” and were explicitly stated to be “illustrative rather than exhaustive.”4?!
The Claimants argue that it would be “procedurally inefficient and hinder claimants from
bringing otherwise meritorious claims” to require that the Respondent be notified anew,
and re-extend the amicable solution offer, every time the Respondent adopted a new
measure that harmed Claimants’ investments, particularly given that the Respondent did
not respond to the Amicable Settlement Letters.”

further requests for negotiations identifying Spain’s subsequent measures would

The Claimants also rely on the finding in Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine that the notice
requirement is not overly formalistic and that precise congruity in the investor’s
articulation of its grievances in mediation and arbitration is not required.*** Notice need
neither be “complete or exhaustive,” nor detailed.*?> Moreover, ICSID Arbitration Rule
40 provides that the parties may adjust their claims/counter-claims not later than in the

reply or counter-memorial.*”°

The Claimants submit that the Respondent ignores the case law cited in support of the
Claimants’ arguments.*” Contrary to the Respondent’s assertion that the two claims are
new, the Claimants state that the developments in Italy’s court and bureaucracy related to
the two measures form part of “an evolving series of measures changing the economic

regime” for solar power plants in Italy.4%*

The Claimants assert that the Respondent’s assertion that allowing the two claims prevents
it from consciously evaluating how to address each measure is “nonsensical,” given that it
already responded fully to these claims, and disregards the reality that parties will develop

their claims over the course of a proceeding.*””

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis

As noted above, this particular jurisdictional objection has become moot, as the Tribunal
has upheld the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction with respect to these specific claims.

it briefly. In the Tribunal’s view, the lack of a specific subsequent notice regarding the

Claimants’ claims relating to the Robin Hood Tax and the (re)classification measures, on

its own, would not have deprived the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear these claims.

The Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants’ notice letters in this case were worded

broadly enough to provide the Respondent with sufficient notice of the claims.

Had the Contracting Parties intended to include a strict notice and amicable settlement
provision in the ECT, it would have included a provision which prohibits the amendment
of claims.°° As pointed out by the Claimants, ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 allows the
submission of ancillary claims at later points in the proceedings. Article 47 of the ICSID
Additional Facility and Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules similarly provide

for additional claims.

It would be contrary to the need for orderly and cost-effective procedure to halt this
arbitration at this advanced juncture and require the Claimants first to consult with the
Respondent with regard to the two claims, before re-submitting all of the claims to this

Tribunal.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that there is no evidence advanced by the Respondent in these
proceedings to indicate its willingness or desire to enter into settlement negotiations in
respect of the dispute. The Respondent’s arguments in this respect are formalistic and there
is no indication that it was unable to effectively discuss these claims (had it engaged in
settlement discussions) or suffered prejudice in any way as a result of a lack of specific

notification.
ADMISSIBILITY (ISSUE 2)

THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

In the event that the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections, the

Respondent submits that “these should be at least grounds to declare lack of admissibility,”

See, e.g., Article 8.22(1) of the CETA, which provides that “[aJn investor may only submit a claim pursuant

to Article 8.23 if the investor: ... (d) has fulfilled the requirements related to the request for consultations; (e) does not
identify a measure in its claim that was not identified in its request for consultations.”

on account of the exclusive forum clause in the GSE Agreements.*°! The Respondent cites
SGS v. Philippines, which it says concluded that the exclusive forum clause was a matter
of admissibility, rather than jurisdiction, because parties should not be permitted to rely on
a contract as the basis of their BIT claim when that contract refers disputes exclusively to
another forum.*°* The Respondent avers that, “[a]ssuming the widest definition of
arbitrability is taken, this would then mean that the Tribunal had to judge ... a breach of a
contract,” which “could only be judged under Italian law.”°°? The Respondent asserts that
due to the inapplicability of the ECT’s umbrella clause, “the Tribunal will not be in a
position to judge whether GSE ever breached the [Agreements]” because they “have a
special status under Italian law and this would require the Tribunal to evaluate any potential
breach within such [a] very specific context” or else “stay the proceedings waiting for the

Court of Rome to judge on the matter.”>"

393. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ Reply ignores its arguments on

admissibility.*”

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ ARGUMENTS

394. The Claimants state that the Respondent incorrectly asserts that the Claimants have not
responded to the Respondent’s arguments on admissibility.°°° In their Counter-Memorial
on Jurisdiction, Reply, and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimants submit that their
responses to Italy’s objections are substantially the same regardless of whether Italy
chooses to characterize its arguments as jurisdictional arguments or arguments against

and as such are not entitled to bring claims in their own right under those agreements.*°*
Rather, their claim is brought under the ECT’s substantive protective clauses, including the
umbrella clause and the legitimate expectation that the Respondent would abide by its
obligations to the Claimants’ Investments, the Italian solar special purpose vehicles who

own the relevant PV plants.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal’s findings on the jurisdictional objections related to these claims is equally
applicable to Italy’s objections based on admissibility. The objection as to the admissibility

of these claims is dismissed.
APPLICABLE LAW (ISSUE 3)

THE CLAIMANTS’ ARGUMENTS

The Claimants state that the ICSID Convention requires that the Tribunal decide the merits
of this dispute “in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.”°°°
By agreeing to resolve this dispute under the ECT, the Parties have agreed to apply the
ECT’s governing law provision, which provides that the Tribunal “shall decide the issues
in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international
law.”5!° Article 26(6) of the ECT indicates that the ECT and international law are the

applicable law of this dispute; not EU law or Italian law.

The Claimants point out that several arbitral awards have confirmed that only international
law and the terms of the ECT govern an arbitration, and under the Treaty that the applicable

international law includes the 1969 VCLT*!! and the 2002 United Nations International

(“ILC Articles on State Responsibility”).*!

THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

A number of the Respondent’s submissions rely on Italian law. In its arguments on
jurisdiction, Italy also argued that EU law is part of the applicable international law to this
dispute (which it says deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction, if the Tribunal upholds the
Respondent’s intra-EU and primacy of EU law objections). The Respondent suggests that
Italian law should influence the legal standards that the Tribunal applies to determine

whether Italy violated the ECT and international law.°'3

The Respondent contends that the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision is relevant to this
arbitration as applicable law and as fact because it makes reference to EU and ECHR case
law, and because the standards applying to legitimate expectations (and FET more
generally) “must be assessed also considering that domestic and international case law as

relevant applicable law.”>!*

The Respondent relies on its Constitutional Court’s reasoning and conclusions on the
subject of investors’ legitimate expectations, particularly regarding the right of the state to
modify long-term relationships in legislation affecting vested rights.*'> In arguing that its
legislative and regulatory modifications were reasonable, the Respondent refers to what it

of international law under Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ [International Court of

Justice].”>!”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants*'* that Italian law is relevant to this dispute only
as a matter of fact or background context, and that it should not influence the legal
standards that the Tribunal applies to determine whether the Respondent violated the ECT.
Whether or not the Challenged Measures complied with domestic law is irrelevant for the
Tribunal’s purposes. The Tribunal observes that EU law is not invoked or implicated in
this ECT arbitration, and thus does not form part of the governing international law

applicable to the issues before the Tribunal.

The ECT specifically refers only to the Treaty and principles of international law as the
law governing the dispute. Therefore, the Tribunal is not permitted to apply Italian law in
the sense of a governing law in this arbitration and the liability questions in this case need
only be determined through an application of the ECT itself, as well as related principles
of international law. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s arguments regarding

the deferential approach it should take to Italy’s Constitutional Court decisions.

It is trite law that a party may not invoke provisions of its internal law as justification for

its failure to perform a treaty.>!°

This is not to say that Italian law has no role in this arbitration. It is relevant as a factual
element of the disputes the Tribunal must resolve. Accordingly, the Tribunal has
considered and analysed the various relevant Italian laws and decrees at issue as part of the
factual context. In this regard, for example, the Tribunal will address the Respondent’s
submissions regarding the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision under the legitimate

expectations analysis below.

THE RESPONDENT’S GENERAL DEFENSES ON THE MERITS

Before turning to the Claimants’ claims under the ECT, the Tribunal finds it helpful to
address a general issue which underlies the Respondent’s defenses to the claims based on
the Spalmaincentivi Decree and other Challenged Measures: namely, the state’s right to
regulate and the need to reduce incentive tariffs in order to reduce costs to end-users and
to preserve the incentive system itself. The Respondent relies on this broad defense at
multiple junctures throughout its pleadings in response to all of the Claimants’ claims, and

the Tribunal will address these specific arguments under Issues 4.1 to 4.3 below.

THE RIGHT TO REGULATE
qd) The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants’ claims are based on the assurances and commitments, which they say were
made by Italy in the Conto Energia and the Off-Take regimes, on which they relied in
making their investments. The Claimants say that these regimes were set out in specific
detail in legislation and regulations adopted by Italy, as well as the Agreements concluded
with the GSE, a public entity wholly-owned and controlled by Italian ministries. According
to the Claimants, Italy exercised its regulatory power to encourage investment in the PV
sector by adopting the Conto Energia and Off-Take regimes and the assurances and
commitments they provided. In doing so, the Respondent deliberately chose to relinquish
or limit its discretion to amend those regimes by reducing the Conto Energia tariffs and
the Minimum Guaranteed Prices.*”° The Claimants say that the Respondent accomplished
its goals thanks to the incentives contained in the Conto Energia and Off-Take regimes,
and cannot subsequently change them for existing plants which qualified for, and were

granted, the incentives.

Quoting from ADC v. Hungary, the Claimants say that the Respondent accepted limits on
its sovereign right to regulate when it entered into the ECT and accepted the investment
protection obligations contained in it. According to the Claimants, it is a basic principle of

international law accepted by many Tribunals that a state’s right to regulate is limited when

the state creates legitimate expectations on the part of investors, especially when those
expectations are created by specific commitments or assurances designed to encourage
investors to invest.*?! In this case, the Claimants say that Italy gave very specific
commitments in the Conto Energia Decrees that particular PV facilities would be paid at a
specific tariff at a constant rate for a period of 20 years. They say that the Respondent made
that commitment in the Conto Energia Decrees and in official statements and promotional
efforts. In addition, the Respondent reconfirmed its commitment by way of the GSE Letters
and GSE Agreements.*”? The Claimants make similar arguments with respect to the

Off-Take Regime and the MGP.*>

The Claimants also say that even where a state has not made a “specific commitment”
regarding an investor’s investment, the right to regulate is not absolute. In this regard, the
Claimants submit that changes to a regulatory framework can be considered unfair if they
are contrary to commonly recognized financial and economic principles of “regulatory
fairness” or “regulatory certainty.”°*4 On this basis, the Claimants say that even if Italy had
not given specific commitments of stability with respect to their investments, it could not

enact measures that violated principles of regulatory fairness and certainty.*>

(2) The Respondent’s Arguments

For the Respondent, the key issue before this Tribunal is whether “the ECT prohibit[s] a
party to the Treaty from using its sovereign power to make limited adjustments to a
category of incentives in the absence of a stabilization clause, and when it does so in a

non discriminatory, proportionate and reasonable manner?”**°

CPHB, 4 48-49. See also Claimants’ Reply, §f] 244-245, 341-348 and the sources cited therein.

CPHB, §[ 53. In this regard, the Claimants say that where specific commitments have been made by a state,

as in this case, there is no room for a “balancing exercise” between the legitimate expectations of the investor and the
state’s authority and need to regulate and amend its legislation over time: see CPHB, 4 54-55.

The Respondent raises a state’s right to regulate as a defense in respect of the
Spalmaincentivi Decree, and other Challenged Measures more generally, and insists that
only a “fair return”/“remuneration” was guaranteed to the Claimants.*?” The Respondent
argues that “the protection of investor’s legitimate expectations cannot amount to a general
freezing clause of the State regulatory powers,” which “prevent[s] a State from progressing
its general legislation in a reasonable way.”** In the Respondent’s view, the FET standard
does not require that states freeze their legislation, nor does it only allow them to modify

their regulations when in a state of necessity.*”°

The Respondent says that the 2009 EC Directive — which states that “it is vital that [EU]
Member States can control the effect and costs of their [incentive tariff] schemes according
to their different potentials” — is important for understanding the regulatory context before
the Claimants made their investments. The Respondent argues that it is “inherent in the
way the mechanism works” that it must remunerate both investment and operating costs,
but that the latter “vary in the course of the years and cannot be exactly pre-determined.”**°
The Respondent further asserts that the incentive tariff is given on the top of the
remuneration for production, and is therefore an “addition” to revenues, varying according

to the electricity actually produced.**!

According to the Respondent, neither its acts nor its general regulatory framework,
including the Conto Energia Decrees, should be interpreted as a stabilization clause that
promised that it would not change the incentive tariffs for 20 years.*** The Respondent

argues that it never unequivocally waived its right to regulate in its general regulatory

As will be discussed under Issues 4.1-4.3 below, the Claimants counter that the Respondent’s specific

commitments in the Contos and other representations regarding the stability of tariffs granted to PV facilities limited
its right to change its incentive framework retroactively. The Claimants emphasize that regulatory certainty was one
of the benchmark features motivating the support schemes from the beginning, and in this context, the Respondent
cannot argue that the Spalmaincentivi is a valid exercise of regulatory powers. See Respondent’s Closing Presentation,

framework.*** The Respondent argues that “[a]t [the] primary level of the regulation, the
Italian Parliament did not expressly (or implicitly) authorize the Italian Government to
dispose of the fundamental State’s right to regulate.”*** The Respondent avers that the only
way to “freeze” its right to regulate would be if the legislation through which the Italian
Parliament instructed the government to implement the EC Directives and to develop a PV
regulatory framework (Laws No. 39/2002 or No. 96/2010) had authorized the adoption of
such a stabilization clause in the Conto Energia Decrees, GSE Agreements, and other
relevant legislation or regulation. The Respondent states that the “primary level of the
regulation” (either Legislative Decrees Nos. 387/2003 or 28/2011) would have had to

include an unequivocal stabilization clause.**>

The Respondent argues that “an absolute inhibition to further legislate is contrary to a
fundamental principle of international law,” as the power of a state to “progressively
modify its legislation is related to the essence of statehood, subject to the requirement that
such modification be made in a reasonable and proportional way and by respecting its own
law.” For the Respondent this “is an unavoidable starting point for assessing the existence
of a violation of the FET standard,” rather than “a mere defence.”**°

As will be discussed in detail under each of the Claimants’ claims that the Respondent
violated the ECT’s FET standard, the Respondent argues that Article 10(1) of the ECT
does not embody a freezing clause.**” The Respondent states that “the principle of stability
of a regulatory framework is not at all equivalent to an obligation for States not to modify
their legislation when investors are affected.”*** Rather, the Respondent asserts that

that the Spalmaincentivi Decree and the other Challenged Measures constitute reasonable

modifications.

The Respondent relies on Saluka v. Czech Republic, which held that “no investor may
reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made
remain totally unchanged.”**? The Respondent relies on the holding in that case that the
determination of whether the investor’s expectations were justified and reasonable must
also take into account “the host State’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic
matters in the public interest.”*#! The Respondent relies on Parkerings v. Lithuania, which
it says also confirms this point.*“? In submissions following the Hearing, based on more

recent cases involving PV investments in Italy, the Respondent also relied on the approach

543 54d +

of the tribunals in the Belenergia v. the Italy** and SunReserve v. the Italy“ in support of

its arguments regarding a state’s right to regulate.

In response to the Claimants’ claim that Italy’s imposition of the Administration Fees and
Imbalance Charges were an indirect way of reducing the incentive tariffs in the Conto
Energia Decrees, the Respondent points out that Contos I-IV do not expressly address the
potential for these additional charges. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should not
construe this silence as sufficient to give rise to legitimate expectations by the Claimants
that no such costs would be imposed on them.**> Invoking its right to regulate, the
Respondent suggests that such an interpretation would “transform the FET clause into a

general freezing clause of State regulatory activity.”*4°

the successive regulatory activity of a country, without any specific contractual

commitment towards a concrete investor.”*47 The Respondent argues that the Conto
Energia Decrees

did not include a clause having the specific aim to freeze the future legislation on

incentive tariffs for [20] years. Its guarantee was indeed subject to the reasonable

evolution of legislation according to the Italian and European legal orders, as the

Italian Constitutional Court has also recently recognised, so stating the full
legitimacy of the Spalma-incentivi Decree.*4*

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

In the Tribunal’s view, while a state possesses the inherent right to regulate its domestic
affairs, it can agree to limit the exercise of that right. Notably, by entering into an
international treaty, such as the ECT, the state parties agreed to certain obligations that
could have an effect on their inherent right to regulate their domestic affairs. One example
of a specific obligation in the ECT that may result in agreed limitations to the inherent right
to regulate domestic affairs are the binding investment protection obligations. Numerous
arbitral tribunals have found that where a state makes a specific promise or commitment or
undertakes a specific obligation to an investor, it limits the exercise of its right to regulate

domestic affairs;*“?

any such regulation must also be in accordance with the state’s
international obligations agreed in the ECT. The Tribunal notes that the ECT does not
directly limit a state’s inherent right to regulate its domestic affairs. Instead, the ECT
provides investors affected by domestic regulation that is not in accordance with
international obligations with an avenue of recourse for alleged breaches of the ECT in an

independent forum.
In El Paso Energy v. Argentina, the tribunal held as follows:

There can be no legitimate expectation for anyone that the legal framework will
remain unchanged in the face of an extremely severe economic crisis. No
reasonable investor can have such an expectation unless very specific

commitments have been made towards it or unless the alteration of the legal
framework is total.

A reasonable general regulation can be considered a violation of the FET standard
if it violates a specific commitment towards the investor. The Tribunal considers
that a special commitment by the State towards an investor provides the latter with
a certain protection against changes in the legislation, but it needs to discuss more
thoroughly the concept of “specific commitments.” In the Tribunal’s view, no
general definition of what constitutes a specific commitment can be given, as all
depends on the circumstances. However, it seems that two types of commitments
might be considered “specific”: those specific as to their addressee and those
specific regarding their object and purpose ...

[A] reiteration of the same type of commitment in different types of general
statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific behaviour
of the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the investor a guarantee on
which it can justifiably rely.5°°

420. In this case, the Claimants do not argue that the Respondent was required to freeze its
framework regulating the incentivization of the production of electricity by PV facilities.
Rather, their claim is that the Respondent made specific commitments that the tariffs
granted to qualifying PV facilities would be maintained at a constant rate for a fixed period.
In the Tribunal’s view, this situation must be distinguished from that addressed in other
awards in which no specific promise or commitment was alleged or found to have been
made.*>! In this case, while neither the legislative decrees nor the Conto Energia Decrees
contain an express statement by which the Respondent agreed to freeze the incentive
regime, the Claimants say that it contains a similar undertaking by guaranteeing specific

tariff rates which would remain constant for a term of 20 years.*°

The Tribunal notes that, to the extent that the reasoning of the SunReserve v. Italy tribunal
can be taken to have included a separate “balancing” exercise between the state’s right to
regulate as a general principle of international law and its FET obligations,>>? it disagrees
with that approach. The Respondent undertook specific obligations in the ECT and the
Tribunal’s task is to determine the extent of those obligations to the Claimants in this case,
which does involve an interpretation of the ECT provisions and a review of the factual
circumstances particular to the case. It does not involve a fresh consideration of the
Respondent’s right to regulate generally; it involves an interpretation of any limits to that

right agreed to by the Respondent through the ECT.

Accordingly, the issue the Tribunal must address is whether the Respondent made specific
assurances, commitments or otherwise entered into any obligations which limited its right
to regulate and modify the tariffs granted to qualifying PV plants in which the Claimants

invested.

NECESSITY

The Tribunal also finds it helpful to clarify an issue as to whether the Respondent has
invoked the defense of necessity.

() The Respondent’s Arguments

In its submissions, the Respondent refers to the need or necessity to reduce the incentive
tariffs in its FIT mechanism in order to reduce the burden on end-users and also to protect

and guarantee the preservation of the system itself.°>+

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent contests that it is advancing a necessity defense, stating

that the Claimants are “trying to impose on Italy a disproportionate burden,” presumably

against the risk of any changes in the host State’s legal and economic framework.
Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable” (emphasis added).

See also Claimants’ Reply, §9] 245, 343 and the cases cited at fn. 233, especially Total v. Argentina: CL-051,

{119 (“specific commitments limit the right of the host State to adapt the legal framework to changing
circumstances”).

by insisting that Italy must satisfy the four elements in order to make out its necessity

argument.*°>

In its Comments on New Legal Authorities, the Respondent takes issue with the Greentech
v. Italy award’s finding that, notwithstanding Italy’s difficult economic situation, “none of
the circumstances evidenced in this case reach the level of force majeure ... given that the
justification for changes relate simply to alleged compensation to the service provider and
the marginal cost to consumers.”>*° For the Respondent, the crux of its argument is about
“the balancing between the right to regulate of a state (that does not amount to proving
‘force majeure’!!) against the (extremely limited) restriction of Claimants’ rights.” The
Respondent attempts to distinguish the Greentech v. Italy award on the basis that “it takes
the liberty to consider that such [public] interest was ‘simply’ (!!) to protect the right of
consumers (and service provider, which in fact does not even correspond to Respondent’s

claim.”557

(2) The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants say that the Respondent has not established the basis for any “necessity”
defense. They argue that the Respondent has not established a factual basis for the need to
implement the Spa/maincentivi Decree, whether as regards the need to relieve the burden
of electricity prices on end-users or to preserve the FIT incentive system. They also argue
that even if the Respondent could point to a valid basis explaining why the Spalmaincentivi
Decree was necessary, it did not, and cannot, demonstrate the requirements of the defense

of necessity under international law.*°*

Respondent’s Rejoinder, { 178 (“The Respondent’s argument, that there is no violation of FET because no

legitimate expectation for a freezing clause exists in the FET standard, is then transformed by the Claimants in a sort
of state of necessity, thus trying to impose on Italy a disproportionate burden.”).

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal finds that while Italy refers to its dire financial situation and a need to reduce

the burden on end consumers’ electricity bills,*°°

its arguments focus on its need and
obligation to “adapt progressively domestic legislation and secondary regulations to an
evolving scenario,” which Italy says requires it to review and modify its incentive

framework to ensure its sustainability.*°

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not pleaded a defense of necessity under
international law and has confirmed that it is not advancing that defense. Consequently,

the Tribunal need not address any such defense.

Rather, the Tribunal understands that the Respondent has referred to what it considered to
be the need to reduce the cost of electricity to end-users, which it considers to be a
legitimate public policy goal of regulation. Further, the Respondent’s arguments speak to
its need to maintain the sustainability of the incentives regime as factors explaining why it
adopted the Challenged Measures and what it maintains was the reasonableness of those
measures. These arguments in defense of the claims will be addressed, as necessary, in the

analysis that follows.
MERITS: ARTICLE 10(1) OF THE ECT (ISSUE 4)

The Claimants claim that the Challenged Measures implemented by the Respondent violate
their rights protected by three aspects of Article 10(1) of the ECT: the requirement to
accord to investors fair and equitable treatment; the impairment clause, pursuant to which
the Respondent may not in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures
the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of Investments of Investors; and
the umbrella clause, pursuant to which the Respondent must observe any obligations it has

entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor. The Claimants submit that

each of the Challenged Measures violated the FET standard, the Impairment Clause and
the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT. Each will be considered in turn.

For the reasons that follow, the majority of the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent
breached all three aspects of Article 10(1) of the ECT (FET, the Impairment Clause and
the Umbrella Clause). Arbitrator L. Boisson de Chazournes disagrees and her dissenting

position on each of these issues is also set out below.

FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT (“FET”) (ISSUE 4.1(A))

Article 10(1) of the ECT requires Italy to accord FET to investors. It provides in relevant

part as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,
encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for
Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such
conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.>*'

For the Claimants, the issue before this Tribunal is whether

the ECT permit[s] Italy to induce substantial foreign investments ... by
guaranteeing support to eligible PV facilities for a fixed period of time under a
very clear and certain legal, regulatory and contractual framework ... and then
fundamentally repudiate or abrogate and alter that framework once investments
have been made in reliance upon it.5?

The Claimants allege that once Italy had reaped the benefits of the investments it had
attracted through its legislative, regulatory and contractual guarantees and commitments,
it reneged on its promises to the substantial detriment of the Claimants.*® In so doing, the

Claimants say the Respondent violated the FET provision in Article 10(1) of the ECT.

In addition to its right to regulate outlined above,°™ the Respondent’s response to this

allegation is detailed under the subsections that follow.

qd) Does the ECT’s FET Standard Contain One or More Autonomous Sub-
Standards?

a. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants allege that the Respondent breached the FET standard under Article 10(1)
of the ECT in three distinct ways:

e First, by violating the Claimants’ legitimate expectations of predictable and

stable support for their PV facilities;

e Second, by failing to treat Claimants’ investments transparently and

consistently; and

e Third, by failing to act in good faith towards the Claimants and their

investments.**

The Claimants assert that the ECT’s FET standard includes multiple sub-standards,
comprised of the protection of legitimate expectations, consistency and transparency, and
good faith. They argue that any one of the violations alleged above, standing alone,
would breach the FET standards, and that the Spalmaincentivi Decree and the other
Challenged Measures violated FET in each of those ways.°°’ Specifically, the Claimants
assert that the Respondent can be found to have breached FET by either of the three sub-
standards above or, alternatively, the same act may be found to have breached FET in one
or more different ways (although the Claimants have focused on what they say are the most

obvious ways in which the Challenged Measures violate FET).*°*

The Claimants contend that academic commentary and several cases confirm that states
may breach the FET standard by various types of misconduct. Thus, say the Claimants,

undermining legitimate expectations is only one type of conduct by which a state can

violate the FET standard.*° The Claimants assert that it is telling that the Respondent does

case.>”

b. The Respondent’s Arguments

440. The Respondent argues that “only legitimate expectations, and partially transparence [sic],

play an effective autonomous role in FET clause. The Respondent rejects an

interpretation of FET that would create autonomous obligations to treat foreign investments
“consistently” and with “good faith,” respectively.*”* The Respondent contests the three
sub-standards that the Claimants say are within FET, and asserts that FET is composed of
various obligations, such as the obligation to act under due process and to not infringe
legitimate expectations.*”* According to the Respondent, “there is simply no established
Tribunals’ practice in favour of [the Claimants’ ] interpretation of the FET standard.”°”4 For
the Respondent, the key issue is whether the Claimants’ second and third sub-standards

under FET — transparency/consistency and good faith, respectively, are relevant in this

particular case to the question of whether the Respondent’s conduct amounts to a violation

of FET.*”>

The Respondent argues that the Challenged Measures are heterogeneous and were taken
by different organs and bodies, at different and sometimes distant times, and therefore the
Claimants are wrong in alleging that the Measures formed part of a common plan to first
entice, then claw back, investments in Italy’s PV sector.°”° The Respondent explains that
its arguments “autonomously address” each of the Challenged Measures which the

Claimants contend violated each of the three FET sub-standards.*””

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimants assert that the FET standard is comprised of a number of different
components, while the Respondent contends that the FET standard is an independent and
autonomous standard which turns on the investor’s legitimate expectations and, to a more

limited extent, on the transparency of the state’s conduct.

In the Tribunal’s view, little turns on the Respondent’s interpretive arguments that the FET
standard comprises a single autonomous standard based on legitimate expectations and
transparency, as opposed to whether it has three distinct but overlapping elements, as
argued by the Claimants. As various tribunals have pointed out, FET is made up of several
components, including the duty to create stable conditions, to act in a transparent and
consistent manner (with due process and in good faith), and to refrain from taking arbitrary
or discriminatory measures or from frustrating investors’ legitimate expectations regarding
the legal, regulatory, and legislative framework and adversely affecting their
investments.*”* The next question is the scope of the host state’s obligations in respect of

these aspects of FET, and in the context of the unique facts and circumstances of this case.

The Tribunal finds that the FET standard includes multiple sub-standards, including the
protection of legitimate expectations, consistency and transparency, and good faith. While
there is significant overlap in the facts applicable to the allegations under these distinct
elements of FET, the Tribunal will analyse the Claimants’ claims separately under each of

these headings.

LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS (ISSUE 4.1(B))

The Claimants say that each of the Challenged Measures violated their legitimate
expectations generated by the Conto Energia and the Off-Take (MGP) incentive regimes
contained in the Respondent’s legislation and regulations, and the notices and agreements
these provided for.*”? The Claimants also rely on communications from Italy’s government

and regulatory authorities describing and supporting the two regimes.

As will be discussed in greater detail below, the Claimants say that the Conto Energia
regime created the legitimate expectation that the incentives, in particular the tariffs and
their payment terms, once granted would be honoured and remain constant for the duration
of the 20-year term.**° Similarly, the Claimants say that the Off-Take Regime created the
legitimate expectation that the MGP would remain available, free from direct or indirect
reduction, to its qualifying investments and above a certain competitive threshold.**! The
Claimants did not specify in their pleadings or at the Hearing for how long they expected
the MGP to remain available, except to say that they expected the MGP would continue at
a level reasonably equivalent to that which it had been for the six years prior to the
challenged reduction and, in any event, to remain above market price. However, the

Tribunal notes from the Claimants’ quantum calculations that they seem to have based their

state’s conduct under both the legitimate expectations and transparency/consistency standards of FET). See also
Dolzer and Schreuer: CL-061.1, p. 145.

As the Tribunal has found that it does not have jurisdiction with respect to the Robin Hood Tax and the

reclassification of PV plants as immovable property, it will not address the Claimants’ allegations in respect of these
Challenged Measures.

damages in relation to the MGP for the full 20-year period under the Conto Energia

Decrees. **

As will be described below, the Respondent denies that the Claimants had any legitimate
expectations arising out of the Conto Energia and Off-Take regimes, or that any of the

Challenged Measures violated any legitimate expectations the Claimants may have had.
The Tribunal examines each regime in turn.

dd) Nature of the Conto Energia Regime
a. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants say that the Conto Energia regime is an ex ante, at risk regime which
provided for fixed incentive tariff (FIT) rates. They say that Legislative Decree Nos.
387/2003°*3 and 28/2011 (the Romani Decree)*** provided a general framework for
incentives to implement EU directives.*** Those legislative decrees instructed the relevant
Italian ministries to develop the specifics of the incentive regime which included specific
tariff rates for the purpose of ensuring “fair remuneration of each investment and operating

costs.”58°

The Conto Energia Decrees implemented the instructions given in Legislative Decree Nos.
387/2003 and 28/2011 by establishing the detailed framework and rules to govern PV
facilities, including, inter alia, the specific incentive tariff rates and their duration. As those
legislative decrees did not themselves specify the conditions in which the tariffs would
apply or the specific level of remuneration to be covered by the tariffs, investors had to
look to the Conto Energia Decrees. In response to the Respondent’s argument that

investors should have relied on the legislative decrees which provided only for a “fair

return on the costs of investment and operations,” rather than the Conto Energia Decrees,
the Claimants say that the legislative decrees explicitly instruct Italy’s ministries to
establish specific mechanics and details of the incentive support they mandate. The Conto

Energia Decrees provided all the necessary details on which investors relied.**”

451. Further, the Claimants say that Legislative Decree Nos. 387/2003 and 28/2011 require the
relevant ministries to provide specific incentive rates so as to ensure fair remuneration of
each investment and operating costs.*** These legislative decrees do not refer to a “fair
return,” as argued by the Respondent.**? The Claimants say that the legislative decrees do
not refer to returns at all.*°? In this regard, the Claimants distinguish between returns that
can only be assessed in hindsight, after the actual costs of performance of a facility are
known, and remuneration which is generally established or agreed ex ante, with the returns
on any particular project flowing as a result of the remuneration, costs and performance of
a project.*?! The Claimants say that the legislative decrees are very clear in specifying that
the Ministries were required to set rates in a forward-looking process by requiring them to
“provide a specific incentive rate, decreasing amount and duration as to ensure fair
remuneration of each investment and operating costs.”°°? This required the Ministries to
fix rates ex ante rather than ex post to achieve a specific return based on cost and
performance.***

452. The Claimants say that none of the usual elements of an ex post, return-based compensation
regime are present in either the legislative decrees or the Conto Energia Decrees.** For
example, such a regime must define what constitutes a fair return such that investors can

make decisions on what return to expect.** In addition, an ex post, return-based regime

requires extensive provisions and procedures for determining the allowable costs and the
performance basis on which the return is calculated, and the procedures for reviewing and

revising applicable tariff rates.°°°

The Claimants say that the Respondent could have enacted an ex post return-based
compensation regime, but the legislative decrees and their implementation by the Conto
Energia Decrees make it clear that it did not.**” Rather, the Respondent provided for
specific tariff rates prospectively, which permitted investors to decide whether to invest
and to plan their investments based on the tariff rates provided.*** The Claimants say that
because PV plants require significant levels of upfront capital or “sunk costs,” investors
need to know the applicable tariff rates and their duration in advance of deciding to

invest.°”

b. The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent says that the incentives regime for PV energy was governed by Legislative
Decree 387/2003 (covering Conto I-III) and Article 24o0f Legislative Decree
28/2011 (covering Conto IV and V) which provided only for “a fair return on the costs of
investment and operation.”®° The Respondent says the Claimants focus solely on the
secondary, Conto Energia Decrees, which are not autonomous, primary legislative sources.
According to the Respondent, the governing policy and rules are set out in Legislative
Decree Nos. 387/2003 and 28/2011 which provided only for a “fair return” or “fair
remuneration” under the incentive schemes they established. In this regard, the Respondent
maintained as follows:

Claimants should have relied on the stability of the scheme assigning specific

echelons of rates based on the kind of plant, rather than on the stability of the

individual rates. This is what Claimants should have correctly understood from

relevant legislation and consistently with the Italian regulatory framework of
ministerial decrees and implementation measures by the GSE. As it was illustrated

above, both Legislative Decree 387/2003 and Legislative Decree 28/2011 only
ensured to investors specific ranges of rates (with decreasing amount and
duration) that would ensure a fair return on the costs of investment and operation
based on the type of system.°°!

[T]he notion of “fair remuneration” is in fact central to the scheme of incentives
under Italian law. This was made explicit since Legislative Decree 387/2003. As
the Respondent has explained in its Memorials and its legal experts and witnesses
have confirmed and strengthen in their reasoning, any investor entering the Italian
market had to be aware of the fact that Conto Energia were secondary measures
to be interpreted under the primary legislation that they implemented. Anyone
familiar with Italian law should have known that the scope of ministerial decrees
was limited by the mandate indicated by the legislative decree they implemented
and that “fair remuneration” was indeed the very parameter to establish such a

scope. Moreover, this responds to economics behind any subsidy of the kind at

issue... .?

Neither the legislative decrees nor the Conto Energia Decrees define or identify a “fair
return” or “fair remuneration.” In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent identified a
benchmark for assessing fair remuneration of a PV plant as the Weighted Average Cost of
Capital (“WACC”) used by the AEEG to define tariffs that ensure a fair return on capital
for energy utilities; a range it determined to be between 5.3 — 6.6%.°°? The Respondent
also submits that the Claimants’ interpretation of the Conto Energia incentive scheme
eliminates all market or demand risk on the PV producer (since the GSE purchases all
energy produced), and also removes all regulatory risk on the producer by way of fixed

tariffs."

The Respondent says that the concept of “fair return” was the key parameter in the

legislative decrees and was intended to permit fine tuning of the regime, including

Claimants’ Counter-Memorial, § 462.
RPHB, 39.
Respondent's Counter-Memorial, | 480. The utilities which the AEEG reviewed were gas and electrical

sion and distribution. This benchmark and the comparison to utilities was criticized by the Claimants’ experts,

FTI: see FTI R2, 4%] 3.37-3.51 where they identify the differences between electricity and gas transmission and
distribution and PV plants and the different schemes regulating the charges of utilities and the incentive tariffs of PV
plants. In their first financial report, the Respondent's experts suggested that the fair rate of return of solar PV plants
in Italy is the yield of the treasury bond of equivalent duration: see GRIF Q1 Expertise B, p. 8. The Claimants’ experts,
FTI, contested this stating that it would be unreasonable to expect any investor to choose to invest in building a PV
plant as opposed to buying government bonds if the two alternatives offered the same level of expected rate of return:
see, FTI R2, 4 3.55. At the Hearing, the Respondent’s experts appeared to accept this: see Hearing Transcript, Day 4,
786-787.

subsidies in the form of tariffs which by definition distort competition and generate
overcompensation.°°> The Respondent says that investors could only rely on the overall
stability of the incentive regime and the fact that incentives could guarantee a fair return
and be granted for the average life span of PV plants. The Respondent points to the Salva
Alcoa Decree as an example of an unexpected regulatory amendment which would work
to the benefit of investors as an example of the permitted modification or fine tuning of the
regime.°° In describing the nature of the incentive scheme, the Respondent argued that it
is an ex ante scheme in which the state maintains the right to make adjustments as a general

principle of law, as stated in Legislative Decree Nos. 387/2003 and 28/2011.”

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis

In the Tribunal’s view, the legislative and regulatory framework established an ex ante
regime which provided for fixed incentive rates for qualifying PV facilities for a period of
20 years. The framework for the regime was established in Legislative Decree Nos.
387/2003 and 28/2011, which provided instructions to the relevant Ministries to adopt
decrees to define the criteria and implement the modalities for the incentive tariffs. The
instructions in the legislative decrees were general, and the details required to implement

the mandate given were left to the discretion of the Ministries.

Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, which applied to Contos I-III, provided, in relevant part,

as follows:

Article 7 — Specific Provisions for Photovoltaic Energy

Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 179-181; Respondent’s Opening Presentation, Slides 42-47.
Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 621:14-21. The Respondent’s counsel explained as follows: “It is, in our

understanding, an ex ante scheme, and in a way we just get to more precise questions that I have for you, it is an ex
ante scheme where the state maintains the right to make these adjustments as a general principle of law, which is
clearly stated in the Legislative Decrees which is primary law under Italian law, that this will be the way this has to
be understood.” See also Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 619:5-11 Respondent’s Counsel stated as follows: Italy
“guaranteed a stable mechanism where tariffs were supposed to be stable, and that in a regulatory market you can still
have some remodulations, some adjustments, which are proportionate and reasonable as long as they maintain the
benchmark of a fair return. “Equa remunerazione” — that was the language of the Legislative Decree.”

(2). The criteria ... shall:

(d) establish the modalities for determining the scope of incentives. For
electricity produced by photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, provide a
specific incentive rate, decreasing amount and duration as to ensure fair
remuneration of each investment and operating costs ...*

Legislative Decree No. 28/2011 (the Romani Decree) was similar, and directed the relevant
Ministries to adopt a decree specifying incentive tariffs on the basis of the following
general criteria:

(a) The incentive has the purpose of ensuring a fair remuneration of the investment

and operational costs;

(b) the period for which a right to the incentive is given is equal to the average

conventional useful life of the specific type of power plant and runs from the start-

up date of the same;

(c) the incentive remains constant for the entire period for which the right to the

incentive is given and can take into account the economic value of the energy
produced.

The Romani Decree also provided more specifically with respect to PV plants that the
ministerial decree to be issued should include a determination of an annual limit of the
cumulative electricity capacity of PV power plants that could receive the incentive rates.
Italy provided that the incentives determined by the Ministries could take into account the

value of the energy produced and would remain constant for its entire incentive period.*!”

A review of the provisions of the Conto Energia Decrees indicates that the relevant
Ministries implemented the instructions given in Legislative Decree Nos. 387/2003 and
28/2011. They detailed the criteria for qualifying, applying for and receiving specific

incentive tariffs which were to “remain constant” for a term of 20 years (the average

conventional useful life of PV plants). The relevant criteria and tariffs were also confirmed

in the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements provided for in the Conto Energia Decrees.

The Conto Energia Decrees further provided time limits by which applications for
participation in the incentive scheme had to be made and the conditions which had to be
met in order for a producer to qualify for the tariff, and for payment of tariffs to commence.
The Conto Energia Decrees also provided for decreasing fixed tariff rates for new eligible

facilities after the expiry of the initial qualifying period on a going forward basis.

The Conto Energia Decrees, the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements all specify the tariff
rates for which a qualifying producer is entitled for the term of 20 years and make no
reference to a rate of return, the calculation of costs or a profit, or other form of regulated
return to Producers. Further, the Conto Energia Decrees make no reference to the

modification, adjustment or remodulation of the specific tariff rates set out therein.°!!

Finally, the Tribunal notes that there was no evidence that when Legislative Decree
Nos. 387/2003 and 28/2011 or the Conto Energia Decrees were adopted a particular rate
of return for qualifying producers of renewable energy, and in particular PV plants, was

considered or identified.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the incentive tariff scheme implemented by the
Legislative Decrees and the Conto Energia Decrees was an ex ante regime which provided

for specific fixed tariff rates for a period of 20 years for qualifying investors.

The Tribunal now turns to the Conto Energia Decrees and the procedures they put in place,

and what assurances or commitments, if any, they provided to the Claimants.

In this regard, the Tribunal accepts the analysis of the Claimants’ regulatory experts, FTI: see FTI R2,

4 6.19-6.51. See also Claimants’ Comments to New Legal Authorities, | 16; Greentech: CL-212, 449. The
Greentech tribunal considered the same defenses that Italy has put forward in the present case (“fair return” and right
to regulate allowed “fine tuning”), and also found that Italy’s assurances were not subject to any reservation of a
discretion to change the rates.

(2) What Legitimate Expectations Did the Claimants Have Arising From the
Conto Energia Regime?
In their respective submissions, the Parties agree that an infringement of an investor’s
legitimate expectations leads to a violation of the FET standard.°'? Both Parties referred to
the Parkerings v. Lithuania award, where the tribunal identified three scenarios in which a
host state can create legitimate expectations in an investor:
i) When the investor received an explicit promise or guarantee from a government

body as to a particular legal or regulatory provision;

ii) When the investor received implicit promises or guarantees that it took into
account in making its investment; or

iii) Absent such assurances or representations, the circumstances surrounding the
investment were such as to give rise to a legitimate expectation.°

The Parties differ as to whether the Conto Energia regime created any legitimate

expectations in the Claimants.

a. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants argue that the promises, assurances, representations, guarantees or
commitments attributable to the state may be explicit or implicit, but that the crucial point
is whether the state contributed to the creation of reasonable expectations.°'* They say that
their claim qualifies on all three prongs of the Parkerings v. Lithuania standard, set out
above, particularly the first prong because of the explicit promises of stability set out in
Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and, more specifically, in the five implementing Conto
Energia Decrees, which were reinforced by the GSE Letters and the GSE Agreements. The
Claimants submit that explicit commitments or assurances were also made through public

statements or declarations by state officials or authorities.

The Claimants assert that they relied on the specific assurances or commitments given by

the Respondent in the Conto Energia Decrees, which defined a specific “constant” tariff

rate that would be paid upon the commissioning of a qualifying PV plant. In particular, the

Claimants drew the Tribunal’s attention to the following wording of Contos II — IV:

Conto II, Article 6(1): the tariff identified on the basis of [the table at Article 6(2)]
is awarded for a period of [20] years commencing from the date of entry into
operation of the plant and shall remain constant in currency for the entire [20] year
period. [C-065]

Conto III, Article 8(4): the tariff identified on the basis of Table A and of the
provisions of paragraph 2, is awarded for a period of [20] years commencing from
the operational date of the plant and shall remain constant in current currency for
the entire incentive period. [C-145]

Conto IV, Article 12(1) and (2): (1) [flor electricity produced by solar
photovoltaic plants under this title, the plant operator (soggetto responsabile) will
be entitled to a tariff identified pursuant to the provisions of [A]nnex 5. (2) The
tariff is awarded for a period of [20] years commencing from the operational date
of the plant and shall remain constant in current currency for the entire incentive
period. [C-169]

471. The Claimants say that they relied on the terms of the Conto Energia Decrees and invested
on the basis that if a plant qualified under the requirements of a specific Conto, it had the
right to receive the specified tariff for 20 years. They say that this was confirmed in the
GSE Letters and GSE Agreements. For the Claimants, the meaning of the provisions of the
Conto Energia Decrees was clear and required no further assurance or confirmation.
Nevertheless, they say that statements by various government officials and agencies
confirmed their understanding of the language of the Conto Energia Decrees.°'> The
Claimants also say that the various due diligence reports they obtained from counsel
confirmed their understanding of the legal framework for their investments, in particular
the stable nature of the tariffs and their duration.°!® The Claimants also referred to a series

understanding of the nature of the incentive tariff regime.°'”

(i) Timing of the Making of the Claimants’ Investments

473. The Claimants say that, at the time they made their decision to invest in the various PV
companies and facilities they acquired, they held the expectation that the specific tariff
rates for which their PV plants qualified would be guaranteed and remain constant for the
20-year term. The Claimants point to the Greentech v. Italy majority’s finding that “at the
time of investing, Claimants had been led to believe, reasonably, that the incentive tariffs
would remain the same as promised in the Conto Energia Decrees, GSE letters and GSE
Agreements throughout a [20] year period.”°!? The Claimants say that their expectations
were the same for all of their plants. From 2009, when they first decided to invest,
throughout the entire investment period, each of the Claimants understood that there was a
tisk that the Respondent could decrease Conto Energia tariffs for plants not yet
commissioned and connected to the grid, but that once a plant met the requirements under

a particular Conto the entitlement to the tariff for 20 years was irrevocable.

The Claimants explain that, like in the present case, both the Greentech v. Italy and CEF
v. Italy claimants acquired many plants during their development phase (before completion
and connection to the grid), and thus before Italy had executed GSE Agreements with those
plants.®?° Also like the Claimants here, the Greentech v. Italy and CEF v. Italy claimants
acquired some plants after a previous owner had completed them, and thus after GSE
Agreements had been executed.°*! In Greentech v. Italy, the tribunal concluded that
whether a claimant invested in plants during development, as opposed to plants acquired
after the GSE Agreement was in hand, was not relevant to its legitimate expectations
analysis, and ultimately found that Italy had violated the claimant’s legitimate expectations
to stable tariffs for 20 years for al/ of claimant’s plants.? The Claimants contest and
specifically address the dissenting opinion in Greentech v. Italy, which advanced the view
that the legitimate expectations analysis should differ depending on whether a particular
plant already had received the GSE Agreement at the time of the claimant’s acquisition.°”?
The Claimants also disagree with the approach of the SunReserve v. Italy tribunal in respect

of timing of investments.°**

The Claimants urge the Tribunal to disregard what they refer to as the CEF v. Italy
tribunal’s “timing test.”°> The Claimants argue that the CEF v. Italy tribunal erred in
drawing an “illogical and unsustainable” distinction between the plants acquired during
development phase / before entry into operation and GSE Agreements, and the plants
acquired after entry into operation and GSE Agreements, which the tribunal characterized

as having “crystallized rights” specifically through the GSE Agreements.®° In this regard,

the time of investment, perhaps because the tribunal did not think the issue was germane to its decision, but that it is
evident that the investments at issue included plants that were still in development at the time of acquisition: see

the CEF v. Italy tribunal held that the Claimants only had legitimate expectations of stable

tariffs for 20 years, which Italy violated, in relation to the plants they acquired with GSE

Agreements already in place.

627

For the Claimants, CEF v. Italy’s “timing test” is wrong because “both the precise tariff

amounts each plant was entitled to receive and the [20] year duration in which the tariffs

were to remain ‘constant’ were set forth in the [Conto Energia Decrees] and formed the

basis of the decision to invest at the outset.”°* The Claimants also point out that Italy

promoted the stability of the Conto Energia Decrees precisely to induce PV development

(“greenfield” construction of PV plants). Without the incentives “no plants would have

been constructed and Italy’s renewable energy plan to meet its EU targets would have

failed.”°? The Claimants assert that “Italy required investors to trust its promises and

guarantees by committing 85-90% of the total investment cost [of €400 million]

upfront.”°° The Claimants contend that the CEF v. Italy tribunal “lost sight of the

specificity of the broader regulatory framework” by “focusing almost exclusively on the

[GSE Agreements] as the source of legitimate expectations.”**! In so doing, the Claimants

say that the CEF v. Italy tribunal also “lost sight” of the purpose behind the Conto Energia

Decrees, and Italian officials’ inducement, “which existed at the time that CEF made its

first investment[,] and which created its expectations of stability.”°? According to the

Claimants, the CEF v. Italy tribunal “neglected to consider claimant’s actual expectations

at the time that it decided to invest in its ‘greenfield’ projects, which it should have done

for a proper legitimate expectations analysis.”°* The Claimants cite the award in

Novenergia II v. Spain, which observed that “[t]he legitimate expectations of an investor

has generally been considered to be grounded in the legal order of the host State as it stands

at the time the investor acquires or makes the investment.”°*4

477. Conversely, the Claimants also argue that the CEF v. Italy tribunal “erred by attributing
scant importance to the tariff rates and duration set out in the Conto[s],” and “failed to
appreciate the other sources that created expectations,” which were identical to those in the
GSE Agreements it held to be legitimate.*° The Claimants point out that there is no legal

principle that says expectations are only legitimate if backed by a contract.**°

478. The Claimants assert that the GSE Agreements did not change anything in relation to the
precise tariff rate or duration that plants completed by a specified deadline would receive,
which had already been promised and promoted by Italian officials.’ The GSE
Agreements were executed later, after the Claimants’ expectations had been formed as a
result of the Conto Energia Decrees and Italy’s various promotional efforts, and thus the
GSE Agreements “merely confirmed the same tariff amounts and twenty-year duration that
were set forth in the earlier Conto Energia decrees.”*** The Claimants say they understood
the tariff rate, power capacity and date of entry into operation requirements set out in, for

example, Article 8(2) of Conto III, which provided as follows:°?

The Claimants further note that Article 8(4) of Conto III stated that whatever rate the
Producer qualified for would be paid “for a period of twenty years commencing from the
operational date of the plant [and] shall remain constant in current currency for the entire

incentive period.”°*°

Using Claimant ESPF’s Carlino 1 project as an example, the Claimants set out a timeline
of their acquisition and their expectations at the time of making their investment. At the
time of Claimant ESPF’s acquisition of Carlino 1 on 20 December 2010, the 113 plants
therein were still in development /“greenfield.”“*! The Claimants say that at that time they
knew from their study of the express terms of Conto III (which they confirmed “with Italian

legal counsel at DLA Piper”)°”

and Italian officials’ statements made prior to Claimants’
acquisition,“ that plants with capacity between 20 and 200kV and which became
operational by 30 April 2011 would receive a tariff of 0.321/kWh for 20 years. Seventeen
of the Carlino 1 plants were of that capacity and entered into operation on 20 April 2011.°*
Accordingly, their entitlement to that tariff vested on the date on which those plants entered

into operation, not from the date of the GSE Agreements, some months later.“

The Claimants argue that the right to the specific tariff rate for which the Claimants’ plants
qualified was “not contingent on later executing a contract with the GSE,” nor was there
any “‘magic’ to the GSE [Agreements] in terms of Claimants’ expectations.” Rather, the
GSE Agreements were granted “as a matter of course to confirm the existence of rights
already offered, vested, and attained,” as is reflected in the following “mandatory

language” of Conto III: “[e]lectricity produced by [PV] plants under this title ... is entitled

to the incentive tariff under table A.”“*” In this regard, the Claimants assert that the GSE
had no discretion to refuse to grant or refuse to pay the Conto tariff rate to plants which
met the deadlines specified therein.™* Similarly, the GSE had no discretion to alter the
terms of the payments or to pay something other than the tariffs set out in the Conto Energia
Decrees.’ The Claimants point out that the “exact same tariffs” and 20-year duration
defined in Conto III were confirmed in the subsequent GSE Letters and GSE Agreements

to the Carlino 1 plants.°°

The Claimants say that, due to Italy’s slow bureaucracy, it took four months from the date
on which the seventeen Carlino 1 plants entered into operation for the GSE to send
Claimant ESPF the GSE Letters and seven to eleven months for the GSE Agreements, both
of which expressly confirmed that the effective date of the entitlement was the date on

which these plants entered into operation (20 April 2011).°*!

The Claimants also argue that the CEF v. Italy tribunal’s “timing test” leads to a
“fundamentally unfair result, where the ECT would protect investors in the secondary
market, who purchased completed plants, but not the investors who undertook more risk in

sinking their capital upfront to develop plants.”°?

The Claimants further state that the CEF v. Italy award fails to consider the new and distinct
“investment” which fell within the ambit of ECT protection once the claimant’s plants held
GSE Agreements.®* The Claimants say that although they acquired developing plants, they

further acquired investments in the form of “claims to money” and “rights conferred by

law or contract” (pursuant to Article 1 of the ECT) when each GSE Agreement was

executed.°4

Finally, the Claimants submit that they acquired eleven of their nineteen PV projects after
completion, and thus after the plants had rights to the tariffs according to each applicable
Conto, but before the plant operators had the GSE Agreements in hand — a scenario with
which the CEF v. Italy tribunal was not confronted.°*> The Claimants submit that even if
this Tribunal were to follow the logic in CEF, the Tribunal should find that “the rights of
those projects, which were completed and operating on the date Claimants acquired them,

had vested according to the Conto decrees on the date they entered into operation.”°*°

(ii) Relevant Date of Assessment of Expectations

With regard to pinpointing a date of assessment of the Claimants’ expectations, the
Claimants note that investment is a process which often unfolds over time, rather than a
single event which occurs on a specific date. The Claimants refer to the award in
Novenergia v. Spain, where the investor had invested in PV plants over the course of
several years. In that case, the tribunal focused on the date when the investor “had
irreversibly committed to investing” and held that it would assess the claimant’s
expectations based on the date when it acquired its first plant.°’ The Claimants point out
that other tribunals have confirmed that assurances made with respect to an investment

already made can also give rise to legitimate expectations that warrant protection.°*

Accordingly, the Claimants say that there are two possible approaches to the relevant date
for assessing their expectations. The Tribunal could look at the date of each Claimant’s

first acquisition of a PV plant on the basis that the investment objective was to build a

Claimants’ Comments on New Legal Authorities, § 33.
CPHB, {ff 31-32, citing, inter alia, Novenergia v. Spain: CL-195, 4 539. Conversely, the Claimants criticize

the approach of the SunReserve v. Italy tribunal for having taken an overly restrictive view of the date of investment
and consequently determined that no expectations could have been held by those claimants at the time of investment:
see Claimants’ Comments on SunReserve.

portfolio of PV plants in Italy rather than to simply invest in individual projects. If that

approach were adopted, the Claimants say that the relevant dates of investment are:

15 December 2009 for ESPF; 17 June 2011 for ESPF 2; and 20 December 2010 for ICE 5.

Alternatively, the Tribunal could view each plant as a separate investment and look to the

acquisition date of each of those plants.°?

487. According to the Claimants, the choice between the two alternatives is immaterial since
the Respondent’s regulatory framework did not change materially during the relevant time
period. The Claimants say that certain of the PV plants in which they invested were
acquired before the plants had been commissioned and received the GSE Letters and GSE
Agreements.® The Claimants say that their understanding and expectation at the time they
acquired these “greenfield” facilities was that once the plants were constructed,
commissioned and connected to the grid, the specific tariff for which they qualified would
be maintained for 20 years. They say that this expectation was confirmed when each of the
plants received a GSE Letter and each of the plants entered into a GSE Agreement, both of
which refer to the applicable Conto Energia Decree’s specific tariff rate in constant terms
for 20 years. Other of the Claimants’ plants in question had already received the GSE
Letters and GSE Agreements confirming that the tariff rate was to be paid for 20 years

(namely, the Brindisi Crea, Brindisi Elios and Ginosa plants).°!

488. The Claimants say their expectations were essentially the same for all of their plants. From
the time that they first decided to invest in 2009, and throughout the entire investment
period, the Claimants understood that there was a risk that the Respondent could decrease
Conto Energia tariffs for plants not yet commissioned and connected to the grid. However,

because of the specific assurances in the Conto Energia Decrees, the Claimants understood

659 CPHB, 4 34. The specific acquisition dates for each of the Claimants’ PV plants is listed in Claimants’
Memorial, pp. 76-77.

660 According to the Claimants, KGAL, which managed each of the three Claimants, decided to invest in PV
plants in Italy by mid-2009. ESPF acquired its first plant on 15 December 2009 and ICE 5 completed the acquisition
of its first project in December 2010. ESPF2 began seeking upstream investors in mid-2010 and decided to acquire its
first portfolio of plants in May 2011: see CPHB, {| 35-37.

661 CPHB, {| 35-36. The Claimants give the example of ESPF’s decision to acquire its first plant, “Montalto”
in 2009 which was not commissioned until 28 October 2010. The Montalto plant then received its GSE confirmation
letter dated 3 May 2011 and then entered into a GSE Agreement with the GSE on 28 July 2011.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 185

that once a plant met the requirements, the Respondent would pay a constant tariff rate,
unchanged for a period of 20 years. The Claimants repeat their assertion that the
Respondent confirmed their understanding and expectations, and the legitimacy of these,
by way of the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements entered into with each of the plants in

question.

b. The Respondent’s Arguments

489. The Respondent denies that the Claimants had any of the legitimate expectations they
claim. It says that the Claimants’ claim amounts to an allegation that Italy agreed or
committed to freeze its regulatory regime. The Respondent says that there is no

stabilization clause contained in the relevant legislative decrees or the Conto Energia

Decrees, and that it did not, at any point, agree to freeze its regime or the tariff rates.

490. The Respondent refers to a number of awards where a distinction was drawn between the
stability of legislation and a freezing or stabilization clause.%* The Respondent relies on
the decision in Blusun v. Italy, which it says is of particular relevance since it considered
the Romani Decree, which forms part of the regime at issue in this case. Although the
Blusun claimants did not qualify for the tariff rates provided for in the relevant Conto

Energia Decrees in time, the Respondent says that the B/usun tribunal confirmed that

662 CPHB, 38. The Claimants note that there was a slight difference in their expectations depending on whether
the PV plant had already been commissioned at the time of investment or whether commissioning had not yet occurred
when the plants were acquired. In the first case, the Claimants expectations were based on the language in the relevant
Conto decree, the terms of the GSE Letter and the terms of the GSE Agreement signed with the GSE. In the second
case, the Claimants say they relied on the language of the Conto Energia Decree and expected that the Respondent
would honour the terms of the decree by paying the specific tariff rate for a 20-year period from the date of the plant’s
commissioning. The Claimants say that expectation was based on the language of the decree itself, the description of
the program from Italian officials and confirmation from counsel in their due diligence reports. The Claimants say
that they knew there was a risk that the tariff levels might decrease before a plant was commissioned and they accepted
and managed that risk. However, they expected that the tariff rate could not be changed after a plant was
commissioned. They say that expectation was confirmed by the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements. See CPHB, § 43.

legitimate expectations cannot arise from a generally worded regulatory measure such as
the Romani Decree. It quotes the following passage:

[U]nder international law... in the absence of a specific commitment toward

stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory

framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at any time

to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.°°

491. The Respondent criticizes the Masdar v. Spain and Greentech v. Italy awards for

“committing evident factual errors.” Italy says that the Greentech tribunal’s finding that
the Conto Energia Decrees “bear the hallmarks of ... ‘an agreement, in the form of a
stabilization clause or otherwise’” is wrong.®” Italy counters that such stabilization clause
“clearly does not exist,” which is in contrast to the relevant Spanish legislation at issue in
Masdar v. Spain, which did contain a specific statement that measures would remain
unchanged.®* Italy also endorses the approach of the SunReserve v. Italy tribunal with
respect to its findings as to a state’s ability to regulate in the face of the content of the Conto

Energia regime.°°

492. The Respondent says that there were no “specific assurances” or commitments given by it
to the Claimants. There were never any discussions between the Claimants and any Italian
authorities regarding the Claimants’ individual investments, whether directly with the
Claimants or through the Italian companies in which they invested.°” According to the
Respondent, the Claimants could only rely on the existing legislation, which provided only

for a fair return or fair remuneration.*’! The Respondent says that the

infringed their legitimate expectations based on the Conto Energia in force at the time that its tariffs would stay
unchanged for 2 more years. The Respondent says that the tribunal found the claimants’ argument in that case to be
incorrect, stating: “As such, it faces the second and more fundamental difficulty, which is that tribunals have so far

only thing that could be related to [a] “promise,” existing at the time of
investment, was the Conto Energia regime and the gratuitous incentives it granted
for [20] years. However, the incentive regime, far from being a concrete
“promise” to the Claimants, simply was a regulation, subjected from the
beginning to the Italian and EU legal order. In other words, no kind of contractual
act was made by Italy towards the Claimants before the starting of the investment.
No letter of intent. No individual promise of a special treatment. Nothing.

Therefore, there lacks the basic element of the exceptional category invoked by
the Claimants, namely the existence of an agreement, or at least a piece of [an]

agreement such as a specific promise or commitment, specifically directed to the

Claimants.67

The Respondent points out that its incentive scheme was addressed to “any investor, of any
size and nationality, was not meant to specifically induce foreigners by any means, nor
even associations representing investors played any role in negotiating measures that could

have lead [sic] to specific assurances (as was the case in Spain ...).”°7>

The Respondent also denies that the various statements and presentations to which the
Claimants refer in support of their alleged legitimate expectations are specific assurances
of the non-modifiability of the incentive tariffs. The Respondent says that these statements
were intended for the general public and made by non-lawyers (or regulators or policy
makers) and simply intended to repeat what is generally stated in the Conto Energia

Decrees.°

The Respondent criticizes the Greentech v. Italy majority finding that “Italy’s assurances
constituted non-waivable guarantees” directed at specific investors, and argues that
“putative ‘assurances’ are not conclusively stated, as they seem to be generically
determined by the Contos themselves, or otherwise assumed as existing” in contradiction

to the “application of the FET under the ECT and international law.”°”>

With respect to the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements, the Respondent says that these

cannot represent specific commitments or assurances, since the communication of these to

the individual plant operators were simply implementing the Conto Energia regime.” The
Respondent also argues that the GSE Agreements are mere accessory agreements, and thus

had no force in law to confirm the terms of the Conto Energia Decrees.°””

The Respondent takes issue with the CEF v. Italy tribunal’s ruling that the claimant had
legitimate expectations (which were subsequently violated by Italy) in relation to its one
plant which already had a GSE Agreement in hand at the time the claimant acquired it.°”

RPHB, 447.
Respondent's Counter-Memorial, {fj 321, 533. The Respondent also contests the Claimants’ argument that

the GSE Agreements were private law contracts. It says that the Romani Decree, which referred to the GSE
Agreements going forward as “private law contracts,” applied only to agreements adopted as of 31 December 2012,
under Conto V: see RPHB, {f] 48-53. See also Respondent’s Rejoinder, § 391:

.. the GSE [Agreements], as explained in the Counter-Memorial and repeated
here as confirmed by the Italian Constitutional Court No 162017 on the Spalma-
incentivi, are merely accessory contracts (“contratti accessori” 0 “accessivi”),
which simply absorb legal provisions. The parties do not autonomously determine
the essential elements of the agreement, which are established outside the contract
by the legislative and/or regulatory act they depend from. Accordingly, GSE
[Agreements] should be understood as a sort of appendix of legislative or
regulatory provisions. In sum, these agreements are structurally different from the
sources of obligation usually negotiated with a foreign investor and necessitating
to be ‘internazionalized’ [sic] to receive protection under the ECT.

See also Respondent’s Rejoinder, fn: 159 (emphasis in original):

. an accessory contract ... establishes the operational rules to implement the
relevant public measure it is connected to. By definition, this regulates
autonomously a number of matters, but it depends on the vicissitudes of the latter,
which can be the subject of revision, self-defense, or revocation because of public
interest. As a general definition, “accessory” are those contracts governing
reciprocal duties of parties that arise from a public measures [sic]. To a phase of
authoritative exercise of public powers, it follows one built under the scheme of

i ip: whereas the authoritative exercise of power establist
the legal situation, the instrument regulates its operation. Even
assuming that, because of these two sides, such a contract is “mixed” in nature,
this would in fact mean that the management of the executive aspects of the
relationship are regulated by private law, whereas the contract keeps a public
nature. In particular, this would not change the fact that the particular nature of
the subject matter of the contract (public interest), and its object (the management
of this interest), leave intact a position of supremacy by the public power that
would make it possible for the latter to_uni modify its conditions by
modifying the authoritative act.

incentives (as recognized in B/usun in relation to the previous Romani Decree), — had to be
aware of possible amendments of regulation also affecting existing rights.”°”? The
Respondent says that the CEF v. Italy tribunal “seems to assume that the fact that
contractual rights in a regulated marked [sic] could be legitimately modified by the State
was only established by Italian Constitutional Court 16/2017,” which it says is “incorrect,
and the opposite was proved ... much earlier by other Constitutional Court decisions.”°*°
The Respondent urges the Tribunal to take the approach of the SunReserve v. Italy tribunal
in determining the nature of the GSE Agreements and the extent to which legitimate

expectations could be based upon those agreements.°*!

(i) Relevant Date of Assessment of Expectations

With respect to the relevant date for the assessment of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, the Respondent says that it must be the time of the making of the investment.
The Respondent argues that since 80-90% of the investment cost in PV plants is incurred
up front, and financing therefore needs to be obtained at an early stage, most of an
investment is made before the investor can concretely rely on a specific Conto Energia
Decree. At that stage, the investor can only rely on the macro stability of the system, which
Italy could adjust provided that the standard of fair remuneration is maintained. The
Respondent says that the developer has to bear a regulatory risk since it cannot rely on
fixed tariffs at the time it makes its investment. According to the Respondent, the Claimants
“exclude any possibility to apply Greentech, since they admit themselves that ‘Italy made
no guarantees of specific incentive rates with respect to PV facilities under

development,””6*

However, where an investor purchases a plant which has already been built, commissioned

and connected to the grid, it takes no development or construction risk, which, according

to the Respondent, affects the price of acquisition.®*? Nevertheless, such a purchase of a
plant on the “secondary market” does not eliminate the regulatory risk since the purchaser
has invested in a regulated market in which the Respondent had intervened several times.°**
The Respondent suggests that investors, such as the Claimants, purchasing on the
“secondary market” do not face the same risks as investors developing and constructing
PV plants.°*> Therefore, the Claimants’ argument that they face sunk costs which are
“trapped” is false.°*° Nevertheless, the Respondent says that investors on the secondary
market bear the same regulatory risk as any other operator in a regulated market and

“should be able to read legislative sources in the same way as developers.”°*”

(ii) Timing of the Making of Claimants’ Investments

For the Respondent, legitimate expectations for entitlement to an incentive tariff “can arise
only once the investor becomes entitled to such incentive,” which occurs, “uncontroverted
... under Italian law only once a plant becomes operational”®** (a proposition with which
the Tribunal notes that the Claimants agree). However, the Respondent goes on to argue,
in reliance on the tribunal’s award in CEF v. Italy, that the Claimants’ entitlement vests
only once the Claimants have a GSE Agreement in hand for that particular plant. The
Respondent relies on the CEF award for the proposition that, at the time of investment in
greenfield operations, the investor could have no legitimate expectation that it would

necessarily be awarded the incentives“? The Respondent argues that the CEF v. Italy

award is dispositive of the Claimants’ “attempt to state that since ex post it is proved that

they did obtain entitlement [under a particular Conto], such fact would back-date the time

of entitlement.”°°

The Respondent argues that the dissenting opinion in Greentech v. Italy and the decisions
in both the CEF and SunReserve awards “massively contradict ]” the claimant-favourable
rulings on legitimate expectations in Greentech.®! The Respondent advances the view that
the CEF award, read in conjunction with the Greentech dissent “take to reject all the claims
of the Claimants in these proceedings.”°? The Respondent says that “even under the
assumption that an investment is a process and not necessarily a single shot ... it is
undisputed that the big majority of transactions ... described by the Claimants occurred

before obtaining either the GSE [L]etter or the GSE [Agreement].”°?

 

(iii)Alleged Inad y of the Claii ’ Due Dili

q

The Respondent says that due diligence on the stability of the regulatory framework is
particularly important in the case of an acquisition of a completed and connected plant.°*
According to the Respondent, “a firm principle should be that in case of an acquisition the
acquirer has to verify the soundness of all titles it acquires together with the target,” such
that “[i]Jnvestors should be responsible to ask the relevant legal questions to their lawyers,
not being exonerated from liability because they did not ask the right questions or these

were not fully elaborated by their legal counsels.”®°

The Respondent alleges that the due diligence undertaken by the Claimants was
inadequate.°° It says that the due diligence reports submitted by the Claimants only
confirm the status of ownership of the land or that construction permits were obtained, but
that due diligence on the tariff system itself was not undertaken.©” The Respondent says
that if the due diligence reports had been undertaken by competent Italian lawyers, they
would have warned the client that in Italy legislation can affect long term relationships,

including in the renewable energy sector. In those circumstances, appropriate due diligence

modifying the terms of the incentive regime.®*® The Respondent points out that certain of
the due diligence reports submitted by the Claimants refer to public sector approvals,
regulatory risks and the price of electricity risk as well as possible “unforeseeable

changes.”

The Respondent also refers to the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision, which it says
confirms the principle of Italian law that legislation can affect long term relationships
notwithstanding the expectations of a party.”° The Respondent argues that, “a reasonable
investor, especially when entering a regulated market, should be aware that the legal
landscape might vary and that a state has a general right to regulate” and that “[s]tability
would thus not automatically imply fixity ... unless the state has clearly undertaken a

stabilization clause.”7"!

of changes for investors not being entitled to incentives. It only does so for the plant that

Hearing Transcript, Day 4, 886:13-25; Respondent's Closing Presentation, Slide 11. The Respondent also

points to a memorandum, which states in part as follows:

In principle, it cannot be ruled out that the current legal situation in the individual
target countries will change and the property companies will accept, or not at all,
sell the electricity generated by the photovoltaic systems on less favourable terms
than in the forecasts due to inapplicability, cancellation or other interpretation of
the provisions currently governing the participation. For example, should the
property companies be required in the future to dispose of the electricity on the
open market contrary to the consensually assumed assumptions (compensation of
the energy generated at the statutory rate) and/or the benchmarks relevant for the
annual price adjustment of the statutory tariff (for example, a consumer price
index), there is a risk of a deterioration in the profitability of the investment,
including total loss ... property companies bear the risk that business restrictions
may be imposed by government authorities, therefore resulting in lost revenues.
In addition, there is the risk of other, currently unforeseeable changes in the
respective country’s laws, which could have adverse effects on the operation of
the photovoltaic facilities and thus on the results arising from the investment (see
also in this regard the note on the risk [of changes in the] price of electricity.

the investor acquired when it had already obtained entitlement and signed the GSE
[Agreements].””°? The Respondent says this means that the Tribunal need only proceed
further in its legitimate expectations analysis “for extremely few plants.”’°> The
Respondent goes on to refer to the dissenting opinion in Greentech v. Italy, which states:
(i) the Conto Energia Decrees were not specifically addressed to investors and Italy could
change them; (ii) the GSE Agreements, although more specific, are “of a ‘lower’ legal
force” under Italian law; (iii) the incentives are not self-standing subsidies, which was or
ought to have been known to investors since “the [EC] target had been met years head [sic]
thanks to the generosity of the incentives which in turn had brought about a rush of
investments;””* (iv) the Conto Energia Decrees regime was “quite onerous” on Italy’s
economy, which made “the reduction of the burden desirable;” and, therefore, (v) it was
“prudent for an informed investor to envisage the possibility that some adjustments might
be introduced subsequently, thereby affecting the reliance on the stability of the existing
scheme” and a prudent investor “should have foreseen that a limited tariff modification
might have been subsequently enacted” since “changes were ... not unpredictable.””°° The
Respondent states that the Greentech v. Italy Dissent is consistent with CEF v. Italy and
“with the mainstream of prior awards against other Member States.””°° Further, the
Respondent relies on the Belenergia v. Italy award for the proposition that “Italian
legislation does not contain any specific commitments, let alone stabilization clauses,
creating legitimate expectations that tariffs could never be modified by the regulator,””””
as well as the SunReserve v. Italy award, which also held that there could be no legitimate

expectations based on the Italian legislation.”°°

506. With respect to the provisions of the Conto Energia Decrees, the Respondent accepts that
it is in these decrees that the rate and duration of the incentives are established. It says that
the duration of 20 years, the average useful life of PV plants, is a reasonable period to

ensure a fair return on the costs of investment and operation of plants.’°

507. With respect to the constancy or stability of the rate, the Respondent says that the reference
to a “constant” incentive rate means that its monetary value is not subject to updating in
accordance with inflation rates.” In this regard, the Respondent provides the following
translation of Article 12(2) of Conto IV: “The incentive rate is valid for a period of
twenty years from the date of entry into operation of the plant and is constant at current
prices for the whole period of the incentives.”’!! In addition, the Respondent says that
Article 24(2) of Legislative Decree 28/2011 provides that a “constant” incentive means
that the monetary value is not subject to updates with inflation rates and refers to a
2010 publication by the Italian Federation for the Rational Use of Energy which states that
the ”... incentive fee is payable recognized for 20 years and remains in constant currency,
thus not [to] be updated with the inflation rate.”’!” The Parties agree that only Conto I had
an inflation adjustment and that this provision was removed in the subsequent Conto

Energia Decrees.”°

“The incentive rate is valid for a period of twenty years from the date of entry into operation and is constant in currency
for the whole term incentive.” The Italian original reads as follows: “La tariffa incentivante é riconosciuta per un

had qualified for those tariffs. The majority of the Tribunal finds that, at the time they
invested, the Claimants had the legitimate expectation that the PV plants in which they
invested would benefit from the specific tariff set out in the relevant Conto Energia
Decrees and then reflected in the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements for a period of

20 years.

There are various ways in which a state can make an explicit promise or assurance. In
elaborating on what would give rise to a legitimate expectation, the tribunal in Micula v.
Romania stated that “[t]he crucial point is whether the state, through statements or conduct,
has contributed to the creation of a reasonable expectation, in this case, a representation of

regulatory stability.”7!*

It is undisputed in this case that the object and purpose of Italy’s Conto Energia regime
was to induce investment in its developing PV sector ahead of when that investment would
otherwise occur in light of the high cost of investment prevalent at the time. Italy had
complete control over how it designed its scheme and opted for a regime that provided
numerous incentives and support for these investments. The main defining feature was the
incentive tariff scheme, which provided a constant income stream over the expected life of
the investment. The scheme was designed to attract early investment, as it reduced the
amount of these tariffs in each successive Conto Energia Decree. Each Conto Energia
Decree provided for very specific dates by which a plant needed to be operational in order
to benefit from the FITs. There were also limits on the overall capacity that would receive
the incentives. Italy designed its FIT system in a way that allowed it to understand the
overall cost and phase out the system once that cost had been reached. Italy later decided
that its scheme was too costly for certain consumers and reduced the FIT rates it had been

paying.

The question for this Tribunal is whether Italy’s decision to reduce the FITs previously set
out in the Conto Energia Decrees relevant to the Claimants’ investments was a breach of

the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to Claimants’ investments under the

Micula v. Romania: CL-014, 4 669.

512.

513.

715

Award
Page 196

ECT. At the time that the Claimants made their investments, was it legitimate for them to

expect that Italy would not change those FITs for 20 years?

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no doubt that a clear and specific commitment is required
in order to create an enforceable legitimate expectation. However, in the majority’s view,
there is no reason in principle why such a commitment of the requisite clarity and
specificity cannot be made in the regulation itself where (as here) such a commitment is
made for the purpose of inducing investment, which succeeded in attracting the Claimants’
investments and, once made, resulted in losses to the Claimants. In these circumstances,
there is no principled reason to deny that the investor’s expectations of performance by the
state are legitimate. The clear and specific guarantee in the Conto Energia Decrees satisfies
the requisite degree of specificity needed in order for legitimate expectations to arise from
legislation. Therefore, as of the date of the Claimants’ initial investment in December
2009 (also discussed under timing at paragraphs 131 to 147), the Claimants had a
reasonable and legitimate expectation that, provided their projects complied with the Conto
Energia Decree requirements and entered into operation by applicable deadlines for the
specific tariff rates outlined in the Conto Energia Decrees, and continued to comply
throughout the 20 year duration of the incentive period, they would receive the benefits set
out in Contos II-IV. That expectation continued and was held at the time the Claimants

made each of their investments under the Conto Energia Decrees. ">

Legitimate expectations are based on the investor’s objective understanding of the legal
framework within which the investor has made its investment or, in other words, what a
reasonable investor at the time would have expected. Such legal framework includes the
host state’s domestic legislation and regulations, as well as its international law obligations,
any contractual arrangements concluded between the investor and the state, and the specific

representations or undertakings made by the state.

The Tribunal notes that a number of tribunals have also found that certain legitimate expectations of an

investor can arise from the legal framework — the legislation and regulations — in force at the time an investment was
made: see, e.g., Masdar v. Spain: CL-200, 4512.

One of the elements of the procedure established by Italy in the present case was the
registration of the completed PV plant with the GSE on the date on which the plant entered
into operation. All of the Claimants’ plants duly entered into operation within the
prescribed “window” under each of the applicable Conto Energia Decrees. The Tribunal
finds that the Claimants’ investments having met the specific preconditions and
requirements set out in the Conto Energia Decrees to qualify for the related tariffs, it was
legitimate for the Claimants to expect that those tariffs would be paid for the following

reasons.

First, the specific and mandatory language of, e.g., Conto III states that “electricity
produced by [PV] plants under this title ... is entitled to the incentive tariff under table
A.”"© The Conto Energia Decrees do not contain any reservation giving the GSE
discretion to refuse to grant or refuse to pay the Conto tariff rate to plants which met the
deadlines specified therein.”'” Similarly, the GSE had no discretion to alter the terms of the

payments or to pay something other than the tariffs set out in the Conto Energia Decrees.”!*

Second, the majority of the Tribunal recalls each of the GSE Letters addressed to the
Claimants’ Investments after entering into operation. The exact same tariffs and 20-year
duration defined in the Conto Energia Decrees were confirmed in the subsequent GSE
Letters. The majority of the Tribunal accepts that the GSE Letters cannot form the
foundation for the Claimants’ expectations, as they did not yet exist at the time of
investment. However, the eventual issuance of these letters confirms the legitimacy of the

Claimants’ expectations created by the Conto Energia regime.

Third, the indication that the PV plant in question was to benefit from the guarantees of the
applicable Conto Energia Decrees is stated in express terms in each of the respective GSE
Agreements, specifically addressed to each of the Claimants’ Investments. That the GSE
Letters and GSE Agreements were issued after and thus not before the Claimants made

their Investments does not diminish the fact that they in fact confirm the Claimants’

legitimate expectations which arose from their review of Conto I at the time of its first
investment. While the Claimants did not have certainty that they would be successful in
completing their plants before the Respondent changed the Conto Energia Decrees, that
does not affect the specificity of the commitment contained in the Conto Energia Decrees

from which the Claimants’ legitimate expectations arose.

While the Conto Energia Decrees may not have contained promises directed at a specific
investor, they were designed to attract investment and were directed at investors who made
investments that met specific requirements on the relevant timeline. The Conto Energia
regime was not just a general framework, it provided specific incentives to investors who
met specific requirements. The Conto Energia Decrees filled in the details of Italy’s
incentive scheme, as directed by Legislative Decree No. 387. The Claimants do not argue
that the Respondent may not change its legislation. Rather, they say they relied on their
legitimate expectation held at the time of making their investments that specific rates and
duration of the FITs set out in the applicable Conto Energia Decrees would remain constant
once they met the qualifying criteria detailed in the Conto Energia Decrees. The Tribunal
recalls that this entitlement was further confirmed in the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements.
PV plants which had not met said criteria within the deadline risked the Respondent

changing the legislation for plants which had not yet entered into operation.

The Respondent drafted the legislative regime in order to attract investment and it did not
indicate that the rates provided for were subject to change or were only a proxy for a
reasonable rate of return. Thus, in light of the specificity of the tariff regime and the
Respondent’s failure to advise prospective investors that it reserved the right to adjust the
tariffs, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent created a legitimate expectation that it would
not change the tariff rates for plants that qualified under each Conto. This is not to say that
the Respondent could not change its legislation at all. In fact, it did subsequently enact

changes to the tariffs with each Conto and none of those changes are contested in this case.

However, if a change in legislation fails to take into consideration that an investor’s
legitimate expectations must be protected, although the legislation may be validly amended

as a matter of domestic law, the State may incur international liability. In the present case,

Claimants do not contend that the ECT alone prevented Italy from retroactively changing the

making those changes because Italy itself promised in the Conto Energia Decrees (which it
later repeated in the GSE Letters, GSE Agreements, and various ministerial reports) not to do

by repeatedly assuring investors that the rates would remain constant.

The majority of the Tribunal notes that the circumstances in this case bear some similarity
to the regulatory framework in Argentina that gave rise to, among others, Enron’s claims.

The Enron v. Argentina tribunal stated:

The measures in question in this case have beyond any doubt substantially
changed the legal and business framework under which the investment was
decided and implemented. Argentina in the early 1990s constructed a regulatory
framework for the gas sector containing specific guarantees to attract foreign
capital to an economy historically unstable and volatile. As part of this regulatory
framework, Argentina guaranteed that tariffs would be calculated in US dollars,
converted into pesos for billing purposes, adjusted semi-annually in accordance
with the US PPI and sufficient to cover costs and a reasonable rate of return. ...

The Tribunal observes that it was in reliance upon the conditions established by
the Respondent in the regulatory framework for the gas sector that Enron
embarked on its investment in TGS. Given the scope of Argentina’s privatization
process, its international marketing, and the statutory enshrinement of the tariff
regime, Enron had reasonable grounds to rely on such conditions.

A decade later, however, the guarantees of the tariff regime that had seduced so
many foreign investors, were dismantled. Where there was certainty and stability
for investors, doubt and ambiguity are the order of the day. The long-term
business outlook enabled by the tariff regime has been transformed into a day-to-
day discussion about what comes next. Tariffs have been frozen for almost five
years. The recomposition of the tariff regime is subject to a protracted
renegotiation process imposed on the public utilities that has failed to provide a
final and definitive framework for the operation of business in the energy
sector. 72°

The majority of the Tribunal has noted that the Claimants dispute what they say is the
stricter standard for determining what can give rise to legitimate expectations in the
Charanne y. Spain case. In their view, there is no basis for restricting the creation of

legitimate expectations to the existence of a specific commitment, either contractual in

nature or founded in statements or specific conditions declared by a state. Rather, in their
view, legitimate expectations can also be based on legislation (the legal framework) in
force at the time the investment was made. ”*! The Claimants say that the issue is academic
in this case since the Respondent did make explicit promises with respect to the Claimants’
investments in its legislative and regulatory decrees, the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements
and repeated those promises in its promotion of the Conto Energia regime. As the
Claimants base their case on the making of a specific commitment by the Respondent, the

Tribunal need not address this broader issue further.
The Tribunal also notes the tribunal’s finding in E/ Paso v. Argentina that

a commitment can be considered specific if its precise object was to give a real
guarantee of stability to the investor. Usually general texts cannot contain such
commitments, as there is no guarantee that they will not be modified in due course.
However, a reiteration of the same type of commitment in different types of
general statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific
behavior of the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the investor a
guarantee on which it can justifiably rely.”

As it has concluded above at paragraphs 457-465, the Tribunal finds that the Conto Energia
Decrees implemented Legislative Decree No. 387/2004 and Legislative Decree
No. 28/2011, which gave the relevant ministries the discretion to establish specific
incentive rates and duration so as to ensure fair remuneration of each investment and its
operating costs. The Conto Energia Decrees did this and established detailed rules for
applying, qualifying for and receiving the incentive tariffs. It is reasonable to assume that
in exercising this delegated authority, the ministries undertook appropriate steps and set
conditions and tariffs to ensure fair remuneration of the investment and operating costs of
qualifying PV plants. The Tribunal recalls that the purpose of the incentive regime was to

attract significant early investment in Italy’s nascent PV sector.

Contos II, III and IV, pursuant to which the Claimants made their investments, each set out
a tariff rate calculated to the third decimal point for a period of 20 years “constant in current

currency” for the entire incentive period, which was to coincide with the expected life ofa

PV plant. The Conto Energia Decrees set different tariff rates depending on when a PV
producer qualified for receipt of the tariff, providing lower or decreasing tariff rates if a
producer qualified after the initial incentive period. For example, Conto II, Article
6 provided that producers who qualified under the Conto prior to 31 December 2008 were
entitled to receive full incentive tariffs (ranging from €0.40 to €0.49 per kWh depending
on the capacity of the plant); producers who qualified between 2 January 2009 and
31 December 2010 were entitled to receive tariffs reduced by 2%; and producers who
qualified in the following year were entitled to receive tariffs reduced by a further 2%.”>
The specific tariff rate for which a producer qualified was confirmed in the GSE Letters
and the GSE Agreements. This implemented the direction in the legislative decrees to
provide specific tariffs of “decreasing amounts” to take into account reduction in costs of
PV technology and equipment. It also encouraged investors to make their investments

despite the higher costs earlier in order to take advantage of higher tariff amounts.

The Tribunal has considered the Respondent’s argument that the expression “constant in
current currency” (costante in moneta corrente) in Contos I-IV reflects only that, unlike
under Conto I, the adjustment of tariffs according to the consumer price index (STAT
inflation adjustment) was no longer provided for.’ In the majority’s view, while by using
the term “current” currency the expression may reflect that the tariff rates are not subject
to adjustment for inflation as they had been under Conto I, it also clearly conveys the
meaning that the tariff shall remain “constant” or unchanged for the duration of the
incentive period of 20 years. There is no indication in Contos II-IV that the specific tariff
rates for which a producer qualifies can be adjusted up or down. Rather, the language
conveys the intention that the tariff rate will apply throughout the entire 20-year incentive

period, i.e., the expected life of the investment.

The Conto Energia Decrees also specified the requirements to qualify for an incentive
tariff: the application procedure, confirmation of the granting of a specific tariff by the GSE

and the requirement to enter into an agreement with the GSE. Once all of the specific

requirements for the qualifications were met, the GSE Letters advised Producers of their
admission to the incentive tariff scheme and specified the tariff rate applicable and the
duration of 20 years. It also repeated that the tariff was constant in current currency
throughout the entire 20-year period. The confirmation letter also advised the qualifying
Producer that in order to activate the payment of tariffs, it would have to complete a GSE
Agreement available on the GSE’s web portal. The GSE Agreement, in turn, again set out
the specific tariff rate which was stated to be constant in current currency, and specified a

term of 20 years.

The Claimants say they understood that the Conto Energia Decrees established specific
tariff rates that would apply to the electricity produced by eligible plants for a fixed period
of 20 years.’?> They say that based on the language of the Conto Energia Decrees they
understood that changes to the tariffs were possible for future PV plants, but that they were
highly confident that no changes would be made to the tariff rates for plants which had: (i)
qualified for the specific tariff rates under the relevant Conto Energia Decrees; (ii) were
notified of acceptance through a GSE Letter; and (iii) entered into an agreement with the
GSE.”° According to Mr. Ebner, the Managing Director of KGAL, the Claimants relied
on the guarantee of the stability of the incentive tariffs over the term of 20 years in deciding

to invest in the PV sector in Italy.’?’

In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants’ interpretation and understanding of
the incentive regime established under the Conto Energia Decrees and, in particular, the
understanding that the specific tariff rates granted to qualifying production facilities would
remain unchanged for the term of 20 years, was objectively reasonable and justified on the

basis of the language of the Conto Energia Decrees, the GSE Letters and the GSE

Agreements. In the absence of any mention in those instruments that the tariffs were subject

to adjustment, the Claimants’ understanding was well founded.”

The Tribunal has considered the Respondent’s arguments that the Conto Energia Decrees
were addressed generally to all investors, both domestic and international, and that there
were no discussions or meetings between the Claimants or their investment companies and
representatives of the Respondent in which any specific assurances or commitments
regarding the incentive tariffs were made. In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, such
meetings or direct discussions were not required. Explicit promises or guarantees can be
given in the legislative and regulatory framework of a state at the time an investor makes
its investment when the purpose of that framework is to guarantee stability to investors

upon which they can rely when deciding to invest.’

The Conto Energia Decrees contain such explicit guarantees, thereby negating the need to
support this conclusion in this regard by reference to statements made by Italian officials.
The Conto Energia Decrees provided in clear terms that PV producers who qualified would
receive specific tariffs for a period of 20 years. Further, once a producer qualified, it was
sent a letter from the GSE, addressed to it specifically, confirming its qualification and the
tariff rate it would receive over a period of 20 years. The plant was then required to enter
into an agreement with the GSE, again confirming the specific tariff rate and the term of

20 years.

The majority of the Tribunal finds that it is also apparent that the Respondent was aware

that foreign investors would invest under the Conto Energia regime. This is apparent, for

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the GSE Agreements under Contos I-IV provided that any modification

to the agreement had to be agreed to by the parties, whereas the GSE Agreements under Conto V provided that the
GSE retained the right to unilaterally modify the clauses of the agreement as a result of any legislative and regulatory
amendments. See Sample GSE Agreements under Conto I: C-063, Art. 10; Conto II: C-073, Art. 10; Conto III: C-332,

conferences. ”°°

533. The Tribunal has also considered the Respondent’s argument that the incentives were
“sratuitous.””>! The majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded that this qualification is apt,
since in order to qualify for the tariffs, producers were required to invest in and construct
PV plants and then to operate those plants to produce electricity pursuant to the terms of
the Conto Energia Decrees and the GSE Agreements. In return, the GSE would pay the

specified tariff rates to qualifying Producers.

534. The Tribunal has also considered the numerous statements made by various government
entities and the GSE regarding the Conto Energia scheme and the nature of the incentive

tariffs. Amongst these, the Tribunal has noted the following:

e GSE Report “Le attivita del Gestore dei Servizi Elettric’” (2007): describing

Conto Energia Il, which states that “[t]he incentive tariff, not subject to

variations for the entire period, is delivered for a period of [20] years.”7>

e GSE Report “Statistical Report 2011 — Renewable Energy Power Plants in
Italy”: “The feed-in premium ([C]onto [E]nergia) is the main support scheme
for solar power generation. The scheme, which has been in place since
1 November 2005, has experienced frequent adjustments due to the changing
PV market context [referring to Contos I, II, III, IV]. The support is granted for
electricity generation as of the date of commissioning of the plant over a period
of [20] years. The tariffs vary by capacity class and level of integration of the

plant and are constant throughout the support period.””>”

In the majority’s view, these promotional statements and reports, amongst others, are all
consistent with, and confirm the content of, the Conto Energia Decrees and the GSE Letters
and GSE Agreements. There was no contemporaneous evidence introduced that there was
any other understanding as to how the Conto Energia regime was to operate that would
undermine either the reasonableness or the legitimacy of the Claimants’ expectations. To
the contrary, all of the evidence supports the conclusion that the Respondent designed a
system based on a constant tariff rate being paid to qualifying investors for the expected

operational life of their investments.

The Claimants also submitted a number of contemporaneous reports from law firms and
industry associations describing the benefits of the Conto Energia program, including an
explanation that the tariffs under the Conto Energia Decrees were held constant or fixed
for 20 years.”** These reflect a broad understanding in the PV sector and amongst industry

advisors consistent with the Claimants’ understanding and expectations.

The Claimants also obtained due diligence reports from DLA Piper for each of their
investments. These reports cover various aspects of the Claimants’ investments. A number
of the reports describe the Conto Energia regulatory network and refer to the fact that tariffs

under the various Conto Energia Decrees are granted for 20 years and remain unchanged

during this period.” None of the due diligence reports indicates that the tariff rates are
subject to modification. As noted above, the Respondent maintains that if the due diligence
had involved an assessment of the risks of the modification of the Conto Energia Decrees,
conducted by Italian lawyers, they would have disclosed that long-term regulatory schemes
are subject to modification under Italian law. In this regard, it referred to the
2017 Constitutional Court Decision. On that basis, the Respondent suggested that the due

diligence undertaken by the Claimants was inadequate.

The majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. The provision in the Conto
Energia Decrees referring to the tariffs as constant throughout the 20-year incentive period,
repeated in the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements, is clear and does not appear to have
given rise to any concerns by the Claimants’ advisors. ’*° There was no indication anywhere
in the legislation or ministerial decrees that the tariff rates would be subject to revision. In
light of this, and the many statements and reports by government entities which described
the tariffs as constant or fixed for a 20-year term, referred to above, the majority of the
Tribunal is not persuaded that it was incumbent upon the Claimants to request an
assessment of the possibility or likelihood that the Italian authorities would modify the
Conto Energia Decrees and change the tariffs granted to qualifying plants.”' In reaching
this conclusion, the majority of the Tribunal has borne in mind the Respondent’s reference
to the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision. However, the Decision was published in
January 2017 and, as such, could not have affected the Claimants’ expectations when they
invested in the period of 2009-2012. Further and in any event, having found that the regime
made specific promises intended to guarantee stability to prospective investors, seeking an
assessment as to the likelihood of Italy modifying the tariffs for investments after they had

been made would amount to an assessment of Italy’s likelihood to breach the ECT.

See, e.g., DLA Piper, July 2011 Due Diligence Report: C-293; DLA Piper, “Legal Due Diligence Report on

a Photovoltaic Project developed in Lazio, Italy named Project Ardea in the Municipality of Ardea (Rome),” 17 June
2011: C-326; DLA Piper, “Legal Due Diligence Report of four Photovoltaic Projects developed in Lazio, Italy named

most part at the Italian offices of DLA Piper.

The Tribunal has also considered the investment memorandum prepared by KGAL, which
the Respondent says indicated that the Claimants were aware of the risk that tariff rates in
Italy could be modified.” The memorandum gives an overview of KGAL’s investment
strategy for a proposed European Solar Power Fund which was likely to target Germany,
Spain, Italy and Greece. One of the elements of the proposed strategy was to target
investment in countries with nationally-regulated remuneration programs that guarantee
the operator of PV facilities a fixed purchase price over a fixed period.” In referring to
regulatory risks, the memorandum states, in relevant part that “there is the risk of other,
currently unforeseeable changes in the respective country’s [sic] laws, which could have
adverse effects on the operation of photovoltaic facilities and thus on the results arising
from the investment (see also in this regard the note on the risk [of changes in the] price of
electricity).” Under the note on electricity price, the memorandum stated that it could not
be ruled out that the current legal situation in the individual target countries would change
and that the investment companies might be required to dispose of the electricity they
produced contrary to assumptions such as compensation at statutory rates.’ In his
testimony, Mr. Ebner described the passages in question as general comments on potential
risks in an early investment memorandum that did not relate to a specific investment or a
specific country. He added that such disclaimers are typical for sales brochures and
prospectuses and are intended to cover all possible eventualities, and did not indicate

acceptance of any particular risk.”45

In the majority’s view, in light of the clear language of the Conto Energia Decrees, the
GSE Letters and GSE Agreements, the statements in the investment memorandum do not
reflect a failure in the Claimants’ due diligence or a relevant risk which should have

affected the Claimants’ expectations or decision to invest in Italy.

With respect to the date at which the Claimants’ expectations should be assessed, it is the

date on which the decision to invest was made. The Tribunal accepts that in larger projects

that develop over a period of time, there may be some difficulty in ascertaining the precise
date at which an investment is made.”° Adopting the approach taken in Novenergia v.
Spain, the Claimants say that the Tribunal could assess their expectations at the dates on
which each Claimant acquired its first plant in its portfolio of investments, namely
15 December 2009 for ESPF; 17 June 2011 for ESPF 2; and 20 December 2010 for ICE 5.
Alternatively, they say that the Tribunal can view each plant as a separate investment and
look to the acquisition date for each plant.” In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, it is
not necessary to choose between these alternatives since the regulatory framework did not
change in any material way during the time period in which the Claimants made their
investments. In any event, the Tribunal has assessed the Claimants’ expectations under

both alternatives.

Regarding any relevance to be attached to the timing of the Claimants’ acquisition of their
investments, the majority of the Tribunal finds no meaningful distinction in the Claimants’
expectations depending on whether the Claimants invested in plants that had already been
commissioned or in plants that had not yet been commissioned. With respect to the plants
they acquired when already in operation, with a GSE Agreement already in hand, the
Claimants say that their expectations were based on: (i) the specific assurance Italy gave
in the Conto Energia Decree applicable to the given plant; (ii) the specific assurance
written in a letter confirming the precise Conto Energia tariff that would be paid to the
given plant; and (iii) the specific assurance stated in the GSE Agreement. The majority
agrees with the Claimants that their right to the specific tariff under the applicable Conto
Energia Decree vests at the time in which a particular plant enters into operation, and not
when the GSE Agreement is executed, sometimes up to one year after that plant becomes

entitled to a particular tariff rate under the Conto Energia Decree.

With respect to the Claimants’ plants which they acquired during their development phase,
the Claimants say that their expectations were based on the specific assurances given in the

applicable Conto Energia Decree that the plants in which they were investing were legally

entitled to receive the relevant tariffs for 20 years, which would be confirmed in the GSE
Letters and GSE Agreements upon commissioning. With respect to this category, the
Claimants say that they understood that there was a risk that tariff levels could be modified
before a plant was commissioned. However, the Claimants did not expect that the tariff
could be changed after a plant was commissioned, which was confirmed in the GSE Letters
and the GSE Agreements in respect of each relevant plant. Once these plants were
commissioned and the requirements under the Conto Energia Decrees were fulfilled by a
plant, it was in the same position as plants acquired by the Claimants after commissioning.
In each case, the Claimants’ expectation was based on the assurance that tariffs would be
paid at the specified rate throughout the incentive period. As such, the majority of the
Tribunal finds that the legitimate expectations analysis pursuant to the ECT and
international law does not require a “timing test” or temporal aspect, as argued by the

Respondent in reliance on the CEF v. Italy award and Greentech v. Italy dissent.

For the avoidance of doubt, the majority of the Tribunal has specifically considered the
fact that some of the Claimants’ investments were made after the regime began to decrease
the tariffs for new plants and, in particular, after the date of the Romani Decree, a fact that
the Belenergia v. Italy tribunal considered significant.”** As the Tribunal’s review of the
legislative regime details, it was designed to attract early investment in a developing sector
in part by decreasing the applicable tariffs over time. A key feature of the regime was the

grandfathering of qualifying existing investments as it evolved.

From its review of all of the relevant evidence and the Parties’ arguments, the majority of
the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants’ expectations arising from the Conto
Energia regime were legitimate expectations for the purposes of FET under the ECT.
Conto Energia Decrees II, III and IV gave an express assurance or commitment that plants
which qualified under the terms of the regime would receive a specified incentive tariff in
constant terms for the duration of the incentive period. The commitment given in the Conto
decrees was repeated and confirmed in the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements. In addition,

the majority of the Tribunal finds that the circumstances surrounding the Conto Energia

regime and the Claimants’ investment created the reasonable expectation on the part of the
Claimants that if they invested and fulfilled the requirements of the Conto Energia regime,
they would be entitled to payment of the specific tariff rates throughout the term of the 20-

year investment period.

In the Tribunal’s view, the purpose behind the Respondent’s renewable energy incentive
regime, and in particular the Conto Energia regime specific to PV energy, was to attract
investment in order to permit it to comply with the EU’s renewable energy initiatives and
directives. It appears that the tariffs offered by the Respondent were attractive and resulted
in substantial investment, including from the Claimants. The upfront, capital intensive and
long-term nature of investments in the PV sector was well known and appears to have been
borne in mind in the design of the Conto Energia regime, and in particular the granting of
specific tariff rates for a period of 20 years to qualifying PV plants. In all the circumstances,
the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants had the legitimate expectation
that the plants in which they invested would benefit from the specific tariffs provided in

the Conto Energia Decrees, GSE Letters and GSE Agreements over a 20-year period.

(3) Did the Challenged Measures Violate the Claimants’ Legitimate
Expectations?

violated their legitimate expectations that the plants in which they invested would benefit

from the specific tariffs granted under the Conto Energia Decrees over the full 20-year

investment period.

The Claimants say that the reduction of the tariffs under the Spalmaincentivi Decree caused
them significant harm. However, they say that the size or impact of the reduction is
irrelevant to the determination of liability with respect to its claims, since none of the
applicable legal standards requires a showing of any particular degree of harm.’*? The
Claimants emphasize that the specific commitments given by the Respondent under the
Conto Energia Decrees created very specific expectations that their PV plants would
receive precise tariff rates until a specific date. As such, any reduction to the tariff rates
violates the Claimants’ expectations, regardless of the size of the reduction and resulting
harm. In any event, the Claimants maintain that the Spalmaincentivi Decree reduced the

tariffs and harmed their investments significantly.”*°

In addition, the Claimants say that the Spalmaincentivi Decree (and the other Challenged
Measures that indirectly reduced the Conto Energia tariffs) changed the essential
characteristics of the Conto Energia regime. The Claimants say that by reducing the tariff
rates, the Respondent removed the precision that characterized the original regulatory
framework which provided for a specific tariff rate for a definite period of time. It was on
the basis of that specificity and commitment of stability that the Claimants decided to invest
and operate the PV plants they acquired. Further, the Claimants maintain that the
Spalmaincentivi Decree introduced considerable uncertainty into the Conto Energia

regime.”*! The original predictable ex ante regime which guaranteed a defined tariff rate

137:10. The Claimants also maintain that if the degree

of harm were to be taken into account in determining liability, this would penalize prudent investors and those that
took measures to mitigate the harm caused to their investments. In this regard, the Claimants state that their plants
were not highly leveraged compared to many other PV investors. The Claimants say they were leveraged at ratios
ranging from 47-66%, while others were leveraged at levels of 80-90%. If the Claimants’ plants had higher leverage
ratios, then the Challenged Measures would have had a greater impact in percentage terms on the Claimants’ equity.
As will be discussed under quantum, below, the Claimants allege that the reduction in tariffs of between 6-8% by the
Spalmaincentivi Decree caused a loss in the value of the Claimants’ investments of €16 million which, when combined
with the effect of the payment term adjustment (€1.5 million reduction in value), represents a decrease of €17.5
million, translating to approximately 7.5% in the value of their investments.

for 20 years was converted into an ex post and ad hoc adjustable regime.’°? The Claimants
say that the reduction of tariffs under the Spalmaincentivi Decree was unexpected and has
left open the possibility of additional changes.”*? They say that the change in the Conto

Energia regime from a framework that guaranteed fixed tariffs to one that can be modified

in the unfettered discretion of the Respondent imposes fundamentally different risks.’

551. In response to the Respondent’s arguments, the Claimants say that, in a case such as this,
where the Respondent has given specific assurances or commitments there is no room for
a balancing exercise between a claimant’s legitimate expectations and a state’s inherent

regulatory authority to amend its legislation. In this regard, the Claimants refer to a number

752 CPHB, {{f 116-118. The Claimants refer to the reports of their regulatory experts, FTI, which maintained that
the nature of the regulatory regime changed from an ex ante fixed regime to an ex post and ad hoc adjustable regime,
which is a fundamental difference. According to the Claimants’ experts, the regulatory concept and methodology
underlying the new incentive tariffs was not disclosed in any regulatory document and there was no explanation of
how the different new structure of the tariffs was derived. According to FTI, if the change in the tariffs is based on a
particular target level, then the regime has shifted from a fixed tariff model to a regulated return model. Further, under
such a model, additional revisions to the tariffs are possible. See FTI Presentation Regulatory Issues, Slides 10, 16-
19; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 610:24-611:22.
See, FTIR1, 45.48:

We note however that looking at the realised (or ex post) rate of return of investors

is inappropriate when assessing whether the returns offered to investors were

sufficient or excessive. The ex-ante rate of return, that is, the rate of return

estimated before the investment is made, captures the uncertainty and risks

embedded in the investment decision (including, inter alia, plant development

risks and operating risks). Ex post rates of return only show the actual realisation

of the different possible states of the world that could have occurred, and can be

significantly higher or lower than the returns expected by investors when the

investment is made. Any analysis regarding the sufficiency of the support,

therefore, must be carried out based on the rates of return that would have been

expected to be realised at the time the investments were made.

FTI R2, { 3.50-3.51:

On the contrary, the CE schemes regulating the PV plants were designed based

on an “at risk” or “ex ante” model in which the regulated firm receives a tariff for

each kWh of electricity produced and invests at its own risk, accepting the

possibility that its return may be below or above its cost of capital (i.c., its eventual

profitability may be lower or higher than the level of profitability that made its

investors willing to provide the necessary capital to fund the investment). In this

regime there is no mechanism to pass on unforeseen costs to consumers.

 

  

 

The allocation of risks between investors and the public is clearly different in the
two regulatory regimes: the PV plants retain a larger share of the risks than the
utilities.

For explanation of the difference between ex ante and ex post regimes, see FTI R2, 4f] 6.20-6.21.

of awards which they say illustrate the fundamental principle that a state’s right to regulate
is limited when it creates legitimate expectations on the part of investors, particularly when
those expectations were created by specific commitments or assurances designed to
encourage investors to invest.’*° The Claimants say that where arbitral tribunals have
employed a balancing exercise, this was because there was no specific commitment or

assurance given by the Respondent state, or because any assurance was broad or general.”°°

Similarly, the Claimants say that the concepts of “proportionality” and “reasonableness”
are not relevant to an FET analysis such as the one in this case in which the Challenged
Measures violate the Claimants’ legitimate expectations based on a specific commitment.
The Claimants say that the specificity of the Respondent’s commitment leaves no room to
argue that the concepts of proportionality and reasonableness should be factored into the
Tribunal’s analysis of liability. The Claimants submit that the only circumstance in which
proportionality and reasonableness are relevant is with respect to a violation of the ECT’s
impairment clause.”°’ The Claimants also say that the withdrawal of an assurance or
commitment given in good faith as an inducement to investment is, by definition,

unreasonable. ”°*

In any event, the Claimants say that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was neither reasonable nor
proportionate. The Claimants complain that the Respondent did not provide meaningful
notice of the tariff reductions, but add that no amount of notice would have made the
reductions reasonable. They say that the tariff reductions under the Spalmaincentivi Decree
were introduced and implemented abruptly and that, in any event, they had no meaningful
way to avoid the harm caused by the measure since their investments were sunk well before
the adoption of the Decree. Further, the Claimants say that the three options for the

implementation of the tariff reductions did not make the Decree either reasonable or

proportionate since each of the options violated the terms of the original tariff framework
and would have caused the Claimants and their investments harm. Finally, the Claimants
say that the “safeguards” which the Respondent alleges it offered to reduce the effect of
the tariff reductions were not meaningful and a number of these were never

implemented.”*?

In response to the Respondent’s reliance on the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision, the
Claimants argue that this decision and Italian law more generally are not legally relevant.
At most, they may have some relevance as a matter of fact. As a result, the Claimants say
that the Decision has no direct relevance and may not influence the Tribunal’s assessment

and application of the ECT and related principles of international law.”

Insofar as the FET standard and their legitimate expectations are concerned, the Claimants
say that Italian court decisions could, in theory, be one element of the relevant factual
background, but only to the extent that these were rendered and knowable before the
relevant investments were made. In this case, the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision was
not published until January 2017 and is therefore irrelevant to the legitimate expectations
analysis since the Claimants’ investments were made several years earlier, beginning in
2009.7°! The Claimants also argue that the Respondent cannot rely on a domestic court
decision that endorsed conduct under domestic law well after the fact in defense of a claim

under the ECT or international law.”

(ii) The Respondent's Arguments

The Respondent says that the Spalmaincentivi Decree does not abrogate the Conto Energia
tariff scheme. It says that the Decree did not create a new regime, but simply implemented

a “small” / “limited” remodulation of tariffs in the existing regime, which applied

CPHB, § 29. With respect to their claim under the Umbrella Clause, the Claimants note that the Court’s

decision addresses the constitutionality of the Spalmaincentivi Decree and not whether the GSE Agreements created
valid obligations under domestic law. They also note that the GSE Agreement before the Court was under Conto V
which contained a unilateral modification provision in the GSE’s favour — not present in the GSE Agreements under
the other Contos — which required any changes to be made by agreement of the parties in writing.

prospectively (“in the future, never for the past”).”°? The Respondent notes that the PV
plants continue to receive incentive tariffs “with the same regularity, duly on time and for
the expected duration” — namely, for the original 20-year period — and, therefore,
disbursements under the regime remain stable.” Further, the Respondent says that the

remodulation or “fine tuning” implemented in the Spalmaincentivi Decree only applied to

the payment of tariffs going forward and was not retroactive. ”°>

557. The Respondent says that it did not limit its ability to remodulate or fine tune its incentives
under the Conto Energia regime. It says that the legitimate right of states to remodulate
their incentive regimes has been accepted by existing arbitral awards as long as the
modification is not disruptive of the mechanism.” According to the Respondent,
irrespective of whether general or specific assurances are given, FET as embedded in
Article 10(1) of the ECT requires that a fundamental or radical change occur. It says that
no such change occurred to the Conto Energia regime, that incentives are still regularly
paid and the duration has not been affected. Further, it says that although the Claimants
may have suffered a reduction in profits, they remain profitable.’°’ The Respondent also
says that any commitment or guarantee regarding tariff rates does not imply, as a necessary
consequence, that the tariffs should remain immune from changes that are typical of a long

term relationship for a period of 20 years.’°* The Respondent contends that this proposition

contests the Claimants’ use of the concept of “retroactivity” to qualify the effects of the Spalmaincentivi Decree; it
says that the decree does not seek to claw back tariff payments already made. Rather, it only affects tariff payments
as of the date of its implementation. On the other hand, the Claimants refer to the effects of the decree as “retroactive”
in the sense that it affected tariff rates which had already been granted and implemented under the Conto Energia
scheme, on the basis of which they had invested. From the Claimants’ perspective, the decree had a retroactive effect
since it reduced the tariff rates which it expected to rely on to recoup their sunk, upfront capital investment and their
ongoing operating costs.

has been equally recognized in the recent SCC Jsolux award concerning Spanish measures

in the PV sector.”°

558. The Respondent says that the Tribunal should balance any legitimate expectations the
Claimants may have had with its inherent regulatory authority and its need to preserve the
right to amend its legislation over time. The Respondent says that the Claimants should
have relied only on the stability of the Conto Energia mechanism as a whole and that such
stability remains in place since the duration of the incentives has not been reduced and the
reduction of the rates was limited. According to the Respondent, the Claimants’
investments remain highly profitable.”” Relying on the award in Blusun v. Italy and the
award in SunReserve v. Italy, the Respondent says that it was entitled to re-modulate the

tariffs in a manner proportionate with the aim of its legislation.””!

559. The Respondent argues that the proportionality and reasonableness of its measures is
relevant in assessing whether there has been a violation of an obligation under the ECT.
The Respondent asserts that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was reasonable, arguing that the
reduction of tariff incentives in terms of the percentage of the total tariff incentives to be

paid under the terms of the Conto Energia Decrees was extremely low.”

560. The Respondent criticizes the Greentech v. Italy award’s finding that the changes imposed
by the Spalmaincentivi Decree were of an unforeseeable “magnitude.” Italy argues that

the tribunal “could not point to any change to be considered elevated by any reasonable

overall incentive amount forecast to be paid to the Claimants’ plants over the course of the incentive period (€16
million compared to a global amount of €570 million). The Claimants contest the Respondent’s calculation on a
number of bases. They say that the Respondent’s calculation compares apples to oranges because the calculation of
the incentive tariff reduction (€16.6 million, in the Respondent’s calculation) is discounted and after tax, while the
calculation of the total amount of tariffs to be paid absent the Spalmaincentivi Decree is undiscounted and before tax.
Further, the Claimants say that the calculation is not relevant since it does not reflect the impact of the Spalmaincentivi
Decree on the value of the Claimants’ investments which the Parties agree is either €16 million or 16.6 million. The
Tribunal discusses this issue further below.

standards, and in comparison with those applied in Spain [e.g., in Masdar], where indeed
the tribunals consistently differentiated between a first set of measures, considered to be
legitimate and whose adjustments were higher that [sic] those imposed by Italy, and a
second set of measures that were yet considered to violate the ECT but whose changes
were radical.”’”* The Respondent says that the Greentech tribunal fails to explain what
exactly changes “of the magnitude” imposed by Italy means and argues that the award is

poorly reasoned.’”°

Italy counters that the Challenged Measures, such as the Spalmaincentivi Decree, were
proportionate to the goal, since the effect on the Claimants’ rights was limited when
compared to the risk to the sustainability of the incentive system, a crisis in the Italian
economy, and an excessive burden for end-users. Specifically, the Respondent says that it
faced the need to reduce the incentive tariffs because they created an excessive burden on
end-users, primarily small and medium enterprises who paid for the incentives through one
component of their electricity bills.’”° The Respondent also submits that it was important

to reduce the tariffs in order to preserve the sustainability of the incentive system.’””

The Respondent says that it enacted the Spalmaincentivi Decree progressively, only after
offering investors the opportunity to reduce their tariff rates voluntarily pursuant to the
Destinazione Italia Decree, enacted at the end of 2013.7” Further, the Spalmaincentivi
Decree offered PV producers three options on how the tariffs would be restructured.””? The
Respondent argues that this was a reasonable step which permitted producers to choose the
option which best fit their situation.”*° In addition, safeguards were offered to PV producers
to facilitate obtaining bank loans, requiring local authorities to extend authorizations and

permits to align with any extended time period under the decree, and an auction through

which renewable energy producers could assign up to 80% of their incentives to one of

several “major European financial players.””*!

563. The Respondent argues that the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision, and previous
decisions, is relevant both as applicable law and as fact.’*? It accepts that the Tribunal must
determine this dispute on the basis of the ECT and not whether the Spalmaincentivi Decree
(or other Challenged Measures) comply with Italian law. Nevertheless, it says that Italian
law should influence the legal standard the Tribunal applies to determine whether it

violated the ECT and international law.

564. According to the Respondent, the fact that the Constitutional Court found that the
Spalmaincentivi Decree complied with Italian constitutional law is relevant to the questions
this Tribunal must determine.”*? For the Tribunal to understand what legitimate
expectations may have arisen in this case, it must conduct a comparative analysis of
domestic legal systems to understand the limits of such expectations in domestic law. The
Respondent says that the Constitutional Court’s decision reaffirmed a well-established
principle of Italian law that legitimate expectations do not imply for the legislator an

absolute preclusion to modify a long-term relationship, even where the object of the

relationship is a vested right, including rights vested by contract.”**

565. In addition, the Respondent says that the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision is relevant as
a matter of fact since it illustrates the application of the principle that legitimate
expectations at Italian law do not imply for the legislature an absolute preclusion from

modifying a long-term relationship. The Respondent says that this means that “if one

courts and the ECHR. The Respondent also submits that the Constitutional Court’s decision regarding legitimate
expectations coincided with decisions of other national courts, including the Spanish Constitutional Court. The
Respondent argues that the consistent application of this principle by Italian and Spanish Courts “makes the
elaboration of the domestic constitutional courts as common principles to become sources of international law under
Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ:” see RPHB, §§ 35-36.

invests in Italy, it cannot expect that, because of the existence per se of a contract, the

legislator is automatically ban [sic] from modifying its legislation.”7*°

(iii) The Tribunal’s Analysis

566. The majority of the Tribunal has concluded that in the Conto Energia Decrees (in particular
Contos II, II and IV at issue here), the Respondent gave a specific assurance and
commitment that the tariffs for which PV plants qualified would remain constant or
unchanged for 20 years. These specific assurances were later repeated in the GSE Letters
and GSE Agreements. The majority of the Tribunal has also concluded that the specific
assurances contained in the Conto Energia Decrees gave rise to a legitimate expectation
by the Claimants to the same effect and that the later confirmation of these assurances in
the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements is evidence of the legitimacy of the Claimants’
expectation that the tariff rates for which each investment qualified would remain
unchanged for a twenty-year period. For the reasons described below, the majority of the
Tribunal finds that by unilaterally decreasing pursuant to the Spalmaincentivi Decree the
tariffs for which the Claimants’ PV plants qualified, the Respondent violated the

Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

567. While the Respondent says that the legislative framework did not contain a stabilization
clause or promise to freeze the terms of the Conto Energia Decrees, the majority of the
Tribunal finds that the specific and repeated language of the Conto Energia Decrees, which
was confirmed in the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements, constituted a specific commitment
that the tariffs granted would be paid and remain constant for the full 20-year incentive
term. The purpose of the legislative scheme was to encourage investment in the

Respondent’s PV sector by, inter alia, setting out a predictable revenue stream in the form

785 RPHB, {37. The Respondent also submits that the GSE Agreements were not “mere private law contract[s]”

but accessory contracts, which reduces further the scope of protection as a consequence of legitimate expectations. As
a result, ding to the d iti i that Italian lation on subsidies to the PV sector
could not be remodulated could not have arisen. Finally, with respect to the Claimants’ umbrella clause claim, the
Respondent says that since the Constitutional Court declared the legitimacy of the decree under Italian law, as a matter
of fact, no infringement of the umbrella clause can exist as a matter of law: see RPHB, {fj 37-38.

of FITs, which coincided with the expected life of a PV plant, upon which possible

investors could assess whether to invest.

The Tribunal notes that neither the legislative decrees nor the Conto Energia Decrees gave
any indication that the tariffs could or would be modified to take into account factors such
as the rate of return to investors, profit margin or the decreasing cost of PV technology,
upon which the Respondent now relies, or otherwise. Rather, the Conto Energia Decrees
provided very specific tariff rates which were stated to remain constant throughout the 20-
year term. In fact, the Conto Energia Decrees specifically addressed the question of
decreasing technology costs by providing lower tariffs for plants entering into production
after specified future dates. The later Conto Energia Decrees also provided for a cap on the
overall annual cost of the incentive regime. These provisions were duly implemented and
once the incentive regime reached its cap, no further incentive tariffs were available for
new PV plants. However, under the terms of the Conto Energia Decrees, the GSE Letters
and the GSE Agreements, the tariffs granted to PV plants when they qualified under the
terms of the Conto Energia Decrees were specifically stated to remain constant throughout

the 20-year incentive term.

In addition, the Claimants submit that the Spalmaincentivi Decree amended the payment
modalities of the incentive tariffs, causing them further harm. Payment was changed from
payment of tariffs on a monthly basis based on the PV plant’s actual production to payment
of tariffs in monthly instalments amounting to 90% of the plant’s estimated yearly average
production of electricity. The payment of the balance based on actual production would be
delayed for 6-18 months, which affected cash flow.”*° The Tribunal has reviewed the
language of the payment terms contained in the Conto Energia Decrees, the GSE Letters
and the GSE Agreements and the majority finds that, unlike the language relating to the
incentive tariff rates, the language relating to the payment terms was not specific enough
to form the basis of a legitimate expectation that the payment modality for the incentive

tariffs would not change over the period of the investment.

On the other hand, in the majority of the Tribunal’s view, the repeated express language of
the Conto Energia Decrees, confirmed in each case by the corresponding GSE Letters and
GSE Agreements, which identified the specific Investments that had qualified for the
tariffs, that the tariffs would remain constant throughout the incentive term amounted to a
specific commitment that the tariffs would remain fixed for the entire term. This specific
commitment limited and restricted the Respondent’s right to reduce the tariffs for which
investors had qualified. It follows that by reducing the tariffs, the Respondent did not

honour its commitment and violated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

The Respondent argues that it did not radically change its incentive regime and only
“remodulated” or “fine-tuned” the regime by reducing the tariffs by a modest amount,
which did not affect the stability of the overall Conto Energia regime. The Respondent also
argues that in determining whether there had been a breach of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, the Tribunal should balance the Claimants’ expectations with its right to
regulate and amend its legislation over time. In addition, the Respondent says that the
Spalmaincentivi Decree was a reasonable and proportionate measure. In the majority of the

Tribunal’s view, none of these arguments are pertinent.

The Respondent relies on the award in Blusun v. Italy in support of its position that the
Claimants did not have any legitimate expectation that the tariffs under the Conto Energia
Decrees would remain unchanged for 20 years.’®” In that case, one of the measures which
was alleged to have caused the failure of a project to construct a large PV plant and obtain
tariffs under Conto III was the Romani Decree, which shortened the period to qualify for
tariffs under that Conto.’** In its award, the tribunal quoted from the award in Charanne v.
Spain, which distinguished between a regulatory standard and a specific commitment of a
state, as follows:

[U]nder international law ... in the absence of a specific commitment toward
stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory

framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at any time
to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.”*?

The Blusun v. Italy tribunal went on to conclude that “the Romani Decree and [Conto IV],
taken overall, were not disproportionate, did not violate specific commitments made to the
promoters of PV plants, and did not breach Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT.”’”°
The tribunal also found that Italy had made no special commitments to the claimants in
that case with respect to the extension and operation of tariffs nor did it specifically

undertake that relevant Italian laws would remain unchanged.””!

The Claimants distinguish the decision in Blusun v. Italy and say it is irrelevant to the
claims in this case, which are very different. They say that Blusun v. Italy did not involve
the Spalmaincentivi Decree nor did it involve the reduction of incentive tariffs that had
already been granted to existing PV plants. Rather, the Romani Decree changed the
modalities of Conto III for plants that had not yet been constructed and properly qualified
under Conto III. As such, this aspect of the Blusun vy. Italy case concerned the loss of an
opportunity to obtain Conto Energia tariffs, which is different from the Claimants’ claim
in this case where all of their investments had qualified for and received tariffs for several

years before the Spalmaincentivi Decree was adopted.”

The Claimants say that the B/usun tribunal’s finding that Italy was within its rights to
modify the Conto Energia regime in ways that would affect new (not yet completed or
connected) plants is consistent with their view in this case. The Claimants say they were
aware that the Respondent could change the incentives framework for plants that were not
yet enrolled and in a Conto Energia program. However, the Claimants say that they

benefited from the specific commitment in the Conto Energia Decrees, confirmed in the

Blusun y. Italy: CL-139, 317, quoting Charanne y. Spain: CL-004, 4 510.
Blusun y. Italy: CL-139, 4 343.

Claimants’ Reply, §{] 413-418. The Claimants note that the tribunal in the Blusun case concluded that

Blusun’s failure to construct the plants or to connect them to the grid was due to its own decisions, notably the failure

individual GSE Letters and GSE Agreements, that their PV plants would receive payment

of a specific tariff at constant rates for 20 years.”°>

In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, the circumstances and claims addressed in the
Blusun v. Italy case are different from those in this case. The tribunal in the Blusun v. Italy
case was not required to address the effect of the Spalmaincentivi Decree on investors who
had qualified for and been granted tariffs under the Conto Energia Decrees. Further, both
the Blusun and Charanne tribunals recognized that specific commitments given by a state
can give rise to legitimate expectations and neither tribunal addressed the specific

provisions of the Conto Energia Decrees at issue in the present case.

Turning to the question of the size of the effect of the Spalmaincentivi Decree, in light of
the very specific commitment and the legitimate expectations it created, the majority of the
Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that this consideration is irrelevant. In the majority’s
view, any reduction of the specific commitment to pay the specific tariff rates on a constant
basis throughout the 20-year term is a violation of the Respondent’s commitment and the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations. While in cases where there is not a specific
commitment or assurance from a state, or only a broad, general assurance, the nature and
degree of change to a regulatory regime may be relevant, this is not the case where such a
specific commitment has been given and where the Claimants have satisfied the clearly

laid out requirements to qualify for the incentive tariff rates under each of Contos II-IV.

In any event, the majority of the Tribunal has concluded that the effect of the
Spalmaincentivi Decree on the Claimants’ investments was significant. It was common
ground between the Parties that the effect of the Spalmaincentivi Decree was to reduce the
tariffs applicable to the Claimants’ various plants by 6-8%. This reduction caused a loss in
the value of the Claimants’ investments of approximately €16 million or 7.5%.’4 In the

majority’s view, this is a sizable impact and cannot be qualified as a de minimus effect.

Claimants’ Reply, 417-418.
As will be discussed below, the Tribunal accepts the methodology adopted by the Claimants’ and their

quantum experts in calculation damages. Accepting that methodology, the Parties’ estimates of the loss in value to the
Claimants is between €16 million and €16.6 million.

In addition, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the reduction of the tariff rates affected
an essential element of the Conto Energia framework. As described above, the regime
provided an ex ante framework with a fixed tariff rate for a period of 20 years. This
provided a predictable basis on which the Claimants decided to invest and operate the
plants they acquired. The reduction in the tariffs affected the specific tariff rates on which
the Claimants based their decision to invest and introduced uncertainty with respect to tariff
rates going forward.”*> As explained by the Claimants’ regulatory experts, the reduction of
the tariffs on the basis of a “fair remuneration” or “fair return” changed the regime from
an ex ante fixed regime to an ex post and ad hoc adjustable regime.”° As a result, the
majority of the Tribunal finds that the adoption of the Spalmaincentivi Decree changed the
nature of the Conto Energia regime and introduced significant uncertainty going forward.
As a result, the majority of the Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondent’s argument that

the Spalmaincentivi Decree was simply a “fine tuning” of the Conto Energia regime.

The Tribunal has considered the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants should have
relied only on the stability of the Conto Energia mechanism as a whole and that such
stability remains since the duration of the incentives has not been reduced and the reduction
was minimal. The Respondent also argued that the Claimants’ investments remain
profitable. In the Tribunal’s view, these arguments miss the point. The Conto Energia
regime included a commitment that specific tariff rates would be paid to qualifying
investors on a constant basis for 20 years. In these circumstances, in the majority’s view,
the fact that the Conto Energia regime as a whole remains in place or the fact that the
Claimants’ investments may currently be profitable is not relevant to the question of
whether the Claimants’ legitimate expectations with respect to tariff rates has been

violated.

Mr. Miraglia, an energy analyst in the Energy Studies, Statistics and Sustainability unit of the GSE, testified

that if conditions arose which affected the fair remuneration of fair investment costs and remuneration of costs of PV
plants, then the Respondent would have the right to further reduce the incentive tariffs. In this regard, Mr. Miraglia
referred to decreased in operating costs: see Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 568:16-569:4.

796

FTI R2, 4 2.4-2.32; FTI Regulatory Issues Presentation, Slide 10; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 610:24-

611:13. FTI noted that there was no indication or evidence of how the reductions in the Spalmaincentivi Decree were
determined or what regulated return level was targeted. In their opinion, the change from an ex ante to an ex post and
ad hoc adjustable regime was a significant change from a regulatory perspective.

The majority of the Tribunal reaches a similar conclusion with respect to the Respondent’s
argument that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was a proportionate and reasonable measure and
therefore did not violate the Claimants’ legitimate expectations or obligation under the
ECT. In the majority’s view, where an investor’s expectations are found to be legitimate
and the Respondent’s measures violate that expectation, the concepts of reasonableness

and proportionality are not relevant.

In considering legitimate expectations and the limits these may impose on a state’s ability
to limit a state’s regulatory authority, arbitral tribunals have distinguished between
situations in which a specific commitment has been given to an investor and those where
no commitment or only a general regulatory framework exists.””” As described above, the
majority of the Tribunal has found that the Respondent did provide a specific commitment
in the Conto Energia regime which gave rise to the legitimate expectation of the Claimants
that the tariffs for which they qualified would remain constant for 20 years. Further, the
reduction in the tariffs was significant and affected an essential element of the incentive
tariff regime upon which the Claimants relied. In these circumstances, the Respondent’s
arguments with respect to proportionality and reasonableness are not relevant to the

determination that the Claimants’ legitimate expectations were violated.

In any event, the Tribunal has considered the Respondent’s arguments regarding the

proportionality and reasonableness of the Spalmaincentivi Decree.

The Respondent argued that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was proportionate in that the effect
on the Claimants’ rights was limited as compared to the excessive burden the incentive
regime created for end-users and the risk of the sustainability of the incentives system.’
Having carefully reviewed all of the available evidence, the majority of the Tribunal is not

persuaded by these arguments. With respect to the alleged burden on electricity consumers,

See, e.g., El Paso v. Argentina: CL-055, §f 374-375, 377; Total v. Argentina: CL-051, §§ 117-119; Blusun v.

Italy: CL-139, § 319(4) (the FET “standard preserves the regulatory authority of the host state to make and change its
laws and regulations to adapt to changing needs, including fiscal needs, subject to respect for specific commitments
made”); Oostergetel v. Slovakia: CL-207, § 223; Parkerings v. Lithuania: CL-062, § 331; Micula v. Romania: CL-

the Tribunal notes that the Decree was intended to reduce electricity rates for small and
medium sized enterprises and not residential customers and households. It appears that the
reduction to the A3 component to the end-users in those categories resulted in a decrease
of only 2.6-2.7% of their electricity bills.”° From the report of the Claimants’ regulatory
experts, FTI, it appears unlikely that this decrease in the electricity prices to low and
medium voltage consumers in the small and medium enterprises category would stimulate
demand for industrial electricity to any measurable extent or that, conversely, increases in
electricity prices in the absence of the Spalmaincentivi Decree would have caused any
meaningful reduction in demand for electricity from the users in question.*°° Given the
modest effect of the Spalmaincentivi Decree on electricity prices and consumption, the
majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded that the incentive system was at risk absent the

adoption of the Decree.*”!

This is not to say that the A3 component of electricity bills, which included PV incentives,
did not increase substantially as a proportion of the overall A3 cost component due to the
significant take up under the Conto Energia Decrees. Further, the motivation behind the
adoption of the Spalmaincentivi Decree may well have been to respond to a perceived fiscal
need with a different distribution of tariff charges. In this regard, the Tribunal has taken
note of the Respondent’s reliance on an extract from the Blusun v. Italy award which reads
as follows:

The reduction in FITs was quite substantial, but was not in itself crippling or

disabling. Moreover, it was a response to a genuine fiscal need, given the large

take-up under the earlier Energy Accounts ... The reduction in incentives was

proportionately less than the reduction in the cost of photovoltaic technology

during 2010, and left Italian subsidy levels higher than those in Germany, France
and Spain.8°?

FTI R2, 49 2.35, 7.1, 7.39.
FTI R2, § 7.37. The Claimants’ experts conclude as follows: “The [Spalmaoncentivi] Legislation did not

provide any significant alleviation of any burden imposed on industrial consumers by electricity prices, nor did it lead
to any meaningful increase in either electricity demand or industry competitiveness. The CE support schemes
therefore, would not have been at risk of default absent the [Spalmaincentivi] Legislation: see FTI R2, § 7.39.

801

The Tribunal also notes that pursuant to the Conto Energia regime, once tariffs reached the target of €6.7

billion in 2013, no additional incentivised tariffs were granted. See Claimants’ Reply, §] 305 and the sources cited

therein.

However, as discussed above, the B/usun award addressed a different situation and
different claims than this case. The Blusun claimants had not fulfilled the requirements of
the Conto Energia regime by completing construction of their plants and connecting them
to the grid; their claim was in the nature of a loss of opportunity. The Claimants do not
contest Italy’s ability to change its tariffs on a going-forward basis where an investor has
not fulfilled the conditions of the Conto Energia regime and been granted the tariffs
provided for. Their claim is that once an investor fulfilled the requirements of the Conto
Energia regime, the Respondent’s commitment to pay the specified tariff rates for a period
of 20 years became effective and the reduction of the tariffs thereafter violated their

legitimate expectation on which they had based their investment.

The Respondent also argued that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was reasonable and
proportionate because three different options for implementing the tariff reductions were
given to investors. Further, it says that investors had been given advance notice in the
December 2013 Destinazione Italia Decree of the tariff reductions which would follow in
the June 2014 Spalmaincentivi Decree. For instance, the Respondent says that the
Destinazione Italia Decree contained a number of measures to reduce the high costs of
electricity, and thus was predictable and not an abrupt change, since it should have alerted
the Claimants that measures would have to be taken to reduce the cost of electricity to end-

users. °°

The Claimants say that the Destinazione Italia Decree did not give them, or other PV
investors, any kind of notice of the unilateral, mandatory reduction in tariffs implemented
in the Spalmaincentivi Decree.*°* According to the Claimants, the Destinazione Italia
Decree only offered certain investors the opportunity to reduce their tariffs voluntarily.
Further, the Destinazione Italia Decree did not apply to PV producers since the Conto
Energia tariffs did not fall within any of the categories covered by the Decree. The
Claimants say that the offer in the Destinazione Italia Decree to permit those producers it

covered to choose between the continuation of their existing incentives, and reduction of

those incentives coupled with an extension of the incentive term for seven additional years,
did nothing to alert them to measures which were to be adopted in the Spalmaincentivi

Decree.

Regarding the choice of reductions, the Claimants say that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was
enacted in late June 2014 and required investors to choose one of the three options offered
in that Decree by the end of November 2014, and note that the full details of the options in
question were not announced until late October 2014. In the circumstances, the Claimants
say that the implementation of the Spalmaincentivi Decree was unexpected and abrupt. In
any event, the Claimants say that whatever notice the Respondent had provided would have
been of no effect since all of their investments had already been made and there was no

way to avoid the impact of the Spalmaincentivi Decree.

In the majority’s view, the adoption of the Destinazione Italia Decree cannot reasonably
be said to have given the Claimants or other PV investors notice of the implementation of
the modification of the Conto Energia tariffs. As noted by the Claimants, the Destinazione
Italia Decree did not apply to PV producers and the reduction of tariffs proposed was
voluntary.*°> Further, the Destinazione Italia Decree was adopted well after the Claimants

made their last investment. *°°

Regarding the three options given to investors as to how to implement the reduction in
tariffs, the Respondent says that by offering these alternatives it permitted the plant
operator to select the best alternative according to their business choices.*°’ The
Respondent also says that it put in place certain safeguard measures intended to assist

producers in implementing the tariff reductions.°°*

The Claimants say that Article 26 of the Spalmaincentivi Decree only gave producers three
options of how to calculate the new, reduced tariffs that would apply to them. They say
this was no real choice since each of the three options significantly reduced the value of
the incentives provided for in the Conto Energia Decrees under which they had qualified.
The Claimants also note that if the producer did not choose one of the three options, then

the default option of a 6-8 % reduction in tariffs would apply.°

Each of the three options under the Spalmaincentivi Decree involved a decrease in the
specific tariffs provided for under the Conto Energia Decrees. Although two of the options
(options A and B) offered either an extension of the incentive period or an increase in the
tariff rate in later years to off-set partially the initial reduction in tariffs (which was
significantly greater than under the default option C in early years), the Claimants say that
did not make the measure neutral for investors.*!° It appears that under each of the three
options, the Claimants would have suffered a loss of enterprise or net present value.
Although the Respondent argued that Claimants could have chosen option B (to accept a
larger decrease than option C in early years and then increased by a factor to be determined
by the MED in later years),*"! the majority of the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ argument
that the increase in tariffs in later years created additional regulatory risk which would have
affected a number of the Claimants’ financing obligations. The Tribunal notes that a
majority of 62% of the Producers affected by the Spalmaincentivi Decree chose option C
which involved a reduction of tariffs from between 6-8% for the balance of the incentive
period.*!? In the circumstances, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants’

decision to default to option C was reasonable.

As a result, the majority of the Tribunal finds that even if the factors of reasonableness and
proportionality were relevant, the terms of the Spalmaincentivi Decree were not reasonable

nor proportionate.

The Respondent says that it put in place certain safeguard measures intended to assist
producers in implementing the tariff reductions by helping Producers obtain bank loans,
requiring local authorities to extend authorizations and permits to align with any extended
time period under the Spalmaincentivi Decree, and an auction through which renewable
energy producers could assign up to 80% of their incentives to one of several “major
European financial players.”*!? It says that any delay in the implementation of the bank
loan program provided for in the Spalmaincentivi Decree was due to the market and not
the Ministry of Finance which had adopted a decree recognizing a state guarantee under
the loan program.*!* The majority of the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ argument that the
“safeguards” which the Respondent alleges it offered to reduce the effect of the tariff

reductions were not meaningful and a number of these were never implemented.*!*

Finally, the Respondent relies on the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision, which it says has
conclusively decided that the Spalmaincentivi Decree complied with Italian constitutional
law. As noted previously, the Respondent says that Italian law should influence the
standards which the Tribunal applies to determine whether Italy violated the ECT and
international law and that the Decision is relevant in this regard. It says that the Court
affirmed the principle that, in Italian law, “legitimate expectations do not imply for the
legislator an absolute preclusion to modify, even in a detrimental way, a long-term
relationship, and that this is so even when the object of a long term relationship is a
consolidated subjective right, a vested right, including of course those vested rights that
typically derive from contracts.”*!© The Respondent says that the Decision is consistent
with the principle elaborated by other European courts and refers to EU and ECHR

caselaw. With respect to the questions of reasonableness and proportionality, the

Respondent points to the Court’s reasoning at paragraph 8.2 of its judgment, where it
describes the objective of the decree to achieve a fair balancing of the opposing interests
at play, promoting at the same time a policy of support to the production of energy from

renewable sources, and a more sustainable burden for final users of electric energy.*!”

As noted above, the Claimants say that Italian law, including Italian court decisions, is not
part of the applicable law in this case. Since the Tribunal is required to decide the issues in
accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law, the
2017 Constitutional Court Decision has no direct relevance. In addition, the Claimants say
that both the VCLT and the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States confirm that a party
may not invoke a provision of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a
treaty.*'® The Claimants also say that the Decision is irrelevant since it was rendered a
number of years after the Claimants made their investments and could not have affected

their expectations at that time.

As noted previously, the Tribunal’s decision must be rendered in accordance with the
provisions of the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law. On that
basis, the majority of the Tribunal has found that the Conto Energia regime contained a
specific commitment with respect to the incentive tariffs and a legitimate expectation in
the Claimants that the tariffs for which they qualified would remain constant for the full
incentive term of 20 years. Further, the decision came some years after the Claimants made
their investments and could not have informed their expectations at the relevant time. As
noted above, the Claimants’ expectations were confirmed by the statements made by Italian
authorities and the GSE, and were consistent with the understanding in the PV sector, as

demonstrated by publications by various industry advisors.

b. Administration Fee: Did the Claimants have the legitimate expectation that
no Administration Fee would be imposed and, if so, did the Respondent
violate this legitimate expectation?

The Parties’ respective positions regarding the Administration Fee are summarized above
at paragraphs 152 to 157. The Tribunal addresses here the Claimants’ allegations regarding

how the Administration Fee breached their legitimate expectations.*!?

(i) The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants allege that the imposition of the Administration Fee breached their
legitimate expectations regarding the stability of the tariffs for the full incentive period
under the relevant Conto Energia Decrees.*”° The Claimants say that the Administration
Fee reduced the incentive tariffs indirectly, but that this is not conceptually different from
the direct reduction of the incentive tariffs by the Spalmaincentivi Decree. According to
the Claimants, the Respondent must have contemplated that the GSE would incur costs in
managing the system and that these would be paid out of the difference between the charges
to consumers and the tariffs they had agreed to pay to PV producers. The Claimants suggest
that passing the costs onto PV producers after the fact is simply an indirect way for Italy to
reduce the tariffs.**! Since the Claimants’ expectations were based on explicit promises of
the stability of the tariff rates, the Claimants say that the Respondent had no flexibility to
alter the terms of the incentive framework. Consequently, imposing the Administration Fee
altered the promise of fixed tariffs for 20 years and undermined the Claimants’

expectations.

The Claimants accept that neither the Conto Energia Decrees nor the GSE Agreements
expressly stated that Administration Fees would not be charged. However, for the

Claimants, the absence of a specific prohibition on the imposition of additional fees does

The Claimants also allege that the imposition of the Administration Fees constitute inconsistent treatment

and reflect a lack of good faith under the other elements of the FET standard. They further allege that these fees
breached the ECT’s Impairment Clause and the Umbrella Clause. These claims are addressed below.

Claimants’ Reply, $f] 502-504. The Claimants also allege that the imposition of the Administration Fees and

Imbalance Costs also violated their legitimate expectations regarding the stability of the general economic framework.

821

The Claimants liken this situation to where a buyer agrees to purchase goods at a fixed price and the seller

subsequently adds a “warehouse charge” to the buyer’s invoice to cover the cost of the seller’s own operations. See

not mean that the Respondent was free to impose those charges at will. The Claimants
maintain that the additional charges were completely foreseeable costs of the renewable
energy support scheme and that the Respondent could have chosen to proportion those
costs to producers in the Conto Energia Decrees. Had Italy done so, the Claimants say that
they could have evaluated the economic value of the promised tariffs in light of the
Administration Fee and the risk of additional future charges. The Claimants say that
guaranteeing the tariffs in the Conto Energia Decrees and then arguing that the costs were

implicitly authorized all along, violates any reasonable notion of transparency.*”?

(ii) The Respondent's Arguments

The Respondent says that it made no representations regarding additional charges such as
the Administration Fee. It says that the exemption of PV energy producers from the
payment of such charges was unrelated to the incentive tariff scheme and was never
considered as a means to support the increase of production of renewable energy.*” The
Respondent says that the fact that it established a support scheme for the production of PV
energy cannot affect its ability to adopt measures of a general scope regarding other aspects

of the production of PV energy.

The Respondent asserts that the first four Conto Energia Decrees were silent on the issue
of GSE costs and other charges. The Respondent says that such silence cannot create in an
investor a legitimate expectation that such an existing regulatory situation will be
maintained, for to do so would transform the FET clause into a general freezing clause
limiting its regulatory activity.*** The Respondent also complains that the Claimants’
argument that the imposition of the Administration Fee violates their expectation that the

“general economic framework” of the incentive regime for 20 years effectively attempts to

Claimants’ Reply, § 504. The Claimants also argue that imposing the costs on the Claimants’ PV plants

amounts to inconsistent treatment since the charges had not been imposed in previous years (from 2010 to 2012). For
similar reasons, the Claimants argue that the imposition of the charges amount to a lack of good faith since their
investments were sunk at the time they were made and the Claimants cannot take measures to mitigate the harm caused
by the additional charged: see Claimants’ Reply, {| 505. In addition, the Claimants also argue that the additional charges
violated the ECT’s Impairment Clause and the Umbrella Clause: see Claimants’ Reply, {¥] 506-507.

freeze Italy’s ability to adopt any regulatory measures that could negatively affect the
interests of investors participating in the incentive tariff regimes. The Respondent says that
the Claimants had no legitimate expectation that the general economic framework

applicable to its investments would remain unchanged for 20 years.*?>

The Respondent’s submissions attempt to explain the history of the implementation of
Administration Fee and noted that Conto V extended the GSE’s functions to include
monitoring of the incentive schemes, and that this additional function increased the GSE’s
management costs. The Respondent says that the Administration Fee was carefully
weighted and transparently allocated; it further notes that the Administration Fee was an

extremely low fixed charge.*”°

The Respondent also disputes the Claimants’ contention that the application of the
Administration Fee was retroactive since it only applied prospectively as of 1 January

2013.87

c. Imbalance Costs: Did the Claimants have a legitimate expectation that no
Imbalance Costs would be imposed and, if so, did the Respondent violate
this legitimate expectation?

The Parties’ respective positions regarding the Imbalance Costs are summarized above at
paragraphs 167 to 172. The Tribunal addresses here the Claimants’ allegations regarding

how the Imbalance Costs breached their legitimate expectations. °°

(i) The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants’ position in respect of the Imbalance Costs is very similar to the position
they advance in respect of the Administration Fee. The Claimants say that the imposition

of the Imbalance Costs reduced the incentive tariffs indirectly, but that this is not

Respondent’s Rejoinder, §§] 519-520.
The Respondent says that the contribution from PV producers receiving incentives amounted, on average, to

only 0.16% of the incentive received. The Respondent also says that it is appropriate that the producers benefiting
from the incentives should bear this cost: Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, fj 408-410.

827

828,

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, §] 412.
The Claimants also allege that the imposition of the Imbalance Costs constitute inconsistent treatment and

reflect a lack of good faith under the other elements of the FET standard. They further allege that these fees breached
the ECT’s Impairment Clause and the Umbrella Clause. These claims are addressed below.

conceptually different from the direct reduction of the incentive tariffs by the

Spalmaincentivi Decree.

The Claimants say that Imbalance Costs are a known cost of any electricity system. They
maintain that the decision whether to charge Imbalance Costs to renewable energy
producers is inseparable from the level of tariff support because if the Producers bear the
risk of having to pay Imbalance Costs, they will require additional compensation to off-set
that risk. Since the Conto Energia Decrees did not charge Imbalance Costs to PV
Producers, the Claimants say that the Respondent’s decision after the fact to shift those
costs to Producers was a way to indirectly reduce the tariffs promised in the Conto Energia

regime.*?°

For the same reasons as with respect to the Administration Fee, the Claimants say that the
imposition of the Imbalance Costs breached their legitimate expectation that they would
benefit from the specific tariffs guaranteed under the Conto Energia Decrees, GSE Letters
and GSE Agreements throughout the 20-year incentive period.**° The Claimants accept
that neither the Conto Energia Decrees nor the GSE Agreements expressly stated that
Imbalance Costs would not be charged. However, the Claimants argue that Italy violated
their legitimate expectations by imposing such costs at will. Since Imbalance Costs were
known and foreseeable additional costs on the renewable energy support scheme, the
Claimants say that Italy could have proportioned those costs to Producers in the Conto
Energia Decrees so that the Claimants could have evaluated the economic value of the
promised tariffs in the light of the additional charges and the risk of additional future

charges.

The Respondent explains that at the end of 2012, the Imbalance Costs for non-
programmable production units such as the Claimants’ PV plants was set as equal to the
hourly zonal price and the full residual share was allocated to the end consumer. However,
with the significant development of non-programmable renewable energy sources, the
difficulty in forecasting the quantities of energy that they injected into the grid led to a
continuing increase in costs allocated to energy users in general. The Respondent says that
the injection of non-programmable energy sources generated instability in the system and
created other costs. For this reason, AEEG established the partial, gradual application of
the Imbalance Costs regulations applicable to other producers to non-programmable

renewable energy sources, including the Claimants’ PV plants.

According to the Respondent, the decision of the Consiglio di Stato of 9 June 2014 did not
find that Imbalance Costs could not properly be imposed on PV energy sources. Rather,
the Court found that the method used to calculate the charge for non-programmable energy
sources was inappropriate. According to the Respondent, the Court found that non-
programmable energy sources must be charged imbalance costs in order to avoid
discrimination to the detriment of the other producers.**! The Respondent says that the
AEEG implemented the directions of the Court when it adopted the resolution applying

Imbalance Costs to non-programmable renewable energy producers.

The Respondent argues that, as in the case of the Administration Fee, the Imbalance Costs
have no relationship with the Claimants’ alleged expectation that incentive tariffs would
remain constant for the period of 20 years. For the Respondent, the Imbalance Costs arise
from the supply of electricity into the grid, and are unrelated to incentive tariffs which are
pre-determined amounts granted in addition to the revenues obtained by the sale of
electricity at market prices.*** According to the Respondent, its national authorities have
the discretionary power to decide how the costs of the supply of electricity into the national

grid should be allocated. Since Italy never gave any assurance that PV producers would

not be required to pay Imbalance Costs at any future time, the Claimants cannot invoke

any reasonable expectation that any such costs would not be allocated to them.**?

The Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ argument that the Imbalance Costs violate their
expectation that the “general economic framework” of the incentive regime will remain
stable for 20 years effectively freezes Italy’s ability to adopt any regulatory measure which
is capable of negatively affecting the interests of investors participating in the incentive
tariff regimes. The Respondent says that the Claimants had no legitimate expectation that
the general economic framework applicable to its investments would remain unchanged

for 20 years.*4

(iii) The Tribunal’s Analysis on Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

In the majority’s view, the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs are qualitatively
different from the measures relating to tariffs and do not directly affect the tariff rates. The
Conto Energia regime made no reference to either charge, nor did it make any commitment
that such fees would not be applied. There was no specific promise made by the Respondent
with respect to the future allocation of any Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs in the

Conto Energia regime or elsewhere.

The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants’ arguments that the possibility of
administration fees and/or imbalance costs was foreseeable at the time the Conto Energia
regime was designed and that, in the absence of any specific reference to these fees in the
regime, the Claimants could legitimately expect that these would not be imposed since they
would affect the tariff rates. To the extent that the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs
were foreseeable, the Claimants should also have been aware of these potential costs. In
the absence of a specific reference in the Conto Energia regime, it was not a legitimate
expectation that there was no risk of potential future costs being allocated to or imposed

on producers.

From the evidence, it appears that both the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs are
related to additional fees or costs of administering the Conto Energia regime. In the
absence of a specific promise regarding these charges (or even any others like them), there
could have been no legitimate expectation that these charges would not be imposed on
producers. In addition, the majority of the Tribunal notes that the Administration Fee and
Imbalance Costs are also quantitatively different from the tariff decreases; the amounts in
question are not substantial and, in the circumstances, do not appear disproportionate or
unreasonable. There was no indication that these fees and costs were imposed in order to

reduce tariffs paid to producers.

d. MGP/ Off-Take Regime

As in the case of the Spalmaincentivi Decree, the Claimants allege that the reduction of the
MGP under the Off-Take Regime violated various provisions of Article 10(1) of the ECT.
The Tribunal addresses here the Claimants’ claim that the reduction of the MGP breached

their legitimate expectations.**>

(i) The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants allege that the Respondent’s commitment to promote PV facilities and its
clear goals of ensuring the competitiveness and economic survival of smaller PV plants, as
implemented in the Off-Take Regime, created a legitimate expectation that the MGP, once
granted, would remain available to the Claimants’ investments and above a certain
competitive threshold for a prolonged period of time. They note that the MGP established
by the AEEG over a period of six years ranged between €72 and €106 per MWh of
electricity produced, and that this course of dealing reinforced the legitimate expectation
that the MGP would be paid at rates within that range. The Claimants also note that the

AEEG Resolution setting out the basis for the MGPs provided that these would be revised

In addition to the breach of their legitimate expectations, the Claimants allege that the measures breached the

 

to treat their i and i . They also argue that the Challenged Measures

were unreasonable. In addition, the Claimants maintain that the Challenged Measures were arbitrary and in breach of
the Impairment Clause in Art. 10(1) of the ECT. Finally, the Claimants also allege that the Respondent’s measures
were in breach of its obligations under the Off-Take Agreements and the MGP program and, therefore, in breach of
the ECT’s Umbrella Clause.

each year and updated for inflation, which indicated to investors that, if anything, the prices

would increase each year.**°

The Claimants argue that Italy’s reduction of the MGP granted to its 338 Carlino plants
under 100 kW is a departure from the AEEG’s original objectives of ensuring that MGPs
safeguard the economic survival of smaller PV plants. In support, FTI advances the view
that the MGP applied from 2014 onwards “is not nearly sufficient to cover the plants’ total
cash operating costs.”**’ Since the post-2014 MGP was only higher than €38.9 /MWh in a
very few instances in 2014 and lower than the market price from 2015, and since plants
only benefit from the MGP when it is above the market price for electricity, the Claimants’
position is that the Carlino plants no longer benefit from the MGPs. As indicated above,

the average national electricity price in 2014 and 2015 was approximately €52/MWh.

The Claimants also allege that the entry into Off-Take Agreements with the GSE, pursuant
to the terms of the Off-Take Regime, confirmed their expectation that prices would be
established in accordance with the AEEG Resolution which promised to establish prices to
ensure the economic survival of qualifying plants “even in case the market prices were to

fall significantly.”***

The Claimants say that the Respondent’s “unexpected” and “drastic” decrease of the MGP
to €38 in 2014, and its effective elimination of the Regime entirely for their plants,

breached both the purpose of the Regime and the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.**°

It is undisputed between the Parties that the purpose of the Off-Take Regime when it was
originally introduced by the AEEG was to cover the relatively higher operating overhead
that smaller facilities experience and to ensure their survival by ensuring a minimum level

of remuneration independent of the electricity market.*#° However, the Parties dispute what

items should be included in considering what the Claimants’ plants’ costs are and whether

or not the MPG set by Italy from 2014 onwards was adequate to cover those costs.

624. The Politecnico Report, on which Italy relied in deciding to reduce the MGP, assessed the
average operating costs of electricity production from renewable sources with capacity up
to 1 MW by reference to the Levelized Operating Cost of Electricity, or “LOCOE.” The
Politecnico Report states that the MGPs are “aimed at the recovery of operating costs,
maintenance and fuel, where applicable, but not investment costs” (namely, plant
development costs related to all phases from initial planning and diligence through
permitting to construction and connection of the plants to the grid).**! Although the Report

2 FTI states that Politecnico did not include all

considered several categories of costs,
costs that PV plants incur, such as management services or leasing the land on which the
plant is situated.**? In one example, FTI estimates that the Politecnico’s analysis represents
less than half of that plant’s total cash costs.**4 FTI further points out that the Politecnico
Report does not state the total number of plants included in the dataset and that it is unclear
whether its statistics are for particular or multiple plants; if individual plants, FTI says the
data represents, at most, 16 plants from 2007-2013.**> FTI concludes that the Politecnico
Report does not demonstrate a clear decrease in operating costs over time, which is
important when considering Italy’s argument that the MGP had to be readjusted to account
for the significant fall in operating costs over time.*#° Even if operating costs had declined
over time for the Claimants’ existing plants, there would not be an economic justification

for reducing the MGP because older plants would not necessarily have benefitted from

such trend without newer technology and, in any event, the Claimants were locked into

long-term Operating and Maintenance agreements. **”

As will be discussed further under the quantum analysis, below, the Claimants allege that
the Respondent’s breaches flowing from the change in the MGP amounts to a reduction in
the value of their investments of €4.8 million (presumably over the 20 year duration of the
Conto incentive regime, although the Claimants do not directly state for how many years
they expected the MGP to remain between €72 and €106 per MWh on the basis of the
2007-2013 MGP).*48 The Claimants also say that the additional revenues that would have
been earned by their plants which originally benefitted from the MGP scheme in 2014, if
the Respondent had not reduced the MPG and eliminated it for the Claimants’ plants, after
tax, is €8 10,123.

(ii) The Respondent's Arguments

The Respondent denies that any legitimate expectations in the Claimants could arise from
the Off-Take Regime. It says, in the first place, that the primary legislation, Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003 and Law No. 39/2004, created a broad framework for an Off-Take
Regime and did not refer in any way to a favourable mechanism such as MGPs. According
to the Respondent, no legitimate expectation could arise from the primary legislation set

out in an autonomous regulation adopted by the AEEG.*°°

The Respondent contends that only AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007 is relevant for
assessing Claimants’ expectations, because it was adopted one year before the beginning
of their Investments.**! The Respondent relies on the provision of Resolution No.

280/2007 which states that the MGPs are determined yearly by the AEEG for its argument

that the Claimants cannot have expected that such power would be exercised by the AEEG

without modifying the incentive scheme.*

Further, since the AEEG simply determined the modalities of the Off-Take regime in
accordance with legislation, the Respondent argues that there can be no basis for any
legitimate expectation arising from the AEEG Resolution.**? The Respondent says that
Resolution No. 280/2007 reshaped the Off-Take regime and introduced some crucial
modifications regarding MGPs before the Claimants made their investments. That
Resolution provided for the yearly determination of the MGPs by the AEEG and did not

provide any limits or ranges on the definition of minimum prices.*™*

The Respondent goes on to argue that the reference in the preamble of AEEG Resolution
No. 280/2007 to “ensur[ing] the economic survival of smaller plants, even in case the
market prices were to fall significantly” did not limit the power or authority to determine
minimum prices. In any event, the Respondent says that “economic survival” of smaller
plants would not grant a right to a high enduring profitability.**> The Respondent asserts
that Resolution No. 280/2007’s preamble refers to the “economic survival” of smaller

plants, and argues that “the 2013 reform” “well grants such a minimum level of prices.”**°

The Respondent also contends that a trend in the MGP is not sufficient to create an
expectation regarding their maintenance over time. Specifically, the Respondent contests
the Claimants’ assertion that the AEEG’s maintenance of the MGPs between €72-106 per
MWh for six years (2008-2013) gave rise to an expectation that the Prices would be more
or less “within that range” in subsequent years.*°’ The Respondent argues that this period

of time can neither be relied on “for a basic representation of future scenarios,” nor can it

“create an expectation regarding their maintenance prices over time.”*°* The Respondent
submits that this is particularly the case given the “incongruity regarding the time the
investments were made” (2008-2010).*°° It also notes that AEEG’s Resolution
280/2007 came into effect in 2008 and that the Claimants’ investments occurred in the

2008-2010 timeframe.

Italy’s position is that the MGPs “represents a duplication of the [Conto Energia Decrees]
incentive” and that Italy made clear that the MGPs “could be amended.”* The Respondent
says that the calculation of MGPs under the Resolution 280/2007 included the possibility
that the prices determined by the AEEG could be lower than market prices. As a result, the
regulation implied that in future, the AEEG could reduce the minimum price on the basis
of a decrease in the operational costs of the PV plants. The Respondent points out that the
underlying regulatory framework therefore does not create an expectation of a stable MGP

trend over time.**!

The Respondent also denies that its regulatory framework provided any basis for an
expectation that MGPs would continue to be available in addition to incentive tariffs for
medium and large PV plants with a capacity of more than 100 kWh. The Respondent says
that the fact that this had occurred for some years does not provide a basis to find that a

rule permitting this existed.*

In any event, the Respondent says that its measures were reasonable and consistent with
the legislative framework. The Respondent asserts that the MGPs had originally been fixed
on a temporary basis pending an accurate determination of operational costs of small
plants.** Further, the Respondent says that it undertook a consultation process in which it

shared its analysis of costs with the market and commissioned a report from Politecnico di

costs. As a result, the AEEG determined it was appropriate to adjust the Off-Take Regime.
The Respondent says that it consulted the market at a first stage in order to collect data
which were then used for the preparation of the Politecnico Report which was then the
subject of a further consultation.*°* The Respondent notes that the Claimants did not raise

any criticisms on the Politecnico Report at the time.

634. With respect to the termination of the right to obtain both incentive tariffs and MGPs, the
Respondent notes that this did not affect plants with a capacity of less than 100 kWh, which
are smaller PV plants. Therefore, the Respondent says that its actions were consistent with

the legal rationale of the minimum prices regime.*®>

635. The Respondent’s quantum experts, GRIF, assert that the Claimants’ purported expectation
that the MGPs would remain stable at approximately €79/MWh, “before they are
differentiated based on the actual operating costs incurred by each specific renewable
source, is completely specious and unjustified.” GRIF’s position is that Italy’s intention
“has always been to align these schemes with market parameters.”*°° In this regard, the
Respondent argues that Resolution No. 280/2007 explicitly foresees the possibility that the
MGPs determined by the AEEG would be lower than market prices.*°

GRIF underscores in its reports and hearing testimony that the MGPs were “not an
unexpected measure” and that, in fact, the “signals of a need to revise the [MGP] scheme
were present since 2003” and evolving ever since.*°* GRIF states that, since 2007, investors
knew that the MGPs would be changed and become less profitable, as set out in AEEG
Resolution No. 280/2007.°° Citing the Purchase and Sale Agreements for Claimants’
Carlino plants, which state that the MGP are “legally regulated by the AEEG (Italian
authorities for gas and energy), but this amount is not guaranteed for 20 years,” GRIF
testified that “everyone was clear that [the MGP] was not a measure destined to last

further.”8”

(iii) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The background and development of the Off-Take Regime is complex. The legislation and
relevant decrees are separate from the Conto Energia regime. Further, they do not set a
specific MGP nor do they set a term over the course of which the MGP would be paid.
Rather, the MGPs are calculated and adjusted on an annual basis and the Off-Take
Agreements with the GSE were for one-year terms (albeit automatically renewable). In
addition, Article 16 of the Off-Take Agreement provides that the GSE retains the right to
modify the provisions of the Agreement consistent with any modifications and integrations
made to AEEG Resolution No. 287/2007, which signals the risk that the MGPs could be
unilaterally changed. Relevant to the facts of this case, MGPs had been paid for

approximately six years, including for two to three years after the Claimants invested.

However, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that a trend in the MGP from
2007 through 2013 is not sufficient to create an expectation regarding its maintenance over
time. There was no specific commitment regarding the MGP amount or duration in AEEG
Resolution No. 280/2007, nor in the Conto Energia Decrees or otherwise. Thus, in the
circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants had no legitimate expectation that the

MGP would continue at a certain level or at all. The Claimants’ complaints that the changes

related to the MGPs also breached the Respondent’s obligations under the impairment

clause of the ECT will be discussed further below.

e. Conclusions on Legitimate Expectations (FET) Claims

In summary, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Respondent created a legislative
scheme to incentivize private investment in its renewable energy sector that may not have
otherwise happened on a timeframe consistent with its EU obligations. The evidence
established that these incentives were necessary to attract investment, as the technology
had not yet developed to a point where it could compete with traditional energy sources —
both upfront investment costs and operating expenses were high. Italy created the Conto
Energia regime, which established specific FITs for plants that met certain criteria. This
regime was augmented by the MGP mechanism and Off-Take Agreements, which provided

further support for smaller producers whose operating costs were expected to be high.

It was established that it was on the basis of this regime, as a whole, that the Claimants
decided to make their investments. To this stage, the majority’s analysis has focused on
what was objectively reasonable for the Claimants to expect in light of the circumstances

that existed at the time that they made their investments in Italy’s developing PV sector.

The majority of the Tribunal has found that the Conto Energia regime created a legitimate
expectation that investments that were made in accordance with the specific timing and
criteria of each Conto would qualify for the corresponding tariffs set out in the legislation
for the expected life of the investment. The subsequent GSE Agreements entered into with
each individual investment confirmed the tariff rates. The GSE Agreements, which came
after the investments were already made, did not themselves create the expectation that the
tariff rates would remain unchanged, but they are contemporaneous evidence that the

expectation created by the legislation was a legitimate one.

Pursuant to the incentive system established by Italy, each investor generally and the
Claimants specifically were left to determine whether to make their investments in Italy
(or invest their money elsewhere) based on their own assessment of the expected rate of

return in light of their expected costs. Italy did not guarantee investors a specific rate of

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 248

return. Instead, it guaranteed a specific FIT for a fixed period of time. The Spalmaincentivi
Decree, which later reduced those tariffs, constituted a breach of the ECT toward the

Claimants.

643. With respect to the other Challenged Measures, the Tribunal has found that the Claimants
have not established that it was legitimate for them to expect that those incentives would
be maintained for the life of their investments. In the majority’s view, unlike the tariff rates,
there was no specific promise made by Italy that they would be fixed at a certain level for

a specific period of time.

644. For the avoidance of doubt, in accordance with the submissions made by the Parties, the
majority of the Tribunal has specifically considered the approach of the SunReserve v. Italy
tribunal with respect to FET under the ECT. The majority of the Tribunal agrees with that
tribunal’s formulation of the role of legitimate expectations in evaluating whether there has
been a breach of FET:

[T]here are broadly three questions to be answered as part of this examination: (a)
whether the investors in the case had any expectations based on any conduct of
the host State and if so, whether these expectations were legitimate; (b) whether
the investors relied on these expectations to make their investments in the host
State; and (c) whether the host State by its subsequent conduct frustrated these

expectations. If any of these three questions is answered in the negative, the
investors’ claim for breach of the FET obligation fails.8”!

645. However, the majority of the Tribunal has reached a different conclusion in its application
of this summary of the law to the facts. In the majority’s view, the evidence in this case
established that the Respondent breached its obligation to provide FET to the Claimants’
investments. First, by establishing the Conto Energia regime and, in particular, providing
that the FITs “shall remain constant in current currency for the entire twenty year period,”
the Respondent created the legitimate expectation that investors who met the requirements
under the relevant Conto Energia Decree would, in fact, be entitled to receive the
corresponding FIT rate for the duration of their investment. Second, the Claimants in this
case established that they relied on those expectations in making their decisions to invest.

Decree frustrated these expectations. It follows that the Claimants’ claim for breach of the
FET obligation as it relates to the Spalmaincentivi Decree succeeds. Arbitrator L. Boisson
de Chazournes disagrees with the manner according to which the extent of the investors’
legitimate expectations have been appraised by the majority. A balancing and weighing
exercise should have been conducted in light of the specific circumstances and facts of the
present case. She does not consider that the applicable regulation in Italy can be construed
as “specific assurances” of immutability. The Conto Energia Decrees could not create the
legitimate expectation that the tariffs and the payment terms would remain “constant” for

the duration of the 20-year term.

The Claimants also claim that the Challenged Measures violate other provisions of the

FET. The following sections of this award will address these claims.

TRANSPARENCY AND CONSISTENCY (ISSUE 4.1(C))
qd) The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants maintain that the Challenged Measures also breached the Respondent’s
obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to treat their investments transparently
and consistently. The Claimants say that this obligation is separate and in addition to the

obligation to respect an investor’s legitimate expectations. *”*

The Claimants say that Article 10(1) of the ECT requires states to “encourage and create
stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting
Parties to make investments in its Area.” Referring to the decision in LG&E v. Argentina,
the Claimants say that FET “consists of the host State’s consistent and transparent
behaviour, free of ambiguity, that involves the obligation to grant and maintain a stable

and predictable legal framework.”*”

a. Spalmaincentivi Decree

The Claimants say that the reduction of the Conto Energia tariffs under the Spalmaincentivi
Decree was inconsistent with the transparent framework that had been developed,
promoted and granted to the Claimants’ investments. They contend that the Respondent
replaced what was once a stable, transparent regime with uncertainty that undermined the
Claimants’ economic expectations when they decided to invest. The Claimants argue that
for several years, the Respondent made repeated commitments of fixed tariffs for 20 years
so that investors could help to develop its PV sector and reach its EU targets for renewable
energy. However, once those targets were met, and the Claimants’ investments were sunk,
the Respondent changed its policies and reduced the specific tariffs that had induced their
investments. According to the Claimants, the Spalmaincentivi Decree constitutes

inconsistent treatment that violates the FET standard.

Further, the Claimants say that if the Respondent knew that it could or would reduce the
tariffs it had granted for 20 years at a fixed rate, despite its repeated commitment that the
tariffs would remain constant for 20 years, then the Respondent was not treating investors

transparently.°”*

b. Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

The Claimants say that the imposition of the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs to
all of their PV plants was inconsistent with the transparent framework that had been
developed, promoted and granted to the Claimants’ investments. The Claimants say that
guaranteeing the tariffs in the Conto Energia Decrees, and then arguing that the
Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs were implicitly authorized all along, violates any
reasonable notion of transparency. Further, the addition of these charges demonstrate that
additional fees could be added by the Respondent without limit, thereby further

substantially reducing the value of the Conto tariffs.°”>

c. MGP/Off-Take Regime

652. The Claimants advance the same arguments as above in respect of the Off-Take Regime
and the MGP. In violation of the duty to provide consistency and transparency, the
Claimants say that for a number of years, the AEEG consistently established the MGP at a
range of between €72 and €106 per MWh of electricity produced. Then, in 2014 the
Respondent changed course and set the MGP well below market prices of €38. The
Claimants also say that two of the Respondent’s entities, the AEEG and the Government
took conflicting positions regarding the support for PV facilities and the Off-Take

Regime.*”

(2) The Respondent’s Arguments

653. Although the Respondent does not accept that an independent duty to act transparently and

consistently exists under the obligation to grant FET, it addresses the Claimants’ arguments

on the basis presented by the Claimants.*””

similar reasons, the Claimants argue that the imposition of the charges amount to a lack of good faith since their
investments were sunk at the time they were made and the Claimants cannot take measures to mitigate the harm caused
by the additional charged. See Claimants’ Reply, | 505. In addition, the Claimants also argue that the additional
charges violated the ECT’s Impairment Clause and the Umbrella Clause. See Claimants’ Reply, ff 506-507.

876 Claimants’ Memorial, {ff 225-233, 326. The Claimants say that the AEEG established the reduced MGPs in
Resolution No. 618/2013 for all eligible PV facilities, but that a few days later, the Destinazione Italia Decree
abolished the MGPs for any PV facility that also received Conto Energia tariffs. The Claimants say that in addition
to reversing its consistent MGP policy of 6 years, the Respondent no longer had a consistent, coherent policy regarding
MGPs. The Claimants note that the President of the AEEG requested the cancellation of the provision of the
Destinazione Italia regarding MGPs on the basis that it would neutralize the goals for which the MGP had been
introduced. Nevertheless, the provision of the Destinazione Italia was implemented, with only an exception of PV
plants with a capacity below 100 kW.

a77 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, {| 637-646. The Respondent addresses the cases referred to by the
Claimants and maintains that these all relate to the concept of legitimate expectations. According to the Respondent,
the only relevance of consistency is when assessing the legitimacy of a host state’s conduct with respect to an existing
investor’s expectations. Also according to the Respondent, the concept of consistency related to the broader concept
of reasonableness. In this regard, it refers to the authority cited by the Claimants, Mamidoil v. Albania, where the
tribunal defined inconsistency as a state’s ability “to exercise its sovereign power in a way that deviates unreasonably
from its previous conduct.” See Respondent’s Rejoinder, §] 349-350, citing Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum

a. Spalmaincentivi Decree

The Respondent argues that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was a public act fully accessible
and enacted by due process of law. Accordingly, the Respondent says that it fully respected

the concept of transparency.*’*

b. Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

The Respondent’s position is that each of the Challenged Measures was reasonable and

adopted consistently with its legislative and regulatory framework.*”

c. MGP/Off-Take Regime

With respect to the Claimants’ allegations regarding consistency and transparency, the
Respondent refers to its submissions in respect of the Claimants’ alleged legitimate
expectations, which it says demonstrate that the measures modifying the MGP were totally
consistent with the framework of primary rules which had created the regime and were

coherent with previous AEEG decisions. **°

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

While the Tribunal agrees that the language of Article 10(1) of the ECT indicates that
“transparency and consistency” could engage different aspects of the obligations to treat
investments fairly and equitably, it does not agree that the Claimants have demonstrated
that Respondent’s acts engage those obligations. The majority of the Tribunal has already
found that with respect to the Spalmaincentivi Decree, the Respondent breached its
obligation to treat Claimants’ investments fairly and equitably. The Claimants’ complaints
regarding transparency and consistency relating to the Spalmaincentivi Decree have been
addressed within the majority’s analysis on the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. The
Conto Energia regime was a transparent regime established to attract investment. In
passing the Spalmaincentivi Decree, the Respondent was acting transparently, but in doing

so, it violated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations based on the Conto Energia regime.

It follows that in passing the Spalmaincentivi Decree and reducing tariffs for existing
investments contrary to the Claimants’ legitimate expectations, Italy’s treatment of the

Claimants’ investments was also inconsistent.

With respect to the Administration Fee, Imbalance Costs, MGP and Off-Take Regime, the
Tribunal has found that the Respondent’s changes to those aspects of the regime did not
violate the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. Accordingly, regarding these other
measures, the Claimants’ complaints related to transparency and consistency must be
considered more generally. The complaint is not that each measure was not transparent.
The complaint is that these measures, in the context of the entire regulatory regime
established to attract investment, were not transparent or consistent, as they eroded the
value of the tariffs granted to investors and upon which their decisions to invest were based.
The Tribunal finds that, in the absence of specific commitments with respect to future
Administration Fee, Imbalance Costs, MGP or the Off-Take Regime, the Respondent did
not breach its obligations of transparency and consistency through these measures. Without
a specific guarantee that these costs, which both parties accept were foreseeable, or
additional incentives would remain constant for any length of time, the Tribunal finds that
it was not a breach of the Respondent’s obligations of transparency or consistency to adjust
its regime in this way. The Claimants’ complaints as to erosion of the value of their
investment through these indirect measures are more appropriately dealt with in the context

of their other claims. These will be addressed further in the following sections.
THE Duty OF Goon FAITH (ISSUE 4.1(D))

() The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants allege that the Respondent’s measures also breached the autonomous
element of FET treatment to treat investors in good faith.**' The Claimants say that the
duty of good faith is at the heart of the concept of FET and entails a sincere intention to

deal fairly with investors.

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s decision to attract and accept the benefits of
the PV plants and the capacity that the Claimants developed, while denying them the full,
originally promised benefits of the Conto Energia scheme upon which they relied in
making their investment, was not in good faith. The Claimants say that at the time the
Challenged Measures were adopted, they had already sunk their investment costs and could

not feasibly relocate their PV facilities.

a. Spalmaincentivi Decree

The Claimants maintain that the Respondent’s justification for the remodulation of the
Conto Energia tariffs through the Spalmaincentivi Decree, to bring down the cost of
electricity for end-users, was not a good faith reason or excuse for changing the rules. The
Claimants point to statements by GSE’s CEO that the burden on end-users to cover the cost
of the incentive was acceptable because the cost to the average consumer for the overall
support scheme of renewables was minimal.**? In addition, the Claimants say that the
Spalmaincentivi Decree targeted and affected only the PV sector and did not produce any

meaningful savings. **

b. Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

The Claimants also argue that the application of the Administration Fee and Imbalance
Costs was contrary to the original commitment of fixed tariffs for 20 years, and thus was

not in good faith.***

c. MGP/Off-Take Regime

The Claimants advance the same arguments as above in respect of the Off-Take Regime
and the MGP. The Claimants say that although Italy recognized the need to ensure the

economic survival of small PV plants under 1 MW with MGPs, it substantially and

See Claimants’ Memorial, { 332 and the sources cited therein. The Claimants also point to a statement that

arbitrarily reduced the prices and then effectively ended the regime for all of the Claimants’

standard, **5

(2) The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent contests that the concept of good faith constitutes an autonomous duty
within the FET standard, as argued by the Claimants.**° On the merits of whether the
Challenged Measures violated any duty of good faith, the Respondent relies on its
submissions with respect to the alleged infringement of the Claimants’ legitimate

expectations, set out above.**”

a. Spalmaincentivi Decree

The Respondent says that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was reasonable in its aim to maintain
a sustainable system of incentives and to ensure “an equitable remuneration of the costs of
investment and operation” of PV facilities.*** Italy also denies that the declarations of
certain politicians which warned that the Decree would spawn a backlash from investors,
referred to by the Claimants, do not alter or contradict the legal background of the incentive
regime set out in the Conto Energia Decrees. Further, for the Respondent, the various
statements made by the head of the GSE in 2010 explained the reasonableness and

legitimacy of the public policy goals underlying the Spalmaincentivi Decree.

b. Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

The Respondent denies that the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs are related to, or
constitute a means of indirectly reducing, the incentive tariffs as regulated by the Conto

Energia Decrees. In any event, the Respondent says that the Administration Fee was

intended to compensate for the costs of management, verification and control service by

the GSE.**°

The Respondent maintains that the violation of the requirement of good faith as part of the
FET standard requires proof of serious behaviour in bad faith. The Respondent says that
there can be no allegation that it failed to alert the Claimants of the Spalmaincentivi Decree,
which was openly published and was intended to implement the EU renewable framework.
Accordingly, the Respondent says that the Claimants have failed to prove any sort of

concrete bad faith against it.*°°

c. MGP/Off-Take Regime

With respect to the Claimants’ allegations regarding the duty of good faith, the Respondent
refers to its submissions in respect of the Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations, which
it says demonstrate that the measures modifying the MGPs were totally consistent with the
framework of primary rules which had created the regime and coherent with previous

AEEG decisions. *?!

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

As the majority of the Tribunal has found a breach of the FET obligations related to the
Spalmaincentivi Decree, there is no need to address good faith as a separate component

with respect to those measures.

With respect to the Administration Fee, Imbalance Cost, MGP and Off-Take regime, the
Tribunal has carefully considered the Claimants’ arguments that these measures breached
the Respondent’s good faith obligations under the ECT. Again, while it could be possible
for measures to breach good faith obligations independent from a breach of FET through
legitimate expectations, the Tribunal is not satisfied that these circumstances arise in this
case. There was no evidence that the Respondent’s intention in passing the measures was

to undo all of the benefits of the Claimants’ investments, as alleged. The Tribunal accepts

that the Respondent’s intention in passing the measures related to revisiting the system in
light of developments in the market, balancing the interests of various stakeholders in the
system and complying with its obligations to the EU. A state’s obligations of good faith
must be assessed in the context of a state’s function, which includes regulating in areas
where there are competing interests. In short, the Respondent was not acting in bad faith in
passing the Challenged Measures. Again, the Tribunal is of the view that any issues relating
to the impact on the value of the Claimants’ investments arising from the Respondent’s
transparent measures passed in good faith are more appropriately dealt with in the context

of the Claimants’ other claims.

E. UNREASONABLE OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES AND THE IMPAIRMENT CLAUSE
(IssuE 4.2)

671. The Claimants contend that each of the Challenged Measures also breaches the Impairment
Clause contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT, which reads as follows:
Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and

no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.*”?

() The Claimants’ Arguments

672. The Claimants submit that the requirement not to impair investments by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures is a separate, standalone obligation. Although there may be some
overlap between the impairment and FET standards, the two obligations give rise to
separate claims which require independent analysis. The Claimants maintain that, in fact,

the Challenged Measures offend both the FET standard and the Impairment Clause.**

673. The Claimants contest the Respondent’s position that the impairment in question must be
significant in order violate Article 10(1) of the ECT.** According to the Claimants, the

case law sets out a low threshold for the requisite impact on an investment, as evidenced

89 ECT: C-001, Art. 10(1). The Claimants do not advance a claim relating to the first part of the sentence

addressing constant protection and security. Rather, they rely on the second half of the clause.

by the word “any” impairment in Article 10(1) of the ECT.** The Claimants argue that
interpreting the clause to encompass only large or significant impairments would distort
the meaning of the clause.**° In addition, the Claimants argue that the use of the disjunctive
“or” in the third sentence of Article 10(1) indicates that either unreasonable or
discriminatory measures will violate the obligation.*°? Whether the Tribunal finds the
Challenged Measures unreasonable or discriminatory (or both), the Claimants assert that

the measures violate the ECT’s Impairment Clause.***

The Claimants focus on the alleged unreasonableness of the Challenged Measures.*”? The
Claimants say that a measure is unreasonable if it is taken without due consideration of the
potential negative effects it will have on foreign investors.*”° In this regard, the Claimants
rely on LG&E v. Argentina for the proposition that a state’s rational decision-making
process “would include a consideration of the effect of a measure on foreign investments
and a balance of the interests of the State with any burden imposed on such investments.”°°!
Further, the Claimants say that the reasonableness of a measure must be judged from the
standpoint of the parties’ expectations at the time of the decision to invest rather than what
the state may have subsequently and unilaterally viewed as “reasonable” from a policy
perspective.” In support, the Claimants refer to BG Group v. Argentina, where the tribunal
held that the withdrawal of assurances given in good faith to investors to induce
investments violated their legitimate expectations and was “by definition unreasonable and

a breach of the treaty.”°°

The Claimants say that each of the Challenged Measures violated the impairment clause

since they were clearly unreasonable and impaired the Claimants’ investments.°™ They say

that these measures violated the basic premise behind the incentive support schemes, which
had been enacted specifically to encourage investment in a sector defined by significant
upfront costs and developing technology, and thus were designed to ensure revenue streams
for PV investors for a fixed duration due to their inability to compete with traditional
energy producers without such support. According to the Claimants, the Challenged
Measures were adopted for the political motivation of a new administration. The Claimants
say that the Respondent gave no sound justification for any of the Challenged Measures.
Further, the Respondent had no regard for the financial impact of its Measures on PV

producers such as the Claimants.

a. Spalmaincentivi Decree

The Claimants allege that the Spalmaincentivi Decree violates the Respondent’s obligation
not to impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of an investment
by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.”®° The Claimants argue that in determining
what is reasonable, it is necessary to consider the effect of the Spalmaincentivi Decree on
investors in light of the Respondent’s obligations under the ECT’s Impairment Clause. The
Claimants submit that Italy has not pointed to a reason for the Spalmaincentivi Decree’s
reduction of the Conto tariff rates that is justified in light of Italy’s duty under the ECT.
The Claimants aver that, even if the Spalmaincentivi Decree was motivated “by a vague
(and unsubstantiated) need to save costs,” BG Group v. Argentina confirms that the
withdrawal of undertakings and assurances given in good faith to investors in the Conto
Energia Decrees as an inducement to their making an investment is, by definition,

unreasonable and a breach of the treaty.°””

The Claimants also refer to the award in Toto Costruzioni v. Lebanon, which held that:

An unreasonable or discriminatory measure is defined in this case as (i) a measure
that inflicts damages on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate
purpose; (ii) a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion,
prejudice or personal preference{:] (iii) a measure taken for reasons that are

different from those put forward by the decision maker[;] or (iv) a measure taken
in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.

The Claimants say that the Spalmaincentivi Decree violates the Respondent’s Impairment

Clause obligation in all of the ways set out above.°°?

First, the Claimants allege that the Spalmaincentivi Decree inflicts damage on the
Claimants without serving any apparent legitimate purpose. The stated purpose for the
measure in end-users’ electricity bills, the Claimants say that no legitimate purpose was

served and that the only effect of the measure was to inflict damage on their investments.?!°

Second, the Claimants allege that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was not based on proper legal
standards because it violated non-retroactivity principles and targeted PV producers in a
discriminatory manner, while ignoring all of the other renewable energy players that
benefit from that system.!! It also preferred the interests of users and other types of
renewables producers over those of PV producers. The Claimants say that this was also

discriminatory, as different sectors of the energy market were treated differently.

Third, the Claimants allege that the Spalmaincentivi Decree is a measure taken for reasons
that are different from those put forward by the Respondent. The Claimants submit that,
contrary to the Respondent’s purported motivation behind the Spalmaincentivi Decree —
that consumers were overburdened and needed a reprieve from the cost of the guaranteed

incentive tariffs — the measure was “simply political pandering.

Finally, the Claimants argue that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was enacted by Italy without
regard for proper procedure because it unilaterally and unreasonably modified the GSE
Agreements, which required the mutual agreement of the parties.’'+ The Claimants say that
it was unreasonable to impose unilateral changes on the contractual relationship governing

their PV facilities.

b. Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

The Claimants maintain that the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs were
unreasonable, and that it was unfair for the Respondent to impose them on PV investors
that had invested in reliance on an incentive framework that did not include such costs.’!>
The Claimants say that the Respondent must have contemplated that the GSE would incur
costs in managing the Conto Energia system and that those costs would be paid out of the
difference between the A3 charges to consumers and the tariffs it agreed to pay PV

producers. Imposing those costs on producers after a number of years was an indirect way

of reducing the tariff.

With respect to the Administration Fee, the Claimants note that the Respondent maintains
that it designed it to cover “the high costs of the public function of the general management
of the system” and “in particular [the] audit and investigation” of those facilities.?'° The
Claimants say that although the Respondent gives the total recorded costs of the GSE in
2013 (€36.4 million), it does not allege that the GSE had difficulty covering its costs in
previous years or that its total costs had increased from previous years. Further, the
Claimants say that the Respondent has not disclosed what the GSE’s costs were in previous
years and that there was no indication that the GSE’s costs suddenly increased in 2013.
The Claimants also note that the number of audits and inspections carried out in

2013 demonstrated that only 5% had resulted in a “negative outcome” for the Producer.

Therefore, there was no demonstrated need for these inspections which would support the

imposition of the Administration Fee.°!”

In addition, the Claimants challenge the Respondent’s justification for the Administration
Fee that PV investors benefited from the system. They say that the public at large benefited
from the PV incentives and it was because of those benefits that the Respondent had
decided to design its support scheme to ensure that electricity consumers covered the costs
of the PV incentives in the first place. As such, there was no reason why the consumers
should not also cover the costs of managing the system, rather than the PV producers

alone.?!®

The Claimants advance similar arguments in respect of the Imbalance Costs. They say that
imbalance costs are a known cost of any electricity system. A renewable energy support
scheme can be designed to allocate imbalance costs to producers or to absorb them within
the system by, for example, charging them to consumers or to other producers. The decision
of whether to charge imbalance costs to renewables producers is inseparable from the level
of tariff support, because if producers bear that risk, they will require additional

compensation to off-set it.?!

The Claimants say that the imposition of the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs
caused a loss for each Producer with respect to the overall Conto incentive granted and
notes that the Respondent accepts this.°”° They say that imposing these fees and costs is

Page 263

The Claimants contend that the “leading” and “clearest” example of the Respondent’s

alleged violation of the ECT’s impairment clause is its modification of the MGP under the

Off-Take Regime.°”?

The MGP was designed to address the higher operating costs of smaller plants under 1 MW

and the Claimants assert that for 6-7 years they operated in a range that did in fact provide

the intended protection before “Italy suddenly gutted the programme’

opportunistic and unreasonable time” — namely, when market prices were low.?”?

The Claimants argue that Italy cannot defend its new MGPs by showing that they correlate

to any rational data or new policy, and thus its assertion that the reduced prices remained

aimed at covering the operating costs of small PV plants is false.°”* The Claimants contend

that the reduced prices were inadequate to cover their actual operating costs and,

what is

more, Italy excluded the Claimants’ plants from the regime altogether.?> The Respondent

claims that the decrease in operating costs across the PV industry obviated the need of

plants between 100kW and 1 MW to benefit from the MGP program. The Claimants

counter that the Respondent has not provided evidence that this modification resulted from

any decrease in the operating costs of its plants under 1 MW.°?6

The Claimants further assert that Italy’s fact witness, Mr. Miraglia, confirmed that the GSE

does not monitor the operating costs of PV plants.°”’ Therefore, Italy had no insight into

whether operating costs declined, and thus its stated motivation for cancelling the

Minimum Guaranteed Price program is not a rational policy.°?* The Claimants refer to the

second FTI expert report, which confirms that there is no evidence of any decrease in

operating costs and that the new Minimum Guaranteed Price of €38.9 is not sufficient to
cover the operating costs of any of the Claimants’ plants (even if they could still benefit
from it, which they cannot).°”° According to the Claimants, the “abolition” of the Minimum
Guaranteed Price program was therefore unreasonable and a violation of the ECT’s

impairment clause.°*°

(2) The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent argues that there is substantial overlap between the Claimants’ claims of
unreasonable or discriminatory measures and FET, particularly with respect to the
legitimate expectations analysis.”! The Respondent recalls its arguments under FET and
reiterates that its measures were reasonable and were non-discriminatory, which it asserts

is the key point for the concrete application of the impairment clause.*??

The Respondent contends that any impairment must be “significant” in order to violate the
ECT’s impairment clause, and cannot just be “any” violation as the Claimants contend.?*
The Respondent says that the meaning of “impairment” should be determined by making
reference to the legal context of the clause in order to avoid that marginal negative effects

suffered by a foreign investor could lead to a claim before an international tribunal.***

The Respondent also relies on its arguments relating to the question of “reasonableness”
advanced in respect of the Claimants’ allegations relating to an alleged breach of their
legitimate expectations. The Respondent refers to the interpretation of “unreasonable
measure” provided by the tribunal in AES v. Hungary, which held that the following two

elements must be analysed to determine whether a state’s act was unreasonable: “the

a. Spalmaincentivi Decree

The Respondent argues that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was enacted for a legitimate
purpose and was a reasonable measure.**° The Respondent says that the sharp growth of
PV energy production and the rapid development of technology, which was a particular
characteristic of PV energy production, required it to evolve the public system of economic
incentives. It says that its treatment of PV producers differed from that of other renewable
energy producers because of its different characteristics. The Respondent says that
discrimination cannot be proved by simply highlighting a difference between two situations

which are not comparable.”

With respect to the Claimants’ contention that it disregarded proper procedure by
modifying the GSE Agreements, the Respondent says that all legal procedures regarding
the GSE Agreements, which are exclusively regulated by Italian law, were fully respected

and that this was confirmed by the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision.**

MGBP, and thus the MGP changes cannot be said to impair the Claimants’ investments.
Rather, the MGP was only valid for the one-year duration of the GSE Off-Take
Agreements, which “automatically renewed only as long as no new legislation or
regulations are introduced.”°*? The Respondent argues that the 2013 Politecnico Report
found that, compared to the production costs used for the purposes of the previous
Resolution No. 103/2011,%*! the reduction to the MGP brought about by AEEG Resolution
No. 618/2013 was a product of a reduction in operating costs (mainly insurance and
maintenance), which is most pronounced in the case of power plants between 40 kW and

100 kw.”

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 10(1) of the ECT prohibits Contracting Parties from “... in any way impair[ing] by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures [an investment’s] management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposal.” Although this prohibition is found in the same article of the
ECT as the FET protection, the Tribunal finds that the ECT’s non-impairment clause is a
separate and distinct standard of protection from FET, albeit related.°4? While conduct that
breaches the FET standard will usually also breach the Impairment Clause (measures found
to be unfair or inequitable will usually also be unreasonable), the converse is not
necessarily true. The Impairment Clause protects against a particular type of state action.
In order to receive this protection, the Claimants must demonstrate that the measures were
either unreasonable or discriminatory and that they impaired the management,
maintenance, use enjoyment or disposal of their investment. Thus, a two-part analysis is
required. The first part focuses on the measures themselves and whether they are either
unreasonable or discriminatory. If they are found to be either unreasonable or
discriminatory, then an impairment must be shown. At that stage, the ECT’s clear language

provides that any impairment will be sufficient to establish a breach of the ECT. In other

words, any reasonableness analysis relates to the reasonableness of the measures and not
to whether the impairment was reasonable. The Respondent was thus obliged to avoid
“any” impairment of the Claimants’ investments by either unreasonable or discriminatory

measures.

The Tribunal has noted the Respondent’s argument that this interpretation of the ECT could
lead to claims for measures that have only marginal negative effects — a type of floodgates
argument, which it says was not the intention of the Contracting Parties. While this could
theoretically result, it does not mean that this interpretation is incorrect. Once the measure
is found to be unreasonable or discriminatory, the extent of the impairment would be
assessed in determining damages. It seems unlikely that such a claim would be pursued by
a commercial party if significant impairment, i.e. damages, had not occurred. The
Respondent’s concerns regarding this interpretation leading to a proliferation of claims is

unfounded.

Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal finds that there is no requirement that the
impairment be “significant” in order for a claim to succeed. Rather, impairment “in any
way” is all that is required. In the majority’s view, the ECT protects against any impairment
of the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of an investment,
provided it is caused by unreasonable or discriminatory measures. The majority of the
Tribunal notes that the majority of the authorities cited to it and those that it finds most
persuasive have adopted this interpretation.*** For instance, the Saluka v. Czech Republic
tribunal found that, in accordance with its ordinary meaning (Article 31 of the VCLT),

“impairment” means “any negative impact or effect by ‘measures’” taken by the host state,

See e.g., Saluka v. Czech Republic: CL-057, §§] 458-459 (citing Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v.

Canada), Judgment on Jurisdiction of the Court, 4 December 1998, ICJ Reports (1998) (“Fisheries Jurisdiction”),
{| 66); CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic, I\CSID Case No. ARB/O1/8, Award, 25 May 2005
(“CMS y. Argentina”): CL-071, § 292 (noting that arbitrariness must result in the impairment of the investment);
Azurix v. Argentina (Award): CL-082, ¥ 393 (“The question for the Tribunal is whether the measures taken by the
Province can be considered to be arbitrary and have impaired ‘the management, operation, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal’ of the investment of Azurix in Argentina.”).

and that measures cover any act, step, proceeding or omission by the state, regardless of

their content or aim.°4°

The majority of the Tribunal notes that, in any event, the Claimants allege that the

impairment caused by the Challenged Measures was significant.™*°

The key to establishing a breach of the Impairment Clause is to demonstrate that the
measures complained of are either unreasonable or discriminatory. The Tribunal notes that
there is no requirement that they be both unreasonable and discriminatory because Article
10(1) of the ECT uses the disjunctive “or” instead of the conjunctive “and.”°*” The Tribunal
accepts the indicia set out in the Toto Costruzioni v. Lebanon case, quoted above, to the

effect that an unreasonable or discriminatory measure must either:

e inflict damages on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate

purpose;

¢ be based on discretion, prejudice or personal preference rather than on legal

standards;

¢ be taken for reasons that are different than those put forward by the decision

maker; or
© be taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure. *4*

Following BG Group v. Argentina, the majority of the Tribunal notes that the question of
“reasonableness” should be measured against the expectation of the parties, “rather than as
a function of the means chosen by the State to achieve its goals.” The BG Group cited the
following passage from the CMS v. Czech Republic award approvingly, which majority of

this Tribunal finds instructive in guiding the exercise of its arbitral discretion:

As with the fair and equitable standard, the determination of reasonableness is in
its essence a matter for the arbitrator’s judgment. That judgment must be exercised
within the context of asking what the parties to bilateral investment treaties should
jointly anticipate, in advance of a challenged action, to be appropriate behaviour

in light of the goals of the Treaty.

Italy adopted certain measures to address its economic, political and social situation. The
Respondent submitted that the Challenged Measures were taken in part due to a purported
desire to reduce costs for end-users and ensure the sustainability of the incentive regime.
The Tribunal’s function is not to judge the reasonableness or effectiveness of such
measures as a matter of political economy,?*’ nor whether other measures were available
to achieve the goal. Instead, the Tribunal must interpret and apply Article 10(1) of the ECT.
In the majority’s view, the Tribunal must examine the purpose and aim of the ECT and
what the Contracting States should have jointly anticipated, in advance of the Challenged

Measures, to be appropriate conduct in light of those goals.

The Tribunal notes that in the course of the proceedings, the Claimants shifted the emphasis
of their impairment clause claim from the Spalmaincentivi Decree (although not
abandoning it with respect to legitimate expectations and the obligations to pay specific
amounts)?! to the Respondent’s modification of the MGP program and its imposition of

the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs.’

The Tribunal’s analysis will reflect that
shift, as well as the majority’s previous findings that the Spalmaincentivi Decree is a breach

of the FET obligation.

a. Spalmaincentivi Decree

The majority of the Tribunal has found that, through the Spalmaincentivi Decree, the
Respondent unilaterally modified the specific commitments (tariffs at a specific level fora
period of 20 years) that induced the Claimants to make their investments in Italy and that

this measure constitutes a breach of the FET standard in the ECT.

Having considered the Spalmaincentivi Decree in light of the Contracting Parties’ intention
of what would constitute reasonable conduct in relation to an investment protected by the
ECT, the majority of the Tribunal finds that Italy’s unilateral modification of the tariff rates
was also unreasonable conduct that breached the Impairment Clause. The purpose of the
ECT is to promote and protect investments in the energy sector. In light of that purpose, in
the majority’s view, it was unreasonable for the Respondent to alter the specifically

promised tariff rates upon which the Claimants relied in making their investment.

Borrowing from the dicta in AES v. Hungary, the majority of the Tribunal finds “that it
cannot be considered a reasonable measure for a state to use its governmental powers to
force a private party to change or give up its contractual rights.”°* If the state decides that
it should no longer observe the fixed incentive tariffs guaranteed in the Conto Energia
Decrees, which were confirmed in the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements, then it must
assume the consequences of its breach of the ECT; it withdrew specific assurances to the
Claimants made to induce them into making their investments despite its obligations under
the ECT. The majority of the Tribunal therefore agrees with the Claimants?* that Italy’s
reduction of the Conzo tariff rates that it had explicitly guaranteed would not change is not
reasonable, even if those reductions were motivated by a perceived need to maintain the

overall regime.

The majority of the Tribunal does not consider it to have been reasonable for Italy to have
enacted the tariff reductions in the Spalmaincentivi Decree in light of the specific
assurances contained in the Conto Energia Decrees, and later confirmed in the GSE Letters
and GSE Agreements. This measure was a breach of both the FET obligation and the
Impairment Clause. Arbitrator L. Boisson de Chazournes disagrees with the majority
when it considers that the Spalmaincentivi Decree constitutes an unreasonable conduct that
breached the Impairment Clause. The majority should have assessed the existence of a
rational policy as well as the reasonableness of the State act in relation to the policy pursued

by the host State, in the overall regulatory context of the case. Given that the investors’

remuneration is principally made of public subsidies, the minority finds it difficult to see
how reducing the cost of electricity to consumers by reducing the incentive tariffs for

producers cannot be considered as a rational policy goal.

b. Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

With respect to the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs, the Tribunal has found that
there was no specific promise made to the Claimants or their investments regarding these
fees and costs and that, accordingly, no there was no breach of the FET obligation in respect

of this measure.

The Tribunal must now determine whether the imposition of the Administration Fee and
Imbalance Costs upon the Claimants’ investments was either unreasonable or
discriminatory. The Claimants have not alleged that these measures were discriminatory.
For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal has determined that these measures were not

unreasonable.

While it is true that Italy did not impose these charges on Producers for 6 or 7 years
following the establishment of the incentive scheme, the imposition of new charges, by
itself, is not unreasonable when, as the Tribunal has found in this case, there were no
express promises made in respect of these types of charges. Was the imposition of
Administration Fees and Imbalance Costs unreasonable despite a lack of a specific
promise? In entering into the ECT, the Respondent accepted certain limitations on its
ability to regulate in ways that affected investments. The Tribunal notes that this does not
limit its right to regulate generally, but its regulations must be reasonable and non-

discriminatory in order to avoid conflict with its treaty obligations.

The Claimants’ allegations with respect to the Administration Fees and Imbalance Costs
and the Impairment Clause are essentially that these costs were known costs of the system
and that they were initially borne by others but later transferred to producers. The
Claimants argue this had the effect of indirectly reducing the tariff rates guaranteed under
the Conto Energia Decrees. While this may have been the effect, such an effect arguably

results whenever there is any increased cost allocated to producers. The Tribunal has found

714.

715.

716.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 272

that the Claimants could not have legitimately expected at the time of their investment that
there would be no changes to their costs under the regulatory scheme. In the absence of
specific promises, there was a risk that future costs might be allocated to the Claimants.
This was permissible as long as those costs were not imposed by measures that are

unreasonable or discriminatory.

Having found that the Claimants had no legitimate expectations at the time of their
investment with respect to Administration Fees and Imbalance Costs, the question becomes
one of the reasonableness of these measures being imposed 6-7 years after that time. The
Respondent submits that the reallocation of these costs to producers was part of its review
of its renewable energy support scheme and done to address the high costs of the
management of the system and the audit of the facilities. The Parties acknowledge that
these were known costs of the system, but unlike the tariff rates, no specific promises were
made in respect of them. Also, unlike the Spalmaincentivi Decree, there was no indication
that these measures were passed in order to reduce the tariffs received by producers. It was
a reallocation of costs that were foreseen at the outset, but were revisited in light of

experience with the actual operation of the system after a period of time.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the implementation
of the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs was unreasonable. The Respondent was
entitled to adjust its regulatory regime, so long as it did not do so unreasonably. The
Claimants may not have liked the purposes for which the changes were made and the
resulting modest increase in their costs, but, taking into consideration the indicia of
unreasonable and discriminatory behaviour set out in Toto Costruzioni v. Lebanon, the
Tribunal finds that none of those indicia were demonstrated with respect to the
Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs. Accordingly, the imposition of the

Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs do not violate the Impairment Clause.

c. MGP/Off-Take Regime

The MGP and Off-Take Regime as enacted at the time of investment provided further
incentives for investors to invest in Italy’s PV sector. However, the Tribunal has found that

the Respondent did not make any specific promises with respect to these additional

717.

718.

Award
Page 273

incentives in the legislation or elsewhere such as to create a legitimate expectation that
these would remain in effect. However, the Claimants maintain that these measures were
also unreasonable and violated the Impairment Clause because they must have been taken

for reasons other than those put forward by Italy.

The Off-Take Regime was created by the implementation of Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003.°*° The express purpose of the program, as originally conceived, was to
protect and ensure the survival of the smallest and most vulnerable PV plants (those under
1 MW), even if market prices were to fall significantly, by ensuring coverage of their
operating costs.°*° If requested by a PV producer of less than 1 MW, Italy guaranteed a
market which would provide it with a MGP if that price exceeded the wholesale price of
electricity. For plants that qualified for the MGP, it was effectively the minimum price and
the Conto incentives that a particular plant had qualified for applied on top of that price.
Therefore, the MGP served as a proxy for what would otherwise be the wholesale price, so
long as it was higher.?°’ The scheme itself contemplates annual review, as the MGP was
only valid for the one-year duration of the GSE Off-Take Agreements, which, in turn, could

be unilaterally revised in accordance with the legislation.?**

The AEEG commissioned periodic reports from the Department of Energy at the
Politecnico di Milano, a respected university, as to the operating costs of the renewable
energy producers.”°? In the 2013 Politecnico Report, it found that the overall production
costs had decreased by 53 percent for medium PV plants (3kW-100kW) and 49 percent for
large PV plants (100 kW and larger) compared to its analysis in 2010.°° Based on that
report and other consultations, the Respondent changed the eligibility criteria to qualify for

this program so that only small plants were eligible and adjusted the MGPs for those plants

to reflect the reported decreases in operating costs. The MGPs were based on the operating
costs and not the market prices providing protection to smaller producers when the market

prices were low and would not cover their higher operating costs.

The Claimants complain that this was unreasonable because the changes were not based
on actual operating costs and the new MGPs, even if their plants had remained eligible,
were insufficient to cover their actual operating costs. The effect of the measures on the
Claimants’ plants was exacerbated by the timing of the changes, which coincided with a

period of low market prices.

While both the timing and effect of these measures was unfortunate, the Tribunal is not
persuaded that they were unreasonable. Italy’s review and adjustment of the subsidies
provided to smaller producers, as foreseen in the legislation and Off-Take agreements, was
not unreasonable. Neither was its reliance on the 2013 Politecnico Report as the basis for
its changes. The Claimants no doubt had the right to complain to the Respondent about the
changes and the basis for them in light of their actual operating costs and the stated goal of
the legislation to protect smaller producers. However, the Tribunal is unable to conclude
that the measures amounted to a breach of the Impairment Clause, as none of the indicia of

unreasonableness have been established.

THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE (ISSUE 4.3)

The Claimants’ claims in this arbitration have been advanced primarily on the basis of
alleged breaches of the FET standard. Additionally, the Claimants argue that certain
measures: the Spalmaincentivi Decree; the imposition of imbalance costs and
administrative fees; and the changes to the MGP and Offtake regime also breached the
ECT’s umbrella clause protections, as set out in the last sentence of Article 10(1) of the

ECT (the “Umbrella Clause”).

The Umbrella Clause provides that “[e]ach contracting Party shall observe any obligations

it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 275

Party.”°*! The Claimants allege that each of the Challenged Measures adopted by the
Respondent breach obligations it entered into with the Claimants or their investments.°
The Claimants say that the scope of the Umbrella Clause is broad and includes not only
contractual obligations, but also obligations created through legislation or regulation and
submit that this interpretation is consistent with how other tribunals have interpreted the
ECT’s Umbrella Clause, as well as similarly-worded umbrella clauses in other treaties. The
Claimants also submit that there is no requirement that these obligations be reciprocal in
nature. The Respondent argues that the scope of the Umbrella Clause is much narrower
and only applies to contractual obligations or those of a similar nature. Further, the
Respondent says that in determining whether such an obligation was breached, the law
applicable to those obligations (in this case, Italian law) must be applied and that the

Claimants have not established that the Respondent breached any such obligation.

723. As discussed in other sections of this award, the Claimants and the Respondent have both
submitted numerous awards from other investment treaty cases as legal authorities in
support of their respective positions in this case. Many of these authorities have been cited
in relation to the Parties’ arguments in respect of the Umbrella Clause. The Tribunal has
reviewed each of these authorities and notes that while they provide some useful general
guidance, caution must be exercised in applying those conclusions in the instant case. In
reaching its conclusions, the Tribunal must consider the facts as proved and the particular

arguments presented by the Parties in this case.

724. For instance, the Tribunal notes that the Parties both urged the Tribunal to take a holistic
approach in reviewing the facts and considering the claims related to breach of the
Umbrella Clause. Although the Claimants maintain that each of the individual measures
breached a separate protected obligation, they note that, considered together, the Measures

fundamentally changed the economic framework enshrined in the legislation, regulations

961 ECT: C-001, Art. 10(1).
962 The Claimants also refer to Italy having “fail[ed] to reimburse Claimants’ facilities for charges assessed
improperly” in their Umbrella Clause claim: see Claimants’ Memorial, {| 357. As the Tribunal has found that these
particular measures are not within its jurisdiction, this aspect of the Umbrella Clause claim will not be considered
further.

and agreements that govern each of the Claimants’ PV plants, and thus disregarded the
obligations that the Respondent entered into with respect to the Claimants’ investments.
The Respondent, for its part, acknowledges that this forms the heart of the Claimants’
Umbrella Clause claim and argues that, in the event that the Tribunal finds any protected
obligations, the Tribunal should consider the entirety of the Respondent’s conduct —
measures that it says benefitted the Claimants, as well as those alleged to have harmed

them — in assessing whether the Umbrella Clause was violated.**

In the following sections, the majority of the Tribunal will provide its interpretation of the
Umbrella Clause and then review the Claimants’ specific claims for breach of the Umbrella

Clause and the Respondent’s positions in response.

dd) What is the Appropriate Interpretation of the ECT’s Umbrella Clause?
a. The Claimants’ Arguments

(i) The Umbrella Clause Covers “Any” Obligation “Entered Into” with an
Investor’s Investment
The Claimants advance the view that the Umbrella Clause has a wide scope and expressly
covers “any” obligations, which they say include statutory and regulatory undertakings that
Italy “has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other

Contracting Party.”

In support of their arguments for a wide interpretation, the Claimants rely on the plain
language of the Umbrella Clause, the awards of other tribunals and scholarly writing. The
Claimants say that all of these sources support their interpretation of the Umbrella Clause.
In particular, they assert that the purpose of the Umbrella Clause is to “[guarantee] the
observance of obligations ...” by elevating a breach of the underlying obligation into a

breach of the ECT.°

In addition to providing broad coverage for any obligations, the Claimants say that the
Umbrella Clause also specifically protects obligations owed to its investments. The
Claimants note that the language of the Umbrella Clause refers to obligations owed to
either an investor or “an Jnvestment of an Investor,” which they argue therefore expressly
includes correspondence with and contracts entered into between the Respondent and
Claimants’ locally-incorporated investment vehicles; in this case, the GSE Letters and GSE

Agreements.

As discussed above under the Respondent’s fourth jurisdictional objection, the Claimants
acknowledge that they have no independent right of action under the GSE Agreements’
forum selection clause.*° Thus, the thrust of the Claimants’ argument is that the GSE
Agreements were “entered into” by Italy with the Claimants’ investments for the purposes
of the Umbrella Clause and that the Claimants’ claims are therefore based on both the
Conto Energia Decrees and the GSE Agreements which confirmed the same obligations.°
All of the Claimants’ claims with respect to the alleged breaches of the GSE Agreements
relate to the corresponding ECT breach for breach of the obligations owed, not to breach

of the GSE Agreements themselves.

The Claimants submit that most of the cases considering the Umbrella Clause only involve

a state’s obligations expressed in either contracts or legislation, whereas in this case, both

731. The Claimants assert that the Umbrella Clause is “specifically intended to expand the reach
of the Treaty’s protections to obligations that might not be covered by the Treaty’s other
substantive provisions.”° The Claimants submit that the protection afforded by the
specific language of the Umbrella Clause is “the high watermark of investment treaty
protections ... perhaps the most pro-investor of all investment treaties.”°”° The Claimants
contend that every ECT tribunal that has considered the Umbrella Clause has
acknowledged that both contractual obligations and those undertaken through law or
regulation fall within its scope.°”! In this regard, the Claimants note that the wording of the
Umbrella Clause “does not differentiate between contractual obligations and other

undertakings, including those in laws, regulations, or correspondence.”?”

732. In applying an ordinary meaning interpretation pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, the
Claimants argue that had the ECT Contracting Parties wanted the Umbrella Clause to only
cover contractual obligations, they would have drafted “contractual obligations” instead of
“any obligation.”°’> The Claimants say that there is a clear line of ECT case law applying
the word “obligations” not only to contractual commitments, but also to legislative and
regulatory commitments, including A/-Bahloul v. Tajikistan, Plama v. Bulgaria, Amto v.
Ukraine, Khan v. Mongolia, and Eureko v. Poland.°" The Claimants refer to the Eureko v.

Poland award, where the tribunal observed that “any obligation” “means not only
obligations of a certain type, but ‘any’ — that is to say all — obligations entered into with

regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.”°”> Similarly, the Khan

tribunal held that Mongolia’s breach of its Foreign Investment Law constituted a breach of
the Umbrella Clause on the basis of a “plain meaning” reading of the term “any
obligation.”°”° The Claimants contest the Respondent’s assertion that the Khan v. Mongolia
case is distinguishable from the instant case simply because the tribunal stated that its broad
interpretation hinged on the ordinary meaning of the term “any” and the fact that Mongolia

did not argue in favour of a narrow reading of the Umbrella Clause.?””

733. The Claimants also contest the allegation by the Respondent that they omitted or distorted
the rulings on the Umbrella Clause in Plama v. Bulgaria and Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan?”
Although the tribunals in those cases referred to the narrow standard applied by the ICSID
ad hoc annulment committee in CMS v. Argentina, the Plama tribunal ultimately held that
the wording of the Umbrella Clause “is wide in scope since it refers to ‘any obligation,”
which ordinarily means “any obligation regardless of its nature, i.e., whether it be
contractual or statutory.”°”? Similarly, the A/-Bahl/oul tribunal stated that the ECT’s

umbrella clause “is broadly stated, referring as it does to ‘any obligation’ and, as such, by

the ordinary meaning of the words, includes both statutory and contractual obligations.”°*°

The Claimants contend that the A/-Bah/oul tribunal’s reasoning turned on whether the
relevant obligations were specific (as opposed to general obligations arising as a matter of
law) and involved consent by the investor and the state.**! As will be discussed below, the
Claimants assert that, in contrast, the statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations in

this case are very specific, in that they targeted specific types of investors, and offered them

their Umbrella Clause claim would be covered even under the more restrictive

interpretation in Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan.

The Claimants argue that other investment treaty tribunals, such as LG&E v. Argentina,
SGS v. Paraguay, Enron v. Argentina, and Continental Casualty v. Argentina, have also
adopted broad interpretations of similarly-worded umbrella clauses to that of the ECT.°**
The LG&E tribunal concluded that Argentina’s Gas Law “and regulations became
obligations within the meaning of [the BIT’s umbrella clause], by virtue of targeting
foreign investors and applying specifically to their investments.”°*> The Continental
Casualty v. Argentina tribunal echoed this reasoning and concluded that the umbrella
clause at issue in that case could also include the unilateral commitments arising from the
host state’s law regulating a particular business sector, and specifically addressed to

investors regarding their investments therein.**°

The Claimants contend that the Respondent “misleadingly” quotes SGS v. Philippines in
an attempt to characterize the umbrella clause as only covering contractual obligations.°*”
The Claimants assert that the clause at issue in that case was narrower than the Umbrella
Clause, but that nevertheless that tribunal adopted a broad approach which required “a State

to observe specific domestic commitments,” as the Claimants say is the case here.°***

The Claimants also contest the Respondent’s reliance on Noble Ventures v. Romania.

contracts,” the Claimants state that the tribunal limited its analysis to that point because the

claimant only argued for the clause to apply to domestic contractual commitments.”*?

737. In response to the Respondent’s submission that the ordinary meaning of “entered into”
requires an agreement or contract, the Claimants note that the Concise Oxford Dictionary
definition relied upon by the Respondent merely uses “an agreement” as an example of
what may be “entered into” so as to “bind oneself by (an agreement or other

commitment).”°"°

738. Further, in response to the Respondent’s allegations that the Umbrella Clause contains a
temporal requirement, the Claimants assert that the Umbrella Clause does not implicate
any issues of timing in terms of when various “investments” were made; rather, the analysis
“simply turns on whether Italy violated obligations it entered into with Claimants’
investments.”*”! In support of this position, the Claimants cite the Greentech majority
award, which refused to incorporate a temporal element into its Umbrella Clause analysis,
for to do so would be “incompatible with an appropriately broad interpretation of the
umbrella clause” which had “no hint of such a temporal dimension in the plain wording of

the ECT’s umbrella clause.”°°”

739. The Claimants note that the Respondent has not argued that a distinction should be drawn
between plants purchased before and after the GSE Agreements were executed. In
reference to later tribunal awards that did make this temporal distinction, the Claimants
point out that eleven out of the nineteen PV projects which they acquired were after their
entry into operation, but before GSE Agreements were executed and the remaining projects
were invested in after the GSE Agreements were executed. The Claimants say that all of

their investments met the criteria in the relevant Conto Energia Decree and that fact was

recognized by Italy when it issued the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements with respect to

each investment.

(ii) Italy Could Have Opted-Out of the Umbrella Clause But Chose Not To

Finally, the Claimants contest the Respondent’s position that the Umbrella Clause infringes
upon state sovereignty and thus should be interpreted restrictively.°?? The Claimants argue
that Italy’s intention to be bound by the broad Umbrella Clause is demonstrated by the fact
it did not avail itself of the explicit opportunity afforded the Contracting Parties to opt-out
of it by noting their decision in Annex IA to the ECT.°* The Claimants contend that
precisely because of the wide scope of the Umbrella Clause, each Contracting Party to the
ECT had the ability to opt-out of that provision, and Italy did not do so. The Claimants
cite academic commentary which notes that “the fact that States [can] ‘opt out’ of the
umbrella clause in the ECT logically reinforces the fact that it is intended to provide a very

broad protection to investors.”°°°

b. The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent contests the Claimants’ assertion that the Umbrella Clause covers
statutory and regulatory obligations and that “every ECT tribunal that has considered the
provision has acknowledged ... obligations undertaken through law or regulation fall
within its scope.”°”” Instead, the Respondent says that ECT tribunals have not offered
“well-defined positions on the point,” “which completely prevents ... a unitary
reconstruction of this legal institution.”°** For the Respondent, the Umbrella Clause covers
only contractual obligations, and thus regulatory acts are incapable of creating such

obligations.*”? The Respondent contends that the reason for this exclusion lies in the

rationale of the Umbrella Clause, which is to internationalize contractual obligations that

would otherwise remain excluded by the investment treaty due to their private nature. !°°°

The Respondent argues that the ordinary meaning of the phrase obligations “entered into”
in the Umbrella Clause means “to ‘undertake to bind oneself by’ ... ‘an agreement’.”!°°!
The Respondent asserts that the reference to “an agreement” in the definition of
“obligation” therefore restricts the meaning of the phrase “obligations entered into” t

obligations contained in contracts only.' In response to the Claimants’ rebuttal that
“entered into” applies to both an agreement and a commitment, the Respondent states that
“entered into with” implies negotiation between two parties, but that the Conto Energia
Decrees were not negotiated between investors and Italy, were not designed to induce

foreign investment, and were of a general character. !°

In the Respondent’s view, “to force the meaning of ‘entered into with’, to include under
the scope of the umbrella clause even legislative and governmental State obligations would
be illogical, as the FET standard already broadly addresses such kind of obligations.”!0%
The Respondent asserts that FET and the Umbrella Clause therefore “deal respectively with
two different kinds of State obligations (regulatory and contractual).”!°°> According to the
Respondent, “since the amount and duration of incentives are determined previously and
authoritatively by an external and public law source, the FET standard is the correct legal
parameter.” !06
The Respondent concludes that, in the absence of “well-defined positions” from ECT
tribunals on whether the Umbrella Clause also includes statutory and regulatory

obligations, and in contrast to the analysis suggested by the Claimants, its “more careful

analysis” demonstrates that no obligations can arise from statutory acts for the purposes of

the Umbrella Clause.'°”

Regarding the Claimants’ reliance on A/-Bahloul v. Tajikistan, the Respondent contends
that the Claimants omit to quote the full statement by that tribunal, which adds that the
“ICSID Ad Hoc Committee, in annulling the decision in CMS v[.] Argentina, took a
narrower view, and considered that the words ‘entered into’ suggest that the obligation is
limited to those of a consensual nature.”!°°S The Respondent submits that the A/-Bahloul
v. Tajikistan tribunal relies on the words “entered into” to conclude that the Umbrella
Clause “does not refer to general obligations of the State arising as a matter of law.”!°°
The Respondent contests the Claimants’ argument that, contrary to the general obligations
at stake in the A/-Bahloul v. Tajikistan case, the Respondent’s regulatory obligations were
specific and targeted at investors, for a specific duration, and guaranteed a specific
tariff.!°!° According to the Respondent, the Conto Energia Decrees were general in “both
their legal source and concrete rule” and were directed to “the generality of physical and
legal persons,” including private individuals and families who could (and did) start the

procedure to benefit from the FITs.!°!!

Similarly, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ reliance on Plama v. Bulgaria is
“distorted,” and that they “omit to give a complete account of the cited part of the
ruling.”!°!? The Respondent contends that the P/ama tribunal did not take a position on the
relevant issue for this case and instead merely “refers to two contradictory decisions within

the bunch of Argentinian cases at the time of crises, and thus simply gives account of both

possible interpretations by concluding that it ‘need not extend its analysis any further.””!°!

747. The Respondent submits that the non-ECT case law is also not well defined, save for Noble
Ventures v. Romania, which limits the application of umbrella clauses to only contractual

obligations. !°!4

748. In commenting on later tribunal decisions applying the Umbrella Clause, the Respondent
submits that in this case the Claimants have conceded that “Italy made no guarantees of

specific incentive rates with respect to PV facilities under development”'®'*

and suggests
that this is fatal to finding a breach of the Umbrella Clause on the basis of the legislation
alone. However, the Respondent notes that the Claimants’ articulation of the “obligations

. entered into with” it for the purpose of the Umbrella Clause mainly concerns the
guarantee of fixed incentives offered through ministerial decree and confirmed in the GSE
contracts.'°!© The Respondent argues that should the Tribunal find that such an obligation
is protected by the Umbrella Clause (which it opposes), the Tribunal should consider all of
the Respondent’s behaviour (and not just the Spalmaincentivi Decree) in order to properly

determine its good faith obligations at international law.!°!”

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis

749. The preliminary task of the Tribunal is to determine the scope of the Umbrella Clause. The
Tribunal notes that Article 10(1) of the ECT must be interpreted in accordance with Article
31 of the VCLT, which sets out the general customary international law rules of treaty

interpretation.

750. As noted earlier, Article 31 of the VCLT requires a treaty to be interpreted in good faith,
according to the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms used in that treaty, in their context

and taking into account the object and purpose of the treaty.!°!* Article 32 of the VCLT

permits recourse to supplementary means of interpretation in order to confirm the meaning

derived by application of Article 31 or to resolve an ambiguity. !°!

The ECT’s purpose is to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field in accordance
with the object and principles of the Charter. Article 10, found in Part II of the ECT, is
devoted to Investment Promotion and Protection. Article 10(1) requires each Contracting
Party to “encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for
Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.” Article 10(1) goes
on to set out four more specific conditions or protections: FET, constant protection and
security and impairment, minimum standard of treatment and the Umbrella Clause. As a
whole, Article 10(1) provides comprehensive protection for investments from certain state
acts in order to achieve the goal of providing “stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions” for investment. While each type of protection is distinct, there can be
overlapping coverage afforded by the various protections. In order to be able to assess the
Claimants’ claims with respect to the alleged breaches of the Umbrella Clause, it is
necessary to interpret the scope of coverage provided by the Umbrella Clause on its own

but in the context of the article and treaty in which it appears.

Pursuant to its plain meaning, the Umbrella Clause is intended to ensure that host states
observe “any obligation entered into with” the investor or its investment. The use of the
word “any” suggests that the drafters intended the protection to apply to any obligations,
but this on its own does not assist in interpreting what types of obligation were to be
covered. Reading this phrase as a whole indicates that the obligations intended to trigger
potential liability under the ECT were not just general obligations, but those that relate to
the investment. Further, the use of the phrase “entered into with” suggests that a certain
degree of specificity must exist and that the obligation or promise must relate to the investor
or its investment. There is no dispute that contracts between the state and an investor or its
investment are protected obligations under the Umbrella Clause. Italy does dispute whether

other instruments, such as legislation or regulations, are capable of creating obligations that

See, e.g., Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg 8.4.1.1. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom

of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31, Award, 15 June 2018 (“Antin vy. Spain”), 4 207, available at:

are also protected by the Umbrella Clause. Further, it submits that accessory contracts,
which give effect to such legislation or regulations, are also not protected; instead they
absorb the character of legislation or regulations, which it says cannot create obligations

protected by the Umbrella Clause.

Italy has argued that the phrase “obligation entered into with” requires a bilateral agreement
and that establishing a tariff system through legislation and giving effect to that system
through regulations, letters and accessory contracts is not sufficient to create obligations
entered into with the Claimants or their investments for the purposes of the ECT. In
particular, Italy focuses on the word “with” to argue that some degree of negotiation is

required for an obligation to be protected.

The Tribunal notes that reading the Umbrella Clause as a whole indicates that beyond
covered obligations having been “entered into with ... an Investment of an Investor,”!°”°
such obligations must identify both the promises made (the obligation) and the recipients
of those promises (who they were entered into with) with some degree of specificity —
enough to establish a relationship between the obligation and the investor or its

investment. !°7!

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the phrase “entered into” in Article 10(1) of
the ECT does not exclude the possibility of a state entering into commitments via
legislation or decree, or unilaterally through statements made in offering memoranda
designed to induce foreign investment. '°?? However, in order for such obligations to be
protected by the Umbrella Clause, a degree of specificity is required — the obligations must
be made with investors and be in relation to investment. A general statute regulating a
sector of the economy will not normally be sufficient. In this case, the Conto Energia
regime was intended to induce investment in the PV sector, but not necessarily by foreign

investors. The regime provided a conditional offer of specific tariff rates for a period of

ECT: C-001, Art. 10(1).

20 years. In order to be in a position to benefit from those tariffs, individual investors had

to meet the criteria.

In the majority’s view, for an obligation to have been entered into with the investor or the
investment for the purpose of the Umbrella Clause, the Conto Energia Decree on its own
was not sufficient; it was necessary for the Investor or its Investment to have met the criteria
and notified the Respondent that it had done so. The Claimants in this case accept that the
Respondent was entitled to unilaterally modify the regime with respect to prospective
investments, as it did. This implies that no protected obligation arose until the criteria were
met by an identifiable investment. The investment regime as designed by Italy did just this
— it converted the conditional offer of specific tariff rates to an obligation entered into with
a specific plant by confirming the obligation in the GSE letter addressed to the plant and,
later, in the GSE Agreement, which was entered into with each individual plant. By
operation of the Conto Energia regime, Italy created obligations entered into with each
investment. To the extent that those agreements were entered into with an Investor or its
Investment, failure to observe those obligations gives rise to protection under the Umbrella
Clause. The Umbrella Clause requires that the obligation be owed by the host state to either

the investor directly or to the investment.

Although it was not argued by the Respondent in this case, for the sake of good order, the
majority of the Tribunal notes that on its face, the Umbrella Clause does not require that
the investor own the investment at the time that the obligation was entered into. Unlike
FET protection, which examines the investor’s legitimate expectations at the time of
making its investment, the Umbrella Clause protection only arises if the host state fails to
observe an obligation it has entered into with the investment. Through the GSE Letters and
GSE Agreements, Italy confirmed the obligations set out in the Conto Energia Decrees
were owed to the specific plants that had met the criteria, which entitled it to the tariff rates
set out in the applicable Conto Energia Decree. If those obligations were not observed,

then an Investor could bring a claim under the Umbrella Clause.

The Tribunal finds that the plain and ordinary meaning of the Umbrella Clause does not

only protect contractual obligations, but is broad enough to cover any obligation even if

contained in legislation or regulations so long as the obligation was entered into with an
investor or its investment. In this case, the Claimants say that the obligation entered into
with its investments was to pay the tariff rates for a period of 20 years and, more generally,
to maintain a stable regime that protected smaller producers by not eroding those tariff
rates and other protections set out in the Conto Energia regime. It says this obligation was
entered into with its investments through multiple instruments: the Conto Energia Decrees,
correspondence from the GSE and the individual GSE Agreements, which are the clearest
evidence of the obligation. In light of the Tribunal’s interpretation of the Umbrella Clause,
it agrees that it is permissible to assess the Claimants’ claim for breach of the Umbrella
Clause by assessing whether these obligations were, in fact, entered into with Claimants’
investments whether by legislation, regulation, correspondence or contract, taken as a
whole. In other words, there is nothing in the Umbrella Clause that requires a protected
obligation to be tied to a single source. However, the obligation must have been entered

into with the investor or its investment.

(2) | What Obligations did Italy Enter Into With the Investors or their
Investments?

a. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants submit that the Respondent assumed obligations in respect of the Claimants’
investments through the legal, regulatory and contractual framework that it created to
encourage PV investments.!°?? The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s obligations
were not general in nature. To the contrary, the Claimants contend that each Conto Energia
Decree guaranteed fixed incentive tariff rates for 20 years, and that these specific
commitments were given to individual PV plants by the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements
acknowledging the eligibility of each PV producer, and confirmed their qualification for

the specific incentive tariff rate in the applicable Conto Energia Decree. '!°**

The Claimants’ position is that Italy entered into obligations with the Claimants’

investments in the GSE Agreements and in the offer-and-acceptance mechanism in the

1023 Claimants’ Memorial, 41356.

Conto Energia Decrees themselves. Although they argue that it is not required for the
purposes of the Umbrella Clause, the Claimants and their Investments also entered into
reciprocal obligations by developing, acquiring, and maintaining PV plants in Italy that
met Italy’s requirements, all of which was required to receive the guaranteed tariff

payments. 1025

761. According to the Claimants, the GSE Agreements provide the “clearest evidence of Italy’s
obligations under the ECT’s umbrella clause.”!°?° The Claimants submit that, by entering
into the GSE Agreements, the Respondent entered into obligations with each of the Italian
companies that own the Claimants’ 341 PV plants at issue.!°?’ Thus, the Claimants argue
that under the Umbrella Clause, the Respondent is bound to fulfil the obligations enshrined
in each GSE Agreement, which promised to pay a fixed tariff at a constant rate for a 20 year

period. !°78

762. The Claimants contend that the Respondent was fully aware that it was entering into
obligations with investments of foreign investors because each of the GSE Agreements
demonstrates the GSE’s acknowledgement that foreign nationals represented the Italian
companies that counter-signed those agreements. !°”° For example, with respect to Projects
Montalto and Carlino, the relevant GSE Agreements provide that the local company is
represented by Messrs. Thomas Engelmann and Curtaz Klaus Adolf, respectively, and

expressly notes that they were born abroad.'° The Claimants point out that Italy’s own

fact witness, Mr. Bacchiocchi, testified that Italy knew that there were “lots of foreign

companies. '3!

763. The Claimants assert that the GSE Agreements are covered by the Umbrella Clause
because they contained specific obligations that Italy entered into with the Claimants’
investments.'°? For example, in the GSE Agreement with the Claimant ICE 5’s
Investment, Ginosa Energia S.r.1., which operated the Ginosa project, Article 2 defines the

“Value of the incentive” as follows:

The incentive tariff to be granted to the [PV] plant under this Agreement, which
is constant in current currency, is equal to 0.2120 €/kWh, a value recognized by
the GSE and disclosed to the Soggetto Responsabile [i.e., plant operator] with the
communication on admission to the incentive tariff [i.e the GSE Tariff
Recognition Letter].!°*

Article 4 of the GSE Agreement provides:

Following the entry into force of this Agreement, the GSE shall provide for and
ensure that the payment of the tariff due occurs within 120 days from the date it
receives the application for admission to the incentive tariff ... The frequency of
the payments to [Ginosa Energia S r.1.] is defined as follows: ... for plants with
capacity greater than 20 kW, pursuant to the provisions in art. 11, paragraph 4 of
AEEG decision ARG/elt 181/10, the payment of the tariffs and the potential
addition or reward shall be executed on a monthly basis with value date as of the
last day of the second month subsequent to the reference month ... In the event
that the Payment Date falls on a holiday, the payment shall be made with value
date as of the first subsequent business day.!°4

 

 

Article 6 of that Agreement requires the GSE to:

[F]ulfil its obligation to pay receivables to the assignee [of the plant operator]
upon compliance with the following conditions. !°°5

regulatory framework: Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 287:7-288:12. Italy also widely promoted the incentive regime at

764. According to the Claimants, the Respondent does not contest the factual aspects of the
umbrella clause claim, and indeed admits that the Spalmaincentivi Decree resulted in a
change to the economic framework of the GSE Agreements. !°°° The Claimants contend
that the Respondent also admits that the GSE Agreements are binding on both the PV
operators and the GSE, but that the Respondent is wrong in arguing that the GSE
Agreements do not fall under the protection of the Umbrella Clause simply because the
contracts were required by law. !°7

765. The Claimants point out that the Greentech majority did not consider Italy’s classification
of the GSE Agreements as “accessory” (rather than private law contracts) problematic,
because they found that it was not necessary to view the GSE Agreements in isolation.!°**
The Claimants urge the Tribunal to adopt the reasoning of the Greentech v. Italy majority,

which held that

[t]aken as a whole, the Conto Energia decrees, the GSE letters, and the GSE
Agreements, amounted to obligations “entered into with” specific PV operators.
Those obligations were sufficiently specific, setting forth specific tariff rates for
a fixed duration of twenty years. Accordingly, whether any of the Conto Energia
decrees, GSE letters, or GSE Agreements would, in isolation, be covered by the
ECT’s umbrella clause is not the relevant question here, given that each of
Claimants’ investments received benefits pursuant to all three types of
“obligations.”!°

766. In response to the Respondent’s defenses, the Claimants assert that the Respondent’s
arguments regarding the purported exclusion of non-contractual obligations from the scope
of the Umbrella Clause are wrong for two reasons. First, the ECT’s Umbrella Clause covers

any obligations regarding investors or investments, not just contractual ones. Further, the

1037 Claimants’ Reply, 385. See dent’s Counter- ial, 4733: “The dent acknowledges that
the Claimants did not challenge any conduct of the GSE. This fact is not surprising, because, as noted above, the GSE
had no role in determining the content of the clause and consequently the purported violation of such contract is not
due to an autonomous act of the GSE, but to a subsequent authoritative measure that automatically produced a
modification of the Convention by law” (footnotes omitted).

type of contractual obligations is not restricted.'“° Second, the GSE Agreements fall

within the Umbrella Clause’s broad scope.!™*!

The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s proposition that the GSE Agreements do
not qualify as contracts, and reject its reliance on Noble Ventures v. Romania.'°* Rather
than cast doubt as to whether any contractual obligation is covered by the umbrella clause,
the Claimants submit that the Noble tribunal simply concluded that it did not have to
determine whether the umbrella clause applied to any breach of any contractual obligation
of the host state’s municipal law or whether ““‘any obligation’, despite its apparent breadth”
is limited in light of the nature and objects of the BIT. It did so because the claimant only
raised the umbrella clause in regard to alleged violations of domestic contractual
commitments. !°4 For the Claimants, regardless of the nature of the GSE Agreements under
Italian law, “they are direct evidence of a binding obligation Italy entered into to pay
specified tariff rates to Claimants’ facilities for twenty years.”!°4 The Claimants’ Italian
law expert confirms that, under Italian law, the nature of the contract (“accessory” or

otherwise) does not affect the binding obligations it imposes on the parties to it.!°4°

The Claimants remind the Tribunal that the GSE Agreements at issue in this case were all
issued in relation to Contos I-IV. These agreements did not contain the language of the
GSE Agreements issued in relation to Conto V, which permitted unilateral modification by
the state. It was the language in the Conto V related GSE Agreements that was the subject
of the constitutional court decision that the Respondent relies on in part for its contention
that all the legal procedures regarding the GSE Agreements, as exclusively regulated by

Italian law, were fully respected. !°*° The Claimants note that all of the GSE Agreements at

issue in this case provided that they were not to be modified without the agreement in

writing of the parties.

Further, the Claimants argue that the GSE Letters also evidence that Italy knew it was
entering into specific obligations with each of the Claimants’ investments. !°*’ Pursuant to
those letters, Italy obliged itself to pay a fixed, constant Conto tariff to each plant for a
specific 20-year period. For example, with respect to Project Ardea, the GSE Letter to the
First Claimant ESPF 2’s subsidiary Victoria Solar S.r.1. states as follows:

we hereby communicate the admission to the incentive tariff under Ministerial

Decree 6 August 2010 [i.e., Conto III], equal to 0.2890 euro/kWh. The incentive

tariff will be recognized for a period of twenty years as of the date of entry into

operation of the plant: 30/05/2011; the tariff is constant, in current currency all
through the 20-year period.!°**

This GSE Letter then required Victoria Solar S.r.1. to execute the GSE Agreement to
activate payment of the tariff as of the date of commissioning.'*? On this basis, the
Claimants claim that the GSE Letters also evidence Italy’s obligation to pay the defined

tariff at a fixed rate for 20 years.

The Claimants argue that the Conto Energia Decrees themselves are another source of the
obligations Italy entered into with respect to the Claimants’ investments. The Claimants
submit that the Conto Energia Decrees contain Italy’s offer to pay eligible PV plants a

defined tariff rate for 20 years, '°°°

and that to accept that offer, the Claimants’ investments
built and commissioned PV plants that met the requirements contained in the Conto
Energia Decrees.!°>! The Claimants contend that their acceptance of Italy’s offer was the

€400 million that they invested into the PV plants at issue.'°°* The Claimants further point

out that there was no discretion for Italy to refuse the Conto tariffs for plants that met the
criteria set forth in the Conto.'° According to the Claimants, Italy’s legislative offer and
the Claimants’ acceptance of that offer constitute a guid pro quo — akin to a contractual
arrangement, which created binding obligations on Italy’s part to pay the promised tariffs
unchanged, for 20 years.!°** The Claimants argue that the GSE Letters and GSE

Agreements formalized the obligations that Italy had already entered into with respect to

each of the Claimants’ plants in its legislation. !°°>

772. The Claimants contend that although the Umbrella Clause does not require reciprocal

obligations on the part the investor or the investment toward the host state in order for the

1056

clause to apply, the Claimants’ investments entered into reciprocal obligations with

Italy in the GSE Agreements. !°%7

773. For example, in the GSE Agreement with the Claimant ICE 5’s investment, Ginosa Energia

S.r.l., which operated the Ginosa project, Article 3 provides that the Claimants’ investment

is required to register on the electronic portal provided by the GSE and must make
use of the proper electronic applications and procedures provided for this purpose.

disputed that the GSE had no discretion to refuse to grant or pay the rates defined in the Conto Energia decrees to

GSE regarding any change related to the plant, the connection to the grid, the
measurement equipment and any additional element necessary for the correct
determination of the incentives mentioned in art. 4 of the present Agreement. !°*

The Claimants contend that the above listed obligations on the part of each of their
Investments was necessary for the Conto Energia program to work as intended.'°*? The
Claimants further assert that the GSE Agreements reflect an implied obligation that the
Claimants’ investments maintain and operate the plant.'°° The Claimants say that this is
because the Conto tariff was only paid on electricity generated and, thus, the plant operator
was required to ensure that the plant was producing electricity in order to receive the tariff

that Italy’s GSE was required to pay. !°°!

The Claimants rely on Greentech v. Italy, in which the majority interpreted ““obligations’
referred to in the ECT’s umbrella clause as sufficiently broad to encompass not only
contractual duties but also certain legislative and regulatory instruments that are specific
enough to qualify as commitments to identifiable investments or investors.”!° The
Claimants observe that “[iJt is quite noteworthy that, in addition to finding a violation of
the FET standard, the Greentech majority also found that Italy violated the ECT’s umbrella

clause,” 103

The Claimants also allege that the changes to the MGP regime were also a breach of the
Umbrella Clause protection in the ECT. The Claimants recall that the Off-Take
Agreements were entered into between the GSE and each plant eligible to participate in
Italy’s Off-Take Regime.'°* The Claimants state that over 300 of the Claimants’ plants
benefitted from the MGP program and held Off-Take Agreements confirming their rights
to do so. The Claimants say that the Off-Take Agreements specifically confirmed the rights
of plants under 1 MW to receive MGPs as established annually in AEEG Resolution

No. 280/2007 for the electricity they sold to the GSE.!° Specifically, the Off-Take
Agreements note that this AEEG Resolution “has defined the modalities and technical-
economic conditions of the energy sale and purchase,” and they expressly confirmed that the
AEEG Resolution fills any gaps in contract terms.'°% Further, the Claimants point out that
Article 4 of the Off-Take Agreements “stated that ‘the prices recognized by the GSE to the
Producer [of the specific PV plant concerned] are established under articles 6 and 7 of AEEG

resolution no. 280/07.7”!0%7

The Claimants contend that Article 7 of AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007 addresses MGPs
specifically by stating that they are to be “paid by the GSE upon request of the relevant
producer at the signing date of the off-take regime agreement and as alternative to the prices
provided for in article 6....”!°°* AEEG Resolution No. 280/2007 further states that “... the
GSE shall recognize the [MGPs] defined by AEEG to the first and second million of kWh
annually produced by a renewable plant under 1 MW, in order to ensure the economic
survival of the smaller plants even in the event the market prices should fall significantly

...1 The Claimants say that this meant that Italy had no room to exercise discretion. !°”

The Claimants recall that the Off-Take Agreements automatically renewed annually, unless
the Producer chose to opt out of the MGP regime.'°”! The Claimants point out that the GSE
did not have the right to terminate the agreement unless the Producer violated certain
eligibility requirements. !°”

In sum, the Claimants say that by entering into Off-Take Agreements in which the GSE
agreed to purchase all of the electricity produced by PV plants under 1 MW at MGPs, Italy

entered into obligations with respect to 341 of the Claimants’ investments.'°”> They assert

that under the Umbrella Clause, Italy was bound to fulfill the contractual obligations
enshrined in the Off-Take Agreements.'°“ The Claimants concede that the Off-Take
Agreements themselves did not refer to specific MGPs that would apply from year to year,
but rather each Agreement expressly incorporated the terms of AEEG Resolution
No. 280/2007, which required the GSE to pay MGPs established at levels significant
enough to “ensure the economic survival of smaller plants even in the event that market
prices should fall significantly.”!°% Thus, the Off-Take Agreements and AEEG Resolution
No. 280/2007 confirmed that plants under 1 MW would receive an MGP each year, which

the Claimants say created an obligation that Italy was required to fulfill.'°”

Alternatively, the Claimants say that the Off-Take Agreements and AEEG Resolution
No. 280/2007 created an obligation for the Respondent to provide MGPs to PV plants
under 1 MW at a meaningful rate; namely an amount sufficient to cover the plants’
operating costs and insulate them from market price fluctuations by being higher than

market price on average. !°””

Similarly, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s imposition of Imbalance Costs and
Administration Fees on its investments breached the obligation with respect to maintaining
fixed tariff rates and not eroding those by taking with one hand what had been given by

another.

or any of their investments “because no agreement has ever been undertaken with any of

them” and the Claimants “never entered into any reciprocal obligation” with Italy.!°”

783. First, the Respondent argues that, upon strict textual analysis, Article 10(1) of the ECT
does not cover statutory obligations or general regulations applicable to any operator
responding to certain qualities. Contrary to the Claimants’ arguments, the Respondent
contends that the relevant case law supports this purported exclusion of statutory and

regulatory acts from the Umbrella Clause. !°°°

784. The Respondent takes issue with the Greentech tribunal’s application of the ECT’s
Umbrella Clause to a statutory measure (the Spalmaincentivi Decree), stating that “to
consider that general measures as the [Conto Energia Decrees] would be obligations
‘entered into’ with individual investors ... very superficially states principles that are
unsupported by any substantial legal analysis or reference to any other awards that could
at least vaguely motivate its statements.”!°*! For the Respondent, the Greentech majority

785. Second, the Respondent asserts that despite Article 10(1) of the ECT covering only
contractual obligations, the GSE Agreements do not fall under the protection of the
Umbrella Clause because they are “merely accessory contracts” required by law.!°*? In the
Respondent’s view, the GSE Agreements are not private law contracts generating
autonomous rights and obligations.'°*4 The Respondent states that the notion of a

transpose legal provisions,” and therefore do not generate contractual obligations under the
Umbrella Clause. '°** For the Respondent, since the GSE Agreements are meant to regulate
the management and distribution of incentives, and they do not add anything relevant to
the legal or regulatory provisions in the Conto Energia Decrees, it follows that only the

Conto Energia Decrees actually determine the legal position of the counter-party.!°*°

The Respondent asserts that neither the Claimants nor any of its Investments ever entered
into any reciprocal obligation with the Italy by way of the GSE Agreements “since no
synallagma [sic] could exist between the tariffs paid and any service or good provided by
the investor.”!°*? The Respondent submits that “[t]ariffs were subsidies given on top of the
price for energy, and were granted also to those investors that were producing for self-
consumption ([i.e.] in the absence of any sale)” and were non-taxable with VAT “because

they did not represent a consideration or anything alike.”!°*

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has found that the Umbrella Clause may, in certain circumstances, protect
obligations created by instruments other than contracts. However, in order for a non-
contractual “obligation entered into” to give rise to treaty protection, it must be a specific
obligation given by the host state to either the investor or its investment. With respect to
timing, a successful claim of breach of the Umbrella Clause requires that there be an
obligation owed to the Investor or the Investment of the Investor at the time that the

Respondent failed to observe that obligation.

As has been discussed above, the Respondent created a regime to attract early and
substantial investment in its PV sector. The main mechanism employed to encourage
investment was the offer of guaranteed FITs for a period of 20 years for those investors

who met the specific criteria set out in the relevant Conto Energia Decree. The offer by the

state was specific in the sense that it set out a very specific tariff rate and criteria. It was
general in the sense that it was made to all potential investors. Once a specific plant met
the criteria and notified Italy, the GSE sent a letter confirming the tariff rate that would
apply to that plant. The plant was then required to access the GSE portal and take the

necessary steps to record the GSE Agreement.

The Claimants in this case accept that Italy had the ability to unilaterally change the offer
in the Conto Energia Decree without engaging liability under the ECT before a prospective
investor made its investment and advised Italy that it had met the criteria. The Claimants
do not challenge the Respondent’s ability to adjust, as it did, the specific tariff rates offered
in successive Conto Energia Decrees. Where the Parties diverge is in their assessment of
whether and when the Respondent undertook an “obligation entered into with the investor

or its investment,” such as to engage the protection afforded by the Umbrella Clause.

The Claimants maintain that the obligations protected by the Umbrella Clause do not
require reciprocal obligations. In any event, the Claimants submit that they did, in fact,
accept reciprocal obligations by meeting the criteria set out in the Conto and making their
investments. Further, Italy confirmed those obligations by letter and then followed up with
the GSE Agreement addressed to each individual plant. The Respondent maintains that it

never entered into any obligations with the Claimants or their investments.

As discussed above, in this case, it is not necessary to consider whether the Conto Energia
regime on its own created obligations. This is because all of the investments at issue in this
case were not only made subject to either Conto II, III or IV, they also each received a
letter confirming their entitlement to the tariffs set out in the legislation and a GSE
Agreement setting out those obligations in the form of a contract, which specifically
provided that changes would not be made without the agreement of the parties. The
Claimants also allege that the GSE Agreements themselves constitute “obligations” entered
into with the Claimants’ investments for the limited purpose of the Umbrella Clause. The
majority finds that the Respondent entered into the obligation to pay the specific tariff rates
set out in the relevant Conto Energia Decree and confirmed in the GSE Letters and GSE

Agreements for a period of 20 years with the Claimants’ investments.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 302

792. The Tribunal observes that the plain language of the ECT does not limit “obligations” to
contractual obligations. The language is broad enough to include statutory and regulatory
assurances made to specific investors, as long as those obligations were “entered into with”
the investor or its investment. The majority finds that the “obligation” to guarantee specific
incentive tariff rates for 20 years arose pursuant to the benefits Italy granted to the
Claimants under all three instruments: the Conto Energia Decrees, the GSE Letters, and
the GSE Agreements, taken as a whole. The majority of the Tribunal agrees with the
Greentech majority that the analysis need not view the GSE Agreements in isolation.'!°?

In any case, the GSE Agreements were clear examples of the obligation entered into with

each of the Claimants’ investments. The Respondent created a regime designed to attract

investment by offering incentive tariffs and then committing to pay those tariffs for

20 years. The system was designed to create specific obligations to each investment by

having them confirmed by letter and then followed up with a GSE Agreement. Having

found that protected obligations could be made by non-contractual instruments, the

Respondent’s arguments as to the nature of the GSE Agreements as accessory contracts

become irrelevant: if legislation is capable of creating obligations, so too would an

accessory contract that gives effect to that legislation. !°°

793. Even if the Tribunal were to decide that the “obligations” must arise from a contract, such
obligations are in fact enshrined in the GSE Agreements. Having found that they constitute
obligations for the purposes of the Umbrella Clause, Italy’s assurances as to the specific
rate and duration (20 years) granted to each of the Claimants’ investments become elevated
to an obligation under international law. This “internationalization” of contractual (and
statutory and regulatory) obligations is what gives the Tribunal jurisdiction to hear the
Claimants’ complaints because they are not party to the GSE Agreements, but the ECT

provides protection to obligations owed to their Investments. Again, it is important to note

1089 Greentech: CL-212, § 466; Claimants’ Comments on New Legal Authorities, 36.
1090 The Tribunal notes that it disagrees with the conclusions reached by the SunReserve tribunal with respect to
whether the Conto Energia Decree language contained sufficient specificity to engage the Umbrella Clause, as well
as whether that legislation was directed at a “small and well-defined class of investors.” The criteria set out in the
Conto Energia regime to qualify for the FIT rates was specific and resulted in those tariffs being committed to a small
and well-defined class of investors: those who met that criteria and connected to the grid by the relevant date.

that the Claimants do not claim for a breach of the GSE Agreements themselves; the claim
is for a breach of the obligation owed to its Investments not to unilaterally modify the

tariffs, which obligation is evidenced clearly by the provisions of the GSE Agreements.

With respect to the MGPs and Offtake Agreements, the situation is somewhat different.
While the MGP regime was set out in the legislation and regulations, the Respondent did
not take on an analogous obligation to maintain the MGPs at a certain level or for a specific
period of time. The Offtake Agreements, unlike the GSE Agreements, specifically
provided for the possibility that the MGPs would change in accordance with the
regulations, which the Respondent did not expressly commit to maintain at any particular
level. In these circumstances, the majority is of the view that the Respondent did not enter
into any obligations with the Claimants or their Investments not to alter the MGP regime

or the benefits accorded in the Offtake Agreements.

Similarly, there is no express obligation that Italy would not allocate system costs
differently than it did at the outset. In order to be protected by the Umbrella Clause, the
obligation entered into must be clear. For the purpose of the Umbrella Clause, it is not
sufficient to allege that a particular measure had the effect of indirectly impacting an
obligation, as the Claimants allege is the case for the imbalance costs and administration
fees, which they say impacted the net tariff rates that they received. Accordingly, the
majority of the Tribunal finds that there was no obligation entered into with the Claimants
or their Investments not to change the allocation of system costs either generally or
specifically. It follows that there was no protection under the Umbrella Clause against the

imposition of imbalance costs and administration fees.
(3) Did the Challenged Measures Breach the Umbrella Clause?
a. The Claimants’ Arguments
(i) Spalmaincentivi Decree

The Claimants’ primary claim under the Umbrella Clause is that the Respondent failed to
observe its obligations to the Claimants to pay the fixed tariff amount for a period of

20 years by enacting the Spalmaincentivi Decree, which abrogated the original tariff

Page 304

scheme granted in the Conto Energia Decrees (and confirmed in the GSE Letters and

Contracts) and imposed reduced tariff rates on the Claimants. !°!

Italy’s Obligation to Pay Fixed Conto Tariffs in the Statutory Framework

797. The Claimants argue that ECT case law is clear that statutory obligations such as those
contained in ministerial decrees and legislation are an “obligation” encompassed by the
Umbrella Clause, and thus the Conto Energia Decrees “are sufficient on their own to

determine Italy’s liability.”!°°?

The Claimants point out that Contos II-IV (which are the
only Conto Energia Decrees applicable to the Claimants’ investments) expressly stated
that “any agreements modifying ... must be agreed upon in writing.” !°°? Only in Conto V
does Italy reserve the GSE’s right to unilaterally modify the clauses of the GSE
Agreements “as a result of any legislative and regulatory amendments [which] are in
contrast with the existing framework.”!°* Since Italy undertook an obligation not to
unilaterally modify the express terms of the Conto Energia Decrees, the Claimants argue
that the Respondent’s characterization of the Spalmaincentivi measure as a reasonable
“fine-tuning” of the incentive tariff regime is irrelevant to the application of the Umbrella

Clause. !°°5

Italy’s Obligation to Pay Fixed Conto Tariffs in the GSE Letters and GSE
Agreements

798. The Claimants argue that, “while unnecessary to a finding of liability,” the GSE Letters
and GSE Agreements “provide two independent, additional bases to determine Italy
violated the ECT’s umbrella clause.”!°*° The Claimants say that, whatever their precise

nature, the GSE Agreements contain binding obligations, which Professor D’Atena’s

testimony confirmed.'°°? The Claimants assert that Italy understood that the GSE
Agreements conveyed rights to investors, as evinced by the following statement by an
Italian official:

the operator admitted to benefit from the incentive tariff acquires a subjective

[perfected] right to the exact performance of the incentive payment promise ... an

incentive law ... becomes a “guarantee” for the private subject carrying out the

incentivized economic activity ... A revocation law, therefore, would be

inconsistent with the constitutionally protected guarantee offered through the
incentive-law. !°%

The Claimants say that, contemporaneously, Italy understood the GSE Agreements to be
typical private law contracts, which is evinced through the express wording of the Romani
Decree: “The incentives are awarded through private-law contracts between the GSE and
the person responsible for the installation.”!° The Claimants contend that there is no
evidence that Italy considered the GSE Agreements differently prior to this arbitration. '!°°
Contrary to the Respondent’s argument that the GSE Agreements were mere accessory
contracts with no legal effect, the Claimants assert that the Agreements were not typical
operations of administrative law, but rather contain features common in private law
contracts, such as references to Articles 1341 and 1342 of Italy’s Civil Code (which are
required in private contracts where one party has more bargaining power as author of the

contract). !!0!

The Claimants contest the Respondent’s reliance on the CEF award,'!” stating that there
is “no way to reconcile” its findings that the GSE Agreements were “private law contracts”
that gave rise to “crystalized rights” with its decision “to absolve Italy of liability under the

ECT’s umbrella clause without impermissibly concluding that subsequent domestic law

characterizations can override the ECT’s umbrella clause at will.”!!°? The Claimants
advance the view that “there was no doubt for the CEF tribunal that the contracts created
valid and binding obligations on Italy and created acquired rights for the claimant’s plants
when they were concluded, which is the point at which the role of domestic law ends in an

umbrella clause analysis.” !!°4

Moreover, the Claimants say that not only is the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision
irrelevant for this Tribunal’s Umbrella Clause assessment, but also that the Court only
considered a GSE Agreement pursuant to Conto V, which contained a “unilateral
modification” clause, which was absent from the Claimants’ GSE Agreements under
Contos II-IV, each of which expressly confirmed that it could only be modified by mutual

agreement of the parties. !!°°

The Claimants also contest the Respondent’s reliance on the 2017 Constitutional Court
Decision — which ruled that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was constitutional — as a defense
against its violations of the GSE Agreements.!!°° The Claimants point out that “Italy’s only
defense is that its umbrella clause violations are based on domestic law characterizations
of its acts as lawful, which are irrelevant under ECT Art. 26(6) and Vienna Convention

Art, 27.7107

The Claimants argue that the CEF tribunal erred in finding that the Spalmaincentivi Decree
did not violate the Umbrella Clause.!!°* The Claimants take issue with that tribunal’s
rejection of the claim on the basis of Italian law — by relying on the 2017 Constitutional
Court Decision’s finding that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was compliant with Italian law

governing law provision of the ECT.”!! The Claimants argue that the CEF tribunal’s
deference to the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision “violates fundamental principles of
international law, including Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (which
states that the characterization of an act as lawful under internal — i.e., domestic — law does
not affect the characterization of that act under international law) and Article 25 of the
VCLT (which states that a party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law to justify

its failure to perform a treaty).”!!!°

(ii) Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s “retroactive” and “unexpected” imposition of
the Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs on the Claimants’ PV facilities (which were
deducted from the Conto incentive tariff) undermined the Respondent’s obligations to pay
PV producers fixed incentive tariff rates for 20 years.'!!! The Claimants assert that these
Challenged Measures are “classic examples of ‘giving with one hand while taking with the
other.’”!''? The Claimants say that these Measures fundamentally changed the economic
framework enshrined in the Conto Energia Decrees, and in the GSE Agreements that
govern each of the Claimants’ PV plants, and thus disregarded the obligations that the

Respondent entered into with respect to the Claimants’ investments. !!!>

(iii) MGP / Off-Take Regime

The Claimants allege that the Respondent failed to observe its legal, regulatory, and

b. The Respondent’s Arguments
(i) Spalmaincentivi Decree

806. The Respondent relies on CEF v. Italy and the dissenting opinion in Greentech v. Italy in
arguing that the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision “finally settled the matter” of the
application of the Umbrella Clause regarding the Spalmaincentivi Decree.'!!® The
Respondent recalls that the Court held that the obligation which Italy entered into with the
Claimants’ investments were, under Italian law, subject to unilateral modification by the
Respondent.'!'’ The Respondent argues that it is a long held principle of Italian law that
“also private law contracts can be modified unilaterally by the State.”'!'® That said, the
Respondent appears to maintain its assertion that the Umbrella Clause cannot apply

because the GSE Agreements were accessory contracts. !!!°

The Claimants Have Not Proved Any Infringement of Contractual Obligations

807. The Respondent contends that the Claimants have not proved any infringement of
contractual obligations because they do not allege a direct violation by the GSE and the
observance of contractual obligations is for the parties to the contract, not for third parties

such as the Claimants. !!?°

The Respondent further argues that the Tribunal should consider the entirety of the
Respondent’s conduct in assessing whether the Umbrella Clause was violated. The
Respondent says that the Tribunal should consider not only the Spalmaincentivi Decree,
but also the Salva Alcoa Decree (which the Claimants say benefited PV investors) in

assessing the Respondent’s fulfilment of the Umbrella Clause regarding fixed tariff

rates,''*' which it says lies at the heart of the Claimants’ Umbrella Clause claim.

(ii) Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs

The Respondent does not provide separate arguments against the Claimants’ Umbrella
Clause claim regarding the Administration Fees and Imbalance Costs. However, the
Respondent does appear to rely on the CEF award’s recognition that the Umbrella Clause

neither applies to any of the Challenged Measures, nor to the GSE Agreements.!!

(iii) MGP / Off-Take Regime
The Respondent does not provide separate arguments against the Claimants’ Umbrella

Clause claim regarding the MGP.

ec. The Tribunal’s Analysis
(i) Spalmaincentivi Decree

The majority of the Tribunal has found that it is appropriate in this case to consider the
Conto Energia Decrees, GSE Letters and GSE Agreements together in assessing whether
the Respondent had entered into any obligations with the investors or their investments. In
so doing, it is clear that the Respondent entered into obligations with the Investor or its
Investments that it would pay the incentive tariff rates for a period of 20 years and not alter
that obligation unilaterally. Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal finds that Italy’s
violation of the guarantees under the legislative framework in the Conto Energia regime

through the enactment of the Spalmaincentivi Decree violated its obligations to the

Award
Page 310

Claimants’ Investments. The majority therefore finds that this measure also breached the

Umbrella Clause.

In so ruling, the majority of the Tribunal has considered whether the provisions of the
Conto Energia Decrees — the terms of which the majority has already found, above, were
confirmed to each of the Claimants’ Investments by the GSE Letters and GSE Agreements

— constitute “obligations” “entered into” between the Claimants as foreign investors, with
respect to their Investments, such that abrogation of the guarantees set forth in the Conto

Energia Decrees and GSE Agreements violated the ECT.

Italy entered into specific obligations with foreign investors, such as the Claimants, by
enacting the Conto Energia Decrees, and by confirming the guarantees therein in the GSE
Letters and GSE Agreements with each individual qualifying PV plant. The specific
incentive tariff rate promised for 20 years under Contos II-IV, for which the Claimants’
Investments qualified, became obligations within the meaning of Article 10(1) of the ECT
once the investors or their investments met the criteria in the relevant Conto Energia
Decree and advised Italy. The Respondent then confirmed its obligation with respect to the

specific plant(s) through a GSE Letter and GSE Agreement addressed to the Investment.

The majority of the Tribunal finds that the Conto Energia Decrees themselves set out the
basis for the Respondent’s obligations, but that these were conditional upon the criteria
being met by the specific plant and notified to the Respondent by the Investment. At that
stage of the process, there was a specific identifiable obligation entered into with respect

to a specific investment.

The Conto Energia Decrees contain Italy’s offer to pay eligible PV plants a defined tariff
rate for 20 years. The Claimants’ Investments accepted that offer by building and
commissioning PV plants that met the requirements contained in the Conto Energia
Decrees. The majority of the Tribunal thus agrees with the Claimants that their acceptance
of Italy’s offer was their investment in the PV plants which all qualified for Contos I-IV.
This obligation is further evidenced by the inability of Italy to refuse the Conto tariffs for

plants that met the criteria set forth in the Conto. Italy’s legislative offer and the Claimants’

816.

817.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 311

acceptance of that offer thus constitute a guid pro quo akin to a contractual arrangement to
pay the promised tariffs, unchanged, for 20 years. The GSE Letters and, more so, the GSE
Agreements formalized the obligations that Italy had already entered into with respect to

each of the Claimants’ plants.

That said, the majority of the Tribunal finds that by entering into the GSE Agreement, the
Respondent also entered into contractual obligations with each of the Italian companies
that own the Claimants’ Investments (namely, their 341 PV plants at issue).''?+ The
majority agrees with the Claimants that, under the Umbrella Clause, the Respondent is
therefore bound to fulfil the obligations enshrined in each GSE Agreement, which
promised to pay a fixed tariff at a constant rate for a 20 year period.!!> Italy was, or ought
to have been, aware that it was entering into obligations with investments. It was also aware
of the identity of the investments and the fact that many of these were represented by

foreign nationals. !!6

Just as the Umbrella Clause does not require an obligation to be in the form of a negotiated
agreement to give rise to Umbrella Clause protection, there is no requirement that the
obligation be in the nature of a private law agreement. In fact, the classification of the
obligation under the law of the host state is irrelevant in interpreting the meaning
“obligation” at international law. In any event, the Claimants’ Italian law expert confirmed
that even at Italian law the GSE Agreements created binding obligations regardless of their
character. The majority of the Tribunal notes that any other interpretation of obligation
would undermine the object and purpose of the ECT, as it would allow states to avoid
international law obligations by classifying those as non-binding at local law. The majority
finds that the GSE Agreements were obligations entered into with the Investments such as
to give rise to protection under the Umbrella Clause. The Claimants, as the Investors, are

entitled to bring a claim under the Umbrella Clause for breach of obligations entered into

with their Investments. The exclusive jurisdiction clause in the GSE Agreements does not

apply to claims for a breach of the ECT.

For the avoidance of doubt, the majority has specifically considered Italy’s defense that the
Spalmaincentivi Decree and its consequent modifications of the GSE Agreements were
consistent with Italian law. With respect to the Umbrella Clause claim, Italy made this
argument generally in its pre-hearing submissions in support of its primary position that
legislative enactments and by extension, accessory contracts that give effect to those
enactments, cannot be the source of “autonomous” obligations entered into with an investor
for the purposes of the Umbrella Clause. Italy relied on long-standing Italian law principles

that allow the state to unilaterally modify accessory contracts,
confirmed by the 2017 Constitutional Court decision.'!?* The definition of “obligations
entered into” arises from the Tribunal’s interpretation of the ECT. The majority has
rejected Italy’s position that such obligations can never arise from legislation or regulation
and instead the protection only relates to private law contracts. Further, the majority has
found that in this case Italy did enter into obligations with the Investors’ Investments for
the purposes of the Umbrella Clause. In accordance with Article 25 of the VCLT, it would
be inappropriate for this Tribunal to give effect to Italy’s defense that its measures were in
accordance with its national law and, ergo, did not breach the ECT. The Tribunal must

consider Italy’s measures against the international law obligations contained in the ECT.

Also for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal has specifically considered Italy’s expanded
arguments in defense of the Umbrella Clause claim based on other tribunal decisions,
which were submitted as comments to those additional awards following the conclusion of
the hearing. The Claimants were also afforded the opportunity to comment on those
decisions. The Tribunal has already expressed its concern in applying the decisions of other
tribunals decided in the context of different investors and facts to matters submitted and
argued in this case. However, in light of the extensive submissions made by the Parties, the

Tribunal will briefly address the decisions in CEF v. Italy and Greentech v. Italy, which

were relied upon by the Parties for certain positions taken for the purposes of the Umbrella

Clause claims.

The CEF tribunal in that case accepted Italy’s position that only contractual obligations
can give rise to claims for breach of the Umbrella Clause. Although the CEF v. Italy
tribunal found that the GSE Agreements were “private law contracts” that gave rise to
“crystallized rights,” the tribunal ultimately dismissed the claimants’ umbrella clause claim
in part because of subsequent domestic law characterizations of those Agreements as
“merely accessory” by the 2017 Constitutional Court Decision regarding the validity of the
Spalmaincentivi Decree under Italian law.''?? As this Tribunal has reached a different
conclusion as to the potential sources of obligations entered into with Investors or their
Investments for the purposes of the Umbrella Clause, the CEF v. /taly tribunal’s analysis

of the character of the GSE Agreements is irrelevant to this Tribunal’s determination.

The Greentech majority held that “obligations” as used in the Umbrella Clause is
“sufficiently broad to encompass not only contractual duties but also certain legislative and
regulatory instruments that are specific enough to qualify as commitments to identifiable
investments or investors.”!!°° Similar to this Tribunal’s finding, it went on to find that
“taken as a whole, the Conto Energia Decrees, the GSE letters, and the GSE Agreements,
amounted to obligations ‘entered into with’ specific PV operators” and that “each of

Claimants’ investments received benefits pursuant to all three types of ‘obligations.””!'?!

The dissenting opinion in Greentech v. Italy, upon which the Respondent relies, disagrees
with this finding of the majority and expresses the view that only contractual obligations
are protected by the Umbrella Clause. In advocating the approach of evaluating each
obligation separately and, in particular, the GSE Agreements as the source of the
obligation, Professor Sacerdoti suggests that the decision of the Italian Constitutional Court

that assesses the validity of Italy’s measures should be given weight in determining whether

there was a breach of those contractual obligations at Italian law, as the governing law of

those contracts.

The Tribunal disagrees with the proposition that only contractual obligations are protected
by the Umbrella Clause. The majority of the Tribunal having found that obligations can be
entered into with the Investor or its Investment by sufficiently specific legislation or
regulations and that the obligation can be evidenced through multiple instruments, the
national law assessment of whether the measures breached obligations is not of primary
importance, as it cannot override international law obligations. In any event, even if the
Tribunal were to consider the findings of the Constitutional Court, the Claimants rightly
point out that the circumstances considered by the Constitutional Court are different than
those of this case. Specifically, in arriving at its assessment of whether the state breached
the GSE Agreements, the Court only considered the language of a GSE Agreement
pursuant to Conto V, which contained a “unilateral modification” clause absent from the
Claimants’ GSE Agreements under Contos II-IV. In the context of this case, the relevant
GSE Agreements each expressly confirmed that it could only be modified by mutual

agreement of the parties. !!7?

Accordingly, in light of this Tribunal’s findings, it does not consider it appropriate to apply
the reasoning of either the Greentech or CEF tribunals to its analysis and it finds the
2017 Constitutional Court decision of limited assistance.

(ii) Administration Fee and Imbalance Costs
As the Tribunal has found that there was no obligation owed by the Respondent to the
Claimants or their investments with respect to the imposition of fees, it follows that these
measures were not breaches of the Umbrella Clause.

(iii) MGP / Off-Take Regime

As the Tribunal also has found that there was no obligation owed by the Respondent to the

Claimants or their investments with respect to the minimum guaranteed prices or the

offtake regime, it follows that the measures relating to this regime were not breaches of the

Umbrella Clause.

(4) Conclusion on Umbrella Clause

The Spalmaincentivi Decree breached the Umbrella Clause protection owed to the
Claimants. The other measures did not address obligations entered into with the Claimants

or their Investments pursuant to the meaning of those terms in the Umbrella Clause.

As the majority of the Tribunal also found that the Spalmaincentivi Decree breached the
Respondent’s FET obligations under the ECT and the damages claimed for each of the
alleged breaches is the same, no additional consequences flow from a finding that this
decree also breached the Umbrella Clause. Arbitrator L. Boisson de Chazournes does
not consider that the words “entered into with” in the last sentence of Article 10(1) of the
ECT have been given their proper ordinary meaning in light of the customary principles of
international law applicable to the interpretation of treaties. These terms do not allow to
consider the applicable Italian regulation in the present case which was not specifically
designed for foreign investors, as an obligation that Italy allegedly “entered into with” the
investors. Even assuming that the GSE Agreements are covered by the umbrella clause, the
scope of the rights therein does not go beyond that of the regulatory regime on which they
were based. Therefore, Arbitrator L. Boisson de Chazournes is not able to subscribe to the

majority’s approach regarding the finding of a breach of the umbrella clause in this case.

CONCLUSIONS ON LIABILITY

For the reasons stated above, the majority of the Tribunal has concluded that the
Spalmaincentivi Decree breached the Respondent’s obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment pursuant to Article 10 of the ECT and that it also breached the Impairment Clause

and the Umbrella Clause.

The Tribunal has concluded that none of the other Challenged Measures amounted to a

breach of the ECT.

In the next section, the Tribunal will address the Claimants’ claim for damages flowing

from the breaches that have been established.
DAMAGES (ISSUE 5)

In light of the Tribunal’s findings on liability, only the Claimants’ claim for damages
flowing from the Spalmaincentivi Decree will be considered in the following sections of
this award. The majority of the Tribunal has found that the Spalmaincentivi Decree
breached both the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment and the Umbrella
Clause in reducing the amounts of the feed in tariffs. However, the damages claimed flow
from the Decree and its impact on the valuation of the Investments regardless of which
provision of the ECT it was found to breach. In other words, no additional damages are
claimed because a measure breached multiple provisions of the ECT. The Claimants’
damages submissions provided a separate analysis of the alleged impact of each of the
Challenged Measures on the value of their investments. Accordingly, it is possible for the
Tribunal to assess the damages claim for the Spalmaincentivi Decree separate from the
other Challenged Measures, which were not found to have breached the ECT. In light of
her views on the liability issues as expressed in paras. 645, 709 and 829, Arbitrator L.
Boisson de Chazournes does not concur with the quantum and interest sections as decided
by the majority of the Tribunal. Therefore, the reference to the “Tribunal’s Analysis” in

Parts XII and XIII of the Award should be read as referring to the majority.

The Parties disagreed as to both the correct legal standard that applies to the assessment of
damages in this case, as well as whether the Claimants’ Investments suffered any damage
at all as a result of the measures and, if so, the quantification of those damages. In the
following sections of the Award, the legal standard will be discussed first before turning to
the Respondent’s specific issues with the Claimants’ assessment of and their expert’s
quantification of damage. Finally, the Tribunal will assess the quantum of the damages

proved.

APPLICABLE COMPENSATION STANDARD (ISSUE 5.1)

The Claimants submit that, in the event that they are successful on any of their claims for
breach of the ECT, they are entitled to full compensation for the impact of those breaches

on the value of their Investments.

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal has broad discretion to award something other
than full compensation, as it can weigh the purpose of the measures against the impact on

the Claimants’ investments.

The Parties agree that the ECT, the /ex specialis in this case, does not contain any applicable
guidance as to the compensation due in these circumstances. While Article 13 of the ECT
outlines the conditions that the Respondent must satisfy in order to lawfully expropriate
investments, the Claimants do not claim that their investments were expropriated. Further,
the Claimants’ success on their claims related to the Spalmaincentivi Decree means that
they have established that this measure was illegal. Accordingly, both Parties submit that
the ECT does not set out an applicable standard for compensation and that the Tribunal

must look to customary international law principles.

qd) The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants say that customary international law provides for the full compensation

standard, as articulated in the following passage in Chorzow Factory:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act — a principle
which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the
decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-
out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.
Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to
the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, ifneed be, of damages
for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment
in place of it-such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount
of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.!!°

838. The Claimants state that numerous tribunals have applied the full compensation standard
to investment treaty violations such as FET and other standards, including the tribunals in
Amoco v. Iran, MTD v. Chile, AAPL v. Sri Lanka, Vivendi v. Argentina, and Azurix v.
Argentina.''** The Claimants note that the Vivendi v. Argentina tribunal stated that “it is
generally accepted today that, regardless of the type of investment, and regardless of the
nature of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages awarded in international

investment arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to compensate the affected party fully

and to eliminate the consequences of the state’s action.”!!?°

839. The Claimants submit that the regulatory and public purpose nature of the Challenged
Measures and the absence of fraudulent intent are not factors that this Tribunal should
consider in assessing damages.'!*° In any event, the Claimants argue that on the facts of
this case, the general regulatory character of the Challenged Measures or the Respondent’s
position that they were in furtherance of legitimate public policy goals do not excuse Italy’s
conduct under the applicable substantive legal standards engaged by the ECT and
international law.''>7 In short, the Claimants argue that once the Tribunal has found that
the Challenged Measures breached the ECT, the aim of the damages assessment is to
provide full reparation for those acts. The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s approach

amounts to rearguing the case on liability in the context of the quantification of

damages. !!38

840. The Claimants assert that the same principles espoused in unlawful expropriation cases
govern the determination of damages in cases involving FET and other investment
protection treaty standards.''*? In particular, the Claimants dispute the Respondent’s
contention that in cases of impairment by non-expropriatory violations, the principle of full

compensation does not apply.!!#°

841. The Claimants also contest the Respondent’s suggestion that the Tribunal award no
damages because the impact of its illegal measures on the Claimants’ investments “was
something less than total destruction.”!'4! The Claimants rely on Vivendi v. Argentina for
the principle that, in the event of partial impairment of the investment, full compensation
will be based on the amount of impairment in the value of the investment caused by the
state’s violation.''*” Therefore, the Claimants say that the degree of harm caused has no

bearing on the application of the full compensation principle.

842. The Claimants agree that the Tribunal has discretion in calculating the amount needed to
provide full compensation for the losses suffered, including assessing the reasonableness
of the various assumptions embedded in the Parties’ quantum calculations and considering
whether any of the damages claimed were caused by events independent of the illegal
measures. ''*3 However, the Claimants strongly refute the Respondent’s position that “the
Tribunal can or should reduce its award of damages below full compensation based on

supposed ‘equities,’ unmoored to any legal principle or standard, that supposedly justified

[the Respondent’s] illegal behavior.” !'4+

by the Respondent’s submissions, they do not request the full fair market value of their
Investments as damages.!!'4° The Claimants’ experts calculated the individual impact of

each of the Challenged Measures on the fair market value of the Investments.

In response to Respondent’s argument that the Salva Alcoa Decree should be taken into
account in assessing damages, the Claimants maintain that it has no legal relevance and no
impact on the Claimants’ treaty claims or on quantum.!'#° The Claimants assert that they
knew that Italy might change tariff rates for future plants before some of the Claimants’
plants were constructed and connected to the grid, since Italy did precisely that when it
enacted Contos II, III, and IV.''47 The Claimants submit that they worked to manage the
risk that the tariff might change during the development and pre-connection stage, and do
not claim that Italy violated the ECT for any of those “pre-commissioning” changes. ''*8

The Claimants contend that the Salva Alcoa Decree was a change to the regime that Italy
made for the benefit of the grid authorities responsible for connecting completed PV plants
to the grid within specified deadlines.'!*? It was not adopted for the benefit of the
Claimants. The Claimants point out that the Salva Alcoa Decree did not alter the Claimants’
obligation to complete plant construction by the original deadline of December 2010 and

that the Claimants met those obligations.!!*°

The Claimants further argue that the Sa/va Alcoa Decree did not affect the incentive tariffs

(2) The Respondent’s Arguments

847. The Respondent argues that the Claimants are not entitled to full compensation in the
circumstances of this case. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should consider the
Respondent’s defenses — the general and regulatory nature of the measures, the absence of
fraudulent intent, and the measures’ public purpose — and reduce the amount of any

compensation owed to the Claimants accordingly.!!**

848. In support of its position, the Respondent provides a different interpretation of the passage
from Chorzéw Factory quoted at paragraph 838, above. It agrees that “the rationale of
damages is to wipe out the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the original
situation,” but goes on to note that the tribunal “mitigated” this standard by using the
expression “as far as possible,” which it submits confirms that “the correspondence
between damages and compensation” is of a “probabilistic” nature.''** Second, the
Respondent argues that this passage “refers more to the kind of measure to compensate

(restitution versus compensation), than to the actual quantification of damages.” !!°°

849. Based on this interpretation and its interpretation of other cases, the Respondent argues that
tribunals have discretion in determining their approach to damages in cases that do not
involve expropriation.'!*’ The Respondent contends that the only non-expropriation case
cited by the Claimants in support of their full compensation argument is AAPL v. Sri Lanka,

which concerned the obligation to provide full protection and security.!!°* However, the

Respondent argues that the damages in that case were comparable to those of an
expropriation because the investor was deprived of the entirety of its investment due to a
complete destruction of the value of the investment.!!*? In this regard, the Respondent also
contests the Claimants’ reliance on Vivendi v. Argentina for the principle of full
compensation, noting that the tribunal in that case specifically stated that

the level of damages necessary to compensate for a breach of the [FET] standard

could be different from a case where the same government expropriates the

foreign investment. The difference will generally turn on whether the investment
has merely been impaired or destroyed.!!

The Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ investments were not destroyed. To the
contrary, the Respondent submits that they “are still functioning and (highly) profitable,”

and thus damages should be reduced accordingly.!'*!

In the Respondent’s view, for non-expropriatory treaty breaches, a tribunal must balance

and “equitably reduce”!!°

the purported damages to the investor with the state’s reasons
for adopting the measures.!!° The Respondent relies on the tribunal’s decision in CMS v.
Argentina, which noted in the course of its reasons that the consequences stemming from
the financial crisis ought to be considered by the tribunal when determining compensation,

as business could not have continued as usual in those circumstances. !!+

For the Respondent, it follows that, if the Tribunal agrees that the Spalmaincentivi Decree
was enacted for a legitimate public purpose, the Tribunal should not consider the fair
market value of the Claimants’ investments in assessing the quantum of damages.''® The
Respondent argues that its “regulatory intervention was proportionate to the goal because

Miraglia of the GSE, which states that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was a fine-tuning of the
regulatory regime that only resulted in about a two percent reduction in the incentives paid

to the Claimants.

853. The Respondent says that the Claimants’ profit expectations at the time they invested were

exceeded by their better performance, and that alleged “extra profits”!!®7

made by the
Claimants’ investments reduced the impact of the Challenged Measures, thus lowering the
quantum of damages.''®* The Respondent’s experts, GRIF, explained that “extra profits ...
are profits which are above normal level,” namely that they are “higher than the level

associated to an analogous financial activity.”!!°

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

854. In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants having proved that the
Spalmaincentivi Decree breached the provisions of the ECT, they are entitled to be fully

compensated for the impact of this measure on their Investments.

855. The standard of full compensation articulated in the Chorzow Factory Judgment of 13
September 1928 requires the Tribunal to determine what compensation is necessary in
order to “as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed.” The standard is clear; the goal of the exercise is to compensate the Claimants
in a way that wipes out the consequences of the illegal act. While in Chorzéw Factory,
there were a number of options discussed by the tribunal, including restitution in kind, it
was clear that the overall aim was to restore the wronged party to the financial situation it

would have been in but for the Respondent’s wrongful act. It is not possible in most cases

1169 Hearing Transcript, Day 4, 819:2-12: “From an economic point of view, extra profits are profits which are

alternative use of that input in another, for instance, sector.” See also Hearing Transcript, Day 4, 820:1-3.

Page 324

to unwind the clock and put the wronged party back into the situation it was in before the
wrongful acts. Thus, in order to wipe out the consequences, this analysis necessarily can

only be done “as far as possible.” It is impossible to know the exact situation that would

 

have existed if the wrongful act had not been committed. Therefore, the analysis is focused
on re-establishing the situation that would have existed “in all probability.” It also requires
a holistic analysis. The first step provides for restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent

and the second for damages for losses sustained but not covered by restitution.

The Tribunal disagrees that this approach entitles it to consider “the general and regulatory
character of Italian measures, the absence of any fraudulent intent whatsoever, the
fundamental public purpose characterizing each of the measures and therefore equitably
reduce the amount of compensation (if any) from the full value of damages,”!!”° as
submitted by the Respondent. Having found that the Spalmaincentivi Decree was unlawful,
the Tribunal must determine what measure of damages would wipe out the consequences
of this measure for the Claimants. To the extent that the Respondent’s arguments regarding
the purpose of the Challenged Measures are relevant, they have already been considered

by the Tribunal in reaching its decision on liability.

The cases cited by the Respondent in support of its position that these considerations are
relevant to damages were decided in the context of the Argentine financial crisis. The
tribunals in those cases recognized that while the measures caused some of the claimants’
losses, the financial crisis affected the entire economy and it was difficult to determine
which losses were attributable to the measures and which would have been suffered in any
event. This did not amount to a reduction of damages on equitable grounds. It was an
attempt to assess what situation the claimants would have been in “in all probability” absent
the measures, but taking into account the existence of the financial crisis, which was the
impetus for the measures. The tribunals in those cases were still looking to award full
compensation to the claimants, but only for the losses caused by the measures and not the

crisis more generally.

In this case, the Respondent has not argued that the damages claimed are not attributable
to the measures or that they would have been suffered in any event. The Tribunal
understands the Respondent’s position to be that since the measures did not completely
wipe out the value of the Claimants’ Investments and, in fact, the Investments continued
to be profitable after the measures, which were passed for a public purpose, the Tribunal
should award the Claimants something less than full compensation. This is contrary to the
fundamental customary international law principle of full compensation for wrongful acts.
The Tribunal’s discretion in estimating the amount of damages needed to provide full
compensation does not extend to awarding damages that amount to less than full

compensation.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will review carefully the Claimants’ claims for damages flowing
from the Spalmaincentivi Decree in light of the circumstances surrounding the measures in
order to ensure that any damages awarded provide full compensation, but no less nor more

than full compensation, to the Claimants.

METHODS OF VALUATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF DAMAGES (ISSUE 5.2)

The Claimants claim damages for two different aspects of the Spalmaincentivi Decree, the
incentive tariff reduction itself (the “IT Decrease”) and the impact in the change to the
payment terms of the tariffs (“IT Payment Term Change”). Since the Tribunal found that
the IT Payment Term Change, unlike the IT Decrease, was not a breach of the ECT, this
aspect of the Claimants’ claim for damages will not be considered further.!!’! The
Claimants’ expert, FTI, quantified the effect of these measures by performing a valuation
of the Claimants’ Investments before and after the IT Decrease. The Claimants claim the
diminution in the fair market value of their Investments as calculated by FTI as the damages

flowing from the IT Decrease.

The valuation methodology employed by FTI was a discounted cash flow (“DCF”)
analysis. The DCF method values an investment based on future cash flows that the

investment is expected to generate, “discounted” to a present value to account for the time

value of money and risk of the forecasted cash flows.!!’? FTI compared the value of the
Investments based on the future cash flows expected under the tariffs before the measures
(the “Counterfactual Position”) to the value of the Investments based on the cash flows
following the IT Decrease (the “Actual Position”).!'”> FTI values the Claimants’ shares in
and shareholder loans made to the companies that own the PV plants in Italy.!!’4 FTI
calculates the combined effect of the Spalmaincentivi Decree on all of the Claimants’
Investments to be €17.5 million at the Valuation Date, €16 million of which relates to the

IT Decrease.

The Respondent challenges the basis of the Claimants’ claim for damages. It argues that
fair market value is not an appropriate measure of damages in cases where an investor’s
investments remain intact and profitable. The Respondent urges the Tribunal to consider
all of the circumstances surrounding the PV investments rather than employ strict income-
based methods such as DCF, which it says would result in “excessive remuneration of the
invested capital” and unjust enrichment of the Claimants.'!’> Further, the Respondent says
that the method that the Claimants have used to calculate fair market value and quantify
damages — the DCF method — is inappropriate. These objections to the Claimants’
methodology will be considered in the following section of the Award before turning to

the issues of quantum of damages.

qd) The Claimants’ Arguments

As noted, the Claimants claim for the diminution in the fair market value of their
Investments related to the IT Decrease. The Claimants are investment funds. The
Claimants’ investments consist of shareholdings in the PV facilities that operate in Italy.
In the claim for damages, the Claimants’ expert, FTI, has determined the fair market value
of each of the investments individually before each of the Challenged Measures and also

determined the fair market value of each of the investments individually at 1 January 2015,

which is the date that the last of these measures took effect, in order to calculate the

damages suffered by the Claimants.

FTI used the DCF method to perform this analysis, which allowed it to separately quantify
the impact of each of the Challenged Measures on the fair market value of the investments.
The Claimants submit that a DCF analysis is the most appropriate method for calculating
their losses in this case and that the appropriate date for the assessment of damages is
1 January 2015, as this was the effective date of the final measure that the Claimants
challenge, the reduction in the incentive tariffs guaranteed by the Conto Energia
regime.'!”° The Claimants instructed their expert to use 1 January 2015 as the valuation

date (the “Valuation Date”).

In the Claimants’ view, the legal standard for determining the quantum of compensation is
the same for each Claimant and each Investment regardless of when acquisition
occurred.!!77 As discussed above, the Claimants assert that the proper legal standard for
quantum is to “as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed.”!'’8 The Claimants assert that they acquired all of their Investments before any
of the Challenged Measures took effect (or had even been announced), and thus the date of

acquisition is irrelevant to quantum. !!7?

The Claimants say that the DCF method is appropriate for this case because the
performance of solar PV plants is relatively predictable. In particular, they note that they
can sell all of the electricity they produce at prices and costs that are known or can be
forecast with a high degree of confidence for a significant period of time.!'!*® FTI’s

Mr. Edwards testified that other valuation approaches — such as the relative valuation,

cost-based valuation, and asset-based valuation — are unlikely to lead to an accurate

assessment of loss in the circumstances of the case. ''*!

FTI’s Mr. Edwards testified that the advantages of the DCF method include that it
quantifies the impact of individual regulatory changes explicitly and accurately, and that
specific characteristics and performance such as capacity, tariff and cost structure of the
Claimants’ plants are properly reflected in the valuations. !'*? Mr. Edwards described three
principal reasons why the DCF method is the most appropriate way to assess quantum in

this case.

First, demand is guaranteed by the right to priority offtake; market revenue, operating costs
and inflation are the same in both the Counterfactual and Actual Positions; and the only
material variables in the DCF calculation are electricity production and the Weighted
Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”).!!®? The financial performance of PV assets, once in
operation, are highly predictable, particularly when they operate pursuant to a regulatory
regime such as the one set out in the Conto Energia regime.''* In particular, electricity

production is highly predictable.'!*

Therefore, the cashflows of the Claimants’
Investments are predictable because they do not have to compete in order to sell electricity,
since they have priority dispatch and the price at which they sell electricity, and the costs

they incur is largely known in advance through long-term maintenance contracts. !!8°

FTI suggests that the Respondent’s expert, GRIF, concedes the predictability point when
it states that investments in renewable energy in Italy are very low risk, and equates returns

to that of government bonds.!'*” FTI asserts that GRIF’s likening of the Conto Energia

regime to government bonds “implies a very high degree of predictability of returns” and

thus supports the use of the DCF method for valuing PV plants.!!**

Second, Mr. Edwards testified that by carefully analysing each of the Claimants’ PV plant’s
cashflows, he could specifically quantify the impact on value of individual measures,

which no other evaluation method allows.!!8°

Third, Mr. Edwards stated that the DCF method is commonly used by lenders, investors
and third-party valuation advisors in the PV market — not just by experts in litigation — as
the “primary, and often the only, method used to value PV plants.”!!°° Mr. Edwards pointed
out that the Respondent’s experts, GRIF, and Mr. Miraglia of GSE both used some form
of DCF method in their reports.!!°! Mr. Miraglia approached the task of forecasting the
Claimants’ plants’ incentive tariff revenues independently. Mr. Edwards notes that despite
slight differences in his approach relating to the assumptions as to degradation of assets
compared to FTI’s, his calculation of the expected financial performance of the plants was

very similar to FTI’s.!!°

The Claimants also point out that in Ziser v. Spain, a similar case to the present one in that
it involved the assessment of damages for changes in a PV tariff regime, Spain’s argument
that the DCF method was not suitable for valuing damages was rejected by the tribunal as
“unwarranted.”!!%> The tribunal in that case observed that the DCF method had frequently
been applied as an appropriate and effective means for arriving at a valuation of a business

operating as a going concern prior to adverse government actions. !!°4

FTI calculates that the Spalmaincentivi Decree reduced the value of the Claimants’
investments (determined to be €351.1 million in the aggregate before any of the

measures)!!°> by €17.5 million or 7.5%.

(2) The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent contends that the use of fair market value calculated by means of a DCF
analysis is not an appropriate means to calculate compensation in this case, and that the

Claimants do not provide sufficiently specific arguments in support of their claims.!!°°

As an initial matter, the Respondent submits that fair market value is only appropriate in
cases of expropriation or other treaty breaches that result in a near total destruction of the
value of the investment. According to the Respondent, a fair market value analysis is aimed
at calculating the value of an investment at a given time, rather than the damages

“concretely” suffered by the investor, and is thus typical of damages for expropriation.!!*”

In this case, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not suffered “effective
damage” because their PV plants remain “fully operational and profitable.”!'°* On this
basis, the Respondent asserts that its proposed method of assessing damages is correct. The
Respondent’s experts provide an analysis of “the original economic expectations of
Claimants for the remuneration of [their] investment through the [FIT] regime, as
compared with the effective remuneration of such regime.”!!°? The Respondent, through
its expert, GRIF, contends that this approach is appropriate in a highly regulated sector like
the one at issue here, as investors should have expected that the state would fine tune the

feed in tariff rates to reflect the decreasing costs and any variance in production levels.

In response to Claimants’ methodology, the Respondent asserts that a “concrete calculation
of compensation should avoid determining an amount resulting into an excessive

remuneration of the invested capital, as it would be, from a general point of view, by

utilizing income-based methods, such as the DCF.”'?° Further, the Respondent says that
the DCF method is highly speculative and therefore not appropriate to quantify

damages. '20!

Further, the Respondent urges the Tribunal to consider all of the circumstances, including
the positive impact of the Salva Alcoa Decree on the Claimants’ investments and the timing

of the acquisition of various plants when assessing any damages in this case.

The Respondent characterizes the Salva Alcoa Decree as an “unexpected benefit” that it
conferred on PV investors, allowing them a longer period of time to gain the higher
Conto II tariffs, rather than the Conto III tariffs that would have otherwise applied. Mr.
Miraglia calculates the positive impact of the Salva Alcoa Decree on the Claimants’

investments to be €10.7 million. !7°

The Respondent argues that, “following the strict logic of the Claimants, the adoption of
the Salva-Alcoa was unforeseeable by the investors at the time of making the investment,
since this was a measure undertaken as an immediate response to the huge amount of
investments made in those years that had generated a deadlock in connection to the
grid.”!?°? The Respondent contends that if the Spalmaincentivi Decree is considered to
have retroactive effects because, at the time of making the investment, the producer could
not have known it would have been adopted, then the same reasoning has to apply in the
case of the Salva Alcoa Decree. Accordingly, the Claimants received an unexpected benefit
from the application of the Salva Alcoa Decree, which should be deducted from any

changes assessed by the Tribunal.

With respect to the timing of the acquisition of the investments, the Respondent contends

that there is a “structural difference” between investors that actually undertook the

development and construction of a plant, and those that buy on the secondary market.!7°

For the Respondent, the latter are “less vulnerable,” and thus “do not respond to the logics

that justify the incentives.”!?°

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal’s assessment of damages “should be based on the
price of the acquisition and after an assessment of weather [sic] and to what extent
regulatory risk had been internalised into the negotiated price.” '?°° The Respondent further
contends that “the price was the result of free negotiation and consequently the investor
should bear the whole of the regulatory risk as part of transacting costs in a regulated
market.” !?°7 In the Respondent’s view, in the absence of “adequate due diligence,” the
investor should bear its own damages “and consequently be held at the very least partially
responsible.”!?°° The Respondent asserts that the Claimants “are very sophisticated

investment funds” and thus they should absorb “the regulatory risk inherent in managing a
fund.”12

The Respondent does not propose an alternative means of calculating damages, as its
primary position is that the Claimants have suffered no loss. Instead, the Respondent’s
experts analyse what they say were investors’ economic expectations at the time they made
their investments and compare those to the current circumstances arguing that awarding
any damages would result in “an unjustified enrichment” by awarding a higher return on

invested capital than what it says the Claimants expected. !?!° The Respondent submits that

Now, the scheme was meant to support sunk costs. We all agree. It is also
uncontroversial that at least 80, the Claimants say even 90 per cent of costs are
supported upfront. Is the level of vulnerability the same for someone acquiring a
project close to completion to that sitting duck that makes the development of the
plant? Can the acquirer choose among projects, locations, countries? Can the
acquirer give a price to regulatory risk? Is there really no difference between these
two people in the quality of regulatory risk that they can take? And what is the
responsibility that an administrator of a fund must undertake, faced with its
investors? FTI affirms that all regulatory risk must be borne by the public. We
don’t agree with that. But what do you think on the opposite, that it is the role of
an investment fund, deciding to invest in an almost-ready project, so not getting
into the business of development as for assumption of regulatory risk?

GRIF relies on “economic previsions originally existing at the time of the Claimants’
investment ... calculated according to the estimation model available at [the time the

Investments were made], and not on current available methods,” which it says is the

appropriate time at which to value any losses, and concludes that the Claimants suffered

no losses. !?!!

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s objections to the use of an analysis that
compares the fair market value of the Investments before and after the measures to assess
the Claimants’ losses in this case. Since the Claimants’ Investments consist of
shareholdings, an analysis that seeks to determine the impact on the value of those
shareholdings as a result of the measures is entirely appropriate. As for Respondent’s
position that it is only appropriate to consider fair market value in the event of expropriation
or other measures that result in a near total deprivation of an investment, this objection
could be relevant if the Claimants were seeking the entire fair market value of their
investments as a result of the breaches. However, that is not the Claimants’ damages claim.
The Claimants seek only the diminution of the value of their investments measured by
comparing the fair market value of those investments before and after the measures. To the
extent that the Claimants can establish that the illegal measures are the cause of a
diminution in the fair market value of their investments, this method is an entirely

appropriate one to use in the circumstances of this case.

In order to calculate the fair market value of the investments, FTI used the projected cash
flows for each PV plant discounted back to the Valuation Date. The Respondent contends
that the “gratuitous nature of the incentives systems (and to the certainty of receiving
periodically cash flow from the State)” makes a DCF analysis inappropriate because of its
“high speculative character.” The Tribunal understands the Respondent’s objection to be
that the use of a DCF analysis is inappropriate when cash flows are certain and there is low

risk. However, the certainty of cash flows makes a DCF analysis more, not less, appropriate

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, {| 771.

887.

888.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5
Award
Page 334

and the relative lower risk related to certain cash flows is accounted for in the WACC,

which is used to discount those certain cash flows back to the valuation date.

The Tribunal is satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, a DCF analysis can be
performed that results in a quantification of damages that is not speculative. The
investments at issue have been operating for a significant period. Given the highly
regulated nature of the investments (all of the electricity produced can be sold at prices and
costs that are either known or can be forecast with a high degree of confidence), the cash
flows can be estimated with confidence. The Tribunal notes that for the damages claimed
in relation to the breaches proved by the Claimants, a DCF methodology is particularly apt.
The Spalmaincentivi Decree resulted in a direct and measurable decrease in the IT tariffs
set out in the relevant Conto Energia Decrees without affecting the other variables used in

the DCF analysis.

By using the actual production figures for each PV plant and the relevant maintenance and
other costs, the damages claimed specifically relate to each investment. A DCF analysis, if
properly performed, allows an assessment of the impact of each measure on each
investment, which is the purpose of the damages analysis. For the IT Decrease specifically,
because the variables other than the IT rates in the DCF analysis remain constant, the
damages notionally amount to the difference between the IT rates before and after the
Spalmaincentivi Decree discounted back to the valuation date. In fact, while he did not
perform an assessment of the Claimants’ alleged damages, Mr. Miraglia did perform
calculations that provided “an evaluation of the change in revenues related to the ‘Spalma
incentivi’ Decree and the ‘Salva Alcoa’ Law.” These calculations were done using a DCF
methodology and resulted in an evaluation of the impact of the Spalmaincentivi Decree

that was very similar to that of the Claimants’ expert’s calculations.

The Tribunal also accepts the evidence that the DCF method is commonly used to
determine the fair market value of investments in the PV sector for purposes other than
damages calculations and that it is also appropriate for damages calculations. It is also a

method commonly used in valuing damages resulting from state measures. For these

Award
Page 335

reasons, the Tribunal finds that a DCF analysis is an appropriate way to measure the

Claimants’ damages in this case.

The Respondent through its expert, GRIF, argued that damages should be assessed in light
of “the objective and reasonable expectations of investors at the time the investments were

made,”!2!2

GRIF compared the IT Decrease as a proportion of the increased productivity
of the PV plants and concluded that “investors continue to realise profits well beyond their
expectations” even after the measures were imposed.'*!? GRIF criticizes the foundation of
the FTI report arguing that the damages should not be evaluated using data updated to the
time of the claim for alleged damages, but should instead be based on the objective
legitimate expectations as to returns at the time of investment. GRIF’s opinion is that if the
damages problem in this arbitration were to measure the difference between the original IT
rates and the IT Decrease, there would be no need for expert reports; it is evident that “all
other factors being equal, if a tariff is cut by X after a certain number of years, revenues
for the plant will decrease by Y.”'?!* GRIF calculates a rate of return of 18.8% when it
compares its analysis of what it says an investor would have objectively expected based on
the information available at the time of the investment to the Claimants’ actual cash flows
and concludes that this rate is an unreasonable expectation “in a regulatory context

characterised by low variability and increasing revenues.” !?!°

The Tribunal understands the Respondent’s position to be that the proper measure of
damages in this case is the difference between what an investor would have objectively
expected in terms of cash flows at the time of investment and what the actual cash flows
were for the PV plants at issue. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ approach is the
same. Where the Parties disagree is as to what the expectation of the investors were as to
those cash flows and the proper date at which to assess damages. In this case, the Claimants
have successfully proved that their legitimate expectation was that the Respondent would

continue to pay the IT rates set out in the relevant Conto Energia Decree for a period of

twenty years. The Respondent argued, but failed to establish, that investors could only have
legitimately expected some “reasonable” rate of return. The Respondent could have set up
its regime that way, but deliberately chose not to do so, which left potential investors to
make their own determinations as to whether the IT rates would yield a reasonable rate of
return according to their own requirements. The Conto Energia regime encouraged
investors to be efficient and innovative by promising higher returns if they minimize cost
and maximize output, but to bear the risk of earning lower returns if the opposite occurred.
The Respondent specifically accepted this in its post-hearing submissions where it said:

The incentives at stake are not considered as a measure given ex post on the basis

of actual costs or returns, but rather an incentive calculated ex ante on the basis of

average costs. It is not the business of the regulator to care whether an

entrepreneur is performing better or worst [sic]. On the opposite, the regulator

gives the same incentive to everyone under the same circumstances then leaving
the market compete on who will be able to make a better investment. !7!6

In effect, the Respondent now argues that the Claimants should only be entitled to what a
hypothetical investor would have expected the value of the investment to be based on
average costs and set tariff rates. In other words, the Respondent suggests that the correct
measure of damages is what it expected the impact to investors would have been based on
some of the information that was available in the market at the time, but without taking
into account what the Claimants actually considered or their own assessment of their ability

to make a “better investment” as an efficient operator.

The Claimants established that they considered the capital costs at the time of their
investments, the tariff rates and the entire regulatory regime in deciding to make their
investments in Italy. Further, the Claimants established that their expectation to receive the
tariff rates set out in the Conto Energia Decrees, unchanged for a period of twenty years,
were legitimate. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that the proper measure of
damages is the impact on the value of the Claimants’ investments arising from the
difference between the cash flows at those rates and the cash flows at the lower rates

introduced by the Spalmaincentivi Decree at the Valuation Date.

RPHB, § 77.

Award
Page 337

The Tribunal notes that although the liability analysis is objective in its determination of
which expectations will be legitimate, the damages analysis is subjective, as it seeks to
award full compensation to these Claimants for their losses arising from the measure. In
order to award full compensation, the Claimants’ actual losses must be assessed, not the
losses suffered (or not) by some hypothetical investor. The analysis should be based on the
Claimants’ actual production figures and costs unless it can be argued that using those
figures would be unreasonable because the Claimants somehow contributed to their own

damages or failed to mitigate them.

In any event, in the circumstances of this case where the only damages that have been
proved are those relating to the IT Decrease, it is a situation where all else is equal in the
damages analysis. By adjusting the other components of the DCF analysis, such as using
one set of projected production rates for the Counterfactual Scenario and the actual
production rates in the Actual Scenario, it would no longer be an apples-to-apples
comparison. The Respondent’s approach would result in a calculation of hypothetical

losses and not actual losses.

The Respondent’s experts opine that damages should be assessed based on expectations at
the time of investment rather than at the time of the breach. They state that this is the only
approach that is consistent with a regulated subsidy system subject to future changes by
the regulator, as the expectations as to returns were assessed by investors at the time of
investment. The problem with this approach is that it is inconsistent with the customary
international law principle of full compensation, which is not based on expected losses but
on actual losses. Typically, the most accurate way to evaluate actual losses related to a
specific measure is to value the investment immediately before and after the breach.
Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts that the Claimants’ proposed Valuation Date is the
appropriate date at which to assess the Claimants’ damages flowing from the

Spalmaincentivi Decree.

In arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent’s
proposed approach both with respect to its position that the Salva Alcoa Decree is relevant

for the assessment of damages (or, more accurately, their mitigation) and that a DCF

analysis results in “an excessive remuneration of the invested capital ... from a general

point of view.”!7!”

As discussed above, the Salva Alcoa Decree extended the benefits of Conto II tariffs to
plants constructed by the end of 2010 and connected to the grid by 30 June 2011. This
granted the grid operator additional time to connect the plants that had met the construction
deadline of 31 December 2010 without penalizing those plants for not meeting a deadline
over which they had no control. The Respondent submits that the Salva Alcoa Decree had

a positive impact on Claimants’ cash flow of €10.7 million!?!*

and argues that this should
be taken into account in assessing Claimants’ losses as a result of the measures. The
Tribunal does not consider this appropriate for two reasons. First, there were no claims
based on the Salva Alcoa Decree, as that law had the effect of preserving an investor’s
legitimate expectation that if it met all of the requirements over which it had control in
Conto II, it would receive the tariff rate guaranteed thereunder. The measure did not change
investor’s obligations; there was no extension granted to plants to complete their
construction; the extension was granted to the grid operator whose role was to connect the
plants to the grid. Second, it would be inconsistent with the approach of assessing damages
as at the date of the breach to take into account measures that preceded the breach and that

were unrelated to the breach.

As for the submission that a DCF analysis would result in an excessive remuneration of
the invested capital, the Respondent has failed to prove that this would be the case.
Although GRIF alleged that the reconstructed expected rates of return were “up to 18.8%”
based on the data available at the time of the investment, FTI calculated the post-tax cost
of capital for PV investments in 2011 at 8.2% and the actual post-tax returns on Claimants’

plants on average as 7.5%.'7!° In the Counterfactual Position, FTI calculated an

approximate post-tax project IRR of 6.6% across all of the Claimants’ plants.'?° There

was no indication that returns in the range of 6.6% - 7.5% were excessive.

C. QUANTUM OF DAMAGES (ISSUE 5.3)

899. As the Tribunal has determined that the Claimants’ approach to the assessment of damages
is appropriate in this case, it will now review the calculations performed by FTI and any

criticisms of those calculations submitted by the Respondent. '??!

a. The Claimants’ Arguments

900. As has already been discussed, the Claimants’ expert, FTI, calculates the quantum of
compensation owed to the Claimants based on the difference between: (a) the value that
the Claimants’ Investments in Italy would have had if the Respondent had not introduced
the Challenged Measures (the but-for or Counterfactual Position), which excludes any of
the impacts of the Challenged Measures; and (b) the value of the Claimants’ Investments

after the introduction of those measures (the Actual Position). !???

901. FTI performs two DCF calculations — one in the Counterfactual Position and one in the
Actual Position — so as to isolate the cash flow impacts of each of the Challenged Measures,
for each of the Claimants’ investments. '223 FTI’s Mr. Edwards explained that his analysis
considers future losses, since the Challenged Measures affected the revenues that the
Claimants’ plants were capable of earning for the remainder of those plants’ economic
lives, right up until the end of the incentive tariff period.!?4 Mr. Edwards testified that in

order to assess the Claimants’ lost future profits, he first valued those plants to understand

how their value had changed as a result of each of the Challenged Measures.!275

1220 See FTI Q2, p. 70, Table A5-3-1.
fat For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to review in detail the assumptions
and calculations of the alternative damages scenario proposed by the Respondent, which it has rejected on legal
grounds.

(i) Cashflow Forecasts

Mr. Edwards explained that his cashflow forecasts in the Counterfactual and Actual
Positions share three common assumptions, which are relatively predictable once plants

were up and running. '??6

First, the cashflow forecasts were based on two or three years of actual production and
financial data.'??’ FTI forecasted future power production based on the average actual
power generated in 2012-2014 (with minor adjustments to account for insurance against
production disruptions), which FTI then adjusted downward to account for the future
degradation of equipment.'?* FTI forecasted market revenue from electricity sales by
multiplying the projected electricity production by the “central” forecast of wholesale
prices prepared by Péyry (an independent consulting firm that publishes price forecasts

that are used widely throughout the European energy industry). !72°

Second, the cashflow forecasts were based on largely fixed and predictable costs by
extrapolating from historical costs (adjusted for certain “one-off” events) and projecting

them to increase with expected inflation. !7°°

Third, the cashflow forecasts were based on weather, technical performance, and incentive

tariff driven revenues.

(ii) Discount Rate

Mr. Edwards explained that the next step in his analysis involved discounting the
forecasted cashflows to arrive at a valuation of the plants, which he did by applying a
standard WACC discount rate of 5%. This produces an estimate of the post-tax cost of
capital applicable to an Italian PV plant on the Date of Assessment. Mr. Edwards calculated

a cost of equity at 7.8% and estimated a cost of debt for the Claimants on the Date of

Assessment at 4.3%, which resulted in a post-tax discount basis of 3.1%, for a blended
average of those two costs of 5%.'?3! Mr. Edwards disagrees with GRIF’s contention that
the Claimants’ investments were very low risk and thus a lower cost of capital ought to
apply. Mr. Edwards pointed out that the GSE used a 5% discount rate in mid-2013 in its
LOCOE calculations, which he says is consistent with the discount rate that he used in his

analysis. !?>7

GRIF did not explicitly challenge Mr. Edwards’ calculation of cost of capital. However,
Mr. Edwards responded to GRIF’s apparent suggestion that a lower cost of capital should
be used (it says that the Claimants’ plants’ risk profile is similar to a government bond),
noting that the use of a lower discount rate would result in higher losses because future

cash flows are discounted by a lower number. !?°3
(iii) Assumptions behind the Counterfactual and Actual Positions
FTI determined the future impact of the Spalmaincentivi Decree in the two DCF scenarios
(Counterfactual and Actual) as follows: !?°4
IT Decrease

e Inthe Counterfactual Position, FTI assumes that the Incentive Tariff rate is the
rate specified in the applicable Conto before the reduction introduced by the

Spalmaincentivi Decree.

e In the Actual Position, the applicable Incentive Tariff rate is the rate following

the reduction introduced by the Spalmaincentivi Decree, according to Option C.

When asked by the Tribunal how he calculated the Claimants’ total losses occasioned by
each of the Challenged Measures, Mr. Edwards explained that the only difference between

the Actual and Counterfactual valuations are the differences introduced by each individual

Measure, and that the DCF model allowed him to identify these and track the impact of
each Measure separately.'2°> Mr. Edwards explained that he started with two Actual
Position valuations assuming that none of the measures were claimable, and then one by
one, he introduced the effect of each Challenged Measure to each of the valuations to track
how the total loss figure evolved with each Measure individually. '?*° He explained that if
the Tribunal were to find that one or more of the Challenged Measures was not
compensable, it would simply deduct the total losses for that category from €28.6 million

(the grand total of the Claimants’ losses). '?37

Mr. Edwards calculated the effect of each of the challenged measures as follows: '2**

reduced the value of Claimants’ investments by €17.5 million, or 7.5% of the fair market

value of the Investments. !2°°

The Claimants explain that the DCF models determine the enterprise value of each
operating company, in both the Counterfactual Position and Actual Position, as of the Date
of Assessment.!4° FTI then deducts the third-party debt held by each operating company
to determine the value of the investment in each operating company, in both the
Counterfactual Position and Actual Position, as of the Date of Assessment.!*4! The
Claimants’ losses for each operating company are the differences between the value of the

investment in the Counterfactual Position and the Actual Position. !?47

b. The Respondent’s Arguments

As has been discussed, the Respondent did not critique the calculations performed by FTI
and instead focused their criticism on the basis of the report arguing that using an analysis
of the impact of the measures on the fair market value of the investments was not the right

approach.

The Respondent did submit evidence from the GSE’s Mr. Miraglia, which sought to
estimate the variances in the revenues related to the application of the Spalmaincentivi
Decree and the Salva Alcoa Decree on the Claimants’ investments. Mr. Miraglia’s
calculations were aimed at demonstrating the reasonableness of the IT Decrease in the
context of the tariffs to be paid to the Claimants’ investments over a period of twenty years.

He calculates this overall reduction to be in the range of 2-3%. Mr. Miraglia’s calculations

plus the “IT Payment Term Change” of €1.5 million. As the Tribunal has found no breach related to the IT Payment
Term Change, this aspect of the Claimants’ damages claim will not be considered further. The figures are provided

with respect to the impact of the Spalmaincentivi Decree was essentially identical to FTI’s;

he arrived at a figure of €16.6 million for the IT Decrease. 73

ce. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal accepts FTI’s assessment of the damages caused to the Claimants’
investments as a result of the Spalmaincentivi Decree. It has reviewed the assumptions on
which the analysis is based and finds these to be reasonable and supported by the evidence.
The Tribunal finds that the Claimants have proved losses related to the IT Decrease in the

amount of €16 million at the Date of Assessment.

INTEREST (ISSUE 6)

The Claimants also claim pre-award and post-award interest in order to be fully

compensated for their losses due to the Spalmaincentivi Decree.

THE CLAIMANTS’ ARGUMENTS

The Claimants request both pre- and post-award interest at the highest lawful rate from the
Date of Assessment (1 January 2015) until the date the Respondent pays the award in full,

calculated at a rate based on international interest rates, on a compounded basis. !744

FTI’s Mr. Edwards explained that, as instructed by the Claimants, he added interest to his
Actual Position and Counterfactual Position calculations from 1 January 2015 to 22 June
2018.'°45 He did so in two ways: by calculating interest on the basis of the Respondent’s
cost of borrowing; and by calculating interest at the Claimants’ cost of debt, which he stated
is effectively a measure of the additional interest the Claimants have had to pay because
1246

they have not had the funds by which to repay their debt, and thus save interest costs.

FTI explains the difference between these two alternative rates of interest as follows:

Italian 3 year government bonds

7.3 The interest rates on Italian government bonds reflect Italy’s cost of
borrowing. Consequently, a calculation of interest on the Claimants’ losses based
on Italian 3 year government bond yields is in effect, the interest rate that the
Claimants would have received had they willingly lent the funds in dispute to Italy
on the Date of Assessment. The yield on a 3 year Italian government bond at the
Date of Assessment was 0.7%.

The Claimants’ cost of debt

7.4 A calculation of interest based on the Claimants’ cost of debt is, in effect, the
interest that the Claimants could have saved on their debt had they been

compensated for their losses immediately and used the funds to repay their third
party debt.!27

The following table shows FTI’s calculated interest for damages assessed based on all of
the alleged breaches from the Date of Assessment to 10 November 2017 (which would
need to be updated to the date of the Award) using the aforementioned illustrative rates:

(a) the Respondent’s cost of debt; and (b) the Claimants’ cost of debt:

appropriate than simple interest where the claimant could have received the latter by simply
placing its money in a readily available and commonly used investment vehicle.!”°°
Compound interest also “more accurately reflects what the claimant would have been able

to ‘earn on the sums owed if they had been paid in a timely manner.””!?5!

The Claimants also argue that compound interest “furthers the principle of full
compensation because it aids in restoring the claimant to the position in which it would
have been had the respondent not committed the breach.” !?°? The goal of interest is to place
the parties in the same position they would have been had the award been made
immediately after the cause of action arose, and thus simple interest fails to fully
compensate claimants.!2*> Compound interest “prevents unjust enrichment of the
respondent by requiring it to pay compensation for the benefits received from using the

money it wrongfully withheld.”!?**

The Claimants contest the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal should not grant pre-
award interest because most of the damages concern future events. The Claimants state that
the Respondent’s assertion ignores that FTI calculated damages as of 1 January 2015, and
that FTI discounted losses arising from future events by 5% to a date almost four years in

the past, which reduced the damages estimate accordingly.!7°>

The Claimants also take issue with the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal should not
award compound interest because simple interest is less speculative and the Challenged

Measures were public policy objectives. The Claimants argue that compound interest most

In response to the Tribunal’s question of how to adjust the interest if they find that one or
more of the Challenged Measures is not compensable, FTI’s Mr. Edwards explained that
the Tribunal would “just reduce the interest number [Table 7-8, above] pro rata to the
amount that you are removing from the [€28.6 million total losses] ... it is all essentially

proportional.”!25*

At the hearing, FTI provided two alternative pre-hearing interest calculations up to the date
of the hearing. With interest calculated from 1 January 2015 up until the date of
Mr. Edward’s testimony (22 June 2018), FTI estimates that the Claimants’ losses are
between €29.1 million (when calculated using Italian 3-year government bonds) and

€31.5 million (when calculated using Claimants’ cost of debt).!7°°

THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

The Respondent asserts that no pre-award interest and only post-award interest should be

awarded for the following reasons:

Challenged Measures, the “high benefits” the Claimants earned from entering
the market “at a time when investment costs had already been highly reduced
but incentives had not yet been consistently adjusted,” and the “unexpected

positive effects of the Salva Alcoa Decree.” 7°

The Respondent made no submissions regarding the appropriate rate of either pre-award

or post-award interest.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal finds that an award of pre-award interest is necessary to fully compensate the
Claimants for the losses caused by the Spalmaincentivi Decree. Although the Respondent
argues that interest is inappropriate on future cash flows, that ignores the fact that the
damages in this case have been assessed as of 1 January 2015 and that the future cash flows
had been discounted to that date. In order to fully compensate the Claimants for their losses,

interest on the amount of €16 million must be awarded to the date of this award.

The rate of interest that most accurately captures the Claimants’ losses is the Claimants’
cost of debt, which FTI calculated using the 12-month Euribor plus a spread of
approximately 4.0% on the Date of Assessment.'7°3 The average rate was approximately
4.0% from January 2015 through November 2017. As this is the Claimants’ actual cost of
debt, this rate of interest best accords with the principle of full compensation. There was
no evidence that it was excessive or unusual such that it would overcompensate for the
Claimants’ losses. This rate of interest reflects the borrowing costs that could have been
avoided by the Claimants if the FIT rates had not been reduced through the Spalmaincentivi

Decree.

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, §] 777.
The Claimants’ expert also provided an alternative interest calculation based on the Italian government bond

rate, which represents the interest rate that Italy would have paid if it had borrowed the funds (or the rate that the
Claimants would have received if they had willingly lent the funds to Italy). However, the Claimants did not willingly
lend the funds to the Respondent and the Respondent did not argue that this rate was more appropriate. The Measures
found to have breached the ECT resulted in lower tariff rates, which in turn resulted in lower cash flows from the
Investments and a related cost of borrowing incurred by the Claimants as a result of the Measures. In these
circumstances, the Tribunal considers that awarding interest at the Claimants’ cost of borrowing is the proper measure
of this component of the damages claim.

ICSID CASE NO. ARB/16/5

Page 349

930. The Tribunal is of the view that the pre-award interest should be compounded annually in

order to properly compensate the Claimants for the loss of the use of those funds.

931. Accordingly, the Claimants are awarded interest at the 12-month Euribor rate plus 4.0%
compounded annually on the damages awarded of €16 million from 1 January

2015 through the date of this award.

932. The Respondent does not contest that post-award interest is appropriate in the event that
damages are awarded. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants are also entitled

to post-award interest at this rate.
XIV. COSTS (ISSUE 7)

933. The issue for the Tribunal’s determination is whether either Party should bear some, or all,
of the opposing Party’s costs. Both Parties claim their costs on the basis of the ICSID

Arbitration Rules.

A. THE CLAIMANTS’ ARGUMENTS

934. In order to place the Claimants in the same position they would have been if not for the
Respondent’s breach of its ECT obligations, the Claimants request that the Tribunal award

it all of its arbitration costs and expenses, including its attorneys’ fees. '2°*

parties pursuant to Articles 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Article 28(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules.!”°> Factors weighing in favour of a full costs award include a party’s
conduct during the proceeding and the overall outcome of the case, including the extent to

for these services. The Claimants note that their actual legal fees incurred will be based on

the hybrid “fixed fee plus success fee” basis agreed with their legal representatives. The
fixed fee portion paid totals €1,250,000 and an additional success fee will be payable upon

successful recovery.

The Claimants also note that their ICSID advances on costs total includes a significant
share of the Respondent’s additional advance on costs (€125,233.87), which they were
requested to advance when Italy failed to make its payments to ICSID in a timely

manner. !27!

THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

The Respondent did not make any substantive submissions on costs, but claimed legal fees,
general expenses, administrative costs and costs of attendance at the hearing totalling
US$775,660.79. 272

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

Rule 28(1), in turn, provides as follows:

(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the
proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:

(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay,
pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre;

i) ICSID’s lodging fee, ii) the Claimants’ share of the three advance payments

 

requested by ICSID and iii) “a significant share of Italy’s advance on costs ... Therefore, the Euro figure corresponds
to the sum actually expended by Claimants for ICSID payments to date.”

(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as
determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular
share by one of the parties.
(2) Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the
Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding
and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts
paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the
proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the
parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning
the cost of the proceeding.

The Tribunal has the discretion to award the reasonable costs of the proceedings and the
primary relevant factors are: the relative success of the parties and their conduct throughout

the proceedings.

The Tribunal has reviewed the costs as claimed by the Parties and determined that the
amounts claimed are reasonable in light of the length of the proceedings, the complexity

of the issues and the process required by the Rules.

As to success on the substantive claims, the Claimants have succeeded in establishing that
one of the Challenged Measures breached the ECT and been generally successful in
defending against Italy’s jurisdictional objections. The Claimants have been awarded
approximately 56 percent of their total damages claimed. In light of this outcome, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate for the Respondent to bear its own costs and for it to

contribute to the costs incurred by the Claimants in bringing their claims.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction and the related
applications contributed significantly to the overall cost of the proceedings and the
Tribunal estimates that this aspect of the case, including the arguments related to the tax
measures, accounted for approximately 40% of the overall cost. Of the remaining issues,
the Tribunal estimates that approximately one half of the costs related to the issues related
to the Spalmaincentivi Decree, which was the main focus of the Claimants’ submissions,
and one half to the other Measures. This is generally consistent with the proportion of the

damages awarded (56%) compared to the damages claimed (the damages claimed for the

Award

reduction in FITs and the related payment term changes accounted for approximately 60%

of the overall damages). !273

947. The estimated costs of the arbitration proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the

Tribunal, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Mr. Henri Alvarez 381,565.91
Dr. Michael Pryles 118,449.96
Prof. Laurence Boisson de Chazournes 114,854.70

Direct expenses (estimated) 98,272.01
Total (estimated) 913,142.58

948. The costs of the proceeding have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties.!?”
The Tribunal notes that the advance payments made by the parties and the final costs of

the arbitration proceeding will be reflected in ICSID’s final financial statement.

949. The Claimants were required to commence the arbitration in order to be compensated for
their losses related to the Respondent’s breaches of the ECT, which they have established.
Accordingly, the Tribunal considers it appropriate for the Respondent to bear the entirety

of the costs of the proceeding reflected in ICSID’s final financial statement.

950. The majority of the Tribunal also considers it appropriate for the Claimants to be awarded
a proportion of their legal and expert fees and costs and other expenses proportionate to
their degree of success in the arbitration. Accordingly, the Claimants are awarded 60% of

their reasonable legal fees and other expenses calculated as €1,758,577.!77>

1278 Note that the damages awarded were less than those claimed because of both the Respondent’s success on

some of its jurisdictional objections related to tax claims and its success in establishing that the Measures other than
the Spalmaincentivi Decree did not amount to breaches of the ECT.

1274 The remaining balance in the ICSID case account will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the

payments that they advanced to ICSID.
1275 Sixty percent of the total costs claimed (as reflected in paragraph 937) excluding “ICSID Payments” claimed:
60% of (€3,527,068 - €596,106) = €1,758,577.
