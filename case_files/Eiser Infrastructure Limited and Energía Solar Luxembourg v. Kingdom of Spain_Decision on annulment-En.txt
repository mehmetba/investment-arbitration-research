1. Spain’s Argument: 9

 

a) The lack of impartiality and independence of an arbitrator warrants the
annulment of an award due to the improper constitution of the tribunal .............. 9

b) The Applicant can raise the issue because the facts upon which it bases
its argument became known after the Award was rendered

 

c) The appropriate standard to determine lack of independence and
impartiality is a “manifest appearance Of Dias” 0.0.0... cceeeeeeeeeeeesteeeeeeeeeeeeneeee 11
d) The “appearance of bias” is demonstrated by the longstanding
relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and Brattle, and by the failure to
disclose this relationship. 12
2. Eiser Parties’ Arguments 17

a) An award can only be annulled for failure to comply with the steps
necessary to constitute the tribunal at the outset of the proceeding

   

b) Inany event, the standard applicable to a challenge of an arbitrator is high
and is even higher at the 1 phase 18
c) The Applicant has waived its right to challenge Dr. Alexandrov since it
should have known of his professional relationship with Brattle during the
arbitration 19

d) Dr. Alexandrov’s relationship with the Brattle Group does not warrant

L INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns an application by the Kingdom of Spain for annulment (“Spain’s
Application” or the “Application for Annulment”) of the Award rendered on
May 4, 2017 (the “Award”) by the Arbitral Tribunal composed of Prof. John R. Crook
(President), Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, and Prof. Campbell McLachlan (the “Tribunal”)
in the arbitration proceedings between Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar
Luxembourg S.a r.l. and the Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36
(the “Underlying Arbitration”).

The Award relates to a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the 1994 Energy Charter
Treaty (the “ECT”), which entered into force on April 16, 1998 for Luxembourg, the
United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Spain, as well as the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into

force on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Parties are, on the one hand, the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain’”, the “Applicant” or the
“Respondent”) and, on the other hand, the Claimants in the original arbitration
proceedings: Eiser Infrastructure Limited, a private limited company incorporated under
the laws of the United Kingdom, and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.a r.]., a private limited
liability company (société a responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg, who are Respondents in these annulment proceedings (the “Eiser Parties”

or the “Claimants”).

The Applicant and the Claimants are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties”,
and individually referred to as a “Party.” The Parties’ representatives and their addresses

are listed above on page (i).

The dispute in the Underlying Arbitration proceedings related to claims asserted under the

ECT, in respect of measures implemented by Spain. These measures according to the Eiser

Parties modified the regulatory and economic regime of renewable energy projects thereby

failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to them under Article 10(1) of the ECT.

6. In the Award, the Tribunal unanimously held that it had jurisdiction to hear the dispute
under the ECT and the ICSID Convention, and that the Applicant had violated Article 10(1)
of the ECT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants.! It further
decided that it need not determine the Claimants’ remaining claims, on the grounds of
judicial economy (financial and jurisprudential), as these remaining claims would not alter
the outcome or affect the damages to which Claimants are entitled.* As a result of this
breach, the Tribunal ordered the Applicant to pay the Eiser Parties €128 million in
damages.’ Pre-Award interest was ordered at the rate of 2.07%, compounded monthly
(June 20, 2014 to May 4, 2017), and Post-Award interest at a rate of 2.50%, compounded
monthly (May 4, 2017 to the date of payment).* The Tribunal also ordered that each Party
bears its legal fees and other expenses, and that the Parties bear the costs of the arbitration

in equal shares.>

7. Spain seeks the annulment of the Award under Article 52(1) (a), (b), (d) and (e) of the
ICSID Convention. The grounds for such annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention state as follows: (a) the Tribunal was not properly constituted; (b) the Tribunal
manifestly exceeded its powers; (d) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule

of procedure; and (e) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.

IL. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

8. On July 21, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID received Spain’s Application for

Annulment, together with Annexes | to 18, seeking the annulment of the Award and

Award, 1 486(a).

requesting that enforcement of the Award be stayed until the Application for Annulment

was decided.

On July 28, 2017, the Acting Secretary-General registered Spain’s Application for
Annulment. The Parties were also notified that the enforcement of the Award was

provisionally stayed pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

By letter dated October 23, 2017, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that, in
accordance with Rules 6, 52(2), and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, an ad hoc
Committee composed of Prof. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez (a national of Mexico),
Ms. Teresa Cheng (a national of China), and Judge Dominique Hascher (a national of
France) (the “Committee”) had been constituted. The Parties were also informed that
Prof. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez would be the President of the Committee and
Ms. Mairée Uran Bidegain, ICSID Team Leader and Legal Counsel, would serve as

Secretary of the Committee.

On November 22, 2017, Spain filed a Submission in Support of the Continuation of the
Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award, accompanied by Exhibits R-0262 to R-0270
and Legal Authorities RL-0001-bis, RL-0084-bis, and RL-0085 to RL-0094
(the “Application for Stay’).

By letter of November 27, 2017, the Committee invited the Eiser Parties to provide their
observations, if any, on Spain’s Application for Stay by no later than December 4, 2017.
The Committee informed the Parties that they would have the opportunity to address the
Committee on this issue, should they wish to do so, during the First Session scheduled for
December 9, 2017. In addition, the Committee informed the Parties that it had decided to
extend the stay until it had heard the Parties and was in a position to reach a final

determination on the Application for Stay.

On December 4, 2017, the Eiser Parties filed their Response to Spain’s Application for
Stay, accompanied by Exhibits C-0299 to C-0303 and Legal Authorities CL-0244 to
CL-0264.

20.

On December 9, 2017, the Parties, the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee held
the first session of the Committee at the World Bank Group premises in Paris, France (the
“First Session”). On the occasion of the First Session, Spain and the Eiser Parties presented

their oral submissions on the continuation of the stay of enforcement.

By letter of December 14, 2017, the Committee invited the Parties to present two rounds

of further written submissions on the question of the stay of enforcement of the Award.

On December 21, 2017, Spain filed a second Submission in Support of Continuation of the
Stay of Enforcement, accompanied by Exhibits R-0271 to R-0274 and Legal Authorities
RL-0090-bis and RL-0095 to RL-0101. On the same date, the Eiser Parties filed their

Further Submission on the Continuation of the Provisional Stay.

On January 4, 2018, Spain filed its Further Submission in Support of Continuation of the
Stay of Enforcement, accompanied by Exhibits R-0275 to R-0279. On the same date, the
Eiser Parties filed their Final Submission on the Continuation of the Provisional Stay of
Enforcement of the Award, accompanied by Exhibits C-0304 to C-0311 and Legal
Authorities CL-0265 to CL-0271.

Spain’s submission of January 4, 2018 was accompanied by a cover letter, whereby Spain
requested that the Committee direct the Eiser Parties: (a) to provide disclosure on an
immediate basis as to whether they have sold or otherwise transferred their interests in the
Award to one or more third parties (including either the right to collect funds and/or the
right to enforcement); (b) to identify the third-party buyers/transferees; and (c) to provide
a copy of the agreement(s) with those parties, so that Spain may understand the terms of
the arrangement. Spain further alleged that the Claimants had withheld their final
arguments until after Spain had filed its submission first, thereby denying Spain an

opportunity to fully respond to the Claimants’ arguments.

On January 8, 2018, without requesting leave from the Committee, Spain submitted an

additional letter reiterating the arguments of its letter dated January 4, 2018.

On January 15, 2018, at the request of the Claimants, the Committee invited the Claimants

to provide their observations on Spain’s letter dated January 4, 2018.

The Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 on January 19, 2018, concerning various
procedural matters. The Parties confirmed, among other items, that the 2006 ICSID

Arbitration Rules would apply to the annulment proceedings.

On January 22, 2018, the Eiser Parties filed a reply to Spain’s letters of January
4 and 8, 2018.

On March 8, 2018, in accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Procedural Order
No. 1, Spain filed its Memorial in Support of Application for Annulment (“Annulment
Memorial”), along with an Appendix on the Assumptions and Calculations in the Brattle

Model, Exhibits R-0280 to R-0311, and Legal Authorities RL-0102 to RL-0164.

On March 23, 2018, the Committee issued a decision on the stay of enforcement of the
Award, deciding that there were no circumstances that required the stay to be continued
pending its decision on annulment (“Decision on Stay”). However, the Committee
confirmed and gave full effect to the Eiser Parties’ undertaking to “promptly [...] repay
Spain any and all amounts received in satisfaction of the Award to the extent that the
annulment application is successful” and not to “disburse or transfer any amounts received
in satisfaction of the Award to their investors or to any other third party while the
annulment proceeding is ongoing (or thereafter to the extent the annulment application is

6

successful).”° To this effect, the Committee ordered the Eiser Parties to submit, with all

the necessary formalities, such undertaking to Spain.

By letter of April 2, 2018, pursuant to the instructions of the Committee in its Decision on
Stay, counsel for the Claimants provided Spain with an undertaking to promptly repay any
and all amounts received in satisfaction of the Award rendered on May 4, 2017 to the extent
that the annulment application was successful. Counsel for the Eiser Parties further
confirmed their undertaking not to disburse or transfer any amounts received in satisfaction
of the Award to their investors or to any other third party while the annulment proceedings

were ongoing (or thereafter to the extent the annulment application was successful).

On April 4, 2018, following the resignation of Committee member Teresa Cheng, the
Secretary-General notified the Parties of the vacancy on the Committee and that the

proceedings were suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 10(2) and 53.

By its letter of April 5, 2018, Spain argued that Claimants’ letter of April 2 failed to satisfy
the “necessary formalities” as ordered by the Committee in its Decision on Stay. It further
requested that the Eiser Parties provide the required undertaking with the “necessary
formalities”, and advised that until and unless the requirement was met it would consider

that the provisional stay of enforcement remained in effect.

On April 20, 2018, Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan accepted his appointment as a member of the
Committee by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, in accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rules 11 and 53. The Parties were notified that the Committee was hereby
reconstituted. Its members are: Prof. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez (a national of Mexico),
as President, Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan (a national of Pakistan), and Judge Dominique
Hascher (a national of France). In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 12 and 53, the

proceedings were resumed from the point in time when the vacancy had occurred.

On May 31, 2018, Spain filed a Request for Modification of the Committee’s Decision on
Stay of Enforcement of the Award (“Request for Modification”), together with Exhibits
R-0312 to R-0319 and Legal Authorities RL-0165 to RL-0168.

On June 11, 2018, the Eiser Parties filed Claimants’ Counter-Memorial on Annulment
(“Annulment Counter-Memorial”), accompanied by Exhibits C-0304 to C-0323 and
Legal Authorities CL-0265 to CL-0299.

On June 22, 2018, the Eiser Parties filed a response to the Request for Modification,
accompanied by Legal Authorities CL-0300 to CL-0306.

On July 19, 2018, the European Commission (“EC”) filed an Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (“Application for Leave”), pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rule 37(2).

On August 7, 2018, the Eiser Parties filed observations on the Application for Leave,
together with Exhibits C-0324 to C-0325 and Legal Authorities CL-0307 to CL-0310.
On the same date, Spain filed observations on the Application for Leave, together with

Exhibit R-0320.

On August 10, 2018, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the Request
for Modification in which it: (a) rejected the Request for Modification, confirming that the
stay of enforcement was terminated as of March 23, 2018, pursuant to the Decision on
Stay; (b) ordered the Eiser Parties to provide further evidence supporting the fact that the
Directors signing the undertaking dated April 18, 2018 were duly authorized to bind the
Eiser Parties regarding repayment and disbursement of funds and that their decisions could
not be overridden; and (c) ordered the Eiser Parties to provide confirmation of the above

referred undertaking.

By letter of August 13, 2018, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties
that Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu had been appointed to serve as the Secretary of the

Committee, replacing Ms. Uran Bidegain.

On August 24, 2018, Spain filed its Reply Memorial in Support of Application for
Annulment (“Annulment Reply”), accompanied by Exhibits R-0321 to R-333 and Legal
Authorities RL-0169 to RL-0193.

On October 11, 2018, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the EC’s
Application for Leave pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2). The Committee allowed
the European Commission to file a written submission as a non-disputing party on whether
the Tribunal had seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by requiring a
commitment from the European Commission to pay the costs associated with such written
submission, and by refusing the Commission’s written submission after it refused to

provide the requested commitment.

On November 6, 2018, the Eiser Parties filed Claimants’ Rejoinder on Annulment
(“Annulment Rejoinder”), accompanied by Exhibits C-0326 to C-0347 and Legal
Authorities CL-0311 to CL-0321.

submission pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), together with Exhibits C-0367 to C-
0370 and Legal Authorities CL-0322 to CL-0340. On the same date, Spain filed

37(2), together with Legal Authority RL-0194.

Ill. PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

A. IMPROPER CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL
1. Spain’s Arguments

Spain argues that: (a) the lack of impartiality and independence of an arbitrator warrants
the annulment of the award due to the improper constitution of the tribunal; (b) it can raise
the issue because the facts upon which it bases its argument became known only after the
Award was rendered; (c) the appropriate standard to determine lack of impartiality and
independence is a “manifest appearance of bias”; and, (d) in the case at hand, such
“manifest appearance of bias” arises from the long-standing relationship between
Dr. Alexandrov and the Brattle Group (“Brattle Group” or “Brattle”), and the failure to

disclose this relationship.

a) The lack of impartiality and independence of an arbitrator warrants the
annulment of an award due to the improper constitution of the tribunal

Under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, a party may seek the annulment of an

award if the tribunal “was not properly constituted.” According to the Applicant, this

provision has to be read together with Chapter IV, Section 2 of the ICSID Convention titled
“Constitution of the Tribunal”, which includes Article 40(2). Article 40(2) states that the
arbitrators must possess the qualities listed in Article 14(1), which include impartiality and
independence. Thus, under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, an award can be
annulled for improper constitution of the tribunal if an arbitrator did not possess the

qualities of impartiality and independence.”

47. For the Applicant, Dr. Alexandrov’s inability to furnish explanations in the annulment
proceeding does not change its position. The Committee has the necessary information to
decide the issue and Dr. Alexandrov’s inability to provide comments should not undercut

the Applicant’s right to have an independent and impartial tribunal.*

48. The Applicant rejects the Eiser Parties’ argument that Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID
Convention only applies to procedural deficiencies regarding the constitution of the
tribunal at the outset of an arbitration. The Applicant’s position is based on the following
reasons: (i) the Eiser Parties have not provided a single authority that supports such
interpretation;” (ii) issues related to the independence and impartiality of the arbitrators can
arise throughout the entire proceeding, as supported by Rule 6 of the Arbitration Rules;!°
and, (iii) previous committees and commentators have recognized that the tribunal was not
properly constituted if an arbitrator did not possess the qualities of independence and

impartiality."!

b) The Applicant can raise the issue because the facts upon which it bases its
argument became known after the Award was rendered

49. The Applicant recognizes that, as a general rule, a party must challenge the arbitrator
promptly, when the relevant facts are known and, in any event, before the proceeding is
declared closed. However, it has been recognized that a party can still challenge the
independence and impartiality of an arbitrator in annulment proceedings if the relevant

facts only became known once the arbitration proceedings were closed.'*

50. According to the Applicant, the facts surrounding the close relationship between
Dr. Alexandrov and Brattle only came to light after the Award was rendered, when public
reports of such relationship emerged in July 2017, as a consequence of a challenge filed in
an unrelated arbitration involving Pakistan.'* Therefore, it can still raise the challenge to

Dr. Alexandrov’s independence and impartiality at the annulment stage.

ce) The appropriate standard to determine lack of independence and impartiality is
a “manifest appearance of bias”

S51. According to the Applicant, to demonstrate the lack of independence and impartiality of
an arbitrator, it must prove that a reasonable third party would consider that there were

reasonable grounds for an appearance of dependence or bias.'* It is not required, however,

Group on the other; and (ii) Dr. Alexandrov’s failure to disclose this relationship in the

ground of improper constitution of the Tribunal.”

53. First, according to the Applicant, during the course of his 15 years at Sidley Austin’s
Washington, D.C. office, where Dr. Alexandrov was a partner and co-head of the firm’s
international arbitration practice, Dr. Alexandrov and his team appointed the Brattle Group
in numerous cases where he served as counsel, including, but not limited to, nine investor-
State arbitrations, including eight at ICSID alone, and numerous commercial arbitrations.7!

In four of these cases Mr. Lapuerta was the testifying expert.??

54. In Spain’s view, the fact that this took place while Dr. Alexandrov was at Sidley Austin is
of particular relevance for two reasons. First, the identity of an arbitrator and his law firm
must be considered as one for the purpose of identifying and revealing conflicts of interest.

Similarly, individual experts cannot simply be detached from the company for which they

agreement and thus I am not in a position to disclose further information.” (Ex. C-0317, Letter from Dr. Alexandrov

work, as the Eiser Parties assert.2> Second, it has been recognized that the fact that an
arbitrator is co-head of his firm’s worldwide international arbitration practice implies a
degree of connection and coordination that creates conflicts even if the arbitrator himself

was not involved in the representation.”*

Moreover, in two of these cases, Dr. Alexandrov was working with Brattle at the same time
that the Underlying Arbitration was taking place. In Pluspetrol and Bear Creek,
Dr. Alexandrov and/or his client appointed Mr. Lapuerta and the Brattle Group as the

experts, and worked together while the Underlying Arbitration was still pending.?>

Further, in SolEs Badajoz, Tethyan Copper, Blusun S.A., and Ioan Micula, Dr. Alexandrov
was appointed by the claimant as arbitrator while the Brattle Group also served as the
claimant’s expert.”° The Applicant makes the following arguments with respect to the first

two cases.

SolEs Badajoz: Spain challenged Dr. Alexandrov for similar reasons. After being provided
information that, simultaneously with the SolEs Badajoz proceedings, Dr. Alexandrov had
engaged Brattle in two inactive cases, the co-arbitrators informed ICSID that they were
‘equally divided’, thereby suggesting, according to Spain, that one of his co-arbitrators
thought “there were justifiable doubts regarding [Dr. Alexandrov’s] impartiality due to his
relationship with Brattle [...].”?’ If this was the position taken with respect to two pending

but inactive cases, the Applicant argues that this case warrants the same conclusion given

that, simultaneously with the Underlying Arbitration, Dr. Alexandrov was working with

Brattle in at least two active cases.”

Tethyan Copper: According to the Applicant, in this proceeding, the Eiser Parties have
filed non-public documents from the record of the Tethyan Copper case, which are subject
to confidentiality orders issued by the tribunal. Therefore, the Eiser Parties should explain
how they obtained such documents and, in case they were illegally obtained, the Committee
must not admit them into the record.”? In any event, while a challenge to Dr. Alexandrov
was rejected in that case, the Tethyan Copper case and the case at hand are substantially

different.*°

For the Applicant, the evidence put before the Committee regarding “the scope and extent
of the relationship between Mr. Alexandrov and Brattle before, during and after the Eiser
arbitration, including the fact that Mr. Alexandrov and Brattle were working together on
two other cases simultaneously with the Eiser case, manifestly gives rise to the appearance
of bias, impairing Mr. Alexandrov’s ability to impartially assess Brattle’s opinions.”*! This
in turn required the disqualification of Dr. Alexandrov and warrants the annulment of the

Award.?

Second, the Applicant argues that, although the existence of a longstanding relationship
between Dr. Alexandrov and Brattle alone is sufficient to constitute the appearance of bias,
such appearance of bias is also demonstrated by Dr. Alexandrov’s failure to disclose such

relationship.**

Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2)(b), arbitrators are continuously obliged to disclose

“any circumstance” that could create doubts, from the parties’ standpoint, regarding their

independence and impartiality. Therefore, in Spain’s view, Dr. Alexandrov had to disclose
his close working relationship with the Brattle Group.** Nevertheless, during the course of
the arbitration, Dr. Alexandrov never disclosed his 15-year long relationship with the
Brattle Group, nor that he was working simultaneously with Brattle while the arbitration
was taking place.*> Notably, Brattle also failed to disclose such relationship, which it had
a duty to do pursuant to Article 5(2) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in

International Arbitration.*°

62. Although a failure to disclose does not automatically demonstrate the arbitrator’s lack of
impartiality and independence, it does so, according to the Applicant, when it is a “part of
a pattern of circumstances raising doubts as to impartiality.”*’ For the Applicant,
Dr. Alexandrov’s failure to disclose his relationship with Brattle Group is not an isolated
occurrence and has also occurred in the Raiffeisen Bank, SolEs Badajoz, and Tethyan

Copper cases.** A reasonable third party would therefore conclude that Dr. Alexandrov

was unable to objectively and impartially assess the opinions of Brattle and that the Award

should be annulled.*?

2. Eiser Parties’ Arguments

The Eiser Parties argue that there is no basis to annul the Award for improper constitution
of the Tribunal for the following reasons: (a) an award can only be annulled for failure to
comply with the steps necessary to constitute the tribunal at the outset of the proceedings;
(b) in any event, the standard applicable to a challenge of an arbitrator is high and is even
higher in the annulment phase; (c) the Applicant has waived its right to challenge the
independence and impartiality of Dr. Alexandrov; (d) there was no conflict of interest
arising from the alleged relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and the Brattle Group that
would warrant annulment; (e) failure to make the alleged disclosure does not automatically
imply the lack of impartiality and independence of an arbitrator; and, (f) there is no

objective evidence of bias.

a) An award can only be annulled for failure to comply with the steps necessary to
constitute the tribunal at the outset of the proceeding

For the Eiser Parties, Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention is not meant to allow for

the post hoc challenge of one of the arbitrators, and only applies to the procedural steps

necessary to constitute the tribunal at the outset of the proceeding.*” Since Spain does not

allege anything in relation to these procedural steps, there is no basis to invoke

Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.*!

The Eiser Parties accept that this article must be read in light of Chapter IV, Section 2 of
the Convention, which deals with the process to be followed to constitute the Tribunal at
the outset of the proceeding and not with issues that may arise during the course of the
proceedings. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention differentiates between challenges based

on a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) (used by the Applicant for its

argument) and challenges based on the improper constitution of the tribunal under
Section 2 of Chapter IV, to which Article 52(1)(a) refers. Thus, a challenge based on the
lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) is not a ground for annulment under

Article 52(1)(a).2

b) In any event, the standard applicable to a challenge of an arbitrator is high and
is even higher at the annulment phase

66. If the Committee were to accept a more expansive interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) of the

ICSID Convention and allowed the application of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention

“under the guise of annulment”,** a view which the Eiser Parties do not support, the

Committee would have to do so “with the safeguards imposed by the Convention on the

standards of review for annulment”,

especially because the challenged arbitrator cannot

furnish any explanations.*>

67. Accordingly, the Committee must be satisfied, based on the evidence before it, that the
arbitrator in question failed to exercise independent judgment, that such failure was
“manifest” (i.e., evident or obvious) and that it put the integrity of the proceedings into
question. If all of these elements are met, the Committee must consider whether, in light
of the totality of the circumstances, it is appropriate to exercise its discretion to annul the
Award. In doing so, the Committee cannot reconsider the merits of the decisions taken in

the arbitration nor perform a de novo assessment of the facts.*®

Mr. Lapuerta acted as an independent expert was public knowledge years before the Award

was issued.’*

70. In the eyes of the Eiser Parties, the awards of PSEG v. Turkey, Pluspetrol v. Perupetro, and
Alapli v. Turkey, used by the Applicant as evidence that Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta
were engaged by the same party as counsel and expert, were issued in June 2004, January

2007, and May 2015, long before the Eiser Award was issued.*?

71. The Eiser Parties also emphasize that Global Arbitration Review (“GAR”) published an
article in May 2015, at the same time that the Underlying Arbitration was pending,
specifically stating that Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta were engaged by the respondent

in Pluspetrol v. Perupetro.°

September 2016. This information was therefore publicly available long before the Award

was issued.*!

Finally, Dr. Alexandrov’s curriculum vitae, which was provided to the Parties when he
was appointed, confirmed that he was currently or had recently represented, among others,
Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Peru, and Turkey. This declaration covered the cases of PSEG
v. Turkey, Pluspetrol v. Perupetro, and Bear Creek v. Peru and the information related to

such cases was already publicly available.**

Because of all this publicly available information, Spain should have known about the
relationship, especially in light of the duty of due diligence that the Parties have.*? By not
acting on information that Spain admits was available to it at the time, Spain has waived
its right to raise any objections regarding Dr. Alexandrov’s impartiality and

independence.™*

d) Dr. Alexandrov’s relationship with the Brattle Group does not warrant
disqualification

The Eiser Parties argue that experts are chosen and appointed by the clients and not by

counsel, and are engaged to provide their independent opinion. Therefore, a conflict

regarding an expert could only arise on the basis of the expert’s individual and close

relationship with an individual arbitrator.*°

In the case at hand, the Applicant has failed to objectively demonstrate Dr. Alexandrov’s
alleged bias because:” (i) it failed to show how Sidley Austin’s activities created a conflict;
(ii) the cases where Brattle worked alongside Sidley Austin do not create a conflict for
Dr. Alexandrov; (iii) Mr. Lapuerta and Dr. Alexandrov only had a professional relationship

that does not necessarily create a conflict; and (iv) previous tribunals have already decided

that Dr. Alexandrov’s relationship with Brattle does not constitute a ground for

disqualification.

77. First, the Eiser Parties argue that even though an arbitrator may be considered to bear the
identity of his law firm, the IBA Guidelines make it clear that the activities of an arbitrator’s
law firm should not automatically create a conflict of interest, and this should be assessed
on a case by case basis. According to the Eiser Parties, Spain has failed to explain how

Sidley Austin’s activities create a conflict in the present case.*”

78. Second, the cases in which experts from Brattle, other than Mr. Lapuerta, worked together
with lawyers from Sidley Austin do not support Dr. Alexandrov’s close personal

relationship with Mr. Lapuerta. These include:**

- Five ICSID cases where Mr. Lapuerta was not involved and that were handled by

Sidley Austin’s arbitration team in Washington D.C.;°°

- Four commercial arbitration cases handled in whole or in part by Sidley Austin’s

arbitration team in Washington D.C.;© and
- One investment arbitration case at the initial stages.°!

79. Third, Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta’s relationship was only “professional.” Over the

15-year period referred to by the Applicant, there have been only three ICSID cases and

one commercial arbitration in which Dr. Alexandrov was personally involved as counsel

and Mr. Lapuerta was appointed as an expert by the same party.

80. Out of these four cases, there is only one in which Dr. Alexandrov worked with
Mr. Lapuerta while the Underlying Arbitration was taking place, namely Pluspetrol
v. Perupetro. As recognized by the Secretary-General of the PCA, “concurrent service as
an arbitrator and as counsel in an unrelated matter in which the same expert has been
engaged does not automatically result in a conflict of interest warranting disqualification

under the ICSID Convention.”

81. For the Eiser Parties, the SolEs Badajoz and Tethyan Copper cases are irrelevant for
establishing the basis of any conflict because, in these cases, Dr. Alexandrov was acting as
an arbitrator and not as counsel.® Further, the Eiser Parties argue that the Applicant’s
description of the SolEs Badajoz case is misleading. While the unchallenged co-arbitrators
were equally divided on the matter, the Applicant cannot know without being privy to the
deliberations that one of the co-arbitrators believed that there were justifiable doubts

regarding Dr. Alexandrov’s impartiality.

82. In any event, even if the Committee concludes that Dr. Alexandrov’s engagements with
Mr. Lapuerta constituted a close professional relationship, such relationship does not

necessarily create a conflict.®” Dr. Alexandrov has further confirmed that his relationship

with the Brattle Group did not go beyond engaging them as experts and that he has not had

any other joint activities with Mr. Lapuerta or any other expert from Brattle.°*

Fourth, the Eiser Parties draw the Committee’s attention to the fact that in three different
instances, it has already been decided that Dr. Alexandrov’s relationship with Brattle does
not constitute a ground for disqualification. In fact, the very same issue that the Applicant
is presenting to the Committee was already decided in Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan. In that
case, it was decided that there was no manifest lack of impartiality on the part of

Dr. Alexandrov.

On this point, the Eiser Parties argue that the Applicant’s request to strike from the record
the decisions issued in the Tethyan Copper case should be rejected. The information
available on the ICSID website does not show that such decisions are subject to a
confidentiality order. In fact, the Eiser Parties contacted the counsel for the claimant in that

case and confirmed that such confidentiality order is not in place.”

In light of the foregoing, the Eiser Parties conclude that the Applicant has failed to
demonstrate that Dr. Alexandrov manifestly lacked independence or impartiality when

considering the evidence and facts of the Underlying Arbitration.”!

e) Failure to disclose does not automatically imply the lack of impartiality and
independence of an arbitrator

For the Eiser Parties, a lack of disclosure does not automatically imply the existence of a

lack of independence and impartiality.’* The obligation to disclose under ICSID

Arbitration Rule 6(2)(b) is a subjective standard. As such, it is for the arbitrator to exercise
his or her discretion whether to disclose a fact or circumstance. An arbitrator cannot be

criticized for honestly exercising that discretion.’*

87. According to the Eiser Parties, the existence of a professional relationship between an
expert and an arbitrator is not necessarily perceived as worthy of disclosure. In fact, none
of the applicable rules impose the duty on an arbitrator to disclose a professional
relationship with an independent expert.” Because of this, it is not unreasonable for
Dr. Alexandrov to have concluded that Mr. Lapuerta’s engagement as an expert did not
constitute a circumstance that required disclosure, and nothing in the Applicant’s
submissions suggest that the lack of disclosure was anything other than an honest exercise

of discretion. Thus, the Applicant’s case must fail.”>

A) There is no evidence of bias in this case

88. According to the Eiser Parties, even if the Committee decides to review de novo the request
to disqualify Dr. Alexandrov, it must reject Spain’s case because there is no manifest
appearance of bias or dependence. Spain has the burden to point to specific facts that
demonstrate bias, which it fails to do because its arguments are based on inferences and

speculation and not on objective evidence.”

89. Accordingly, unless the Applicant points to specific objective facts that demonstrate

Dr. Alexandrov’s bias in favor of the Brattle reports and that the case was decided on

90. According to the Eiser Parties, the Applicant only uses online articles to support its
position, which are not evidence of a “manifest” lack of independence or impartiality, and
has failed to provide further evidence on this issue.’8 In fact, the Award shows that the
Tribunal effectively scrutinized both sets of submissions, decided to make adjustments to
Mr. Lapuerta’s calculations on damages and even criticized Mr. Lapuerta’s opinion where
relevant.”? Further, the Award was adopted unanimously by all the Members of the
Tribunal and there is no reason to doubt Dr. Alexandrov’s independence and ability to

assess the merits of the case objectively.*”

B. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS
1. Spain’s Arguments

91. Spain contends that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers under
Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention by: (a) acting outside the Parties’ consent by
awarding compensation for measures over which it did not have jurisdiction or which it
found not to be in breach of the ECT; and (b) failing to apply the proper law in the Award’s

determination of liability.*!

a) The Tribunal acted beyond the scope of its jurisdiction by awarding €128 million
in compensation to the Eiser Parties
Spain contends that, by awarding €128 million to the Claimants, the Tribunal acted beyond

the scope of its authority and jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID Convention.*?

According to Spain, the measures which the Eiser Parties claimed had violated the ECT
were:*? (i) Law 15/2012; (ii) RDL 2/2013; (iii) RDL 9/2013; (iv) Law 24/2013;
(v) RD 413/2014; and (vi) MO IET/1045/2014 (the “Disputed Measures”). In the Award,
the Tribunal decided that it did not have jurisdiction over the 7% tax measure implemented
by Law 15/2012 and that Law 15/2012 and RDL 2/2013 did not violate the ECT, either

“individually or collectively.”**

During the Arbitration, the Eiser Parties and their damages expert, the Brattle Group,
argued that the appropriate methodology to calculate the economic impact of the Disputed
Measures was the DCF methodology.** The Brattle Group divided the damages between:
(i) the damages pertaining to the “historical” period prior to June 20, 2014 (i.e., when
MO IET/1045/2014 was published and whereby the “new regime” comprised of
RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013 and RD 413/2014 was implemented); and (ii) the damages
pertaining to the period after June 20, 2014 and up to the end of the life of the CSP Plants.*°

According to Spain, to calculate the damages, the Brattle Group compared the difference
in cash flows between the “But For” and the “Actual” scenarios. In the “But For” scenario,
the expert assumed that the RD 661/2007 regime remained unchanged for the entire

lifespan of the CSP Plants and that all the Disputed Measures constituted violations under

the ECT and, therefore, should be treated as if they were “never implemented.” In the

“Actual” scenario, the expert included the impact of all the Disputed Measures.*”

Spain argues that the Tribunal accepted this methodology with only one adjustment on the
CSP Plants’ lifespan.** This methodology, and therefore the Tribunal, assumed that all the
Disputed Measures warranted compensation, including those that did not violate the ECT.
As such, the damages awarded by the Tribunal did not reflect its findings on jurisdiction
and liability and were much higher than they should have been if the Tribunal had properly
adjusted the calculation.*® Spain concludes that this award of overstated damages amounts

to a manifest excess of powers.”

If the proper adjustments were made to the model presented by the Brattle Group, Spain
contends that the difference between the “But For” and the “Actual” scenarios would be
only €7 million and not €128 million.*! According to Spain, this new calculation is just

illustrative and is not new expert testimony.”
b) The Tribunal’s determination of liability constitutes a manifest excess of powers
because it failed to apply the proper law, as interpreted by the Tribunal

Spain contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply

Article 10(1) of the ECT.

Spain argues that, according to the Tribunal, it “had a sovereign right to regulate, including
the right to change the regulatory regime governing the renewable energy industry that had

been established under RD 661/2007, [...] the Eiser Parties had no right to stabilization of

that regime, [...] investment treaties such as the ECT did not abrogate the State’s right to
regulate, and [...] the fair and equitable treatment standard did not provide Claimants with
aright to regulatory stabilization.”*> However, despite these express findings, the Tribunal
also “found Spain liable for breach of fair and equitable treatment, and liable for damages,
precisely because Spain made revisions to the energy regulations that the Tribunal held it
had a right to revise and for which the Claimants had no right to stabilization.”* In Spain’s

view, this determination of liability amounted to a manifest excess of powers.”

100. Further, according to Spain, the Tribunal stated that it would only decide claims presented
under Article 10(1) of the ECT and that it would not decide claims related to expropriation
under the ECT on the ground of judicial and financial economy.”° The Tribunal decided
that Article 10(1) of the ECT sets the FET standard and that the relevant elements are those
of “stability” and “transparency.”®” However, Spain submits, the Tribunal never concluded
that the measures were adopted in a non-transparent manner and inexplicably analyzed the
FET claim under expropriation-based principles.** This constitutes, in Spain’s view,

a failure to apply the proper law and as such a manifest excess of powers.”

2. Eiser Parties’ Arguments

101. For the Eiser Parties, under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Spain has the burden
to prove that the Tribunal acted in excess of its powers, and that this excess is manifest or
plainly obvious.'®° According to them, for the annulment to be successful, the Committee
would be required to find that the Tribunal acted manifestly outside the scope of its

mandate in its jurisdictional analysis or in its determination of the applicable law (i.e., that

it failed to apply the proper law).!°! Annulment is not warranted in cases of an alleged
inappropriate award of damages or misapplication of the proper law, which is what the

Applicant alleges.'°?

a) The Tribunal committed no excess of powers with respect to its determination on
damages

In relation to the Tribunal’s quantification of damages, the Eiser Parties argue that: (i) the

arguments presented by the Applicant do not go to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction nor to the

failure to apply the applicable law, the only proper grounds for annulment;!°?

and, (ii) in
reality, Spain is trying to challenge the assessment of the evidence made by the Tribunal,
which is not a proper ground for annulment. They submit that reconsidering evidence falls

outside the powers of the Committee, which cannot serve as an appeal court.!™

On the first point, the Eiser Parties argue that the Tribunal correctly stated that the
applicable laws were the ECT and the rules of international law. Thereafter, the Tribunal

applied said laws in its determination of damages.!°°

On the second point, the Eiser Parties argue that: (1) Spain mischaracterizes the
conclusions of the Tribunal regarding damages; and, (2) Spain is trying to reargue its case

on damages by presenting a new quantum model that should be rejected.

The Eiser Parties do not dispute the list of measures presented by the Applicant nor the
conclusions reached by the Tribunal regarding such measures.'°° However, they argue that
the Tribunal did not award compensation as if all the Disputed Measures violated the

ECT."7 On the contrary, the Tribunal made specific deductions from the claimed damages

it also explained why its
calculation on damages was not affected by its lack of jurisdiction over the tax measure

calculations.!!°

According to the Eiser Parties, Spain disputes the deductions made by the Tribunal, which
in its view are not “the right adjustments.”''! Spain is attempting to re-argue its case on
damages by advancing a new model that was never presented to the Tribunal, and which
Spain could have presented with its Rejoinder.!!? This new model is now presented without
leave from the Committee and in violation of the instructions established in Procedural

Order 1.''3 As such, this new model should be disregarded by the Committee.!!4

b) The Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and applied it

In relation to the Tribunal’s determinations on liability and the FET standard, the Eiser
Parties argue that all the Committee must do is to assess whether the Tribunal correctly

identified the applicable law and applied it, which it did.!'>

The Eiser Parties argue that Spain mischaracterized the Tribunal’s findings in relation to
the FET standard. According to them, the Tribunal found that: (i) Spain has a right to
regulate but it is not unfettered and may trigger a breach of the FET standard that requires

compensation; and (ii) stability and transparency, while not absolute requirements, are

critical components of the FET standard that can be used to establish a breach.!'® It was
based on this, they submit, that the Tribunal found that Spain had “crossed the line”, that
the measures were disproportionate, and that Spain was required to compensate the Eiser

Parties for violation of the FET standard.!!”

In addition, the Eiser Parties argue that it is incorrect to conclude that the Tribunal applied
an “expropriation-based analysis.”''’ The Eiser Parties further argue that, “in any event,
the destructive nature of a state’s measure on an investment can be as relevant to assessing
an FET breach as to assessing whether an indirect expropriation has taken place.”!!°
According to the Eiser Parties, Spain ignores its own submissions that the Tribunal should
consider the economic impact of the Disputed Measures and their proportionality as part

of the FET standard.!7°

Further, for the Eiser Parties, Spain ignores the Tribunal’s clear and extensive analysis
throughout the Award explaining how a State’s obligation to provide stability can be
breached as a result of drastic regulatory changes, notwithstanding the impact on value.
Stability was at the heart of the Tribunal’s decision that the FET standard had been
breached.'?! Also, the Tribunal set out many “other facts that led to its finding of a FET

breach, none of which relate to deprivation in value of the Investments.”!2?

Cc. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE

may be annulled if “there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure.” This requires that the departure be: (a) “serious”; and, (b) from a
“fundamental” rule of procedure.'?* For the Applicant, this test is the same as the “three-
limb test” proposed by the Eiser Parties since the additional requirement - the existence of

a departure - is implied in this two-tier test.!7*

112. On the one hand, for a departure to be “serious”, it must have had or may have had a
material effect on the tribunal’s decision.!?> According to the Applicant, contrary to the
Eiser Parties’ contention, evidence of an “actual material prejudice” and the showing that
the violation created a substantially different result are not required.'?° On the other hand,
the term “fundamental rule of procedure” refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure
that must be respected and includes the right to an independent and impartial tribunal, and

the right for the parties to be heard and to be treated equally.'?7

113. Accordingly, the Applicant argues that the Award should be annulled under
Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention because: (a) the Tribunal lacked independence

and impartiality; and (b) Spain was denied the right to be heard and to be treated equally.!78

a) The Tribunal lacked independence and impartiality

114. The Applicant argues that, because of the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and the

129

Brattle Group and the failure to disclose such relationship,'~’ it was deprived of the

opportunity to have its case heard and decided by a tribunal composed of three independent
and impartial individuals. This stripped the Applicant of the protection afforded by the

fundamental right to be heard by an independent and impartial tribunal. The Award should

therefore be annulled.'*?

b) Spain was denied the right to be heard and to be treated equally

115. According to the Applicant, the right to be heard encompasses different protections
including: (i) the right to submit arguments and evidence that it deems relevant to support
its case, and to do so with a comparatively equal opportunity to that given to the other
party;!*! (ii) the right to respond to the arguments and evidence submitted by the other

party, including the right to make submissions when new evidence is received and

and (iii) not being unjustifiably denied a request for document
production, especially when the tribunal, after denying such request, concludes that there

was an absence of evidence on the matter.!*3

The Applicant thus argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from its fundamental right

to be heard when it took the below listed decisions.!*4

The Tribunal allowed the Eiser Parties, during the Hearing, to submit new documents into
the record, one of which was used by Brattle as a basis for its new damages calculations
presented for the first time at the Hearing. Despite the Applicant’s objections, the Tribunal
allowed this, failed to give a reasonable opportunity to the Applicant to rebut this new

material, and relied on such calculations in its determination of damages in the Award.!*5

The Tribunal denied the Applicant’s request for the production of documents regarding the
costs of the CSP Plants, through which it intended to demonstrate that the costs were
inflated. Even though the Tribunal denied this request, it made material findings in the
Award regarding the investment costs, stated that there was no serious dispute concerning
the amounts and decided that Spain had not proved that such costs were inflated. All of this
had an important impact on the Tribunal’s determinations on the economic effect of the

“new regime.”!°°

ultimately relied on the RREEF award to dismiss the Applicant’s intra-EU objection.”

120. Finally, the Tribunal rejected the EC’s requests to file written submissions as a non-
disputing party. The Tribunal rejected the first request and then conditioned the grant of
subsequent requests on the EC’s provision of a cost undertaking. Such decision denied
Spain the benefit of the EC’s intervention, which would have provided the Tribunal with
authoritative clarification and confirmation of Spain’s obligations as an EU Member

2. Eiser Parties’ Arguments

121. According to the Eiser Parties, for an award to be annulled under Article 52(1)(d), it is
required that: (a) the procedural rule alleged to be violated be “fundamental”; (b) there be
a departure from such rule; and, (c) the departure be “serious.” Not every departure from a

rule of procedure justifies the annulment of an award.!°°

122. For the Eiser Parties, there are two different positions that have been adopted regarding
what constitutes a “serious” departure. One position, favored by the Eiser Parties, requires
the existence of actual material prejudice and a showing that the violation has caused a
“substantially different result.”'4° The other position, favored by the Applicant, is that it is

sufficient to demonstrate a “potential effect” of the departure on the award.'*! For the Eiser

Parties, under either position, Article 52(1)(d) requires a departure that is outcome-

determinative.!”

a) The Tribunal did not lack independence and impartiality

The Eiser Parties do not dispute that the right to an independent and impartial arbitrator is
a fundamental rule of procedure. They argue, however, that the other two elements of the
test — a “departure” that is “serious” - are not fulfilled.'4* According to the Eiser Parties,
there is no departure from such a rule because Spain has not adduced any evidence that

proves a manifest lack of independence and impartiality on the part of Dr. Alexandrov.'*

In addition, even if there was a departure from a fundamental rule, the Applicant has failed
to show that it may have had an impact on the Award. The Applicant has not submitted
any objective evidence that demonstrates that the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and
Brattle, and/or its non-disclosure, may have caused the Tribunal to reach a substantially

different result than the one it would have otherwise reached.'45

b) There are no grounds to annul the Award on the basis of the rights to be heard
and to be treated equally

The Eiser Parties do not contest that the right to be heard has been recognized as a

fundamental rule of procedure. However, for the annulment to proceed, it must be

unequivocally and objectively established that a tribunal has violated this right. As such,

this right is not violated when a party does not avail itself of the opportunity to be heard

that was granted to it and does not preclude the Tribunal’s discretion to admit and evaluate

evidence. Similarly, the right to be treated equally is not violated when a request for

document production is denied and does not require the parties to have been granted an

equal number of requests.'4°

For the Eiser Parties, none of the contentions of the Applicant come even close to
constituting a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. With respect to the

specific allegations, the Eiser Parties offered the following response.”

The Eiser Parties’ application to introduce nine new documents in the arbitration was based
on Spain’s belated submission of its DCF calculation, which was made with Spain’s
Rejoinder on the Merits. Moreover, the Applicant fails to mention that it consented to the
introduction of four of the documents and that, in any event, all the documents complied
with the safeguards imposed by the Tribunal to ensure that the Applicant had the
opportunity and time to consider the new documents.'** Further, the Applicant has failed
to show that the introduction of the documents had a material impact on the outcome of the
case, especially given that the alleged depreciation error was not dispositive or even highly

material to the outcome of the arbitration.'?

Further, the Applicant conflates two different concepts: (i) the amounts invested by the
Eiser Parties to purchase the shareholding interest in the holding companies that own the
CSP Plants; and (ii) the actual investment costs incurred to construct and operate the
CSP Plants in Spain. Regarding the first category, the Tribunal was correct in stating that
there was no dispute since these amounts were based on documents provided by the Eiser
Parties and never contested by the Applicant. Regarding the second category, the Applicant

never articulated the precise relevance of its arguments regarding the alleged inflated

construction costs and, in any case, the Tribunal expressly rejected the valuation method

based on such investment costs.!*°

The Tribunal’s decisions regarding the RREEF and the Isolux awards were based on the
specific circumstances of each request. Apart from the fact that the request to admit the
RREEF award was made shortly after it became available and decided after both parties
had the opportunity to comment, the ultimate decision to reject the introduction of the
Isolux decision was based on Spain’s failure to confirm that the claimant in the Jsolux case

had consented to the disclosure of the award.!*!

Finally, the Tribunal’s decision to reject the EC’s amicus curiae brief was a result of the
EC’s own choice not to provide the requested undertaking. Pursuant to the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal was entitled to request such an undertaking to guarantee

152 Tp

that the EC’s submission would not unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party.
any event, there is no fundamental right to amicus curiae submissions that would support
a party’s position and the failure to submit an amicus curiae brief is by no means

“serious.”!53

D. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS

Spain recalls that under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, an award may be
annulled if the tribunal “has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.”'** Pursuant to

Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, a reader must be able to follow how

the tribunal went from Point A to Point B, and the reasons given shall not be contradictory

or frivolous.!°

According to Spain, the Award should be annulled because: (a) the award of damages
contradicts the Tribunal’s own reasoning and determinations on jurisdiction and
liability;!°° (b) the award of damages contradicts the Tribunal’s finding that Spain had a
sovereign right to regulate;'*’ (c) the Tribunal had no basis to conclude that the economic
impact of the “new system” was more drastic than that of the “old system”;!** and (d) the
Tribunal relied on the destruction of value of the investment as a basis to find an FET

violation.!?

a) The award of damages contradicts the Tribunal’s own reasoning and
determinations on jurisdiction and liability

As stated in Section III.B.1.a) of this Decision, Spain argues that the Tribunal adopted a

calculation of damages that assumed that all the Disputed Measures violated the ECT. This

finding ignored the Tribunal’s decision that some of the measures did not violate the ECT

and/or were outside its jurisdiction. According to Spain, it is impossible to follow how

the Tribunal went from its finding that not all measures were FET violations to its award

of damages, with the latter suggesting that all the Disputed Measures were wrongful.'°!

b) The award of damages contradicts the Tribunal’s finding that Spain had a
sovereign right to regulate

As indicated in Section III.B.1.b) of this Decision, Spain argues that the Tribunal found

that the Claimants had not been given any stabilization guarantees and that Spain had a

Tribunal’s reasoning. '©* For the Applicant, it is impossible to follow how the Tribunal went
from the absence of stabilization guarantees to the award of damages assuming that the

regulatory regime of RD 661/2007 would remain unchanged.'™

c) The Tribunal had no basis to conclude that the economic impact of the “new
system” was more drastic than that of the “old system”
According to Spain, the Tribunal concluded that the measures adopted by Spain prior to
June 2014 did not constitute FET violations whereas the “new regime” breached
Article 10(1) of the ECT because it introduced a “drastic” change.'® To reach this
conclusion, Spain submits, the Tribunal needed to identify the effect of each individual
measure and compare the effect of the “old regime” vis-a-vis the “new regime.”!°°
However, the Tribunal reached its conclusion without any basis, without doing such

comparison, without the necessary evidence, and without asking for additional evidence.!
d) The Tribunal relied on the destruction of value of the investment as a basis to
find an FET violation

As mentioned in Section III.B.1.b) of this Decision, Spain takes issue with the fact that the
Tribunal used an expropriation-based approach in its analysis of the violation of the FET

standard. According to Spain, the Tribunal did not state the reasons for starting from the

position that the fundamental element of the FET standard is “stability”, and then using a

destruction-of-value approach to find a violation of the FET standard.!®

2. Eiser Parties’ Arguments

137. The Eiser Parties emphasize that the threshold for annulment is high. In their view, “a
tribunal is only required to state any reason for its conclusions, sufficient to allow a
committee to follow the reasons for the decision: mere disagreement with the tribunal’s
reasoning is not grounds for annulment.”'® The Committee should seek to construe the
language of any award in a way that results in consistency as opposed to finding

contradictions.!””

138. For the Eiser Parties, Spain has the burden of demonstrating that the Tribunal’s reasoning
is “‘unintelligible or contradictory or frivolous or absent’ and that such defect is
compelling from the face of the Award.”!7! Spain, the Eiser Parties submit, has failed to
discharge such burden.'”? With this in mind, the Eiser Parties reject the arguments

presented by Spain in relation to the alleged failure to state reasons.'7*

139. First, the Eiser Parties argue that the Tribunal gave reasons and explained precisely how it
reached the damages figure it awarded to them. It considered its findings on liability when
making the adjustments to such award on damages.!™ In reality, Spain is seeking

annulment not because there is a contradiction in the Award’s reasoning, but because it

disagrees with the conclusions reached by the Tribunal.'”°

Second, the Eiser Parties argue that the Tribunal did not contradict its findings on
liability.'”° Spain ignores the Tribunal’s findings that the right to regulate and the right to
stability are not absolute, and that stability and transparency are critical components of the
FET standard. That is why the Tribunal was able to conclude (a) that a “fundamental
change to the regulatory regime [...] in a manner that does not take account of the
circumstances of existing investments” will breach the FET standard, and, (b) ultimately,
that Spain owed compensation to the Eiser Parties.'’’ The Tribunal’s careful and detailed
analysis focused on the degree of change in the regulatory framework and there can be no
doubt that the Tribunal provided a clear and easy-to-follow reasoning when finding a

breach of the FET standard.'”8

Third, the Eiser Parties argue that Spain disagrees with the Tribunal’s factual findings,
something that is not relevant to any annulment standard in annulment proceedings.!”
In any case, the Eiser Parties consider that the Tribunal looked at the economic impact of
Spain’s measures on the Eiser Parties’ investments to determine that the Disputed
Measures were disproportionate and clearly stated the reasons for finding a breach of the
FET standard.'*° To do so, the Tribunal compared the fundamental assumptions and

features of the original regime with those of the post-June 2014 regulatory regime.'*!

Fourth, according to the Eiser Parties, the Tribunal did not improperly apply an
“expropriation-based analysis” in finding an FET breach. In their view, in any event, and
as the Tribunal explained, “the destructive nature of a state’s measure on an investment can
be as relevant to assessing an FET breach as [it is] to assessing whether an indirect

expropriation has taken place.”!*?

Iv. ANALYSIS OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE

For the reasons provided below, the Committee has concluded that the Award must be
annulled on the following grounds: (A) improper constitution of the Tribunal
(Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention); and (B) serious departure from a fundamental
tule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).

A. IMPROPER CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

This section will set forth the reasons for which the Committee has concluded that the
Tribunal was improperly constituted. This section is divided as follows: (1) the Committee
will first interpret the provisions of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, in
accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna
Convention”), and determine whether a tribunal may be held to have been improperly
constituted where an arbitrator lacked independence or impartiality; (2) the Committee will
then determine what standard ought to be applied under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID
Convention where an application for annulment is made on the basis that an arbitrator
lacked independence or impartiality and no proposal for disqualification had been made
before the proceeding was declared closed. Similar to the EDF committee, this Committee
will apply a three-step test and determine (a) whether the Applicant has waived the right
to raise the issue because it had, allegedly, not raised it sufficiently promptly; and
(b) whether the standard for disqualification is met. In a separate section, in its analysis on
the seriousness of the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Committee will
address the third step of the test and determine whether the alleged lack of independence

or impartiality could have had a material impact on the Award.!**

1. Interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention

a) Spain’s Arguments

Spain submits that a party may seek the annulment of an award under Article 52(1)(a) of
the ICSID Convention if the tribunal was “not properly constituted”, which covers the
situation in which a member of the tribunal lacked the qualities of independence and

impartiality.'*

In Spain’s view, this is confirmed by: (a) the Updated Background Paper on Annulment,
which explains that under this provision “[t]he parties may raise an objection concerning
compliance with [the provisions of Chapter I of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, entitled
‘Establishment of the Tribunal’]”;'®> and (b) the committee in EDF v. Argentina, which
stated that Article 52(1)(a) must be understood as referring to the requirements of
Chapter IV, Section 2 of the ICSID Convention (“Constitution of the Tribunal”). These
provisions regarding the “constitution of tribunal”, in turn, include all those qualities that

an arbitrator must possess.'*°

Article 40 of the ICSID Convention, which is also part of Chapter IV, Section 2 of the same
instrument, establishes that arbitrators “shall possess the qualities stated in paragraph (1)
of Article 14.” According to the Applicant, it is well stablished that Article 14 of the ICSID
Convention includes the qualities of impartiality and independence.'*’ Therefore, if an

arbitrator did not possess the qualities of Article 14, including those of independence and

impartiality, the tribunal was not properly constituted and, therefore, the award might be

annulled under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.'**

The Applicant rejects the Eiser Parties’ argument that Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID
Convention is only applicable to procedural deficiencies regarding the constitution of the
tribunal at the outset of the arbitration.'*° For the Applicant, this interpretation ignores the
content of Chapter IV, Section 2 of the ICSID Convention and the ordinary meaning of the

provisions contained therein.'””

The Applicant argues that Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention deals with the
substantive qualities that arbitrators must possess throughout the proceedings, including
those of independence and impartiality.'°! This is confirmed by ICSID Arbitration Rule 6,
which requires arbitrators to assume a continuing obligation to promptly notify the
Secretary-General of any relationship or circumstance that may bear upon the “reliability
for independent judgment.” If the arbitrator’s independence and impartiality was only

relevant at the outset of the case, there would be no need for this continuing obligation.!°

The Applicant’s position is unaffected by the fact that Dr. Alexandrov would be unable to
furnish explanations regarding his relationship with the Brattle Group during the annulment
proceeding. According to Spain, its right to the independence and impartiality of all the

members of the Tribunal simply “cannot be lost on that basis.”!

b) Eiser Parties’ Arguments

The Eiser Parties disagree with the Applicant’s interpretation and argue that

Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention only covers the procedural steps to constitute the

tribunal at the outset of the proceedings. For them, if the grounds for disqualification
became known after the award was rendered, then the appropriate remedy is to seek

revision of the award.!4

They argue that the Applicant’s broad interpretation is not consistent with the ordinary
meaning of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, as interpreted in accordance with
the Vienna Convention.'* A plain reading of this provision does not allow the Committee
to consider a disqualification proposal at the annulment stage “because the Convention
expressly treats the challenges based on the ‘improper constitution’ and challenges based

on the alleged lack of independence or impartiality separately.”!°°

Article 52(1)(a) must be read together with Chapter IV, Section 2 of the Convention
(“Constitution of the Tribunal”) which addresses, among other things, the process to be
followed to constitute the tribunal at the outset of the proceedings. This section does not
address issues that would arise during the course of the proceeding and that would warrant
the disqualification of the arbitrator; these issues are dealt in Chapter V of the
Convention.'*’ Further, Article 57 of the ICSID Convention expressly differentiates
between challenges based on a manifest lack of qualities required by Article 14(1) (which
is what Spain claims) and challenges based on the improper constitution of the tribunal
under Section 2 of Chapter IV, which is what Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention

refers to.!8

For the Eiser Parties, when the facts on which a challenge is based became known after the
award was rendered, the appropriate remedy is the revision of the award in accordance with

Article 51 of the ICSID Convention. Thus, the Applicant should seek the revision of the

Award and not its annulment, which will also allow Dr. Alexandrov to furnish

explanations.'?

155. The Eiser Parties criticize the decision of the EDF committee, relied upon by Spain, for
erring in the interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention. According to them,
the EDF decision failed to address the drafting history of the ICSID Convention.” It is
also inconsistent since, one the one hand, it concluded that challenges to the independence
and impartiality of an arbitrator should be heard by the remaining members of the tribunal
and, on the other hand, still rejected that the revision is the appropriate remedy.”°!

In addition, the EDF decision is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Convention

and with the role of the annulment committee, which should not undertake a de novo review

as if it were an arbitral tribunal assessing the merits of a disqualification proposal.?

ce) Analysis of the Committee

156. The Parties are in disagreement as to the correct interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) of the
ICSID Convention. The Committee will interpret this provision in accordance with the
customary rules of interpretation, as reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.
Accordingly, the Committee will interpret Article 52(1)(a) in light of its (1) text;
(2) context; (3) object and purpose; and, (4) in light of any relevant rules of international

law applicable in the relations between the Parties.2°*

(1) Text of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention

Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention states:

(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an
application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or
more of the following grounds:

(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;

[ed

 

Beginning with the text, the words “was” and “constituted” indicate a sentence in passive
voice, which by its nature emphasizes the interest in the person or object that experiences
an action i.e., in this case the Tribunal. “Constitute” means “[b]e (a part) of a whole; [g]ive
legal or constitutional form to (an institution); establish by law.”?°* “Properly” means
“[cJorrectly or satisfactorily.””°° It is significant that the phrase is in the past tense. This is
not without reason. It is the view of this Committee that the phrase is in the past tense
because annulment is sought after the relevant grounds, relied upon, have arisen. The
Spanish text of Article 52(1)(a) reads “que el Tribunal se hubiere constituido
incorrectamente.” In the Spanish version, “constituir” means “[f]ormar, componer, ser
[...] [e]stablecer, erigir, fundar [...] Constituirse EN tribunal’, but also “[d]icho de un
tribunal [...] [rleunirse o congregarse.”?® The French text reads as follows: “Chacune des
parties peut demander, par écrit, au Secrétaire général l'annulation de la sentence pour
l'un quelconque des motifs suivants: (a) vice dans la constitution du Tribunal.” The plain
meaning of the words and the corresponding Spanish and French texts do not suggest that
the expression “properly constituted” is restricted to “the initial formation of a given

body.”?°7 Given their plain meaning and read in their proper context they mean that the

Tribunal must have not only been correctly formed, initially, but must have also continued
to remain so for the duration of its existence. This Committee is aware of observations to
the contrary, of another committee,” but in view of the plain meaning of the words as well
as the context in which they are used, it is inclined to take a different view. Further reasons

for this conclusion and for not following the observations of the other committee follow.”

(2) Context of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention

As summarized in Sections IV.A.1.a) and IV.A.1.b) above, the Parties have based their
interpretations of Article 52(1)(a) on different provisions of the ICSID Convention. The
Parties disagree as to whether annulment can be sought for improper constitution of the
tribunal where a party alleges a lack of impartiality or independence on the part of an
arbitrator and whether revision is the appropriate remedy in the case at hand. The

Committee will address the Parties’ contextual arguments below.

In their proper context, as used in Article 52(1)(a), the words “properly constituted” cannot
be said to be referring only to the initial constitution of a tribunal. This Committee notes
that other clauses of paragraph (1) of Article 52 also refer to actions which take place in
the past. In all those cases, as well, if any one or more of the grounds mentioned in

paragraph (1) of Article 52 are established, the award can be annulled by a committee.

Further, Article 52 itself ought to be read in the context of the Convention. This provision
is embedded in Chapter IV of the Convention. That “the Tribunal was not properly
constituted” is a ground on which a party can base its application for annulment of an
award, under clause (a) of paragraph (1) of Article 52. Section 2, which too, is a part of
Chapter IV is titled “Constitution of the Tribunal.” Section 2 consists of four articles i.e.,
Articles 37 to 40. Article 37 calls for a swift constitution of the tribunal after registration
of a request for arbitration, and provides the number of arbitrators. Article 38 establishes
the timeline for appointment of arbitrators; the process to be followed in case an arbitrator
or arbitrators are not appointed; and the rules on nationality. Article 39 also provides rules

on nationality of arbitrators and when these can be waived by agreement of the parties.

163.

Article 40 provides when arbitrators may be appointed from outside the “Panel of
Arbitrators” but makes clear that they must nevertheless “possess the qualities stated in
paragraph (1) of Article 14” required of persons “designated to serve on the Panels.” The
qualifications provided for persons designated to serve on the Panels of Arbitrators,
therefore, apply with equal force to arbitrators appointed from outside the Panels of

Arbitrators. According to paragraph (1) of Article 14, these qualifications are as follows:

(1) Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of
high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of
law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to
exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall
be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of
Arbitrators.

The Committee notes the difference between the Spanish and English texts of paragraph (1)
of Article 14. Whilst the English text reads, “may be relied upon to exercise independent
judgment”, the Spanish version uses the words “inspirar plena confianza en su
imparcialidad de juicio” which may be translated into English as “to inspire full confidence
in their impartiality of judgment.”?!° Earlier, other committees have observed that this
requirement encompasses two qualities: independence and impartiality. This Committee

cites with approval the observations of the EDF committee:?!!

[...] the general practice has been to require that arbitrators may be
relied upon to exercise independent judgment and inspire full
confidence in their impartiality.?!?

In light of the above, not only the failure to comply with the requirements set forth in
Articles 37 to 40 but also the failure to “exercise independent judgment” or a lack of

impartiality would amount to “improper constitution.” Any doubt in this regard is dispelled

210 The French version is very similar to the English text: “offrir toute garantie d’indépendance dans l’exercice de
leurs fonctions.”

by paragraph (2) of Article 40. As stated above, it incorporates, by reference, the same
qualifications, for arbitrators appointed “from outside the Panel of Arbitrators” as are
required, under Article 14 of the ICSID Convention, of individuals designated on the Panel

of Arbitrators. Prof. Schreuer expresses this as follows:

Art. 14(1) describes the qualifications of individuals who may be
designated to serve on the Panel of Arbitrators [...] the individuals
must be persons of high moral character who may be relied upon to
exercise their independent judgment. Under Art. 40(2) even
arbitrators appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators must
possess these qualities. Appointment of an arbitrator who manifestly
does not possess these qualities may be put forward as a ground for
annulment [...].2!°

This view of the Committee is reinforced by the language of paragraph (1) of Article 54.
It mandates that each Contracting State shall recognize an award as binding and enforce
the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award as if it were a final judgment of a Court
in that State. This commitment by the Contracting States is predicated upon the imperative
that awards be rendered in full compliance with fundamental and basic norms of justice

such as the independence and impartiality of tribunals.

The Eiser Parties argue that their interpretation is supported by Article 57 of the
Convention. This Article, according to them, distinguishes between a disqualification
based on challenges to the qualities required of an arbitrator under paragraph (1) of
Article 14, on the one hand, and the ineligibility of an arbitrator under Section 2 of
Chapter IV, on the other.?'* According to the Eiser Parties, this provides contextual support
to the distinction between challenges based on eligibility and qualification. They submit
that the qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14 cannot, therefore, provide a ground

for annulment.

Article 57 speaks about “disqualification” of an arbitrator “on account of any fact
indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14” and “in

addition” also speaks about “disqualification” of an arbitrator on the ground that he was

3 Ex. CL-0295, Schreuer et al., THE ICSID CONVENTION, p. 936, {{ 123.
‘4 Annulment Rejoinder, {| 32-33.

 

Sl

“ineligible” for appointment to a tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV. The Committee
notes that in Article 57 the word “disqualification” is used when referring to the “manifest
lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.” It further notes that the same
word “disqualification” is also used in cases where an arbitrator is “ineligible” for

appointment under Section 2 of Chapter IV.

167. It is the view of the Committee that both where an arbitrator “manifestly lacks the qualities”
required under Article 14(1) as well as where he or she is “ineligible” for appointment
under Section 2 of Chapter IV, the consequence is the same i.e., “disqualification.” This
Committee is not inclined to, therefore, accept the submission of the Eiser Parties that a

failure to exercise “independent judgment”,?!>

as required by paragraph (1) of Article 14,
cannot be a ground of annulment. In the view of this Committee, a tribunal cannot be held
to be “properly constituted” under Article 52(1)(a) where an arbitrator, whose ability to
exercise independent judgment is in doubt, is either appointed to, or continues to be a

member of, a tribunal.

168. The requirement that a tribunal be properly constituted is not confined to the time of the
appointment of arbitrators, i.e. the constitution of a tribunal. It is a continuing requirement.
It begins with the constitution of the tribunal and ends only when the proceedings culminate
in a decision or award making the tribunal functus officio. From the time of his or her
appointment until he or she becomes functus officio an arbitrator must exercise independent
judgment and be impartial. A failure in this regard would impact the proper constitution of

the tribunal and form a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a).

169. The Committee further notes that this distinction also appears to be related more to the
timing of requesting the disqualification than to the difference between challenges. When
Article 57 is invoked the case is already ongoing. Thus, the rationale seems to be that a
party may challenge an arbitrator based on a lack of qualities required by paragraph (1) of
Article 14 but “in addition” it has an opportunity to seek disqualification of the arbitrator

if he or she was “ineligible” when appointed under Section 2 of Chapter IV. Article 57,

 

215

The Committee has already observed that in the context that the words “independent judgment” are used and on an
examination of the English and Spanish texts, it is clear that these words include a requirement of impartiality.

52

thus, confirms the close relation between Section 2 of Chapter IV and paragraph (1) of

Article 14.

170. |The Committee now turns to the argument raised by the Eiser Parties according to which
the proper remedy that the Applicant should seek is the revision of the Award and not its
annulment. The Committee has already concluded that the Applicant can seek the
annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(a) (improper constitution of the tribunal) due
to the alleged lack of independence or impartiality of one of the Tribunal’s members. Thus,
there is no need for the Committee to decide whether revision would be an appropriate
remedy in the case at hand. However, in light of the arguments raised by the Eiser Parties,

the Committee will briefly address this issue below.

171. Revision and annulment are different remedies available to the parties under different
circumstances. Revision of the award under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention provides
a remedy where “some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award [is
discovered], provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the
Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant’s ignorance of that fact was not due to
negligence.” It is a re-adjudication of the merits of the dispute in light of new facts. It is,
therefore, considered by the same tribunal. If the tribunal concludes that the unknown fact
was of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, the tribunal issues a decision revising
the award and this decision becomes part of the award for the purposes of recognition and

enforcement.”!©

172. By contrast, the focus of the annulment remedy under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention
is not the merits or the substance of the award. It “was designed purposefully to confer a
limited scope of review which would safeguard against ‘violation of the fundamental

principles of law governing the Tribunal’s proceedings.””?!”

216 Article 53(2) of the ICSID Convention.
217 Ex, C0299, Updated Background Paper on Annulment, { 71.

53

173. Although the Eiser Parties have argued on the basis of previous decisions that revision and
disqualification are the preferable remedy in cases such as the present, they have not been
able to satisfactorily explain why a serious challenge to the independence or impartiality
of an arbitrator falls outside the scope of paragraph (1) of Article 52.7'* This Committee
has difficulty accepting as correct the submission that it cannot examine a challenge to the
impartiality and independence of an arbitrator which affects the integrity of the proceedings
or the validity or legitimacy of an award. Such an interpretation, in the view of this

Committee, would be clearly contrary to the mandate of Article 52 as recalled above.

174. | Finally, the Committee is not persuaded by the argument that revision would be the proper

remedy on the ground that an arbitrator “has no means to provide his perspective against

27219

allegations of his bias and partiality”*!’ at the annulment phase, the way she or he would

have in the Underlying Arbitration had there been a disqualification proceeding. It is the
view of this Committee that this procedure is not required in annulment proceedings
because annulment committees have no authority to disqualify arbitrators from serving in
an arbitration that has already concluded or to propose any action with regard to their
conduct. All that the Committee is authorized to do is to annul the award if satisfied that
the conduct was such that it constituted a ground of annulment under Article 52. The
various remedies provided by the ICSID Convention flow from different objectives and
rationales. Revision is aimed at ensuring that if some fact, which was unknown to the
tribunal and the applicant before the award was rendered, is later discovered, the tribunal

ought to have an opportunity to correct it. Ordinarily this remedy would be available where

?!8 Neither the drafting history of the Convention, nor earlier decisions (nor the Eiser Parties) indicate whether revision
alone would be the remedy or whether revision and disqualification should be combined. Aaron Broches said during
the negotiation of the Convention that “[...] if the grounds for disqualification only became known after the award
was rendered, this would be a new fact which would enable a revision of the award.” (Ex. CL-0299, History of the
ICSID Convention: Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, Vol. II-2 (ICSID: 2006), p. 872). As pointed out
by the Eiser Parties, the request for revision would be submitted to the original tribunal, including the arbitrator whose
impartiality is called into question by one of the parties. This means that this arbitrator would be called upon to rule
on the request for revision although his/her alleged lack of impartiality is at the very heart of the request (it would be
the alleged new “fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award” (Art. 51 of the ICSID Convention). Finally,
the split advocated by the Eiser Parties between annulment and revision to deal with criticisms related to the arbitral
tribunal would lack economy and efficiency in the absence of a coordination between these two remedies in the ICSID
Convention.

219 Annulment Rejoinder, 4 45.

 

54

fraud or material suppression of facts, by a party, has resulted in an award different from
what it would otherwise have been. Revision is, thus, primarily concerned with the
substance of the award. The primary concern of annulment is to protect the integrity of the
proceedings. Its object is to safeguard procedural justice as encapsulated in the sub-
paragraphs of Article 52, paragraph 1. The arbitrator not having the means to put his or her
perspective before the Committee, in annulment proceedings, is, therefore, of little

consequence.

(3) Object and Purpose of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention

 

175. With respect to object and purpose of the text, features such as the finality of awards,
exclusion of appeals, and the exceptional nature of the annulment remedy may be among
those that inform the role of annulment committees.?”° As other committees have observed,
the role of an annulment committee relates to “procedural legitimacy”,””! “the legitimacy
of the award,”?? and “safeguard[ing] the integrity” of the proceedings and the award.”
Thus, while agreeing with the Eiser Parties about the “limited scope” of the annulment

24

procedure,” this Committee holds that there can be no greater threat to the legitimacy and

integrity of the proceedings or of the award than the lack of impartiality or independence

of one or more of the arbitrators. As the Suez committee stated:

In this regard, the Committee agrees with Respondent that the
parties’ confidence in the independence and impartiality of the
arbitrators deciding their case is essential for ensuring the integrity
of the proceedings and the dispute resolution mechanism as such;

thus, in principle, a lack of the qualities in Article 14(1) may serve
as ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a).??°

(4) Interpretation in accordance with any relevant rules of international law applicable to
the relations between the parties

176. |The Committee has already observed that, on its proper interpretation, Article 52(1)(a) of
the ICSID Convention establishes the right of the parties to an independent and impartial
tribunal. That right arises from the time a tribunal is constituted and continues throughout
its life.

177. Neither Party has referred to Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention in their

respective submissions. The Committee, however, refers to it and the relevant
jurisprudence here to show that its analysis of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention is
consistent with the requirements of the Vienna Convention. Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna
Convention provides that, together with the context, any relevant rules of international law
that are applicable in the relation between the parties shall be taken into account. The right
to an independent and impartial tribunal has been recognized as a general principle of
law.?7 As such, the right to an independent and impartial tribunal is a relevant rule of
international law which the Committee had to take into account when interpreting the

meaning of “improper constitution” under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.

178. Thus, in light of the text, context and object and purpose of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID
Convention, this Committee concludes that, for purposes of determining whether the
Tribunal was properly constituted, it has the authority to examine whether the members of

the Tribunal were and remained (and were seen to be/remain) impartial and independent

5 Ex, RL-0103, Suez v. Argentina, Decision on Annulment, J 77.

6 As the Committee had arrived at its interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention without any
reference to Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention it did not consider it necessary to invite any additional
submi ns from the Parties in this regard.

227

 

See Bin Cheng, a “judge must not only be impartial, but there must be no possibility of suspecting his impartiality”
(General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals, 1953, p. 289) and Kotuby/Sobota, “[...]
an impartial and independent judge has long been a fundamental tenet of international due process. [...] Today nearly
every nation provides in its written law for an independent judiciary. That consensus has been mirrored on the
international plane, too, as intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations have expressly recognized judicial
impartiality and independence as integral to the basic right of access to justice. [...] The same standards apply to
arbitrators as well.” (General Principles of Law and International Due Process, pp. 165, 168-169 (footnotes omitted)).

 

 

56

throughout the proceedings. The role of an ad hoc committee is to ensure that the integrity
of the proceedings and the legitimacy of the award was not undermined. The impartiality
and independence of the arbitrators, being an essential requirement for a valid and

legitimate award, can, therefore, be assessed in the context of annulment proceedings.

2. What is the applicable standard?

179. In the previous section, the Committee concluded that the “improper constitution” of a
tribunal under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention did not confine the Committee to
reviewing whether the procedural steps to constitute the tribunal had been properly
followed at the outset of the arbitration. The review under Article 52(1)(a) extends to
situations where an arbitrator is alleged to have lacked impartiality and independence at
any time during the arbitration. The Committee now turns to the applicable standard to

determine if an award should be annulled under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.

180. This standard was framed by the annulment committee in EDF v. Argentina, when an
application for annulment is made pursuant to Article 52(1)(a) and (d), “on the basis that
there were reasonable grounds to doubt the independence or impartiality of one of the
arbitrators and no proposal for disqualification had been made before the proceedings were
declared closed.”?*8 This Committee agrees with the approach taken by the EDF committee
by addressing the matter on a de novo basis and applying a similar three-step test to

determine whether annulment is warranted in this case:?”

a) was the right to raise this matter waived because the party concerned had not raised

it sufficiently promptly?

b

if not, has the party seeking annulment established that a third party would find an
evident or obvious appearance of lack of impartiality or independence on the part
of an arbitrator on a reasonable evaluation of the facts of the case (the Blue Bank

standard)? and

s7

c) if so, could the manifestly apparent lack of impartiality or independence on the part

of that arbitrator have had a material effect on the award?

181. The Committee will now address each of the steps of the test outlined above. As indicated
in paragraph 144 above, the third step of the test (step c) will be addressed together with
the Committee’s analysis of the seriousness of the departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure in Section IV.B.3.c).

a) Was the right to raise this matter waived because the party concerned had not
raised it sufficiently promptly?

(1) Spain’s Arguments

182. According to the Applicant, as a general rule, a party challenging an arbitrator for lack of
independence and impartiality is required to do so promptly and, in any event, before the
proceeding is closed. However, it has been recognized that this general rule cannot prevent
a party from challenging that arbitrator for the first time in the annulment phase if the
relevant facts only became known after the arbitration proceedings were closed.?* In this
case, the Applicant argues that it became aware of the facts on which it bases its challenge
to Dr. Alexandrov only after the Eiser Award was rendered. According to the Applicant,

in these circumstances, it must be allowed to raise the issue in this annulment proceeding.

183. The Applicant argues that the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and the Brattle Group,
in particular Mr. Lapuerta, came to the Applicant’s attention after the Eiser Award was
issued in May 2017. It is only in July 2017 that public reports of this relationship emerged,

in the context of a disqualification proposal filed in an unrelated arbitration involving

Pakistan.2*! As a consequence, Spain was deprived of the opportunity to challenge

Dr. Alexandrov in the course of the Underlying Arbitration proceeding.?**

184. Further, Spain argues that it was unaware of these facts because, throughout the three-year
course of the Underlying Arbitration, Dr. Alexandrov never disclosed his 15-year
relationship with the Brattle Group. Nor did he disclose that he was simultaneously
working as counsel with Brattle and, specifically, Mr. Lapuerta, in cases where they were

engaged as experts by his own clients.?*?

(2) Eiser Parties’ Arguments
185. The Eiser Parties argue that Spain waived its right to challenge Dr. Alexandrov because
Spain should have known of his professional relationship with the Brattle Group during

the course of the Underlying Arbitration.?**

186. The Eiser Parties note that Spain relies on a series of press reports published in GAR and
Investment Arbitration Reporter in July 2017, which refer to a challenge filed in the
Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan case.?*> However, in their view, the fact that Dr. Alexandrov
had previously worked on the same cases alongside Mr. Lapuerta was public knowledge

years before the Award was issued.?*° The Eiser Parties point to the following factors:

which Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta worked together, were issued in

GAR published an article in May 2015 where it was stated that both Dr. Alexandrov

and Mr. Lapuerta were retained by the respondent in Pluspetrol v. Perupetro;?*!

Spain itself relies on information that was publicly available, including awards
issued and made public in November 2007 and August 2009, and in a GAR article
of September 2016;77

Dr. Alexandrov’s curriculum vitae, which was provided to the Parties when he was
appointed as arbitrator in the Eiser case, listed his representations of Bulgaria,
Costa Rica, Peru and Turkey. For the Eiser Parties, this covers the cases of PSEG

v. Turkey, Pluspetrol v. Perupetro, and Bear Creek v. Peru?

Given all of the information that was available before the Eiser Award was rendered, Spain
should have known of the relationship, especially given the duty of due diligence and
investigation that the Parties had. By not acting on the information that was available at the
time, Spain has waived its right to raise any objections on Dr. Alexandrov’s impartiality

and independence.?**

(3) Analysis of the Committee

It is uncontested among the Parties that Dr. Alexandrov did not disclose the relationship he

had with the Brattle Group and, in particular, with Mr. Lapuerta. They disagree, however,

on the extent and effect of such relationship, which will be addressed later in this Decision.

At this point, the relevant question that the Committee has to address

 

is whether Spain

knew or should have known about such relationship, as argued by the Eiser Parties.

The Committee is not inclined to accept these submissions of the Eiser Parties. They have
failed to point out a clear instance where Spain either was, or reasonably ought to have
been aware of this relationship and its extent before the Award was issued. The fact that
materials, which predate the Award, have been referred to by the Eiser Parties cannot be
accepted as proof either of Spain’s knowledge of these materials or that it knew of the
extent of the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta. Nothing in these
materials suggest that Spain had actual or constructive knowledge of or that had it been
vigilant it ought to have reasonably been aware of the long and extensive relations between
Mr. Lapuerta and/or the Brattle Group with Dr. Alexandrov and/or Sidley Austin. The
Committee notes that the Eiser Parties, in particular, submitted that the PSEG award of
January 19, 2007 was part of the record in the Underlying Arbitration.” The Committee
accepts that the award was in a case where Dr. Alexandrov and Brattle acted as counsel
and expert for the same party. This was, however, more than seven years before the
appointment of Dr. Alexandrov as arbitrator in the Eiser and Spain arbitration. Nothing in
that award could have possibly led Spain to suspect the extent of Dr. Alexandrov’s
relationship with Brattle, in general, and Mr. Lapuerta, in particular.”“° It also gave no
indication, as it obviously could not, that the close relationship had continued in the seven
years that followed. Similar considerations affect the other evidence relied on by the Eiser

Parties, in this respect.

There is nothing on the record to prove that Spain had such knowledge, the burden has not
been discharged by the Eiser Parties. The existence of the information in the public domain
does not discharge the burden of the Eiser Parties to prove that Spain was aware of the
relevant facts. A clear and unequivocal waiver of a right so fundamental as to challenge
the impartiality and independence of an arbitrator, goes to the very root of the proper

constitution of a tribunal. Such a waiver cannot be established without proof that the party

193.

concerned had actual or constructive knowledge of all the facts. The Committee is not
satisfied that the Eiser Parties have proved that Spain had such knowledge. The Committee
is, therefore, of the view that Spain did not waive its objections to the independence and

impartiality of Dr. Alexandrov.

b) If the matter has been raised sufficiently promptly, has the party seeking
annulment established that a third party would find an evident or obvious
appearance of lack of impartiality on a reasonable evaluation of the facts of the
case?

(1) Spain’s Arguments

For the Applicant, the standards for the disqualification of arbitrators under Article 57 of
the ICSID Convention are directly applicable to the annulment under Article 52(1)(a).
Accordingly, pursuant to the decision in Blue Bank and many others that have followed it,
there has to be an objective “appearance of dependence or bias” and the Applicant is not
required to demonstrate “proof of actual dependence or bias.”*4” Thus, the standard is
“whether, based on a reasonable evaluation of the facts [...] a third party would find” an

“evident or obvious appearance of lack of impartiality.”?4

Further, the Applicant argues that the word “manifest” included in Article 57 of the ICSID
Convention must be interpreted as meaning “evident” or “obvious.” It does not require,

however, the lack independence or impartiality to be self-evident.??

For the Applicant, the objective “appearance of dependence or bias” is demonstrated by
both (a) the existence of a 15-year relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and the Brattle
Group, in particular with Mr. Lapuerta; and (b) the lack of disclosure of such

relationship.” These, for the Applicant, are “each sufficient reasons on their own to create

an appearance of bias regarding Mr. Alexandrov” that would warrant annulment of the

Award.?5!

194. First, the Applicant argues that proof of the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and the

Brattle Group, in particular with Mr. Lapuerta, is based on the following facts:?*

a) During his time at Sidley Austin, where he was a partner and co-head of
international arbitration, Dr. Alexandrov and his team appointed Brattle in
numerous cases, four of which involved Mr. Lapuerta as the testifying expert.

According to Spain, this is particularly relevant because the arbitrator bears the

identity of his firm, which is reinforced by his role as co-head of the firm’s

worldwide international arbitration practice;?**

b

At the same time he was serving as arbitrator in Eiser, Dr. Alexandrov was working

with the Brattle Group in Pluspetrol and Bear Creek. In Pluspetrol, the testifying

expert was Mr. Lapuerta;?>>

c) In four cases, Blusun v. Italy, Ioan Micula v. Romania, Tethyan v. Pakistan, and
SolEs Badajoz v. Spain, Dr. Alexandrov was appointed as an arbitrator by the same

party that engaged the Brattle Group as its expert. In Blusun and SolEs Badajoz, the

testifying expert was Mr. Lapuerta.?°°

Because of this relationship, Dr. Alexandrov “undoubtedly developed a close working
relationship with Mr. Lapuerta as well as his colleagues at Brattle.”?°’ In Spain’s view,
individual experts like Mr. Lapuerta cannot simply be detached from the company for
which they work. In the present case, this relationship created an unfair imbalance in the
way that Dr. Alexandrov judged the reports presented by the Brattle Group as well as their

testimony during the Hearing.

Second, the Applicant argues that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(2),
Dr. Alexandrov had the continuous obligation to disclose such relationship, an obligation
that was not subject to his discretion. This relationship had to be disclosed because it was
“likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator’s reliability for independent

judgement.”??

According to the Applicant, this failure to disclose is evidence of a lack of independence
and impartiality, especially when it forms part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts
as to the arbitrator’s impartiality, and a basis for disqualification.” In the case at hand,
Dr. Alexandrov’s failure to disclose is not an isolated occurrence since it also happened in

previous cases like SolEs Badajoz and Tethyan Copper.*°!

(2) Eiser Parties’ Arguments

The Eiser Parties do not dispute that, if the Committee were to examine this challenge, the
applicable standard would be the one used for the disqualification of an arbitrator under
Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. They contend, however, that this is a high standard

and that it is even higher at the annulment phase.”

199. Accordingly, the Committee must be satisfied, based on the evidence put before it, that the
challenged arbitrator failed to exercise independent judgment, that such failure was
“manifest”, and that it put the integrity of the proceedings into question.” Thus, the
applicable standard is whether “a third party would find that there is an evident or obvious
lack of impartiality or independence based on a reasonable evaluation of the facts.” The
Eiser Parties add that “Spain does not have to show the existence of actual bias” but the

“appearance of bias has to be ‘clearly and objectively established.”

200. For the Eiser Parties, Spain has failed to show “manifest” evidence of a lack of
independence and impartiality given that neither the professional relationship between

Dr. Alexandrov and the Brattle Group, nor the failure to disclose it, meet such a standard.2

201. First, the Eiser Parties contend that there was no conflict of interest arising from the alleged
relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta.”*’ They argue that: (a) experts are
chosen and appointed by the clients and not counsel; (b) experts testify in their own
capacity and express their own independent opinions; as such, a conflict can only arise due
to the expert’s individual relationship with an individual arbitrator; (c) the activities of an
arbitrator’s law firm do not automatically create a conflict of interest and, therefore, cases

handled by Sidley Austin lawyers do not show a “close personal relationship” with

Mr. Lapuerta; and, (d) there are no reasons to equate Mr. Lapuerta with the Brattle

Group.?

In the eyes of the Eiser Parties, Spain’s case is based on speculations. Spain has resorted

to misrepresenting the facts in an attempt to amplify the magnitude of the professional

relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta.”® Specifically, the Eiser Parties

argue that:

a

b

d

In the 15-year period at issue, there are only three ICSID cases in which
Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta were respectively engaged by the same party as
counsel and expert; these are PSEG v. Turkey, Alapli v. Turkey, and Pluspetrol v.

Perupetro?”

Pluspetrol is the only case in which Mr. Lapuerta and Dr. Alexandrov were engaged
by the same party at the same time Dr. Alexandrov was sitting as arbitrator in the

Underlying Arbitration;2”!
Mr. Lapuerta was not the testifying expert in Bear Creek;?””

There is an undisclosed commercial arbitration in which the same party engaged
Sidley Austin and Mr. Lapuerta; as of October 12, 2017, this arbitration was
suspended and Dr. Alexandrov was asked by the party to remain involved only if

the proceeding resumed;?”?

e) The SolEs Badajoz and Tethyan Copper cases are irrelevant for the purpose of
establishing the basis of any conflict because Dr. Alexandrov was acting as

arbitrator and not counsel;?”4 and

f) Overall, there are only four cases in which Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta
worked, respectively, as counsel and expert witness for the same party (PSEG v.
Turkey, Alapli v. Turkey, Pluspetrol v. Perupetro, and a commercial arbitration,

which was in abeyance).?”°

203. The Eiser Parties conclude that Spain has offered no evidence of any ““‘close relationship’”
between Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta or any “‘unique reliance’” by the former upon
the latter.?”° On the contrary, his relationship with any of the experts from the Brattle Group
did not go beyond engaging them as experts, which is common practice in international
arbitration.””’ In any case, even if the Committee were to conclude that Dr. Alexandrov’s
engagements with Mr. Lapuerta constitute a close professional relationship, the Eiser

Parties contend that such a relationship does not create a conflict.?”*

204. Second, contrary to Spain’s assertions, Dr. Alexandrov did not have the obligation to
disclose his relationship with the Brattle Group. In fact, an arbitrator has the discretion to
determine whether to disclose a fact or circumstance, and cannot be criticized for honestly
exercising such discretion. As such, Dr. Alexandrov’s lack of disclosure does not establish
the existence of a lack of independence or impartiality and was just an honest exercise of

said discretion.?”

served as partner and co-chair of Sidley Austin’s international arbitration

practice;?**

d) The Tribunal in the Underlying Arbitration was constituted in July 2014 and the

Award was rendered in May 2017;78

e) There are four cases in which Dr. Alexandrov was appointed as arbitrator and the

g) In addition to the above-mentioned eight cases, there is at least one undisclosed
investor-state arbitration and one undisclosed commercial arbitration in which
Sidley Austin was engaged as counsel by the party that engaged the Brattle Group

as experts;?°”

i. Both cases overlapped with the Underlying Arbitration; however, as of
October 12, 2017, the tribunal in the investor-state arbitration was yet to be

288

constituted;*°° and

ii. Mr. Lapuerta was engaged as the testifying expert only in the commercial

arbitration.?*°

206. With these facts in mind, the Committee must determine if the standard for disqualification
has been met. The Committee agrees that the appropriate standard is the one adopted by
the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in Blue Bank®? and numerous other

cases:??!

 

Impartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a
party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external
control. Independence and impartiality both “protect parties against
arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to
the merits of the case.” Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID
Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather
it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.

The applicable legal standard is an “objective standard based on a
reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.” As a
consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the

disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the
Convention.

Finally, regarding the meaning of the word “manifest” in Article 57
of the Convention, a number of decisions have concluded that it
means “evident” or “obvious,” and that it relates to the ease with
which the alleged lack of the qualities can be perceived.?°”

[...] the Chairman concludes that it has been demonstrated that a
third party would find an evident or obvious appearance of lack of
impartiality on a reasonable evaluation of the facts in this case.

Accordingly, the Committee will determine whether a third party would find an evident or
obvious appearance of bias on the part of Dr. Alexandrov on an objective assessment of
the facts in this case. To that end, the Committee will first address whether there was a
close relationship between Dr. Alexandrov/Sidley Austin and Mr. Lapuerta/the Brattle
Group that could create a manifest appearance of bias?” on the part of Dr. Alexandrov.
Second, the Committee will determine whether Dr. Alexandrov had to disclose this

relationship and what are the consequences of his failure to do so.
(a) The existence of a relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta.

The Committee will determine whether in light of the cases cited by the Parties, there exists
a relationship that creates a manifest appearance of bias®° in the eyes of a third party, on

an objective assessment of the facts. The Committee starts by noting that the facts in

2 Ex, RL-0104, Blue Bank v. Venezuela, Decision on Disqualification, {{] 59-61 (footnotes omitted).

293 Ex, RL-0104, Blue Bank v. Venezuela, Decision on Disqualification, J 69.

24 The Committee is conscious of the fact that the jurisprudence on the subject uses different labels. Sometimes
interchangeably. Some of these are “manifest appearance of bias”, “real likelihood of bias”, “real danger of bias”, and
“giving rise to justifiable doubts”. The Committee is of the view that the applicable standard is that on an objective
assessment of the facts it would manifestly appear to a third party that justice was either not done or not seen to be
done. Or, in other words, justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.
It is in this sense that the expression has been used by the Committee.

The Committee also notes with approval, the following pa

age from Prof. Schreuer:

 

 

A conflict of interest is an objective criterion that is independent of the moral
character of the arbitrator in question. In particular, a conflict of interest may exist
even if there is no suspicion or likelihood of corruption in the sense of
Art. 52(1)(c) [...].

Ex. CL-0295/Ex. RL-0106, Schreuer et al., THE ICSID CONVENTION, p. 512.
2°5 The word “bias” wherever used by the Committee is in the sense of a “conflict of interest” which may manifestly

appear to a third party, on an objective ass

 

‘ssment of the facts, as a lack of independence or impartiality.

paragraph 205 show unequivocally that, before and during the Underlying Arbitration,
there were several past and present professional connections and interaction in various
capacities between Dr. Alexandrov, as counsel and as member of the law firm Sidley

Austin, on the one hand, and Mr. Lapuerta and the Brattle Group, on the other.

Moreover, Dr. Alexandrov’s interaction with Brattle experts has been the subject of
challenge and discussions previously by the PCA’s Secretary-General and the World
Bank’s Chairman of the Administrative Council in the Tethyan Copper case. The
unchallenged arbitrators in SolEs Badajoz also discussed these interactions in the context
of a challenge against Dr. Alexandrov for the same reasons. The Committee starts by
observing that the conflict issue in those cases arose while they were ongoing and not in

the context of annulment proceedings.

Tethyan Copper:

In Tethyan Copper, Pakistan challenged arbitrator Dr. Alexandrov based on his relationship
with the Brattle Group.?°° The PCA’s Secretary-General Hugo Hans Siblesz found in his
Opinion that Pakistan “has not shown that the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and
Brattle goes beyond a normal working relationship as is common between counsel and
valuation experts involved in international arbitration cases” and that “such a working
relationship would [not] lead to a lack of the required qualities of an arbitrator.””°’ Having
reviewed the Parties’ submissions, Dr. Alexandrov’s explanations and the PCA
Secretary-General’s Opinion, the unchallenged arbitrators reached the conclusion that the
Proposal for the Disqualification of Dr. Alexandrov did not meet the standard set forth in

Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. In the same case, later in the proceeding, Dr. Jim

Prof. Sachs) on September 5, 2017. See Ex. CL-0290, Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan, Decision of Co-Arbitrators.

Yong Kim (Chairman of the Administrative Council) dismissed a further challenge against

Dr. Alexandrov and his fellow arbitrators.?8

Spain has raised the illicit disclosure of these decisions.” The Committee is satisfied with
the Eiser Parties’ clarification from counsel in the Tethyan Copper arbitration that there are
no confidentiality orders which would cover these decisions*” and cannot identify any
breach of Spain’s rights of defense related to the submission of the Tethyan Copper

decisions.

The Committee is of the view that the fact pattern in the Underlying Arbitration is not the
same.*”! First, an important difference between Tethyan Copper and the case at hand is that
in Tethyan Copper the Members of the Tribunal were aware of Dr. Alexandrov’s
relationship with Brattle and Prof. Davis. Moreover, the unchallenged arbitrators (Lord
Hoffmann and Prof. Sachs) issued a decision on the disqualification proposal regarding
Dr. Alexandrov after receiving the PCA _ Secretary-General’s Opinion, on
September 5, 2017.5 It was clear, therefore, that the other two arbitrators did not believe

that his involvement would affect their deliberations.

Moreover, in Tethyan Copper, the Brattle Group expert involved was Prof. Davis. When
asked, Dr. Alexandrov stated that he had only interacted, as counsel, with this expert in a
single case. Furthermore, it was Prof. Davis’ disclosure regarding the Bear Creek case
which triggered the challenge against Dr. Alexandrov.*” Even though it could be said that
the Bear Creek case where Prof. Davis acted as damages expert, with Dr. Alexandrov

acting as counsel, was concurrent with the Tethyan Copper case where Dr. Alexandrov

Prof. Graham Davis’ disclosure stated: “I provided expert testimony on behalf of the Republic of Peru in Bear

Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21), having been retained by a team at
Sidley Austin LLP that included Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a member of this Arbitral Tribunal. My engagement in that
matter has concluded” (Ex. CL-0289, Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan, PCA Opinion, 4 11).

acted as arbitrator, the fact is that as Prof. Davis stated, his “[...] engagement [in the Bear
Creek case] ha[d] concluded.”** This is confirmed by the fact that the Bear Creek case
was almost over, with no filings pending, when the challenge was brought by Pakistan.*°>
It seems that the PCA’s Secretary-General based his ruling on the same assumption,
i.e. that in Tethyan Copper there was no “concurrent service” with Dr. Alexandrov acting
as arbitrator in Tethyan Copper and Dr. Alexandrov working as counsel with the damages

expert in Bear Creek:

Against this background, I conclude that the present procedural
situation may, in principle, give rise to an issue conflict. As a general
matter, it cannot be ruled out that the concurrent service of an
arbitrator as counsel in another pending arbitration, in which
the damages expert of the party that he represents has
submitted a similar and “innovative” damage valuation method,
may prevent that arbitrator from evaluating this method with
an open mind. Whether an issue conflict that warrants the
disqualification of the arbitrator arises will however depend on the
specific facts of a case and the applicable legal standard.*°°
(emphasis added)

214. The facts are materially different here. Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta worked in four
cases as counsel and expert for the same party. Two of them, Pluspetrol and the
confidential commercial arbitration, were pending when Dr. Alexandrov was sitting as
arbitrator in the Underlying Arbitration. In addition, Dr. Alexandrov was working
simultaneously in the Bear Creek arbitration with other Brattle experts. Besides there were

several past and present professional connections and interactions between them.

   

304 This declaration was made on March 22, 2017 in the Tethyan Copper arbitration when Prof. Davis’ expert report
as submitted (see Ex. CL-0289, Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan, PCA Opinion, { 10). The hearing on jurisdiction and
merits in the Bear Creek case took place on September 7-14, 2016 in Washington, D.C. (see
https://icsid. worldbank.org/en/Pages/cases/casedetail.aspx?CaseNo=ARB/14/21).

307 Ex. C-0319, Letter from J. Donoghue and A. Joubin-Bret to ICSID in SolEs Badajoz v.

SolEs Badajoz:

In SolEs Badajoz, Spain also based its challenge on the relationship between an arbitrator,
Dr. Alexandrov, and an expert of the Brattle Group, Mr. Lapuerta. The unchallenged
arbitrators could not agree on the outcome of the challenge, and stated that they were
“equally divided on the matter and have failed to reach a decision.”*°’ Later,

Dr. Alexandrov resigned from the case.*”*

The difference between the SolEs Badajoz facts and those before us, in this case, is that in
SolEs Badajoz, Dr. Alexandrov was not simultaneously acting, as counsel, with
Mr. Lapuerta, as damages expert. Conversely, it is uncontested that, during the Underlying
Arbitration, Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta were working simultaneously, as counsel
and damages expert, for the same party, in two other pending arbitrations. In addition, as
he was sitting as arbitrator in the Eiser case, Dr. Alexandrov was working simultaneously

as counsel in the Bear Creek arbitration with other Brattle Group experts.

The Committee has carefully reviewed the uncontested facts, as well as other decisions in
such cases. As pointed out in the Suez case, it is true that arbitrators, lawyers and experts
doing investment arbitrations live on the same planet” Some interaction is, therefore,

inevitable. Nevertheless, it is obvious and it is to be expected that the more “connections”

In light of that development, I have decided to step down from the Tribunal in this
case. I continue to believe that the Proposal for Disqualification lacks merit.
However, assuming that the Chairman of the Administrative Council rejects the
Proposal, I will face a situation of serving on a tribunal where one of the two co-
arbitrators may have doubts about my impartiality. In those circumstances, I
believe that my continued service as an arbitrator on this Tribunal would likely be
impaired and could thus be a disservice to the parties.

Arbitrators are not disembodied spirits dwelling on Mars, who descend to earth to

the call to arbitrate another. Like other professionals living and working in the

there are between them, across cases and, particularly, in different roles, the more chances
there are that these may give rise to conflicts. For the sake of the fair and objective conduct
of the arbitral proceedings, these should, therefore, be declared and specifically brought to

the attention of the parties and other arbitrators.

The Committee finds that this case does not bring forth merely an isolated instance of
Mr. Lapuerta and Dr. Alexandrov working together. In addition to the several past and
present professional connections and interactions between them, the Committee has taken
particular note of four instances where Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta worked for the
same party, as counsel and expert respectively. In two of those cases, Dr. Alexandrov, as
counsel, was interacting with Mr. Lapuerta as expert, at the same time that he was acting
in this case as an arbitrator and Mr. Lapuerta as a damages expert of one of the parties.
This was in addition to the longstanding relationship between the Brattle Group and
Dr. Alexandrov’s the then law firm, Sidley Austin, and included another concurrent case —
Bear Creek — in which Dr. Alexandrov was working as counsel with Brattle Group experts

(Prof. Davis).

Arbitrators should either not sit in cases or be prepared to be challenged and/or disqualified
where, on an objective assessment of things, assessed by a fair minded and informed third
party observer, they may not be perceived as independent and impartial. The role of a third
party observer, when these matters are challenged, in annulment proceedings, is performed
by annulment committees. It matters not that Dr. Alexandrov may not even have been
conscious of the insidious effects of this association. What matters is that an independent
observer, on an objective assessment of all the facts, would conclude that there was a

manifest appearance of bias on the part of Dr. Alexandrov.
(b) The lack of disclosure of the relationship

In the previous section, the Committee has concluded that the relationship between

Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta, creates a manifest appearance of bias. In this section,

the Committee will determine: (1) whether Dr. Alexandrov had the obligation to disclose

said relationship; and (2) what are the consequences of his non-disclosure.*!”

First, the Committee will address whether Dr. Alexandrov had the duty to disclose his
relationship with Mr. Lapuerta. The issue is whether the relationship could be considered
a “circumstance” which “might cause [Dr. Alexandrov’s] reliability for independent
judgment to be questioned” or was “likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to [his]
reliability for independent judgment”,*'! and, therefore, warranted disclosure during the

arbitration proceedings, in accordance with Rule 6 of the Arbitration Rules.*!”

Two relevant and connected responsibilities flow from an arbitrator’s duty of disclosure,
one substantive and the other temporal. Substantive is the obligation to disclose “any other

circumstance that might cause [his/her] reliability for independent judgment to be

310 On the consequences of Dr. Alexandrov’s non-disclosure, see infra | 245-253.

311 Ex, RL-0114, Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine, Decision on Disqualification, {| 52-55. See also, Suez: “[a]
reasonable interpretation of ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 is that an arbitrator is required to disclose a fact only if he or
she reasonably believes that such fact would reasonably cause his or her reliability for independent judgment to be
questioned by a reasonable person” (Ex. RL-0126, Suez v. Argentina, Disqualification Decision II, { 46).

3” Rule 6 of the Arbitration Rules (“Constitution of the Tribunal”) states:

(2) Before or at the first session of the Tribunal, each arbitrator shall sign a
declaration in the following form:

“To the best of my knowledge there is no reason why I should not serve on the
Arbitral Tribunal constituted by the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes with respect to a dispute between __ and ___.
“[ shall keep confidential all information coming to my knowledge as a result of
my participation in this proceeding, as well as the contents of any award made by
the Tribunal.

“[ shall judge fairly as between the parties, according to the applicable law, and
shall not accept any instruction or compensation with regard to the proceeding
from any source except as provided in the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and in the
Regulations and Rules made pursuant thereto.

“Attached is a statement of (a) my past and present professional, business and
other relations if any) with the parties and (b) any other circumstance that
might cause my reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party.
I acknowledge that by signing this declaration, I assume a continuing obligation
promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any such relationship or
circumstance that subsequently arises during this proceeding.”

 
 

Any arbitrator failing to sign a declaration by the end of the first session of the

Tribunal shall be deemed to have resigned.

questioned by a party.”*!? Temporal is the connected and ongoing nature of this substantive
obligation, whereby the arbitrator “assume[s] a continuing obligation promptly to notify
the Secretary-General of the Centre of any such relationship or circumstance that

subsequently arises during this proceeding.”?!*

223. The ongoing obligation to disclose cannot be construed narrowly in favor of the arbitrator.
It must be approached from the point of view of a party.*!> Disclosure inoculates arbitrators
from the possibility of any, real or perceived, conflict of interest. As the IBA Guidelines
state, “[a]ny doubt as to whether an arbitrator should disclose certain facts or circumstances
should be resolved in favour of disclosure.”*'® There are multiple ways in which a conflict
of interest may arise when an arbitrator also acts or has acted as counsel, in another dispute,
albeit between different parties. The risks and possibilities of conflict of interest, inherent

in double-hatting, dictate caution.

224. The question before the Committee is whether, in light of the facts?!’ before the Committee,
the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and Sidley Austin, on the one hand, and
Mr. Lapuerta and the Brattle Group, on the other, was a circumstance which should have
been disclosed to avoid doubts about Dr. Alexandrov’s independence and impartiality, as

an arbitrator, in the arbitration proceedings.

225. It is the view of this Committee that these facts*!* demonstrated enough past and present

professional connections and interaction between Dr. Alexandrov, as counsel and as

33 Rule 6 of the Arbitration Rules. The Committee agrees that such obligation “‘includes virtually any kind of
relationship, interest or contact with anything or anyone that is in some degree related to the case,’ including
‘relationships of the arbitrator and the arbitrator’s law firm with counsel, co-arbitrators and fact or expert witnesses
appearing in the matter.”” See Annulment Memorial, {| 86; citing Ex. RL-0113, Daele, CHALLENGE AND

member of the law firm Sidley Austin,*!? on the one hand, and the Brattle Group and
Mr. Lapuerta, on the other, to require that this relationship be disclosed to the Parties and
to the other arbitrators. These past and present connections and interactions should have
alerted Dr. Alexandrov to the possibility that his independence and impartiality may be
questioned, by one of the Parties to the case before him. As the House of Lords observed
in the Pinochet case: “impartiality may be compromised not only through a specific act but

also where the appearance of impartiality has not been strongly guaranteed.”>”°

The Eiser Parties argue that the IBA Guidelines do not expressly list this particular
relationship i.e., of counsel and expert as subject to mandatory disclosure.*”! It could not,
therefore, according to them have led to his disqualification, as a member of the Tribunal.
Similarly, according to them, this relationship cannot provide a ground for annulment
under Article 52. The Committee has difficulties accepting this submission as correct. First,

to conflicts. Third, the Committee notes that the Guidelines do not include this type of
relationship in the “Green List”, either. The Green List identifies, “specific situations where

no appearance and no actual conflict of interest exists from an objective point of view.”??>

The Eiser Parties also contend that “experts are chosen and appointed by clients not by
counsel”? and that ‘independent experts testify in their own capacity based upon their
own expertise and qualifications in the particular field in question.”** In the opinion of the

Committee, nothing turns on the answer to the questions about who appoints the expert or

what are the qualifications or expertise of such a damages expert. What is important is that
damages experts work closely with counsel in the preparation of a case. In the course of an
arbitration there are multiple exchanges between them. They do not and cannot possibly
maintain between them the kind of professional distance which is required to be maintained
between a party, its counsel and its experts in a case, on the one hand, and the member of

the tribunal hearing that case, on the other.

In the Committee’s view, in this case, the duty to disclose was warranted due to the
respective roles of a damages expert and counsel in an arbitration. It was warranted not
only because of the existence of such a relationship but also by the extent of the past and
present interactions, at issue. These taken together triggered Dr. Alexandrov’s obligation
to disclose. The Committee is, therefore, of the view that Dr. Alexandrov should have
disclosed his relationship with Mr. Lapuerta. Spain submits that there was also a duty on
the part of Mr. Lapuerta, as an expert, to disclose his relationship with Sidley Austin and
Dr. Alexandrov according to the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Arbitration.*?° The Committee is not inclined to express any opinion on this submission,
as even a disclosure by Mr. Lapuerta would not have absolved Dr. Alexandrov from his

disclosure obligations as an arbitrator.

To conclude this section, the Committee recalls that it has determined: (i) that the Applicant
has not waived its right to raise this issue, and (ii) that a third party would find a manifest
appearance of bias on the part of Dr. Alexandrov based on an objective assessment of the

facts. As indicated above,*?”

B. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE

230. Section B will set the reasons for which the Committee has concluded that there was a
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee will
(1) summarize the Parties’ positions on this issue; and (2) set the appropriate standard to
be followed under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the Committee
will determine whether: (a) the impartiality and independence of an arbitrator is a
fundamental rule of procedure; (b) there was a departure from such rule; and (c) the

departure was serious and may have had a material effect on the Award.

231. It is noteworthy that the Committee is of the view that the issues and facts related to the
proper constitution of the tribunal under Article 52(1)(a) are also relevant to its analysis of

the alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d).

1. Spain’s Arguments

232. According to the Applicant, for an award to be annulled under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID
Convention, two elements are required: (a) the departure has to be “serious”; and (b) it
must be from a “fundamental” rule of procedure.*”* For Spain, there is no doubt that the

right to an independent and impartial tribunal is a fundamental rule of procedure.*”?

233. Spain further argues that a departure is serious if it deprives a party of the protection
afforded by the rule of procedure and/or the departure had or may have had a material effect

on the tribunal’s decision.**° Spain rejects the Eiser Parties’ assertion that the departure is

“serious” only if there is “actual material prejudice” and there is “a showing that the
violation of the rule has in fact caused a ‘substantially different result.’”” Such a standard is

“unrealistic and highly speculative.”**!

In this case, both the existence of the relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and the Brattle
Group and the failure to disclose such relationship, “have irreparably tainted the Arbitration
and the resulting Award.”*** According to Spain, “Mr. Alexandrov’s presence on the
Tribunal, notwithstanding his failure to disclose his relationship with Brattle, in violation
of the disclosure obligations of ICSID Arbitration Rule 6, and his apparent bias in favor of
the Eiser Parties’ experts, stripped Spain of the protection afforded by the fundamental
right to be heard by an independent and impartial tribunal.”**? Thus, the lack of impartiality
of the part of Dr. Alexandrov amounts a serious departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure that warrants the annulment of the Award.?*4

2. Eiser Parties’ Arguments

The Eiser Parties argue that for an award to be annulled under Article 52(1)(d), three
elements are required: (a) a “fundamental” rule of procedure; (b) a departure from such
tule; and (c) the departure must be serious. Accordingly, not every departure from a rule
of procedure justifies annulment.*** For the Eiser Parties, there is no doubt that the right to
an independent and impartial arbitrator is a fundamental rule of procedure. However, the

other two remaining elements of the test ((b) and (c)) are not met in this case.**°

They argue that committees have adopted two positions to consider that a departure is

“serious.” The first approach, preferred by the Eiser Parties, requires the existence of an

“substantially different result.”?7’ The second approach, presented by the Applicant,
requires only the showing of a “potential effect” of the departure on the award.*** Under

either approach, the departure has to be “outcome-determinative.”**°

For the Eiser Parties, there is no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure since there
is neither a relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta that could give rise to
aconflict, nor a violation of the rules on disclosure.*#° Second, irrespective of the approach
adopted, there is no evidence that, at a minimum, the alleged departure may have had an
impact on the Award. There is no evidence that the Tribunal sided with Mr. Lapuerta’s
analysis because of an alleged undisclosed bias, nor that such alleged bias made the
Tribunal, and particularly the other two arbitrators, reach a different decision than the one

they would have otherwise reached.™*!

3. Analysis of the Committee

In the Committee’s view, there are no substantial differences between the standards
proposed by Spain and the Eiser Parties. The Committee will, therefore, examine:
(a) whether the procedural rule alleged to be violated is fundamental; (6) whether there is
a departure from that rule; and (c) if there is a departure under (b), whether such departure

is “serious” in terms of Article 52(1)(a).

242.

a) Whether the right to the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator is a
fundamental rule of procedure
In the Committee’s view, independence and impartiality of an arbitrator is a fundamental
tule of procedure. This means that the arbitrator has a duty not only to be impartial and
independent but also to be perceived as such by an independent and objective third party
observer. This duty includes the duty to disclose any circumstance that might cause his
reliability for independent judgment to be reasonably questioned by a party. In this respect,
this Committee subscribes to the EDF committee’s views that “[i]t is difficult to imagine
a rule of procedure more fundamental than the rule that a case must be heard by an
independent and impartial tribunal.”*#? There can be no right to a fair trial or a right of fair

defense without an independent and impartial tribunal.

b) Whether there has been a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure

As explained in Section IV.A.2.b)(3) of this Decision, the Committee is of the view that to
an independent third party observer, based on an objective assessment of all the facts, it

would be manifestly apparent that Dr. Alexandrov lacked impartiality.

In this case, the Committee is of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of this case,
Dr. Alexandrov’s absence of disclosure, deprived Spain of the opportunity to challenge
him in the arbitration proceedings. Consequently, it also deprived Spain from seeking the
benefit and protection of an independent and impartial tribunal which the right to challenge
is intended to provide. This affected Spain’s right of defense and fair trial, as well. This
failure cannot be regarded as a mere inconsequential error or omission or something

insignificant having no bearing on the outcome of the proceedings before the Tribunal.

Accordingly, the Committee cannot but conclude that there has also been a departure from

a fundamental rule of procedure.

3 Ex. RL-0102, EDF v. Argentina, Decision on Annulment, { 123.

84

ce) Whether the lack of impartiality or independence on the part of Dr. Alexandrov
may have had a material effect on the Award and thus amounts to a serious
departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
243. It was established in Section IV.A.2.b)(3) that an independent third party observer would
find, on an objective assessment of all the facts, that there was a manifest appearance of
bias on the part of Dr. Alexandrov. It has also been concluded in Section IV.B.3.b) that
such lack of independence and impartiality, whether actual or manifestly apparent, by even
one arbitrator, in a three member tribunal, constitutes a departure from a fundamental rule

of procedure.

244. As observed above at paragraph 231 of this Decision, because the Committee considers
that the facts and issues are relevant to its analysis under Article 52(1)(a) and (d), the
Committee will now address the third step of the EDF test, namely whether the manifestly
apparent lack of impartiality on the part of Dr. Alexandrov may have had a material effect
on the Award under Article 52(1)(a) and Article 52(1)(d), i.e. whether the departure from

a fundamental rule of procedure was “serious.”

245. In so doing, the Committee has to keep in sight the fact that Dr. Alexandrov’s
non-disclosure resulted in the Parties’ pleading, and the Tribunal deliberating, without any
knowledge of Dr. Alexandrov’s and/or Sidley Austin’s relationship with Mr. Lapuerta

and/or the Brattle Group.

246. Turning to the Award itself, unanimity does not impede annulment. This is axiomatic
because it is impossible for an annulment committee to pierce the veil of a tribunal’s

deliberations or poll arbitrators.*# Irrespective of the independence and impartiality of the

1344

two other arbitrators on the Tribunal each member of the Tribunal, including

Dr. Alexandrov, is expected to have influenced the other two with his views and analysis,

during the course of deliberations. It is in the very nature of deliberations that arbitrators

*8 The EDF committee stated that: “It is impossible to tell what degree of influence on one or both colleagues an
arbitrator might have had in the course of what are necessarily confidential deliberations. The fact that an award was
rendered unanimously may be a relevant consideration in relation to the exercise of the discretion not to annul an
award but the Committee does not accept that unanimity necessarily precludes annulment”, Ex. RL-0102, EDF
v. Argentina, Decision on q 135 is added). Cfr. ment Counter- ial, {7 137-138. See

248.

exchange opinions and are persuaded or influenced by the opinions of their colleagues.
That makes us conclude that it would be unsafe to hold that Dr. Alexandrov’s views and
analysis could not have had any material bearing on the opinions of his fellow arbitrators.
It is not improbable that they had such effect and, therefore, excluding this possibility from

consideration would go against the nature of deliberations.

The Committee now turns to the damages section of the Award since there, in particular,
the relationship of Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta is of particular significance. The
Committee begins with the fact, as stated previously, that both Mr. Lapuerta and
Dr. Alexandrov failed to disclose their relationship. Upon examination of the Award, the
Committee sees nothing there which could signal or suggest that Mr. Lapuerta’s damages
report had no material effect on the reasoning or findings in the Award. The Committee

further notes that the Tribunal adopted Mr. Lapuerta’s model for damages in its entirety.*4>

The Eiser Parties contend that “there is no evidence to support the notion that the Tribunal’s
preference to adopt certain of the calculations submitted by Mr. Lapuerta in the Brattle
Reports had anything to do with Dr. Alexandrov’s alleged predisposition to Mr. Lapuerta
as a Brattle expert.”*#° In the Committee’s opinion, this is precisely the problem. The
Committee cannot determine the impact of the participation of Dr. Alexandrov on the other
two arbitrators. It is not possible for the Committee to conclude that had the relationship
between Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta and the Brattle Group been disclosed and the
other arbitrators made aware of it, it would have had no significant effect on the
deliberations between them and Dr. Alexandrov. The Committee also cannot ignore the

347

fact that the Tribunal adopted the damages model proposed by Brattle’*’ with Mr. Lapuerta

as the testifying expert.*4*

+5 “(T]he Tribunal apparently failed to properly scrutinize Brattle’s calculations and blindly adopted its valuation”,
Annulment Memorial, {| 109. The Committee notes that Spain in fact takes issue in these annulment proceedings with
the substance of the damages determination.

249.

250.

251.

The Eiser Parties sought to downplay the role of Mr. Lapuerta in this case, by arguing that
he was not the main testifying expert on damages, and that he only acted as a regulatory
expert in the case. On this basis they further argued that it was an insufficient ground for
annulment. The Committee does not share this view. The obligation to disclose cannot be
undermined or diluted by the fact that Mr. Lapuerta was not the main testifying expert in
the present case.? He had an important role in the case.*° The Committee, thus, finds
critical the fact that the other arbitrators had no knowledge of the relationship between
Dr. Alexandrov and Mr. Lapuerta. Had this information been shared with them, either by
Dr. Alexandrov or by Mr. Lapuerta and the Brattle Group, it may have affected both the
deliberations and the outcome. In any event it is impossible to conclude that such disclosure
would have had no material effect on the arbitrators, their deliberations and the ultimate

outcome.

The Committee is not suggesting that each arbitrator did not conduct its own assessment
of the evidence. Its opinion is that in the ordinary course, the views of each arbitrator
influence and are expected to influence the views of the others, during deliberations. The
influence of Dr. Alexandrov on his co-arbitrators would have been perceived differently in
every material respect, had they known the full facts and extent of his and Sidley Austin’s
longstanding relationship with the Brattle Group and Mr. Lapuerta. The Committee also
cannot rule out the likelihood of this, in turn, having a material bearing on the outcome of

the case including but not limited to a different damages evaluation.

It is not possible for the Committee to conclude that, had the relationship been disclosed,
the arbitrators would have remained unanimous in their adoption of the Brattle model.*>!
In any event, after such disclosures, the arbitrators would have arrived at their decision
with full knowledge of the Alexandrov-Sidley Austin-Lapuerta-Brattle Group relationship,
whatever the outcome. What the Committee can also conclude is that due to this non-

disclosure Spain lost the possibility of a different award.

Finally, the Committee finds useful to quote the Caratube committee:

A departure is serious if the violation of the fundamental rule of
procedure produced a material impact on the award. The applicant
however is not required to prove that the violation of the rule of
procedure was decisive for the outcome, or that the applicant would
have won the case if the rule had been applied. As the Wena
committee stated, what the applicant must simply demonstrate is
“the impact that the issue may have had on the Award.”?°?

Looking at all these elements holistically, the Committee concludes that this undisclosed
relationship could have had a material effect on the Award. The non-disclosure was,
therefore, serious and warrants annulment both under clauses (a) and (d) of paragraph (1)

of Article 52.

Finally, the Eiser Parties also argued that, even if the requirements under Article 52 are
met, the Committee still has the discretion to decide not to annul the Award.*>? The
Committee agrees with the Pey Casado committee which took the view that “it has no
discretion not to annul an award if a serious departure from a fundamental rule is

7354

establishe and that in any case “[t]he discretion of the Committee lies in the evaluation

affects the legal right of the parties with respect to an outcome-determinative issue. When
one of the most basic requirements of justice, such as the right to an independent and
impartial tribunal, is disregarded, an award cannot stand and must be annulled in its
entirety. In a case such as this, it is neither possible nor would it be proper to parse the
Award and hold that the conduct affected only a certain part of the Award and had no
impact on other parts. The curtailment of the right to an independent and impartial tribunal

permeates the Award. The doctrine of severability has no application to a case such as this.

Annulment committees are guardians of the ICSID system and must set the bar high, with

regard to disclosure obligations, in particular, and, in general, with respect to addressing

conflict of interest of arbitrators who also choose to act as counsel in investment disputes.
The Committee, thus, declares the Award annulled for improper constitution of the

Tribunal and for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

In view of its decision to annul the Award on the aforementioned grounds, the Committee

sees no need to address the other grounds for annulment raised by the Applicant.

Vv. COSTS

On July 5, 2019, both Parties filed their respective submission on costs pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rules 28(2) and 53, paragraph 20 of Procedural Order No. 1, paragraph 16 of

B. EISER PARTIES’ SUBMISSION ON Costs

The Eiser Parties seek an award on costs pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention

ordering that Spain bear the Eiser Parties’ costs for legal representation totaling

€2,587,765.80, broken down as follows:

Having referred to Articles 61(2) and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID

Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), and the ECT, the Eiser Parties argue that

the Committee has wide discretion to allocate costs between the Parties.**” They further

argue that they must be allowed to recover the costs they have incurred in the annulment

proceedings in order to be fully compensated for the damage they suffered as a result of
Spain’s violations of the ECT, as held by the Eiser Tribunal.*°* This would not only be in
accordance with the practice of annulment committees but it would also be warranted in
this case because Spain used these annulment proceedings to file several baseless claims
and to relitigate issues that the Eiser Tribunal had already decided.**? The Eiser Parties
therefore request that they be awarded “the full value of their costs” and that Spain “remain

responsible for its own costs and the costs of the Annulment proceedings.”*

Cc. COMMITTEE’S DECISION ON Costs

The Committee begins by noting that the ECT does not contain applicable provisions
regarding the allocation of costs in disputes between an investor and a Contracting Party.
Thus, the Committee will base its decision on costs taking into account the applicable

provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) prescribes that the award shall be in writing and shall contain

“any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.”

Pursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, Article 61(2)

and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) apply mutatis mutandis to annulment proceedings.

In addition, Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations

provides:

35° Claimants’ Statement of Costs, § 12.
3 Claimants’ Statement of Costs, J 13.

266.

267.

[I]n the event that an application for annulment of an award is
registered, the above provisions of this Rule shall apply mutatis
mutandis, except that the applicant shall be solely responsible for
making the advance payments requested by the Secretary-General
to cover expenses following the constitution of the Committee, and
without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with
Article 52(4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom
expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding
shall be paid.

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention grants discretion to the Committee to allocate
expenses incurred by the parties in connection with annulment proceedings, fees and
expenses of the members of the Committee, and charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre. This discretion is also recognized in Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID

Administrative and Financial Regulations.

Absent additional guidance in the Convention, the Arbitration Rules, and the
Administrative and Financial Regulations, the Committee has the discretion either to apply

the “costs follow the event” principle (i.e., the “loser pays” principle)**!

or to apportion
fees and expenses of the parties, fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre differently between the parties.*” In light
of the circumstances of this case, the Committee will apply the “costs follow the event”
principle. As explained below, these “circumstances” are: (1) that the Parties agreed to the

“loser pays” approach; (2) that other committees have adopted this approach, as pointed

out by the Eiser Parties; and (3) the Award was annulled in its entirety for improper

constitution of the Tribunal and serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

First, the Committee notes that the Parties are in agreement on the application of this rule.
Spain seeks recovery from the Eiser Parties of the ICSID administrative fees and advance
payments as well as of its legal fees and expenses.*® The Eiser Parties seek recovery of its
cost for its legal fees and disbursements and contend that Spain shall bear the costs of the

annulment proceedings.*™

Second, the Eiser Parties refer to the recent practice of annulment committees to award
costs to the prevailing party as described in Venoklim Holding v. Venezuela and contend

that “[tJhere are no good reasons for the Committee to depart from this practice here.”>°>

Third, in the case at hand, the Committee has declared the Award annulled in its entirety
for improper constitution of the Tribunal and for “serious” departure from a fundamental
tule of procedure. The Applicant was compelled to go through these annulment
proceedings because it was deprived of the opportunity to challenge Dr. Alexandrov, and
consequently, deprived of the benefit and protection of an independent and impartial
tribunal. The Committee has already mentioned that this situation also affected the
Applicant’s right of defense and fair trial. Thus, in the exercise of its discretion, the
Committee decides that the Eiser Parties shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of
the members of the Committee; the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre made
in advance by the Applicant; and the fees and expenses that the Applicant incurred in

connection with these proceedings.

above, the Eiser Parties shall reimburse the Applicant the expended portion of the advances
on costs, which amounts to US$566,528.18. In addition, the Eiser Parties are ordered to
pay the Applicant’s legal fees and expenses, which amount to US$3,362,315.38 and

on the case account will be reimbursed to Spain.
