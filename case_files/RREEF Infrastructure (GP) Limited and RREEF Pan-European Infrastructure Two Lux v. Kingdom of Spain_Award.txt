Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 15 of 315

I. INTRODUCTION

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’”’) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty
which entered into force on 16 April 1998 (the “ECT” or “Treaty”) and the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18

March 1965, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimants are RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited (“RREEF Infra” or the “First
Claimant”) and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. (“RREEF Pan-

European Two” or the “Second Claimant”), jointly referred as “the Claimants” or “RREEF.”

RREEF Infra is a private limited liability company incorporated in 2005 under the laws of
Jersey. REEF Pan-European Two is a private limited liability company (Société a

responsabilité limitée) incorporated in 2006 under the laws of Luxembourg.

As set forth under the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction, RREEF specialises in
infrastructure investments, with experience across different sectors, including the power
generation sector. RREEF is a member of the Deutsche Bank Group, and in 2013, RREEF
was re-branded and now operates together with Deutsche Bank’s asset and wealth

management divisions, under the unified name Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management.

The First Claimant is the general partner of RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Fund L.P.
(“PEIF”). PEIF holds 100% of the share capital in RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Lux
8.41.1. ((RREEF Pan-European’) and an indirect 100% equity stake, through RREEF Pan-

European, in the Second Claimant.

The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or “the Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 16 of 315

This dispute relates to renewable energy generation installations in Spain.

The Tribunal refers to chapter IV of its Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of
Quantum dated 30 November 2018 for the description of the main facts relating to the merits
of the dispute.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 30 November 2018, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Responsibility and on the
Principles of Quantum, with a Partially Dissenting Opinion from Prof. Volterra (together
“the Decision”). The Tribunal refers to chapter III of this Decision for the previous

procedural history.

On that same date the Secretariat, in accordance with Section 23 of Procedural Order No.1,

invited the Parties to consent to the publication of the Decision on the ICSID’s website.

On 17 January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 on Confidentiality. The
Tribunal ordered the Parties to keep the Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of
Quantum and the attached Partial Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Robert Volterra confidential,
until they reach an agreement on the pending matters of quantum set out in paragraph 600(5)

of the Decision or have informed the Tribunal that they have been unable to do so.

On 7 March 2019, pursuant to paragraph 596 of the Tribunal’s Decision on Responsibility
and on the Principles of Quantum of 30 November 2018, the Tribunal received the Parties’

Experts’ Joint Models quantifying the damages due to the Claimants.

By communication of 12 March 2019, the Claimants asked the Tribunal to provide an
indication of the next steps it intends to take (including the Parties’ submissions on costs),

and their likely timeline.

By communication of 12 March 2019, the Claimants argued that the Respondent was
responsible for leaking the Decision and requested the Tribunal to review Procedural Order

No. 11.

Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 17 of 315

By communication of 12 March 2019, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ allegations,
accepted the disclosure of the Dissenting Opinion and requested the Tribunal to disregard

the Claimants’ comments regarding the Respondent’s breach of the Confidentiality Order.

On 1 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 on Termination of
Confidentiality. The Tribunal found that the confidentiality it had ordered was no longer
necessary and decided that there is no objection to the publication of its Decision on
Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum and the attached Partial Dissenting Opinion

of Professor Robert Volterra.

On 16 August 2018, the Parties filed simultaneous updated submissions on costs.

Ill. DAMAGES
A. CALCULATION OF DAMAGES
The Parties’ Positions

The Parties’ Experts agree on a number of points:

- each of the CSP projects fail to obtain the Tribunal’s target 6.86% after-tax lifetime
project return under the New Regulatory Regime;!

- the incremental cash flow? that is necessary for each of the CSP plants to obtain the
Tribunal’s target 6.86% after-tax lifetime project return;*

- the damages analysis must translate the series of incremental cash flows into present
value figures;*

- using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model and adopting a “Valuation Date” of 30 June

' Brattle-BDO Joint Memorandum, 6 March 2019, para. 4.
? Tbid. “The annual incremental cash flow is the additional amount of cash flow needed in each year after 2013 for
each of the CSP projects to achieve the target 6.86% lifetime return.”

2014, matching their respective expert reports and financial models;>

- projecting cash flows based on the expectations as of the Valuation Date, and discounting
the projected cash flows to the Valuation Date using a discount rate based on market
conditions as of the Valuation Date;°

- Using the same DCF model for the CSP projects to estimate damages for Legitimate
Expectations (CSP) and the same DCF model for the wind projects to estimate damages

for Retroactivity (Wind).”

The Tribunal considers that, even though it is not bound by the experts’ conclusions, there is

no reason to deviate from their common positions.

On the other hand, the Parties disagree on several points regarding the calculation of damages

for CSP Plants and the wind plants.
(a) CSP
1. Applicable Discount Rate
a. The Positions of the Parties’ Experts
i. The Position of the Claimants’ Experts

The Claimants’ Experts continue to apply the same discount rate than the one they proposed
in the earlier phases of the proceedings.* They consider that the Tribunal only calculated a
WACC for the purpose of calculating the reasonable return. According to them, the Tribunal
did not in fact reach any conclusion on the appropriate discount rate in its Decision on

Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum.”

Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 19 of 315

The views of the Claimants’ Experts are that their discounting assumptions are appropriate
for the APV model because the APV requires a discount rate that accounts for the presence

of debt financing in the way that the Claimants’ Experts are proposing. '°
ii. The Position of the Respondent’s Experts

The Respondent’s Experts are calculating the discount rate using the same methodology than
the one the Tribunal used to calculate the reasonable return. They adjust this calculation by
taking into consideration the valuation date agreed by the experts, June 2014, and by

excluding the interest tax shield. They also agree with Claimants’ experts on that last point.!!

The Respondent’s Experts do not discuss whether the methodology used by the Tribunal for

the purpose of calculating the reasonable return would be appropriate for the APV model.
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has calculated a WACC for the purpose of determining what is the reasonable
return for a project, taking “into consideration the financial structure of the whole project.”
In their Joint Report, the Parties’ Experts are calculating a WACC but for a different purpose:
to calculate the damages with the APV method.'* Both Brattle'* and BDO', without
questioning the WACC calculated by the Tribunal, agree that for the purpose of calculating
damages, the WACC should be calculated differently. To that end, they agree to base
themselves on two different parameters: the valuation date'® and the withdrawal of the
interest tax shield'’, There is no reason to oppose their common views, which do not

contradict those of the Tribunal since these parameters are used for another purpose.

27. However, the experts disagree on the methodology to calculate the WACC within the APV
method. But it is to be noted that, while Brattle does propose a complete alternative WACC
to that end, BDO, which agrees that the WACC calculated by the Tribunal for determining
the reasonable return does not fit the APV method, nevertheless uses “the Tribunal’s
valuation methodology and parameters, such as the beta, the financial leverage, cost of debt,
income tax rate, etc”'*. As Brattle rightly states: “The Tribunal did not propose its WACC
for the discount rate.”!? Therefore, there is no objection to adopt a different methodology to
calculate the WACC for evaluating the damages and, in this regard, the Tribunal is of the

view that the WACC calculated by Brattle is more appropriate:

- The Tribunal notes that BDO only calculates its WACC with parameters used by the
Tribunal in its Decision, while acknowledging that the Tribunal’s WACC was calculated
for another purpose, without demonstrating why these parameters would also be relevant
for the calculation of damages;

- In particular, the method used by the Tribunal to calculate the reasonable return does not
appropriately take into account the financing of the debt in a way which should, in all
fairness, be taken into account when evaluating the damages;

- As both Experts agree, it is also necessary to take into account (and deduct) the interest
tax shield, which would not have been appropriate for calculating the return;

- As explained by Brattle, the use of BDO’s WACC results in the appearance of a present
value gain at Arenales under the New Regulatory Regime, while both experts “agree that
each of the CSP projects fail to obtain the Tribunal’s target 6.86% after-tax lifetime
project return under the New Regulatory Regime.””°

- When applying the APV method, it is apposite to take June 2014 as the critical date for

these calculations as both Experts agree.

2, Application of the Illiquidity Discount

a. The Positions of the Parties’ Experts

The Parties’ Experts agree on the magnitude and application of the liquidity discount in the
Actual scenario. Both Experts apply a liquidity discount of 18% when valuing RREEF’s
interests under the New Regulatory Regime. However, the Experts disagree on the
application of the liquidity discount in the scenario reflecting the Tribunal’s target return of

6.86%.!
i. The Position of the Claimants’ Experts

The Claimants’ Experts do not apply a liquidity discount in a scenario assuming the
Tribunal’s target return of 6.86%.” They consider that as the Tribunal calculated the target
by using the WACC, it necessarily assumed the underlying investment interests were
liquid. In other words, the Claimants’ position is that: “if one defines the reasonable return
in a way that excludes an illiquidity premium, but then applies an illiquidity discount when
calculating present values, the result will be the same as if one failed to compensate investors

for the lack of liquidity.”

ii. The Position of the Respondent’s Experts

The Respondent’s Experts do not see any reason why the liquidity discount should not be
applied in the But-For scenario. On the contrary, they consider that the discount should be
applied in both scenarios in order to compare the fair market value of the two plants. In their
opinion, the Tribunal only calculated the project IRR and did not take into account any equity

related factors in its calculation.”>

Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 22 of 315

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

When calculating the damages suffered by the Claimants, both Experts agree “that the
damages should be quantified as the difference of the fair market value of the plants in 2
different scenarios (the Actual and the But-for scenario).”*° In their respective first Reports
both Brattle and BDO referred to the RD 661/2007 regime and applied an illiquidity discount
in both scenarios.”” However, the Experts differed as to whether it was correct to apply an
illiquidity discount in the context of the quantum calculation based on the 6.86% prescribed

reasonable rate of return that was directed to be achieved in the Tribunal’s Decision.

The But-for scenario to be retained at this stage is a scenario according to which the
Claimants would have obtained a reasonable return, as defined by the Tribunal in its
Decision. The opposition between the experts in this respect comes from the fact that the
Claimants’ Experts consider that, since the reasonable return has been defined by the
Tribunal without applying an illiquidity discount, such a discount should not be applied when
calculating the fair market value of the Claimants’ investment in the But-for scenario while
it would still apply in the Actual scenario. The Respondent’s Experts’ opinion on this point

references a discounted cash flow valuation to net present value calculation.

The Tribunal stresses that calculating a damage is a different exercise than calculating a
reasonable return. The Tribunal made a calculation for the purpose of calculating a
reasonable return for a project, not for the purpose of calculating a fair market value, which

was the Experts’ task.

The method of calculating damages is different. It consists in calculating first the value of
the investment in the “but for” scenario without taking into account the breach of the treaty
and then, in a second step, the value of the investment in the Actual scenario (taking into
account the violations). The damage corresponds to subtracting this amount from the

previous one. To calculate the value of the investment, it is normal to add an “illiquidity

discount” which adjusts the value of the company on the grounds that it is not, or only
slightly, liquid (because it cannot be easily sold). But the illiquidity discount should only be
added to calculate the fair market value, i.e. the estimated sale value of an asset. There is no
reason to add one to calculate the internal rate of return of a project. Such an addition in only
one of two scenarios totally distorts the comparison with the current scenario, keeping in
mind that, in the present case, there is no expropriation or damages against the investment

itself.

When defining the methodology to calculate the reasonable return, the Tribunal explained:

“There can be no doubt that the ECT protects shareholder interests. As

such, it ensures to them the right to a fair and equitable treatment,

including the respect of their legitimate expectations. As the Tribunal

already explained, the only legitimate expectations the Claimants had

in this case was to obtain the reasonable return that the Respondent was

committed to. It is therefore necessary to look precisely at the

Respondent’s commitment. Both the Claimants and the Respondent

agree that the reasonable return targeted by the Spanish law is a project

IRR. The Tribunal see no reason to decide otherwise.””*
An illiquidity discount represents the lack of liquidity of an asset. The issue of the liquidity
of an asset only arises when calculating the fair market value of an investment, from the
investors’ point of view (the market). Therefore, as in the present case the Tribunal has
considered that a reasonable return had to be calculated for a project, there was logically no
basis for applying an illiquidity discount in the calculation of the reasonable return to the
projects guaranteed by the Respondent. In the view of the Tribunal, there is no reason why

the reasonable return calculation would “compensate” for a lack of liquidity.

On the contrary, it is necessary to add this discount when calculating the fair market value in

both scenarios as the Experts have done in all their previous calculations” and as BDO,*?

in one scenario completely biases the comparison of the two scenarios.

3. Offset Damages at the Andasol Plants with a Possible Gain at Arenales

a. The Positions of the Parties’ Experts
i. The Position of the Claimants’ Experts

The Claimants’ Experts point out that the Respondent’s Experts’ use of a lower discount rate
artificially exaggerates the supposed difference between effects on different assets of the
Claimants, under the principles enunciated by the Tribunal in the Decision. They point out
that whether or not to include negative damages into a quantum calculation is a legal question

and not an economic one.*”
ii. The Position of the Respondent’s Experts

The Respondent’s experts point out that as a consequence of the preferred share scheme in
force, RREEF had the ability to collect cash distributions from Arenales prior to other
shareholders. Taking into account that the damages are calculated as the sum of the impact
on the three plants, they consider that all the elements, together those that increase the
damages and those that reduce them, including the effect of the said preferred share scheme,

should be taken into account in the damages’ calculation.

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes that, when applying the discount rate proposed by Brattle as the Tribunal
deems appropriate,*? it appears that Arenales did not earn money, and therefore the question
of the deduction of its gain from the losses suffered by the Claimants with Andasol does not
arise.

(b) Wind Plants

1. Applicable Discount Rate

The Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the line of argument followed in respect to the
applicable discount rate (under III.A.(a) 1. above). The same discount rate should be applied

for both the CSP and the wind plants.

2. Inflation Indexing

a. The Positions of the Parties’ Experts

While the Parties’ Experts agree that retroactivity damages should not reflect a change in the
calculation of the return and that the relevant analysis should only attempt to eliminate the
clawback of historical profits under the New Regulatory Regime, they disagree about
precisely how to eliminate the claw-back of historical profits under the New Regulatory

Regime.**
i. The Position of the Claimants’ Experts

The Claimants’ Experts note that the remuneration that the Claimants received under the
previous regime was indexed on the inflation, contrary to the remuneration under the New
Regime that is not indexed on inflation. They consider that given the same target rate of

return, the choice to index for inflation affects the anticipated profile of payments over time

Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 26 of 315

and the implicit profile of capital repayment. According to them, the “treatment of inflation”

is an inherent part of the retroactivity identified by the Tribunal as a breach.*>
ii. The Position of the Respondent’s Experts

44. The Respondent’s experts refer to the Tribunal’s Decision*® and note that the Tribunal did
not indicate that any inflation matters had to be corrected and they consider that, as the
reasonable return of 7.398% is a nominal rate of return, it already takes inflation into

account.”
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

45. Asareminder: the Tribunal found in its Decision that the New Regime is retroactive because:
- It grants the investors a 7.398% return per year;
- The Claimants received more in the early years (before 2014) as they were under the old
regime;
- As aresult, Spain considered that the Claimants will have less than 7.398% in the future

(after 2014) in order to compensate for the surplus that they had under the old regime.

46. In order to calculate the damages suffered by the Claimants, it is therefore necessary, as

proposed by the Claimants’ Experts, to attribute to them the difference between:

- what they earned under the old regime and;

- the 7.398% target.

Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 27 of 315

B. THE REQUESTED TAX-GRoss UP
a. The Parties’ Positions
i. The Claimants’ Position

To achieve full reparation, the Claimants request that the Tribunal also order compensation
including a tax gross-up of 29.22%, corresponding to the Luxembourg corporate tax rate
applicable to any amounts received by the Claimants under the award.** Brattle estimated a

tax gross-up of EUR 115 million.”

The Claimants argue that Article 21 of the ECT is no obstacle for the Tribunal to award the
tax gross-up. Contrary to Respondent’s assertion, Article 21 of the ECT is concerned with
whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction over a dispute where a State measure can be
characterized as taxation, which is a question unrelated to the application of a tax gross-up

on damages under the Award.*?

Also, the tax gross-up is not speculative. Contrary to the Respondent’s assertion, it does not
fall under the EU’s participation exemption of profit distribution between subsidiaries within
the EU. Moreover, the Claimants have computed a specific tax gross-up claim for a specific
country, Luxembourg; unlike the claimants in Mobil v. Venezuela - the case referenced by
the Respondent - whose claims were found to lack specificity when they contended that there

was a risk that other jurisdictions seek to impose taxes.*!

The Claimants then suggest three ways in which the Tribunal could address the issue of the
tax gross-up. The Claimants suggest placing the full amount of the gross-up in escrow,

pending the final determination by a tax authority; or the appropriate entity could provide a

written undertaking that any amount not paid to the tax office would be returned to Spain; or

order the Respondent to hold the Claimants harmless from any tax due.”
ii. The Respondent’s Position

Regarding the tax gross-up, the Respondent argues that it is excluded under Article 21 of the
ECT, which establishes a tax gross-up carve out, by providing that nothing in the ECT shall
create rights or impose obligations about taxation measures of the Contracting Parties. The
Contracting Parties, according to the Respondent, should be understood here as either the
home or the host country of the investor, which follows from the distinction made in Article
15 of the ECT. Luxembourg is an ECT Contracting Party and has not consented to subject
tax-related matters to arbitration upon signing the ECT. The Tribunal would lack jurisdiction
to assess the tax gross-up, being a tax measure. Also, Article 21 states that in case of
inconsistency, it prevails over other provisions of the ECT, including Articles 10 and 13 or
Article 26. Also, consistent with Article 2 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States
of the ILC and its Comment (1), pursuant to which the conduct or act must be attributable to
the State under international law, no tax measure of Luxembourg could create an obligation
for Spain based on the ECT. With support in Rusoro v. Venezuela, the Respondent argues
that tax obligations derived from tax laws different from those of the host country do not

qualify as consequential loss and the host country cannot be liable for them.*?

Alternatively, no tax on the amount awarded would arise in Luxembourg. _ First,
compensation for income that was not received falls under the EU’s participation exemption,
which provides for the exemption of profit distributions between parent companies and

subsidiaries of different EU Member States.**

Alternatively, if the Tribunal does not find that Article 21 has a tax gross-up carve out and
that no tax exemption applied, the Respondent argues that applying the tax gross-up is

inappropriate, since it is speculative and uncertain. The Claimants have failed to supply legal

basis with regard to Luxembourg’s hypothetical taxation and Claimants themselves say in
their Reply that it is not possible to know with certainty the decision of the Luxembourg tax
authority. With support on Mobil v. Venezuela, the Claimants argue that regarding foreign
taxation, a tax gross-up claim is speculative and uncertain. Similarly, the Respondent argues
that the tribunal in Abengoa v. Mexico found that the claimants had fail to provide any
evidence of possible double taxation and the tribunal could not speculate on the tax

treatment.*>
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

54. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that Article 21 is irrelevant to the present discussion:
the hypothetical taxes for which they ask compensation are not the consequences of the ECT,
but would be the consequence of a more general obligation to pay taxes on benefits made by
the Claimants and repatriated (if repatriated) in Luxembourg. However, the benefits from
which the Claimants have been wrongfully deprived would, most probably, have been
submitted to taxation had the Claimants integrally received the sum due to them in

accordance with their legitimate expectations.

55. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have not provided sufficient evidence of
whether and in what amount any tax on the compensation determined by this Award would
have to be paid by them*®. Accordingly, the harm the Claimants complain of is uncertain

and hypothetical and cannot give rise to compensation.
C. COMPENSATION DUE TO THE CLAIMANTS

56. The Claimants are entitled to compensation for the harm caused by the Respondent’s
wrongful acts as determined in the Tribunal’s Decision, that is, resulting from its breaches
of its obligations under the ECT for the retroactive application of the New Regime with
respect to the Wind plants and the CSP plants belonging to the Claimants and, with respect

to each of the CSP Plants, of its obligation to insure a reasonable return to the Claimants’

investment. In view of the above, the Tribunal considers that the damages must be calculated
in conformity with the Claimants’ Experts’ discount rate*” as well as by applying an
illiquidity discount in both scenarios for CSP plants*® and by taking into account inflation

indexation for wind plants.”

According to the agreed Experts’ calculations, the damages that the Respondent shall pay to
the Claimants are equivalent to EUR 58,5 million for the CSP plants*° and to EUR 1,1 million

for the wind plants>!.
D. INTEREST
a. The Parties’ Positions
i. The Claimants’ Position

To achieve full compensation, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal must award pre- and
post-award interest on the amounts due. The Claimants refer to Article 13 of the ECT, which
provides for interest at a commercial rate established at a market basis from the date of
expropriation until date of payment which, they argue, is also an appropriate benchmark for
damages resulting from ECT breaches other than expropriation. The Claimants also refer to
Article 38 of the ILC Articles, under which interest on a sum due shall be payable to ensure
full compensation, running from the date when the sum is due until the date of payment.**
The Claimants assert that the Respondent did not contest that the principle of full reparation

requires that interest be paid on any damages awarded.**

The Claimants maintain that the Tribunal should adopt different interest rates for pre- and

post-award interest. Pre-award interest serves to achieve full reparation, while post-award

Case 1:19-cv-03783-CJN Document 1-1 Filed 12/19/19 Page 31 of 315

interest serves as incentive to promptly pay the amounts due under the award and prevent

unjust enrichment.**

For pre-award interest, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal should calculate the interest at
Spain’s borrowing rate (based on the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds), which affords full
reparation and corresponds to a commercial rate established on a market basis within the
meaning of the ECT.» That rate for the relevant period amounts to 2.07%, compounded
monthly.*® In Brattle’s Rebuttal Report, the amounts to pay for pre-award interest were

calculated as EUR 14 million.*”

The Claimants contest the 2-year borrowing rate suggested by the Respondent for pre-award
interest, linked to the time elapsed between the valuation date as at June 2014 and the Award.
The Claimants consider that such rate has no support, while the 10-year bond is a commercial
rate established on a market basis and that even BDO used in several parts of its own reports.
Also, Spain’s 10-year bond yields are considerably lower than the rates at which the Project
Companies can borrow funds in Spain, so any interest rate lower than the one chosen by the
Claimants would cease to be a commercial rate. Finally, in any case, more than 2 years have
elapsed since June 2014 and more time will continue to elapse until the award is made,

making the 2-year borrowing rate inappropriate.**

For post-award interest, the Claimants request that the Tribunal uses a rate higher than 2.07%
also compounded on a monthly basis. Contrary to Respondent’s assertion, the Claimants
argue that payment of post-award interest is neither punitive nor inconsistent with Article 36
of the ILC Articles. The Respondent, according to the Claimants, fails to distinguish between

the nature of compensation — which includes payment of compensation and pre-award

interest — and the purpose of post award interest to incentivize compliance with the award,

as explained in Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe and in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela.”
ii. The Respondent’s Position

If the Tribunal found that there are damages, the Respondent asserts that for pre-award
interest, the Tribunal should not opt for a 10-year bond, but instead consider the bond to a
period of approximately 2 years, equivalent to the gap between the appraisal date and the
date of the award, as considered in BDO’s report. Additionally, the Respondent argues
that such rate should be a risk-free rate, as it is not logical to compensate for a risk that has

not yet incurred.*!

For post-award interest, the Respondent opposes to a rate higher than 2.07%, which would
have a punitive character and lacks legal basis. With support on the Commentary (4) on
Article 36 of the ILC Articles, the Respondent maintains that compensation should
correspond to financially assessable damages and not to punish the responsible State.
Further, the Respondent references the decision in Vestey v. Venezuela, according to which
post-award interest seeks to account for the risk of repairing a hypothetical breach of ICSID
Convention, while the tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on breaches of the relevant treaty.
The Respondent also references National Grid v. Argentina according to which the function
of post-award interest is to protect the value of the award from inflation and so a risk-free
rate should apply. Finally, the Respondent referenced Micula v. Romania where the tribunal
saw no reason to treat differently the cost of the deprivation of money before or after the

award and applied the same rate to pre- and post-award interest.

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Interests (whether pre or post award) are a necessary consequence of the principle of full
reparation. They are a compensation for the damage suffered by the loss of use of the
principal sum during the period for which the payment thereof continued to be withheld. As
noted by the Middle East Cement v. Egypt tribunal, “[i]nternational jurisprudence and
literature have recently, after detailed consideration, concluded that interest is an integral part
of the compensation due.” Interests have the function to reimburse the Claimant(s) for the
delay in the payment of funds owed because “compensation must not be eroded by the
passage of time or by the diminution in the market value”®. Therefore, interests are awarded
to ensure that the present value of the judgment equals the present value of the harm and the
start date for the prejudgment interests should be the date of breach or loss®. In this matter,
the Arbitral Tribunal shares the view of the tribunal in Micula v. Romania which did “not
see why the cost of the deprivation of money (which interest compensates) should be
different before and after the Award [...]. Both are awarded to compensate a party for the
deprivation of the use of its funds.”©’ Consequently, interests should be paid from the date
of the occurrence of the damages until that of the payment and there is no reason to make a
distinction between the pre-Award and post-Award interests; in both cases, the purpose is to
make good of the harm caused to the Claimants by the breaches of the Respondent’s

obligations.

This is in keeping with Article 38 of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for

Internationally Wrongful Acts:

“J. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be
payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest
rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.

2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been
paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.”

Moreover, this has been the general practice of ICSID tribunals.

Although it is conscious that there is no jurisprudence constante as to the choice between
compound or simple interest, the Tribunal shares the view of the Santa Elena v. Costa Rica

tribunal:

“[W]here an owner of property has at some earlier time lost [whether
fully or partly] the value of his asset but has not received the monetary
equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of compensation
should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would
have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested
each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.”

In other words, “compound interest better reflects current business and economic realities
70

and therefore the actual damage suffered by a party.
The Tribunal notes the ICSID Convention gives no guidance concerning the question of the
interest rate to be retained and the jurisprudence in this respect is anything but “constante”.
Although Article 13(1) of the ECT, which provides for interest at a commercial rate
established at a market basis, only applies in case of expropriation —which is not at stake in
this case, this provision can constitute a guidance by analogy. And the Tribunal shares the
view of the Claimants which suggest to calculate the interest at Spain’s borrowing rate (based
on the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds), which is appropriate to afford full reparation in the
framework of a private investment realized on a market basis (all the more so taking into
consideration the time which has elapsed between the occurrence of the harm and the date of
the Award). According to the Claimants’, that rate for the relevant period amounts to 2.07%,

compounded monthly.”! This figure has not been challenged as such by the Respondent.

70. In their updated submission(s) on costs, the Claimants argue that the Respondent should bear
the total arbitration costs incurred by Claimants, including legal fees and expenses, totalling

£5,996,252.46.”

71. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs and that it
should make an award on costs in their favour, taking into consideration that: (i) the
Respondent committed several breaches of its obligations under the ECT in relation to the

Claimants’ investment, and (ii) the Respondent’s jurisdictional challenges lacked merit.”

72. The Claimants claim that, “as the Tribunal confirmed in its Decision on Responsibility and

on the Principles of Quantum, the Respondent committed a number of breaches of its
international law obligations under the ECT in relation to RREEF's investment in Spain.””*
and that, they are entitled to their costs on a full indemnity basis, as such compensation is
necessary to reinstate the Claimants to the position they would have been in but for the

Respondent’s breaches of the ECT.”°

75. The Respondent submits that the costs incurred by the Respondent should be paid by the
Claimants in the case that the Tribunal decides not to uphold the Claimants’ claim. The

Respondent considers that:

“the Claimants would not be covered by International Law and the
costs incurred by the Respondent for its defense come from Spanish
taxpayers and could have been used in other public needs instead.
Therefore, the result of this arbitration should be neutral for the Spanish
public budget.”””

bona fide during the proceedings and points out several of the Claimants’ acts:7*

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 61 of the ICSID Convention gives the Tribunal complete discretion with respect to
allocation of the costs among the parties but provides no guidance on how that discretion is
to be exercised. Arbitration Rules 28 and 47 refer to costs, but they give no guidance either

on how such costs are to be apportioned.

. It is generally accepted that, in principle, the loser must pay all the costs. However, this

principle hardly applies when neither party can be considered totally winning or totally
losing. Likewise, when the outcome of the litigation is difficult to predict due to the novelty
or difficulty of the dispute or because there is no established trend in case law. In such a
case, it can hardly be considered that the Claimants acted frivolously when deciding to
litigate and the principle “loser pays” has no support when neither party has been totally

defeated and/or when the loser had well-grounded reasons to litigate.

These two reasons are valid in this case. Neither in matters of jurisdiction nor in questions
of merit, neither party was totally defeated. Both were partly winners and partly losers on
the various issues that the Tribunal had to resolve. Equally, the litigation has dealt with novel
matters, with respect to which the arbitral case law has been quite inconsistent. Moreover,
the discussion of the factual and legal issues by both Parties and their Experts have been
extremely helpful and the Tribunal would like to acknowledge the special assistance
provided by the parties’ Experts’ Joint Models quantifying the damages due to the Claimants.
This is in line with an abundant case-law according to which “it is equitable in this matter
for each party to bear its own costs and fees, as well as half the advance payments made to

ICSID.””

Accordingly, each party should share equally the costs of the arbitral proceeding and each

shall bear individually the other legal costs and expenses that they have incurred.

Vv. AWARD

30 November 2018 and the body of this Award, the Tribunal hereby declares, orders and
