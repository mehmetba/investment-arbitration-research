Background

The Claimants are citizens of Belgium and the sole shareholders of Berschader
International S.A. (“BI”), a company organised under the laws of Belgium and
engaged in the business of construction and general contracting.

According to the Request for Arbitration, in 1994 the Supreme Court of the
Russian Federation (the “Supreme Court”) issued a public tender for the
construction of new court facilities and reconstruction of existing buildings in

Moscow. BI participated in the tender process and ultimately won the tender.

On 20 December 1994, BI, as Contractor, and the Supreme Court, as
Employer-Investor, signed a contract designated BI/VS-I (the “Contract”) for
the construction and remodelling of the Supreme Court’s building complex (the
“Buildings”).

According to the Claimants, BI fulfilled its obligations under the Contract,

luding the ion of all ions works, to the satisfaction of the
Respondent. The Clai allege, t ;, that the Sup Court
accumulated substantial late payments under the Contract resulting in delays in
the completion of the project. The Claimants further allege that the Supreme
Court failed to pay BI upon the completion of the construction works
contemplated under the Contract. BI then exercised its right of retention under
the Russian Civil Code to retain possession of the Buildings until outstanding
sums had been paid in full.

The Claimants further assert that on 29 August 2001 the Administration of the
President of the Russian Federation (the “Presidential Administration”) issued
a letter to BI, purporting to annul the Contract on the grounds of delays to the

completion of the construction works,

+46 8 50576501

4(75)

On 21 September 2001, BI notified the Presidential Administration that the
action taken by the latter in annulling the Contract amounted to a violation of
the Agreement between the Governments of the Kingdom of Belgium and the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Soviet Union on the Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investment of 9 February 1989 (the “Treaty”). Further
letters were sent by BI to the Supreme Court and the Cabinet of Ministers of
the Russian Federation on 24 September 2001 and the 2 October 2001
respectively.

The Claimants allege that on 31 October 2001 the Ministry of Internal Affairs

of the Russian Federation issued a police order ejecting all personnel of BI and

its security service from the project site. The Supreme Court is alleged to have
bsequently taken physical p ion of the Buildings and moved its

activities there.

Negotiations between BI and the Respondent ensued and resulted in
Supplemental Agreement No. 2 of 24 December 2001 (the “Supplemental

Agi ”), In the Suppl 1 Agi the Respondent and BI agreed
that the Supreme Court owed US $5,673,763 to BI (the “Agreed Debt”). On 29
December 2001, the Respondent paid US $341,487 to BI in partial settlement
of this sum. Despite further negotiations between BI and the Respondent, the

Claimants allege that no further payment has been made by the Respondent.

On 4 July 2002, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court revoked BI’s construction

licence.

On 4 March 2003, BI was placed in bankruptcy and is currently under the
supervision of a receiver pending the outcome of reorganisation proceedings in

Belgium.

The proceedings

Request for arbitration and appointment of arbitral tribunal

On 26 August 2004, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration to the
Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the “Institute”’)
in reliance upon Article 2 and Article 10 of the Treaty.

In the Request for Arbitration, the Claimants seek the following relief:

i. a declaration that the Respondent has breached Articles 2, 4(1), 4(2)
and 5 of the Treaty;

ii. compensation from the Respondent in the amount of

US$13,287,147, converted into euros at the most favourable rate in

force during the period 24 December 2001 to the date of payment;

interest on US$13,287,147 from 24 December 2001 until the date of

payment at the rate of 1/300 of the re-financing rate of the Central

Bank of the Russian Federation per day, compounded quarterly;

iv. any other losses suffered as a direct result of the Respondent’s

breaches of the Treaty;

iii.

In the Request for Arbitration, Claimants further notified the Institute of the
appointment of Professor Todd Weiler as arbitrator.

jurisdiction over the dispute and appointed Professor A.S. Komarov as
arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent.

On 15 November 2004, Professor Komarov resigned. On 26 November 2004,
the Institute notified the parties that, due to Professor Komarov’s resignation,
the Institute was appointing Professor S.N. Lebedev as arbitrator on behalf of
the Respondent.

On 4 November 2004, the Institute appointed Advokat Bengt Sjévall as
Chairman of the arbitral tribunal (“Chairman”) and referred the case to the
arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”). The Institute also fixed the advance on costs
at €255,000 in accordance with Article 14 of the Rules of the Arbitration
Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the “SCC Rules”).

The Claimants paid their share of the advance on costs in the amount of
€127,000. In a letter dated 17 December 2004, the Respondent refused to pay
its share on the grounds that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the dispute.
Accordingly, the Claimant disch d the ining portion of the advance on

costs on 17 December 2004.

Challenge to the impartiality of Professor Lebedev

On 23 D ber 2004, the Clai bitted a chall to the appoii
of Professor Lebedev.

 

In a letter to the Insti dated 27 D ber 2004, the Respond jected
the Claimant’s challenge and objected to the removal of Professor Lebedev.

In a letter to the Institute on 8 January 2005, Professor Lebedev also objected

to his removal.

On 31 January 2005, the Institute rendered its decision on the challenge to the
appointment of Professor Lebedev. The Institute found that there were no
grounds for removing Professor Lebedev and the Claimant’s challenge was,

accordingly, dismissed.

Decision on language of the arbitration

On 15 February 2005, the Tribunal issued the First Procedural Order
requesting, inter alia, that the Claimants submit a Statement of Claim not later
than 15 April 2005, that the Respondent submit a Statement of Defence not
later than 15 June 2005. The parties were also ordered to forthwith present any
views they may have on the language to be used in the arbitration,

In a letter dated 22 February 2005, the Respondent stated its view that the
Russian language should be the language of the arbitral proceedings. In a letter
dated 25 February 2005, the Claimants responded and stated their preference
that English be designated as the sole language for the arbitral proceedings.

In two further letters dated 28 February 2005 and 1 March 2005, the
Respondent further developed its view on the language to be used in the
arbitration. In a letter dated 2 March 2005, the Claimants responded to the
views contained in the Respondent's letters dated 28 February 2005 and 1
March 2005 and reaffirmed its position as set out in the letter dated 25
February 2005.

In a decision rendered in Stockholm on 16 March 2005, the Tribunal held that
the English language was to be designated as the official working language of
the arbitration, but that each party was entitled to submit written arguments and
supporting evidence in the Russian language and to make oral arguments in the
Russian language, upon the condition that translation and interpretation into
English was provided where necessary.

The Respondent’s challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal may be

summarised under the following five principal arguments:

a. The Claimants have not observed the pre-arbitration settlement procedure
provided for under Article 10.1 of the Treaty;

b. The Claimants have not made “investments” within the meaning of Article
1.2 of the Treaty;

c. The Claimants are not “investors” within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the
Treaty;

d. The Claimants’ claim does not fall within the scope of the arbitration clause
contained in Article 10 of the Treaty; and

e. The Claimants’ claim constitutes a fraud on BI.

The Claimants have not complied with pre-arbitration procedures

The Respondent has submitted that the case submitted by the Claimants cannot
be decided by the Tribunal before the pre-arbitration settlement procedures
provided for under Article 10 of the Treaty have been observed. The
Respondent maintains, in particular, that the Tribunal may only consider the
case if a detailed written notice has been submitted by the investor to the State

and such written notice has been accompanied by a detailed memorandum.

In this particular case, it is argued that the Claimants themselves have not
submitted any written notice to the Respondent. The letters, upon which the
Claimants rely as written notices fulfilling the Treaty requirements, are said to
have been sent by the company BI and not by the Claimants in their separate
capacity as i . The Respondent further ds that the pany BI
cannot be considered as a representative of the Claimants for this purpose.

 

Moreover, the Respondent contends that the letters relied upon by the
Claimants have not been duly served on the Respondent. The letters are said to

have been sent not to the Respondent, but rather to separate governmental
bodies of the Russian Federation. The Respondent further maintains that none
of these go’ 1 bodies were appointed by the Respondent as a

representative for conducting negotiations with BI.

In reliance upon Article 16 of the European Convention on State Immunity, the
Respondent insists that notice of a dispute can only be deemed properly served
upon a defendant State if such notice is sent directly through the diplomatic
channel to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In disputes involving States, the
Respond intains that strict adh to the procedural rules on service is
of great importance. In this context, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’
attempted notifications have been made in violation of the principle of

sovereign equality of states and respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty.

Finally, the Respondent argues that the notices sent by BI cannot constitute
notices of this dispute under Article 10 of the Treaty since the dispute between
BI and the Respondent is different from the current dispute between the

Clai and the Respondent, As an le of the diff b the
two disputes, the Respondent alleges that BI has certain tax liabilities which it
owes to the Russian Federation and which the Respondent could seek to

recover as a counter-claim in any dispute with BI.

The Claimants have not made investments within the meaning of the
Treaty

The Respondent argues that Article 1.2 of the Russian language text of the
Treaty speaks of kapitalovlozhenie and vlozhit which terms restrict qualifying
investments to “capital investments” in Russian. Capital investments
(kapitalovlozhenie), ding to the Respondent, are to be distinguished from

“investments” and comprise of property assets which must be contributed to
the charter capital of a joint venture company in accordance with the legislation

of the Russian Federation. The Respondent submits that these criteria have not

been satisfied in the instant case.

The Respondent maintains that none of the investments relied upon by the
Claimants in the instant case can be considered as property assets which
“investors of one Contracting Party contribute in the territory of another
Contracting Party” in accordance with Article 1.2 of the Treaty.

The Respondent concedes that the French text of the Treaty does not contain
the same limitation on the term “investment” as the Russian text establishes.
Since both texts are of equal legal force, the Respondent argues that the
meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and
purpose of the Treaty must be adopted in accordance with Article 33 of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969. The Respondent submits
that the best way to reconcile both texts would be to choose the more restrictive

Russian definition of the term “investment”.

The Respondent further points out that Article 1.2 of the Treaty refers to
investments made in accordance with the laws of the host State. The
Respondent contends that this reference means that the Treaty only grants
Pp to capital i made in d with the laws of the
Russian Federation. The Respondent argues that since BI’s construction licence
was revoked by the Arbitration Court of the City of Moscow on the grounds of
violation of Article 9 of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation, the
investments relied upon by the Claimants are illegal and are not encompassed

by Article 1.2. of the Treaty.

The Claimants are not investors within the meaning of the Treaty

The Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot be considered “investors”
within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the Treaty. The Respondent argues that the

Claimants as physical persons did not implement any capital investments in the

territory of the Russian Federation.

The Claimants’ acquisition of shares in B] was performed in the territory of
Belgium and hence cannot be considered as a capital investment in the territory
of the Russian Federation. The Contract was concluded by BI and not by the
Claimants. The adjusted debt is owed to BI and not to the Claimants and the
right of retention in the Buildings is that of BI’s and not the Claimants’.

The Respondent argues that the protection offered to indirect investments
under the Treaty is limited to the second paragraph of Article 1.2, whereby the
term investment is stated to include indirect investments made by investors
from one of the Contracting Parties in the territory of the other Contracting
Party by the intermediary of an investor of a third state. Accordingly, if capital
had been impl d by the Clai through a company of a
third state, the Claimants would be considered investors under the terms of the
Treaty. The Respondent argues that the reason that investments carried out by
investors through a company of their home state are not covered by the Treaty
is that the Treaty affords protection to the company itself in such instances. In
other words, the investors’ interests are protected by the fact that the company
can rely upon the Treaty and there is, hence, no need for the investors
themselves to be able to rely upon the Treaty. This is to be contrasted with the
case of investments implemented through a third state intermediary where such

intermediary has no right to rely upon the Treaty.

The claims cannot be subject to Treaty arbitration

The Respondent submits that only disputes as to the amount or mode of
compensation for an act of expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty may be
submitted to arbitration under Article 10 of the Treaty and that the issue of
whether or not an act of expropriation took place is to be decided by a Russian

arbitration court. The Respondent argues that this conclusion arises clearly

from the express wording of Article 10.1 of the Treaty.

The Respondent contends that the Soviet Union proceeded on the basis that the
question of the presence or absence of an act of expropriation must in every
particular case be decided by the national court of the state in the territory of
which the expropriation was alleged to have taken place. The Respondent
maintains that this was a point of principle of the Soviet Union and relies upon
the dispute settlement provisions of all the treaties concluded by the Soviet

Union in support of this contention.

The Respondent further contends that the MFN clause contained in Article 2 of
the Treaty cannot encompass the dispute settlement provisions of the Treaty.

The Respondent relies upon the text of the Protocol to the Treaty in this regard
and maintains that, in accordance therewith, the scope of the MFN treatment is
limited to treatment granted to states which were OECD members as of 9
February 1989. As of 9 February 1989, the Soviet Union had no Treaties on the
protection of capital investments with any of the OECD member states and,
accordingly, the provisions of other treaties on the protection of capital
investments between the Soviet Union and other states cannot be incorporated
into the Treaty.

The Respondent also maintains that regard must be had to the phrase “[iJn the
territory of the Soviet Union” as contained in the Protocol to the Treaty. The
Respondent contends that this phrase clearly indicates that any attempt to
expand the scope of implementation of the Protocol is limited to the territory of
the Soviet Union or, more particularly, to those treaties on protection of capital
investments that were signed by the Soviet Union. In this context, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant is not entitled to rely on the provisions of
the BIT entered into between Norway and the Russian Federation, since this

treaty relates not to the territory of the Soviet Union but rather to the much
smaller territory of the Russian Federation.

Moreover, the Respondent argues that, under the terms of the Contract, it is the
Internationa] Commercial Arbitration Court at the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry at the Russian Federation (the “Russian Arbitration Court”) which has
jurisdiction to hear this particular dispute and that the activities contemplated
by the Contract do not fall within the scope of the Treaty. The Respondent
claims that where the Russian Arbitration Court decides that the dispute
concerning compulsory expropriation constitutes a dispute arising out of the
Contract, such dispute is to be settled by the Russian Arbitration Court and not
this Tribunal.

The Claimants’ claim constitutes a fraud on BI

The Respondent further points out that BI is incorporated in Belgium and has
every possibility to bring an action under the Treaty and under the Contract to
which it is a party. The Respondent maintains that, since the company is in
bankruptcy, its receiver has full powers and authority to bring such an action
on behalf of the company. Such action, if successful, would benefit all of the
company’s creditors and shareholders and not only the Claimants.

The Respondent submits that the claims presented by the Claimants in this
arbitration are not personal, but are rather those of BI. The Respondents argues
that under Belgian law only BI, as duly represented by its bankruptcy receiver,
is entitled to bring the present claims against the Respondent. The Respondent,
therefore, argues that by bringing this claim in lieu of the company the
Claimants are committing a fraud under Belgian bankruptcy law and under

international public order.

Claimants’ submissions on jurisdiction

Claimants have complied with pre-arbitration procedures

The Claimants argue that they have provided three notices of dispute, each of
which satisfied the requirements of Article 10 of the Treaty. On 21 September
2001, the Claimants are said to have sent a letter to the Presidential
Administration through BI, giving notice that the action taken by the
Presidential Administration in annulling the Contract amounted to a violation
of the Treaty and that if compensation was not provided promptly, the dispute
would be submitted to arbitration under the Treaty. On 2 October 2001, the
Claimants claim to have submitted a similar letter to the Government of the
Russian Federation through BI, which included a copy of the Notice of Dispute
and reminded the Russian Federation of its obligations under the Treaty.
Finally, on 9 March 2004, BI sent a letter to the Prime Minister of the Russian
Federation informing him of the factual circumstances surrounding the dispute
and calling for compensation on the basis of the protection set out in the Treaty
failing which arbitration proceedings would be initiated under the Treaty.

The Claimants contend that each notice described in detail the factual
circumstances surrounding the dispute and the current claims presented under
the Treaty. In this context, the Claimants argue that the Respondent had ample
notice of the Claimants’ grievances, and sufficient information to take the steps

necessary to achieve an amicable settlement.

The Claimants further reject the Respondent’s contention that notice must be
sent through diplomatic channels in order to be effective. The Claimants argue
that this contention is frivolous and based exclusively upon the European
Convention on State Immunity, to which the Respondent is not a party and
which has no relevance to arbitral proceedings, since it applies only to
litigation in national courts. In the context of investor-State arbitration under

BITs, the Claimants submit that service of process through diplomatic channels
is unheard of.

73. The Claimants further contend that it is irrelevant whether the three notices of
dispute were served upon the Respondent by the Claimants in their official
capacity as officers of BI, or in their individual capacity as future claimants in
the present dispute. Relying upon, inter alia, the decision of the Permanent
Court of International Justice in The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, the
Claimants argue that international tribunals have taken a flexible approach to
the pre-arbitration notice and negotiation provisions of BITs. The Claimants
maintain that the notices of dispute “defined all the points at issue” between the
parties and hence satisfy the Treaty’s pre-arbitration requirements regardless of
whether BI or its owners sent them.

74. During the course of the oral hearing, the Claimants insisted that the dispute
between BI and the Respondent is the same as the current dispute between the
Claimants and the Respondent. Accordingly, the dispute set out in the notices
relied upon by the Claimants is identical to the current dispute before the
Arbitral Tribunal.

75. Finally, the Claimants submit that even if there was any formal defect in the
Claimants’ observance of the pre-arbitration procedures contained in Article 10
of the Treaty, such defect should have no effect on the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. The Claimants rely upon a number of cases including Nicaragua v
United States of America® and Lauder v Czech Republic’ and contend that
arbitrators have followed the long-established rule of international law that pre-
arbitration negotiation provisions are purely procedural in nature, and that an
international tribunal cannot allow itself to be hampered by a mere defect of

form. Accordingly, the Claimants maintain that irrespective of whether or not
the Claimants observed the precise modalities of the Treaty’s pre-arbitration
procedures, the Respondent was clearly notified of the dispute beforehand, and

since December 2001 has showed no interest in settlement.

The Claimants have made investments within the meaning of the Treaty

The Claimants maintain that Russian law has no bearing upon the definition of
“investments” under the Treaty, The Claimants further argue that the
Respondent’s attempt to restrict the meaning of the term “investments” to
capital investments capable of contribution to the charter capital of a joint
venture constitutes a transparent distortion of the Russian language and is

inconsistent with the French text of the Treaty.

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal need look no further than the French
version of the Treaty itself for the proper translation of the Russian terms
kapitalovlozhenie and viozhit. The French text uses the words investissement
and investir which are identical to the ordinary meaning of the English terms
‘fnvestment” and “to invest”. The Claimants refute the Respondent’s
contention that in the event of such contradiction, the narrower Russian
language definition must be adopted. The Claimants maintain that in the event
of any divergence between the French and Russian texts, the proper meaning
under the Vienna Convention is the one “which best reconciles the texts, with
regard to the object and purpose of the treaty.” The Claimants argue that the
Respondent’s narrow definition of the terms “i ” and “invest” is
clearly incompatible with the Treaty’s aim of promoting investment and is

creating favourable conditions for investment as set out in the Preamble.

The Claimants further contest the correctness of the Respondent’s translation
of the terms kapitalovlozhenie and viozhit, arguing that the terms are, in fact,

universally translated as “investment” and “to invest”. Moreover, the

Claimants point out that the Respondent has agreed to dozens of other BIT
texts in a number of languages, including the BIT concluded between the
Government of the Kingdom of Norway and the Government of the Russian
Federation, that definitely late kapitalovlozhenie as “i ” and

vlozhit as “to invest”.

Finally, the Clai refute the Respondents allegation that the i

relied upon by the Claimants are illegal. The Claimants submit that the ruling
of the Moscow City Court was illegitimate and forms part of the very
expropriatory plained of in this Arbitration. M , the
Claimants maintain that the Moscow City Court’s decision could not have
rendered BI’s construction activities illegal, because by the time it took effect
in August 2002, the construction project had been complete for over nine

months.

Claimants are investors within the meaning of the Treaty

The Claimants defend their jus standi and argue that they should not be
disqualified from relying upon the Treaty merely on the grounds that some of
their investments are owned indirectly through BI. They contend that this
would contradict the universal recognition of shareholders’ standing to
maintain claims for harm to their investments, regardless of whether such
assets are owned directly or through the company through which they conduct

investment activity.

According to the Claimants, nearly every investment arbitration tribunal that
has so far addressed the issue has confirmed the standing of shareholders to
maintain investment claims not only for damage to their shares, but for all
damage sustained by the company which they own. In support of this

contention, the Claimants rely upon the decisions of a number of international

arbitration tribunals, such as CMS v Argentina’, AMT v Zaire’, Genin v
Estonia’, Goetz v Burundi’, Fedax N.V. v Venezuela® and Enron v Argentina’.

82. The Claimants also refute the Respondent’s contention that the fact that the
Treaty offers protection for investments held indirectly through third-country
companies was intended to exclude from coverage indirect investments made
through Belgian entities such as BI. The Claimants submit that the provision in
question was clearly designed to remove all doubt that Belgian or Russian
investors would enjoy standing under the Treaty despite the presence in the
chain of ownership of an entity whose home State was not a signatory thereto.
According to the Claimants, the jus standi of qualifying investors who own
their investment through a Belgian or Russian company was taken for granted,
and is a lesser authorisation included within the special mention contained in
the second paragraph of Article 1.2, The Claimants argue that it would be
nonsensical and in breach of the objects of the Treaty for them to be refused
protection under the Treaty on the sole ground that their investment vehicle
was a Belgian company rather than a company incorporated in a third state.

4.2.4 All claims presented are subject to Treaty arbitration

83. Contrary to the Respondent’s contention, the Claimants maintain that
compulsory arbitral jurisdiction under Article 10 extends to all claims arising
out of Article 5 of the Treaty. The Claimants contend that it stands to reason
that by specifically naming “the amount or mode of compensation to be paid”
after expropriation, the Contracting Parties understood that the issue of whether

expropriation has occurred was also to be arbitrable. The Claimants maintain

that the “fact” of expropriation cannot be separated from the “amount and
mode of compensation”. A contrary interpretation would, according to the
Claimants, render Article 10 meaningless, since the host State would need only

assert that no expropriation had occurred to avoid arbitration altogether.

The Claimants also rely upon the Explanatory Statement as evidence that both
Belgium and the Respondent understood Article 10 to extend to all disputes
related to expropriation. The Claimants further point out that at the time the
Treaty was negotiated, there were no arbitrazh courts in the Soviet Union and,
as a result, the Respondent could not be correct in its contention that the parties
intended disputes concerning the fact of expropriation to be submitted to such
“Russian arbitrazh courts”. Finally, the Claimants submit that the Respondent
has actually admitted the fact of its expropriatory acts.

The Claimants admit that Article 10 of the Treaty permits arbitration only of
claims relating to expropriation and, therefore, seeks to rely upon the MFN
clause contained in Article 2 of the Treaty. In their Request for Arbitration, the
Claimants sought to invoke the arbitration clause contained in the BIT
concluded between the Government of the Kingdom of Norway and the
Government of the Russian Federation on 4 October 1995 (the “Norway BIT”).
During the course of the oral hearing, however, the Respondent claimed that
the scope of the arbitration clause in the Norway BIT was limited to the
calculation of damages for breaches of the Treaty as already established by
Russian courts. The Claimants rejected this argument.

Nonetheless, in their post-hearing submission of 2 November 2005, the
Claimants further sought to invoke Article 8 of the Denmark — Russian
Federation BIT of 4 November 1993 (the “Denmark Treaty”) in order to avoid
any uncertainty in relation to the Norway Treaty. Under Article 8 of the
Denmark Treaty, any dispute “in connection with an investment” may be
bmitted to arbitration. Accordingly, the Claii submit that a Danish

investor would be entitled to submit to SCC arbitration, not only disputes
related to expropriation of its investments, but also any claim arising out of the
Russian Federation’s violations of other treaty standards, including fair and
equitable treatment, full protection and security, and respect for undertakings.
The Claimants argue that this improved access to international arbitration
constitutes more favourable treatment, since “the provisions for independent
international arbitration of disputes between investors and host states” is

perhaps “the most crucial element” of BIT protection.

The Claimants also refute the Respondent’s contention that by operation of the
Treaty’s Protocol, the most-favoured nation clause applies only to rights
granted to nationals of third-party States that (i) were members of the OECD in
1989, and (ii) had already concluded and ratified BITs with the Soviet Union
by that date. The Claimants state that such an interpretation of the Protocol is
in direct conflict with its plain meaning. The Protocol was intended to limit the
effect of the MFN clause to rights granted to citizens of States that were OECD
members at the time the Treaty was signed, but there was no intention to
require that such States had entered into BITs with the Respondent. The
Claimants point out that no tribunal has ever refused to apply the provisions of
a third-party investment treaty by operation of an MFN clause on the grounds
that the treaty to be applied post-dated the treaty directly applicable.

The Claimants deny any contention that the Treaty’s MFN clause may not
extend to the procedural benefits of investment treaties. The Claimants
maintain that the Treaty’s MFN clause is “maximally broad” embracing “all
areas covered by the present Treaty.” It is said to be uncontroversial that
dispute resolution is an area covered by the Treaty, The Claimants further
contend that the weight of legal opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of
extending MFN treatment to BIT dispute resolution provisions, In particular,

the Claimants rely upon the decisions in Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain'°,

Siemens v Argentina’! and Gas Natural v Argentina’.

89. Finally, the Claimants submit that the arbitration clause in the Contract
between BI and the Supreme Court is not relevant to this Tribunal’s
consideration of the claims raised by the Claimants against the Respondent.
The Claimants maintain that many arbitral tribunals, applying the provisions of
BITs, have affirmed the principle that exclusive jurisdiction clauses in
contracts cannot affect an investor’s right to invoke the dispute resolution
provisions of an applicable investment treaty. In support of this contention, the
Claimants rely upon, inter alia, Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and
Compagnie Générale des Eaux v Argentina’, On this basis, the Claimants state
that BI’s rights under the Contract cannot affect the Claimants’ right to submit
Treaty disputes to this Tribunal under Article 10 of the Treaty.

4.2.5 The Claimants’ action does not constitute a fraud on BI

90. The Clai deny the Respondent’s allegation that the Claii action
before the Tribunal is fraudulent under Belgian law and International Public
Order. The Claimants further deny that they are participating in these
proceedings in the name of BI. The Claimants maintain that they are asserting
their own rights as shareholders to bring a claim under the Treaty. The
Claimants’ promise to satisfy the claims of BI’s creditors out of any recovery
from the Russian Federation is said to merely constitute an expression of their
own interest in re-establishing their business in its former condition by freeing

BI from bankruptcy,

The Claimants further contend that the Respondent’s submissions in this regard
are irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction in this case. All submissions
regarding any potential breach of Belgian law are irrelevant, according to the
Claimants, since the law applicable to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal consists
of the terms of the Treaty and any applicable principles of international law.
The Claimants refute that the alleged breach of Belgian bankruptcy law
constitutes a breach of international public policy.

Finally, the Claimants point to the fact that the bankruptcy receiver of BI has
refused to initiate proceedings under the Treaty. As a result, BI is, for all
practical purposes, precluded from appearing as a claimant in the proceedings.
The Claimants allege that this serves to confirm the rationale for recognising
the jus standi of the Claimants. It is contended that if only the immediate
investment vehicle, and not its owners, can maintain a claim under an
investment treaty, then a host State need only force the company into
bankruptcy in order to escape liability altogether. The Claimants argue that
such a situation creates perverse incentives for host States, is incompatible with
the investment protection goals of the Treaty and breaches the rule of
international law that “no one can be allowed take advantage of his own

wrong” — nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria.

Reasons for the decision

Law applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

The first issue which the Tribunal is called to address concerns the relevant law
applicable to the determination of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Respondent
contends that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal must be considered in light of the
Treaty, Russian law and generally accepted norms and principles of
international law. The Respondent also maintains that it is only international

treaties which have been entered into by the Russian Federation which should

be considered by the Tribunal. In particular, the Respondent submits that the
ICSID Convention and all arbitration decisions based thereon are irrelevant to
the question of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction since the Russian Federation is not a

party to the ICSID Convention.

The Claimant, on the other hand, argues that the terms of the Treaty and
international law are the only sources of law applicable to determining the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Claimant maintains that Russian law has no
role to play in this regard. Moreover, the Claimant argues that international
arbitration law and practice, while not strictly binding on this Tribunal,
nonetheless, constitutes a persuasive source of law which the Tribunal is

entitled to have regard to in reaching its decision on jurisdiction.

The Tribunal finds that the principal source of law applicable to the question of
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must be provisions of the Treaty. Insofar as the
terms of the Treaty are unclear or require interpretation or supplementation, the
Vienna Convention requires the Tribunal to consider “the relevant rules of

international law applicable in relations between the parties”"*.

The Vienna Convention provides no role for the domestic law of contracting
states in the interpretation of international treaties. Therefore, in the instant
case, it is clear that Russian national law is of no relevance in this regard.
While Russian law may be relevant in establishing certain factual
circumstances involved in the merits of the case, it has no role to play in

determining the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s contention that the Russian Federation
is not bound by international treaties to which it is not a party, nor by judicial
and arbitration practice resulting from the application of such treaties. In
particular, the Tribunal is well aware that the Russian Federation is not a party

‘Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31(3)(c).

to the ICSID Convention. Nonetheless, the Tribunal does not believe that any
of these matters precludes the Tribunal from having regard to intemational
investment case law as a persuasive source of law. While such case law and
practice is in no way binding upon the Tribunal or the parties, the Tribunal
must, nonetheless, be entitled to consider and take into account the conclusions
of other arbitral tribunals who have addressed similar issues with respect to
similar treaties and identically worded provisions. Moreover, jurisprudence and
doctrine emanating from the decisions of international tribunals and the works
of learned authors is frequently referred to as a source of international law for

the purpose of interpreting treaties under the Vienna Convention.

5.2 Compliance with the pre-arbitration procedures

98. Article 10.1 contains the pre-arbitration procedures necessary to be taken by an
investor prior to invoking arbitration under the Treaty. Specifically, Article
10.1 requires “a written notice, accompanied by a detailed memorandum, to be
submitted by the investor to the Contracting Party involved in the dispute.”

99. The purpose of such pre-arbitration procedure requirements in BITs has been
considered by a number of arbitral tribunals in cases such as Salini v
Morocco", Petrobart v Krygystan’® and Lauder v Czech Republic'’. From
these decisions, it is clear that arbitral tribunals, while duly considering that
purpose, have chosen to take a flexible and pragmatic approach to such
requirements. The Tribunal sees the merit in this approach and believes that a
formalistic interpretation of Article 10.1 would not serve to protect the

legitimate interests of either party in the instant case.

33(75)

The purpose of the notification requirement in Article 10.1 is to provide the
parties with an opportunity to enter into good-faith negotiations before
initiating arbitration. As in Salini y Morocco, the Tribunal in this case must be
satisfied that the necessary and appropriate steps were actually taken to contact
the relevant authorities of the Respondent with a view to reaching a settlement
and thereby putting an end to their dispute. The notices submitted must be
sufficient to allow the Respondent to become aware of the dispute and to take
steps towards negotiations and possible settlement of the dispute if it so wishes.

With the three letters to the Presidential Administration, the Government and
the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, all reasonable steps in contacting
the relevant authorities of the Respondent were taken with a view to reaching a
settlement and thereby putting an end to their dispute. Moreover, the three
letters have clearly allowed the Respondent to become aware of the dispute and
to take steps towards the resolution of the dispute. Indeed, subsequent to the
delivery of the first two letters, the Respondent entered into negotiations in
relation to the dispute culminating in the Supplemental Agreement of 24
December 2001 and the payment by the Respondent of US $ 341,487 in partial
settlement of the dispute. The Tribunal, accordingly, rejects the Respondent’s
contention that, in order to be duly served, the notices must be submitted
directly through the diplomatic channel to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Importantly, the Tribunal also finds that the dispute as described in detail in the
letters and the panying da submitted by the Clai

corresponds in all material aspects to the dispute currently before the Tribunal.
Consequently, while the Tribunal recognises that the letters were formally sent

 

by BI and signed by the Claimants in their capacity as representatives of BI,
the Tribunal does not believe that this factor undermines the validity of the
letters as notices of the dispute at hand. The purpose of Article 10.1 has been
fulfilled. The Respondent has been provided with detailed notice of the
circumstances surrounding the dispute at hand and has thus had ample

opportunity to seek an amicable settlement. It would, therefore, serve no
purpose for the Tribunal to dismiss this claim and require the Claimants as
private persons, rather than in their capacity as representatives of BI, to

resubmit notice of the dispute to the Respondent.

Tn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the three letters submitted satisfy the
requirements of Article 10.1 of the Treaty and that the Claimants have thereby
complied with the pre-arbitration procedures required under the Treaty.

The Tribunal does not, accordingly, accept the Respondent’s contention that
the dispute referred to therein is materially different from the present dispute

between the Claimants and the Respondent.

Are the Claimants investors within the meaning of the Treaty?

The Respondents have argued that the Claimants cannot be considered as
“Gnvestors” within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the Treaty, since the Claimants
as physical persons did not implement any capital investments in the territory
of the Russian Federation. The Tribunal is of the view that this argument does
not affect the question of whether or not the Claimants come within the
definition of “investors” under Article 1.1 of the Treaty. The argument
presented by the Respondent goes rather to the issue of whether or not the
Claimants have made “investments” within the scope of Article 1.2 of the

Treaty.

The definition of “investors” under Article 1.1 of the Treaty is quite
straightforward and includes, inter alia, any natural person who is recognised
as a citizen of the Soviet Union, Belgium or Luxembourg and is entitled to
make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance
with its country’s laws. It is uncontested that both of the Claimants are natural

persons and citizens of Belgium. The Tribunal has, consequently, no difficulty

in finding that the Claimants are investors within the meaning of Article 1.1 of
the Treaty.

Have the Claimants carried out investments within the meaning of the
Treaty?

The more complex question is whether or not the Claimants have carried out

“investments” within the meaning of the Treaty.

The meaning of the terms kapitalovlozhenie and viozhit

The Tribunal will firstly deal with the Respondent’s contention that the terms
kapitalovlozhenie and vlozhit in Article 1.2 of the Russian language version of
the Treaty restrict qualifying investments to capital investments capable of
contribution to the charter capital of a joint venture, The Tribunal believes that
such an interpretation of Article 1.2 cannot be supported.

Firstly, the Tribunal finds ample evidence amongst Russian-English legal and
dictionaries for lating the term kapitalovlozhenie as

“investment” and the term vlozhit as “to invest”. Secondly, it is possible to
point to a large number of BIT;s concluded by the Respondent where Russian
and English are the authentic languages of the Treaty and where the term
kapitalovlozhenie is translated as “investment” and viozhit is translated as “to
invest”.'* It is thus clear that, while those terms may sometimes be used in the
Russian language in the more limited sense of “contributions to the charter
capital of a joint venture”, they are in fact also frequently used in a broader

sense corresponding exactly to the English terms “investment” and “invest”.

Furthermore, regard must be had to the French version of the Treaty which, as
set out in the Protocol, is equally as authoritative as the Russian version. The
French text uses the words investissement and investir. With respect to these
French terms, there can be no doubt but that their ordinary meaning is identical
to that of the English words “investment” and “to invest”. Therefore, and for
the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s objections

on this point must fail.

The lawfulness of the Claimants’ investments

The Respondent has further contended that the investments relied upon by the
Claimants were illegal and, as a result, do not satisfy the requirements of
compliance with the laws of the Russian Federation contained in Article 1.2 of
the Treaty. The Tribunal is of the view that the lawfulness of the investments
relied upon by the Claimants is a not an issue affecting the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal, but rather a substantive issue pertaining to the merits of the case. It
would, therefore, be inappropriate for the Tribunal to consider this issue at this
stage in the proceedings.

The term “investments” under Article 1,2 of the Treaty

Article 1.2 of the Treaty contains a broad definition of the term “investment”.
For the purpose of the Treaty, an investment may comprise any kind of asset
invested in the territory of a Contracting Party. Article 1.2 also provides a non-
exhaustive list of the kind of assets which will constitute investments under the
Treaty. These include property, financial credits as well as shares, rights of
claim relating to performance having an economic value and intellectual
property rights. The second paragraph of Article 1.2 provides that the term
“investment” also means indirect investments made by investors of one of the
Contracting Parties in the territory of the other Contracting Party by the
intermediary of an investor of a third state.

Two further important qualifications are set out in Article 1.2. In order to
qualify as an investment under the Treaty, the assets in question must be
invested by qualifying investors from of a Contracting Party. Furthermore, the
investments must be made in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Both
these criteria must be fulfilled in order for the asset in question to constitute a

qualifying investment under the Treaty.

The particular investments relied upon by the Claimants

The Claimants seek to rely upon the following assets as “investments” for the

purposes of Article 1.2 of the Treaty:

(a) the Claimants’ shares in BI;

(b) the Contract;

(c) the Claimants’ property rights in the Buildings; and
(d) the Agreed Debt.

The Tribunal will deal first with the basic question of whether these alleged
investments qualify as “assets” protected under the Treaty.

There can be no doubt but that shares are one of the categories of property
protected by the Treaty. This is expressly stated in Article 1.2.2.

As regards the Contract, the Tribunal is of the view that such contract does
constitute an “asset” within the meaning of Article 1.2 of the Treaty. In
particular, the Contract may be considered as bestowing rights relating to “any
performance having an economic value” in accordance with Article 1.2.3. The

Tribunal notes that this principle appears to have been generally accepted in a

21 APR 2046 11:16 MANNHEIMER SWARTL ANG +46 8 SOS76501 SID 48/84

+46 8 50576501

38(75)

 

number of previous investment arbitration disputes, such as Salini v Morocco’’,
where construction contracts were held to constitute protected assets for the

purposes of investment treaties.

118. With respect to the property rights in the Buildings, such rights must also be
held to constitute “assets” under the Treaty. The right relied upon by the
Claimants in this regard is the right pursuant to Russian law to retain ownership
of a construction site until payment for construction services has been rendered
in full. Such right clearly entails an economic value and therefore falls within
the scope of Article 1.2.3.

119, Finally, the Agreed Debt in effect constitutes credit extended to the Russian
Federation and consequently qualifies as an “asset” under Article 1.2.2 of the
Treaty.

120. Hence, the Tribunal finds that all the assets relied upon by the Claimants fall

within the categories of property protected by the Treaty. However, as noted
above, this fact alone does not warrant the conclusion that these assets qualify
as “investments” under the Treaty. With regard to each of the assets, the
additional question must be asked as to whether or not the further qualifications

set out in Article 1.2 are met.

121. In this regard, and turning first to the Claimants’ shares in BI, the Tribunal
finds that such assets cannot constitute a qualifying investment within the
terms of Article 1.2 of the Treaty. BI is a company incorporated and
established under the laws of Belgium. The Claimants’ shareholding in B] is,
therefore, an investment in a Belgian company and, as such, cannot be
considered an investment in the territory of the Russian Federation. The
reference to “shares and other forms of participation in companies and
enterprises” contained in Article 1.2.2 must reasonably be construed as

referring to companies and enterprises incorporated under the laws of the State
in which the investment is alleged to have been made.

This difficulty does not arise with regard to the Contract, the property rights in
the Buildings and the Agreed Debt. These assets undoubtedly constitute
investments made in the territory of the Russian Federation. However, each of
these investments was made by BI, which is a separate legal entity from the
Claimants. It is BI, and not the Claimants, who is a party to the Contract,
enjoys the right of retention in the Buildings and is the party entitled to
payment under the Agreed Debt.

The Claimants, insofar as the Tribunal understands their position, do not deny

this. However, the Claimants argue that the Treaty does not only protect direct
investments but also indirect investments and that the assets relied upon in this
arbitration qualify as indirect investments within the scope of the Treaty.

The protection of indirect investments under the Treaty

In light of the above, the Tribunal now tums to consider the question of
whether, or to what extent, the Treaty offers protection to indirect investments.
In particular, it must be considered whether the investments made by BI, as
discussed above, can be relied upon by the Claimants as qualifying indirect
investments within the scope of Article 1.2.

It should be kept in mind that this discussion is of relevance only with respect
to the Contract, the Claimants’ property rights in the Buildings and the Agreed
Debt. The question of indirect investments does not apply to the shares, since
the Tribunal has already found that such shares do not qualify as investments
made in the territory of the Russian Federation and are consequently excluded

from protection under the Treaty.

126, The Claimants have produced a large number of authorities on the basis of
which they proclaim “universal ition of shareholders’ ding to

maintain claims for harm to their investments, regardless of whether such

 

assets are owned directly or through the company through which they conduct

their investment activity.”

127. The cases relied upon by the Claimants may, however, be distinguished from
the instant case in a number of fundamental respects. In the majority of the
cases cited by the Claimants, the investors in question invested in shares in
companies incorporated in the host State. These locally incorporated
companies then went on to make the particular investments allegedly interfered
with by the respondent State. The Tribunal is of the view that these cases are
not in fact clear examples of indirect investments. In each case, the Claimants
were in a position to point to their shareholding in the locally incorporated
companies as constituting direct investments under the terms of the relevant
BIT. The principal issue discussed in each case was to what extent the
shareholders were entitled to claim damages for loss to the company as
opposed to loss to the mere value of their shares.

128. The Claimants refer, infer alia, to Enron v Argentina’® and CMS y Argentina",
AMT v Zaire”, CME v Czech Republic”®, Gas Natural v Argentina” and
Maffezini v Spain**. All of these cases concemed investments made via locally
incorporated companies. The arbitral tribunal in each case was able to uphold
its jurisdiction on the grounds that the claimants’ shareholding in the locally
incorporated companies constituted a direct investment under the terms of the

relevant BIT.

129. A further factor which distinguishes the above cases from the instant case is
that the incorporated companies did not qualify as foreign investors in the
above cases and hence were not entitled to bring an action under the relevant
BITs. The shareholders’ investment was not, in other words, protected by the
companies’ right to rely upon the BIT. In the instant case, on the other hand, BI
is fully entitled to bring an action under the Treaty. The investments are,
accordingly, already protected by BI’s right to rely upon the terms of the
Treaty.

130. The Claimants further rely upon the decision in Fedax N.V. v Venezuela”®. This
case concerned six promissory notes which had been issued by the Republic of
Venezuela in acknowledgment of the debt owed by it to a Venezuelan
company under a contract for the provision of services. The Venezuelan
company subsequently assigned the promissory notes by way of endorsement
to the Dutch company Fedax N.V. (“Fedax”). When Fedax sought protection
with respect to the promissory notes under the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT, the
Respondent objected to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal on the grounds
that Fedax’s holding of the promissory notes was not a direct foreign

investment and hence did not qualify as an “investment” within the terms of

the BIT.
131. AS pointed out by the Claimants, the arbitral tribunal, in upholding its
aarisdi identified a “broad ap h”2 to the definition of i

 

under international investment agreements and further held that the term
“investment” in the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT was to be given a broad reach
in light of the negotiating history of the ICSID Convention.”* However, the
tribunal went on to carefully distinguish between the underlying transaction
involving the Respondent and the V 1 pany and “the sut

endorsement of the promissory notes to foreign holders”.”” The tribunal
accepted that “promissory notes of this kind have a legal standing of their own,
separate and independent from the underlying transaction.”*° The tribunal also
pointed out that the notes were fully negotiable and denominated in U.S.
dollars, as a result of which the Respondent must have foreseen “the possibility
that the promissory notes would be transferred and endorsed to subsequent
holders”.?! In the case of such endorsement, the tribunal stated that “although
the identity of the investor will change with every endorsement, the investment
itself will remain constant, while the issuer will enjoy a continuous credit
benefit until the time the notes become due.” The tribunal concluded that
“[t]o the extent this credit is provided by a foreign holder of the notes, it
constitutes a foreign investment which in this case is encompassed by the terms

of the Convention and the Agreement.”

132. By analysing the nature of the promissory notes in this fashion, the tribunal
effectively identified the credit extended by Fedax to the Respondent, as
evidenced by the notes, as a direct investment under the terms of the Treaty. By
divorcing the promissory notes from the underlying transaction, the tribunal
removed the indirect element in the investment. It was irrelevant that the
underlying ion had been luded b the Respondent and the

Venezuelan company. It was the credit extended under the promissory notes

 

which constituted the investment and it was the Claimant who directly made
this investment once the notes had been assigned. Ultimately, therefore, the
decision of the arbitral tribunal in the Fedax case was not based on an

p of indirect i as qualifying i Clai in the
instant case may rely upon the investments made by BI.

133. Finally, the Claimants point to the decision of the arbitral tribunal in Genin v
Estonia*. The three claimants in this case consisted of Alex Genin, a citizen of
the United States, an Estonian company called A.S. Baltoil, and a US
Corporation called Eastern Credit Limited Inc. (“Eastern Credit”). All three
claimants held interests in the Estonian Innovation Bank (“EIB”), a financial
institution incorporated under the laws of Estonia, and sought protection for
their interests in EIB under the Estonia - USA BIT. A.S. Baltoil and Eastern
Credit were direct shareholders in EIB, whereas Mr. Genin’s interest arose by
virtue of his 100 % ownership of Eastern Credit. The claimants’ respective
interests were accepted by the tribunal as qualifying investments under the
BIT.

134. While the Genin case did involve the indirect shareholding of Mr. Genin, there
are nonetheless certain specific matters which distinguish the decision from the
case at hand. The tribunal in the Genin case was not presented with any
objection to Mr. Genin’s indirect shareholding constituting a qualifying
investment and hence the question was not considered or discussed in the
decision. As noted in the foregoing, while international investment case law is
not binding on the Tribunal or the parties, the Tribunal is nonetheless entitled
to consider and take into account the conclusions of other arbitral tribunals who
have addressed similar issues with respect to similar treaties and identically
worded provisions, However, when, as in the Genin case, an arbitral award
provides no reasons for the course of action chosen by the tribunal, such an
award has very little relevance as a persuasive source of law. The relevance of
the Genin case is further diminished by the fact that the definition of
“jnvestment” in the Estonia — USA BIT differs considerably from the
definition in the Treaty, in that the definition in the Estonia— USA BIT
expressly encompasses “shares of stock or other interests in a company” which

are “owned or controlled, directly or indirectly” by investors.*®

In conclusion, the Claimants have been unable to produce any authority which
is directly applicable to the issue at hand in the present case. Indeed, it would
seem that this is the first case in which the sole claimants are foreign
shareholders in a foreign incorporated company seeking to rely upon the terms
of a BIT without having made any direct investment on their own part. In the
absence of any authority on the point, the Tribunal believes that there can be no
presumption that the wording of Article 1.2 encompasses the kind of indirect

investment relied upon in the instant case.

The Tribunal must, accordingly, turn to the text of the Treaty to determine
whether the Contracting Parties intended the kind of indirect investment arising
in the instant case to be encompassed by the definition of “investment” in
Article 1.2. In accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties (the “Vienna Convention”), the Treaty is to be interpreted “in
good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of
the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose”.

The ordinary meaning of Article 1.2 is, however, difficult to ascertain. The first
sentence provides that the investment relied upon may be “any kind of asset”
which is invested by qualifying investors of one Contracting Party “in the
territory of the other Contracting Party”. The plain meaning of the provision
requires that the investment in question be made by the investor seeking
protection under the Treaty and that such investment be made in the territory of
the other Contracting Party. This provision makes no reference to indirect
investments and it is noteworthy that this definition is not particularly broad.
Definitions in certain other BITs expressly provide for protection of
investments “owned or controlled directly or indirectly” by the party concerned
(see e.g. Argentina—United States BIT). Such is not the case under the present
Treaty. Nonetheless, the wording of the Treaty does not exclude and therefore
leaves open the possibility that an investment made indirectly by the investor in

the territory of the other Contracting Party is encompassed by the terms of
Article 1.2.

The only express reference to indirect investments is contained in the second
paragraph of Article 1.2. Here it is provided that “[t]he term “investment” also
means indirect investments made by investors of one of the Contracting Parties
in the territory of the other Contracting Party by the intermediary of an investor
of a third state.” Accordingly, if BI had been incorporated in a third state and
made the alleged investments in the Russian territory, the Claimants would
have been entitled to invoke the terms of the Treaty in reliance upon such
investments. Since this is not the case, however, the provision cannot be

applied in the instant case.

The parties have, nonetheless, suggested diametrically opposed conclusions
which may be drawn from the express reference to this form of indirect
investment. The Claimants argue that lack of any reference to indirect
investments through a Belgian or Russian company shows that the jus standi of
investors who owned their investment through a Belgian or Russian company
was taken for granted. The Respondent, on the other hand, has argued that the
express reference to indirect investments in the second paragraph of Article 1.2
clearly shows that this was the only form of indirect investment which the
Contracting Parties intended to be protected under the Treaty. Had they
intended to include indirect investments made by an intermediary of the
investor’s state, then this would have been expressly provided for in the second

paragraph.

In the view of the Tribunal, the specific reference in the second paragraph of
Article 1.2 to indirect investments via third state intermediaries may be
understood in light of the fact that such investments might otherwise have been
entirely unprotected in those cases where no investment protection treaty
existed between the third country and the Soviet Union. It may also be noted

+46 8 50576501

46(75)

that such cases were more frequent in 1989 when the Treaty was concluded

than today.

141. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that the decision of the International Court of
Justice in the Barcelona Traction case had some influence on the drafting of
the Treaty on this point. This case involved a claim brought against Spain by
Belgium on behalf of the Belgian majority shareholders in a Canadian
company on the basis of alleged unlawful measures taken against the company.
Belgium’s claim was dismissed on the grounds that “where it is a question of
an unlawful act committed against a company representing foreign capital, the
general rule of international law authorises the national State of the company
alone to make a claim.’ This Tribunal is aware that a strong argument can be
made that Barcelona Traction no longer reflects the current state of
international law. But in 1989 the issue was less clear and in light of Belgium’s
experience, it is perhaps not unreasonable to conclude that the inclusion of the
second paragraph of Article 1.2 in the Treaty was intended to avoid a similar
result arising with respect to investments between the Contracting Parties.

142. The question, nonetheless, remains as to whether any conclusions may be
drawn from the fact that the Contracting Parties, when specifically including
indirect investments via third state intermediaries, did not expressly include
indirect investments via companies incorporated in the investors’ home states.
The Tribunal does not find any reason to assume that the Contracting Parties
took for granted that such investments were covered by the terms of the first
paragraph of Article 1.2. Since, as discussed above, there are specific reasons
for including in the Treaty the reference to indirect investments via third
country intermediaries, that reference cannot be construed as simply being an
expression of a general principle that all indirect investments are protected by
the Treaty.

143. What may be assumed, however, on the basis of the ordinary meaning of the
wording of Articles 1.1 and 1.2, is that the Contracting Parties considered
investments via companies incorporated in the investors’ home states to be
protected by the right of such companies to bring a claim under the terms of the
Treaty. It is clear that a Belgian or Russian company itself, in such
circumstances, is a qualifying investor under Article 1.1 and may, therefore,
rely on the provisions of the Treaty. In other words, by extending the coverage
of the Treaty to investments made through third country vehicles the
Contracting Parties provided protection to investments which would otherwise
typically have been unprotected. To extend the coverage of the Treaty to the
indirect investments of shareholders of Belgian or Russian companies, on the
other hand, would have meant providing additional protection to investments
which were already fully protected under the Treaty. In the view of the
Tribunal, it is more reasonable to assume that the Contracting Parties saw no
need to provide such additional protection to the indirect investments of the
shareholders of Belgian or Russian companies, particularly in view of the

absence of any express provision to this effect in the text of the Treaty.

144, The Vienna Convention also requires that reference be made to the object and
purpose of the Treaty. The Preamble to the Treaty makes specific reference to
the Contracting Parties’ desire “to create favourable conditions for investments
by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting
Party” and to “the positive effect that the present Treaty can have on fostering
business contacts and strengthening trust in the area of investments.” The
Claimants have argued that this wording should be used in support of a broad
and expansive interpretation of Article 1.2. The Tribunal believes, however,
that the object of promoting investments as set out in the Preamble does not
provide any guidance on whether or not the type of indirect investments relied
upon by the Claimants in the instant case is protected by the Treaty. The
intention of both Contracting Parties when signing the Treaty may well have

been to promote investment between the two countries, but such aim can be
achieved by different means and in varying degrees. The wording of the
Preamble cannot reasonably be interpreted as a declaration by the Contracting
Parties that all forms of investment — direct or indirect — are to be protected
under the Treaty.

The Tribunal also finds it of relevance to consider the practice of the
Contracting States with respect to indirect investments as evidenced by the
terms of other BITs entered into by the Soviet Union, Belgium or Luxembourg.
Firstly, it may be noted that a large number of the BITs concluded by Belgium
and Luxembourg provide express protection for indirect investments. These
include the BITs concluded with Albania, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi,
Bolivia, Czech Republic, Egypt and Paraguay. For example, Article 1.2 of the
Belgium/Luxembourg — Paraguay BIT contains the following definition of
“investments”:

“Le terme "<investissements>" désigne tout élément d'actif quelconque et tout apport direct ou
indirect en numéraire, en nature ou en services, investi ou réinvesti dans tout secteur d'activité

économique, quel qu'il soit.”

On the other hand, only one BIT signed by the Russian Federation provides
express protection for indirect investments. Section 1(c) of the USA — Russian
Federation BIT defines investment as “any kind of investment, in the territory
of one Party owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Party”.
It may be noted, however, that this BIT has not been ratified by the Russian
Federation. Moreover, the large majority of the remaining BITs concluded by
the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation contain no express reference to

indirect investments.

No firm conclusions may be drawn from the contrasting practice of the
Contracting Parties in this regard. Nonetheless, such contrasting approaches do

render it unlikely that, in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary, both
Contracting Parties intended that the Treaty would encompass the kind of
indirect investments relied upon the Claimants. It would seem likely that if the
Contracting Parties had so intended, they would have expressly provided.
protection for such indirect investments in the terms of the Treaty, as in the
case of the other relevant BITs concluded by Belgium and Luxembourg.

Finally, the Tribunal wishes to address the Claimant’s argument that regard
must be had to the economic reality behind the investments made by BI. The
Claimants contend that the “real” investment of capital was made by the
Claimants. The mere fact that such investment may have been made through
the vehicle of BI should not, according to the Claimants, preclude protection
under the Treaty. The Tribunal acknowledges this economic reality described
by the Claimants. Nonetheless, such policy considerations cannot extend the
protection offered by the Treaty beyond the terms agreed between the
Contracting Parties.

Moreover, the Treaty does in fact provide protection for the “real” investment
highlighted by the Claimants insofar as BI, as a qualifying investor, would be
fully entitled to rely upon the investments it made in the Russian Federation.
The argument made by the Claimants on this point would have been more
convincing if the vehicle through which the investments were made had been
barred from claiming protection under the Treaty. However, this is not the
case. The reason why the Claimants, and not BI, are bringing a claim under the
Treaty is that the Claimants no longer control BI since that company has been
declared bankrupt. The Tribunal does not believe that the purpose of the Treaty
is to help shareholders overcome this kind of obstacle.

In conclusion, based on a reasonable interpretation of the text of the Treaty in
its context and in light of its object and purpose and the practice of the
Contracting Parties, the Tribunal cannot find that the Contracting Parties

intended that the indirect investments relied upon by the Claimants would be
encompassed by the definition of “investment” under Article 1.2. The
Claimants have accordingly failed to show that they have made qualifying

investments within the meaning of the Treaty.

Scope of arbitration under the Treaty

Scope of Article 10

The Tribunal now tums to deal with the Respondent’s contention that the
claims made by the Claimants cannot be subject to arbitration under the Treaty.
Once again, the starting point for the Tribunal’s analysis of this issue must be
the actual terms of the Treaty. The scope of the arbitration clause in Article
10.1 is expressly stated to extend to any dispute between one Contracting Party
and an investor of another Contracting Party concerning the amount or mode of
compensation to be paid under Article 5 of the Treaty.** In the original French

version of the Treaty, Article 10,1 provides as follows:

“Tout différend entre l’une des Parties contractantes et un investisscur de |’autre Partie
contractante, relative au montant ou au mode de paiement des indemnités dues en vertu de

Varticle 5...”

By virtue of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the Tribunal is, once again,
obliged to interpret Article 10.1 in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
given to the terms thereof in their context and in light of the object and purpose
of the Treaty. The Tribunal is of the view that the ordinary meaning of Article
10.1 is quite clear. Only disputes concerning the amount or mode of
compensation (“au montant ou au mode de paiement des indemnités”) to be
paid under Article 5 may be subjected to arbitration. The wording expressly
limits the type of dispute, which may be subjected to arbitration under the

Treaty, to a dispute concerning the amount or mode of compensation to be paid
in the event of an expropriatory act occurring under the terms of Article 5.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the ordinary meaning of the provision excludes
from the scope of the arbitration clause: (i) disputes concerning any of the
provisions of the Treaty other than Article 5, and (ii) disputes concerning
whether or not an act of expropriation actually occurred under Article 5. From
the ordinary meaning of Article 10.1, it can only be assumed that the
Contracting Parties intended that a dispute concerning whether or not an act of
expropriation actually occurred was to be submitted to dispute resolution
procedures provided for under the applicable contract or alternatively to the
domestic courts of the Contracting Party in which the investment is made. It is
only a dispute which arises regarding the amount or mode of compensation to
be paid subsequent to an act of expropriation already having been established,
either by acknowledgment of the responsible Contracting Party or by a court or
arbitral tribunal, which may be subject to arbitration under the Treaty.

From the point of view of the Respondent, it has been alleged that this
restriction of the arbitration clause contained in Article 10 was a strict point of
principle for the Soviet Union at the time of the signing of the Treaty. The
Respondent submits that the Soviet Union proceeded on the basis that the
question of the occurrence of an act of expropriation must in every particular
case be decided by the national courts of the state in whose territory the

expropriation was alleged to have taken place.

Support for this contention may be found by considering the other BITs
concluded by the Soviet Union. In the majority of the early BITs concluded by
the Soviet Union in 1989 and 1990, the arbitration clause is limited to disputes

concerning the amount or method of compensation to be paid on foot of an

expropriatory act.”? For instance, the arbitration provision in Article 8 of the
United Kingdom — Soviet Union BIT, signed on 6 April 1989, refers to any
legal dispute “concerning the amount or payment of compensation under
Articles 4 or 5 of this Agreement.” While somewhat broader dispute resolution
provisions, relating to the “consequences” of measures taken by the host states,
were included in the BITs concluded with France and Canada, the majority of
these early BITs illustrate an identifiable practice on the part of the Soviet
Union, which corresponds with the policy considerations alleged by the
Respondent to lie behind the restrictive wording of Article 10 of the Treaty.
Moreover, it is interesting to note that a definite change of policy can be
observed in the BITs concluded by the Russian Federation in the late 1990s
subsequent to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The arbitration clauses in
these later BITs are generally much broader in their scope and, undoubtedly,
encompass disputes concerning the occurrence of an act of expropriation.”
This further indicates that the restrictive wording of Article 10 arose from the
deliberate intention of the Contracting Parties to limit the scope for arbitration
under the Treaty.

156. The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants’ contention that this
interpretation based on the ordinary meaning of the provision renders Article
10 meaningless for the Contracting Parties. The Tribunal refers to the terms of
the Belgium/Luxembourg — China BIT, which was submitted to the Tribunal
by the Claimants. Article 10 of the BIT provides that any dispute between an
investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party arising from
an investment “shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State where the

investment is located”.“' As an exception to this general rule, Article 10.3 goes

on to provide that “a dispute which arises from an amount of compensation for

expropriation, nationalization or other similar measures” may at the election of
the investor be referred to “an international arbitration without resort to other
means”.

157. The terms of this Belgium/Luxembourg — China BIT leave no doubt as to the
fact that the only disputes which may be submitted to arbitration under such.
treaty are disputes concerning the amount of compensation for expropriation.
Belgium and Luxembourg were nonetheless willing to enter into the treaty with
China and presumably regarded the BIT as a meaningful form of investment
protection despite the restricted scope of the arbitration clause. This indicates a
readiness on the part of Belgium and Luxembourg to accept such limited
recourse to international arbitration in the terms of its BITs. In such light, the
Tribunal cannot accept the Claimants’ contention that the restriction of Article
10 of the Treaty to disputes concerning the amount or mode of compensation
for expropriation renders the provision meaningless for the Contracting Parties.

158. The Claimants have pointed to an explanatory statement made by the Belgian
Minister of Foreign Affairs before the Belgian Parliament in connection with
the ratification of the Treaty. In this statement, the Minister declared that the
Soviet delegation in the iations had accepted arbitration “in al] areas
covered by Article 5” (which would have included the question of whether or
not had occurred). This notwithstanding, the Tribunal finds the language of the
Treaty to be quite clear and in the view of the Tribunal such language could not
possibly lend itself to the interpretation suggested in the explanatory statement.

Scope of the Most Favoured Nation clause

In light of the restrictive scope of Article 10 of the Treaty, the question then
arises as to whether the Claimants can invoke a broader arbitration provision
taken from a different BIT concluded by the Respondent in reliance upon the
MEN clause in Article 2 of the Treaty. Specifically, the Claimants seek to rely
upon the provisions of the Norway — Russian Federation BIT or, in the case of
doubt, the Denmark — Russian Federation BIT.

Under Article 2, each Contracting Party guarantees that the MFN clause shall
be applied to investors of the other Contracting Party with respect to all matters
covered by the Treaty, in particular Articles 4, 5 and 6. The original French
version of the Treaty provides that:

“Chaque Partie contractante garantit que la clause de la nation la plus favorisée sera appliquée
aux investisseurs de l’autre Partie contractante dans toutes les matiéres visées au présent
Accord, et plus particuliérement aux articles 4, 5 et 6...”

The Respondent has objected to the application of the MFN clause on a
number of grounds. By reference to the text of the Protocol the Respondent
contends that the scope of the MFN clause is limited to treatment granted to
states which were OECD members as of the date of the signing of the Treaty.
The Tribunal finds no support for this contention either in the Protocol] or in the
text of the Treaty itself. The Respondent further argues that the reference to
“the territory of the Soviet Union” in the Protocol means that the MFN clause
may only be applied in relation to BITs signed by the Soviet Union and not
BITs signed by the Russian Federation. The Tribunal also rejects this argument
and notes that the official position consistently adopted by the Respondent in
international affairs is that the Russian Federation is the legal successor to the

Soviet Union.

162. The Respondent also raises the objection that the Treaty’s MFN clause may not
be ded to pass the procedural benefits of i treaties. The

 

Claimants, on the other hand, reject this contention and claim that the weight of

 

legal opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of ding MFN to BIT
dispute resolution provisions. In particular, the Claimants rely upon the
decisions in Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain, Siemens v Argentina” and Gas

Natural v Argentina,

163. The case of Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain concerned the requirement, set out in
the arbitration clause of the Argentina — Spain BIT, whereby domestic courts
are to be given the opportunity to deal with a dispute for a period of eighteen
months before such dispute could be submitted to arbitration. Maffezini sought
to avoid the application of this requirement by invoking the dispute settlement
provisions in the Chile — Spain BIT through operation of the MFN clause in the
Argentina — Spain BIT. In finding that the MFN clause could be invoked in this
manner, the arbitral tribunal purported to lay down the following general rule:

“... if'a third-party treaty contains provisions for the settlement of disputes that are more
favorable to the protection of the investor's rights and interests than those in the basic treaty,
such provisions may be extended to the beneficiary of the most favored nation clause as they

are fully compatible with the ejusdem generis principle.”

164. The arbitral tribunal went on, however, to note that there were “some important
limits that ought to be kept in mind.” The tribunal stated that:

“As a matter of principle, the beneficiary of the clause should not be able to override public
policy considerations that the contracting parties might have envisaged as fundamental
conditions for their acceptance of the agreement in question, particularly if the beneficiary is a

private investor, as will often be the case. The scope of the clause might thus be narrower than
it appears at first sight.”"7

The tribunal identified certain examples of such policy considerations which
could not be bypassed by application of an MFN clause, Firstly, one of the
contracting parties may have conditioned its consent to arbitration on the
exhaustion of local remedies. Secondly, the contracting parties may have
agreed to a so-called fork in the road provision, whereby a final and binding
choice is to be made b bmission to d ic courts or to i
arbitration. Thirdly, the agreement may provide for an additional forum such as
ICSID and finally, the parties may have agreed to a highly institutionalised
system of arbitration that incorporates precise rules of procedure, such as
NAFTA. The tribunal added that other elements of public policy limiting the
operation of the clause no doubt would be identified by the parties or tribunals.

165. In Siemens v Argentina the Claimants brought an action under the Germany —
Argentina BIT and invoked the MFN clause contained therein in an attempt to
avoid the application of the same procedural requirement as arose in the
Maffezini case, namely that the local courts be given an opportunity to deal
with the dispute for a period of eighteen months before submission to
arbitration. The arbitral tribunal in the Siemens case largely followed the
decision in Maffezini and allowed the Claimants to rely on the MFN clause in
order to invoke the arbitration clause in the Argentina — Chile BIT, in
accordance with which no pre-arbitration submission to the local courts was
required. The Respondent sought to identify certain public policy
considerations which precluded the application of the MFN clause, but while
the tribunal concurred “with Maffezini that the beneficiary of the MFN clause
may not override public policy considerations judged by the parties to a treaty

essential to their agreement’, it was held that the public policy considerations

adduced by the Respondent were not applicable.

The application of an MFN clause to dispute resolution provisions arose again
in the case of Gas Natural v Argentina. Once again, the Claimants in this case
sought to invoke the MFN clause to avoid the requirement of pre-arbitration
submission to national courts contained in the Spain — Argentina BIT. In its
decision, the tribunal referred extensively to the decisions in Maffezini and
Siemens. On the basis of the broad terms of the MFN clause in the Spain —
Argentina BIT, the Tribunal held that dispute resolution did come within the
scope thereof. This conclusion was stated to be “consistent with the current
thinking as expressed in other recent arbitral awards’? and the tribunal

proclaimed that:

“Unless it appears clearly that the state parties to a BIT or the parties to a particular investment
agreement settled on a different method for resolution of disputes that may arise, most-
favoured-nation provisions in BITs should be understood to be applicable to dispute

settlement.””°

While these cases do, therefore, offer support for the Claimants’ reliance upon
the MEN clause of the Treaty, a significantly different approach is to be found
in the decisions of the arbitral tribunals in Salini v the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan®' and Plama v Republic of Bulgaria. Salini involved a dispute
between two Italian construction companies and the Kingdom of Jordan over
claims under an investment agreement for the construction of a dam. The Italy
— Jordan BIT excluded claims arising out of specific investment agreements
from the ICSID arbitration procedures provided for under the dispute

resolution provision of the Treaty, In accordance therewith, the tribunal held
that its jurisdiction under the BIT was limited to the treaty claims raised by the
Claimants. The Claimants attempted to circumvent the limitations in the
dispute resolution provision by invoking the MFN clause in the BIT, but the
tribunal rejected this argument.

The tribunal distinguished Maffezini on the grounds that the MFN clause in the
Italy — Jordan BIT made no reference to “all matters governed by the
agreement” and hence could not be given as broad an interpretation as the
MFN clause considered in Maffezini. The tribunal also held that the Claimants
had submitted “nothing from which it might be established that the common
intention of the Parties was to have the most-favoured-nation clause apply to
dispute settlement.”*? On the contrary, the limited wording of the arbitration
clause constituted a strong indication that the parties intended to exclude
contractual disputes from ICSID arbitration.

Referring to the Maffezini case, the tribunal stated:

“In the words of the Claimants themselves in this case, the award ‘thas given rise to some
concem with regard to the possible expansive effects of the extension of a Most-Favoured

nation clause to the investors’ right to select different forums’”.**

The tribunal then went on to expressly state its own view on the Maffezini

decision as follows:

“The current Tribunal shares the concerns that have been expressed in numerous quarters with
regard to the solution adopted in the Maffezini case. Its fear is that the precautions taken by the
authors of the award may in practice prove difficult to apply, thereby adding more uncertainties

The case of Plama v Republic of Bulgaria involved a dispute arising out of an
investment made by a Cypriot company in a Bulgarian company which owned
an oil refinery in Bulgaria. The dispute was submitted to ICSID arbitration in
reliance upon the terms of the Energy Charter Treaty (the “ECT”) and the
Cyprus — Bulgaria BIT. While the Cyprus ~ Bulgaria BIT itself did not provide
for ICSID arbitration, the Claimants argued that Bulgaria had consented to
ICSID arbitration by virtue of the MFN clause contained in the treaty. The
claimants contended that the MFN clause must be construed as extending to
more favourable dispute settlement mechanisms than those in the Bulgaria -
Cyprus BIT which are contained in other investment treaties concluded by
Bulgaria.

The tribunal upheld its jurisdiction under the ECT, but concluded that the MFN
provision of the Bulgaria — Cyprus BIT could not be interpreted as providing
consent to submit a dispute under the Bulgaria - Cyprus BIT to ICSID
arbitration. Since the Tribunal had already upheld its jurisdiction under the
ECT, the tribunal’s decision with respect to its jurisdiction under the BIT was
essentially obiter dicta, The issues discussed by the Tribunal in relation thereto

are, however, of direct relevance in the instant case.

The tribunal stated that the basic prerequisite for arbitration is an agreement of
the parties to arbitrate and that such an agreement must be clear and
unambiguous.** Accordingly, if such agreement to arbitrate is to be founded
upon an MEN clause, the intention to incorporate dispute settlement provisions

must be clearly and unambiguously expressed.°”

The tribunal then conducted a detailed review of the case law in the area and in
particular the Maffezini decision. The tribunal referred in depth to the risks of

“disruptive treaty shopping” and the numerous policy considerations identified
by the arbitral tribunal in Maffezini. On this basis, the Tribunal reasoned that:

“., the principle with multiple exceptions as stated by the tribunal in the Maffezini case should
instead be a different principle with one, single exception: an MFN provision in a basic treaty
does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in

another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the
58

Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them.
The tribunal concluded its consideration of the Maffezini case with the

following remarks:

“The decision in Maffezini is perhaps understandable. The case concemed a curious
requirement that during the first 18 months the dispute be tried in the local courts. The present
Tribunal sympathizes with a tribunal that attempts to neutralize such a provision that is
nonsensical from a practical point of view. However, such exceptional circumstances should

not be treated as a statement of general principle guiding future tribunals in other cases where
ns

exceptional circumstances are not present.
In light of these decisions the Tribunal will now consider the issue arising in
the present case. Firstly, the Tribunal must express its firm view that the
fundamental issue in determining whether or not an MFN clause encompasses
the dispute resolution provisions of other treaties must always be an assessment
of the intention of the contracting parties upon the conclusion of each
individual treaty. In each case, the question must be asked as to whether the
contracting parties to the treaty intended the MFN provision to incorporate by
reference the dispute settlement provisions of other treaties. Ultimately, that
question can only be answered by a detailed analysis of the text and, where
available, the negotiating history of the relevant treaty, as well as other relevant

facts.

In seeking to ascertain the true intention of the Contracting Parties in the
instant case, the Tribunal must first determine how the text of the MFN clause
in the Treaty is to be construed. In this regard, the tribunal in the Plama case
discussed certain issues which deserve further consideration.

The Plama tribunal states that an arbitration clause in a BIT is an agreement to
arbitrate, and such agreements should be clear and unambiguous. If this means
that, generally speaking, arbitration agreements should be construed in a
manner which is different in principle from that applied to the construction of
other agreements, this Tribunal finds it doubtful whether such a general
principle can be said to exist. At Jeast under Swedish law, the traditional view
that arbitration clauses should be construed restrictively now tends to be
replaced by a more neutral approach to the effect that arbitration agreements
are construed much in the same manner as other agreements. In many
jurisdictions, there may in fact exist a tendency to interpret arbitration clauses

rather widely.

However, another observation made by the Plama tribunal is that if an
agreement to arbitrate is to be reached by incorporation by reference, doubts as
to the intentions of the parties may arise. The present Tribunal agrees. Thus,
while it may be true that no general principle exists, according to which
arbitration agreements should be construed restrictively, particular care should
nevertheless be exercised in ascertaining the intentions of the parties with
regard to an arbitration agreement which is to be reached by incorporation by

reference in an MFN clause.

This observation may be developed further. There is a fundamental difference
as to how an MEN clause is generally understood to operate in relation to the
material benefits afforded by a BIT, on the one hand, and in relation to dispute
resolution clauses, on the other hand. While it is universally agreed that the
very essence of an MEN provision in a BIT is to afford to investors all material

protection provided by subsequent treaties, it is much more uncertain whether
such provisions should be understood to extend to dispute resolution clauses. It
is so uncertain, in fact, that the issue has given rise to different outcomes in a
number of cases and to extensive jurisprudence on the subject. The issue has
caused the drafters of the United Kingdom model BIT to neutralise this
ambiguity by confirming in Article 3(3) that, for avoidance of doubt, MFN
treatment shall apply to certain specified provisions of the treaty including the

dispute settlement provisions.

180. This general uncertainty about the scope of MFN clauses leaves little room for
any general assumption that the contracting parties to a BIT intend an MFN
provision to extend to the dispute resolution clause. In the words of the Plama
tribunal, the interpretation made in the Maffezini case went beyond what State
Parties to BITs generally intended to achieve by an MFN provision."

181. The tribunal in the Gas Natural case suggested that as a matter of principle
MEN provisions in BITs should be understood to be applicable to dispute
settlement provisions unless it appears clearly that the parties intended
otherwise.*' For the reasons developed above, it should be evident that this
Tribunal cannot accept that standpoint. Instead, the present Tribunal will apply
the principle that an MFN provision in a BIT will only incorporate by reference
an arbitration clause from another BIT where the terms of the original BIT
clearly and unambiguously so provide or where it can otherwise be clearly

inferred that this was the intention of the contracting parties.

182. As explained above, this Tribunal does not derive the requirement for clarity
and lack of ambiguity involved in this test from any general principle to the
effect that arbitration clauses should be interpreted more restrictively than other
agreements. Nevertheless, this test is warranted, in the view of the Tribunal, by

the particular problems discussed above which are posed by the construction of
the scope of MFN provisions in BIT:s.

The Claimants point to the expression “all matters covered by the present
Treaty” and argue that this settles the question: if the MFN clause extends to all
matters covered by the Treaty, surely the ordinary meaning of this expression
must be that it extends to the dispute resolution provisions as well.

With respect to the construction of expressions such as “‘al] matters” or “all
rights” covered by a treaty, it should be noted that, for the reasons discussed
above, not even seemingly clear language like this can be considered to have
an unambiguous meaning in the context of an MFN clause. As emphasised by
the Maffezini tribunal, with regard to treaties which in their MFN clauses speak
of “all rights” or “all matters” subject to the treaty in question, but which do
not provide expressly (our emphasis) that dispute settlement as such is covered
by the clause, “it must be established whether the omission was intended by the
parties or can reasonably be inferred from the practice followed by the parties
in their treatment of foreign investors and their own investors.”

Turning to the issue in the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees that the
ordinary meaning of the words “all matters covered by the present Treaty” is
clear. However, such expression must be seen in its context, particularly in
relation to the concept with which it is intertwined in the text of the Treaty, i.e.
“the most favoured nation clause”. The Treaty itself contains no definition of
the expression “the most favoured nation clause”. However, the Protocol to the
Treaty provides that the Soviet Union will accord, in its territory, to Belgian
investors treatment at least equivalent to that accorded to investors from
countries that are members of the OECD on the date when the Protocol was
signed. This suggests that what the Contracting Parties had in mind was a fairly
standard form of MFN-clause, according to which each Contracting Party
accords, in its territory, to investors from the other Contracting Party, treatment

at least equivalent to that accorded to investors from third countries. The use of
the expressions “treatment” and “in its territory” should be noted. This
language appears to indicate that what the Contracting Parties had in view was
the material rights accorded to investors within the territory of the Contracting

States.

The question must now be asked whether it is possible to apply an MFN clause
defined in this (albeit vague) manner to “all matters covered by the present
Treaty”, as stipulated in Article 2. In the view of the Tribunal, this is clearly

Not the case.

Firstly, Articles 9 and 11 concer the relations between Contracting State
Parties only (Articles 9 and 11) and an MFN clause (which concerns the

treatment of investors) obviously cannot apply to these provisions.

Secondly, Articles 1 (Definitions) and 7 (Subrogation by insurers) deal with
matters which have no relation to the treatment of investors. It is very difficult

to see how an MFN clause could possibly apply to these provisions.

Thirdly, Articles 8, 12 and 13 deal with matters conceming which the
application of an MEN clause is at most a theoretical possibility.

With regard to Article 8.1, it is hardly conceivable that a future treaty could
contain provisions which would improve the treatment of investors already
provided for by that Article. With regard to Article 8.2, it is theoretically
possible, but improbable, that a future treaty could allow the provisions of
agreements between investors of two Contracting Parties to be inconsistent
with the Treaty or with the laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment is made. It is rather doubtful however whether this would entail an

improvement of the treatment of investors.

Articles 12 and 13 deal with questions concerning the period during which
investments are protected under the Treaty and with the date upon which the
Treaty enters into force. It could perhaps be argued that, theoretically, an MFN
clause could operate so as to include retroactive or extended protection for
investors in future treaties. In the view of the Tribunal it is uncertain, however,

whether an MFN clause could ever be interpreted in this manner.

This analysis shows that the expression “all matters covered by the present
Treaty” certainly cannot be understood literally. The MFN clause cannot be
applied at all to several of the matters covered by the Treaty. Moreover, with
respect to a number of other issues encompassed by the Treaty, it remains
unclear whether the MFN clause is of any relevance.

It would seem that the Contracting Parties were aware of the ambiguity of the
expression “all matters covered by the present Treaty”, since they added the
clarification that the MFN clause would apply “particularly to Articles 4, 5 and
6”. Those Articles embrace the classic elements of material investment
protection, i.e. fair and equitable treatment, non-expropriation and free transfer
of funds. Article 10, which contains the provisions concerning dispute
resolution between an investor and a Contracting State Party, is not, however,

included in this clarification.

It may, therefore, be concluded that the expression “all matters covered by the
present Treaty” does not really mean that the MFN provision extends to all
matters covered by the Treaty. Therefore, the “ordinary meaning” of that
expression is of no assistance in the instant case, and the expression as such
does not warrant the conclusion that the parties intended the MFN provision to
extend to the dispute resolution clause. In fact, it would seem that the
Contracting Parties must have realised and accepted that some of the issues
embraced by the Treaty would be excluded from the application of the MFN

provision, The question which must now be addressed is whether dispute

resolution was one of those issues.

At this point of the reasoning, proponents of the view that the dispute
resolution clause should be covered by the MFN provision would argue that the
tight to arbitration is in fact a form of investment protection, of basically the
same kind (“eiusdem generis”) as the material protection afforded by the
Treaty, Consequently, this right to arbitration must be covered by any clause
providing for MFN of i Pp i

 

A further argument, frequently advanced in this context, is that access to
arbitration is in fact such an important form of investment protection that not
extending MFN provisions to arbitration clauses would run counter to the
overriding object and purpose of a BIT, which is to promote and protect
investments.

The problem with these arguments is that they are of a general nature. They
offer strong support for the conclusion that an MFN provision is generally
capable of incorporating by reference a dispute resolution clause and that such
incorporation would typically advance the purpose of BITs. However, these
arguments offer little or no guidance as to whether, in a specific case, the
contracting parties to a treaty, which already provides for arbitration in certain
types of disp actually intended the arbitration clause to be ded in the
future to other kinds of disputes,

In the instant case, a relevant question is whether the Contracting Parties
shared the view that arbitration is an integral part of investment protection and,
therefore, must be covered by an MFN clause. If they did, it must be assumed
that they intended the MFN clause to be extended to Article 10. If they did not,
however, share this view, it becomes much less probable that they intended the

MEN clause to encompass dispute resolution provisions.

199. It is not, of course, possible today to read the minds of the Belgian and Soviet
negotiators at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty, nor do we have access
to any preparatory works which could help us to clarify the views and
intentions of the Contracting Parties. Certain factual circumstances may,

however, provide assistance in this regard.

200. When the Treaty was concluded in 1989, there was no generally accepted
approach to the question of whether an arbitration clause is encompassed by an
MEN provision. Even today, no such common approach can be ascertained.
Furthermore, the issue had, in fact, not even been clearly addressed in the
jurisprudence available at the time. The case which comes closest to dealing
with this question is the Ambatielos Case”. However, as noted by the Plama
tribunal, the ruling of the Arbitration Commission in that case does not relate to
the import of an arbitration clause from another treaty into the basic treaty, but
rather to provisions concerning substantive protection in the sense of denial of

justice in the domestic courts.

201. The ion before the Arbitration C ission in Ambatielos was whether
“administration of justice” was comprised by the term “commerce and
navigation” in the MFN provision in the relevant treaty. The Arbitration
Commission found that it could not be said that administration of justice “must
necessarily be excluded” from the field of application of the MFN clause but
that the question “can only be determined in accordance with the intention of
the ing parties as d d froma ble interpretation of the
Treaty”. In fact, far from formulating a general principle concerning the scope
of an MEN clause, the Arbitration Commission emphasised that this was
essentially a question of interpreting the relevant treaty. When interpreting the
treaty in the dispute before it in accordance with these principles, the

Arbitration Commission found that the MFN clause in that treaty encompassed

“administration of justice”.

Given the fact that the question of whether an arbitration clause is
encompassed by an MFN provision had not been clearly addressed in the
jurisprudence available at the time when the Treaty was concluded, it seems
distinctly conceivable that the Contracting Parties simply did not contemplate
the possibility that the arbitration provision in Article 10 could be embraced by
the MFN clause in Article 2. On the other hand, if indeed the Contracting
Parties did intend Article 2 to apply to Article 10, they must have had a strong
incentive to clarify this in the text of the Treaty in view of the highly uncertain
state of the law. Such clarification could have been achieved by adding Article
10 to the specific references made to Articles 4, 5 and 6 in the MFN clause.
The fact that this was not done creates doubts as to whether any of the
Contracting Parties intended Article 10 to be covered by Article 2.

Certain other facts are of relevance to the intentions on the Soviet side in
particular. On that point the Respondent argues as follows. The Soviet Union
pursued a very consistent policy to the effect that it never consented to
arbitration in BITs concerning questions whether or not an act of expropriation
had occurred. The Soviet Union maintained the principle that this issue was to
be resolved in accordance with national legislation and by the national courts
of the state where the alleged act of expropriation had taken place. Ultimately,
this view stems from the principle of state sovereignty, which was of

fundamental importance to the Soviet Union.

In support of this contention, the Respondent has submitted and relies on
extracts from the BITs entered into by the Soviet Union with Turkey, South
Korea, Switzerland, Spain, China, Austria, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands,
France, Germany and the United Kingdom. A scrutiny of these treaties shows
that they all removed the fact of expropriation from the scope of arbitration.

+46 8 50576501
69(75)

Thus, the principle described by the Respondent was indeed applied
consistently by the Soviet Union. The treaties with Canada and France provide
for investor-state arbitration conceming “the effects” of i.a. expropriation. This
appears to provide for such arbitration in a wider range of issues than the
present Treaty, but still must be understood to exclude the fact of expropriation
itself from arbitration. In the view of the Tribunal, this consistent practice on
the part of the Soviet Union strongly suggests that the Soviet Party did not
intend the MFN provision in Article 2 of the Treaty to extend to dispute

resolution issues.

There are fewer available facts concerning the intentions on the Belgian side.
However, as discussed above, the failure by the Contracting Parties to clarify
whether or not Article 2 was to extend to arbitration provisions tends to support

the view that none of the Contracting Parties had any such intention.

The discussion above can now be summarised as follows. The starting point in
determining whether or not an MFN clause encompasses the dispute resolution
provisions of other treaties must always be an assessment of the intention of
the contracting parties upon the conclusion of the original treaty. The Tribunal
has applied the principle that an MFN provision in a BIT will only incorporate
by reference an arbitration clause from another BIT where the terms of the
original BIT clearly and unambiguously so provide or where it can otherwise
be clearly inferred that this was the intention of the Contracting Parties.

An interpretation of the text of the Treaty in accordance with the principles of
the Vienna Convention is inconclusive. No clear “ordinary meaning” can be
attributed to the terms of Article 2. The object and purpose of the Treaty is
undoubtedly to promote and protect investments, but this is a general statement
which does not contribute to the construction of the terms of Article 2. No
preparatory work or other instrument or agreement relating to the Treaty, or

subsequent agreements or practice in the application of the Treaty provide any

guidance.

A reasonable interpretation of the intentions of the Contracting Parties in light
of the text of the Treaty and other relevant facts shows that it is improbable that
the Soviet Contracting Party intended the MFN provision to embrace
arbitration issues. Moreover, neither does the balance of the facts available
support the conclusion that the Belgian Party had any such intention. For these
reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Treaty does not clearly and unambiguously
provide for incorporation by reference of arbitration clauses in other BITs.
Therefore, the jurisdiction of this Tribunal can be based only on the arbitration
clause contained in Article 10 of the Treaty. As discussed above, the said
arbitration clause does not extend to the matters brought before the Tribunal by

the Claimants.

Fraud on Berschader International

The Respondent has submitted that by bringing this claim the Claimants are
acting in breach of Belgian bankruptcy law and international public order and
that the Tribunal, accordingly, lacks jurisdiction. The Tribunal cannot accept
this contention. The Tribunal is satisfied that the rights being asserted by the
Claimants in this case are their own rights to bring a claim as shareholders
under the Treaty and that these rights are entirely separate and independent
from any similar rights which may be held by BI. The Tribunal cannot, in other
words, accept that the Claimants are unlawfully attempting to assert a claim
which rightfully belongs to BI. Under these circumstances, the question of
whether the Claimants are entitled to represent BI or not can be of no relevance

to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

It is generally recognised that Asticle 40 (2) of the Rules gives the Tribunal
bruad discretion in deciding on the apportionment of the arbitration costs. A
common method is to award costs to the party who prevailed in the
proceedings (costs follow the event). If the claim is dismisscd, it is usually held
in Swedish arbitrations and court proceedings that the claimant is the lusing,
party and theretore is liahlc tn compensate the respondent for costs. However, 4
tribunal acting in accordance with the Rules is by no means bound by these

general guidelines

In the present case, the Tribunal finds that it would not be appropriate simply
to apply the principle that costs follow the event. Firstly, the Claimants had
good reasons for the argument that this I'ribunal has jurisdiction over the
claims; the grounds on which the Tribunal has found thut it lucks jurisdiction
relate to issues which have been exlensively discussed, with different
approaches being udupted by different tribunals. Secondly, the obvious
imbalance between the Parties in economic terms has to be taken into account.
Exercising the disoretion afforded it by the Rulcs, thc Tribunal theretore tinds
that the arbitration costs should be cqually apportioned between the Parties.
The Tribunal notes that this decision appears to be in line with a clear tendency
in international investment arbitrations not to order « lusiny, private party to

bear the winning government party’s costs.

The same principle should be applied with regard to costs for legal
representation. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that each party shall hear its
own costs for legal representation and other costs for presenting its case.

+46 § 50576501

Vladimir Berschader & Moise Berschader v. The Russian Federation
Separate Opinion

1. This is a difficult case involving difficult legal issues upon which reasonable people may
disagree. Unfortunately, I find myself in disagreement with my tribunal colleagues on
two of the issues presented for our decision: the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty with
respect to claims made by qualified investors involving indirect investments made
through an enterprise established by the investor in the country of that investor; and the
applicability of Article 2 of the treaty to Article 10 of the Treaty, concerning the
availability of dispute settlement under this Treaty in cases where more favourable means
of dispute settlement have been agreed to by the Respondent in investment protection
treaties with other OECD Member countries.

2. With respect to all of the other findings of fact and law contained within the Award, I am
in agreement with my colleagues.

3. First, it would be useful to reiterate that this Tribunal must be guided by the terms of the
Treaty,! Interpretation of these terms must be undertaken using the customary law rules
of treaty interpretation, generally recognised to have been memorialised in Article 31 of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Under these rules, the terms of a treaty
must interpreted in good faith in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context
and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.

4, We are in agreement about our need to be guided by the contents of Article 31 of the
Vienna Convention in interpreting the terms of this Treaty. Where we appear to differ is
in its application? While my colleagues concentrate much of their analysis on
identifying the intent of the drafters of the Treaty as of the date of its execution,” I focus
on the treaty terms themselves as the best evidence of ascertaining such intent.

' Article 10:3 of the Treaty indicates that the Tribunal shall base its decision on the terms of the treaty; the
national law of the host state [necessarily in as much as it is relevant to, and appropriate for, the issue];
and the commonly accepted rules and principles of international law.

We also appear to agree that there is no need for recourse to the rules recorded in Article 32 of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. For my part, I have concluded that no recourse to these rules
is required because the plain and ordinary meaning of the relevant treaty terms can be interpreted in their
proper context. Hence, recourse to secondary means of interpretation is unnecessary. My colleagues
have also chosen not to resort to the rules contained within Article 32
3] am reluctant to adopt this approach because it seems to me that when counsel argue to a Tribunal such
as this one about “what the drafters intended” it is normally little more than the deft use of a euphemism
to justify counsel’s arguments as to how the terms of a treaty should be construed, in absence of any
actual evidence on the subject.

“ As demonstrated by the fact that neither party led any evidence conceming the negotiation and
ratification of the Treaty (such as ‘ravaux preparatoires or contemporaneous legislative or executive
statements), the first and best evidence of discerning what the Treaty drafters meant is to found in the
terms of the Treaty. The terms have meaning, particularly within the context of an instrument whose
objectives are to promote and protect foreign investment. This is why Article 32 of the Vienna
Convention directs that recourse to travaux (absent in this case) should only be had in cases where the

+46 8 50576501

5. Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention states that the context for the purposes of treaty
interpretation shall comprise the treaty text itself, its preamble and its annexes, as well as
certain other agreements or instruments that are not relevant for this case. The Treaty’s
preamble is relevant for our interpretation of Articles 1, 2 and 10; its goals and objectives
are stated [albeit in unofficial English] as follows:

DESIRING

to create favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in
the territory of another Contracting Party.

CONSCIOUS

of the positive effect that the present Treaty can have on fostering business contacts and
strengthening trust in the area of investments

6. Given the Treaty’s objectives, I believe that it is incumbent upon the Tribunal to adopt an
interpretation of the terms of Articles 2 and 10 of the Treaty that ensures the promotion of
“favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the
territory of another Contracting Party.”

7. Through their wholly-owned, Belgian-incorporated investment enterprise the investors
engaged in exactly the kind of activity that one would assume was envisaged in the
preambular terms of the Treaty: they built an edifice for the Respondent's Supreme
Court. One could hardly think of a better example of realised business contacts and
strengthened trust than such an undertaking. On the basis of assumed facts, however, onc
could hardly conceive of a more grievous breach of that trust than that which, as alleged
by the Claimants, befell them. They lost their investment; did not receive adequate
compensation; and their investment vehicle was forced into bankruptcy.

8. In my opinion the terms of Article 10, as viewed within the context of the remaining text
of the Treaty, contemplate the protection of investors who indirectly make their
investments in the territory of the other Contracting party through an enterprise
established in the territory of their respective Contracting Party. The provision refers to
“any dispute” between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party as being capable of being submitted to dispute settlement, placing no limits on the
mode of investment involved apart from defining the term “investment.”

9. The term “investment” includes various forms of property under the Treaty. The terms of
the Treaty, including the preamble, indicate that the investment must be made in the
territory of another contracting party in order for it to be covered by the Treaty. This
requirement is similar to that found in most investment protection treaties (and dissimilar
to multilateral economic agreements such as the NAFTA, which contemplates a more

 

normal approach to interpretation leaves the meaning of treaty terms ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a
result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

complicated regime of protection for investors and investments in the free trade area it
created).>

10. 1 am accordingly in agreement with my Tribunal colleagues that shares held in an
investment vehicle not incorporated in the host State cannot constitute investments
protected under the Treaty.

11. There is nothing in the treaty text, however, indicating how the other investments made in

the territory of the Respondent — such as the contract and various other property rights —
must have been made or maintained by the investors directly. Article 10 does not restrict
itself to disputes involving only investments that are directly held by an investor. Nor
does the definition-of “investor” suggest such a limitation.

12. The definition of “investment” does provide some useful context, however. It states that
“{the] term ‘investment’ ‘also means’ indirect investments made by investors of one of
the Contracting Parties in the territory of another Contracting Party by the intermediary
of an investor of a third state.” Contrary to my colleagues’ conclusion, { regard this
clarification as demonstrating how indirect investments made through an intermediary

enterprise are clearly contemplated within the Treaty. Otherwise, there would have been

no need for a clarification dealing with other approved forms of indirect investment.

13. Finally, while ] would agree with my colleagues that most of the cases cited by the
Claimants in support of their position on coverage for indirect investments can be
factually distinguished from the case at bar, with respect J think their analysis misses the
point. As my colleagues acknowledge, cases such as Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela stand for
the proposition that a broad and liberalising approach should be accorded to the
interp ion of the definition of “ ” found in an ii ion treaty.
Whereas my colleagues distinguish this approach as only being appropriate in relation to
cases proceeding under the auspices JCSID, | regard this statement as a conclusion of
general application based upon the common objectives of investment protection treaties
and the applicable customary international law rules of interpretation.’

* The NAFTA created a free trade area between its three signatories, and appears to indicate explicitly
when the obligations it contains apply only to investments made in the territory of another NAFTA Party,
rather than the circumstances in which investments made anywhere in the North American Free Trade
Area receive protection.

° My colleagues effectively adopt a contra proferentum analysis of this paragraph, reasoning that if the
drafters included this provision respecting indirect investments through a foreign intermediary, they must
not have intended to permit indirect investments through a local intermediary. The problem with this
analysis is that it ignores the term “also means” contained within this paragraph. Use of the term “also”
requires there to be some other condition of indirect investment against which one defined is to be
compared. Obviously that other condition would be an indirect investment made by an investor through
an intermediary organized under the laws of its own Contracting Party (rather than those of a foreign
country — whose inclusion would have required elucidation, given the controversy mentioned by my
colleagues with respect to the fact pattern found in the Barcelona Traction case).

7 In this respect I must disagree with the Tribunal’s finding at paragraph 136 that, after concluding that no
case law was directly on point, it should “turn to the text of the Treaty.” With respect, the text of the
Treaty was where it should have started; the purpose of doctrine, as received under Article 31(3 a) of the

21 APR 2006 11:21 MANNHE IMER SWARTL ANG +46 8 58576501 SID 81/84

+46 8 50576501

14. Accordingly, | find that the plain meaning of Articles 1 and 10, taken in context,
contemplate protection for investors who made their investment in an indirect manner
such as the Claimants did, An interpretation of these terms that would deprive the
investors of the rights contemplated in the Treaty — merely by virtue of the corporate
structure they chose to make their investment — is one that places form over substance
and does not comport with the objectives of the Treaty.®

15. I must also disagree with my esteemed colleagues with respect to their interpretation and
application of the Treaty’s MFN treatment provision, Article 2. The English translation
very closely resembles the very broad “all matters” MFN provisions found in cases such
as Maffezini, Gas Natural and Siemens, cited by the Claimants.” The terms of Article 2
differ from the MFN provisions found in the Salini and Plama cases,'° cited in apposition
by my colleagues.

16. 1 find my colleagues’ reliance on the reasoning in these latter two cases unpersuasive.
The Plama analysis on the MFN issue was obiter dictum and accordingly not persuasive
because the reasoning was not dispositive of the final award. It was also wrongly

 

Vienna Convention, is to inform the Tribunal’s interpretation of the Treaty text. In this case, cases such
as Fedax and Genin teach us that we should not adopt a restrictive definition of the Treaty that might
frustrate its objective of investment-liberalisation. See: Fedax N.V. v Venezuela, \CS|D Case No.

Estonia, \CSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award of 25 June 2001;
www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Genin-Estonia-Award-25Jun2001.pdf.

® To be clear, in my opinion there is nothing to be gained in attempting to look behind the plain meaning
of the Treaty text. My colleagues’ attempt to divine what might have been in the minds of the drafters in
1989 in respect of the treatment of indirect investments, mentioned for example in paragraph 141, docs
not comport with the customary rules of treaty interpretation and — in any event — is completely unreliable
in terms of answering the question posed.

"' Georg Schwarzenberger, "The Most-Favoured-Nation Standard in British State Practice” (1945) 22 Br
Y.B. Int'l L. 96 at 99-100, Professor Schwarzenberger noted that the MEN principle, when embodied ina
treaty provision, “consists in forming an agency of equality. It prevents discrimination and establishes
equality of opportunity on the highest possible plane: the minimum of discrimination and the maximum
of favours conceded to any third state... It is clear that m.f.n. clauses serve as insurance against

decided, on this point, as a matter of customary international law interpretation. The
Salini case is clearly distinguishable on the facts, being involved with the interplay
between a concession contract and an investment protection treaty.

As Professor Schwarzenberger observed approximately six decades ago, the MFN
standard is among the most ancient and venerable in international law, placing the
prospective talents of every other country’s drafter at the disposal of the parties to a treaty
who agree to include such a provision in their agreement. A broad-based MFN provision,
covering “all matters” in an investment treaty, such as the provision with which we are
dealing, has thrice been found to extend beyond a mere grant of equality as between the
substantive provisions of two treaties.'' It extends to procedural aspects of the dispute,
including entitlement to pursue arbitration.

Accordingly, and with the doctrinal support of three tribunals composed of some of the
most senior members of the investment treaty bar, 1 find that the terms of Article 2
plainly regulate the possibility that the Contracting Parties may conclude future
investment protection treaties that grant more favourable treatment to a new class of
investors than that for which the Parties were prepared to commit in the older treaty.

My colleagues appear to rely upon the general thrust of the Plama award in support of
their position, albeit with a caveat concerning that tribunal’s general conclusion on the
construction of arbitration clauses."* I am concerned, however, that my collcagues”
approach is really not that different from that of the Plama Tribunal," as both effectively
apply a rule of strict construction to the provision — requiring that it include terms
“clearly and unambiguously” demonstrating how the provision was intended by its
drafters to include recourse to dispute settlement as one of the “matters” against which
the test of ‘most favourable treatment’ should be applied.

The MEN standard is a tried-and-true expression of the international economic law
principle of non-discrimination. In application, its breadth and depth are limited
primarily by restrictive language found in the text of a treaty (such as general exception
clauses and reservation schedules) and by the requirement that most favourable treatment
be accorded only to those who stand in like circumstances. There is simply no reason to
suppose that — absent some specific treaty language — any given MFN provision should

 

conclusion of international treaties ... it is thus that the standard of m.f.n. treatment has the effect of
utting the services of the shrewdest negotiator of a third country at the disposal of one’s own country...”
? At paragraph 177 of the Award, my colleagues refer to the state of the law on arbitration in Sweden as

having passed from a period where strict construction of an arbitration clause has been replaced by a

“more neutral approach” to understanding the meaning of their text. They do not mention the applicable

customary laws of treaty interpretation at this point.

'° See, in particular, paragraphs 181-182 of the Award.

be more or less narrowly defined. In other words, MFN clauses apply to all aspects of
the regulatory environment governed by an investment protection treaty, including
availability of all means of dispute settlement.'*

21. My colleagues have parsed the entire text of the Treaty to conclude that the term “all
matters” found in Article 2 cannot really mean that the MFN obligation should extend to
“all matters” covered under the Treaty. They note how various provisions do not lend
themselves to a MFN analysis, such as those that include definitions or that govern
relations between the Contracting Parties. They also note, somewhat more compellingly,
that Article 2 expressly references the other substantive provisions of the Treaty (Articles
4, 5 and 6) as being covered under its auspices, but not Article 10 (which provides access
for the Claimants to dispute settlement).

22. It is important to note, however, that Article 2 does not restrict itself to Articles 4, 5 and
6; it merely indi that this non-exclusive list of sub e obli are
“particularly” covered by the MFN obligation. With respect to the provisions of the
Treaty that do not apparently lend themselves easily to a MFN analysis, I would only
suggest that “‘all matters” in context obviously means ‘all matters from which one may be

capable of deriving more ot less favourable treatment.”

23. Because the MFN provision at issue in this case is clear and unambiguous, particularly
when read in the light of the MFN principle, as well as prior jurisprudence regarding the
similar application of a virtually identical provision, I can see no justification for looking
to the subsequent treaty practice of the Contracting Parties for an indication of whether it
was intended to cover recourse to dispute settlement.'° What the Contracting Parties
might have agreed upon in later situations with other partners says nothing conclusive
about what the terms of the instant Treaty actually mean.

24. — IfI was to venture down this path, however, the conclusion I would reach is that my
interpretation of Article 2 has been strengthened by subsequent practice; not weakened.
The Respondent has apparently entered into agreements with other OECD members,
France and Canada, wherein greater concessions towards investment liberalisation, and
investor-state dispute settlement, were offered. More importantly, the very fact that the
Respondent entered into a large number of agreements affer it agreed to the instant Treaty
is actually demonstrative of the fact that its partners in this Treaty were ‘first-movers’ for
whom a broad and remedial MFN provision would be crucially important.

'$ Tn this case, and as my colleagues have correctly surmised, we have a very clear restriction placed upon
the MFN obligation in this Treaty; it applies only to agreements reached by the Respondent with other
OECD members. Unlike my colleag however, I lude that the very exi: of this
demonstrates how no other implicit limitation was intended for the MFN provision contained within this
Treaty.

'S Again, the customary international law rules of treaty interpretation do not call upon us to decide what
was in the minds of the drafters of a treaty as of the day it was signed, or came into force. In light of the
objectives of the Treaty and when read in their proper context, the terms are supposed to speak for
themselves.

The Claimants seek the benefit of treaties concluded by the Respondent with other OECD
members that would allow them to have recourse to dispute settlement for the
expropriation and breaches of other treaty standards they have alleged. The plain
meaning of the terms of Article 2 support their petition; as do the applicable rules of
international law and arbitral jurisprudence; as does the context of the Treaty text.
Accordingly I would have granted their request.'®

For the foregoing reasons, I would have dismissed the Respondent’s preliminary
objections and ordered the parties to proceed to a hearing on the merits of the claim.

Finally, as some of the objections raised by the Respondent posed legitimate questions
for the Tribunal’s consideration on a preliminary basis, I would have ordered that cach
party bear its own costs for legal repr ion and other exp bome in p ing its
case; and I would have ordered the arbitration costs for the preliminary phase of the
hearing to be apportioned equally between them.

‘In other words, the “starting point” for this Tribunal’s analysis should not have been “an assessment of
the intention of the contracting parties upon the conclusion of the original treaty,” as stated in paragraph
206 of the Award. It should have been: “the terms of the Treaty, interpreted in good faith in accordance
with their ordinary meaning, in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.”
