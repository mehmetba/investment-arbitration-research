proceed as soon as possible to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Article 1123 NAFTA specifies the number of arbitrators and the method of their
appointment to constitute a Tribunal: unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the
Tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party, and a
presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the parties.

On March 10, 2016 the Claimant appointed Mr. David J. A. Cairns, a national of the United
Kingdom and New Zealand, as an arbitrator in this case. Mr. Cairns accepted his
appointment and provided his curriculum vitae.

On May 10, 2016 the Respondent appointed Mr. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez, a national of
Mexico, as an arbitrator in this case. Mr. Ramirez Hernandez accepted his appointment and
provided his curriculum vitae.

After the Parties failed to reach an agreement on the presiding arbitrator, in accordance with
Article 1124 NAFTA, the Secretary-General served as appointing authority. On July 20,
2016, the Secretary-General appointed Juan Fernéndez-Armesto, a national of Spain, as
President of the Tribunal. Pursuant to Arts. 11(2) and 13 ICSID AF Rules, Mr. Fernandez-
Armesto accepted the appointment by letter of July 27, 2016, attaching his declaration of
independence and impartiality.

Decision on Jurisdiction

 

Iv. SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS

This section describes the factual background of the transactions carried out by Lion in
Mexico. The Tribunal has made no independent enquiry or investigation into the facts. The
summary is based on Claimant’s account, which Mexico does not dispute: “Los hechos en
si mismos”, Mexico points out in its last submission, “no se encuentran en disputa’*. It is
the legal assessment of these facts that is at issue.

LION MEETS MR. CARDENAS

Claimant, Lion Mexico Consolidated LP, is a limited partnership constituted under the laws
of Quebec (Canada), with its main place of business in Texas (USA). Lion was created and
is managed by Clarion Partners, L.P. [“Clarion”], a real estate investment management
company founded in New York in 1982, which manages real estate investments for
institutional investors”.

Lion has been making investments in Mexico for over ten years. Over that period, Lion has
provided more than US $800 million of capital to entities doing business in Mexico, to be
used in developing a wide array of real estate properties, such as hotels, office buildings,
residences, warehouses, and resorts”°,

Clarion engaged Real Capital Investment Management to identify and present investment
opportunities in Mexico”’, and through this channel Mr. Héctor Cardenas Curiel, a Mexican
businessman, was introduced to Lion and Clarion?’. Mr. Cardenas was presented as a
developer seeking funding for the development of two real estate development projects: the
Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project.

MR. CARDENAS’S PROJECTS

The Nayarit Project [Nayarit Project”] included an ocean-front residential and resort
development in Bahia de Banderas, State of Nayarit?®. The development plan called for a
mixed-use high-end resort to be anchored by a Ritz Carlton hotel, 1,500 luxury residential
units, extensive amenities offerings, and two ocean-front golf courses, among other features
to be developed on 855 hectares (2,100 acres) with 2.8 miles of ocean frontage™’.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Guadalajara Project (“Guadalajara Project”}"! consisted of two high-end mixed-use
skyscrapers [“Américas I” and “Américas II”’], which were to be built on approximately
15,000 m2 (3.74 acres) in the city of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco*.

Mr. Cardenas’s plans for the development of the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project
were preliminary and incomplete at the time he requested capital from Lion to acquire land
and begin limited infrastructure development*’. Lion was willing to provide capital for the
development of these projects subject to requirements including the following:

- The granting of mortgages to Lion over the land acquired by Mr. Cardenas and on the
subsequent improvements made on that land™; and

- The issue of promissory notes to Lion as unconditional commitments to repay the
money owed to Lion, with certain procedural privileges under Mexican law*>.

THE THREE SETS OF TRANSACTIONS

In February, June, and September 2007, Lion made three loans for financing the purchase
of the properties for the Nayarit Project and the Guadalajara Project [the Loans”], as well
as working capital. Lion provided the Loans to two Mexican companies owned or controlled
by Mr. Cardenas [“the Borrowers”):

- Inmobiliaria Bains, S.A. de C.V. [Inmobiliaria Bains”),
- C&C Capital, S.A. de C.V. [“C&C Capital”).

The three Loans, with a principal amount of approximately US $32.8 million, were secured
by three mortgages and the issue of three promissory notes.

The three promissory notes [the “Notes”] were all issued under Mexican law, drafted both
in English and Spanish (with the Spanish version governing) and submitted to the exclusive
and irrevocable jurisdiction of the courts of Mexico, D.F.

The three mortgages [the “Mortgages”] were signed before a notary public, in Spanish
language and subject to Mexican law, namely, the applicable laws of the States of Jalisco
[“Guadalajara Mortgages 1 and 2”] and Nayarit [“Nayarit Mortgage”]”°.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Guadalajara Mortgage 2 was recorded at that Property Public Registry on 6 December
2007.

THE DEFAULTS

The initial deadlines for repayment of all three Loans were not met. Mr. Cardenas requested
and obtained a series of time extensions: from March 2008 through July 2009, Lion signed
maturity date extensions on the First Loan four times>!, on the Second Loans seven times*”,
and on the Third Loan six times”.

The last payment date on the three transactions was, ultimately, September 30, 2009, and
the debtors failed to satisfy the outstanding amounts by that date. All three Loans were
declared in default and interest at the default rate began to accrue on October 1, 2009.

Lion sent its first invoice to Mr. Cardenas for the outstanding principal and interest
payments due on April 16, 2010°4. The amounts due on that invoice, calculated and dated
as of March 31, 2010, totaled US $26,618,972 for the Nayarit Project and US $29,649,835
for the Guadalajara Project.

Subsequent invoices were sent on July 14, 2010°°; October 11, 2010°°; February 14, 201 17,
April 12, 20115, and July 29, 2011°°.

The amounts due on the latest invoices sent, calculated and dated as of June 30, 2011, were
US $36,041,328.45 for the Nayarit Project and US $40,065,210.38 for the Guadalajara
Project.

According to Lion, no payments were ever made.

LATER DEVELOPMENTS

In view of the defaults, in February 2012 Lion sought to enforce its rights judicially. In the
following years Lion repeatedly filed legal actions before the Mexican courts. Lion submits
that the Mexican courts and public registries engaged in improper conduct, allowing a fraud
based upon a forged loan restructuring agreement, which resulted in the unlawful
cancellation of Lion’s Mortgages and Notes. In its words at the hearing”.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

“Unfortunately, Cardenas failed to move forward with these Projects as planned and
didn’t repay the capital as required under the Contract with [Lion]. As you know, [Lion]
has alleged that it was wrongfully stripped off its Mortgages and Notes by the
fraudulent conduct of various Mexican courts and public registries over a period of
three years ...”

Lion has brought this arbitration against Mexico under NAFTA to address the unlawful
taking of its property (allegedly, a violation of Art. 1110 NAFTA) and Mexico’s failure to
provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security (Art. 1105 NAFTA).
Lion is asking the Tribunal to issue an award for damages representing the value of its
investment, lost as a result of Mexico’s breach of NAFTA.

Vv. RELIEF SOUGHT

93. In its Memorial, Lion submitted the following request for relief*!:

“The Claimant respectfully request the Tribunal:

a) To declare that Mexico has breached its obligations under Articles 1110 and 1115 of
NAFTA and international law;

b) To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the loss caused by the cancellation of the
Mortgages in the amount of US $76,343,347.00 or, alternatively, US $74,706,873;

c) To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the additional loss caused by cancellation of
the Notes in an amount to be determined at a later stage;

d) To order Mexico to pay the Claimant the legal fees incurred in the Mexican court

e) To order Mexico to pay interest on the amounts under (b) to (d) at the Mexican Legal
rate provided by Article 362 of the Mexican Commercial Code compounded monthly,
through the date of full and effective payment of those amounts or, alternatively, at the
monthly interest rate of the 28-day Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIE);

f) To order Mexico to reimburse Claimants all their reasonable legal costs and fees in
connection with this arbitration; and

g) Any other remedies that the Tribunal consider appropriate in the circumstances given
Mexico’s breaches”.

94. In its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Lion asked the Tribunal for the following relief®*:

“140. For the reasons discussed above, the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral
Tribunal to issue a decision on jurisdiction rejecting Mexico’s Jurisdictional Objection
and declaring that the Mortgages and Notes are indeed investments under NAFTA.
Article 1139; and, consequently that it has ratione materiae jurisdiction to adjudicate
the claims brought by the Claimant; thus ordering the proceedings to continue and the
Respondent to file the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial in the period remaining,
according with the Amended Timetable.

141. The Claimant also requests the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay
all of the costs of the arbitration including the costs of representation associated with
the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation and with the jurisdictional phase”.

VI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES

97. Under Art. 45 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules “the Tribunal shall have the
power to rule on its competence”.

98. Mexico asks the Tribunal to rule that it lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione
personae, arguing that Lion never made an investment in Mexico within the terms required
by Art. 1139 NAFTA and consequently failed to qualify as a protected investor under the

Treaty.

original maturity of “at least three years”

. And none of the Loans meets this threshold.

Claimant’s argument is different. The Loans, documented in the Credit Agreements, were
additionally secured by the Mortgages and formalized in the Notes (pagarés no
negociables). Lion says that the Mortgages and the Notes by themselves qualify as protected

investments:

- the Mortgages under Art. 1139(g), as “intangible real estate”, and

- the Notes under Art. 1139(h), which extends coverage to “interests arising from the
commitment of capital”®”.

Mexico disagrees and avers that Lion only made three short-term Loans, which constitute a
single economic transaction that does not meet the three-year maturity threshold for the
inclusion of loans as an investment within the meaning of Art. 1139(d). The fact that Lion
chose to secure the Loans by the issue of the Notes, and the granting of the Mortgages does
not, in Mexico’s submission, change the conclusion: there is one single economic
transaction and one single investment.

The Tribunal will first summarize Respondent’s (1.) and Claimant’s (2.) positions, and then
briefly address the experts’ opinions (3.).

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Mexico says that Claimant made no valid investment under Art. 1139 NAFTA and therefore
the Tribunal lacks ratione personae and ratione materiae jurisdiction to hear Lion’s claims.

Mexico’s position turns on the following arguments:
- Lion’s actual investment was to lend three short-term loans only (1.);
- The Notes, Mortgages, and Loans are part of a single legal transaction (2.);

- The Mortgages and Notes do not qualify as investments under Art. 1139 NAFTA (3.).

LION’S ACTUAL INVESTMENT WAS TO MAKE THREE SHORT-TERM LOANS ONLY

The sole economic operation carried out by Lion was to make three short-term loans to
Mexican entities, an operation that does not qualify as a protected investment under Art.
1139 NAFTA, as acknowledged by Claimant®*. The three Loans were documented through
three instruments, with the sole purpose of securing payment of the debt — this is their raison
d’étre® —and they cannot be considered as separate investments”’. The definition of “loans”
in Art. 1139(d) NAFTA includes loans documented in notes and secured by mortgages.
Since the Loans in the present case have a maturity date of less than three years, they do not
constitute investments. This should be the end of the analysis”!.

 

The following facts and legal arguments support this conclusion:

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

First, Lion did not intend to invest in promissory notes or mortgages. The language of the
Credit Agreements makes clear that the Notes and the Mortgages were an express condition
to grant each Loan”. In fact, each Loan was implemented through a Credit Agreement, a
Note, and one or more Mortgages’*.

Second, the definition of “Credit Documents” under the Credit Agreements expressly
includes not only the Credit Agreements, but also the Mortgages and the Notes”*. Each Loan
was subject to the conditions set out in the Credit Agreements, and “any other applicable
conditions ... under any other Credit Documents”, which include its respective Note and
Mortgage — Credit Agreements, Notes and Mortgage are therefore deemed to be part of the
same operation”.

Third, the terms of the Notes and of the Mortgages just mirror the terms of the Credit
Agreements as to their parties, date of execution, amount of principal, due date, ordinary
interest rate, default interest rate, etc. These Notes and Mortgages provide Lion with an
additional mechanism to recover the debt generated by the Loans. Accordingly, the Notes
cannot constitute a separate or independent debt”®.

. The several extensions granted by Lion to their debtors confirm the fact that the Notes only

document the debt created by the Loans. Each extension was implemented through the
amendment of the Credit Agreements, which required the cancellation and delivery of the
Notes to the creditor and the execution of a new Note in the terms established in the relevant
Credit Agreement”’.

MORTGAGES, NOTES, AND LOANS: ONE SINGLE LEGAL TRANSACTION

If the Loans did not exist, the Notes and the Mortgages would not exist either, as their
existence and economic value depends on the Loans’*. The validity and enforceability of a
promissory note or a mortgage depends on the existence of the debt or obligation
guaranteed. Once the loans are paid back, the security right of mortgage and the promissory
note lose their purpose and become unenforceable”. In this case, the Mortgages were mere
accessory contracts®?,

In fact, the subject matter of the debtor’s obligation is the same in the three legal acts:
formalizing or securing the repayment of the Loans. This confirms the link between the
three legal acts in such a way that it is not possible to talk about three independent

transactions or negotia with independent economic value. The fact that each legal act is
governed by a different legal regime does not change this conclusion. To find otherwise
would amount to conclude that three different debts exist®!.

Furthermore, the mortgage is a security right created in real property that is never delivered
to or owned by the creditor*’, the only right conferred by the mortgage is a preferential right
to get paid from the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property**. This conclusion is not
different even if, as in this case, the Civil Codes of Nayarit and Jalisco consider the mortgage
as real property*4.

Finally, the fact that mortgages and promissory notes have each its own legal features is
irrelevant; it just means that payment of the one debt can be obtained through different
avenues before the courts in case of the debtor’s default®*. But it does not turn the Notes,
the Mortgages, and the Loans into independent operations*®.

Consequently, as part of a single legal transaction, the Notes and the Mortgages are subject
to the same legal requirements as the Loans to become a protected investment under Art.
1139(d); hence, the requisite of the three-year duration also applies to the Notes and
Mortgages, as the instruments securing the Loans*’.

Correct interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA
A correct interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA further reinforces the above conclusion:

First, if the Notes and the Mortgages could be considered separately, that would allow
protection of any loans — regardless of their original maturity — by just adding a security or
an instrument. This was not the intention of NAFTA signatories**. The parties to NAFTA
sought to restrict the protection to those loans that fulfill the requirements of Art. 1139(d)
NAFTA®®. Claimant’s interpretation would cause an absurd anomaly: unguaranteed loans
would be subject to the three-year requirement, while guaranteed loans would not; and it
would also allow the protection of loans to State enterprises (which are expressly excluded),
provided they are guaranteed by a mortgage or another security right”.

Decision on Jurisdiction

Second, a consistent, comprehensive interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA under the
principles of Art. 31.1 the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [“WCLT”] demands
to read the provision and its paragraphs (d), (g) and (h) jointly and therefore, to link and
apply the three-year requirement to the Mortgages and the Notes as well®!. This
interpretation gives meaning collectively to the three paragraphs, whilst Lion’s
interpretation suggests that paragraph (d) only refers to non-guaranteed loans, which is
wrong as it adds language to the text”.

Summing up, a correct interpretation leads to the conclusion that the three-year restriction
of paragraph (d) of Art. 1139 NAFTA also applies to security rights and promissory notes
that guarantee loans. If a mortgage or promissory note is not linked to a loan, the three-year
requirement is not relevant; but if the guaranteed asset is a loan, the correct interpretation
requires that a consistent meaning is given to Art. 1139 NAFTA as a whole”.

MORTGAGES AND NOTES ARE NOT INVESTMENTS UNDER ART. 1139 NAFTA

Even if the Mortgages and the Notes were considered as separate investments from the
Loans, neither of them fits within the definitions of Arts. 1139(g) and 1139(h) NAFTA:
the ordinary meaning of paragraphs (g) and (h) exclude the Mortgages and the Notes from
their scope”*.

As for the Mortgages, they are not property but rights in rem. Due to its own nature, a
mortgage cannot be considered “bienes raices u otra propiedad tangible o intangible” under
Art. 1139(g) NAFTA. Their purpose is to secure the payment of the loan up to the secured
amount, and they are activated after the debtor’s default only. They are thus contingent
rights”.

Lion wrongly argues that the definition of “property” must be established under Mexican
law’. Yet the local law of a signatory cannot be used to interpret the Treaty: the
interpretation must be carried out from the language itself of NAFTA, taking into account
the ordinary meaning of the text and taking into account the context, object, and purpose of
NAFTA and the principle of effet utile, as demanded by Art. 31 of VCLT®’.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Lion contends that the Mortgages and the Notes constitute valid investments under Art.
1139(g) and Art. 1139(h) NAFTA, respectively. Therefore, the Tribunal has both ratione
materiae jurisdiction and ratione personae jurisdiction to adjudicate the present dispute.

Lion’s position can be summarized as follows: under Mexican law, the Loans, the Notes,
and the Mortgages constitute three different negotia (1.). It follows that Mortgages and
Notes are “investments” under Art. 1139(g) and 1139(h) NAFTA (2.).

LOANS, NOTES, AND MORTGAGES CONSTITUTE THREE DIFFERENT NEGOTIA

Three different negotia were concluded in this case: the Loans, the Notes, and the
Mortgages”*. The three negotia are related but still different and separate”. Mexico’s
reasoning is flawed for various reasons!°:

First, independence does not mean that notes or mortgages must each create a new
obligation. The Notes and the Mortgages are separate negotia from the Loans, with different
objects and different parties (in the case of the Mortgages) and separate legal regimes'®!. In
fact, mortgages are a right in rem, effective erga omnes, which allows the creditor to follow
the asset even if owned by a third party; this entirely transcends the personal obligation of
the loans!™.

 

Claimant does not dispute the fact that whenever there is a mortgage there is a loan (or any
other underlying obligation), or that a guarantee is intended to secure a principal transaction.
Whenever there is accessoriness, there are two assets: the principal and the accessory!°?, as
acknowledged by the Supreme Court and the Mexican legal authorities!™. And these
interests require separate treatment for purposes of Art. 1139 NAFTA!.

Second, Loans, Mortgages, and Notes do not have the same object, even if they refer to the
same debt. A mortgage creates different property rights and economic interests compared
to a loan. While loans have as their object a payment obligation, mortgages provide the
possibility for the creditor to be paid from the sale of the mortgaged asset!°°. But mortgages
provide the creditor with much more than just a different procedural avenue to claim the
underlying debt: mortgages create substantive rights that go beyond the right under a loan,
because they allow the creditor to use a specific asset to obtain payment with full priority,

regardless of the solvency of the debtor; they also limit the powers of the owner over the
asset and they grant the creditor power to protect the value of the asset!©’.

Therefore, mortgages are autonomous and confer separate economic value!”®. In contrast
with the value of the loan, the economic value of the mortgage is unaffected by the debtor’s
solvency and will remain equal to the value of the asset, as a consequence of the preference
granted over the asset!.

Third, while the debtor under a loan undertakes a “debt”, the owner of a mortgaged asset
(which can be different from the debtor) assumes a “liability” under the mortgage: if the
debtor breaches the guaranteed obligation, the owner will suffer the sale of the asset for the
benefit of the creditor. No duplication or unjust enrichment takes place!"”.

MORTGAGES AND NOTES ARE “INVESTMENTS” UNDER ARTS. 1139 (G) AND 1139(H)

The Mortgages and the Notes can be characterized as “investments” under Art. 1139
NAFTA, separately and independently from the Loans!!'. The Mortgages squarely fall
within the categories “real estate or other property” provided by Art. 1139(g) NAFTA!!?
(A.). The Notes fall within the category of “commitment of capital” under Art. 1139(h)
NAFTA! (B.). Furthermore, Mexico’s proposed interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA is
mistaken (C.).

The Mortgages are “real estate” and “property”

NAFTA does not define the terms “real estate” or “property”. Therefore, and unless Mexico
shows that the NAFTA State parties intended to refer to an autonomous understanding of
the terms “real estate” and “property”, it is necessary to refer to municipal law where the
property is located!'"*.

Under Mexican law

Consistent with the above, NAFTA State parties and authors, opine that it is appropriate to
look at the law of the host State (in this case, Mexico) for a determination of the definition

and scope of “real estate” and “property”!'>. Other international tribunals have seconded
this view by holding as follows!!®:

“In order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of
constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law.
Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain
protections to property rights created according to municipal law”.

135. Under the Mexican civil codes that govern the Mortgages, all rights in rem are considered
“real estate” (“bienes inmuebles”)''’. Thus under Mexican law, mortgages are considered
“real estate”, which is a protected category of “asset” under Art. 1139(¢) NAFTA!''®. The
Claimant notes that even Mexico and its expert have acknowledged so!!”.

136. Mexico’s NAFTA-based treaty practice shows that, with only one exception, mortgages are
not considered as “related property rights”, but interchangeably as either “other tangible or
intangible property”, “other rights in rem”, “autres droits réels” or “derechos reales”, “other
rights”, “other property rights” or “otros derechos de propiedad” or, as in NAFTA, as an

example of “tangible or intangible property”!”°.

137. Twelve out of the twenty-one investment treaties concluded by Mexico with an express
mention of mortgages as investments characterize them as “rights in rem”'?!. Other treaties
refer to “property rights” (“derechos de propiedad”)'” when referring to rights in rem such
as usufructs and mortgages!?*. Conversely, the expression “related property rights” is found

primarily in the treaties concluded by the United States and only in one of the Mexican
bilateral investment treaties: the Mexico-Singapore BIT!™4.

Under international law

138. The term “property” has a broad meaning under international law and includes rights in and
over a property, i.e., in rem rights!°.

139. International tribunals that adopt an autonomous understanding of the term “property” have
explained that!”°:

“[p]roperty can be defined as those material things which can be possessed, as well as
any right which may be part of a person’s patrimony; that concept includes all movable
and immovable, corporal and incorporeal elements and any other intangible object
capable of having value”.

140. Hence, the term “property” used in investment treaties may be understood to refer to both
things and rights over such things. “Property” refers to a bundle of in rem rights'?’. In
contrast, Mexico seems to understand “property” as limited to the right of full ownership,
implying that the words “related property rights” cover rights over things other than full
ownership!”°.

141.

However, the ordinary meaning of “property” in the international arena encompasses or is
inherently associated with the “rights” over a property, which includes mortgages!”?:

“Property” may be broadly defined under international law as an entitlement of a person
that is related to a thing. It consists of certain rights with regard to the thing that are
usually effective against all other persons, that is, in rem rights”.

142. Therefore, “property” cannot reasonably mean just the thing, nor its full ownership. Full
ownership of a thing is one such legal interest. There are other in rem legal interests,
including mortgages!”°.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The term “property” in Art. 1139(g) NAFTA was used generically by the NAFTA Parties.
It operates as an umbrella, covering, in addition to real estate, “other property” (tangible or
intangible) recognized as such in the respective domestic laws of the NAFTA Parties,
which, in the case of Mexico, include mortgages!*!.

aK

It follows from the above that the lack of reference to mortgages or “related property rights”
in Art. 1139(g) NAFTA does not prevent the Mortgages from been characterized as “real
estate or other property” pursuant to the international usus loquendi of the term
“property”!*?. Under such usus loquendi, the term “property” consists of certain rights with
regard to a thing, including those arising from mortgages. The terms “‘biens”/“bienes” used
in the French and Spanish versions of the NAFTA are understood as expropriable and
appropriable movable and immovable elements, including rights in rem'**. Further evidence
of the international usus loquendi can be found in the treaty practice of the NAFTA State
parties, especially those treaties with a definition of “investment” based on Art. 1139
NAFTA. An examination of such treaties shows that, as per Mexico’s own usus loquendi:

- mortgages are treated within the paragraph defining property as an investment; and

- mortgages are treated separately from loans!™.

The Notes are a valid investment

The Notes are interests of economic nature arising as a result of the commitment of capital
of Lion in Mexico and used for an economic activity; as such, they are also a protected
investment under Art. 1139(h) NAFTA.

The Notes are “interests”:

- under Mexican law (“titulos de crédito”) containing a person’s (subscriber)

unconditional promise to pay to another person (holder) a determined sum of
money!,

- following Canada’s understanding of the ordinary meaning of “interests”!*°.

Furthermore, the destination of the commitment was clearly an “economic activity” in
Mexico: the disbursements made by Lion were intended and used to provide Mexican

companies with the funds for the acquisition of land in Mexico and working capital to
develop them!*’.

C.  Mexico’s interpretation of Art. 1139 NAFTA is ill-conceived

148. First, Art. 1139(d) NAFTA only refers to loans. There is no reference to mortgages,
promissory notes or, more broadly, guarantees securing a loan'**. The ordinary meaning of
the term “loan” in Art. 1139 does not include mortgages, something different and separate
from a loan. A mortgage may not exist without an obligation, but an obligation (e.g., a loan)
can certainly exist without a mortgage!*”.

149. The term “loan” is used in three other provisions in Chapter 11 in addition to Art. 1139
NAFTA (i.e., Arts. 1108, 1109 and 1110). Under these provisions, loans are treated as
separate and distinct from guarantees, and only as credits and monetary obligations'“°, And
it is used in seven provisions outside Chapter 11, only three being relevant and in two of
them (Arts. 1001(5)(a) and 1201(2)(d)) loans are listed as separate assets from their
guarantees!4!,

150. Similarly, there is no reference in paragraphs (g) and (h) to loans, nor is there any reference
to a duration requirement of any sort. The fact that paragraphs (g) and (h) are self-standing
is furthermore confirmed by the lack of cross-references to paragraph (d), in contrast to
other categories listed as investment in Art. 1139 NAFTA'. The drafters of the NAFTA
carefully identified the paragraphs that were intertwined or connected!*; and yet nothing
in paragraphs (g) and (h), or in any other paragraph of Art. 1139, indicates or implies that
the qualification of a real-estate interest or interests arising from the commitment of capital
as an investment is subordinated to other paragraphs of Art. 1139!4.

151.

Second, the definition of “investment” under Art. 1139 NAFTA is constituted by eight
paragraphs, based upon categories of property rights and economic interests, not business
activities'4°, But this does not mean that all the requirements, conditions, and exceptions
included in each one of these eight paragraphs must be cumulatively complied with, under
the pretext that the ordinary meaning of one those paragraphs shall be read in context. On

the contrary, the fact that a condition is included in one of the paragraphs, and not in the
general heading that precedes the paragraphs, suggests that the condition in question is
applicable to that paragraph and not to the others!4”.

Since the language of paragraphs (g) and (h) of Art. 1139 NAFTA does not contain any
reference to the three-year requirement found in other paragraphs of Art. 1139 NAFTA"®,
as Mexico itself has noted, “seria una interpretacién inadmisible dado que implicaria
anadir una palabra al Parrafo ... que no se encuentra ahi”.

Third, Art. 1139 NAFTA is a definition by enumeration of the economic interests that can
be considered to be a covered investment. Only three out of these eight categories include
restrictions such as the three-year initial maturity duration for loans (paragraphs (c), (d) and
(f))'°. The three-year requirement is thus an exception and must be interpreted restrictively,
pursuant to the general principle exceptiones sunt strictae interpretationis'>'. This principle
entails that a requirement such as the three-year original maturity cannot be applied to any
other hypothesis except those to which the text of Article 1139 NAFTA expressly provides
it applies'>*. In fact, the only limitation concerning “real estate” or “property” under
paragraph (g) is that they shall be acquired or used for an “economic benefit or other
business purpose”.

Fourth, given that the Mortgages qualify as an investment under paragraph (g) and the Notes
under paragraph (h) of Art. 1139 NAFTA, such characterization must produce an effet
utile!

The effet utile doctrine is generally understood as follows!**:

“This rule is sometimes invoked as a principle — according to which the interpreter has
sometimes to presume that the authors of a treaty, by adopting the wording of a
disposition, meant to give it a certain meaning in order for this disposition to receive
an effective application”.

The doctrine is not intended to give guidance in determining whether the asset under
consideration is a loan, real estate or property or a commitment of capital. The doctrine
simply states that the rules governing any of those categories shall be given their full effect

THE EXPERTS’ POSITIONS

The Tribunal will first provide a summary of the expert opinion submitted by Respondent
(1.) and then of the one produced by Claimant (2.).

THE IRRA OPINIONS

Respondent retained Lic. René Irra Ibarra to serve as expert on Mexican law in this
arbitration. He submitted two reports with his opinions!®°.

Lic. Irra testified at the Hearing and ratified the main arguments established in his reports.
In particular, he developed the following arguments!*!:

- Lic. Irra identified as his main disagreement with Claimant’s expert that in his view
there are not three different negotia; there is just one negotium, evidenced by three
legal acts, which are separate, because a mortgage is not a promissory note, and
neither of them is a loan; but the existence of three legal acts does not imply that they
are different negotia'”.

- The Loans are the underlying transaction that gave rise to the other legal acts: the
Notes and the Mortgages; Lic. Irra acknowledged that under Mexican law each of the
three acts is regulated by a different set of laws; but he rejected that the differences in
regulation imply the existence of different negotia; the differences are mainly

procedural: loans, notes, and mortgages empower the lender to use distinct court
actions to enforce its rights'®*, without creating separate transactions!™.

- Mortgages and notes require the existence of a loan that is being secured or
formalized'®; the borrower assumes a single obligation, to repay the money lent, plus
interest, and this is the only obligation that the creditor can enforce, either through the
loans, the notes or the mortgage’.

THE ZAMORA OPINIONS

Claimant retained Lic. Rodrigo Zamora Etcharren to serve as expert on Mexican law in this
arbitration. He submitted three reports on the matter!®”.

Lic. Zamora testified at the hearing and ratified the main arguments from his reports, in

particular!®*:

- There are essential differences between the Loans, the Mortgages, and the Notes,
which go beyond furnishing three procedural actions: there are three negotia that
confer different rights, include different parties, and create different procedural
actions!®.

- Each negotium is a commercial asset that confers its own set of rights: creditors have
different rights under a loan agreement, under a note and under a mortgage!””.

- The three negotia give rise to different procedural actions, which may be brought
simultaneously; a creditor can claim under the note, under the mortgage or under the
loan; this does not mean, however, that a creditor can recover the principal of the loan
three times; the principal is owed only once, and Mexican procedural law provides for
mechanisms to avoid such result!”!.

VIL. DISCUSSION

163. The Tribunal is called to decide a discrete question: whether non-negotiable promissory
notes formalizing, or mortgages securing short-term loans, can still qualify as NAFTA
protected investments under Arts. 1139(h) or 1139(g), even if the loans fail the three-year
maturity test under Art. 1139(d).

164. In their submissions, the Parties have not referred to any previous decision by any court or
tribunal deciding on this very question!””. The Tribunal is also unable to rely on the opinion
of the United States of America or Canada: although both States were entitled to submit
their opinion under Art. 1128 NAFTA, both decided not make use of such right. Nor has
the NAFTA Commission approved any binding interpretation (under Art. 1131(2) NAFTA)
shedding light on the issue.

165. In absence of any guidance, the Tribunal must apply the governing law mandated by Art.
1131(1) NAFTA: the Tribunal

“shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement [i.e. the NAFTA]
and applicable rules of international law”.

166. Applying such governing law, the Tribunal will in due course dismiss Claimant’s
submission that the Notes qualify as protected investments (1.), while finding that the
Mortgages do indeed qualify as “intangible real estate” for the purposes of Art. 1139(g)
NAFTA (2.).

1, THE NOTES DO NOT QUALIFY AS INVESTMENTS

167. Claimant’s case is that the Notes qualify as protected investments under Art. 1139(h)
NAFTA:

“(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory
of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under

(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor’s property in the territory of the
Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or

' Claimant has only drawn the attention of the Tribunal to one international law precedent where mortgages were
protected as separate investments. Many Americans had mortgages on property taken by Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav
Claims Agreement of 1948 did not include any provision concerning mortgages. Notwithstanding the above, the
Commission allowed claims for mortgages on the ground that the taking of the encumbered property effectively took
from the mortgagee the right to foreclose. Moreover, under the laws of Yugoslavia, a real property mortgage was
considered as real property — see “Foreign Claim Settlement Commission of the United States”, Decisions and
Annotations; CLA-511, p. 62; the best known decision is Erna Lina Klein, CLA-69.

(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues
or profits of an enterprise”.

In Claimant’s view, the Notes constitute “interests arising from commitment of capital”.
Lion submits that the concept of “interests”, as used in this provision, includes titles, and
the Notes qualify as titles. “Interests” also cover “cosas mercantiles”, and under Mexican
law the Notes are “cosas mercantiles” . Finally, the other requirements are also met: the
source of the Notes is Lion’s “commitment of capital” and the destination of the capital is
an “economic activity” in Mexico!”*.

Mexico disagrees. In its submission, the requirements of Art. 1139(h) are not met. Lion
made no contribution of capital under the Notes — the only contribution of capital was made
under the Loans. Notes are simply instruments which evidence the existence of a debt
created by the Loans and facilitate collection of the amounts due!”*.

The Tribunal — without hesitation — sides with Respondent.

The Notes clearly do not constitute protected investments under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA. To
support its conclusion, the Tribunal will briefly explain the nature of promissory notes under
Mexican law (A.), and then will reason why promissory notes do not meet the requirements
under Art. 1139(h) (B.).

Promissory notes under Mexican law

The three Credit Agreements entered into between Lion as Lender, and Inmobiliaria Bains
and C&C Capital as Borrowers, required that each “Credit Drawdown will be documented
in a non-negotiable Note”!’>. Complying with this contractual obligation:

- on February 28, 2007 Inmobiliaria Bains issued the First Note, undertaking to pay to
Lion US$15 million, plus interest, with final maturity date September 30, 2009!7°,

- on June 14, 2007 C&C Capital issued the Second Note in favor of Lion for US$12.45
million (plus interest), with final maturity date September 30, 2009!77; and

- on September 26, 2007 C&C Capital issued the Third Note, again in favor of Lion,
for US$5,355,479 (plus interest), with final maturity as of September 30, 2009!78,

All three Notes share several characteristics:

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

- The Notes are defined as “pagarés” subject to Mexican law;

- The Notes incorporate the issuer’s unconditional promise to pay Lion the stated
amount, plus ordinary and penalty interest;

- The Notes are expressly stated to be “no negociable[s]”;

- Payments are to be made in Lion’s designated U.S. bank account, in freely available
funds;

- The issuer submits to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Mexico’s Distrito Federal.

Under Mexican Law pagarés are a special category of titulos de crédito’. And titulos de
crédito (also known as titulos valor) are defined by the Ley General de Titulos y
Operaciones de Crédito [*LGTOC”] as'*°:

“documentos necesarios para ejercitar el derecho literal que en ellos se consigna”.

The legal definition underlines the basic trait of a titulo de crédito: a document signed by
the issuer, which grants its holder the rights literally mentioned (“incorporados”, to use the
technical expression) in the document.

Pagarés are one of the basic sub-groups of titulos de crédito: documents that formalize the
issuer’s unconditional promise to pay to the holder a certain amount of money on a certain
due date'*'. To be legally considered as a pagaré, the document must necessarily include

the word “pagaré
Pagarés are issued to formalize an underlying monetary obligation. Normally, this
obligation arises from a contract (contrato subyacente) entered into between issuer of the
pagaré and its first holder. In the present case, the contratos subyacentes are the three Credit
Agreements signed between Lion and Inmobiliaria Bains/C&C Capital. Under these
contracts the borrowers owe certain amounts of principal and interest to Lion, and these
obligations are “incorporated” into the three Notes, issued by the borrowers, designating
Lion as beneficiary, and which the borrowers delivered to Lion.

The relationship between a pagaré and its contrato subyacente can be “abstracto” or
“« 9182.
‘causal”’**;

(i) In the first case, the law, seeking to protect third parties that acquire pagarés in good
faith by endorsement, creates a separation between the underlying contract and the payment
obligation incorporated in the pagaré. If the initial holder of the note endorses the pagaré

expression fitulos valor.

to a third party (for instance, a bank), such secondary holder is entitled to request that the
issuer pay the stated amount on maturity, while the issuer is prohibited from invoking
“excepciones personales”, i.e. defenses arising from the contrato subyacente between the
issuer and the first holder'*?. A pagaré that has been endorsed and against which
excepciones personales are not admitted is said to be “abstract”.

(ii) In the second case, the link between contrato subyacente and pagaré is not severable:
the issuer may deny payment invoking the same defenses that could have been used to reject
payment under the contrato subyacente. Pagarés that have not been endorsed, and
especially pagarés which are stated to be no negociables (i.e., where endorsement is
prohibited) are always considered titulos de crédito causales'**.

Pagarés no negociables, as are the Notes issued in the present case, do not provide the
holder with an abstract right to collect. The right incorporated into the note is identical to
the right arising from the underlying contract. The main advantage conferred by a pagaré
no negociable is procedural: the holder can enforce the right against the issuer through an
accion ejecutiva, an expedited procedure that permits the preliminary attachment of the
issuer’s assets!*>.

Pagarés no negociables do not meet the requirements of Art. 1139(h

Art. 1139 NAFTA offers a sophisticated and precise definition of protected investments:
the provision lists eight categories of “interests” which are considered as investments, and
two categories which are excluded!*°.

The eight categories of interests that qualify as investment are in its turn divided into two
groups:

The first group comprises paragraphs (a) through (f) plus sub-paragraph (h.ii) of Art. 1139.
These six categories of interests all relate to situations where the foreign investor owns or
finances “enterprises” located in the host state.

The situations where the foreign investor finances an enterprise in the host state are
developed in paragraphs (c) and (d) and in sub-paragraph (h.ii):

- Paragraphs (c) and (d) cover “debt securities” bought or “loans” granted by the foreign
investor, and specifically require that the financing, if granted to an enterprise which
is not affiliated to the investor, has a maturity of at least three years;

83 See Art. 8 LGTOC; Irra I, para. 15.
‘84 Trra I, para. 28.
'85 Zamora II, para. 134.

'86 The pro

sion gives the overarching concept of “interests” to the ten categories to which it refers — see last line of

 

the definition.

47

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

Sub-paragraph (h.ii) adds a different type of financing: contracts where the investor
commits capital (or other resources), and the remuneration depends “substantially on
the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise”; provided that this requirement is
met, NAFTA does not additionally require a minimum three-year maturity.

186. The s
paragraph (h.i). These provisions cover two distinct situations:

econd group of protected investments are those defined in paragraph (g) and sub-

Paragraph (g) refers to “real estate or other property, tangible or intangible”, acquired
or used by the foreign investor for economic benefit or for business purposes; while

Sub-paragraph (h.i) extends the concept of investments to contracts in which the
investor commits capital (or other resources) to economic activity in the host state,
“including turnkey or construction contracts or concessions”.

a. The Tribunal’s decision

187. The b:

188. In the

asic facts of the case are not in dispute:

The lender of the financing was Lion, a Canadian company;

The Borrowers were two unaffiliated enterprises located in Mexico;
The maturity was less than three years;

The contract was formalized in three Credit Agreements;

The Borrowers’ repayment obligations were additionally formalized in three non-
negotiable pagarés;

The remuneration for the Loans and the pagarés was a fixed-interest rate, without any
link to the revenues or profits of the Borrowers.

Tribunal’s opinion, Lion’s interest deriving from these financings — be it the Credit

Agreements or the Notes — does not meet the requirements to be considered as a protected
investment under any of the categories defined in Art. 1139 NAFTA:

189. (i) Art. 1139(d) NAFTA'*”:

but does not include a loan, regardless of original maturity, to a state enterprise”.

The Credit Agreements do not meet the requirements under Art. 1139(d).

Whilst it is true that the Credit Agreements qualify as “loans” to an unaffiliated enterprise,
as Claimant itself acknowledges, the Loans by themselves cannot constitute protected
investments, because they do not pass the three-year maturity test required by Art.
1139(d)(ii).

(ii) Art. 1139(c) NAFTA!*8:
“(c) a debt security of an enterprise
(i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or
(ii) where the original maturity of the debt security is at least three years,

but does not include a debt security, regardless of original maturity, of a state
enterprise”.

The Notes fail to qualify as “debt security” under Art. 1139(c).

The Tribunal shares the Claimant’s opinion that pagarés no negociables do not fit within
the definition of “debt security” set forth in paragraph (c)!*?: debt securities are tradeable,
while endorsement of pagarés no negociables is prohibited by law.

Be that as it may, even if it were accepted that the pagarés no negociables can be considered
as “debt securities”, the Notes would not qualify: having been issued by an unaffiliated
enterprise, they must pass, but fail, the three-year-maturity threshold.

(iii) Art. 1139(h.i) and (h.ii) NAFTA!”:

“(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory
of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under

Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or

(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues
or profits of an enterprise”.

'®! Claimant’s Counter-Memori

192

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

 

Sub-paragraph (h.i) only covers contracts involving “the presence of an investor’s property
in the territory” of the host state; and to clarify its meaning, the provision provides three
examples (turnkey contracts, construction contracts and concessions). This category bears
no relationship with the case under discussion: pagarés no negociables, where the
underlying contract is a loan, do not imply the presence of an investor’s property in the host
state, and have no relationship with turnkey contracts, construction contracts, and
concessions.

Sub-paragraph (h.ii) also fails to grant protection to the Notes. It refers to contracts where
the investor commits capital, provided that the remuneration depends substantially on the
production, revenues or profits of an enterprise located in the host state — a requirement
which the fixed-interest Notes do not satisfy.

b. Claimant’s counter-arguments

Claimant argues that the Notes are protected, by referring simply to the chapeau of
paragraph (h), and excluding any reference to the examples provided in sub-paragraphs (i)
and (ii). In Claimant’s submission, the Notes qualify as “interests arising from the
commitment of capital [...] to economic activity” and consequently are protected'?!.

The argument is unconvincing — as Mexico has correctly argued!°”.

In the present case, Lion formalized the commitment of capital contractually — by signing
the Credit Agreements. Additionally, Claimant requested and obtained pagarés no
negociables issued by the Borrowers. The delivery of this causal (i.e., non-abstract) titulo
de crédito, intrinsically bound to the Credit Agreement, does not change the nature or the
scope of the legal relationship between Lender and Borrowers: their legal relationship
continues to be governed by the Credit Agreements, and — for the purposes of Art. 1139
NAFTA - such legal relationship continues to be a “loan” subject to paragraph (d); a loan
which does not meet the three-year maturity test. Contrary to Claimant’s view, the delivery
of this titulo de crédito does not constitute a separate and severable commitment of capital.

Claimant puts the focus of its analysis on the chapeau of paragraph (h) and submits that any
“interests arising from the commitment of capital” are protected.

This is not so.

The chapeau cannot be read by itself. The NAFTA does not extend protection to any
“commitments of capital”, but only to those which exhibit certain features so as to give rise
to “interests”. These features are defined through two illustrative examples in sub-
paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii). Both sub-paragraphs share a common feature: both refer to
“contracts”. Thus, it is safe to conclude that a minimum requirement of “commitments of

capital” protected by paragraph (h) is to be formalized as contracts. The pagarés no
negociables do not meet this test: they are titulos de crédito, not contracts.

There is a further argument.

The contracts that underlie the pagarés no negociables — short-term, fixed-interest loans —
do not share any traits with the contracts described in sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii), which
serve as illustrative examples of protected “commitments of capital”. Sub-paragraph (h.i)
covers construction contracts and concessions, and sub-paragraph (h.ii) contracts with
variable remuneration. The ordinary meaning of a term in a treaty must be read in its context,
as Art. 31.1 VCLT mandates. And in this case the context provided by sub-paragraphs (h.i)
and (h.ii) shows that “commitments of capital” to be protected under paragraph (h) must
show some additional, defining feature, which simple short-term fixed-interest loans lack.
Loans are specifically governed by Art. 1139(d) NAFTA — and only protected provided that
the requirements set forth in that provision are met.

THE MORTGAGES QUALIFY AS INVES TS

Having concluded that the Credit Agreements and the Notes do not qualify as NAFTA
protected investments, the Tribunal must now address Claimant’s final argument: that the
Mortgages qualify as “intangible real estate or other property” acquired by Lion “for the
purpose of economic benefit” under paragraph (g) of Art. 1139.

Claimant maintains that under Mexican law mortgages are considered “real estate” and
under international law, as “other property”!”?.

Claimant does not dispute that mortgages are accessory transactions, which secure rights
deriving from the Loans, but considers that the three-year minimum maturity required by
paragraphs (c) and (d) is inapposite'*+, because the Loans and the Mortgages are separate
negotia, with different objects, different parties, and separate legal regimes. Mortgages are
rights in rem, effective erga omnes, allow the creditor to follow the asset even if owned by
a third party, and the value of the mortgage differs from the value of the loan: it is unaffected
by the debtor’s solvency and will remain equal to the value of the asset!®°.

Mexico disagrees. It says that mortgages are accessory, and that the only economically
relevant transaction was the granting of three short-term loans that did not qualify as an
investment. Claimant did not invest in mortgages. The definition of “loans” in paragraph
(d) includes loans secured by mortgages. Since the Loans in the present case have a maturity

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

Mexico adds that the mortgage is a security right created over real property, and the real
estate is never delivered to nor owned by the creditor; the only right conferred by the
mortgage is a preferential right to get paid from the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged
property, and this does not amount to “real estate or other property” under paragraph (g)!°’.

Finally, Mexico argues that if the Mortgages are considered separately, that would allow
protection of any loans — regardless of their original maturity — by just adding a security.
This was not the intention of NAFTA signatories!”*.

The Tribunal will analyze the nature of mortgages under Mexican law (1.), and then will
reason why the Mortgages in the present case constitute protected investments under Art.
1139(g) NAFTA, without such protection extending to the Loans or the Notes (2.).

MORTGAGES UNDER MEXICAN LAW
Lion obtained three mortgages as a security for the Loans:

- On June 13, 2007 Bansi S.A., as trustee, and as per the instruction of C&C Capital, as
founder and beneficiary of the trust, granted in favor of Lion the Guadalajara
Mortgage 1, which encumbered certain properties of the Guadalajara Project, and
secured the principal and interest owed under the Second Loan!””;

- On September 26, 2007, Bansi S.A, again acting as trustee, as per the instruction of
C&C Capital, granted in favor of Lion the Guadalajara Mortgage 2, which
encumbered certain properties of the Guadalajara Project”®’, and secured the principal
and interest owed under the Third Loan;

- On April 2, 2008 Inmobiliaria Bains granted the Nayarit Mortgage over the Nayarit
Project, located in Bahia de Banderas, securing the three Loans, including principal
and interest”°!.

Under Mexican law, mortgages are regulated by the Civil Code of the states where the real
estate is located, regardless of the nature of the obligation which is being secured. In the
present case, the Guadalajara Mortgages | and 2 are subject to the Civil Code of Jalisco
[“CC Jalisco”], and the Nayarit Mortgage to the Civil Code of Nayarit (“CC Nayarit”.

“Articulo 2517.- Es contrato de hipoteca aquél por virtud del cual se constituye un
derecho real sobre bienes inmuebles o derechos reales que no se entreguen al
acreedor, para garantizar el cumplimiento de una obligacion y su grado de preferencia
en el pago”*™.

“Articulo 2264.- La hipoteca es una garantia real constituida sobre bienes que no se
entregan al acreedor, y que da derecho a éste, en caso de incumplimiento de la
obligacion garantizada, a ser pagado con el valor de los bienes, en el grado de
preferencia establecido por la Ley’”®.

Mortgages are defined as derechos reales that encumber real estate (or other derechos
reales), affording the mortgagee the right, if the guaranteed obligation is breached, to be
paid with the price resulting from the sale in public auction of the asset. The encumbrance
follows the asset: if the mortgagor transfers the asset to a third party, the beneficiary’s rights
over the real estate remain unaffected”.

Mortgages do not imply that the mortgagee acquires the possession or ownership over the
asset. The mortgagee does not enjoy the full set of traditional rights granted to the owner of
real estate (ius utendi, ius fruendi, ius abutendi), but only aright of preference: if the secured
obligation is not paid, the mortgagee can force the sale of the asset, and the price obtained
is used to satisfy the secured obligation?’ — provided that the mortgage has been
documented in a notarial deed and registered in the Public Registry””*.

As derechos reales de garantia, mortgages always secure an underlying obligation, where
the mortgagee is the creditor and the mortgagor, the debtor (or a third party willing to
provide a guarantee). Although mortgage and underlying obligation are separate negocios
juridicos, created by declarations of intent of different persons, and formalized in separate
documents, mortgages are said to be “accessory”. Accessoriness implies that payment or
voidness of the underlying obligation provokes the extinction of the mortgage — but not that
both legal relationships are identical*!”.

The value of the mortgage and that of the underlying obligation also do not have to coincide,
neither at the time of creation or thereafter: the value of the main obligation fluctuates with

the solvency of the debtor, while the value of the mortgage depends on the worth of the
mortgaged real estate (and the legal preference granted to mortgages)”"!.

Mortgages are bienes inmuebles

The CCs of Jalisco and of Nayarit distinguish between “bienes inmuebles” and “bienes
muebles”.

Under Art. 799 CC Jalisco and Art. 738 CC Nayarit, the definition of “bienes inmuebles”
extends not only to tangible assets but also to certain intangible rights:

- Tangible real estate is labelled as “inmuebles por naturaleza”, and is defined by the
fact that such assets “no pueden trasladarse de un lugar a otro”;

- But both CCs, following a long tradition, also extend the concept of bienes inmuebles
to certain intangible rights over real estate (the so-called “bienes inmuebles
intangibles o incorporales’).

Picking up on this tradition, Art. 799 XII CC Jalisco and Art. 738 XII CC Nayarit provide
that “los derechos reales sobre inmuebles” are also to be considered as bienes inmuebles.
The derechos reales sobre inmuebles are certain defined categories of rights in rem,
including but not limited to mortgages?".

The necessary corollary is that, under the relevant municipal law, the Mortgages constitute
bienes inmuebles (and more specifically bienes inmuebles incorporales o intangibles).

MORTGAGES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF ART. 1139(G)

Under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA, protected investments include (inter alia) “intangible real
estate”, provided that the investor uses the asset for “economic benefit or other business
purpose”.

Claimant says that the definition of “intangible real estate” must be established applying the
lex situs, in this case the CCs Jalisco and Nayarit, and that under such rules mortgages
indeed qualify as intangible real estate. Lion adds that the second requirement is also met:
the Mortgages were granted for economic benefit.

The Tribunal concurs. It will first explain its reasoning (A.), and then will analyze Mexico’s
counter-arguments (B.)

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Tribunal’s reasoning

Under Art. 1139(g) NAFTA an asset, to be considered as a protected investment, must meet
two requirements: it must constitute “intangible real estate” and it must be used for
economic benefit or other business purpose.

The Mortgages satisfy both requirements.

(i) NAFTA does not offer a definition of the term “intangible real estate” used in its Art.
1139(g). Absent such definition, to determine whether an investor holds “intangible real
estate”, it is necessary to refer to the law of the host state. As the tribunal stated in Emmis”:

“Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain
protections to property rights created according to municipal law”.

The municipal law in this case are the legal systems of the Mexican states of Nayarit and
Jalisco, since the encumbered real estate is located in these jurisdictions and both legal
systems embrace the /ex loci rei sitae principle:

“Articulo 14.- Los bienes inmuebles ubicados en el Estado y los bienes muebles que en
él se encuentren, se regiran por las disposiciones de este Codigo”*"".

“Articulo 15.- La determinacién del derecho aplicable se hard conforme a las
siguientes reglas: .. .

V. Los bienes inmuebles ubicados en el Estado de Jalisco y los bienes muebles que en
él se encuentren, se regirdn por las disposiciones de este Cédigo”*'.

Applying the CCs of Nayarit and Jalisco, the Tribunal has already concluded that both civil
law systems explicitly and unequivocally include mortgages within the legal category of
derechos reales, which in their turn constitute bienes inmuebles, and more specifically
bienes inmuebles intangibles or intangible real estate.

The Mortgages thus constitute intangible real estate, and meet the first requirement under
Art. 1139(g) NAFTA.

There is a small discrepancy between the terminology used in the Civil Codes of Nayarit
and Jalisco, and the one used in the Spanish version of the NAFTA: while the Civil Codes
refer to bienes inmuebles, the Spanish version of the NAFTA refers to bienes raices. Both
expressions are synonyms in Spanish?!°. The same conclusion, that there is no difference
between bienes inmuebles and bienes raices, is reached by comparing the terminology used

in the three equally authentic texts of the Treaty?'’: the French text uses the expression
“biens immobiliers” as equivalent to “real estate” in English and “bienes raices” in Spanish.

(ii) The second requirement established by Art. 1139(g) is also met: Lion acquired the
Mortgages for economic benefit and with a business purpose. Lion is an investment
company, and the purpose of the Mortgages was to secure commercial loans, granted to two
Mexican enterprises, with the purpose of earning interest (and eventually to invest in certain
real estate projects situated in Mexico).

For these reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that the ordinary meaning of “real estate or other
property, tangible or intangible” in Art. 1139(g) includes the Mortgages.

Consistent treaty practice

The conclusion that the Mortgages constitute protected investments is confirmed by
Mexico’s treaty practice. Investment treaties signed by Mexico frequently include derechos
reales as a category of protected investments, and refer to mortgages as specific derechos
reales which are contained within the scope of protection.

The treaty practice starts with Mexico’s proprietary Model of Investment Promotion and
Protection Agreement, which in its Art. 2 provides a list of investments, and specifically
extends protection to “any other right in rem, such as mortgages” ?'*:

“[...] immovable property, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of
economic benefit or business purposes, as well as any other right in rem, such as
mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights”.

There are at least 22 BITs signed by Mexico, which follow the same structure, and confirm
that in Mexico’s understanding hipotecas (mortgages) fall within the category of bienes
inmuebles intangibles”. The first was the BIT between Mexico and Spain, executed back
in 1995, whose Art. 1 (4) (e) extended protection to

“la propiedad de bienes muebles o inmuebles, asi como hipotecas, derechos de prenda,
usufructos u otra propiedad tangible o intangible [...] adquiridos para actividades
econoémicas u otros fines empresariales”.

The language of the Treaty shows that, in Mexico’s understanding, hipotecas form part of
the general category of “propiedad intangible” and, more specifically, of “propiedad
intangible de bienes inmuebles”.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

There are good reasons why mortgages should constitute a category of protected investment
of their own. Mortgages are also inextricably linked with the piece of real estate that they
burden. And the value of this right in rem can be affected by measures adopted by the host
state, targeted at such piece of real estate (e.g., expropriation) or specifically at the mortgage
(e.g., dilution of preference). The purpose of treaties, when they include mortgages among
the protected assets, is to extend the scope of protection to this type of situations.

Summing up: the Mortgages — i.e. the derechos reales de garantia — granted to Lion, meet
the two conditions required by Art. 1139(g) to qualify as investments protected by the

Mexico’s counter-arguments considered
Mexico raises several counter-arguments.

First, Mexico says that Claimant did not invest in mortgages; the only economically relevant
transaction was the granting of three short-term Loans’. The Mortgages in this case are
accessory to and form an integral part of the Loans, and the definition of “loans” in
paragraph (d) including loans secured by mortgages. Since the Loans have a maturity date
of less than three years, they do not constitute investments”!

The Tribunal is not convinced.

Lion provided funds to Inmobiliaria Bains/C&C Capital, and in exchange obtained two sets
of rights:

- personal rights against the borrowers deriving from the Credit Agreements (and the
Notes), plus

- rights in rem (derechos reales) over certain real estate assets located in Jalisco and
Nayarit.

Art. 1139 NAFTA does not define “investment” as an abstract notion. It simply states that
“investment means” one of eight categories of assets or “interests”, each defined in a
separate paragraph, and each subject to specific requirements. The technique followed by
Art. 1139 has an important implication: to be considered as a protected investment, an asset
or interest must meet the requirements of one of the eight categories. If an investor holds
several interests, and all qualify under different paragraphs of Art. 1139, each interest will
be protected. And if some of these interests meet the requirements, and others do not, those
compliant will still enjoy protection: an investor cannot be denied protection for compliant
interests simply because he or she also holds non-compliant assets.

Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

 

In the present case, Lion holds three interests that fall into two categories:

- Credit Agreements and Notes: these interests are not protected, because the Notes do
not fall under paragraph (h) (as already explained) and under paragraph (d) loans to
unaffiliated borrowers require a minimum maturity of three years — a condition which
is not met;

- Mortgages: in accordance with municipal law, mortgages constitute “intangible real
estate”; under paragraph (g), “intangible real estate” is protected, provided that the
asset was acquired for economic benefit or business purposes — a requirement that
Lion does comply with.

Art. 1139 NAFTA does not provide that an investor holding distinct interests, some of which
individually qualify as a protected investment while others fail, should be denied protection,
simply because one or more assets fail the test. Consequently, the Tribunal sees no reason
to deny protection to the Mortgages under paragraph (g), simply because its Credit
Agreements and Notes fall short of the standards under paragraphs (d) and (h).

Mexico has tried to circumvent this conclusion, arguing that the Mortgages are ancillary
transactions, and that Loans and Mortgages must be considered as one and the same
transaction.

Contrary to Mexico’s submission, the Mortgages, albeit ancillary, are not and never were
integral parts of the Loans. Loans and Mortgages resulted from separate declarations of
consent, made by different persons, at different times, and in different documents:

- The Loans were formalized in the Credit Agreements, the contracts in which Lion
consented to lend and the Borrowers undertook to repay principal and interest; while

- The Mortgages were created thereafter, in three separate notarial deeds, in which the
mortgagors unilaterally consented to the encumbrance of their property as a security
for the Loans.

From an economics point of view, there is also no identity between Loans and Mortgages:
the value of the Loans is the dependent on the borrowers’ solvency and capacity to pay,
while the value of the Mortgages hinges on the price which the encumbered real estate will
attain in a public auction and on the legal preference afforded to the mortgagee.

Second, Mexico adds that a mortgage is a security right created in real property that is never
delivered to or owned by the creditor; the mortgage only confers a preferential right to the
proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property. Mexico concludes that mortgages are not
“real estate or other property” under paragraph (g)?”.

Lion Mexico Consolidated v. Mexico
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2
Decision on Jurisdiction

The Tribunal concurs with Mexico that mortgages are indeed security rights in real estate,
and that possession of the asset does not pass to the mortgagee. But Mexico’s suggested
consequence is a non sequitur.

As the Tribunal has already explained, under municipal law mortgages are considered
derechos reales, which by law constitute bienes inmuebles intangibles, and Art. 1139(g)
expressly extends protection to this category of assets. The ordinary meaning of “intangible
real estate” in paragraph (g), which the Tribunal has established by applying Mexico’s own
municipal law, does not support, but rather contradicts, Mexico’s argument that mortgages
are to be excluded.

Finally, Mexico argues that if the Mortgages are considered separately, that would allow
protection of any loan (regardless of its maturity) by just adding a security —a result said to
be contrary to the intention of the NAFTA signatories’.

Mexico’s counter-argument is based on a misconception: the Respondent assumes that, if
the mortgage constitutes a protected investment, the protection is automatically extended to
the loan. This is not so.

Loan and mortgage constitute separate categories of interests, with separate sets of
requirements to become protected investments. This implies that in certain situations the
mortgage may constitute a protected investment, while the underlying loan will not. In those
cases, the Treaty protection afforded to the mortgage is not extended to the loan. The scope
of protection which the investor enjoys, will depend on the measures adopted by the host
state in breach of the Treaty. If such measures affect the mortgage or the encumbered real
estate asset, the investor will be entitled to invoke NAFTA protection. If the measures target
the loan, no such protection will be forthcoming. To provide a simple example: an investor
holding a mortgage, which secures an underlying loan that does not meet the three-year
maturity requirement, is protected against an improper expropriation of the real estate,
which destroys the value of the mortgage”! — but not for a measure which specifically
targets the transfer of funds deriving from loans.

CONCLUSION

In its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Lion asked the Tribunal for the following relief?”°:

“140. For the reasons discussed above, the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral
Tribunal to issue a decision on jurisdiction rejecting Mexico’s Jurisdictional Objection
