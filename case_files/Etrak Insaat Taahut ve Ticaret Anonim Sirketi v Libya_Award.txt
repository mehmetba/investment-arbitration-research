On 19 January 2017 Prof. Dr. Kaj Hobér was confirmed as president of the
Arbitral Tribunal by the ICC Secretary General, upon joint nomination by the co-
arbitrators. Prof. Dr. Hobér’s address is Saves vag 36, 75263 Uppsala, Sweden.

Pursuant to Article 16 of the Rules the file was transmitted to the Arbitral Tribunal
on January 20, 2017.

In emails from the Claimant on 9 February 2017, and from the Respondent on 20
February 2017, the Parties agreed to the appointment of Mr. Joel Dahlquist
Cullborg as administrative secretary to the Arbitral Tribunal, in conformity with the
section on Administrative Secretaries of the Note to Parties and Arbitral Tribunals
on the Conduct of the Arbitration under the ICC Rules of Arbitration.

As required by Article 24 of the Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal convened a case
management conference, which took place via telephone conference on
February 27, 2017 for the purpose of consulting with the Parties on procedural
measures to be adopted pursuant to Article 22(2) of the Rules and Appendix IV
to the Rules.

On 21 March 2017, the Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal established the Terms of
Reference.

On 15 May 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which
further to the Terms of Reference contained instructions on the conduct of the
proceedings, including the procedural timetable.

On 5 June 2017, Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim.

On 9 October 2017 Claimant submitted a Request for Interim Measures. The
Request for Interim Measures was amended on 10 October 2017.

On 13 October 2017, Respondent requested an extension for filing its Statement
of Defence. According to the original timetable incorporated in Procedural Order
No. 1, the Statement of Defence was due to be filed on 16 October 2017.
Respondent asked that this deadline be extended to 11 December 2017. In its
Procedural Order No. 2, on 16 October 2017 the Arbitral Tribunal extended the
deadline for the Statement of Defence to 13 November 2017. As a consequence
of this extension, all other submission deadlines in the original procedural
timetable were pushed back four weeks.

After receiving the Parties’ submissions on the issue of interim measures, on 9
November 2017 the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, in which it
denied the Claimant’s Request for Interim Measures, while reserving its decisions
on costs in connection with the Request to a later stage of the arbitration.

On 13 November 2017, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence (“the
Statement of Defence”).

As per the updated procedural timetable in Procedural Order No, 2, on 3 January
2018 the Parties exchanged comments on the other side’s request for document
production.

On 1 February 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal decided on the contested aspects of
both Parties’ requests for production of documents.

On 8 March 2018, Claimant wrote an email to the Arbitral Tribunal, in which it
claimed that Respondent had not produced a letter, together with attached
minutes from a meeting (“the Document(s)”), dated 18 June 2013 and sent from
the National Head of the State Litigation Department to the Derna Branch Head
of the State Litigation Department. Respondent's stated reason for not producing
the Document(s) was that they “include[] advice and concerns the conduct of
litigation and accordingly Respondent claims privilege over both documents”. On
the Arbitral Tribunal’s invitation, Respondent developed its reasons for the
invoked privilege on 19 March 2018. Also on the Arbitral Tribunal’s invitation,
Claimant commented on Respondent's developed reasons on 23 March 2018.
On 27 March 2018, the Tribunal rejected Claimant’s request for the production of
the Document(s).

On 21 May 2018, Claimant submitted its Reply to Respondent's Statement of
Defence (“the Reply”.)

On 16 August 2018, Claimant wrote to the Arbitral Tribunal with a further Request
for Document Production. According to Claimant, it had been informed by
Respondent on 13 August 2018 of new circumstances in the pending court
proceedings in which Respondent requests a declaration on the validity and effect
of the Settlement Agreement under Libyan law (“the Tripoli Proceedings’).
Claimant asked the Arbitral Tribunal to order Respondent to produce:

e Any document in connection with or relating to the alleged notification to
Claimant of the Tripoli Proceedings and a 18 October 2018 hearing in
those proceedings; and

e A full and complete copy of the case file in respect of the Tripoli
Proceedings, including any document in connection with the alleged
Notification of the statement of claim, a full set of all pleadings, any
documents issued by the court, as well as any document with respect to
the taking of any procedural steps in the proceedings.

On 20 August 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal noted that Claimant had received the
relevant documents from Respondent, pre-empting any need for an Arbitral
Tribunal order, and that Claimant reserved its right to request leave to make brief
written submissions concerning the Tripoli Proceedings, after receiving
Respondent’s Statement of Rejoinderon 17 September 2018, and before the
Hearing.

On 20 September 2018, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Rejoinder
(‘the Rejoinder”’).

The Hearing was held from 15 October through 18 October 2018 in London.

On 26 November 2018, the Parties submitted their statements on costs. On 13
December 2018, the Parties submitted their comments on the other Party’s
statement on costs.

On 15 January 2019, the Arbitral Tribunal declared the proceedings closed. On
that same date, the Arbitral Tribunal requested the ICC Court to extend the time
limit for the submission of the draft Final Award until 31 May 2019. On 31 January
2019, the ICC Court extended the time limit until 31 May 2019. On 23 May 2019
the time limit was further extended until 28 June 2019. On 26 June 2019, the ICC
Court extended the time limit for rendering the final award until 31 July 2019.

PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

Claimant has requested that the Arbitral Tribunal:*

. Find and declare that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over all claims brought

by Claimant;

. Find and declare that Respondent has violated its obligations under the BIT and

customary international law as a result of non-compliance with the Settlement
Agreement;

. Alternatively, find and declare that Respondent has violated its specific
obligations contained in the Settlement Agreement, and thus the umbrella
clause obligation under the BIT by virtue of the MFN clause thereof;

. Alternatively, find and declare, as a matter of contract, that Respondent has
violated its obligations contained in the Settlement Agreement itself;

Award compensation of no less than USD 20,080,549.71 as a result of
Respondent's non-performance of the Settlement Agreement per se in line with

the finding and declaration of violations as per “A” or “B” or “C” above;

Award moral damages to Claimant in an amount no less than USD 3,000,000;

G. Award Claimant interest calculated from 29 August 2016 at a rate to be
compounded and fixed by the Arbitral Tribunal. Claimant requests interest at an
annual interest rate of 4% calculated on a simple basis in case the Arbitral
Tribunal finds that Respondent has breached the Settlement Agreement as a
matter of contract, or alternatively an interest rate of LIBOR plus 5%,
compounded semi-annually, in case the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent
has breached the BIT;

H. Award Claimant all costs and fees incurred in connection with this Arbitration;

|. Award Claimant any other relief to which it may be entitled in law or equity.

34. Respondent has requested that the Arbitral Tribunal:

A. Dismiss Claimant's claims for lack of jurisdiction, on the following grounds:

|. The Turkey-Libya BIT has never entered into force, because Turkey
never notified Libya of the completion of the requisite constitutional
formalities in Turkey for its entry into force.

Il. Claimant has not shown that it holds any qualifying “investment” within
Libya for the purposes of Article 1(2) of the Turkey-Libya BIT.

Ill. Even if Claimant had made a qualifying investment within Libya, the
dispute in issue between Claimant and Libya would be outside the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal because it arose before the Turkey-Libya BIT
entered into force.

IV. Claimant chose to submit the dispute to the Libyan courts and cannot
now bring claims arising from the same dispute in this arbitration,
pursuant to Articles 8(2) and 8(3) of the Turkey-Libya BIT. The Libyan
court proceedings are still ongoing and have not yet resulted in a final
decision.

V. By entering into the Turkey-Libya BIT, Respondent has not consented to
the referral to arbitration of Claimant's claims which are entirely
contractual in nature.

B. In the event that the Arbitral Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction to consider
Claimant’s claims, dismiss those claims on the merits; and

C. Award Respondent all of its costs incurred in connection with this arbitration,
including its attorney's fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of the
Arbitral Tribunal and the ICC.

Vv. BACKGROUND

35. Below follows a summary of the facts of the dispute, based on the submissions
made by the Parties in this Arbitration. Further details of the Parties’ submissions
are set out in Sections VI, VII and VIII below, which deal with the Parties’ positions
on matters of jurisdiction, liability and quantum respectively.

36. Claimant is a Turkish construction company, which has been active in Libya since
1980. According to Claimant, it has concluded more than 35 public works projects
under approximately 20 contracts with various Libyan authorities.? In the early
1990s, Claimant ceased work in Libya. According to Claimant, the reason for this
cessation of activities was that its invoices were not paid by its counterparts.?
Respondent asserts, however, that the contracts were terminated by mutual
consent. Respondent makes no admissions as to the performance of the
contracts prior to their termination.‘ In any event, Claimant states that it was never
paid fully for its works, and that it tried to recover payment of the alleged debts
during the next two decades.

37. In July 1994, Claimant's unpaid invoices were tabulated.5 From 1994, Claimant
began a process of collating various documents showing the alleged outstanding
debts. These documents were submitted to the Libyan Treasury under the
framework of a protocol between the governments of Turkey and Libya in
December 1994, which concerned numerous unpaid debts owed by Libya to
different Turkish companies.®

38. Claimant describes this work as long, continuous and arduous, and it was only
completed in 2005.” In 2007 and 2008, Claimant participated in an audit
performed by a committee for the Audit and Review of Gutstanding Liabilities of
Libya’s Treasury (“the Audit Committee”). On 21 December 2008, the audit was
completed, determining that Libya owed Claimant LD 1,721,389.823. According
to Respondent, the Audit Committee’s findings were not final, which Respondent
asserts that Claimant recognized at the time.®

 
   
 
 
 
 
   
   
  

39. From 2009 to 2011 Claimant attempted unsuccessfully to collect the amount
identified by the Audit Committee. Ultimately, Claimant initiated court
proceedings in order to recover its alleged debt. On 27 September 2012,
Claimant filed a claim before the Beida Court of First Instance against the Prime

Minister of the Transitional Interim Government, the President of the General
National Congress, the Minister of Finance, and the Governor of the Libyan
Central Bank. On 29 October 2012, the Beida Court of First Instance found that
Respondent was to pay Claimant for receivables dating back to 1991, amounting
to LD 1.906.360.23 plus interest at the rate of 7.5% running from 18 January
1991, as well as LD 1.000.000 to cover losses incurred in trying to collect the
outstanding payment “(“the Court Decision’).

No representatives of Libyan authorities appeared to contest the claims before
the Beida Court of First Instance.? According to Respondent, the Libyan entities
named as respondents in the Beida Court of First Instance case were not notified
of the proceedings by Claimant, who under Libyan law had the legal obligation to
notify the other party.’° The State Litigation Department only became aware of
the Court Decision in January 2013."

On 9 December 2013 a Settlement Agreement (“the Settlement Agreement) was
signed by representatives of Claimant and Mr. Ghaith Suleiman, Deputy Minister
in the Libyan Ministry of Finance.’ Under the Settlement Agreement, Claimant
was to receive payments totaling LD 5,420,308.707 in installments to be paid at
two separate dates in 2014.15 The Settlement Agreement also included an
agreement that both parties abandon any domestic or international proceedings
regarding the Court Decision. "4

Respondent disputes that the Settlement Agreement is valid,‘* and does not
accept Claimant’s evidence as to the negotiation and signing of the Settlement
Agreement."® As developed below at para. 47, Respondent has initiated court
proceedings in Tripoli to nullify the Settlement Agreement. To date, Claimant has
not received any payments under the Settlement Agreement.”

The Court Decision was orally appealed on 23 January 2013 (“the Appeal”), and
on 31 January 2018, the Beida Court of Appeal issued the Appeal Decision, which
overturned the Court Decision.'® The Parties are not in agreement as to what
transpired between January 2013, when the Appeal was lodged, and January
2018, when the Appeal Decision was issued.

According to Respondent, the Appeal was transferred to the Green Mountain
Court of Appeal in Derna on 17 April 2013. However, the worsening security
situation in the region forced the Green Mountain Court of Appeal to close in June
2013 amidst violence and due to the assassination of a judge.'° The Appeal was

thereafter transferred to the newly established Beida Court of Appeal, which
began hearing cases in late 2015.2° Given the backlog of pending cases, the
Appeal was recorded by Beida Court Appeal on 1 March 2017. In Respondent's
19 January 2017 Answer in the present Arbitration, Respondent explained that
the Appeal was still ongoing at that time, but subject to delays.27 Respondent
asserts that Claimant has been given every chance to participate in the Appeal
proceedings, but has elected not to do so.74

45. In Claimant’s view, Respondent's version of the facts concerning the Appeal are
beset by “controversies and inconsistencies”.?> Following the Settlement
Agreement, Claimant had assumed that the Appeal had been withdrawn. It claims
to have learned about the Appeal’s existence only via a 13 September 2017 letter
submitted by Respondent's counsel in the present Arbitration.24 Claimant views
the Appeal as inactive for more than four years, and then “reactivated” by
Respondent. The Appeal Decision provides that the Court of Appeal regarded the
Appeal as filed on 28 September 2017, i.e. after Respondent's 13 September
2017 letter informing Claimant about the Appeal.25 Even assuming that the
Appeal was recorded on 1 March 2017, Claimant points out, this date is around
40 days after the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence, in which it
referred to the Appeal ambiguously.7°

46. There was a procedural hearing in the Appeal on 3 October 2017, followed by a
substantive hearing on 15 November, 2017. Claimant was not present at either
of these hearings.?” The Parties dispute whether Claimant was properly notified
of the hearings.?®

47. Claimant views Respondent's pursuit of the Appeal as a violation of the
Settlement Agreement.?? In between the two hearings in the Appeal, Claimant
filed its Request for Interim Measures, asking the Tribunal to order Respondent
to suspend or request a stay of the Appeal, which the Tribunal rejected in
Procedural Order No. 3 on 9 November 2017.

 

 
 
   
   

48. By contrast, Respondent asserts that the Appeal Decision is the result of well-
founded objections against the Court Decision.*° The Appeal was based on
criticisms against the Court Decision, concerning (i) the lack of proper service on
the respondents; (ii) the lack of jurisdiction of the Beida Court of First Instance;
and (iii) the effect of the Audit Committee process.*' Claimant asserts that the

basis for the Appeal Decision is “fundamentally wrong”,*? and amounts to a denial
of justice in violation of the BIT.°*

On 25 March 2018, the State Litigation Department, on behalf of the Prime
Minister and Governor of the Central Bank of Libya initiated the Tripoli
Proceedings at the Northern Tripoli Court of First Instance, with the aim of
declaring the Settlement Agreement null and void.*4 Respondents in the Tripoli
Proceedings are, in addition to Claimant, the Undersecretary of Finance and the
Minister of Finance.°> The declaration is sought on three grounds: (i) the
Settlement Agreement was concluded by an individual without the requisite legal
authority; (ii) mandatory procedures for entering into a binding settlement
agreement by a government authority were not satisfied; and (iii) the Appeal
Decision, which overturned the Court Decision, has made performance of the
Settlement Agreement legally impossible.

JURISDICTION

Claimant has raised claims under the arbitration clause set forth in Article 8
of the Turkey-Libya BIT, dated November 25, 2009 (“the BIT”). Article 8
reads:

ARTICLE 8

Settlement of Disputes Between One Contracting Party end Investors
of the Other Contracting Party

1. Disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the
other Contracting Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified
in writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the recipient
Contracting Party of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the
concerned Contracting Party shall endeavor to settle these disputes by
consultations and negotiations in good faith.

2. If these disputes, cannot be settled in this way within ninety (90) days
following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the
dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to the competent
court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been
made or to international arbitration under:

(a) the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
set up by the "Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between
States and Nationals of other States", in case both Contracting Parties
become signatories of this Convention,

(b) an ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of
Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL).

(c) the Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce.

3. Once the investor has submitted the dispute to the one of the dispute
settlement procedures mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article, the choice
of one of these procedures is final.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article;

(a) only the disputes arising directly out of investment activities which have
obtained necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant
legislation of both Contracting Parties on foreign capital, and that effectively
started shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in case both Contracting Parties
become signatories of this Convention, or any other international dispute
settlement mechanism as agreed upon by the Contracting Parties;

(b) the disputes, related to the property and real rights upon the real estates
are totally under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory
the investment is made, therefore shall not be submitted to jurisdiction of
the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or
any other international dispute settlement mechanism; and

(c) With regard to the Article 64 of the "Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States";

The Republic of Turkey shall not accept the referral of any disputes arising
between the Republic of Turkey and any other Contracting State concerning
the interpretation or application of "Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States", which
is not settled by negotiation, to the International Court of Justice.

5. The arbitration awards shall be final and binding for all parties in dispute.
Each Contracting Party commits itself to execute the award according to its
national law.

51. Respondent has raised several jurisdictional objections:

a) The Turkey-Libya BIT has never entered into force, because Turkey
never notified Libya of the completion of the requisite constitutional
formalities in Turkey for its entry into force.

b) Claimant has not shown that it holds any qualifying “investment” within
Libya for the purposes of Article 1(2) of the Turkey-Libya BIT (the ratione
materiae objection).

c) Even if Claimant had made a qualifying investment within Libya, the
dispute in issue between Claimant and Libya would be outside the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal because it arose before the Turkey-Libya BIT
entered into force (the ratione temporis objection).

d) Claimant chose to submit the dispute to the Libyan courts and cannot
now bring claims arising from the same dispute in this arbitration,
pursuant to Articles 8(2) and 8(3) of the Turkey-Libya BIT. The Libyan
court proceedings are still ongoing and have not yet resulted in a final
decision.

e) By entering into the Turkey-Libya BIT, Respondent has not consented to

the referral to arbitration of Claimant’s claims which are entirely
contractual in nature.

52. During the Hearing, Respondent abandoned its earlier objection that
Claimant is not a qualifying “investor” for the purposes of Article 1.1(b) of
the Turkey-Libya BIT.°°

53. Below, the Arbitral Tribunal summarizes the Parties’ positions on the
question of the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

A. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

|. The Validity of the BIT

 

54. The BIT has never entered into force, because Turkey never notified Libya
of the completion of the requisite constitutional formalities in Turkey for its
entry into force. Absent such notification, the BIT does not enter into force.°”

55. In this regard, Article 12(1) of the BIT provides as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall notify the other in writing of the completion of
the constitutional formalities required in its territory for the entry into force of
this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the
latter of the two notifications [...] (emphasis added)”

 

56. The Republic of Turkey did not, on 22 April 2011, validly notify the State of
Libya of the completion of its internal ratification procedure (i.e. of the
“completion of the constitutional formalities required in its territory”), as
required by Article 12(1). The notification was not sent to the proper
representative of the State of Libya. Accordingly, the requirements for entry
into force under Article 12(1) of the BIT have not been met.

57. Claimant has sought to place weight on the United Nations’ publication of
the BIT, in the UN Treaty Collection, following Turkey’s registration of the
BIT with the United Nations on 12 September 2011. Neither registration nor
subsequent publication by the United Nations however satisfies the
requirement of Article 12(1). The act of publication does not imply that the
United Nations consider the BIT to be in force or that it has made any
assessment of the treaty; the United Nations expressly states that
publication does not have the effect of conferring any legal status that is
otherwise absent.**

58. Furthermore, Respondent has not acknowledged that the BIT has entered
into force. Concerning the 2014 Political Declaration relied upon by
Claimant, a mere reference to a BIT does not suggest that either Libya or
Turkey considered the BIT to be in force. A political agreement referring to
‘equal treatment to Turkish and Libyan investors’ is not remarkable and does
not suggest a legally binding commitment to that principle, or to any of the
protections included in the BIT.39

59. In any event, the Political Declaration does not suggest that Turkey satisfied
the requirements of Article 12(1) of the BIT on 22 April 2011 or at any other
relevant time; and is not an Article 12(1) notification itself.4°

Il. Ratione Materiae Jurisdiction

60. Article 1(2) of the BIT reads:

The term "investment", in conformity with the hosting Contracting Party's laws
and regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not
exclusively:

(a) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies.

(b) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights having financial
value related to an investment,

(c) movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights as mortgages,
liens, pledges and any other similar rights related to investments as defined in
conformity with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the property is situated,

(d) industrial and intellectual property rights related to investments such as
patents, industrial designs, technical processes, as well as trademarks,
goodwill, know-how and other similar rights,

(e) business concessions conferred by law or by an investment contract,
including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural
resources in the territory of each Contracting Party; [...]

61. According to Respondent, the Settlement Agreement cannot be considered
as an “investment” under the BIT. Article 1(2) of the BIT uses the term
“investment” as a term of art and with its ordinary meaning within investment
treaties, that is, by reference to the ordinary meaning of the term, and by
reference to the objective characteristics of an investment.*1 Article 1(2)
also expressly requires that qualifying “investments” must be “in conformity
with the hosting Contracting Party's laws and regulations [...]”

62. Further, Article 8 of the BIT (“Settlement of Disputes Between One
Contracting Party and Investors of the Other Contracting Party”) states that
this Tribunal only has jurisdiction with respect to disputes that are:

‘in connection with [Claimant's] investment [...]’; and

“[...] arising directly out of investment activities which have obtained
necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant legislation of
both Contracting Parties on foreign capital, and that effectively started [...]”.

63. Accordingly, and to establish jurisdiction, Claimant must establish not only
that it has made a qualifying investment in Libya (pursuant to Article 1(2) of
the BIT), but also that the dispute in question arises in connection with the
specific qualifying investment relied upon, and arises directly out of
investment activities, and that it has obtained necessary permissions for its
investment and has “effectively started” that investment.

64. Article 1(2)(b) does not provide that “claims to money” in isolation are
investments. Rather, it provides that only “claims to money or any other
rights having financial value related to_an_ investment’ can qualify for
protection. Claims to money, without more, are not protected investments.
If the contrary were true, a winning lottery ticket would also constitute a
protected investment under the BIT as a ‘claim to money’. This cannot be
right.

65. Investment treaty arbitration tribunals have developed a general consensus,
with minor variations in expression, as to the inherent objective
characteristics of an “investment”, namely (i) duration, (ii) contribution, and
(iii) an assumption of investment risk.42

41 Statement of Defense, para. 150.

42 Statement of Defense paras. 167-171. See Exh. RLA-65, KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v.
Kazakhstan, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, para. 173 (“The Tribunal thus
concludes that the objective definition of investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT
comprises the elements of contribution or allocation of resources, duration, and risk, which includes
the expectation (albeit not necessarily fulfilled) of a commercial return”); Exh. RLA-10, Ulysseas v.
Ecuador, Final Award, 12 June 2012, para. 251 (“As held by many ICSID tribunals, the ordinary
conception of an investment includes several basic characteristics, essentially: (a) it must consist of a
contribution having an economic value; (b) it must be made for a certain duration; (c) there must be
the expectation of a return on the investment, subject to an element of risk; (d) it should contribute to
the development of the economy of the host State. While the last condition has been criticised, the
others have been generally accepted by other tribunals and commentators in the field of investment
treaty arbitration.”, emphasis added). See also Exh. CLA-21, Bosca v. Lithuania, Award, 17 May
2013, para. 168: “The Service Agreement had the necessary elements of contribution, risk and
duration typically considered basic characteristics of an investment”.

47 Rejoinder, para. 256,

The only assets listed in the BIT as potentially qualifying as investments on
a standalone basis in Article 1(2) are shareholdings of over 10% and
“business concessions conferred by law or by an_ investment
contract’. Neither type of asset is at issue in this Arbitration. Claimant held
no shareholding rights in a Libyan company and there is no “business
concession conferred by law or by an investment contract’. Neither applies
to the Settlement Agreement.

Administrative contracts of the kind relied on by Claimant could not have
qualified as “investments” under Libya’s investment laws, Respondent
argues. Under the applicable Libyan law investment contracts, unlike
administrative contracts, require the provision of upfront capital by the
foreign entity. While the BIT is governed by international law, domestic law
is relevant in assessing whether or not an “investment” has been made.*?

The Settlement Agreement is not a self-standing “investment.” The
Settlement Agreement is not a valid or binding settlement agreement under
Libyan law, and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Libyan courts.
Furthermore, the Settlement Agreement does not meet any of the
characteristics of an investment for the purpose of Article 1(2) of the BIT,
nor does it fall within any of the possible categories of investments identified
in that Article.

The Settlement Agreement is also not “tied to” another investment. The BIT
only envisages certain very specific contracts as representing qualifying
investments — “business concessions conferred by law or by an investment
contract’ — neither of which are shown to have been at issue here. In
addition, administrative contracts of the kind relied on by Claimant would not
generally qualify as investments under Libyan law, not least because they
do not involve a contribution of capital.4+

As for Claimant's “single unified investment” theory, i.e. that “Etrak’s
investment activity beginning with the initial construction projects, running
through the Court Decision and culminating in the Settlement Agreement,
taken together should be considered a single unified investment’,*®
Respondent contends that this argument would still require the showing of
relevant qualifying investments, a showing that has not been made. The
Settlement Agreement cannot be considered as a further step in one unified
investment.*°

The Settlement Agreement is not valid and binding under the governing
Libyan law, and thus cannot constitute a protected investment. In any event,
the validity of the Settlement Agreement is being challenged in the Tripoli
Proceedings. Thus, the validity of the Settlement Agreement is in abeyance,
pending a declaration of the Libyan courts.4”

ill. Ratione Temporis Jurisdiction

72. This case is an attempt to submit to a BIT tribunal a dispute that arose long
before the BIT allegedly entered into force, in violation of Article 10 of the
BIT, and in violation of the principle of non-retroactivity under international
law. Claimant's efforts to distinguish the current dispute from anything that
arose before the BIT entered into force are designed to bypass the
delimitations, in Article 10, of the scope of the BIT ratione temporis.

73. Article 10 reads:

The present Agreement shall apply to investments in the territory of a
Contracting Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors
of the other Contracting Party before or after the entry into force of this
Agreement. However, this Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have
arisen before its entry into force.

74. Claimant's arguments ignore the distinction between a “claim” and a
“dispute”. At its core, Claimant’s argument is that the Settlement Agreement
has given rise to new claims, and therefore, to a new dispute. The logic of
the argument is wrong because a claim and a dispute are different concepts;
within a single dispute, several claims can arise.*®

75. Respondent contends that the dispute before this Arbitral Tribunal is the
same dispute that resulted in the decision of the Beida Court of First
Instance on 29 October 2012. The issue for the Arbitral Tribunal to
determine is whether this dispute arose before or after 22 April 2011, in
order to decide whether it has ratione temporis jurisdiction.*9

76. There can be no serious doubt as to the crystallisation of a dispute before
the BIT is alleged to have entered into force. There was a dispute by as
early as 1991, when Claimant claims that Libya stopped making payments,
and certainly by the date just before the Libyan Revolution when Claimant's
representative consulted a lawyer to file a dispute with the Libyan courts.5°

77. Other investment arbitration tribunals have consistently looked at the
subject matter and the real cause of action to define what a dispute is. If the
central demand from the claimant remains the same, the exact forum and
process for that demand are irrelevant — the dispute still remains the same.*

This approach has been adopted by the tribunals in Luccheti v. Peru®?, ATA
v. Jordan,*3 EuroGas v. Slovakia®, and Vieira v. Chile.5®

78. The EuroGas tribunal stated the following:

The Tribunal does not accept that an investor may invoke the last event in a
series of related or similar actions by the State to claim the benefit of the treaty.
In the present case, the situation is clear-cut since there has not been a series
of (alleged) transgressions by the Respondent, but one (alleged) transgression
whose effects have been maintained throughout domestic court proceedings
and repeated decisions by the mining authorities.5°

  

79. In Respondent's view, the above explains why this Arbitral Tribunal has no
jurisdiction. The question of whether or not Libya failed for many years to
pay debts due to Claimant is not properly a matter for this Arbitral Tribunal.
It is a matter for the Libyan courts. It is a matter which Claimant had the
opportunity to address by opposing the Appeal, and still can seek to
demonstrate through the Tripoli Proceedings in defense of its, claims under
the Settlement Agreement.®”

IV. Fork-in-the-road

80. The “fork-in-the-road” provision in the BIT — Article 8(3) — prevents an
investor from submitting a dispute first to the local courts and then to
international arbitration. Since the dispute submitted to the local courts in
2012 and the dispute submitted to this Arbitral Tribunal is one overall
dispute, this Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over it.5&

  

81. Respondent does not accept the so-called triple identity test, which requires
a showing that the same dispute involving the same object and cause of
action between the same parties has been submitted to the domestic courts
of the host state, and Respondent disagrees with its strict application
advanced by Claimant. Respondent submits that a strict application of the
triple identity test would empty the fork-in-the-road clause of any practical
meaning. The correct approach is to consider whether the fundamental
basis of the two proceedings is the same.*°

82. Claimant claims that “where facts subsequent to the domestic litigation
change the fundamental nature of the dispute, Treaty claims are not

precluded by a fork-in-the- road provision.”©° Respondent agrees with this
statement as a matter of principle. However, Claimant does not explain what
facts subsequent to domestic litigation would “change the fundamental
nature of the dispute”. Respondent does not consider that there are any
such facts: Claimant is still claiming for alleged unpaid debts.

Claimant's choice to submit its dispute to local courts in 2012 must be given
full effect. As its claims in this Arbitration have the same fundamental basis
as those advanced before the Beida Court of First Instance, and pursuant
to Article 8(3) of the BIT, this Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine
them by virtue of the fork-in-the-road clause in the BIT, alternatively on the
basis that Claimant's choice to submit its dispute to local courts gave rise to
an estoppel, such that Claimant's is now prevented from submitting the
same dispute to international arbitration under the BIT.*

V. The Contractual Nature of the Claims 1

Claimant asks the Arbitral Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over purely
contractual breaches, in particular for breach of obligations arising out of the
Settlement Agreement. It asserts that such claims can be brought under
Article 8 of the BIT, which extends jurisdiction to disputes “in connection with
[the investor’s] investment ....”

The Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider any contractual claim would
still depend on Claimant having shown that the contractual obligations in
question arise from or at least are part of an investment over which the
Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione temporis. No
such showing has been made.®?

Moreover, Respondent contends that Claimant's interpretation of Article 8
is implausible. Investment treaties do not exist to provide investors with an
alternative tribunal of first instance, in relation to any breach of contract,
however banal, and regardless of the presence of any internationally
wrongful act. They exist to provide protection, in accordance with their
terms, from illegitimate State interference with an investment, in particular
as an exercise of puissance publique (sovereign authority). There is no such
State interference here.®

The ordinary meaning of a standing offer in a BIT to arbitrate “Disputes...in
connection with [the investor's] investment [...]” is an offer to arbitrate
disputes relating to the BIT’s protections. It cannot, in good faith, be
interpreted as an agreement to arbitrate other disputes — whether disputes
under contract or other non-Treaty disputes under domestic administrative,
criminal or constitutional law. Article 8 includes express language that only

FINAL AWARD ICC Arbitration 22236/ZF/AYZ

“disputes arising directly out of investment activities [...] (emphasis added)”
fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, further qualifying the standing offer of
arbitration.

Had Turkey and Libya intended to make an extraordinary standing offer of
arbitration in respect of all contractual disputes within the BIT, they could
have done so in express language. But they did not. Turkey and Libya did
not even include the more limited mechanism for (arguably) bringing certain
types of contractual disputes before a BIT tribunal — an umbrella clause —
within the BIT.

B. CLAIMANT’S POSITION

|. The Validity of the BIT

According to Claimant, the BIT entered into force on 22 April 2011.

Turkey and Libya signed the BIT on 25 November 2009, and Libya notified
Turkey of its ratification on 23 August 2010. Turkey then completed its
constitutional formalities on 14 April 2011 and notified the People's General
Committee for Foreign Communication and International Cooperation of the
State of Libya on 22 April 2011.6 Subsequently, Turkey registered the BIT
with the United Nations Secretariat. Respondent does not dispute these
facts.6”

Given these facts, Respondent’s assertion that the BIT never entered into
force is untenable for two reasons. First, the Libyan government itself
recognizes that the BIT is in force, in the 2014 Political Declaration signed
by the Prime Ministers of both countries which explicitly refers to the BIT.
Secondly, Turkey, along with many countries, had not recognized the
National Transitional Council (“NTC”) as the government of Libya on the

term ‘investment,’ in conformity with the hosting Contracting party's laws
and regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not
exclusively,” (Art. 1(2)), the parties have clearly demonstrated their intention
to define the term “investment” as broadly as possible so that it covers any
asset owned by the foreign investor.

This definition includes “returns reinvested, claims to money or any other
rights having financial value related to an investment”. The Settlement
Agreement is an “asset”. It represents “claims to money” and may also be
characterized as rights having financial value, and therefore clearly fall
within the BIT’s expansive definition of “investments.” This follows from the
plain language of the treaty.

In the Settlement Agreement, Claimant gives up a significant sum that it was
otherwise due in consideration for an agreement by Respondent for timely
payment of the agreed amounts and the withdrawal of its appeal of the Court
Decision. In doing so, it has not only given up its right to enforce the Court
Decision, it has also invested (or more precisely, re-invested) the discounted
amount with the expectation of Respondent's performance of the Settlement
Agreement. This is an investment within the meaning of the BIT.”°

Should the Arbitral Tribunal accept that the Settlement Agreement must be
tied to another investment, that requirement is met in this case.

Claimant's performance of the underlying construction contracts in the
1980s and 90s entailed the contribution of substantial amounts of capital,
equipment, and other resources for the realization of dozens of
infrastructure construction projects spanning more than a decade. As part
of those projects, Claimant purchased and utilized equipment, material, and
other resources worth millions of dollars; provided letters of guarantee and
employed hundreds of workers. Finally, Claimant invested significant know-
how into Libya. As such this activity amounted to an investment within the
meaning of the BIT.”

It is undisputed that the basis of the Court Decision is the unpaid receivables
owed by Respondent to Claimant and that the basis of the Settlement
Agreement is the Court Decision. Thus, while the Settlement Agreement is
an investment in its own right, it is also connected with the underlying
investments.”

Finally, and alternatively, should the Arbitral Tribunal conclude that the
Settlement Agreement is not an investment, Claimant's investment activity
— beginning with the initial construction projects, continuing with the Court
Decision and culminating in the Settlement Agreement — should be
considered together as a single unified investment.’”*

99. The BIT does not require assets to satisfy Respondent's purported definition
of “investment” under Libyan law. The text of the chapeu of Article 1(2) only
requires that an investor’s operations must conform to local laws and
regulation. This does not mean that a different and specialized definition of
the term “investment” must be imported from Libyan law to govern what
does or does not constitute an “investment” under the BIT.”4

100. Furthermore, Respondent's attempt to introduce an “objective” standard of
investment used by some ICSID tribunals should be rejected, for two
reasons. First, the BIT itself offers a clear scope of the term “investment”.
Secondly, tribunals have rejected Respondent’s proposed approach time
and time again.”°

Ill. Ratione Temporis Jurisdiction

 

 

101. The BIT does not exclude consideration of facts that occurred before the
date of its entry into force (“the Effective Date”). The operative part of Article
10 provides that “this Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have arisen
before its entry into force” (emphasis added). This language does not
prevent the Arbitral Tribunal from considering facts that occurred prior to the
BIT’s entry into force.”6

102. Contrary to what Respondent contends, Claimant argues that every claim
currently before this Arbitral Tribunal arises from a dispute that itself arose
after the Effective Date of the BIT. Despite Respondent's
mischaracterization, the disputes in this case concern Libya’s failure to
abide by the Settlement Agreement, which occurred after the Effective Date
of the BIT.””

103. The dispute in this Arbitration arises from Respondent's actions following
the Court Decision that its courts issued and the Settlement Agreement that
its Ministry of Finance executed. The dispute in this Arbitration has further
come to involve Respondent's acts following the initiation of this proceeding,
which acts constitute further breaches of the BIT, the Settlement Agreement
and Libyan law — viz., the revival of a long-dormant Appeal by its Ministry
of Justice and subsequent decision thereon by its Appellate Courts. All of
these actions undeniably took place after the Effective Date of the BIT.”®

104. The key date for determining when the dispute began is the date of first legal
confrontation. Claimant never filed a claim before any court or arbitral
tribunal prior to filing its complaint before the Beida Court in 2012 — after
the Effective Date of the BIT. There was no legal confrontation, and hence
no dispute, between the Parties prior to that date. The Audit Committee had
confirmed that Respondent owed Claimant a certain amount and Claimant

was willing to accept such payment as a final resolution of its unpaid
receivables. There was no conflict as to law or fact between Claimant and
Respondent until after Claimant had run the administrative gauntlet in Libya
without effect, prompting Claimant then to file its complaint over a year after
the BIT entered into force. That is the very earliest time it may be said that
the dispute had crystallized. Thus, Claimant’s claims are within this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis.

105. Even if this Arbitral Tribunal were to find that a dispute arose between the

parties at some point prior to the filing of Claimant's complaint in the Beida
Court of First Instance and prior to the Effective Date of the BIT, it
nonetheless will not be deprived of jurisdiction ratione temporis. It is well-
established that an intervening state act can give rise to a new dispute.’°

106. Finally, even if the Arbitral Tribunal were to find that the dispute before the
Libyan Courts is indistinct from this Arbitration and that there was no
intervening state act, it must then find that such dispute was extinguished
by the Settlement Agreement, which expressly provides that all existing
disputes between the parties should be “abandoned.”®°

IV. Fork-in-the-road

107. In Claimant's view, the “fork in the road” clause at Articles 8(2) and 8(3) of
the BIT cannot apply to the dispute regarding Respondent's failure to
comply with the Court Decision and the Settlement Agreement, because no
claim regarding those failures has been previously brought in any other
forum. The disputes at issue in this Arbitration do not concern the question
of whether Respondent failed to pay the underlying contract amounts (i.e.,
what was litigated in the Court Decision), but rather whether Respondent
failed to abide by a decision of its own court and its own settlement
agreement, each a separate breach of the BIT and of international law.*"

108. Tribunals consistently hold that the loss of access to international arbitration
via a fork-in-the-road provision applies only where the so-called triple
identity test is met.®* This requires a showing that the same dispute involving
the same object and cause of action between the same parties has been
submitted to the domestic courts of the host state.®

If the triple identity test is applied in this Arbitration, Respondent's argument
fails. First, whereas the cause of action in the Beida Court of First Instance
proceedings lay entirely in Libyan law, Claimant's claims in this Arbitration

are made under both Libyan and international law. Secondly, the dispute
before this Arbitral Tribunal is not identical to that submitted to the Beida
Court of First Instance.®4

2

Respondent's claim that the fork-in-the-road clause precludes a treaty claim
if the claim shares the same “fundamental basis” as claims brought in
another forum is not supported by authority. However, regardless of whether
the test proposed by Respondent is applied, the fork-in-the-road clause
does not preclude Claimant's claims in the Arbitration, because facts
subsequent to the domestic litigation have changed the fundamental nature
of the dispute.

V. The Contractual Nature of the Claims

1. The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over disputes arising from
Respondent's violations of other obligations. In Claimant’s view,
Respondent ignores the clear meaning of Article 8 of the BIT by advancing
a narrow interpretation of the article. Article 8 does not limit the jurisdiction
of a treaty tribunal only to claims that arise under the BIT.®°

N

. Case law supports the proposition that jurisdiction under Article 8 is not
confined to just the parties’ BIT obligations.®° Furthermore, as the parties
have chosen not to limit the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction to disputes arising
out of the substantive provisions of the BIT, the tribunal has jurisdiction over
claims arising directly out the contract, i.e. the Settlement Agreement.

wo

. The dispute regarding Respondent’s breach of the Settlement Agreement
is related to Claimant's investments in the construction projects and thus
falls within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. There is no ground for refusing
jurisdiction over contractual claims in this case. The Settlement Agreement
was concluded directly with a ministry of the Libyan State, not with a
separate legal entity and there is no exclusive choice of forum clause in the
Settlement Agreement. While the disputes in this Arbitration relate to the
investments in the contracts, they are distinct from the payment disputes
arising from those contracts.®”

Furthermore, Respondent initially classified its objection against Claimant’s
reliance on the BIT’s most favoured nation clause to import the so-called umbrella
clause from the Austria-Libya BIT as a jurisdictional objection.®° To the Arbitral
Tribunal, this objection is properly characterized as one pertaining to liability,
rather than jurisdiction (as supported by the manner in which the objection was
subsequently argued by the Parties). Accordingly, this objection will be discussed
in the liability section of the Award, below at para. 350.

. The Validity of the BIT

For the following reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the BIT validly entered
into force on 22 April 2011.

Article 12(1) of the BIT provides:

Each Contracting Party shall notify the other in writing of the completion of the
constitutional formalities required in its territory for the entry into force of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the latter of the
two notifications.

. It is not disputed that both Libya and Turkey completed the “constitutional

formalities” referenced in the first sentence of Article 12(1). Rather, Respondent's
objection to the BIT’s validity concerns the Article’s notification element.
Specifically, Respondent argues that Turkey did not validly notify Libya of
Turkey's completion of constitutional formalities, because Turkey did not notify
the proper entity.

. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, it has been sufficiently established that when

Turkey notified the Libyan People's General Committee for Foreign
Communication and International Cooperation,®° it properly notified what both
Turkey and the vast majority of other states regarded as the Libyan government
as per the date of notification, i.e. 22 April 2011.

. At this time, neither Turkey nor most other states had recognized the National

Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya. On the contrary,
Turkey does not appear to have recognized the NTC until September 2011. In
the intervening months Turkey maintained diplomatic relations with the previous
government, which was the entity to which Turkey sent its notification.°° This fact
alone is sufficient to establish that Turkey’s notification was in compliance with
Article 12(1) and thus triggered the BIT’s entry into force on 22 April 2011.

121. Further support for this conclusion is found in the Turkish deposit of the BIT to
the United Nations Secretariat,®' a fact to which the new Libyan government
seemingly did not object or react.

122. Moreover, in the 3 January 2014 Declaration®? the Prime Ministers of both states
make reference to the BIT in a manner evidencing that Libya was aware of the
BIT’s applicability in 2014. Under the headline “Cooperation in the Fields of
Economy, Trade, Development, Planning, Investments, Banking and Finance,
Industry, Transportation, Maritime Affairs, Tourism, and Health”, paragraph 8
expressly refers to the BIT:

Providing equal treatment to Turkish and Libyan investors without discrimination
in accordance with the Agreement concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and
Protection of Investments.%

12

wo

. Neither of these two supporting facts on its own establishes that the BIT entered
into force. Together, however, they indicate that both states treated the BIT as
having entered into force.

  
    
  
     
 
 
 
   

124. For these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Turkey-Libya BIT entered
into force on 22 April 2011.

Il. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae

125. Claimant initially argued that both the Court Decision and the Settlement
Agreement constituted investments within the meaning of the BIT. At the Hearing,
however, Claimant abandoned its reliance on the Court Decision as an
investment, and thereafter relied only on the Settlement Agreement.

126. The question whether the Settlement Agreement constitutes an investment has
two separate elements to it: first, whether the Settlement Agreement is valid
under Libyan law, and second, whether the Settlement Agreement is an
investment within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the BIT. The Arbitral Tribunal _
addresses these two issues separately, beginning with the validity of the
Settlement Agreement.

Whether the Settlement Agreement is valid under Libyan law

127. As a preliminary question, the Parties disagree on whether or not the Settlement —
Agreement is valid under Libyan law. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that it is, for th
following reasons.

128. The Arbitral Tribunal is tasked with applying international law. However, the
validity of the Settlement Agreement as a matter of Libyan law is an important
element of the Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis of whether Claimant has an investment
under Article 1(2) of the BIT. It is common ground between the Parties that the
Settlement Agreement is governed by Libyan law.®° Both Parties have presented
their arguments on this assumption. Both Parties have also submitted expert
reports based on Libyan law. In both expert opinions by Mr. Mukhtar, which were
submitted by Claimant to support its contention that the Settlement Agreement is
binding, Mr. Mukthar discusses this issue as a matter of Libyan law.%° Similarly,
Respondent's expert Dr. El-Murtadi in both his expert reports responds to the
questions put to him by Respondent “based on Libyan law and practice”.°”

129. Respondent has objected that under Libyan law, the Settlement Agreement is not
valid because the Deputy Minister of Finance did not have actual authority to sign
the Settlement Agreement on behalf of Libya.°* Instead, only the Minister of
Finance possesses this authority. Nor, in Respondent’s view, did the Deputy
Minister have apparent authority.°°

130. Claimant has argued that the Deputy Minister of Finance did have actual authority
to sign the Agreement.'°° In any event, Claimant contends that the Deputy
Minister had apparent authority to sign the Agreement. 1°

13

=

. As explained below, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Deputy Minister of Finance
did have apparent authority to sign the Settlement Agreement. In these
circumstances, there is no need to engage with the question whether the Deputy
Minister had actual authority.

132. The issue of apparent authority breaks down into two elements. First, the person
relying on apparent authority must have assumed in good faith that the agent had
authority. Secondly, the good faith must be based on an external appearance of
authority, as created by the principal. 92

133. In the textbook which both Parties’ experts discussed at the Hearing, a third
element is also mentioned: the agent acts in the name of the principal but without
actual authority.1°° This condition was not separately argued by the Parties in
their pleadings. For the Arbitral Tribunal, this condition is intimately linked with
the good faith element, and will not be discussed separately.

134. As for the first element, Respondent has argued that under Libyan law, a
contracting party purporting to rely in good faith on the apparent authority of his
counterpart must perform a certain degree of due diligence as to the authority of
his counterpart.'°* This view was expressed by both Parties’ experts on Libyan
law.

135. Claimant's expert on Libyan law Mr. Mukhtar testified on cross-examination that
although there is no direct provision on apparent authority in Libyan law, it is
discussed at length in textbooks and applied by courts.1°° Mr. Mukhtar relied on
a leading textbook written by the person who also wrote the Libyan Civil Code. 19°
This textbook describes the test for apparent authority under Libyan law, including
the due diligence required from a party which purports to rely on apparent
authority. 107

136. Similarly, Respondent's expert Dr. El-Murtadi referred to the same textbook in his
second report.1°® Dr. El-Murtadi also “broadly agreed” with Mr. Mukhtar’s
description of the requirements for applying the doctrine of apparent authority,
including the need for Claimant to prove “that it did its due diligence in respect of
the Deputy Minister’s mandate and powers, could not have discovered that the
Deputy Minister lacked the required authority to sign the settlement agreement,
and that it relied on the apparent authority of the Deputy Minister to sign the
settlement agreement on behalf of the Finance Ministry”.1°°

   
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
   

137. On the Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis, Claimant’s representative Mr. Ginay
discharged his due diligence duty in connection with the signing of the Settlement
Agreement.

138. In his efforts to have the Settlement Agreement executed, Mr. Ginay
communicated with multiple state officials, primarily at the legal department of the
Ministry of Finance. In his witness statement, Mr. Glinay recalled how officials at
the Ministry of Finance assured him that the Deputy Minister was the official
authorized to sign the Agreement.‘?° The two officials at the Ministry with whom
Mr. Ginay interacted also occasionally mentioned the Deputy Minister as the
Official in charge of the settlement."

139. Furthermore, the Deputy Minister was copied in correspondence during the
negotiations, as confirmed by numerous intra-government letters.172 Most of

these letters were shared with Mr. Giinay and Mr. Hasasu, a long-time employee
of Claimant’s, who also acted as Mr Giinay’s Arabic translator.1"3

140. In particular, in his witness statement Mr. Giinay recalls seeing a letter from
Bashir Ali Elaktari, the Deputy Minister of the State Litigation Department, sent to
the Deputy Minister.1"4 This letter, of which Mr. Giinay took a photograph, ">
updates the Deputy Minister on the settlement discussions. It also recognizes
that “this Department [the State Litigation Department] is not authorized to
propose any settlement or to meet with the party concerned in your absence”.116

14

a

. Inhis discussions with officials of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance,
Mr. Giinay ultimately offered a 10% discount on the receivables owed to
Claimant, in order to reach a settlement. That offer was incorporated into a letter
sent from the Litigation Department Manager Mr. Tarik Ahmed El Velid to the
Deputy Minister in October 2013.1"” In this letter, the draft version of the
Agreement contained a block on the last page where there was space reserved
for the Deputy Minister's signature. ‘'® The letter was shown to Mr. Glinay.""?

142. Mr. Giinay has also stated that he and Mr. Hasasu saw letters on a table while
visiting the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance as part of the
negotiations. These letters were from other Turkish companies in similar
situations, and were addressed to the Deputy Minister.’?° During cross-
examination, Mr. Giinay stated that these letters “were kept open on the table
and we were sitting around that table. Most of them had a signature part open
with the name of the deputy’.'24 Although Mr. Giinay himself does not read
Arabic, he was in the company of Mr. Hasasu, who does. Mr. Ginay testified that
Mr. Hasasu explained the content of the letters on the table. '2

143. In addition, Mr. Giinay has testified that when he delivered the draft Settlement
Agreement to the Ministry of Finance’s budget department, they remarked that
the document lacked a specified date, and returned it to be dated.'*° The budget
department did not raise any concern about the Deputy Minister’s authority to
sign. 124

144. Taken together, these efforts demonstrate sufficient due diligence from Mr.
Giinay, in his attempts to ascertain that the Deputy Minister had the authority to
sign the Settlement Agreement on behalf of Respondent.

145. At the very least, Mr Giinay’s efforts provided various state officials with the
opportunity to rectify the situation, if their view at the time was indeed that the
Deputy Minister was not authorized. At no point during the negotiations did any
Libyan official indicate to Mr. Ginay that the Deputy Minister did not have the
required authority to sign the Settlement Agreement.

146. After the Settlement Agreement was signed, the Deputy Minister in March 2014
provided a proof of his signature to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to
establish that it was the Deputy Minister who had signed the Agreement."?5 This
proof was provided following Claimant’s request to have the Settlement
Agreement internationally recognized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.1° The
Deputy Minister sent proof of his signature, and the Minister of Finance himself
was copied on the transmittal letter. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, this confirms,
albeit ex post facto, that the Minister of Finance did not question that the Deputy
Minister was authorized to sign the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the
Ministry.

147. A notification explaining Libya’s current view that the Deputy Minister was not
authorized to sign the Agreement came only in November 2017, when the present
Arbitration was well underway. 127

148. For the above reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimant's representative
Mr. Giinay in good faith relied on the apparent authority of the Deputy Minister of
Finance to sign the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Ministry, and thus of
the Respondent.

149. As per the second element referred to above, Mr. Giinay’s good faith must be
based on an external appearance that the Deputy Minister was in fact authorized.
The appearance must have been created by the principal, i.e. the Ministry of
Finance, including with the knowledge or acquiescence of the Minister himself.17°

150. The facts discussed above in paragraphs 135-145 show that there was an
external appearance created by the Ministry. There were direct representations
by officers of the Ministry that the Deputy Minister was authorized. There were
also several other indications, such as the letters addressed to the Deputy
Minister which were visible at the Ministry, and the Ministry's budget department's
failure to react to the Deputy Minister's signature. It is difficult to accept that the
practice of the Deputy Minister's involvement in such matters, apparently

accepted by all these officers and departments, was unknown to the Minister of
Finance himself. Indeed, as noted above, the Minister was personally copied
later on the Deputy Minister’s proof of signature, provided at the request of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the express purpose of certifying the official status
of the Settlement Agreement, and made no objection to the Deputy Minister's
authorization to act. At the very least, this constituted acquiescence at the
highest level to the Deputy Minister's action, cementing the external appearance
of authorization created by the acts of other Ministry officials.

. Having found that Mr. Giinay in good faith relied on representations of authority
created by an external appearance that the Deputy Minister could act on behalf
of the Ministry of Finance, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Deputy Minister had
apparent authority to sign the Settlement Agreement with binding effect.

Respondent has also argued that in any event, the validity of the Settlement
Agreement is currently subject to the Tripoli Proceedings. Based on the evidence
presented to it, the Arbitral Tribunal is persuaded that as a matter of fact, the
Settlement Agreement is valid under Libyan law. For the present purposes, this
conclusion is not affected by the fact that Respondent argues otherwise before a
Libyan court.

153. Having found that the Settlement Agreement is valid under Libyan law, the

Arbitral Tribunal now turns to the question whether it is a protected investment
for the purposes of the BIT.

Whether the Settlement Agreement constitutes an ‘investment’ within the meaning
of Article 1(2) of the BIT

154. Article 1(2) of the BIT defines an “investment” in the following way:

 

The term "investment", in conformity with the hosting Contracting Party's laws
and regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not exclusively:

(a) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies.

(b) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights having financial value
related to an investment,

(c) movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights as mortgages,
liens,
pledges and any other similar rights related to investments as defined in
conformity with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the property is situated,

(d) industrial and intellectual property rights related to investments such as patents,
industrial designs, technical processes, as well as trademarks, goodwill, know-
how and other similar rights,

(e) business concessions conferred by law or by an investment contract, including

concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources in the

territory of each Contracting Party; [...]

 

 

  

FINAL AWARD ICC Arbitration 22236/ZF/AYZ

  
 

155. Claimant has argued that the Settlement Agreement is a protected investment
either on its own, or alternatively because it constitutes “claims to money or any
other rights having financial value related to an investment’ within the meaning
of Article 1(2)(b).

 
   
     
 

15}

a

. For the reasons set out below, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Settlement
Agreement is a qualifying investment because it constitutes “claims to money [...]
related to an investment”. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore does not need to, nor
will it, rule on the issue whether the Settlement Agreement is a protected
investment on its own.

 
       
   
 

15)

N

The Settlement Agreement constitutes “claims to money”. It follows expressly
from the terms of the Settlement Agreement that it entitles Claimant to LD
5,420,308.707. Article 3 of the Agreement reads:

      
    

The First Party [Ministry of Finance] shall pay the agreed sum after the waiver, a
total of LD 5,420,308.707 (Five Million Four Hundred Twenty Thousand Three
Hundred Eight Libyan Dinars and 707 Dirhams) in favor of the Second Party
[Claimant] in two installments, to the account specified by the Second Party [...]
(brackets inserted) 179

 
   
   
   
   
 

158. Furthermore, the Settlement Agreement is “related to an investment”, in that it
flows from, and crystallizes, a range of earlier investments.

. It is undisputed that Claimant was engaged in construction works in Libya in the
1980s and 1990s. Photographs submitted by Claimant show construction sites,
including activities involving heavy equipment such as a cement mixer and a
shovel.'*° Claimant has also submitted various photographs showing Claimant's
employees together with Libyan officials on construction sites in Libya. ‘5

161. There are numerous unpaid receivables listed by the 2008 Audit Committee
Report'®> — the authenticity of which is not disputed by Respondent — which
appear to relate to previous construction activities. 1°

. Finally, the detailed statements and testimony by both Mr. Giinay and Mr. Hasasu
show the extent of Claimant’s activities. Mr Guinay has referred to Claimant's
“more than 35 projects” in Libya during the 1980s and 1990s.'9” Mr. Hasasu, who
joined Claimant in 1991,'* has confirmed this assessment.'*9 Mr. Hasasu has
testified that in the early 1990s, the value of all projects exceeded USD 100
million, and the number of employees in Libya were about 1000.‘4° He has also
described specific projects, including an airport, several housing projects (the
largest of which included more than 100 separate houses), a sports hall and
military camps. "4"

. Taken together, Claimant's activities during the 1980s and 1990s constitute
investments in the meaning of Article 1(2) of the BIT. Respondent has not
presented any evidence pointing in the opposite direction.

. These investments ultimately led to both the Court Decision and, eventually, the
Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement is thus a “claim to money
related to an investment”, as required by Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.

. The earlier investments, unlike the Settlement Agreement, pre-date the entry into
force of the BIT in April 2011. However, this is not an obstacle for the purposes
of the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The controlling provision in this respect is
Article X. It reads:

The present Agreement shall apply to investments in the territory of a Contracting
Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other
Contracting Party before or after the entry into force of this Agreement. However,
this Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have arisen before its entry into
force (emphasis added).

. Thus, the BIT protects investments, but not disputes, that pre-date the entry into
force of the treaty. The fact that the construction activities pre-date 22 April 2011
therefore does not present an obstacle to the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione materiae. Whether or not the “dispute” pre-dates this date is discussed
below at paras. 168-188.

167. In sum, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae because the
Settlement Agreement is a claim to money related to an investment as stipulated
in Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.

168. Given the detailed discussion in paras. 154-167, there is no need to discuss the
so-called Salini criteria.

Ill. Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis

169. Article 10 of the BIT, which regulates the treaty’s scope of application, states that:
“[...] this Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have arisen before its entry
into force” (emphasis added). Article 8(1) provides for arbitration over “Disputes
between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, in connection with his investment [...]” (emphasis added).

170. The Parties disagree about when the present dispute arose. Respondent has
based its objection on the contention that its alleged non-compliance with the
Settlement Agreement is but one element of a long-running dispute which pre-
dates the entry into force of the BIT. Claimant is of the view that Respondent's
alleged non-compliance with the Settlement Agreement creates a new dispute,
separate from the disagreements pre-dating the Agreement.

17

=

. Both Parties have advanced arguments based on arbitral jurisprudence
concerning what should be regarded as a “new dispute” and a “continuous
dispute’, respectively.

17:

nN

. While the Arbitral Tribunal has weighed carefully the arguments based on the
findings by other tribunals, it ultimately finds Respondent’s objection to be
unconvincing. Unlike the cases advanced by Respondent as authority for its
broad reading of what constitutes one and the same “dispute”, the case before
this Arbitral Tribunal involves a valid Settlement Agreement, which under the
applicable Libyan law extinguishes all prior disputes between the Parties.

17:

o

. In Lucchetti v. Peru,42 which Respondent describes as the “landmark” case on
what is a “new” dispute, “4° the tribunal declined jurisdiction after having found that
the BIT dispute concerned the same subject-matter as an earlier dispute which
pre-dated the BIT. ‘44 The tribunal ultimately held that the earlier dispute and the
later dispute had the same subject-matter and the “same origin or source: the
municipality's desire to ensure that its environmental policies are complied with
and Claimants’ efforts to block their application”. 14°

174. Respondent has also argued that a number of subsequent tribunals followed the
general approach adopted by the Lucchetti tribunal.

175. In ATA v. Jordan, “6 an arbitral tribunal had issued an award against a Jordanian
entity, which was then set aside by Jordanian courts. When the investor initiated
BIT arbitration, the tribunal declined jurisdiction ratione temporis. \t held that “the
dispute giving rise to the Claimant's claims in this proceeding [...] [was] legally
equivalent to the contractual dispute which [gave rise to the first award]”.'47

176. The tribunal in Eurogas v. Slovakia stated that “[w]hat matters is the real cause
of the dispute”.'4° The BIT dispute concerned a mining license which had been
re-assigned by the state. The investor successfully challenged this re-assignment
twice before local courts prior to the BIT’s entry into force. When the investor
ultimately initiated BIT arbitration, it relied on post-BIT facts, but the tribunal
declined jurisdiction on ratione temporis grounds. The tribunal held that the post-
BIT facts could not be considered as “the source of a new dispute; rather they
were a refusal to resolve the ongoing dispute, which arose from the alleged
breach [before the entry into force of the BIT]’.149

177. Finally, during its closing statements at the Hearing, Respondent also relied on
Vieira v. Chile.‘ In that case, the dispute concerned whether the investor could
fish in offshore waters outside of Chile. The Vieira tribunal ultimately found that
the dispute had already arisen when the BIT entered into force. 51 Respondent
has argued that the essence of this dispute remained the same, despite the fact
that the investor argued its case under different legal grounds and in different fora
before bringing it to BIT arbitration. 15

178. In Claimant’s view, none of these cases relied upon by Respondent involved a
mutual agreement between the parties to settle the dispute, such as the
Settlement Agreement."

179. For the Arbitral Tribunal, the present case is different from the situations
described in these prior awards relied upon by Respondent. The distinguishing
factor is the Settlement Agreement, which under Libyan law extinguishes prior
disputes between the Parties.

180. As explained above, in paras. 127-153, the Settlement Agreement is valid and
binding under Libyan law. It follows expressly from the Agreement that “any
domestic or international court litigation, application for enforcement abroad, or

. Both Parties’ experts on Libyan law agree that a compromise, such as the

 

 

40

any court or administrative liens, whether international or domestic, in relation to
the ruling subject hereof, shall be abandoned”. 54

. In addition to the express wording of Article 7 of the Settlement Agreement,

Libyan law provides for the extinguishing effect of the Agreement. Under Libyan
law, the Settlement Agreement is characterized as a “compromise”. Article 548
of the Libyan Civil Code provides:

Compromise is a contract by which two parties put an end to a dispute that has
arisen, or prevent a dispute that is expected to arise, by the mutual surrender of
part of their respective claim.

   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

Settlement Agreement, extinguishes any prior disputes between the Parties.
Claimant’s expert Mr. Mukhtar says this expressly in his Second Opinion, in which
he states that:

The Settlement Agreement in this case is exactly what is defined by the Libyan
Civil Code as compromise. Thus, it ended any potential dispute between the
parties with respect to the Court Decision. This is further confirmed by the express
provision in Article 7 of the Settlement Agreement whereby the parties agreed to
withdraw any proceedings with respect to the Court Decision. 15°

When questioned by Claimant's counsel at the hearing, Respondent's expert Dr.
El-Murtadi also stated that as a matter of Libyan law, a compromise puts an end
to the prior disputes between the parties:

Q. You would agree, Dr El-Murtadi, that under Libyan law a compromise has the
effect of putting an end to a dispute that has arisen?

A. Yes, that's right.

Q. And that under Article 552 that a compromise terminates the disputes in
respect of which the compromise is made?

A. That's right.

Q. If you have a compromise under Libyan law,that means that it puts an end to
the prior disputes. Am | right about that?

A. Yes, you are correct.

Q. In the event that the compromise agreement is breached the parties are limited
to their right to enforce the settlement. They cannot go back to recreate the prior
disputes; am | correct? ze
A. You are correct.”

184. With the signing of the Settlement Agreement in December 2013, both Parties

agreed to settle all prior disputes as part of a bargain by which Claimant agreed
to accept a discounted version of the receivables owed to it. Respondent's
subsequent alleged non-compliance with this Agreement gave rise to a new
dispute, separate from earlier disagreements over what was owed to Claimant.

Since the Settlement Agreement put an end to the prior disputes between the
Parties, Respondent’s objection that Claimant's earlier disagreements with
various Libyan public entities share the same “real cause” or the same
“underlying substance” as the disagreements post-dating the Settlement
Agreement is not relevant here. The Settlement Agreement creates a break in
the timeline of the Parties’ disagreement.

Thus, the “disputes”, for the purposes of both Article 8 and Article 10 of the BIT,
have arisen in relation to Respondent's alleged non-compliance with the
Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement was concluded in December
2013, and the BIT entered into force on 22 April 2011. Thus, any dispute
concerning the Settlement Agreement post-dates the entry into force of the BIT.
The Arbitral Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction ratione temporis over the present
dispute.

IV. _Fork-in-the-road

187. As with the dispute about jurisdiction ratione temporis (paras. 168-185), the

Parties’ disagreement concerning the consequences of Articles 8(2)-8(3) of the
BIT centers on the nature of the “dispute(s)”.

Respondent claims that the fork-in-the-road clause prevents Claimant from
resorting to arbitration under the BIT, because the claims brought in this
Arbitration share the same fundamental basis as claims already brought by
Claimant in the Libyan courts. The fork-in-the-road clause would therefore
operate to prevent Claimant from bringing essentially the same dispute to
international arbitration, because according to Article 8(3) the choice first to bring
its case to domestic court is “final”. In the alternative, Respondent has objected
that Claimant's choice to submit the same dispute to Libyan courts has given rise
to an estoppel, which would prevent it from bringing the same dispute to
international arbitration.

. Claimant has argued that the fork-in-the-road clause does not prevent Claimant

from bringing the present Arbitration. It claims that the so-called “triple identity
test” must be applied and that the result of this test is that the earlier disputes are
different from the present arbitration.

. There is no need for the Arbitral Tribunal to engage with the Parties’ broader

arguments regarding the scope and interpretation of fork-in-the-road clauses
generally or under this specific BIT. As explained in paras. 125-150, the
Settlement Agreement extinguishes previous disputes, including the domestic
litigation which was initiated by Claimant and which led to the Court Decision and
the Appeal.

 

 

FINAL AWARD ICC Arbitration 22236/ZF/AYZ

42

191. The Settlement Agreement thus constitutes a new agreement between the
Parties. The Arbitral Tribunal has been asked to determine whether Respondent’s
alleged non-compliance with that agreement violates the BIT. As explained in
paras. 164-181, that is a different dispute from the dispute(s) that preceded the
Settlement Agreement.

192. For these reasons, neither Respondent's primary contention that the fork-in-the-
road clause bars Claimant's BIT claims, nor its secondary position that Claimant's
choice to initiate the Libyan court proceedings would “estop” it from then bringing
this Arbitration, is accepted by the Arbitral Tribunal.

V. The Contractual Nature of the Claims

193. In paras. 125-168, the Arbitral Tribunal has found that the Settlement Agreement
is a protected investment under the BIT. Under these circumstances, there is no
need for the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on Claimant's alternative claim that the
Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction in any event based on the Settlement Agreement
as a contract.

Vil. LIABILITY
A. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
194. The Claimant brings its claims under several different provisions of the BIT.

195. Article 2(2) of the BIT reads:

“Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded
fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection in the territory of the
other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use
enjoyment, extension, or disposal of such investments”

196. Article 4 of the BIT obligates Libya not to expropriate an investor’s investment
except under certain conditions. It reads:

“Investments shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subject, directly or
indirectly, to measures of similar effects except for a public purpose, in a non-
discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation, and in accordance with due process of law and the general
principles of treatment provided for in Article 3 of this Agreement”

FINAL AWARD ICC Arbitration 22236/ZF/AYZ

197. Claimant also argues that Articles 3(2)-3(3) of the BIT work to “import” the
Umbrella Clause in Article 8(1) of the Austria-Libya BIT. Article 3(2)-3(3) of the
BIT read:

“(2). Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns
of investors of other Contracting Party to treatment less favorable than that which
it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investments or
returns of investors of any third State, whichever is the most favorable.

(3). Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other
Contracting Party, as regards management, use, enjoyment or disposal of their
investments to treatment less favorable than that which it accords fo its own
investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is the most favorable.

198. The Umbrella Clause in Article 8(1) in the Austria-Libya BIT reads:

“Each Contracting party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with
regard to specific investments by investors of the other Contracting Party.”

19!

©

In addition to the BIT provisions cited above, Claimant also argues on contractual
grounds (as opposed to treaty-based) that Respondent has breached the
Settlement Agreement.

200. Respondent disputes liability under any of these grounds.

20

. The Parties’ respective positions on the merits of the dispute are summarized
below.

B. CLAIMANT’S POSITION

|. Fair and Equitable Treatment - Legitimate Expectations

202. Despite the difficulties faced by tribunals in clearly defining the fair and equitable
treatment obligation, it is settled law that “legitimate expectations is now part of
the FET standard.”"*

158 Exh. CLA-53, Crystallex v. Venezuela, fn. 766; Exh. CLA-51, Saluka v. Czech Republic, para. 302;

162 Reply, para. 300.

Respondent's characterization of Claimant's expectations and rights under the
Settlement Agreement as “hopes” that a “debt” will be paid downplays and
mischaracterizes an official agreement. In this vein, Respondent cites Parkerings
v. Lithuania, where the tribunal held that “not every hope amount[s] to an
expectation under international law.”'®9 In this case, Claimant’s expectation was
that Respondent would comply with a specific representation to settle a state debt
that had been affirmed.

Moreover, and on a general level, Claimant had a legitimate expectation at the
time it initiated legal proceedings before a Libyan Court that Respondent would
abide by its own laws and would comply with any decision issued by Libyan courts
in keeping with basic principles of due process and the rule of law. Not only has
Respondent failed to meet this basic and legitimate expectation, it has also
aggravated its breach by engaging in the Appeal process. Moreover, redress
before national courts is not a meaningful option for Claimant. 1°

Legitimate expectations are created at, but not limited to, the time the investment
decision is made. They may change and vary over the course of an investment.1®"

Post-investment expectations can be included within the scope of the FET.
However, even if the expectations to be assessed are limited to those at the time
of making the investment, Claimant's expectations in connection with the
Settlement Agreement must be taken into account. The Settlement Agreement
constitutes an investment in and of itself and thus marks a point in time when
Claimant relied on such expectations to make an investment. '®2

However, Respondent’s attempt to narrow the FET obligation to legitimate
expectations must be rejected.

Fair and Equitable Treatment - Denial of Justice

Claimant sued Respondent in Libyan court. The court issued a decision in
Claimant's favour and ordered Respondent to pay Claimant damages.
Respondent never did so, but rather induced Claimant to sign a settlement
agreement which Respondent never performed. Respondent's claim that the
Court Decision is the basis of an on-going Appeal does nothing but support the
conclusion that Respondent has treated Claimant unfairly. Representatives from

Respondent assured Claimant that the Appeal would be withdrawn and signed
the Settlement Agreement which required that it in fact be withdrawn. "©?

Not only has Libya failed to meet basic requirements of the rule of law, it has done
so without regard to basic principles of good faith and by engaging in an abusive
Appeal process. In contravention of the Settlement Agreement and prevailing
Libyan law, Libya obtained an Appeal Decision wrongfully overturning the Court
Decision. The pursuit of this Appeal was undertaken by the State Litigation
Department (“SLD”), an entity which is a state actor.

The wrongfulness of Libya’s pursuit of the Appeal is confirmed by the appeal
decision in the similar Denfarm case, which established that the two objections
that Respondent lodges against the enforceability of the Settlement Agreement
are in fact meritless as a matter of Libyan law.

. Claimant argues that Respondent, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement,

had no right to pursue the Appeal absent an intervening nullification of the
Settlement Agreement. The Appeal is further evidence that Respondent has
violated its obligations towards Claimant by not being transparent, making false
representations regarding the withdrawal of the Appeal and by failing to adhere
to standards of due process and notice. 1°

It is not disputed between the Parties that the Beida Court of Appeal proceeded
without the original case file before it. Thus, it ruled without the original version of
the decision of the Court of First Instance, the alleged original Appeal submission,
and the document that related to the alleged irregularity in the service upon Libya
of Claimant's initial submission to the Beida Court of First Instance. 1° Under
Libyan law, it is impermissible for the Court of Appeal to render a decision in the
absence of the original court decision against which the appeal was brought. The
absence of the original case file and the relevant original documents becomes
even more important when considering that the sole basis for the decision of the
Court of Appeal is the alleged irregularity in the service of Claimant's statement
of claim in the court of first instance case. The only document that concerns the
service issue is Claimant's initial statement of claim, which bears the official
statement of the bailiff, who states that he actually served the document. The
Court of Appeal discards this official statement — which may only be done by
preliminarily establishing that the bailiff had actually committed forgery or the
crime of lying — and concludes that the bailiff must be lying. This is improper in

Fair and Equitable Treatment - Arbitrary/unreasonable acts

213. Numerous tribunals have found that where a State’s conduct is arbitrary or
unreasonable and thus lacking in any legitimate motive, that conduct could give
tise to breach of the State’s FET obligations. 1®

214. Moreover, it is well-settled that included in a State’s FET obligation is a duty to
act consistently and transparently. Linked to the notion of transparency is the
concept of consistency, which requires that “[o]Jne arm of the State cannot [...]
affirm what another arm denies to the detriment of a foreign investor.”"®? Where
a State engages in inconsistent behaviour to the detriment of the investor, such
behaviour is lacking in transparency and constitutes a breach of the State’s fair
and equitable treatment obligation. This is particularly true where one arm of the
state contradicts another arm, as has occurred in this case. Specifically, the
Ministry of Finance, the State Budget Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
have at all times considered the Settlement Agreement as binding and treated it
as such. In contrast, while initially treating the Agreement as binding, the Ministry
of Justice, via the State Litigation Department, in this Arbitration now treats it as
non-binding. This treatment is both inconsistent with its prior position as well as
with the positions of the Ministry of Finance, the State Budget Office and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 17°

. Claimant performed numerous construction contracts from which Libya received
great benefit. Respondent, while it has repeatedly acknowledged the existence
of its debt, has also created legal and administrative barriers to Claimant's
attempts to collect what it was due. In doing so, Respondent has failed to act with
transparency, consistency and good faith and has violated Claimant’s legitimate
expectations that Libya would both fulfil the terms of its agreements and would
follow the requirements of its own laws.17"

216. Furthermore, a state can breach its FET obligations when it induces an investor
into agreement with promises of compensation and fails to pay compensation. In
this regard, the von Pezold v. Zimbabwe case is illustrative. In that case, the

tribunal found a violation of FET where the state induced the investors to sign
certain agreements regarding their water rights with promises of compensation
and failed to pay that compensation. 172

‘Contractual violations” as FET breach

Respondent argues that a simple breach of contract does not amount to a breach
of legitimate expectations or its FET obligation. Respondent further argues that
its FET obligation may be breached only if the host State acted in the exercise of
sovereign authority.

According to Claimant, Respondent's contentions fail for two reasons. First, a
State’s violation of its contractual obligations may constitute a violation of the FET
standard. Secondly, Respondent's breaches in this case cannot be reduced to a
simple breach of contract.

The mere fact that a State engages with an investor via the conclusion of a
contract does not automatically render that relationship a commercial one. 173 The
factual background against which that contract was concluded must be taken into
account. For instance, in a very recent award, the Teinver v. Argentina tribunal
found that Argentina’s breach of an agreement to purchase shares amounted to
a breach of Argentina’s fair and equitable treatment obligations. In reaching this
conclusion, the tribunal observed that the agreement was “not simply a
commercial agreement” but rather one that was entered into by the State with the
intent to put an end to a long-fraught relationship between claimant and
Argentina. 174

As in the Teinver case, the Settlement Agreement is actually an agreement

intended not for a commercial purpose but rather to settle a then-existing dispute
between Respondent and Claimant.

i. Expropriation

. Expropriation is not limited to tangible property rights. Tribunals have interpreted

expropriation provisions broadly to encompass expropriation of intangible
property.

When the facts of this case are considered in light of the accepted law on
expropriation, it is clear that Claimant has been the victim of expropriation.

AWARD ICC Arbitration 22236/ZFIAYZ
48

It is a well-established principle of investment law that contractual rights are
capable of being expropriated, provided that they qualify as investments under
the relevant BIT. The Settlement Agreement and its rights thereunder qualify
as investments. It follows that it may be the subject of an expropriation
analysis. 175

Furthermore, contrary to Respondent’s assertion, both State action and inaction
can give rise to an expropriation. Respondent characterizes its non-payment as
an omission and then concludes that an omission cannot give rise to an
expropriation. Setting aside for a moment that this case involves more than
simple omission on behalf of the state actors, a weight of authority holds that
omissions as well as positive acts can give rise to expropriation. There is no
distinction between acts and omissions under international law for the purpose of
determining the responsibility of a State, as affirmed by the Commentary on the
International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for
Internationally Wrongful Acts (“the ILC Articles’), Article 2.176

. Moreover, in Claimant's view, when determining whether expropriation has

occurred, the Arbitral Tribunal should examine the cumulative acts and omissions
of the State and not, as Respondent contends, the mere fact of non-payment in
isolation. Although the key features of Respondent's expropriatory conduct are
its breaches of the Settlement Agreement by non-payment and reactivation of the
Appeal process, its acts and omissions since Claimant first sued in Libyan Court
in 2012 should be considered together.1””

The central tenet of Respondent's defense rests on its assumption that a breach
of contract cannot give rise to an expropriation. This is incorrect. A breach of
contract can give rise to an expropriation where it (i) amounts to a direct
repudiation of the contract or is carried out by means of state action, or, as in this
case, (ii) has the effect of depriving the investor of his investment. Respondent
also argues that Claimant's investment was not expropriated since it can still seek
to enforce its rights in Libyan courts. This contention is similarly flawed.178

First, Respondent's repudiation of the Settlement Agreement constitutes
expropriation. Investment tribunals have repeatedly found that breaches of
contract that result in substantial deprivation of the economic value of the
agreement or that constitute repudiation of the relevant contract amount to
expropriation.'7° In an effort to support its arguments, Respondent relies on a

series of cases in which the tribunals rejected claims of expropriation for non-
payment, as opposed to repudiation, of a contract. However, the present case
involves far more than the non-payment of a commercial contract. Indeed, the
dicta of the cases relied on by Respondent indicate that egregious and concerted
actions on behalf of the State could amount to expropriation. 1°

. Secondly, Respondent's contention that there can be no expropriation because

Claimant could have enforced its rights in Libyan courts must be rejected for the
following reasons. There is no requirement to exhaust local remedies. The cases
cited by Respondent stand merely for the proposition that in the context of a
commercial breach (which is not the type of breach at issue here), a State must
make its courts available and failure to do so would give rise to expropriation.
Each of these decisions recognizes that when an ordinary commercial contractual
breach —i.e., a breach that does not involve an element of sovereign conduct —
is at issue, an investor must first attempt to remedy that breach in local courts, if
available. If such courts are not available, then this transforms a simple
commercial breach into an expropriation. However, the Settlement Agreement is
not a commercial agreement and its breach by Respondent is not a simple
commercial breach. This alone calls into question the basis for Respondent's
insistence that local remedies must be exhausted. 11

. In Claimant’s view, the Settlement Agreement put an end to a judicial process. It

is an unconditional, unreserved and straightforward assumption of an obligation
by Libya (i.e., state action). The Parties concluded the Settlement Agreement to
settle the amount ordered to be paid by a Libyan court (again, state action).
Different entities within the Libyan administration, namely the State Litigation
Department and the Ministry of Finance, examined and evaluated the Court
Decision and concluded that settlement was in Libya’s best interests (once more,
state action). Respondent also agreed to discontinue any judicial proceedings
regarding the amount settled by the Settlement Agreement (yet again, state
action). The very existence of the Settlement Agreement is the result of state
action, the presence of which puts to rest Respondent's argument that Claimant
was required to resort to Libyan courts. 1®2

Even if this Arbitral Tribunal were to find that Claimant would have been required
to return to Libyan domestic court to adjudicate its claims arising from the
Settlement Agreement, it should nevertheless find that the continuous non-
performance of the Settlement Agreement has amounted to a “definitive denial of
the right,” due to the nature of the Settlement Agreement, without any need for
further recourse to local courts. 85

Finally, Claimant notes that Respondent’s arguments make no practical sense.
This Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims arising directly out of the
Settlement Agreement. If the fork-in-the-road clause in the BIT is read as
requiring Claimant first to bring claims arising from the Settlement Agreement
before the Libyan Courts, that would deprive the Claimant of its right to have
recourse to this Arbitral Tribunal. Thus, Respondent's view, if adopted, would
render useless the rights that the BIT guarantees. The Arbitral Tribunal should
not countenance such a result. 1%

ill. Umbrella Clause

Claimant contends that the MFN clause in the BIT allows Claimant to rely
on more favourable standards of protection contained in other investment
treaties. This extends to umbrella clauses and, in particular, to the umbrella
clause contained in the Austria-Libya BIT. 18°

The express purpose of Articles 3(2)-3(3) is to ensure the most favourable
possible treatment to investments and to investors. Claimant is thus entitled
to more favourable treatment (constituting a better substantive protection)
included in treaties with third parties, as compared to the treatment
contained in the Turkey-Libya BIT.18°

There is no restriction in the MFN clause which explicitly confines its
application to the clauses of the BIT. The MFN clause itself, despite
implementing specific restrictions with respect to certain issues, does not
restrict its application to other substantive standards including umbrella
clauses. Consequently, the MFN clause allows Claimant to import any
standard of substantive protection that is more favourable than the
protection afforded under the BIT. 187 a

 
  
 
    
   

The umbrella clause in the Austria-Libya BIT is such a standard, as it
provides investors greater investment protection than that provided under
the Turkey-Libya BIT. It does so by imposing a specific obligation on Libya
to respect its contractual and other commitments it enters into with investors
and by rendering a breach of such commitment a violation of the BIT.
Claimant is therefore entitled to rely on this clause of the Austria-Libya BIT
as part of Libya’s responsibility to Etrak under the Turkey-Libya BIT. 18°

236. Article 8(1) of the Austria-Libya BIT uses mandatory language and is broadly
written. By using the phrase “shall observe” it imposes a mandatory duty on
Respondent that cannot be escaped. Further, ‘"[a]ny” obligation is capacious; it
means not only obligations of a certain type, but “any” - that is to say, all...’”.18°
The Umbrella Clause in the Austria-Libya BIT, by its own terms, obligates Libya
to observe all obligations it has entered into vis a vis specific investments it has
entered into with investors such as Claimant. This wording explicitly extends to
all obligations, international or domestic, contractual or non-contractual. As a
consequence, contrary to Respondent's objection that the clause does not permit
the Arbitral Tribunal to entertain contractual claims, breaches by Respondent of
specific obligations owed to Claimant become equally breaches of both the BIT
and the obligation, i.e. the contract, itself.1°°

. As for the Settlement Agreement, the obligations therein are clearly defined as (i)
an obligation to pay Claimant the agreed sums by the agreed dates, and (ii) an

The Settlement Agreement was entered into by authorities of the State, namely
senior officials of the Ministry of Finance acting in their official capacity. The
Agreement has been disregarded by Respondent, which has neither paid the
sums due, nor withdrawn the Appeal.19%

o

In addition to Respondent's objection that the clause does not permit the Arbitral
Tribunal to entertain contractual claims, Respondent also argues that the
Settlement Agreement and its breach do not involve puissance publique
(sovereign authority), and that umbrella clauses cannot override an exclusive
jurisdiction provision for contractual disputes. In Claimant’s view, none of these
grounds is tenable.

24

. Under the umbrella clause, Respondent is obligated to observe the obligations
that the umbrella clause may entail, and any breach of any such obligations

. The wording of the clause is clear in that it concerns “any obligation.” The
language in the BIT neither specifies coverage only for obligations that the host
State assumes in its exercise of state authority nor bases coverage on whether
the observance or breach of such obligations concerns state action. There is no
need to identify any exercise of sovereign authority. In any event, the obligations

that Respondent breached are not ordinary commercial obligations; rather, they
are obligations that Libya, as a sovereign party, assumed as part of Libyan
governmental policy. 1%

24:

N

Finally, Respondent's argument that the umbrella clause is not applicable in the
presence of an exclusive jurisdiction provision is also meritless. It is true that
certain investment tribunals have refrained from extending the applicability of an
umbrella clause when-a contract contains a choice of forum clause providing
exclusive jurisdiction for another forum. In the Settlement Agreement, however,
there is no choice of forum clause, let alone an exclusive one.’ In all cases
where a tribunal has found the application of an umbrella clause inadmissible
based on this ground, it did so because of an explicit exclusive forum selection
clause. The sole example cited by Respondent, SGS v. Philippines, is one such
case. In SGS, the tribunal emphasized the effect of the exclusive choice of the
forum clause and based its decision on the existence thereof. '°° Respondent's
reliance on SGS v. Philippines and its related objection to the application of the
umbrella clause is baseless, as there is no similar clause in the Settlement
Agreement that would dictate a similar outcome.

IV. “Pure” contract breach

24

The Settlement Agreement is valid under international law, under international
law principles of intra vires or apparent authority. The ILC Articles set out a
general principle of international law in Article 4:

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial
or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the
State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of
a territorial unit of the State.

. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance
with the internal law of the State.

N

244. The language adopted by the ILC in this provision clearly indicates that this is a
general rule on attribution of conduct. This approach is confirmed by
jurisprudence and the practice of international investment tribunals. °°

245. The same rule applies when State organs act in excess of authority or in
contradiction of instructions. Under international law, the conduct of those State
organs would still be attributable to the State. This rule is embodied in Article 7 of
the ILC Articles.

246. The question to ask when examining a specific ultra vires act by a State
organ/entity or official is whether the conduct has been carried out by a person
“in an apparently official capacity” 197, or “under colour of authority’’®® or “with
apparent authority”.1°9 “Apparent authority” is defined as a situation when a State
in question gives the “impression or allow(s) the impression reasonably to arise,
that the particular acts or omissions were within the authority of the body or
person”,200

247. Investment tribunals consistently accept that States may not escape from their
obligations under the pretext of the absence of authority for its organs and agents.

248. As discussed at length in the expert legal opinions,?°' and in the witness
statements of Mssrs. Giinay and Hasasu, Ministry of Finance officials at all times
represented to Claimant representatives that they had the authority to enter into
the Settlement Agreement and that the Settlement Agreement was binding on
Libya. The State Litigation Department made this very representation in a letter
dated 7 May 2013, which referred the matter to the Deputy Minister of the Ministry
of Finance to approve settlement with Claimant and pay Libya’s contractual
obligations.?° It repeated that representation in a letter dated 29 July 2013.2 |

249. In conclusion, the Settlement Agreement is binding on Respondent under
principles of international law for much the same reason it is binding under Libyan
law.

The fair and equitable treatment standard is informed by the concept of legitimate
expectations. These expectations provide a degree of stability around the key
parameters of an investment when an investor is deciding whether or how to
invest. This is the principled basis for there being any protection of expectations
within the FET standard at all. It explains both why only certain expectations can
be protected as ‘legitimate expectations’, and why those expectations must be
legitimate to attract protection.2o

. Unless an expectation affects an investor's decision to invest — i.e., whether to

make a contribution, of a certain duration, that is subject to
operational/investment risk — the expectation cannot be relied upon by the
investor, and is not internationally protected. Only a specific, precise and
unambiguous expectation, which is derived from a representation by State
officials, can be said to contribute to an investor’s decision to invest, or be relied
upon by an investor in making its investment.2°5

. Only expectations which arose before an investment is made can be legally

 

protected ‘legitimate expectations’. This has been widely recognised by
international tribunals. This is because only expectations which arose before an
investment can be relied upon by an investor in making its investment.2°°

. Moreover, only legitimate expectations are internationally protected. Whether

legitimate expectations exist, and if so their content, is an objective question. An
investor's subjective expectations are irrelevant. The general economic and
political conditions of a State and its overall circumstances can be expected to
inform a prudent investor's assessment and acceptance of business risk. While
the post-Uprising Libyan economy offered opportunities, these opportunities
existed in what remained an emerging economy with a newly (re)created
government infrastructure. In this environment, an investor could not have had a
legitimate expectation that its dealings with the new authorities would run as
smoothly as they would in a more stable State.?°”

Further, if Claimant's evidence as to its 20 years of prior dealings with Gaddafi-
era authorities (prior to the entry into force of the BIT) was true, the objective
expectation of an investor in Claimant’s position could only have been that things
would not run smoothly. Claimant, like any investor or potential investor, needed
to make a realistic assessment of the situation. To the extent that Claimant failed
to carry out a realistic assessment or to undertake due diligence, it cannot use
international law as an insurance policy against its own shortcomings.2°8

255. Finally, Claimant's cited legitimate expectations are not protected. Claimant does
not assert that any specific, precise and unambiguous expectation, derived from
a representation by State officials, contributed to its ‘investment’. Nor does it
allege any change, much less an internationally wrongful change, to the
regulatory framework in Libya. It relies exclusively on three purported
‘expectations’: (i) alleged contractual obligations in the Settlement Agreement; (ii)
an “expectation that [Libya] would comply with a specific representation to settle
a state debt’; and (iii) “on a general level...that Libya would abide by its own laws
and would comply with any decision issued by Libyan Courts”.?°9

256. As to the first ‘expectation’ (at (i) above), contractual obligations are not
internationally protected ‘legitimate expectations’, and a simple breach of contract
by the State cannot amount to a violation of legitimate expectations protected by
the BIT. The existence of legitimate expectations and contractual rights are two
separate issues.

257. As to the second ‘expectation’ (at (ii) above), Claimant has not suggested any
specific, extra-contractual basis for such an expectation. Indeed, Claimant's
reference to the agreement being “affirmed by a significant part of its
administration” appears to rely on how the Settlement Agreement was allegedly
treated after it was signed by Claimant, which cannot have created any
expectation before it was signed

@

Even if such an expectation had been alleged and was proved, the function of
‘legitimate expectations’ is not to elevate contractual obligations under domestic
law to international obligations under the BIT and international law.

As to the third ‘expectation’ (at (ili) above), Claimant has not alleged, much less
shown, any basis for a specific expectation that “Libya would abide by its own
laws and would comply with any decision issued by Libyan Courts”. Moreover,
such ‘expectation’ is not protected as a legitimate expectation under international
law.

Fair and Equitable Treatment - Denial of Justice

260. Even if it is found that the Settlement Agreement is valid and binding, the Ministry
of Finance’s non-compliance with the Settlement Agreement is, at most, a failure
to abide by a contract. That is not a denial of justice. A denial of justice claim
arises, in case of failure to obtain redress through the domestic legal system. This
supposes that the investor has sought to obtain redress through that judicial

redress through the judicial system, Claimant initiated international arbitration
claiming a denial of justice. But Claimant has not tested the judicial system in
order to seek enforcement of the agreement - a prerequisite for such an action.2"1

then there is no agreement between the parties regarding the Court Decision.
The Court Decision is not enforceable, pending the decision of the Beida Court
of Appeal on the ongoing appeal.

Furthermore, in its Reply, Claimant included a new denial of justice claim, based
on the Appeal process. These allegations are ill-founded. The Beida Court of
Appeal proceedings contain no irregularities and the Beida Court of Appeal
Decision was in fact correct under Libyan law. In any event and crucially, this
Tribunal does not sit as an appellate court, and even the sum of Claimant's
expert's criticisms (even if they were well-founded) would not reach the threshold
for a denial of justice. Finally, Claimant has made no attempt to exhaust the
remedies available within the Libyan court system, noticeably an appeal of the
Beida Court of Appeal Decision.?'2

The Appeal proceedings have been conducted in accordance with Libyan law,
with a clear record of its procedural history. That history does not disclose any
procedural inadequacy, much less issues rising to the level of a denial of
justice.2*5

Claimant's claims are, in effect, simply that the Beida Court of Appeal got Libyan
law wrong. Claimant asserts (i) that the Beida Court of Appeal Decision is
contrary to another decision of that Court, (ii) that the Decision should have
contained more procedural detail, (iii) that an appeal decision cannot be rendered
without the original case file, and (iv) that a Court cannot query a statement of a
private process server without staying proceedings, reporting an alleged crime to

system, and that its attempt has failed because of the internationally wrongful
failings of that judicial system.?1°

Instead of seeking to enforce that Settlement Agreement in Libya, and obtain
redress through the judicial system, Claimant initiated international arbitration
claiming a denial of justice. But Claimant has not tested the judicial system in
order to seek enforcement of the agreement - a prerequisite for such an action.2"

Conversely, if the Settlement Agreement is not a valid and binding agreement,
then there is no agreement between the parties regarding the Court Decision.
The Court Decision is not enforceable, pending the decision of the Beida Court
of Appeal on the ongoing appeal.

Furthermore, in its Reply, Claimant included a new denial of justice claim, based
on the Appeal process. These allegations are ill-founded. The Beida Court of
Appeal proceedings contain no irregularities and the Beida Court of Appeal
Decision was in fact correct under Libyan law. In any event and crucially, this
Tribunal does not sit as an appellate court, and even the sum of Claimant's
expert's criticisms (even if they were well-founded) would not reach the threshold
for a denial of justice. Finally, Claimant has made no attempt to exhaust the
remedies available within the Libyan court system, noticeably an appeal of the
Beida Court of Appeal Decision.?'2

The Appeal proceedings have been conducted in accordance with Libyan law,
with a clear record of its procedural history. That history does not disclose any
procedural inadequacy, much less issues rising to the level of a denial of
justice.2'5

Claimant's claims are, in effect, simply that the Beida Court of Appeal got Libyan
law wrong. Claimant asserts (i) that the Beida Court of Appeal Decision is
contrary to another decision of that Court, (ii) that the Decision should have
contained more procedural detail, (iii) that an appeal decision cannot be rendered
without the original case file, and (iv) that a Court cannot query a statement of a
private process server without staying proceedings, reporting an alleged crime to
prosecutors, and awaiting the process server's trial.2’* Even if it were a relevant
question for this Tribunal to determine (which it is not), Claimant has not shown
that the Beida Court of Appeal got Libyan law wrong.

reasonable degree of regulatory flexibility, and a tribunal will not substitute its own
judgment on whether a measure or policy was appropriate; only whether it was
arbitrary.2?° This imposes a high standard on a claimant seeking to establish such
arbitrariness.

27

=

- Acontractual breach will not, of itself, amount to arbitrary conduct." In any event
and however these elements of the FET standard are defined, Libya has not
breached the FET standard.

272. Claimant's claims under this head relate to (i) an alleged change or inconsistency
in position between other State bodies and the State Litigation Department, (ii)
asserting legal arguments said to be contrary to Libyan law, and (iii)
“maltreatment” which “extends back decades’.

273. As to (i) (an alleged change or inconsistency in position), State organs adopting
an inconsistent position of itself is not a breach of the FET standard. This is
especially the case where the ‘inconsistent’ acts are sequential. What has been
criticised by some tribunals, and what in appropriate cases might amount to a
breach of the FET standard, is where a State simultaneously imposes different
and inconsistent requirements on an investor, and does not provide a mechanism
to resolve the apparent inconsistency. That is not the case here. Claimant's case
is that, based solely on dealings with a small number of individuals with the
Ministry of Finance legal department and undisclosed representatives of “the
budget office”, in 2013-2014, ‘Libya’ adopted a position that the Settlement
Agreement was binding, and then reversed that position in this arbitration.222

27.

+

This arbitration was Claimant's first attempt to enforce obligations in the
Settlement Agreement. Accordingly, Libya’s consistent position, from Claimant's
first attempt to enforce its alleged legal rights, has been to deny that the
Settlement Agreement is binding. Even assuming the testimony of Messrs Giinay
and Hasasu were true and complete, it is unsurprising — and certainly not a
breach of the FET standard — that a State’s legal department may take a different
view of the legal effect of conduct of individual government officials than those
Officials themselves. In any event, Claimant has not proffered any evidence that
it relied on the alleged representations of the individuals Claimant referred to.

275. Furthermore, Claimant has had (and continues to have) every opportunity to
participate in the Tripoli Proceedings, in which the State Litigation Department
requests a declaration on the validity and effect of the Settlement Agreement
under Libyan law. Claimant was served with those proceedings in accordance
with Libyan civil procedure rules,?* and then received extra and extraordinary

notice of those proceedings through its counsel in this arbitration. Whether it
chooses to take the opportunity to participate is outside Respondent's control.

27

>

As to (ii) (asserting legal arguments said to be contrary to Libyan law), the
Denfarm case, the only authority referenced by Claimant, does not have the legal
effect asserted by Claimant, and, in any event, is presently under appeal. In any
event, Claimant cannot be suggesting that it is a breach of the FET standard for
government lawyers to advance legal arguments, on behalf of State entities,
which are inconsistent with a single finding of an intermediate domestic court (the
Beida Court of Appeal in the Denfarm case), in circumstances where such finding
is challenged as being wrong in law.224

27

a

. As to (iii), Claimant asks the Tribunal to consider that Libya has “created great
legal and administrative barriers to Claimant’s attempts to collect what was due”,
by reference to witness evidence concerning Claimant’s attempts to collect
receivables from 1991-2007. The Libya-Turkey BIT (allegedly) came into force
only in 2011, and as explained above, the principle of non-retroactivity means
that the BIT’s provisions do not apply to acts which took place before its entry into
force. Respondent could not breach an obligation under the BIT that did not
exist.225

“Contractual violations” as FET breach

278. A State can only be deemed to have breached the FET provision of the applicable
BIT if, in breaching a contract, it acted as a puissance publique (sovereign
authority) in a way not contemplated by the contract. The requirement of
puissance publique has been recognised by numerous tribunals.?26

279. Claimant advances two positions — first, that a simple violation of contractual
obligations may constitute a breach of the FET standard; and secondly, that
Libya’s contract breaches “cannot be reduced to a simple breach of contract’.

280. In support of its first argument, Claimant cites a single authority, Noble Ventures
v. Romania, from which it quotes part of a paragraph:

 

“Considering the place of the fair and equitable treatment standard at the
very beginning of Art. II(2), one can consider this to be a more general standard
which finds its specific application in inter alia the duty to provide full protection
and security, the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory measures and the

obligation _to observe contractual obligations towards the investor. As

demonstrated above, none of those obligations or standards has been
breached. While this in itself cannot lead to the conclusion that the more general
fair and equitable treatment standard has not been breached, it remains difficult
to see how the judicial proceedings can be regarded as a violation of Art. II(2)(a)
of the BIT [...]’?2” (Claimant’s partial quote underlined, Respondent's emphasis
in bold).

Read beyond Claimant's partial quote indicates that (i) the tribunal was not in
fact interpreting the FET standard in isolation but Article !1(2) of the US-Romania
BIT, an article which also includes, with the FET standard, the ‘FPS’, ‘non-
impairment’ and ‘umbrella clause’ obligations referenced by the tribunal;?2° and
(ii) the tribunal found that none of those obligations (including the obligation to
observe contractual obligations) was breached. This case — the only one cited by
Claimant for this proposition — is not authority that a contractual breach can, much
less will, amount to a breach of the FET standard.

. The remainder of the cases cited by Claimant relate to its subsidiary argument —
that a breach of contract may amount to a breach of the FET standard if it involves
something more — for example, a repudiation of the contract, or an abuse of right
by the State.?29

28:

Where a breach of contract is caused by a State acting as a puissance publique
(sovereign authority) in a way not contemplated by the contract, that can give rise
to a breach of the FET standard. However, what is sanctioned as a breach of the
FET standard is not the breach of contract, but the State’s wrongful exercise of
sovereign power. This explains the remarks by other tribunals which Claimant
cites.

28

2

284. The facts of this case are nothing like those in the cases involving FET breaches
cited by Claimant. Respondent has not exercised sovereign power — such as the
passage of expropriatory legislation — to pursue its purported legal rights.29° Nor
has it abusively exercised its purported contractual rights, working in conjunction
with other State agencies and in defiance of court orders, to attack Claimant's
operations.?*1 In all those cases, while there was a contractual context, it was the
State’s extra-contractual conduct, and exercise of sovereign power, that was held
to be the breach of the FET standard.?°?

. Claimant's ‘contractual breach’ claim does not involve any such sovereign power.

ll. Expropriation

Respondent has not expropriated Claimant’s investment. Claimant argues that
Respondent has expropriated its investment by failing to comply with the
Settlement Agreement. Respondent submits that its non-compliance with this
instrument could not amount to an expropriation.

First, the Settlement Agreement, in itself, is not an investment under the BIT, and
therefore it cannot be expropriated. Furthermore, Claimant has not shown that
the Settlement Agreement is connected with any underlying investment. Even if
contrary to Respondent’s arguments the Arbitral Tribunal were to find that this
instrument was connected with an underlying investment, Claimant would have
to show that this underlying investment was expropriated — which Claimant has
not attempted to do, as it has not tried to substantiate any link between this
instrument and an alleged underlying investment.2%°

Secondly, even if the Agreement were an investment capable of being
expropriated, Libya acted only as any private party could have in the
circumstances, and has not had recourse to puissance publique (sovereign
authority) in its dealings with Claimant.

Thirdly, in itself, Libya’s non-compliance with the Settlement Agreement cannot
in any event amount to an expropriation, since non-compliance with contractual
obligations is an omission that does not subject investments to a measure.

Finally, any alleged debt resulting from the Settlement Agreement has not been
expropriated or ‘taken’ in any way; Claimant can still seek to enforce any rights it
says it has in the Libyan courts.

. As for Claimant's argument that Respondent has expropriated Claimant's
investment through ‘repudiation’, Respondent argues that a contractual breach
by the State does not take or destroy the investment.254

Claimant also argues that expropriation can occur when it is committed through
“state action”. Based on Claimant's pleaded examples of what it labels ‘state
action’, which seems to refer to any conduct of State entities whatever its nature,
it is hard to conceive of any breach of contract by a State that would not involve
‘state action’ according to Claimant's interpretation. Accordingly, based on
Claimant's own analysis, this cannot serve as a distinguishing factor either.2°5

293. Regardless of which descriptive label Claimant seeks to apply, the point is that
Respondent has not taken or destroyed Claimant's alleged investment. Rather,
there is disagreement that any amount is payable to Claimant under the
Settlement Agreement as a matter of Libyan law. If that is incorrect, the
Ministry’s non-payment would have been in breach of a Libyan law contract.
This would not however be an extraordinary breach or a ‘repudiation’ of an
investment, but an ordinary incident of a contractual dispute, in which the justice
system of the State is open to the investor. However analysed, that is not an
expropriation. If it were, then any difference in legal opinion on the validity or
effect of a contract by any State could be an ‘expropriation’.

294. Also, concerning Respondent's alleged use of ‘sovereign means’ or ‘sovereign
authority’ to expropriate the investment, Claimant has confused the mere
involvement of the State, with a State acting in its sovereign capacity through acts
of puissance publique (sovereign authority). Similarly, the pursuit by a State
organ or other entity of ‘State interests’ and ‘State objectives’ does not mean that
the acts in question necessarily involve the exercise of sovereign means or
sovereign authority. A breach of contract, per se, even if one had occurred (which
is denied), would not involve the exercise of either.?°>

295. To illustrate, while Claimant refers to Libya acting through its State lawyers,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and State Budget Office; all the
actions complained of, from the negotiating of agreements to the content of the
legal argument presented, could have been performed by a hypothetical ordinary
company and its various departments.?5”

296. Thus, while a State could in principle destroy the value of a right which had it
origins in a contract through acts of puissance publique (sovereign authority), no
such acts are alleged here.

{ll Umbrella Clause

297. Article 3 of the BIT does not entitle Claimant to import into the BIT the ‘umbrell
clause’ in the Austria-Libya BIT.

298. The interpretation of MFN clauses is a contested and controversial issue of t
interpretation. There is no jurisprudence constante (established case law.
is in part because there is no single standard MFN clause, but rather a rang
provisions that provide for a kind of ‘MFN treatment’ which must be interpr
on a BIT-by-BIT basis. 5

299. This Arbitral Tribunal’s task is to interpret Articles 3(2) and 3(3) in the Turkey-
Libya BIT. The Arbitral Tribunal must approach its task in accordance with the
established rules on treaty interpretation under international law. While some past
awards may provide useful guidance in this task, such awards do not replace the
interpretative process itself.2*

300.

The interpretation of treaty provisions is a single and unified process of
interpretation. However, Claimant's claims can usefully be considered through
three points of reference:?°9

MEN clauses, absent special wording, do not operate to ‘import’ provisions
contained in treaties with third States. MFN clauses contain a promise of
substantive treatment. However, MFN clauses in investment treaties have
also been regarded by some tribunals and scholars as having another role:
to ‘import’ more favourable provisions from third treaties into the basic
treaty. How this ‘importation’ into the basic treaty is said to occur has not
been explained satisfactorily in any of the authorities cited by Claimant.

Articles 3(2) and 3(3) of the BIT do not provide for the import of provisions
from other treaties. There is no single MFN clause or form of MFN
treatment, and each clause must be interpreted on its own terms. Articles
3(2) and 3(3) of the BIT contain three separate indications that the articles
do not operate to import provisions from treaties with third States. First,
Articles 3(2) and 3(3) apply to each State only “in its territory”. Secondly,
Articles 3(2) and 3(3) provide that “Neither Contracting Party shall subject
investors’ or “[...] subject investments” to treatment less favourable than it
accords to investors or investments from any third State. This is prohibitory
language, rather than a promise of treatment. Thirdly, each of Article 3(2)
and Article 3(3) provides a single, unified protection regarding both most-
favoured-nation and national treatment. There can be no question of a
national treatment protection operating to ‘import’ other treaty provisions.

In any event, Articles 3(2) and 3(3) of the BIT do not provide for the import
of protections not contained within the basic treaty. To the extent the
Arbitral Tribunal considers that Articles 3(2) and 3(3) have an ‘import’
function, there are further reasons why any such importing should be
limited to importing (i) more favourable versions of protections included
within the basic treaty, if and when (ii) such protections are incorporated
into new/future treaties.

301. A breach of contract does not automatically result in breach of an umbrella
clause. First, an umbrella clause does not override the jurisdiction of domestic
courts over contractual disputes, and Claimant’s claims should therefore be
rejected on admissibility grounds because the Settlement Agreement is subject
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Libyan Courts. Secondly, an umbrella clause
extends only to contracts entered into in the exercise of sovereign authority, and
Claimant has failed to show that the Settlement Agreement was entered into by
Libya as a sovereign. Finally, an umbrella clause only protects contractual
obligations that only a State can undertake.?4°

IV. “Pure” contract breach

As referred to above, Claimant does not dispute that the Settlement Agreement
is governed by Libyan law and that this must extend to any issues raised as to its
validity. Claimant however invites the Arbitral Tribunal effectively to ignore Libyan
law and to instead find the Settlement Agreement “enforceable under
international law principles of ultra vires or apparent authority”. It relies for this
purpose on the rules governing the attribution of conduct for the purposes of State
responsibility, under the ILC Articles.

30

N

303. In Respondent's view, Claimant’s argument is misconceived for at least two
reasons.

304. First, the issue as to whether the Settlement Agreement is valid must be governed
exclusively by Libyan law. It is absurd to suggest that a contract which is found
not to be valid or binding under its undisputed governing law can somehow
become ‘valid’ under a different law.?41

30:

a

Secondly, in any event, even if international law had any bearing on this issue
(which is denied), the rules governing attribution for the purpose of State
responsibility have nothing to do with the formation or interpretation of a
contract.242

. As explained in Article 2 of the ILC Articles, for State responsibility to arise, an :
act or omission at issue must (a) be attributable to the State under international
law, and (b) constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State. The —
question of whether conduct that might breach an international obligation is
attributable to the State is completely distinct from questions concerning the
existence or interpretation of the international obligation at issue. Chapter II of the

Case 1:22-cv-00864 Document 1-4 Filed 0
FINAL AWARD ICC Arbitration 22236/ZF/AYZ

ILC Articles applies to the attribution of conduct; not to the creation of new
international obligations.?43

307. The distinction is made clear by Professor Crawford, the Special Rapporteur on
the ILC Articles, in an article exhibited by Claimant:

‘It is sometimes argued that the question is one of attribution under Chapter 2 of
Part | of the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility, but attribution has nothing to
do with it. The issue of attribution arises when it is sought to hold the state
responsible for some breach of an international obligation, including one arising
under a substantive provision of a BIT’24+

30.

=

Accordingly, the rules of attribution under international law do not concern the
creation of international obligations, and certainly not the creation of contractual
obligations between a State ministry and a foreign company, and in any event
cannot and do not alter the undisputed governing law of a contract.

D. THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONS

309. Claimant has advanced claims based on several different provisions of the BIT.
The Parties have not requested that the different claims be dealt with in any
particular order. Under these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal may assess the
claims in the order it sees fit, and need only assess such claims as it deems
sufficient to resolve the core question of liability (and if so, damages) or absence
of liability. In the interest of judicial economy, the Arbitral Tribunal begins with its
analysis of the claims based on the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article
2(2) of the BIT.

31

S

As will be developed below, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed
to accord Claimant's investment fair and equitable treatment. This being the case,
the Arbitral Tribunal need not and will not examine any other alleged violations of
the BIT, in particular since Claimant has not argued that the calculation of the
damages claimed would change in the event that other treaty breaches were also
found.

31

- Nor will the Arbitral Tribunal assess any claims presented solely on contractual
grounds, as discussed at para. 188. The damages claimed on contractual
grounds are in any event lower than those claimed on treaty-based grounds.

International (1 September 2008), p. 363. Professor Crawford’s remarks are in the context of attempts

State itself as a contract by the State; he states that rules of attribution cannot create or alter a State’s
international obligations.

312. At the outset, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that it has taken cognizance of the
difficult circumstances in Libya. In particular during 2011 and the following years,
the State was afflicted by violence, upheaval and generally dire circumstances
for the administration of public justice. The Arbitral Tribunal recognizes and has
made allowances for the challenges involved in properly managing a State under
these circumstances.

|. Legitimate Expectations

313. For the reasons set out below, the Arbitral Tribunal nevertheless finds that
Respondent has violated Claimant's legitimate expectation with respect to the
specific representations made prior to the conclusion of, and enshrined in, the
Settlement Agreement.

The Arbitral Tribunal has found above, at paras. 154-167, that the Settlement
Agreement constitutes a claim to money related to an underlying historical
“investment,” which claim itself constitutes an “investment” within the meaning of
Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT. The investment with which Claimant's legitimate
expectations are associated is thus the Settlement Agreement. In order to
determine the scope of these expectations, the Arbitral Tribunal must examine
which expectations Claimant had at the time when the Settlement Agreement
was concluded.?45

314.

zB

Respondent's conduct during the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of the
Settlement Agreement in December 2013, as well as the Settlement Agreement
itself, constitute specific representations with which Claimant legitimately could
expect Respondent to comply.

31

a

The initial suggestion to try to settle the claims owed under the Court Decision
emanates from discussions between the Derna branch of the State Litigation
Department (which is part of the Ministry of Justice) and Claimant’s lawyer, Mr.
Elshelwy. The record shows that the first letter mentioning the potential of a
settlement was sent from Mr. Elshelwy to the State Litigation Department, but Mr.
Ginay recalls that this letter was sent after the State Litigation Department had
informally proposed that Claimant send such a letter.746

31

2

The State Litigation Department then initiated the settlement discussions by
sending an internal letter to the Deputy Minister of Finance.”47 Following this —
letter, it was the Ministry of Finance that conducted the negotiations with
Claimant’s representatives Mr. Giinay and Mr. Hasasu.

317.

qq

245 Respondent has itself argued that the expectations must arise when the investor made its
investment. In making this point, Respondent relied on the Teinver v. Argentina award as authority.

318. In order to negotiate the Settlement Agreement, Claimant’s representatives
participated in several meetings with officials at the Ministry of Finance in 2013.
During these meetings, representations were made by different officials
concerning what was expected in order for the State to agree to a settlement.

319. Mr. El Velid at the Ministry of Finance's legal department suggested to Claimant's
representatives Mr. Giinay and Mr. Hasasu that Claimant propose terms for a
settlement, in order to initiate the negotiations.2“8 Mr. Guinay has recounted that
Mr. El Velid expressly said that a discount from the amounts awarded by the
Court Decision was expected.749

320. Following this suggestion from Mr. El Velid, Claimant's representatives submitted
a first settlement offer to the Ministry of Finance, which proposed a 5% discount
on the receivables owed under the Court Decision. Based on this offer from
Claimant's representatives, Mr. El Velid prepared a first draft of an agreement.?5°

32

=>

. At a later meeting during the negotiations, Claimant's representatives met with
Mr. Tarik, the head of the Ministry of Finance’s legal department. He told
Claimant's representatives that the 5% discount from the first draft would not be
accepted, and insisted that Claimant offer a higher discount.251 Upon this
suggestion, Claimant's representatives offered the 10% discount, which was
ultimately included in an updated draft agreement.?>2

322. The updated draft version of the Settlement Agreement also provided for payment
in two instalments at different dates in 2014, rather than immediately upon
execution of the Agreement.?5° Mr. Tarik explained to Mr. Ginay that the
instalments were necessary in order for Claimant to receive its money, because
the budget for 2013 had already been exhausted.?54

323. In the final version of the Settlement Agreement, Respondent's representations
were very specific: Respondent undertook to pay Claimant LD 5,420,308.707,
spread out over two instalments at two different dates in 2014,7°° Both Parties
also undertook to abandon “any domestic or international court litigation,
application for enforcement abroad, or any court or administrative liens, whether
international or domestic, in relation to the ruling subject hereof".256

324. Thus, the final version of the Settlement Agreement is the result of negotiations,
in which two different officials at the Ministry of Finance suggested specific
provisions concerning the sums owed, and the structure of their payment. The
Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Claimant justifiably relied on these suggestions,

Subsequent to the signing of the Settlement Agreement, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs assisted Claimant in obtaining the signature samples needed to verify the
authenticity of the Settlement Agreement for international recognition.7°”

Respondent was under no obligation to enter into the Settlement Agreement in
the first place. On the contrary, it could have chosen to challenge the Court
Decision rather than settle the claims enshrined therein.

In this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal recognizes that the Court Decision was
rendered in absentia, which Respondent has pointed out as one of the reasons
for its Appeal. The reason for Respondent's absence, as well as its
consequences, are disputed by the Parties. Respondent has argued that it was
never notified of the proceedings leading up to the Court Decision, and has relied
on this fact as one of the grounds for its Appeal.75*

However, Claimant has furnished contemporaneous evidence that Libyan
Officials did not consider the in absentia decision as necessarily being
problematic. On 7 May 2013, i.e some six months after the Court Decision was
rendered on 29 October 2012, the Director of Legal Proceedings in Derna
informed the Deputy Minister of Finance that the Court Decision could not be
successfully appealed, and should instead be settled:

According to our belief, the decision, although finalized in absentia against the
State of Libya, has been decided justly and based on correct evidence. The
administration delayed the payment of the Plaintiff company’s proven receivables
more than 10 years against the conditions of contract. This resulted the basis of
the decision [SIC] of payment to the benefit of the company, the main receivables
and the compensation.

The Court Decision has been forwarded to our branch, and although we have
taken decision to appeal the decision at the Cebel Ahtar Appeals Court (Derna),
there are no serious reasons for Appeals Court to change or alter the decision of
the Beida Primary Court, and the decision of the Appeals Court will most likely
finalize to the benefit of the Plaintiff company.

Therefore, | would like to notify and request approval from the Deputy Minister of
Finance, to settle and consolidate the receivables with the company.©9

As already noted, Respondent subsequently decided to settle with Claimant
rather than challenge the claims in the Court Decision. Despite this decision, and

the associated representations to that effect reflected in the Settlement
Agreement, Respondent thereafter proceeded with its Appeal.

330. The exact circumstances and timing of Respondent's appeal of the Court
Decision have not been established during this Arbitration. However, during the
settlement negotiations in 2013, officials at the Ministry of Finance assured
Claimant's representatives that the Appeal would be abandoned.?©° As already
mentioned, the Settlement Agreement also ultimately included a provision by
which both Parties undertook to refrain from any litigation concerning the subject
of the dispute. Article 7 of the Settlement Agreement provides that “[aJny domestic
or international court litigation, application in Sul eatna abroad, or any court
or ative liens, ic, in relation to the ruling
subject hereof, shall be abandoned”.

 

 

33

. Mr. Giinay was assured that a copy of the Settlement Agreement would be sent
from the Ministry of Finance to the State Litigation Department, which would then
abandon the appeal in accordance with the Agreement.?51

332. There is nothing in the record of this Arbitration that casts any light on what
transpired in the Appeal during the time between the conclusion of the Settlement
Agreement in December 2013 and the initiation of this Arbitration in August 2016.
Mr. Ginay has stated that he assumed that the Appeal was abandoned, in line
with what was represented by Ministry of Finance officials and in line with what
was included in the Settlement Agreement.

333. However, during this Arbitration, it became clear in September 2017 that the
Appeal was still pending in the Beida Court of Appeal. In a letter to Claimant's
counsel on 13 September 2017, Respondent's counsel indicated that a hearing
was scheduled to take place in the Appeal on 3 October 2017. According to Mr.
Giinay, this was the first time Claimant received any information suggesting that
the Appeal had not been abandoned as required by the Settlement Agreement.
The September 2017 letter prompted Claimant's Request for Interim Measures,
in which it asked the Arbitral Tribunal to order Respondent to suspend the Appeal,
or alternatively to ask the Libyan Court to stay the Appeal pending the outcome
of this Arbitration.752

334. It seems to be undisputed that Respondent has not complied with its obligations
under the Settlement Agreement.7®? Under Article 3 of the Agreement,
Respondent undertook to pay two different specified sums in two different
instalments, and under Article 7, both Parties undertook to abandon any litigation
relating to the subject matter of the Agreement. No money has been paid to
Claimant, and Respondent has pursued court litigation in the Appeal, despite
agreeing to abstain from doing so. Respondent has therefore frustrated
Claimant's legitimate expectations that the representations and undertakings
included in the Settlement Agreement would be respected.

ll. Non-Performance of the Settlement Agreement

335. In addition to the frustration of Claimant's legitimate expectations, in the Arbitral
Tribunal’s view, Respondent has also breached the fair and equitable treatment
standard through its non-performance of the Settlement Agreement.

336. The Arbitral Tribunal shares Respondent's view that not every breach of contract
by a State violates the fair and equitable treatment standard.2®* However, the
Settlement Agreement is different from a commercial agreement. It put an end to
a relationship fraught with conflict between a foreign investor and the host State.
In this respect, the facts in this Arbitration are similar to those in Teinver v.
Argentina discussed by both Parties.265

33

x

. In Teinver, the contract in question was a share purchase agreement, by which
the State acquired the shares in two domestic airlines from the investor. In
distinguishing the agreement from a commercial contract, the Teinver tribunal
pointed out that the agreement was signed and ratified by the Argentine
government.” Furthermore, the tribunal found that the purpose of the agreement
was to fulfil a public obligation, viz. to ensure the provision and continuity of fair
transportation services in the country.?67 The tribunal also emphasized that the
share purchase agreement “was intended to put an end to the long and difficult
relationship” between Respondent and the foreign investors, which had preceded
the agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal finds the Teinver tribunal’s analysis to be
instructive, in particular as it concerns the State’s intention to put an end to a long
dispute by way of a formalized agreement.

33)

@

In the present case, Claimant had spent considerable time and effort trying to
collect on money owed to it by Libyan public authorities as compensation for
Claimant’s investment in public works projects in Libya. Eventually, these efforts
led to the Court Decision, in which a Libyan court recognized the debts owed to
Claimant.

33:

o

. When it became clear to Claimant’s representatives that Respondent would not
pay the sums awarded by the Court Decision, Claimant entered into negotiations
to conclude the Settlement Agreement. As described above at paras. 315-330,
both during the negotiations and thereafter, various Libyan officials represented
to Claimant that the Settlement Agreement would be respected, which would
ultimately lead to Claimant receiving the receivables owed to it under the
Settlement Agreement.

34

o

. Against this background, the Settlement Agreement is different from a
“commercial” agreement. The Settlement Agreement was negotiated and drafted
by Libyan public officials at both the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry o}
Finance. It was then approved for the purposes of international recognition by th
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisted by the Ministry of Finance. The purpose oj
the Agreement was not commercial, but rather to end a long-running dispute with

Claimant, by settling a state debt. For these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds
that a breach of the Settlement Agreement is sufficient to generate responsibility
under the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT.

34

=

. Respondent has objected that it is pursuing an invalidation of the Settlement
Agreement in the pending Tripoli Proceedings,7©* arguing that Respondent
cannot be held liable for non-compliance with an agreement it views as invalid.
In Respondent's view, the Settlement Agreement, as well as a number of similar
agreements also entered into by Deputy Minister Ghaith Suleiman in 2012-2013,
are null and void under Libyan law.

34

XN

This objection is not convincing. The Tripoli Proceedings were initiated on 25
March 2018, more than a year and half after the initiation of this Arbitration.76°
Respondent cannot excuse its continuing non-performance of a contract entered
into in 2013 with a reference to its effort to invalidate that contract in 2018.
Furthermore, as discussed in paras 124-150, the Arbitral Tribunal has found that
the Settlement Agreement is valid as a matter of Libyan law.

Ill. _Arbitrary and inconsistent conduct

343. Furthermore, under the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(2) of the
BIT, Claimant had the right to expect that Respondent would act consistently and
logically. Respondent has not lived up to these expectations.

344. The sequence of events demonstrates an inconsistent conduct on behalf of
Respondent. During 2013, Respondent engaged in the settlement negotiations,
which ultimately led to the signing of the Settlement Agreement in December
2013. Officials from the Ministry of Finance took an active part in the negotiations
and suggested the inclusion of specific language in order for the Agreement to
be acceptable to the State. This ultimately led Claimant to make certain
concessions, including a 10% discount of the amounts owed, as well as dividing
the payment into separate later instalments. These concessions were made by
Claimant in response to representations by agents of the Respondent that they
were needed to make possible an agreement.?’°

345. In the Agreement, both Parties agreed to abandon “any domestic or international
court litigation, application for enforcement abroad, or any court or administrative
liens, whether international or domestic, in relation to the ruling subject hereof”.2”7
Respondent has nevertheless chosen to pursue the Appeal subsequent to the
conclusion of the Settlement Agreement. In addition, after Claimant's initiation of
this Arbitration, in March 2018, Respondent also initiated the Tripoli Proceedings,
in an effort to nullify the Settlement Agreement.

346. After the Settlement Agreement was signed, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
assisted Claimant in authorizing the Agreement.’ In this process, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs was assisted by the Ministry of Finance, which provided
signature samples.?’3 Such authorization was believed to be necessary in order
for Claimant to have the Settlement Agreement internationally recognized. In
carrying out the authorization Claimant received assistance from two separate
ministries, neither of which gave the impression that the Settlement Agreement
would not be complied with.

347. Furthermore, despite Respondent insisting that the payment of the sums owed
be divided into separate instalments to be paid during 2014 — as opposed to an
immediate single payment — no money has been paid. Respondent induced
Claimant to agree to the instalment scheme under the pretext that payment would
be forthcoming if Claimant consented to it,2’”4 only thereafter to tell Mr. Giinay to
“wait” when he twice visited Libya in 2014.25 Later, in 2015, Claimant sent three
letters asking about the status of the missing payments, but did not receive any
answer from Respondent.2’6

348. Compared to Respondent’s consistent direct and indirect confirmation of the
Settlement Agreement — as manifested both during the negotiations, in the
Agreement itself and in the months after the signing of Agreement — the position
advanced by Respondent in this Arbitration, i.e. that the Settlement Agreement
is invalid, seems to be an afterthought conceived in order to present a defence in
the Arbitration.

349. In sum, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent has acted arbitrarily and
inconsistently, in a manner that violates the fair and equitable treatment standard.

IV. Summary

350. For the above reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent has breached
the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(2) of the BIT. Given this
outcome, based on the widely accepted principle of judicial economy, the Arbitral
Tribunal will not examine whether Respondent also violated the provisions on
expropriation, the umbrella clause in the Austria-Libya BIT, or any contractual
obligations. Instead, the Arbitral Tribunal will now turn its attention to an analysis
of the damages claimed for the breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard.

alternatively, USD 19,768,000.384. Included in both alternative amounts is pre-
award interest, as developed below at paras. 361-363.

N

. In addition, Claimant has asked the Arbitral Tribunal to award moral damages to
Claimant in an amount of no less than USD 3,000,000.

3. Claimant has also requested that the Arbitral Tribunal award Claimant interest
calculated from 29 August 2016 at a rate to be compounded and fixed by the
Arbitral Tribunal. Claimant suggests an annual interest rate of 4% calculated on
a simple basis if the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent has breached the
Settlement Agreement as a matter of contract, or alternatively an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 5%, compounded semi-annually if the Arbitral Tribunal finds that
Respondent has breached the BIT.

4. Respondent has disputed these valuations, but accepted that any awarded
interest should be set at the 4% simple rate specified in the Settlement
Agreement.

5. Below, the Parties’ respective positions concerning the valuation of Claimant's
alleged losses are summarized.

A. CLAIMANT’S POSITION

|. Standard of Compensation

6. Respondent does not dispute that the standard of compensation in this case is,
as established in the Chorzéw Factory judgement, the standard of full
reparation.?’” Claimant thus understands that Respondent accepts the Chorzow
standard.

ll, Valuation of the Investment

7. While the Settlement Agreement creates new rights going forward — the rights
under the Settlement Agreement — it does so after explicitly recognizing the
findings of the Court Decision. Furthermore, Respondent's subsequent
repudiation of the Settlement Agreement constitutes the taking of all such rights
that Respondent had recognized. The Settlement Agreement reflects a lower
value than the Court Decision, a reduction which Claimant accepted only on the
condition that Respondent would make the payments required under the
Settlement Agreement in a timely fashion and that Respondent would abandon
any legal proceedings with respect to the Court Decision. Respondent neither
paid Claimant, nor abandoned the Appeal. Thus, none of the conditions have
been fulfilled.?”8

358. Article 3 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows:

The First Party shall pay the agreed sum after the waiver, a total of LD
5,420,308.707 (Five Million Four Hundred Twenty Thousand Three Hundred
Eight Libyan Dinars and 707 Dirhams) in favor of the Second Party in two
installments, to the account specified by the Second Party, as follows:

- First payment — a sum of LD 2,710,154.354 (Two Million Seven Hundred Ten
Thousand One Hundred Fifty Four Libyan Dinars and 354 Dirhams), payable by
no later than the end of the first quarter of 2014G.

- Second payment — a sum of LD 2,710, 154.354 (Two Million Seven Hundred Ten
Thousand One Hundred Fifty Four Libyan Dinars and 354 Dirhams), payable by
no later than the end of the first half of the coming year, 2014G.279

359. Under Article 4 of the Settlement Agreement, “[i]nterest due on the agreed
amount as specified in Article (3) of this Agreement shall be calculated on each
payment up to the time of actual payment.”

360. Article 5 of the Settlement Agreement provides for the same exchange rate as in
the Court Decision: “The amounts due to the Company as stipulated in Article (3)
of this Agreement shall be transferred to the account of the Company abroad at
an exchange rate against the United States Dollar as prevailing on 29.10.1994,
of LD 0.299332 for 1 United States Dollar, as provided in the said ruling.”28°

36

. Respondent disputes Claimant's calculation of damages under the Settlement
Agreement. Respondent argues that, in calculating the value of the Settlement
Agreement, interest shall accrue on the sums specified in Article 3 after they
became due and not before, as Claimant argues. The text of the Settlement
Agreement does not support this interpretation.

36!

N

. Article 4 of the Settlement Agreement specifically states that the interest shall be
calculated on the “agreed amount as specified in Article (3) of this agreement.”251
It does not link the calculation of interest to any specific dates. Thus, interest
should be calculated from the date of the execution of the Settlement Agreement,
i.e., 9 December 2013.

363. In its Statement of Claim, Claimant, based on the information received from ;
legal expert at the time, utilized a 5% interest rate in its calculations. In his Second

Libyan Law Opinion, Mr. Mukhtar updated his opinion to indicate that the
applicable rate should be 4%. In light of this correction, interest due on the
principal amount would be LYD 228 590,442.395.78? Accordingly, the principal
amount plus interest would be LYD 6,010,751.105.78

36:

B

. Should the Arbitral Tribunal find that interest must be calculated from the payment
dates, the amount of interest on the first payment would be LYD 261,956.83728
and the amount of interest on the second payment would be LYD 234,929.545.78
Consequently, the total amount due as of 29 August 2016, the date of the
Request of Arbitration, comprising the principal amount and interest would be
LYD 5,917,195.091.

365. Respondent also contends that the conversion rate specified in Article 5 of the
Settlement Agreement does not apply to any interest accruing on the settlement
amounts. In Claimant’s view, this contention is incorrect. The provision on the
conversion rate in Article 5 refers to a similar provision in the Court Decision.2®
The conversion rate under the Court Decision applies to all parts of the awarded
amounts, including interest.78” Since the Settlement Agreement is based on the
Court Decision, there is no reason to believe that a different approach should be
followed for the amounts due under the Settlement Agreement. Thus, the
conversion rate specified in Article 5 of the Settlement Agreement must apply to
all amounts due to Claimant.

366. The application of the conversion rate of LYD 0.299332 per USD 1 on the amount
of LYD 6,010,751.105 results in the amount of USD 20,080,549.707. This amount
represents Claimant's valuation of damages under the Settlement Agreement.
Alternatively, the application of the conversion rate on the amount of LYD
5,917,195.091 results in the amount of USD 19,768,000.384. This
amount represents Claimant's alternative valuation of damages under the
Settlement Agreement.

36)

. Finally, Respondent seems to argue that the value of lost rights under the
Settlement Agreement needs to be calculated by taking into consideration
“factors mitigating the liability of the Ministry of Finance under Libyan law or
Libya's liability under international law’ and “Claimant's contribution to any injury

282 The number of days between 9 December 2013 and 29 August 2016 is 994. Thus, the calculation
of the due amount would be as follows: 5,420,308.71 x 0,04 x (994 / 365) = 590,442.395.
283 5,420,308.71 + 590,442.395 = 6,010,751.105.
284 The first instalment of 2,710,154.354 was due on 31 March 2014. The number of days between 31
March 2014 and 29 August 2016 is 882. Thus, the calculation of the due amount would be as follows:
2,710,154.354 x 0,04 x (882 / 365) = 261,956.837.
285 The second instalment of 2,710,154.354 was due on 30 June 2014. The number of days between
30 June 2014 and 29 August 2016 is 791. Thus, the calculation of the due amount would be as
follows: 2,710,154.354 x 0,04 x (791 / 365) = 234,929.545.

suffered including by failing to engage with the competent Libyan courts since the
date of the Court Decision.” This is a statement which Respondent does not
substantiate. In particular, Respondent does not explain what these factors are,
how they should be quantified and how they would affect the valuation.

lll. Moral Damages

368. Respondent argues that the awarding of moral damages in international
arbitration “is far from universally accepted,” especially as regards moral
damages “suffered by corporate claimants.”8° Claimant argues that this

statement is without support.

369. The prevailing jurisprudence allows that moral damages to officers and
employees can be recovered by a corporation. This has been endorsed by legal

scholarship, as well as arbitral tribunals.?®9

Following the approach reflected in the authorities referred to above, this Arbitral
Tribunal must award Claimant moral damages suffered by Claimant's officers and
employees, such as Messrs. Hikmet Ginay, Ziya Giinay and Yilmaz Hasasu, as
a result of deterioration of their health, stress, anxiety and other mental suffering
including humiliation, shame and loss of reputation, credit and social position.
Indeed, such moral damages are an inherent component of the principle of full

370.

oS

reparation.

Further, Respondent contends that a claim for moral damages is outside the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal because such claim is not ‘in connection with”
Claimant's investment.2% This is incorrect. The current practice of investment
tribunals confirms that such tribunals have, as a general matter, jurisdiction to

award compensation for moral damages.?9"

372. Besides, a claim for moral damages in this case arises directly from Claimant's
investment. It is thus a claim that is “in connection with” the investment, and as
such it is within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

373. Respondent next states that an award of moral damages can be warranted only
“in exceptional cases,” which, in Respondent's view, are absent in this case. 292
Claimant disagrees. Although arbitral tribunals generally look for certain criteria
in awarding moral damages, they still exercise a great deal of discretion in doing
so. Besides, a mere reference by tribunals to the “exceptional circumstances”
does not necessarily mean that a high standard for finding a breach of
international law in the context of moral damages claims must be applied

374. In Claimant’s view, the conditions for awarding moral damages are present in this
case. Claimant's claim for moral damages comprises both loss of reputation and
mental suffering of Claimant's executives and employees. It is established in
international law, and undisputed by Respondent, that a loss of reputation may
lead to an award of moral damages. Claimant's deprivation of its investments in
the forms of the Court Decision and the Settlement Agreement resulted in
Claimant's losing the only assets it had and thus paralyzed Claimant's operation
altogether, thereby depriving Claimant of any possibility to conduct any further
business. This resulted in the destruction of Claimant's professional reputation,
both in Libya and in Turkey.

37:

s

The emotional and physical injuries suffered by executives and persons affiliated
with Claimant is another important component of Claimant’s claim for moral
damages. The Court Decision and Settlement Agreement, as investments,
embodied the efforts of such people as Messrs. Hikmet Giinay, Ziya Giinay and
Yilmaz Hasasu over a period of more than 20 years. At great personal expense
and with patience and hard work, they have contributed to establishing Claimant's
investments that have been so blatantly destroyed by Respondent. The level of
frustration, stress and injury to the feelings of these persons as a result of
Respondent’s unlawful actions cannot be overstated.

37

Mr. Ziya Giinay explains in his Second Statement:

Over the last few years, my attempts to get receivables paid by Libyan officials
has become one of the main focuses in my life. Libya’s failure to comply with its
obligations has cost so much to our family and its business that | regard it to be
my mission to take this matter to its conclusion and to receive relief that would
compensate for all the harms done to the Gtinay family’s reputation, its social and
business status, and in particular to the reputation and health of my father, Hikmet
Gunay.?93

377. Mr. Ziya Giinay, together with Mr. Yilmaz Hasasu, travelled to Libya many times
at great personal risk. They went to Libya, a place where no one else would go
at the time, for the sole purpose to pursue high-ranking Libyan officials in charge
of Claimant's case to make them honour Libya's obligations so that Claimant
could finally get back what Respondent unlawfully took from it.

378. As guarantors of all of Claimant's bank loans and bank guarantees, the Giinay
company and Mr. Hikmet Giinay in his personal capacity had to pay huge
amounts due under these loans and guarantees, which was “at great cost to the
Giinay’s own business and the Giinay family estate.”*°* To cover for the
destruction of Claimant's investments, Mr. Hikmet Giinay and Mr. Ziya Giinay
sold a number of property items that belonged to the Giinay family with the total
value of approximately USD 18.5 million.29° When that did not cover all of
Claimant's debts, which arose as a result of Respondent's failure to honour its
obligations under the Court Decision and Settlement Agreement, the Giinay
family members had to sell their shares in the Giinay company. Mr. Ziya Giinay
testifies that had Claimant received the payments under the Settlement
Agreement in a timely fashion, the Ginay family members would have never sold
shares in the Giinay company .?

379. Mr. Hikmet Giinay himself had numerous health problems, and eventually had to
cease working altogether as his life ran into danger as a result of continuous
anxiety, stress and moral suffering.7°”

380. These circumstances amount to an exceptional case that warrants an award of
moral damages. The losses and damages are difficult to quantify but they are as
real as it gets. Claimant submits that the modest — relative to the suffering and
agony of people involved — amount of USD 3,000,000 would compensate for all
moral harms inflicted upon Claimant and persons associated with Claimant as a
result of Respondent's breaches.

IV. Interest Rate

381. In addition to the pre-arbitration interest rate already included in the sums
claimed, Claimant requests that the Arbitral Tribunal order Respondent to pay
additional interest on any sums awarded in this arbitration.

382. If the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent has breached the Settlement
Agreement as a matter of contract, as opposed to as a matter of treaty, the
interest rate should be calculated according to Libyan law. In Claimant's view,
this means an annual interest rate of 4%, calculated on a simple basis.?°

383. In the event that the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent has breached the
BIT, an international interest rate should apply. Claimant proposes an interest
tate of LIBOR plus 5%, compounded semi-annually, as a reflection of the
sovereign credit risk relating to Respondent. Compound interest reflects the
prevalent view in the recent jurisprudence of investment treaty tribunals.?9°

384. Regardless of which rate the Arbitral Tribunal finds applicable, in Claimant’s view
that rate should be applied from the date of the request for arbitration °°

B. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

|. Standard of Compensation

385. The purpose of compensation is to “undo the material harm inflicted by a breach
of an international obligation”*°' Such harm is the actual loss suffered by an
investor, that has been caused by the State’s breach of an international
obligation.*°?

386. In relation to Claimant's expropriation claims, Article 4 of the BIT prescribes the
relevant standard of compensation, being the “market value of the expropriated

investment before the expropriatory action was taken or became known”.

38

_

In relation to Claimant’s non-expropriation treaty claims, the BIT does not contain
an express standard of compensation.

38)

oo

Claimant simply claims that all of the alleged breaches of the BIT by Respondent
“L..] resulted in a single outcome, i.e. the total destruction of [Claimant's]
investments. [Respondent] must provide reparation for [Claimant's] full
deprivation of its investments”.

389. Thus, if Claimant cannot substantiate this allegation, its compensation claims fail
in their entirety. Respondent notes in this regard that tribunals have only been
ready to award compensation for the full loss of investments in respect of
violations of non-expropriatory international legal obligations if the breach has
produced effects equivalent to that of an expropriation.

ll. Valuation of the Investment

390. Claimant’s argument is that the Arbitral Tribunal must award compensation based
on the value of the Settlement Agreement.

. Claimant has calculated damages for loss of the Settlement Agreement based
upon its alleged entitlements under the Settlement Agreement; that is, to put
Claimant in a position as if the Settlement Agreement had been performed. Such
argument can therefore only succeed if the Settlement Agreement were to be
found valid and binding.°%*

. In the event that, despite Respondent’s arguments, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that.
Claimant should be awarded compensation based on the value of the Settlement
Agreement, Respondent comments below on how such loss should be
calculated. z

o

. It is common ground between Claimant and Respondent that the Settleme:
Agreement is a Libyan law-governed document. Article 152(2) of the Libyan Civi
Code provides:

“When a contract has to be construed it is necessary to ascertain the comm
intention of the parties and to go beyond the literal meaning of the words, taki
into account the nature of the transaction as well as that loyalty and confide:
which should exist between the parties in accordance with commerci
usage. 305

394. Furthermore, Article 153(1) of the Libyan Civil Code provides that:

396. Interest on each of the two payments specified in Article 3 of the Settlement
Agreement accrued only from the date that payment fell due. Article 3 provides
for two payments, each of LYD 2,710,154.354, converted at a fixed USD/LYD
tate specified in Article 5, and paid “by no later than” a specified date. It is
unrealistic to suggest that the parties agreed that the Ministry of Finance would
pay two specific USD sums by no later than a given date, and that it would also
pay additional daily interest to accrue at an unspecified rate but which Claimant
now says is 4% p.a.3°8

39

nN

Claimant's interpretation would mean that the Ministry of Finance's contractual
liability would be unknown, and would vary depending on the date when “actual
payment” was made. This is unlikely to have been the parties’ intention in any
contract, and is especially unlikely in circumstances where the Ministry of Finance
was (arguendo) tasked with arranging payment of USD 9 million to a foreign
account, not a straightforward matter for a Libyan government entity in December
2013. Such a payment would need to be arranged well in advance and for a
specific amount, and the date of “actual payment” would be difficult for the
Ministry of Finance to predict.*°°

39:

@

In contrast, Respondent's interpretation is that the parties agreed that if payment
was not made on the due date, interest would, in principle, accrue on the specified
sums. This is a realistic reading of the contractual terms and the parties’ common
intention.2"°

Respondent agrees to the modified arithmetic in para. 389 of Claimant's Reply

Accordingly, the amount due up to 29 August 2016 in accordance with the terms
of the Settlement Agreement is USD 18,108,1016.20°" and LYD 496,886.382.

Ill. Moral Damages

o

. As to the availability of moral damages, Respondent notes that such damages
have only ever been awarded in exceptional circumstances and are not generally
available, especially for corporate claimants.°"? Non-pecuniary loss requires a
non-pecuniary remedy.

404. As to the availability of damages to corporate claimants specifically, as even
Claimant's cited academic Dr Sabahi notes ““[a] strict application of the rules on
standing should prevent awarding compensation for damage to the executives'
personality rights in the latter scenario. Yet, such an approach could cause

practical problems [if claims for ‘moral damages’ cannot be pursued before local
courts] [...] (emphasis added)”.*"4

40

a

. Putting aside whether claims for ‘moral damages’ can ever be used to circumvent
the rules on standing, it is not appropriate for companies to receive extra, non-
compensatory damages, simply because one or more of its directors or
employees is dissatisfied with a failed investment involving breaches of a treaty.
Nor do moral damages exist to provide additional damages in circumstances
where pecuniary loss has been suffered by non-parties to the arbitration and
cannot be proved by the claimant, and/or where such pecuniary loss has a vague
connection with, but is not caused by, the breaches of a treaty.°"5

406. As to the need for exceptional circumstances, Respondent respectfully disagrees
with the view of Dr Dumberry, relied upon by Claimant,3"* whose personal view
that moral damages should be available as a matter of course is not supported
by the survey of awards in his 2010 article, and does not appear to have been
supported in any award in the following eight years. Moral damages are not
designed to compensate for economic/pecuniary loss, and their general
availability for breach of investment treaty protections would be incompatible with
the nature of investment treaties and investment treaty arbitration.

407. The two proceedings in which moral damages have been awarded by
experienced tribunals were characterised by grave and_ exceptional

circumstances.*"7 In the many other cases in which moral damages have been
claimed, they have been rejected.

Finally, Mr Giinay’s witness evidence does not assert, much less prove, any facts
that would give rise to an award of moral damages. Respondent notes that there
is no hint of physical duress to Claimant or its representatives by or on behalf or
Respondent. The pleaded “suffering and agony” bears no relation to the serious
conduct and harm identified in Desert Line and von Pezold. Nor does Mr Giinay’'s
statement provide concrete evidence of the harm asserted.*"8

Moreover, Claimant’s submissions suggest that it is seeking ‘moral damages’ in
respect of conduct which pre-dates the BIT, and accordingly for conduct not in
breach of any obligation under the BIT. In Respondent’s view, this ignores the
principle of non-retroactivity, by asserting that the effects of conduct and events
as much as 20 years prior to the BIT’s entry into force somehow entitle Claimant
to damages under the BIT. Such efforts must fail.9"9

Interest Rate

As to interest after 29 August 2016, the 4% simple interest rate suggested by
Claimant's expert represents an appropriate rate of interest, and represents more
than fair compensation for Claimant’s actual loss in circumstances where the US
one-year LIBOR rate during 2014 averaged 0.56%.

. Accordingly, Respondent submits that interest would continue to accrue at a rate

of LYD 594.01 per day.°7°

As to the application of the exchange rate, Article 5 of the Settlement Agreement
provides that the “amounts due to [Claimant] as stipulated in Article (3) of the
Agreement shall [be transferred at the specified exchange rate]”. This highly
favourable exchange rate is expressed to apply only to the principal sum in Article
3, not to any interest that may accrue under Article 4. To adopt Claimant's
reasoning, if the parties had wished to apply this exchange rate to any interest,
at an unspecified rate, that might accrue due to late payment, they would have
done so, rather than expressly applying the exchange rate only to amounts in
Article 3, which refers to the principal sum only. In any event, insofar as there is

doubt regarding the interpretation of Article 5, the clause must be construed in
favour of the debtor, the Ministry of Finance.*2"

413. Any interest rate should be simple, and not compounded. Compound interest is
rarely awarded, but when it is, it is reliant on pleading and proving loss from
specific alternative sources of funding, which Claimant has failed to do.°2?

414. The rate of interest for any sums awarded should be the 4% rate specified in the
Settlement Agreement.323

415. Should the Arbitral Tribunal instead propose an internationally pegged rate,
Respondent suggests 12 months Euro LIBOR plus 1%. Claimant's circumstances
do notjustify any other rate, as Claimant has had no cost of lending for investment
or for doing business in Libya, which Claimant ceased in 1998.924

C. THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONS

416. The BIT provides for standards of compensation for expropriation.°2> There is no
provision, however, dealing with the standard of compensation for a breach of the
fair and equitable treatment standard. In determining the compensation owed for
the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Arbitral Tribunal has
proceeded from the customary international law standard of full reparation for the
injury caused, as reflected in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.
The object is to put the injured party in the same position it would have been in,
had the illegal act not been committed.

417. Claimant has advanced alternative claims for compensation, depending on
whether the Arbitral Tribunal finds Respondent liable on contractual or treaty-
based grounds. In the event that the Arbitral Tribunal finds Respondent liable
under a treaty-based standard, Claimant has argued for the damages to be
calculated the same way regardless of which treaty standard is found to have
been violated.

418. The Arbitral Tribunal has found that Respondent violated the fair and equitable
treatment standard in Article 2(2) of the BIT. The Arbitral Tribunal will therefore
proceed with its determination of the damages based on Claimant's claims for
compensation for this violation.

The Parties seem to agree that the principal damages owed under the Settlement
Agreement is the principal sum specified in the Agreement itself, i.e. LD
5,420,308.707.°26

However, the Parties disagree over the calculation of interest due under the
Agreement, as well as the application of the exchange rate from LD to USD.

. Although the Parties agree that under Libyan law, the applicable interest rate for

the sums due under the Settlement Agreement is 4%, they disagree over the date
when interest starts to accrue. Claimant has argued that the appropriate starting
point is the date of the execution of the Settlement Agreement, i.e. 9 December
2013, whereas Respondent has argued that the appropriate starting point is the
two separate dates when the two respective instalment payments were due.

The Settlement Agreement does not specify the date from which interest accrues.
Article 4 provides that “Interest due on the agreed amount as specified in Article
(3) of this Agreement shall be calculated on each payment up to the time of actual
payment.” The amounts referred to in Article 3 are two equal sums of
LD 2,710,154.354 to be paid by 31 March 2014 and 30 June 2014 respectively.

The Parties also disagree over whether or not the currency exchange rate in the
Settlement Agreement applies also to the interest accrued under the Settlement
Agreement. In Claimant's view, the exchange rate applies to all parts of the
awarded amounts, including interest. In Respondent’s view, the exchange rate
only applies to the principal amount owed.

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, the appropriate dates when interest under the
Settlement Agreement starts to accrue are as of the respective due dates of the
two sums. In this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it is
not realistic to assume — in the absence of any indication to this effect in the text
of the Settlement Agreement — that the parties intended for Respondent to pay a
daily interest rate from the date of the conclusion of the agreement, as opposed
to from the date when the respective payments fell due.

As for the exchange rate in Article 5 of the Settlement Agreement, the Arbitral
Tribunal agrees with Claimant that this rate should apply also to the interest
accrued on the awarded principal amounts. As pointed out by Claimant, Article 5
refers back to a similar provision in the Court Decision.*?” The Court Decision
expressly states that the exchange rate applies to all amounts, including interest
owed on the principal amount.?8 As the Settlement Agreement is based on the
amounts in the Court Decision, it is reasonable that the same principle applies to
the exchange rate under the Settlement Agreement in the absence of any
indication to the contrary.

For the above reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that interest on the principal
amounts owed under the Settlement Agreement starts to accrue at the
contractually specified rate of 4% as of the dates when the sums should have

been paid, and that the currency exchange rate specified in the Settlement
Agreement applies also to this interest.

427. In these circumstances, the total damages owed under the Settlement Agreement
up to 29 August 2016, the date of the request for arbitration, is USD
19,768,000.38.°29

428. The total damages as of the date of the Award, including interest as per such
date, amount to USD 21,865,554. This sum is arrived at through the following
calculation. Interest calculated from the payment dates on the principal amount
of LD 5,420,308.707 means that interest at 4% on the first payment amounts to
LD 575,889.23752394541 12.5°° Interest at the same rate on the second payment
amounts to LD 548,861.944788183898158.°*' Adding these two interest sums to
the principal amount of LD 5,420,308.707 leads to a total amount of LD
6,545,059.889312129309358 due as of the date of the Award. Applying an
exchange rate of LD 0.299332 per USD 1 to this amount results in a total sum of
USD 21,865,554.

. The Arbitral Tribunal shares Respondent's view, as expressed by numerous other
tribunals, that moral damages are only available in exceptional circumstances.

431.

In the rare cases where tribunals have awarded moral damages, the factual
circumstances have been different from those in the present case. In the two
awards referred to by Claimant — Desert Line v. Yemen**? and Bernhard von
Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe*** — the circumstances were
exceptional. In Desert Line, the tribunal found that Respondent had exerted
physical duress on the claimant’s executives, in a manner that was “malicious
and [...] therefore constitutive of fault-based liability”.°*4 In von Pezold and others
v. Republic of Zimbabwe, the tribunal was presented with testimony from Mr. von

29 The first instalment of 2,710,154.354 was due on 31 March 2014. The number of days between 31
March 2014 and 29 August 2016 is 882. Thus, the calculation of the due amount would be as follows:
2,710,154.354 x 0,04 x (882 / 365) = 261,956.837. The second instalment of 2,710,154.354 was due
on 30 June 2014. The number of days between 30 June 2014 and 29 August 2016 is 791. Thus, the
calculation of the due amount would be as follows: 2,710,154.354 x 0,04 x (791 / 365) = 234,929.545.
39° The first instalment of 2,710,154.354 was due on 31 March 2014. The number of days between 31

March 2014 and 22 July 2019 is 1939. Thus, the calculation of the due amount would be as follows:
2,710,154.354 x 0,04 x (1939 / 365) = 575,889.2375239454112.

Pezold, which was “never seriously challenged” by the state,°°5 of humiliation,
death threats, assault, kidnapping and firearms put to the heads of Mr. von Pezold
and his staff.$9°

432. The facts of the present case do not constitute such exceptional circumstances.

Although Claimant's representatives — in particular Mr. Giinay — have
encountered financial and emotional difficulties in attempting to collect on the
money owed to Claimant, these difficulties do not rise to the level of harm required
to justify moral damages. Ultimately, this case concerns Respondent's
frustrations of contractual undertakings, as reflected in the Settlement
Agreement. Although the difficulties associated with the long period of time during
which Claimant's representatives have worked to collect the money owed were
exacting, Claimant has not been able to demonstrate convincingly any physical
duress or harm to its reputation resulting from Respondent's conduct. Under
these circumstances, non-compensatory damages of the kind requested by
Claimant cannot be available. In this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal’s conclusion
finds support in the findings of several other tribunals.*°”

433. For these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal rejects Claimant's claim for moral

damages.

Ill. Post-Award Interest Rate

434. The Parties have advanced different claims for the appropriate interest rate

applicable to the damages awarded in this Arbitration.

435. The Court Decision, which forms the basis for the Settlement Agreement,

provides for a relatively high rate of interest of 7,5%.°5° As a result, the sums
owed to Claimant have increased from some LD 1,9 million in the Court
Decision,**° to the LD 5.4 million agreed to in the Settlement Agreement.

436. The parties agreed in the Settlement Agreement to a simple interest rate of 4%

335

per annum. On the same theory on which the Arbitral Tribunal determines that
the principal amount of damages suffered by the Claimant is the sum agreed to
in that agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal has calculated the interest due as of the
date of the commencement of this arbitration, and continuing through until the
date of the Award, at the agreed rate of 4% simple interest.

7. Against this background, the Arbitral Tribunal is reluctant to award post-Award
interest at the rate requested by Claimant. Furthermore, as pointed out by
Respondent, Claimant does not seem to have incurred any costs associated with
the sovereign risk of Respondent.

8. For these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that a reasonable post-Award
interest rate is LIBOR + 3% per annum, compounded annually from the date of
the notification of the Award until the date of payment.

IV. Summary of Quantum

9. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the damages owed to Claimant under the
Settlement Agreement as per the date of the Award is USD 21,865,554. In
addition, Respondent shall pay post-Award interest on this amount at a rate of
LIBOR + 3% per annum, compounded annually from the date of the notification
of the Award. The claims for moral damages are rejected.

COSTS

9S

Pursuant to Articles 37(4) of the ICC Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal has a wide
discretion to “fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties
shall bear them or in what proportion they shall be borne by the parties”.

. Each Party has requested that the Arbitral Tribunal order the other Party to pay
its costs and expenses.

N

In this respect, Claimant has submitted that its costs and fees amount to USD
3,945,151.33. This amount includes legal fees; expert fees and costs; costs
associated with travel, personnel, arbitration hearing and other related costs; and
fees and expenses to the ICC.

o

. Respondent has submitted that its costs and expenses amount to GBP
1,393,321.59 and USD 63,750.00. These amounts cover legal fees; expert fees;
disbursements; and the advance on costs paid to the ICC.

paid to the ICC: Claimant in the amount of USD 516 250_and Respondent in the
amount of USD 63,750. On 2 July 2019, the ICC Court fixed the [CC costs of
arbitration at USD 542,600, out of which USD 478,850 was paid by Claimant and
USD 63,750 was paid by Respondent.

a

As for each Party’s costs and expenses, in the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, both
Parties’ respective claims are reasonable.

@

According to Article 37(5) of the ICC Rules, in exercising its discretion in
apportioning the costs the Arbitral Tribunal may take into account “such

circumstances as it considers relevant, including the extent to which each party
has conducted the arbitration in an expeditious and cost-effective manner’. In the
ICC Secretariat’s Guide to ICC Arbitration, a number of other factors to take into
account are listed. Of particular importance is the outcome of the case, about
which the Secretariat states that “the arbitral tribunal is likely to allow [an entirely
successful party] to recover some or all of its reasonable costs from the losing
party”.240

447. Claimant is the prevailing party, having succeeded on both jurisdiction, liability
and most of its claimed damages. However, Claimant did not succeed on its
request for moral damages, nor on its November 2017 request for interim
measures.

448. The Arbitral Tribunal further considers that both Parties have generally acted in
an expeditious and cost-effective manner, especially given the occasionally
challenging circumstances involved in obtaining documentation and witness
testimony from within Libya.

449. Taking these circumstances into account, the Arbitral Tribunal, in exercise of its
discretion under Articles 37(4)-(5) of the ICC Rules, finds it appropriate that each
side bears its own costs and expenses, and that Respondent pays the costs of
arbitration fixed by the ICC Court at USD 542,600. Therefore, Respondent shall
pay USD 478,850 to Claimant as compensation for the costs already paid by
Claimant.

X. DECISIONS

450. For the reasons set out above, the Arbitral Tribunal declares and decides as
follows:

|. | Respondent's objections against the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction are
rejected;

{l. The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over all of Claimant's claims based on the
BIT and raised in this arbitration;

Ill. | Respondent has breached Article 2(2) of the BIT by failing to accord fair and
equitable treatment to Claimant's investment;

IV. Respondent shall pay damages to Claimant in the amount of USD 21,865,554,
including pre-award simple interest accrued at 4% per annum;
