regards to the procedural calendar, the Tribunal deliberated and set forth a procedural
calendar for the Parties’ written pleadings.

resume the proceedings at its own discretion by filing a request with the Secretary of the
Tribunal.

Accordingly, on March 15, 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the proceeding
was suspended pursuant to the Parties’ agreement.

2010 from both counsel for the Claimants, the Parties advised the Tribunal that they had
signed an agreement on August 25, 2010 for the final and binding resolution of their
dispute and discontinuance of the proceedings (‘the Agreement’), The Agreement called
for a suspension of the proceedings for an indefinite period and stated that either Party
could resume the proceedings unilaterally in two situations: (i) if all the conditions set out
in the Agreement had been fulfilled; and (ii) if the conditions had not been fulfilled by
March 31, 2011.

On August 27, 2010 the Tribunal informed the Parties that the proceeding was suspended
for an indefinite duration and invited the Parties to update the Tribunal every three months

i
i

Vattenfall’s claims are contained in and defined by the Request for Arbitration of 30 March
2009 (“Claims”). Germany denies Vattenfall’s Claims and reserves its right to raise objections
to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the Claims. The Claims and
Germany’s denial and reservation constitute the dispute (“Dispute”).

On 12 March 2010 Vattenfall and Germany agreed to suspend the Proceedings for six (6)
months (until 11 September 2010), with the right for each party unilaterally to resume the
Proceedings at any time. On 15 March 2010, the Proceedings were suspended for six months
pursuant to the agreement of 12 March.

By virtue of the present Agreement, the Parties have agreed a mechanism for the final and
binding resolution of all of the Claims and of their Dispute in its entirety as well as the
discontinuance of the Proceedings.

shall cease to exist.

(2) Upon fulfilment of the Conditions, automatically and without the need for any further action
of any of the Parties, all and any claims that the Claimants or any of them or any of their
shareholders ever had, may have or hereafter can, shall or may have against the Respondent in
relation to the Dispute, shall be released and forever discharged. The Claimants shail hold
harmless and indemnify the Respondent for any claims raised against it by any of the
Claimants’ shareholders.

(3) For the sake of clarity, the Parties agree that paragraphs | and 2 of this Article do not apply
to any claims based on facts coming into existence after the conclusion of this Agreement, in
particular any claims which might arise out of or in relation to the performance of this
Agreement or the OVG-Settlement (as defined in Article 2 (a)).

(4) For the sake of clarity, the Parties also agree that, in case this Agreement is not fully
performed and the Claims are not discharged under paragraphs | or 2 of this Article, this
Agreement does not prejudice any Party with respect to the question whether the Claims and/ or
the Beschwer have ceased to exist or have been diminished by the conclusion and/or the partial
or complete performance of the OVG-Settlement (as defined in Article 2 (a)).
