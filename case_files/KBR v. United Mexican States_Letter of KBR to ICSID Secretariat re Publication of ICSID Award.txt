Re: KBR, Inc. v. The United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. UNCT/14/1)

Dear Ms. Kinnear:

Thank you for your correspondence of December 16, 2015 attaching Mr. Vejar’s letter of

December 9, 2015. We have provided a copy of each to our client.

Further to my email message of yesterday, paragraph 17.1 of the Procedural Order No. | of April
1, 2014 provides that “[t]he decision on the preliminary issue [of jurisdiction] may be made public only

with the consent of both parties.” Please note that KBR does not consent to the publication of the

Tribunal’s Final Award.

Respectfully submitted,

 

GuillermoV4guilar Alvarez
