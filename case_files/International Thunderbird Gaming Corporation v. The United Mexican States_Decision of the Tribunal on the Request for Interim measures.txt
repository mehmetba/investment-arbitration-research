Re: —_ International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States -
NAFTA/UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules Proceeding
Dear Sirs,

in the absence of Gonzalo Flores from the office, the President of the Tribunal has

asked me to inform you the following:

1

 

Reference is made to Thunderbird’s request for interim measures dated 27 June
2003.

During the August 15 conference call held between the Chairman and the parties
in connection with the interim measures, a number of practical aspects relating to
the application were agreed, and in particular that the parties would carry out a
joint visit of the sites.

The Tribunal is in receipt of Mexico’s letter of 13 November 2003, confirming
that the joint visit of the sites took place on 5, 6 and 7 November 2003. The
Tribunal therefore considers that Claimant’s application for interim measures has
become moot, without prejudice to the right of cither party to apply for interim
measures in the appropriate circumstances.

. Reference is also made to Claimant’s Supplemental Request for Production of

Documents dated 26 August 2003, and Mexico’s response thereto, filed by letter
of 15 October 2003.

By letter of 20 Octoher 2003, Claimant was invited by the Tribunal to file any
observations it may have on Mexico’s response by 23 October 2003. The Tribunal

notes that Thunderbird has not reacted to Mexico’s letter within the time allotted e@
by the Tribunal, from which the Tribunal infers that the matter does not require
further action from the Tribunal.

3. Reference is finally made to Mexico’s Supplemental Request for Production of
Documents dated 29 August 2003. The Tribunal acknowledges receipt of
Mexico’s application to the ‘Iribunal of 21 November 2003. Thunderbird is
requested to file its response to the application on or before Tuesday 2 December
2003.

Sincerely yours,

Claudia Frutos-Peterson
Counsel
