Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

I. INTRODUCTION

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes [“ICSID” or the “Centre”] on the basis of Law 7764 on foreign
investment of November 2, 1993 [“LFI’]! promulgated by the Republic of Albania,
and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States, dated March 18, 1965 [the “ICSID Convention’].

2. Claimant is Anglo-Adriatic Group Limited, a limited liability company incorporated
and operating under the laws of the British Virgin Islands with its legal seat in the British
Virgin Islands [““AAG” or the “Claimant’]. The registered office of AAG is located at
49 Main Street, P.O. Box 186, Road Town Tortola, British Virgin Islands”.

3. Respondent is the Republic of Albania, a sovereign State [“Albania” or
“Respondent’].

4. Claimant and Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”.

The dispute relates to privatization vouchers issued by the Republic of Albania, and the
collection of those vouchers by the Anglo Adriatika Investment Fund S.H.A. [“AAIF”].
Claimant’s alleged investment in Albania is the AAIF. Claimant avers that
Respondent’s refusal to allow the AAIF to participate in the privatization process
breached Albania’s undertakings assumed in the LFI.

6.  Albania’s agreement to arbitrate foreign investment disputes was formalized in Art. 8
LFI, which provides as follows?:

“Article No. 8. Dispute settlement.

1. If a dispute arises between a foreign investor and an Albanian private party or
an Albanian state enterprise or company, which has not been settled through an
agreement, the foreign investor may choose to settle the dispute according to any
kind of previously agreed upon and applied procedures. If there is no procedure
foreseen for the settlement of disputes, then the foreign investor has the right to
submit the dispute for resolution to a competent court or arbitrator of the Republic
of Albania, according to its laws.

2. If a dispute arises between a foreign investor and the Albanian public
administration, which has not been settled through an agreement, the foreign
investor may submit the dispute for resolution to a competent court or arbitrator of
the Republic of Albania, according to its laws. If the dispute relates to
expropriation, compensation for expropriation or discrimination, as well as to
transfers as provided in article 7 of this law, the foreign investor may submit the

1 C38 and RL-001.

2 RFA, para. 5 and C-1.

3 C-38 (certified translation). Another trans! has been ited by as RL-001. The accuracy
of some aspects of Respondent's translation has been questioned by Claimant (Cl. Rej., para. 94). The issue is
irrelevant to the effect of the analysis carried out in this Award.

dispute for resolution to the International Center [sic] for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“Center” [sic]), established by the Convention for the settlement of
investment disputes between the states and citizens of other states, approved in
Washington, on 18 March 1965.

3. Every decision of international arbitration according to this article is final and
irrevocable for the parties in dispute. The Republic of Albania undertakes to apply
without delay the provisions of these decisions and assure their implementation
within its territory”.

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

SUBMISSION OF THE RFA

On December 29, 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from
AAG against Albania [the “RfA”].

By letter of January 3, 2017, ICSID sent a first set of questions to AAG. AAG submitted
its responses on February 8, 2017. By letter of February 13, 2017, ICSID sent a second
set of questions to AAG. By letter of February 16, 2017, AAG provided its answers.

On February 17, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the RfA in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration.
In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to
constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of
ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration
Proceedings.

CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

By letter of February 28, 2017, Claimant proposed a method of constitution for the
Tribunal. By letter of April 14, 2017, Respondent provided its comments on Claimant’s
proposed method and a counter-proposal. By letter of April 24, 2017, Claimant
commented on Respondent’s April 14, 2017 letter. By letter of May 12, 2017,
Respondent provided further modifications to Claimant’s proposed method.

By Claimant’s letter of May 16, 2017 and Respondent’s letter of May 17, 2017, the
Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement
of the two co-arbitrators in consultation with the Parties.

The Tribunal is composed of Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a national of Spain,
President, appointed by his co-arbitrators; Dr. Georg von Segesser, a national of
Switzerland, appointed by Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern, a national of France,
appointed by Respondent.

On July 21, 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [the “Arbitration Rules”], notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal
was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Ella Rosenberg, ICSID
Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

FIRST SESSION AND PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 1

By letter of July 28, 2017, Claimant requested that the first session be held outside of
the 60-day time period due to counsel’s schedule, should Albania agree. By email of
the same date, Respondent also requested that the first session be postponed until the

end of September as counsel for Respondent was also not available within 60 days of
the constitution of the Tribunal.

By letter of July 31, 2017, Claimant requested the Tribunal to fix a time and date for
the first session during the first half of October 2017.

By letter of August 14, 2017, the Tribunal asked the Parties to confirm their availability
for a first session to be held on either October 16 or 27, 2017. By Claimant’s letter and
Respondent’s email of August 18, 2017, the Parties confirmed their availability for
October 16, 2017.

By letter of September 14, 2017, ICSID invited the Parties to comment on the
appointment of Dr. Luis Fernando Rodriguez as the Assistant to the Tribunal. The
Parties were provided with Dr. Rodriguez’s curriculum vitae and signed declaration of
independence and impartiality.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with
the Parties on October 16, 2017 by teleconference.

Following the first session, on November 2, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. | recording the Parties’ agreement on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1
provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from
April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, that the place of
proceeding would be Paris, France, and that Dr. Rodriguez would serve as Assistant to
the Tribunal. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the agreed schedule for the
proceedings.

MEMORIAL ON THE MERITS

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on December 1, 2017, Claimant filed its
Memorial on the Merits [“Cl. Mem.”] with accompanying documentation.

BIFURCATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND SCHEDULING OF THE HEARING
By email of December 29, 2017, Respondent requested an extension from January 2,
2018 to January 16, 2018 to file its Request for Bifurcation.

By email of January 2, 2018, the Tribunal granted Respondent until January 9, 2018, to
file its Request for Bifurcation.

On January 9, 2018, Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation [“RfB”] with
accompanying documentation.

On February 16, 2018, Claimant filed its Observations on Respondent’s Request for
Bifurcation [“ORfB”] with accompanying documentation.
On March 8, 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Bifurcation in which it decided

to bifurcate the proceedings based on three objections raised by Respondent. The
proceeding on the merits was thereby suspended.

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

On March 9, 2018, one day after issuing its Decision on Bifurcation, the Tribunal
informed the Parties that it could make itself available for a jurisdictional hearing in
Paris on July 19 and 20, 2018. The Parties were invited to confirm, by March 13, 2018,
whether they would be available on such dates.

On March 13, 2018, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it was available on July 19 but
not on July 20 and asked the Tribunal to reschedule the hearing for July 18 and 19,
2018.

On March 16, 2018, Albania replied that it would provide its availability for July 18,
19 and 20, the following week.

On March 28, 2018, Albania notified the Tribunal that it had engaged new external
counsel and provided contact details.

On March 29, 2018, Albania’s new external counsel submitted it would not be able to
prepare Respondent’s memorial on jurisdiction within the current calendar and stated
its intention to negotiate new deadlines with the opposing counsel.

On April 2, 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would be available for a
hearing on jurisdiction in Paris on July 19 or 20 (and possibly on July 18 in the
afternoon, if required). The message stated: “[g]iven the difficulties of finding dates
where all members are available, the parties [are] kindly invited to schedule the
procedure in such a way that these hearing dates can be preserved”.

On April 4, 2018, the Parties submitted they had reached no agreement regarding the
amendment of the calendar. Respondent’s new counsel asked the Tribunal to move the
deadline for the memorial on jurisdiction from April 9 to April 30, due to their recent
introduction to the case and the need for extra time to familiarize themselves with the
file. Claimant refused to make any amendments to the calendar.

On April 5, 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to reach an agreement before April 9,
2018 on the exact dates for the hearing among those already proposed: July 18 in the
afternoon, July 19 and July 20, 2018.

On April 6, 2018, the Tribunal issued an updated version of the calendar, extending the
deadline for the submission of the memorial on jurisdiction from April 9 to April 17,
2018, and extending accordingly Claimant’s deadline for submitting its counter-
memorial.

On April 9, 2018, both Claimant and Respondent confirmed their availability to hold a
jurisdictional hearing in Paris on July 17, 18, and 19, 2018.

PLEADINGS ON JURISDICTION

On April 17, 2018, Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction [“R.
Mem.”] with accompanying documentation.

On April 30, 2018, Respondent filed an Application for Security for Costs.

By email of May 2, 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimant to respond to the Application
for Security for Costs by May 16, 2018.

On May 16, 2018, Claimant filed its Response on Respondent’s Application for
Security for Costs.

On May 17, 2018, Respondent filed a request to submit new evidence into the record.

On May 24, 2018, Claimant asked the Tribunal to reject Respondent’s request of May
17, 2018 to introduce the New Document or, in the alternative, to decide that Claimant
is entitled to respond to such submission and submit further evidence proving that
Claimant has been a validly incorporated company in the British Virgin Islands and
active ever since January 17, 1996.

On May 28, 2018, Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction
[“Cl. CM”] with accompanying documentation.

On June 5, 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Security for Costs. With respect to
Respondent’s request to submit new evidence into the record the Tribunal decided as
follows:

“13. The Tribunal does not see any obstacle that would prevent Albania from submitting
the New Document together with its upcoming Reply, as well as including its own
assessment of the evidence in that pleading. [...]

14. Therefore, Albania’s Reply should be an appropriate and timely place for Respondent
to introduce the New Document into the record and discuss its probative value”.

The Tribunal also decided to dismiss the Application for Security for Costs and
“direct[ed] Respondent to resubmit and discuss the merits of its Application at the
Jurisdictional Hearing, if it so wishes.”

On June 11, 2018, Respondent filed its Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction [“R. Reply”]
with accompanying documentation.

On June 25, 2018, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction [“Cl. Rej.”]
with accompanying documentation.

PRE-HEARI

 

3 ARRANGEMENTS

By email of June 27, 2018, the Centre circulated to the Parties a draft Procedural Order
concerning the organization of the hearing and invited them to agree on as many items
as possible in advance of the pre-hearing conference.

By letter of June 28, 2018, Respondent stated that it intended to call the following
witnesses for cross-examination: Mr. Pirro Kushi, Mr. Declan Ganley, Mr. Gary
Hunter, Mr. Don de Marino, and Mr. Patrick Flynn. By letter of the same date, Claimant
requested to examine Mr. Daniel Barton and Mr. Conor Given.

By email of June 29, 2018, Respondent confirmed that Mr. Barton was available to
testify; however, it suggested that there had been a misunderstanding about Mr. Given’s
role as he was not an expert in this case.

By email of June 29, 2018, Claimant confirmed that it no longer wished to call Mr.
Given. Additionally, it noted that Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kushi would not be available to
testify in Paris.

By letter of June 29, 2018, Claimant requested the Tribunal’s permission to enter the
witness statement of Mr. Peter Goldscheider into the record.

By email of June 29, 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that, unless they objected, the
President would conduct the pre-hearing conference on behalf of the Tribunal.

By letter of June 30, 2018, Respondent requested that the Tribunal (i) do everything in
its power to ensure that Mr. Kushi could be cross-examined, (ii) strike Mr. Flynn’s
letters from the record, and (iii) not allow the submission of Mr. Goldscheider’s witness
statement.

By letter of July 2, 2018, Claimant asked for permission to enter the expert opinion of
Mr. William Kanaan into the record, and to examine an additional witness, Mr. Ken
Fields.

By letter of July 2, 2018, Respondent requested that the Tribunal (i) order the
authentication of the trust deeds submitted as exhibits C-58 through C-61, and the
ongoing funding agreement submitted as exhibit C-66; (ii) “order Claimant to confirm
that it ha[d] undertaken all reasonable efforts to find any original, signed hard copies of
the Objected Exhibits”; and (iii) order Claimant to produce the hard drives, with a chain
of custody, on which the exhibits were stored.

By further letter of July 2, 2018, Respondent responded to Claimant’s letter of the same
date and requested that the Tribunal deny both of Claimant’s requests.

By email of July 2, 2018, the Parties submitted their comments on the draft Procedural
Order.

On July 4, 2018, the President held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties
by telephone conference.

By email of July 5, 2018, the Tribunal asked Claimant to confirm, by close of business
that day, (i) if Mr. Kushi could testify by video conference and (ii) if Mr. Flynn could
testify in person at the hearing. By email of the same date, Claimant informed the
Tribunal that Mr. Kushi would be available to testify in person in Paris; however, that
Mr. Flynn was not available to testify and, in lieu of his testimony, Claimant made
available the expert opinion of Mr. Kanaan.

Il. SUMMARY OF RELEVANT T,

 

The following account presents the facts that are relevant to the Tribunal’s ruling.

THE VOUCHER-BASED PRIVATIZATIO! ALBANIA

 

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Albania and other countries of Central and Eastern
Europe found themselves in a transition from a State-controlled economy to a free-
market economy. During this period, many countries in the region adopted plans to
privatize State enterprises, based on the principle that public assets should now be
distributed to citizens who had contributed to the State’s wealth.

Within this context, in the early 1990s the Republic of Albania approved a mass
privatization program. The program sought to turn most State-owned companies into
private companies rapidly and efficiently, by allowing a great number of buyers to
acquire shares.

However, Albania’s privatization program faced two serious problems:

- due to the lack of purchasing power and financial knowledge, there was no actual
demand among the Albanian population to acquire the public assets, and
furthermore,

- foreign investors had little interest in acquiring State-owned businesses, due to their
general state of disrepair and the considerable bureaucracy involved.

Albania took two actions to overcome these problems.

First, in 1993, Albania passed the LFI (Law No. 7764 of November 2, 1993, on Foreign
Investment). The statute, still in force, guarantees foreign investors equality of treatment
with local investors, and protection against expropriation and nationalization. Breach
by Albania of its commitments enshrined in the LFI authorizes foreign investors to
submit their claims to arbitration under the ICSID Convention‘.

Second, in 1995, Albania developed a privatization program based on “privatization
vouchers”, which was implemented through Law No. 1030, of February 23, 1995.

In order to create a large pool of buyers for State-owned companies, and to disseminate
ownership among nationals, Albania issued and distributed bearer bonds — commonly
known as “privatization vouchers” — to its population. Most Albanian citizens above 18
years of age were entitled to receive privatization vouchers.

The vouchers were issued in two instalments through the Albanian Savings Bank, which
acted as an agent for the Government. The first instalment was delivered in the summer

4 This law was proclaimed by the Decree No. 687 of the President of the Republic of Albania on November 11,
1993. It has been amended by Law No. 10316, dated September 16, 2010, which has been approved by
presidential Decree no. 6703 on October 6, 2010. Articles 1 (definitions) and 8 (State’s consent to arbitration)
of Law No. 10316 still have the same wording and content as the previous law.

of 1996 and comprised roughly 20% of the total amount of privatization vouchers that
were meant to be distributed. The distribution of the second instalment began in
September 1996°.

The nominal value of the privatization vouchers depended on the contribution of the
specific person to the development of State-owned companies. Three main categories
of recipients were created, reflecting different age groups within the population. The
vouchers were issued to the bearer and freely tradeable. In the absence of a formal
market, holders could sell their securities via private agreements.

The privatization vouchers authorized their holders to acquire shares or assets of the
State-owned companies through three channels:

- By personally bidding for shares issued by the privatized companies;

- By buying physical assets or entire small companies in public auctions or direct
sales; or

- By assigning the vouchers to an investment fund, which would pool individual
stakes and participate jointly in privatization processes.

THE INCORPORATION OF INVESTMENT FUNDS

Pooling of vouchers held individually by each citizen was a cornerstone of the
privatization program as it would have been very inefficient for the State to sell
individual shares in State-owned companies to single voucher-holders. The envisaged
solution was the incorporation of investment funds of a substantial size, which would
in turn be able to acquire significant participations in, or significant assets owned by,
State-controlled companies.

On July 26, 1995 Albania enacted Law No. 7979, on Investment Funds [“LIFd”]. The
statute laid down the legal rules for the creation and activity of investment funds
authorized to hold privatization vouchers®. Holders of vouchers were granted the
possibility to contribute their privatization vouchers to the investment fund in exchange
for shares in the fund.

To avoid misuse and to minimize financial risks, the LIFd imposed restrictions on the
activities of investment funds; e.g., no investment fund could collect privatization
vouchers in excess of 10% of the total amount of privatization vouchers issued in the
country; investment funds were prohibited from obtaining loans or credits; and each
investment fund had to obtain an official license to operate’.

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

Only three investment funds were approved by the Albanian Government and given a
license to accumulate privatization vouchers. Only one of them, the AAIF actually
started operations.

THE CREATION OF THE AAIF

The AAIF is a legal entity established under the laws of the Republic of Albania with
its corporate seat in Albania and its registered address at Europapark, Bvd. Deshmont e
Kombit, Tirana, Albania.

The AAIF was formally registered as an anonymous company on May 6, 1996, by a
decision of the Tirana District Court [Judicial Registration Order”]*.

According to the Judicial Registration Order, the Company’s initial capital was USD
20,000, which was fully deposited with the Savings Bank of Albania. “This capital” —
the Judicial Registration Order reads — “has been advanced by cash contributors, which
capital is fully listed on the stock exchange: 400 shares, with each share having a
nominal value of ALL 5,000” ?.

The Judicial Registration Order also states that the 400 shares, each having equal value,
were owned by the following five people [“Founding Shareholders”):

- 80 shares by Mr. Declan J. Ganley;

- 20 shares by Mr. Stephan A. Murphy;

- 20 shares by Mr. Don N. De Marino;

- 80 shares by Mr. Michael Beck;

- 200 shares by Mr. Pirro Vasil Kushi.

The Judicial Registration Order also notes that Mr. Pirro Vasil Kushi is

“an Albanian national [...] thus fulfilling the requirement of Article 4(2) of the
Albanian Law 7979, dated July 26, 1995, on Investment Funds”.

Finally, the Judicial Registration Order orders the registration of the AATF on the basis
that the founders of:

“the Anonymous Company ‘Anglo-Adriatic Investment Fund’ have submitted all
necessary documents and, since I [the Judge] find them fulfilled according to the

Albanian laws in force”.

The Judicial Registration Order thus confirms that the share capital of the AAIF was

21

- 50% [“Foreign Shares”] subscribed by four non-Albanian shareholders: Messrs.
Ganley, Murphy, De Marino and Beck [“Foreign Shareholders”);

- 50% by an Albanian citizen (Mr. Kushi);

- and that the capital of USD 20,000 was contributed in cash by each of the founding
shareholders (the four non-Albanian shareholders paying in USD 10,000 and the
Albanian shareholder the remaining USD 10,000).

The terms of this Judicial Registration Order were confirmed at the Hearing. Three out
of the five Founding Shareholders testified at the Hearing (Mr. Declan J. Ganley, Mr.
Donald N. DeMarino, and Mr. Pirro Kushi) and confirmed that they paid in for these
shares with their own funds!°.

As explained, the AAIF was created to participate in Albania’s privatization process.
On May 22, 1996, soon after its creation, the Licensing Supervisory Committee of
Investment Funds granted the AAIF a permanent license to collect, hold and utilize
privatization vouchers of the Republic of Albania.

THE INCORPORATION OF CLAIMANT

A few months before the creation of the AAIF, Claimant, Anglo-Adriatic Group
Limited or AAG, had been incorporated as a British Virgin Islands limited liability
company, with its legal seat in the British Virgin Islands.

AAG was registered on January 17, 1996, with certain investment and merchant banks
and certain individuals acting as founding shareholders. Its purpose was the
development of investment opportunities offered by the mass privatization program of
Albania and other countries in the Adriatic region. The founders of the group include
inter alia Ganley International Ltd., a London-based investment banking group with
major holdings in Eastern Europe and Russia.

The following persons — which coincide with the Foreign Shareholders of the AAIF —
were appointed as directors of AAG:

- Mr. Declan J. Ganley;
- Mr. Michael P. Beck;
- Mr. Donald N. De Marino; and

- Mr. Stephen A. Murphy.

The authorized capital of the company was USD 500,000 divided into 500,000 shares
with a par value of USD 1.00 each. The issued share capital was 139,806 shares of USD
1.00 each".

Claimant maintains that its principal business purpose was to hold shares in the AAIF.
Claimant further submits that its plan was that at the closing of the privatization voucher
collection process, expected by the end of 1998, Claimant would remain as a 40%
shareholder of the AAIF' and that the remaining 60% of the shares in the AAIF would
be held by Albanian investors, who had contributed their privatization vouchers.

. Claimant avers — and this issue is at the heart of the present dispute — that in

October/November 1996 the Foreign Shareholders,

“declared to hold their shares in AAIF in trust for Claimant and thus provided
Claimant with beneficial ownership of the shares in AAIF”!?.

Thus, the Foreign Shareholders became the trustees — and AAG, the beneficiary — of
the Foreign Shares in the AAIF, which the Foreign Shareholders had subscribed a few
months earlier'*. To prove this averment, Claimant has submitted four Trust Deeds [the
“Trust Deeds” !>], which Claimant alleges prove that it became the beneficial owner of
the Foreign Shares in the AAIF.

THE OPERATION OF THE AAIF

. In June 1996, after obtaining its official license, the AAIF started collecting vouchers.

It opened collection centers in branches of the Savings Bank of Albania, in Tirana,
Durres, Elbasan, Korce and other cities throughout the country. In return for the
vouchers, the AAIF delivered to the Albanian population “membership certificates”,
reflecting the shares in the AAIF that the “depositor” would receive once the fund
closed.

. The staff working at the collection centers was employed by the Savings Bank of

Albania, which also acted as custodian bank of the privatization vouchers. Other
companies, such as Ganley International Ltd. and the American-Albanian Enterprise
Fund (set up by the US Government) trained the staff in collecting and processing the
vouchers.

The AAIF kept collecting privatization vouchers throughout the years 1997, 1998, and
1999. By February 1999, the AAIF had accumulated vouchers for a nominal value of
ALL 12,035,418,840 and had issued membership certificates to more than 45,000
Albanian citizens.

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS

Albania conducted the mass privatization program of State-owned companies in several
rounds, which took place between the years 1995 and 1997. Albania offered shares of
the State-owned company it was privatizing to voucher holders — such as the AATF — in
exchange for privatization vouchers.

AAG has brought this arbitration alleging that, despite AAIF’s attempts to participate
in the successive privatization processes, the Albanian Government intentionally
prevented the AAIF from doing so. According to Claimant, negotiations, discussions,
meetings, and proposals between the AAIF and the representatives of Albania have been
to no avail as Albania has repeatedly refused the AAIF’s offers to participate in the
privatization programs.

Claimant further states that, with its conduct, Albania indirectly expropriated the
AAIF’s value: even though the privatization vouchers were still valid (and have been —
in principle — legally valid until December 31, 2016), Albania rendered them virtually
worthless.

Claimant adds that, while the Albanian Government has prevented the AAIF from using
the vouchers in any privatization process, other foreign investors have acquired large
participations in the privatized companies. Such conduct allegedly was discriminatory
against Claimant vis-a-vis other foreign and domestic investors.

IV. RELIEF SOUGHT

1. CLAIMANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

109. In its Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, AAG submitted the following
request for relief:

“103. The Claimant respectfully requests the following relief in the form of an
Award on Jurisdiction:

(a) to decide that the dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence
of this Tribunal;

(b) to dismiss all of the Respondent’s objections on jurisdiction of ICSID and the
competence of the Tribunal;

(c) to order that the Respondent has to pay all costs of the proceedings on
jurisdiction, including the Tribunal’s fees and expenses and the costs of the
Claimants’ legal representation, subject to interest;
and
(d) any such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate”.

110. In its Post-Hearing Brief, AAG repeated verbatim this prayer for relief®.

2.  RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

11

. Albania presented its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, requesting the following
relief from the Tribunal:

“117. In view of the above, Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to:

(a) DISMISS all Claimant’s claims in their entirety and with prejudice;

(b) ORDER any such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and

(c) ORDER Claimant to pay all of the costs and expenses associated with these
proceedings, including Respondent’s legal fees, the fees and expenses of the

Tribunal and ICSID’s other costs”.

Vv. RTIES’ POSITIONS

 

SUMMARY OF RESPONDENT’S OBJECTIONS

. Albania raises the following jurisdictional objections:

- Claimant has not established that it is a protected investor (A.)

- Claimant has not made a protected investment (B.)

- Claimant has not properly commenced this arbitration (C.)

- Claimant has committed an abuse of rights by bringing this arbitration (D.)
The following subsections summarize each of Respondent’s objections.

Claimant has not established that it is a protected investor.

Albania argues that Claimant is not a protected investor as it did not exist at the time
the dispute arose and thus could not have validly consented to this arbitration'®.

An order from the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court of the BVI!? and the records of
the Registrar of Corporate Affairs of the BVI” show that from October 31, 2011, to
June 7, 2017, Claimant was a dissolved entity. On June 7, 2017, a BVI court re-
registered Claimant and declared that its earlier dissolution was void, had no effect, and
that Claimant “is deemed never to have been dissolved or struck off the register in
accordance with the BVI Business Companies Act 2004 section 218(3)?!”.

Albania alleges that this fact has two consequences.

First, Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention demands that jurisdiction ratione personae exist
on the date the dispute is submitted to arbitration”. Claimant must have legal
personality and be validly incorporated under the law of its place of incorporation on

the date the dispute is submitted to arbitration”?

. Second, Albanian law provides that only an entity with recognized legal personality is

empowered to enter into an arbitration agreement, or accept an outstanding offer to
arbitrate. Claimant has not established that it was a “legal person established in
accordance with the law of a foreign country” on the date it submitted the RfA, as
required by Arts. 1 and 8 LFI’*.

Claimant assumingly consented to submit this dispute to arbitration on December 29,
2016, when it filed its RfA. At this time, Claimant was a dissolved company; therefore,
its consent to this arbitration is non-existent and ineffective”. The subsequent
revocation of Claimant’s dissolution may be effective under BVI law, but not under
international law (the nationality requirement of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention) and
Albanian law (Arts. 1 and 8 LFI)”°.

In conclusion, Claimant is not a protected investor and the Tribunal does not have

jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims”’.

Claimant has not made a protected investment
Albania argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimant failed to make a
protected investment in Albania under Art. 1 LFI.
Claimant alleges that it made a qualifying investment in Albania under Art. 1 LFI,

namely:

- Its first investment is its beneficial ownership of 40% of the shares in the AAIF
obtained via the Trust Deeds (Exhibits C-58 to C-61) entered into with all of the
Foreign Shareholders”*.

- Its second investment is the USD 5.33 million that Claimant allegedly provided to
the AAIF under an Ongoing Funding Agreement (Exhibit C-66).

Albania contends that both investments do not qualify as such under Art. 1 LFI.

First investment

As for the first investment (AAIF Shares), there is no protected investment for the
following reasons:

First, Albania questions the authenticity of the evidence submitted by Claimant: the
Trust Deeds”.

127. Second, even if they were authentic, the Trust Deeds do not prove, on their face, AAG’s
ownership of the AAIF Shares, as Claimant itself has admitted*°.

128. Third, the Trust Deeds cannot provide Claimant with any ownership over the AAIF
Shares*!, because Albanian law does not provide for the concept of a “trust”?”.

129. Fourth, Claimant provided no consideration under the Trust Deeds in return for
receiving beneficial ownership of the AAIF Shares. A claimant who “did not pay for
his one share but rather ‘received’ it” cannot be considered to have made a

“contribution”**, and in this case, a qualified investment under Art. 1 LFI.

 

130. Fifth, Claimant’s alleged investment through ownership of the AAIF Shares would
breach Art. 1(c) LFI, which restricts investment protection only to those investments
that are carried out in conformity with the laws of Albania**. The alleged transfer of
beneficial ownership from the Foreign Shareholders to Claimant was never registered
or disclosed to the Albanian authorities, which constitutes a relevant breach of the
“LIFd”>.

 

Second investment

131. As for the second investment (the USD 5.33 million that Claimant allegedly provided
to the AAIF), Albania rejects that the Tribunal has jurisdiction for the following
reasons:

132. First, Albania does not accept the authenticity of the evidence provided, a one-page
document titled “Ongoing Funding Agreement” (C-66)*°.

 

133. Second, Albania argues that this document does not prove that Claimant actually
provided any money to the AAIF*’.

134, Third, Claimant has not put forward any of its financial records (or those of the AAIF),
which would have reflected the existence of the alleged payments*®.

135. Fourth, witnesses testified at the Hearing that they did not remember whether Claimant
provided any loans to the AAIF*’.

136. Fifth, even assuming that Claimant did provide funding to the AAIF, such funds were
used merely to cover development costs*”. Any costs that Claimant may have incurred
for creating the AAIF would not qualify as a protected investment*!.

137. Sixth, at any rate, any funding would breach the LIFd*?, which prohibits funds from
borrowing money or taking loans of any kind. The funding would have thus constituted
an illegal and unprotected investment’.

138. In conclusion, in Respondent’s view, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because Claimant
has failed to prove the existence of its two alleged investments. In the alternative,
Respondent maintains that both of the alleged investments were illegal and fall outside
Albania’s consent to arbitrate’.

C. Claimant has not properly commenced this arbitration

139, Albania argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimant failed to comply
with the requirement, under Art. 8(2) LFI, of making a good faith effort to reach an
amicable agreement to their dispute before starting an ICSID arbitration*.

140. First, the language of Art. 8(2) LFI must be understood to require that foreign investors
make a good faith effort to reach an amicable agreement to their dispute prior to
submitting it to ICSID*®. As explained in Burlington Resources Inc., such requirement
typically consists of

“inform[ing the State] that it faces allegations of Treaty breach which could

- Claimant has not put forward any documentary evidence that it tried to settle this
dispute, save for the testimony of Mr. Peter Goldscheider, who allegedly did so in
very short and informal conversations with Albanian public officials”®.

- Any formal attempts of settlement were carried out after the arbitration was
initiated, which cannot satisfy retroactively the procedural requirement under Art.
8(2) LFP?.

- Even accepting Claimant’s allegations, settlement negotiations would be carried
out at a time when Claimant was dissolved and non-existing”!.

. For all these reasons, Claimant has not established that it properly commenced these

arbitration proceedings.

Claimant has committed an abuse of rights by bringing this arbitration.

Albania submits that Claimant has engaged in an abuse of rights by seeking to
artificially manufacture jurisdiction in this arbitration®”.

According to the leading cases Phoenix Action Ltd.» and Philip Morris Asia Limited™,
an abuse of rights typically arises where “an investor who is not protected by an
investment treaty restructures its investment in such a fashion as to fall within the scope
of protection of a treaty in view of a specific foreseeable dispute”*.

In light of the evidence submitted, this is what has happened in this case:
- Claimant was dissolved at the time this arbitration was initiated™®.

- Claimant has not shown that it has made any investment at all in Albania. In
contrast, it is proved that the Albanian Government ordered that the vouchers be
returned from the Savings Bank to the Albania vouchers holders*’.

In summary, Claimant has violated the spirit of the ICSID Convention and investment
law in general by trying to artificially create jurisdiction. Such attempt constitutes an

abuse of rights**.

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

SUMMARY OF CLAIMANT’S REPLY TO OBJECTIONS

Claimant replies that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claims and requests the
Tribunal to dismiss all objections raised by Albania® for the following reasons:

- Claimant is a qualifying investor (A.)

- Claimant has made a protected investment (B.)

- Claimant has properly commenced this arbitration (C.)
- Claimant has not committed any abuse of rights (D.)

The following subsections summarize each of Claimant’s replies to Respondent’s
objections.

Claimant is a qualifying investor

Claimant argues that it legally exists and is validly incorporated under the laws of
British Virgin Islands and satisfied all of these requirements on the date the parties
consented to submit this dispute to arbitration, i.e. December 29, 2016. Therefore,
according to Claimant, it is a qualifying investor that meets the conditions of Art. 25 of
the ICSID Convention as well as the other legal requirements under Albanian law.

According to Claimant, the jurisdictional ratione personae element is based on the legal
existence of a company validated according to the laws of the State of its incorporation.
The laws of the BVI acknowledge Claimant’s continuous legal personality and valid
incorporation from January 17, 1996 to date. The order of Eastern Caribbean Supreme
Court (BVI)! and the records of the Registrar of Corporate Affairs of the BVI® show
that Claimant was in legal existence and good standing as of December 29, 2016,
pursuant to Section 218B (6) BVI Business Companies Act 2004. Claimant is deemed
to have never been dissolved or struck off the register.

. Claimant contends that Albania is wrong when it asserts that Claimant was not a legal

person established in accordance with the law of a foreign country for the purposes of
Arts. 1 and 8 of the LFI. Claimant maintains that as of December 29, 2016, it has been
in legal existence and good standing™.

. In conclusion, in Claimant’s view, with its RfA dated December 29, 2016, Claimant

confirmed its legal existence and validly consented to this arbitration. Therefore, the
Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae to hear Claimant’s claims.

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

Claimant has made a protected investment

Claimant alleges that it made a qualifying investment in Albania under Art. 1 LFI,
namely:

- _ Its first investment is AAG’s beneficial ownership of 40% of the shares in the AAIF
(and therefore the vouchers held by the AAIF) obtained via the Trust Deeds
(Exhibits C-58 to C-61) entered into with all of the Founding Shareholders except
Mr. Pirro Kushi®.

- Its second investment is the USD 5.33 million that Claimant provided to the AAIF
under an Ongoing Funding Agreement (C-66).

First investment

As for the first investment, AAG claims to have made a qualifying investment in
Albania under Art. 1 LFI because all the Foreign Shareholders held the shares on trust
for AAG. AAG makes the following arguments:

First, regarding the authenticity of the Trust Deeds, the witnesses confirmed at the
Hearing that they had indeed signed the respective Trust Deeds®’.

 

Second, although AAG admits there was a mishap in the drafting of the Trust Deeds,
this mistake is legally irrelevant. The written trust agreements have to be interpreted in
accordance with the intention of the parties involved®, which was to establish a trust
relationship. The Foreign Shareholders had intended to hold their shares in trust for
AAG, which was meant to be the beneficiary of the trust®.

. Third, Claimant has never violated the principles of legality and good faith”:

-  AAG’s ownership via Trust Deeds does not constitute a fact that should be entered
in the official registry’!. Upon conclusion of the Trust Deeds, the legal title in the
shares in the AAIF remained with each of the Founding Shareholders: since no
transfer occurred, there was no obligation to disclose Claimant’s beneficial
ownership in its AAIF Shares”.

- Inthe alternative, the obligation to register the share transfer pursuant to Art. 6.4(a)
LIFd were obligations of the AAIF, not Claimant’s’?.

-  Atany rate, Albania was aware of Claimant’s ownership of shares”.

Second investment

158. Claimant made a second qualifying investment in Albania under Art. 1 LFI. From 1994
to 2000 Claimant provided USD 5.33 million in loans to the AAIF”>. Such funding
constitutes a protected investment”:

159. First, AAG made substantial investments in the territory of Albania by funding AAIF’s
operating expenses, such as:

- establishment of the voucher collection centers,

- advertisements related to the collection process,

- employment of Albanian staff, and

- payments to third parties, which provided the premises for the collection centers”.

160. Second, Claimant has submitted the Ongoing Funding Agreement (C-66) and a
calculation of current value of Claimant’s frustrated operating expenses (C-35). Both
documents show that operating expenses amounting to USD 5.33 million have been
paid by Claimant to the AAIF. In addition, witnesses at the Hearing testified
consistently that Claimant contributed operation expenses in the AAIF”®, Both Claimant
and the AAIF kept some form of balance sheets or other financial records”. The fact
that Respondent’s expert could not find evidence for the actual payment of the operating
costs does not mean that they did not exist at the time®?.

161.

Third, the operating expenses were paid on the basis of the Ongoing Funding
Agreement, but without the obligation of full repayment. Thus, the operating expenses
constitute a right arising out of a contract and therefore a protected investment in
accordance with Art. | LFI®!.

. Fourth, in any case, assuming that the operating costs constitute a loan, the law currently

in force (Law No. 10198 on Collective Investment Undertakings*”) does not contain the
old prohibition to take loans®*.

. For all these reasons, the Tribunal has jurisdiction because AAG made two valid

investments under Art. 1 LFI.

Claimant has properly commenced this arbitration.

Claimant submits that this arbitration has been validly commenced, as there is no
mandatory precondition under Art. 8(2) LFI that investors must try to reach a settlement
before submitting the case to the ICSID™.

First, nothing in the language of Art. 8(2) LFI serves as basis to establish a mandatory
duty or precondition to try to reach a settlement before bringing an arbitration against
Albania®>. The statute clearly states that a foreign investor may submit any unsettled
dispute to ICSID. There is no hint of a preliminary duty to carry out settlement
negotiations®°.

Second, Claimant has in any case proven that it tried to reach an amicable settlement
before starting this arbitration*’:

- Claimant was not dissolved at the time of the pre-arbitration negotiations and was
therefore able to be represented by agents**.

- In fact, Mr. Gentian Sule and Mr. Peter Goldscheider acted as Claimant’s valid
representatives in the attempts to settle the dispute*®. They tried several times to
reach an amicable solution with Albania during the years leading to the
commencement of this arbitration®® as Mr. Peter Goldscheider’s testimony at the
Hearing makes clear®!, They held some meetings with Albanian public officials, to
whom they explained the pending dispute and the merits of Claimant’s

complaints”.

- Albania however chose to dismiss or ignore their several requests for official
settlement talks®>.

In conclusion, Claimant validly commenced this arbitration’.

Claimant has not committed any abuse of rights

Claimant says that it has not created jurisdiction artificially. Nor has Claimant ever
performed any act or omission constituting an abuse of rights”®.

First, the facts in this arbitration are different from the facts in Phoenix Action Ltd.,
whose conclusions are not applicable to this case”’. The tribunal in Phoenix dismissed
the claim because the investment was not made for the purpose of engaging in economic
activity but to submit a pre-existing dispute to ICSID. In this arbitration, however,
Claimant has shown that the investment was made for the purpose of engaging in
economic activities®®.

Second, Claimant did not carry out any corporate restructuring and has never hidden
the fact that it did not directly hold the shares in the AAIF””. Besides, the special purpose
vehicle and the trust relationships involved in this arbitration are not unusual in
international investment transactions and do not amount to any legal violation!. As
explained in Libananco,

“The Respondent bases its request on the claim that the Claimant [...] is a shell
company without assets of its own. [...] [F]ar from this being an unusual exception,
it is in practice closer to the norm that the entity appearing as an ICSID Claimant
is an investment vehicle created or adapted specially for the purpose of the
investment transaction that has in the meanwhile become the subject of the
dispute”!"!.

. Finally, Claimant has never breached Albanian law, withheld information about its

investment or acted mala fide. On the contrary, Claimant has always complied with
legal and regulatory obligations under Albanian law and the ICSID Convention'”?.
Claimant wishes to enforce its right to obtain damages due to Albania’s expropriation
of its investment!" This arbitration is the last option for Claimant to enforce its rightful
claim'™™*.

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

VI. DISCUSSION

. Albania alleges that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction on the following four grounds:
(i) Claimant has not established that it is a protected investor;
(ii) Claimant has not made a protected investment;
(iii) Claimant has not properly commenced this arbitration; and
(iv) Claimant has committed an abuse of rights by bringing this arbitration.
. Claimant alleges that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear its claims because:
(i) Claimant is a qualifying investor
(ii) Claimant has made a protected investment;
(iii) Claimant has properly commenced this arbitration;
(iv) Claimant has not committed any abuse of rights.
. In this section the Tribunal considers the second objection only. This second objection

deals with Claimant’s allegation that it made a qualifying investment in Albania under
Art. 1 LFL Claimant argues that it holds two protected investments in Albania:

- The beneficial ownership of 50% of the shares in the AAIF, acquired via the Trust
105.

Deeds entered into with the Foreign Shareholders‘; and
- USD 5,334,133, which Claimant allegedly provided to the AAIF under an Ongoing
Funding Agreement.

Albania’s position is that Claimant has failed to prove that either of these investments
were ever made. In the alternative, Albania maintains that neither constitutes a protected
investment, because the investments were not carried out in accordance with Albanian
law!°,

In the following subsections, the Tribunal first explains the relevant legal rules and the
applicable law (1.) and then examines the two alleged investments: Claimant’s
beneficial ownership of the Foreign Shares in the AAIF (2.) and the funding to the AAIF
allegedly made by Claimant (3.). After examining the arguments and the evidence
submitted, the Tribunal will conclude that under Art. 1 LFI Claimant has not proven
ownership of any protected investment in Albania, and consequently that the Centre
lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence to adjudicate this dispute (4.).

. The Tribunal’s findings as to the second objection render the remainder of Respondent’s
objections — valid existence of the investor, commencement of the arbitration and abuse
of rights — moot and, as a result, the Tribunal will not address them.

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

RELEVANT LEGAL RULES

According to Art. 25(1) ICSID Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre extends to any
legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing
to submit to the Centre:

“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out
of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or
agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national
of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to
submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally”.

Claimant is a company incorporated and operating under the laws of the British Virgin
Islands. Its written consent was explicitly included in para. 47 of its Notice of
Arbitration, filed with ICSID on December 20, 2016.

The consent of the Republic of Albania is formalized in domestic law, and more
specifically in the LFI (pro memoria: the Law on Foreign Investment, explained in
paras. 6 and 77 above).

. Art. 8.2 LFI provides that foreign investors may submit their claims against Albania for

compensation for expropriation or discrimination to ICSID arbitration, in accordance
with the ICSID Convention. The relevant provision provides:

“Article No. 8. Dispute settlement.

1. If a dispute arises between a foreign investor and an Albanian private party or
an Albanian state enterprise or company, which has not been settled through an
agreement, the foreign investor may choose to settle the dispute according to any
kind of previously agreed upon and applied procedures. If there is no procedure
foreseen for the settlement of disputes, then the foreign investor has the right to
submit the dispute for resolution to a competent court or arbitrator of the Republic
of Albania, according to its laws.

2. If a dispute arises between a foreign investor and the Albanian public
administration, which has not been settled through an agreement, the foreign
investor may submit the dispute for resolution to a competent court or arbitrator of
the Republic of Albania, according to its laws. If the dispute relates to
expropriation, compensation for expropriation or discrimination, as well as
to transfers as provided in article 7 of this law, the foreign investor may
submit the dispute for resolution to the International Center for Settlement
of Investment Disputes (“Center”), established by the Convention for the
settlement of investment disputes between the states and citizens of other states,
approved in Washington, on 18 March 1965”. [Emphasis added]

182. Art. 1 LFI also provides the statutory definitions of “foreign investor” and “foreign

investment”:

37

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

- According to Art. 1(2) LFI, the term “foreign investor” means every physical
person that is a citizen of a foreign country, and every legal entity founded
according to the laws of a foreign country that has carried out investments in
Albania;

- The same provision requires that foreign investors must carry out an investment in
the territory of the Republic of Albania in conformity with its laws;

- Further, Art. 1(3) LFI defines the term “foreign investment” as any kind of
investment in the territory of Albania, performed directly or indirectly by a foreign
investor, and then provides a list of examples, which includes shares in and loans
to companies.

 

183. The language of Art. 1 LFI reads as follows:

“Article No. eneral provisions.

For the purpose of this law, “territory” means the territory under the sovereignty
of the Republic of Albania, including territorial waters, maritime zones and
continental shelf, over which the Republic of Albania, in accordance with
international norms, exercises its legal and sovereign rights.

“Foreign investor” means:
a) every physical person who is a citizen of a foreign country; or

b) every physical person who is a citizen of the Republic of Albania, but resides
outside the country; or

c) every legal person established in accordance with the law of a foreign
country, who directly or indirectly seeks to carry out or is carrying out an
investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania in conformity with its
laws, or has carried out an investment in conformity with its laws during the
period from 31.07.1990 to the present.

“Foreign investment” means any kind of investment in the territory of the
Republic of Albania, performed directly or indirectly by a foreign investor that

consists of:

a) movable or immovable, tangible or intangible assets, or any other kind of
ownership;

b) a company, rights that derive from any kind of participation in a company,
shares, etc;

c) loans, monetary obligations or obligations in an activity of an economic
value and related to an investment;

38

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

c) intellectual property, including literature and artistic, scientific and
technological products, audio recording, inventions, industrial designs,
schemes of integrated circles, know how, trademarks, designs of trademarks
and trade names;

d) every right recognized by law or contracts and every license or permission
issued in accordance with the laws.

“Dispute over a foreign investment” means every disagreement or presumption
caused by a foreign investment or related to it”. [Emphasis added]

Other applicable laws

184. Apart from the LFI, the LIFd (pro memoria, the Law No. 7979 on Investment Funds,
of July 26, 1995, explained in para. 84 above) is relevant to this case!°’. The LIFd was
in force from the mid-90s until the adoption of the Law No. 10198 on Collective
Investment Undertakings of December 10, 2009!°8. The LIFd used to govern the
establishment, activity, and public supervision of investment funds!™.

185. Art. 6.4 LIFd further provided that all rights in fund shares had to be held by registered
shareholders !!°. The law also required that the transfer of any shares had to be registered
with the Albanian authorities within ten days!'!:

“IV. SHARE CAPITAL IN THE INVESTMENT FUND.

LJ

6.4, All the shares in an investment fund must be registered and are feely [sic]
transferable.

a) When an investment fund is not registered in a licensed stock exchange of
the securities, the person transferring the share and the one receiving it shall
conclude an agreement to evidence the transfer, a copy of which is delivered to the
investment fund. The investment funds, shortly thereafter registers such
transfer within the next 10 days [sic].

b) When an investment fund is registered on a licensed stock exchange, the transfer
is carried out in accordance with the rules and procedures provided in the stock
exchange”. [Emphasis added]

“16.1. The investment fund shall, not later than 60 days from the end of each
quarterly period, publish in a nationally known newspaper and submit to the

regulatory authority the financial balance, which shall contain:

- A list of the investment containing the issue, the number and the type of shares
at the end of a quarterly period.

Led

- The identity and the percentage owned by 10 of the largest shareholders of
the investment fund.

- [...]”. [Emphasis added]

187. Finally, Art. 13.1 LIFd prevented investment funds from carrying out certain financial
operations, inter alia, “to borrow money or to take loans of any kind”:

“13.1, An investment fund is not entitled to perform the following actions:

- To invest more than 10 percent of its net assets in the shares of a sole entity.
- To invest in shares issued by other investment funds.

- To invest in any entity owning more than 5 percent of fund’s shares.

- To accept to sell shares that it doesn’t own.

- To borrow money or take loans of any kind.

- To grant guarantees or promises of any kind.

- To have ownership or debt interests to its directors and its depositor, its

188. AAG claims to have made a protected investment in Albania under Art. 1 LFI, arguing
that the Foreign Shareholders transferred beneficial ownership of the Foreign Shares
(equivalent to 50% of AAIF’s share capital) to AAG and held the Foreign Shares in
trust for the benefit of AAG!!?.

189. To prove this investment arrangement, Claimant has provided four Trust Deeds dated
October/November 1996. Each Trust Deed presents similar language, provisions and
content. In each Trust Deed Claimant appears both as the settlor and the beneficiary.

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

Only the identity of the trustee changes: each Trust Deed has one Foreign Shareholder
as trustee!!>,

 

190. The corpus of the trust is described in each Trust Deed as a number of shares in the
AAIF (80 shares held by Mr. Declan J. Ganley in trust for AAG!'*; 20 shares held by
Mr. Don De Marino!!°; 80 shares held by Mr. Michael P. Beck!'®; and 20 shares held
by Mr. Stephen Murphy!!”), which have been defined above as the Foreign Shares (see
section III.3 above).

191. In the next subsections, the Tribunal summarizes Albania’s position (A.) and
Claimant’s position (B.), and then concludes that Claimant has not made a qualifying
investment under Arts. 1 and 8 LFI (C.).

A. Albania’s position

192. Albania objects to the authenticity, validity, and legal effects of the alleged trust
arrangements, on the following grounds.

193. First, Albania questions the authenticity of the Trust Deeds!!®.

194. Second, the Trust Deeds, on their face, do not prove AAG’s ownership of the AAIF
Shares for the following reasons:

- Albania admits that under English trust law it is possible for the settlor to also serve
as the beneficiary!””.

- However, in order to create a valid trust, the settlor (as the creator of the trust) must
have title to the property it is purporting to place into the trust: one cannot give
away what one does not have (nemo dat quod non habet)'?°.

- In this case, the trusts’ settlors are not the Foreign Shareholders — as one would
have expected — but AAG; the Trust Deeds do not prove how AAG came to be the
owner of the AAIF Shares; nor does any other document in the record.

- Claimant itself admitted the flaws of the Trust Deeds and accepted at the Hearing
that “the settlor has been wrongly defined”!?!; counsel further explained:

“Tt is true that Anglo Adriatic Group Ltd, the Claimant, is mentioned as the settlor
in such agreement. This might have been due to an error of then counsel of Declan

Ganley, Don De Marino, Stephen Murphy, Michael Beck and the Claimant. We
simply do not know how that slip-up was produced or what led to such slip-up”!”?.

195. Third, as a matter of Albanian law, the Trust Deeds do not provide Claimant with any
ownership over the AAIF Shares!?3, because

- the Albanian Civil Code does not provide for the concept of a “trust”, a notion that
is foreign to Albanian law!*4 and because

- Albania is not a party to the Convention of July 1, 1985, on the Law Applicable to
Trusts and on their Recognition; thus, there is no automatic recognition or
enforcement of foreign trusts under Albanian law!”

196. Fourth, only investments made in accordance with Albanian law can enjoy the legal
protection granted under Art. 1 LFI'?°. Disputes arising out of an illegal investment fall
outside the scope of Albania’s consent to arbitrate!?’. Claimant’s alleged investment in
the AAIF Shares is not legal for the following reasons:

- Art. 1(c) LFI restricts investment protection only to investments that are “‘carried
out [...] in conformity with” the laws of Albania!?°.

- Arts. 2.2 and 6.4 LIFd provided that all rights in the shares of a fund must be held
by the registered shareholders of these shares!'??; the law further required that the

transfer of any shares in the AAIF had to be registered with the Albanian authorities
within 10 days; the identity of the shareholders had to be reported on an ongoing
basis every quarter (Arts. 6.4(a) and 16.1 LIFd!°).

- Despite these provisions, the alleged transfer of beneficial ownership from the
Foreign Shareholders to Claimant was never registered or disclosed to the Albanian
authorities, in violation of Albanian law!*!.

197. Fifth, even if the Trust Deeds were correctly made and ownership was transferred to
Claimant, the fact remains that Claimant provided no consideration under the Trust
Deeds in return for receiving beneficial ownership of shares in the AAIF. As noted in
the Quiborax case, a claimant who “did not pay for his one share but rather ‘received’
it” cannot be considered to have made a “contribution” !*”.

B. Claimant’s position

198. Claimant replies that the Trust Deeds are authentic, enforceable and serve as basis to
establish Claimant’s beneficial ownership of the AAIF Shares, for the following
reasons!*3,

199, First, Respondent has failed to raise any serious doubts about the authenticity of the
Trust Deeds'**. To the contrary:

 

- at the Hearing, the witnesses confirmed that they had signed the Trust Deeds. Since
the signing took place 22 years ago, it is understandable that the witnesses could
not fully recollect the exact location and circumstances!*>.

- The fact that the Trust Deeds are now only available in digital form does not make
them suspicious. Mr. Gary Hunter — as the person responsible for keeping the files
of AAG and the AAIF in Albania — testified at the Hearing that he was not able to
save all the paper documentation during his emergency evacuation from the
country, following the clash of the civil war in 1997!°°.

which is delivered to the investment fund. The investment funds, shortly thereafter registers [sic] such transfer
within the next 10 days.

b) When an investment fund is registered on a licensed stock exchange, the transfer is carried out in accordance
with the rules and procedures provided in the stock exchange”.

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

Second, under English law, the Foreign Shareholders may hold their shares in the AAIF
in trust for Claimant and provide Claimant with beneficial ownership of the AAIF
Shares!*’, Admittedly, there was a mishap in the drafting of the Trust Deeds. Counsel
for the Foreign Shareholders at the time misstated the “settlor” in the instruments. But
this mistake is legally irrelevant. The written trust agreements have to be interpreted in
accordance with the intention of the parties involved'**. It has always been the clear
intention of the parties to establish a trust relationship, in which the Foreign
Shareholders hold their shares in trust for the benefit of Claimant!*’. At the Hearing,
Mr. Declan Ganley, Mr. Gary Hunter and Mr. Don DeMarino all confirmed that they
held (and still hold) their shares in trust for AAG'°. Therefore, the Trust Deeds are
valid and enforceable!*!.

[Albania replies as follows”:

- The language of executed trusts is governed by strict rules of construction and the
statement that a defective trust deed can be saved by reference to the alleged subjective
intent of the parties is not correct under English law.

- There is no testimony from Mr. Ganley or any of the other signatories to the Trust
Deeds supporting AAG’s speculation as to what they understood or intended.

- None of the witnesses provided any information as to the creation of any oral trust,
whose legality is doubtful and unproven.]

Third, Claimant has never violated the principles of legality and good faith'**:

-  Claimant’s beneficial ownership via the Trust Deeds does not constitute a fact that
should be entered in the registry'**. Upon conclusion of the Trust Deeds, the legal
title in the shares in the AAIF remained with each Founding Shareholder and no
transfer occurred. Thus, neither Claimant, nor Declan Ganley or the AAIF would
have been obliged under any provision of Albanian law to disclose Claimant’s
beneficial ownership of the shares in the AAIF. Accordingly, neither Claimant nor
the AAIF violated any publication provision under the LIFd'*>.

- Even if Claimant’s interest in the Shares should have been entered in the trade
registry, the obligation to register the share transfer pursuant to Art. 6.4(a) LIFd lay

with the AAIF alone'*®. Claimant cannot be held liable for the compliance of the
AAIF with the relevant Albanian laws and regulations'*’.

-  Atany rate, Albania cannot pretend that it was not aware of Claimant’s ownership
of shares “8,

203. [Albania replies that this defense is not valid, mainly for the following reasons!*:

- — What actually matters is that the investment was not carried out in accordance with
Albanian law. It is irrelevant who had to fulfill the legal requirements'°.

- Previous tribunals have recognized that investors have the direct obligation to
carry out “due diligence”, which includes “assur[ing] themselves that their
investments comply with the law”. Hence, Claimant’s failure to make sure its
investment complied with the applicable Albanian law constitutes a bar to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction'>!.]

204. In conclusion, Claimant alleges that it has not violated any principle of legality and
good faith. Its ownership in the shares in the AAIF does constitute a protected
investment.

C.  Tribunal’s analysis

205. AAG claims to have made a qualifying investment in Albania under Art. 1 LFI, alleging
that the Founding Shareholders held the AAIF Foreign Shares in trust for AAG. Albania
disagrees.

206. The Tribunal sides with Albania for the following reasons.

207. For the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, Arts. 1 and 8 LFI require the fulfillment of three
requirements: existence of a protected investment (a.); existence of a protected investor,
who acts as claimant in the arbitration (b.); and that the claimant is the owner or
titleholder of the protected investment (c.).

208. In assessing these jurisdictional requirements, the burden of proof lies with Claimant.

“[I]f jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at
the jurisdictional stage” !*?.

Albania has also correctly noted that, in any ICSID arbitration,

“Talt the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must establish [...] that the jurisdictional
requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of the Treaty are met,
which includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements'**”.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) grants the Tribunal wide discretion in assessing the
evidence:

“The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and
of its probative value”.

Thus, after considering the evidence submitted in this case, the Tribunal concludes that
AAG has not proved the third requirement: that Claimant is the owner or titleholder of
the protected investment.

The following subheadings discuss each of the requirements.
Foreign investment

The first requirement under Art. 1 LFI is the existence of a “foreign investment’, as
defined by this provision. “Foreign investment” legally means

“any kind of investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania, performed
directly or indirectly by a foreign investor”.

The statute lists a number of assets and economic operations that qualify as an
“investment”, among them, shares. The relevant language provides:

“b) a company, rights that derive from any kind of participation in a company,
shares, etc.”.

The existence of the AAIF and its Foreign Shares has been proven through the
submission of a Judicial Registration Order, issued by the Tirana District Court on May
6, 1996. The Order formally registers the AAIF as an anonymous company !**.

The AAIF’s initial capital was USD 20,000, fully paid-in and deposited with the
Savings Bank of Albania. The Judicial Registration Order states that the capital was
divided into 400 shares, of equal value, and owned by the Founding Shareholders,
which included four Foreign Shareholders plus Mr. Kushi, an Albanian national:

- 80 shares by Mr. Declan J. Ganley;

- 20 shares by Mr. Stephan A. Murphy;
- 20 shares by Mr. Don N. De Marino;

- 80 shares by Mr. Michael Beck;

- 200 shares by Mr. Pirro Vasil Kushi.

When the Foreign Shareholders subscribed to the Foreign Shares, they also paid the
requisite capital contribution. These payments were made in cash. The capital
contribution was divided in the following manner among the Foreign Shareholders:

- USD 4,000 by Mr. Declan J. Ganley;

- USD 1,000 by Mr. Stephan A. Murphy;
- USD 1,000 by Mr. Don N. De Marino;
- USD 4,000 by Mr. Michael Beck.

The validity and accuracy of the Judicial Registration Order are not in dispute, and the
Tribunal is therefore satisfied that this requirement has been met: a foreign investment
exists in accordance with the definition of Art. 1 LFI. And this foreign investment
consists in the Foreign Shares, the 200 shares in the AAIF owned by the Foreign
Investors, which the Foreign Shareholders subscribed in exchange for a capital
contribution of USD 10,000.

Foreign investor

The second requirement set out by Art. 1 LFI consists of the existence of a “foreign
investor”.

Pursuant to the definition contained in Art. 1 LFI, a “foreign investor” is

“c) every legal person established in accordance with the law of a foreign country,
who directly or indirectly seeks to carry out or is carrying out an investment in the
territory of the Republic of Albania in conformity with its laws, or has carried out
an investment in conformity with its laws during the period from 31.07.1990 to the
present”.

The evidence in the record shows that Claimant in this case, AAG, is indeed a legal
person constituted in accordance with the laws of a foreign country. To this effect,
Claimant has presented a Certificate of Good Standing, dated June 9, 2017, showing
that AAG is a limited liability company incorporated and operating under the laws of

47

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

the British Virgin Islands with its legal seat in the British Virgin Islands and was deemed
to exist at all relevant times!*.

221. Therefore, the Tribunal is satisfied that Claimant qualifies as a protected investor under
Art. | LFI'®®,

c.  Claimant’s ownership of the investment

222. There is a third requirement that must be met: the protected investment must be owned
(or title must be held), not by any qualifying foreign investor, but by the foreign investor
who is acting as claimant in the arbitration.

223. In the Tribunal’s opinion, this third requirement is not satisfied in the present case.

224. The Judicial Registration Order proves that the Foreign Shareholders, by subscribing
and paying for the shares, validly acquired a protected investment, 50% of the
shareholding in the AAIF. But the Foreign Shareholders are not acting as claimants in
this procedure. The entity which appears as Claimant is AAG, and in the Tribunal’s
view AAG has failed to prove that it validly acquired, from the Foreign Shareholders,
ownership of (or any other title over) the protected investment.

Evidence marshalled by Claimant

225. AAG argues that the Foreign Shareholders transferred, through declarations of trust,
beneficial ownership of the AAIF Foreign Shares to AAG, with the result that the
Foreign Shareholders now hold these shares in trust for Claimant!>’.

226. The common law institution of “trust” is, generally speaking, a legal relationship
created by a “settlor” by which assets (known as “res” or “corpus”) are placed in the
ownership of a “trustee” for the benefit of a “beneficiary”. In the concise definition of
Black’s Law Dictionary, a trust is

“a property interest held by one person (the trustee) at the request of another (the
settlor) for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary)”'**.

227. A key characteristic of a trust is that it permits the separation of legal ownership and
beneficial interest: the trustee becomes the owner of the corpus, and the beneficiary or
beneficiaries are entitled to expect that the trustees will manage the trust property for

155 RFA, para. 5 and C-1 and C-57.
156 AAG remained in dissolutior ‘tus from October 31, 2011, until June 1, 2017, when the Eastern Caribbean
Supreme Court of the BVI ordered its “restoration and re-registration” (R-25 and C-67). The Order is clear that
AAG is deemed to have never been dissolved or struck off the Registry of Corporate Affairs. The Order reads:
“1. The dissolution of Anglo Adriatic Group Limited (the Company) on October 31, 2011 is void and of no
effect pursuant to para. 57 of Schedule 2 of the BVI Business Companies, 2007. [...] 4. The Company is deemed
never to have been dissolved or struck off the register in accordance with the BVI Business Companies Act 2004
section 218(3)”.

their benefit. To create an inter vivos trust, the settlor typically has to execute a deed
(known as “trust deed”), which formalizes the transfer of the property from settlor to
trustee and identifies the beneficiary!’

In this case, Claimant has provided as evidence four Trust Deeds 160 which are all based

on the same standard text. In each of the four Trust Deeds the corpus consists of the
Foreign Shares of the AAIF, and in each of the Trust Deeds AAG appears both as the
settlor and well as the beneficiary. The main difference between the four Trust Deeds
is the identity of the trustee: each Trust Deed shows one Foreign Shareholder as the
trustee. The corpus in each of the Trust Deeds is precisely the number of Foreign Shares
in the AAIF which the Foreign Shareholder subscribed and paid in.

Additionally, AAG has submitted four one-page letters from Mr. Patrick G. Flynn, an
English solicitor, who states that he

- has reviewed each Trust Deed and

- confirms that the governing law of the Trust Deeds is that of England and Wales
and that under the laws of England and Wales, the Trust Deeds are legally valid
and enforceable '®!.

The Tribunal’s analysis

The Tribunal is not persuaded that this evidence proves quod demonstrandum erat.

To validly create a trust, the settlor, who must be the owner of the property, must
transfer ownership to the trustee, who will hold the corpus for the benefit of a third
party. In the present case, the owners of the AATF shares were the Foreign Shareholders,
and thus the only persons entitled to act as settlors.

But this is not the reality which the Trust Deeds represent.

In the four Trust Deeds, it is Claimant (not the Foreign Shareholders) who acts as settlor.
The Trust Deeds, on their face, prove the transfer of ownership from settlor (AAG) to
the trustees (the Foreign Shareholders) for the benefit of the beneficiary (again AAG).
This is the opposite of what Claimant is trying to prove: i.e. the transfer of ownership
from the Foreign Shareholders to AAG.

The necessary conclusion is that the Trust Deeds do not support Claimant’s case that
the Foreign Shareholders transferred beneficial ownership over the Foreign Shares to
AAG.

159 See, e.g. RL-66 and RL-67.

160 ‘Trust agreement, dated November 2, 1996, between Claimant and Mr. Declan Ganley (C-58); Trust
agreement, dated November 2, 1996, between Claimant and Mr. Don De Marino (C-59); Trust agreement, dated
October 16, 1996, between Claimant and Mr. Michael Beck (C-60); and Trust agreement, dated October 1, 1996,
between Claimant and Mr. Stephen Murphy (C-61).

. Claimant’s explanation for this mishap is that Counsel to AAG and to the Foreign

Shareholders allegedly committed a mistake when preparing the Trust Deeds: the
settlors should have been the Foreign Shareholders (and not AAG, as the Trust Deeds
state by mistake), because the actual intent of the parties was to establish a trust
relationship in which the Foreign Shareholders, through a self-declaration of trust,
placed their AATF shares in their own trust, for the benefit of AAG (beneficiary of the
trust)!®,

The Tribunal remains unconvinced.

First, there is no evidence that proves that counsel to AAG and the Foreign Shareholders
indeed committed a mistake when drafting the Trust Deeds.

 

. To the contrary, the only additional evidence marshalled by Claimant are four legal

opinions prepared by a legal expert, confirming that the four Trust Deeds are legally
valid and enforceable!®. There is no indication in these legal opinions that counsel
committed a mistake when formalizing the Trust Deeds. And there is no other evidence
which supports this conclusion.

Second, Arts. 2.2 and 6.4 LIFd provided that all rights in the shares of a fund must be
held by the registered shareholders of these shares; the law further required that the
transfer of any shares in the AAIF should be registered with the Albanian authorities
within 10 days and that the identity of the shareholders had to be reported on an ongoing
basis every quarter (Arts. 6.4(a) and 16.1 LIFd).

There is no evidence in the record that either the AAIF or AAG ever informed the
Albanian authorities that the Foreign Shareholders had transferred ownership of the
AAIF Foreign Shares to AAG, or that AAG asked for registration as a new shareholder.
The absence of such information and the inexistence of registration — both of which are
required under Albanian law — undermines the credibility of Claimant’s argument that
AAG was the beneficial owner of the shares since 1996.

Claimant has also failed to offer any evidence showing that the Albanian authorities
were aware that the beneficial owner of the Foreign Shares was AAG - and not the
Foreign Shareholders.

Third, even if it is accepted arguendo
- that counsel indeed committed a mistake when drafting the Trust Deeds,

- that the real settlors and trustees of the Trust Deeds were the Foreign Shareholders
and that the beneficiary was AAG,

- and that the omission of information and registration was a mere oversight,

ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

there would still be no evidence proving that AAG had paid the appropriate
consideration to the Foreign Shareholders in exchange for the transfer of the AAIF
shares.

The Foreign Shareholders have testified that they paid a total of USD 10,000 as capital
contribution for the subscription of the Foreign Shares, and that these funds were
effectively paid in cash to the AAIF. When the Foreign Shareholders allegedly
transferred the shares to AAG, an equivalent consideration should have been paid by
AAG.

AAG has failed to provide any evidence that such payments were actually made.

This failure is especially striking, because it should have been easy for AAG, a
corporation with a duty to keep accounts, to prove the existence of such payments (e.g.
by submitting its accounting books or certificates from the bank which handled the
payments). The Tribunal agrees with Albania that the record does not show Claimant
paying any

“consideration under the Alleged Trust Deeds in return for (allegedly) receiving
beneficial ownership of shares in AAIF'™.

Several investment tribunals have concluded that investors who had not paid any
consideration, or only a nominal price, were not entitled to investment protection. In KT
Asia, a case where the investor had not made any payment as consideration for the
investment, the tribunal reached the following conclusion, which coincides with the
findings of this Tribunal:

“Tn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that KT Asia has made no contribution with
respect to its alleged investment, nor is there any evidence that it had the intention
or the ability to do so in the future. As a consequence, the Claimant has not
demonstrated the existence of an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention and under the BIT. This suffices to rule out jurisdiction over the
present dispute”!®.

KK

In conclusion, the evidence in the record shows that the Foreign Shareholders duly
acquired the AAIF Foreign Shares and paid in the appropriate consideration. Claimant
has however failed to prove that the Foreign Shareholders validly transferred ownership
(or other title) over the Foreign Shares to AAG, or that AAG paid any consideration to
the Foreign Shareholders in exchange for such Foreign Shares. Since Claimant has
failed to prove that it is the owner (or other titleholder) of the Foreign Shares, the
necessary conclusion is that Claimant has no standing to bring claims under Arts. 1 and
8 LFI with regard to the AAIF Foreign Shares.

3. SECOND ALLEGED INVESTMENT: CLAIMANT’S FUNDING TO THE AAIF

248. Claimant contends that it made a second qualifying investment in Albania under Art. 1
LFI between 1994 and 2000 when AAG allegedly provided the AAIF with USD
5,334,133 in loans, which were meant to cover its operating expenses !®°.

249. To prove the existence of these loans, Claimant has introduced a document titled
“Ongoing Funding Agreement”, dated July 3, 1996 [the “Ongoing Funding
Agreement |'°’.

250. In the next subsections the Tribunal summarizes Albania’s position (A.) and Claimant’s
position (B.), and then concludes that Claimant has not made a qualifying investment
under Arts. 1 and 8 LFI (C.).

A. Albania’s position

251. Albania opposes this claim and avers that Claimant has not proved that it actually
provided any money to the AAIF, for the following reasons.

252. First, Albania does not accept the authenticity of the Ongoing Funding Agreement!“

253. Second, Albania argues that, at any rate, the Ongoing Funding Agreement does not
prove the provision of any money by Claimant to the AAIF, as it merely refers to the
possibility of supplying money in the future “as and when funding is available”!®.

254. Third, Claimant has not put forward any of its financial records (or those of the AATF),
which would have reflected the existence of the alleged payments, had they been made;
not even at the request of the Tribunal during the Hearing!””.

255. Fourth, Mr. Kushi, who was the “country manager” of the AAIF!"!, testified at the
Hearing that he did not remember receiving any loans from Claimant!”*. Several
witnesses of Claimant’s testified that, to the extent the AAIF received external funding,
this came from Ganley International Limited (GIL) — not from Claimant!”?.

256. Fifth, even assuming that Claimant did provide funding to the AAIF, this would not
constitute a protected investment because, on Claimant’s own description, such funds
were used merely to cover development costs!”+. The only types of operating expenses
identified by Claimant’ s witnesses at the Hearing were developmental in nature!”, such

as money for the collection of the vouchers and the pursuit of privatization opportunities
as pre-investment activities, designed to enable a subsequent investment in a major
privatized asset. Any costs that Claimant may have incurred during this process do not
amount to a protected investment!”°,

Sixth, assuming that Claimant were able to establish that it did provide funding, the
investment would be illegal and in breach of the LIFd'’’. AAG claims that the USD
5,334,113 were provided “as a fully repayable loan” !78, However, under Art. 13.1 LIFd,
funds were not entitled to borrow money or take loans of any kind. Therefore the loans
allegedly provided by Claimant would make its alleged investment illegal and,
therefore, would not qualify as a protected investment under the LFI!”’.

. In conclusion, there is no evidence of any funding from Claimant to the AAIF, which

would not otherwise constitute an illegal and unprotected investment. Claimant has
failed to satisfy its burden of proof!*°.

Claimant’s position

AAG submits that it paid the AAIF USD 5,334,113, and that such funding constitutes
a protected investment!*!.

First, Claimant did make substantial investments in the territory of Albania, not only by
owning shares in the AAIF, but also by funding the AAIF’s operating expenses such as:
- the establishment of the voucher collection centers,

- the advertising of the collection process,

- the employment of the Albanian collection staff, and

- payments to the third parties who provided the premises for the collection

centers !*?,

Second, Claimant has submitted the Ongoing Funding Agreement and a document titled
“Calculation of Operating Cost. Operating costs of AATF during the years 1994 through

and including 2000” (C-35), which show that operating expenses amounting to USD
5,334,113 have been paid by Claimant to the AAIF. Also, Mr. Hunter and Mr. Ganley

testified consistently at the Hearing that Claimant contributed to cover the operation
expenses of the AAIF!*?.

Third, both Claimant and the AAIF kept some form of balance sheets or other financial
records '*4, The fact that Albania’s expert could not find evidence for the actual payment
of the operating costs does not mean that such amount was not paid. In fact, Albania’s
expert admitted that AAG has no obligation to prepare or file company account with
the Registrar of Corporate Affairs of the British Virgin Islands'**.

Fourth, the operating expenses were paid on the basis of the Ongoing Funding
Agreement, but without the obligation of full repayment. Thus, the operating expenses
constitute a right arising out of a contract and therefore a protected investment in
accordance with Art. 1 LFI'%*, The funding of the operating costs pursuant to the
Ongoing Funding Agreement'*’ constitutes both a loan and right arising out of a
contract!’

Fifth, in any case, assuming that the operating costs constitute a loan within the meaning
of Art. 13.1 LIFd'*®®, such statutory provision would not be applicable. The LIFd was
repealed by Law No. 10198, of December 10, 2009, on Collective Investment
Undertakings!°°, which does not contain a prohibition of taking loans'?!.

 

 

[Albania replies that the Law was in force when the Ongoing Funding Agreement was
made (on 30 June 1996) and during the entire period during which Claimant alleges to
have provided funding in the form of loans: from 1996 to 2000!°?.]

Tribunal’s analysis

AAG claims to have made a second qualifying investment in Albania under Art. 1 LFI:
from 1994 to 2000 Claimant allegedly provided USD 5.33 million to the AAIF to cover
its operating expenses!**. Albania replies that AAG has not proved having provided any
money to the AATF.

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

. The Tribunal sides with Albania for the following reasons.

268.

As explained in the previous section (see section VI.2.C), for the Tribunal to have
jurisdiction, Arts. 1 and 8 LFI require the fulfilment of three requirements: existence of
a protected investment; existence of a protected investor; and that the protected investor
is the titleholder or owner of the protected investment.

Had Claimant made loans to the AAIF for over USD 5.33 million, such contributions
would qualify as a “foreign investment” under the LFI. Loans are indeed included in
the categories of protected investments under Art. 1(3)(c) LFI:

“Joans, monetary obligations or obligations in an activity of an economic value and
related to an investment”.

In this case, however, and after examining the evidence, the Tribunal concludes that
Claimant has not proved the first requirement, i.e., the existence of a protected
investment.

After reviewing the record, the Tribunal has not found any convincing evidence that
Claimant has actually carried out such funding.

Assessment of the evidence submitted

Claimant has submitted two pieces of evidence to allegedly show the payment from
Claimant to the AAIF: the Ongoing Funding Agreement! and a document titled
“Calculation of Operating Cost. Operating costs of AATF during the years 1994 through
and including 2000”!°.

Ongoing Funding Agreement
As for the Ongoing Funding Agreement, the Tribunal agrees with Albania that this
document does not prove the provision of any money by Claimant to the AATF.

The very short document, drafted in the form of a letter, merely refers to the possibility
of supplying money in the future “as and when funding is available”!°®. The document
is signed by Declan J. Ganley, “for and on behalf of Anglo Adriatic Group Ltd” and by
a Director (“Fully Agreed and Accepted by Anglo Adriatic Investment Fund SA”)
whose signature is not legible.

It reads as follows:

Further to our various discussions Anglo Adriatic Group Ltd. hereby agrees to
supply funding to Anglo Adriatic Investment Fund SA. both in country and on
behalf of Anglo Adriatic Investment Fund SA. international activities, on an
ongoing basis and, as and when funding is available. The loans are fully repayable
on demand.

Anglo Adriatic Group Ltd. and Anglo Adriatic Investment Fund SA both agree
that these funds will be treated as loans from Anglo Adriatic Group Ltd to Anglo
Adriatic Investment Fund SA.

Presuming your acceptance and agreement to this, please complete the section
below and return an original copy”!®”.

Other evidence

As for the document titled “Calculation of Operating Cost. Operating costs of AAIF
during the years 1994 through and including 2000”, it is simply a one-page spreadsheet
which starts with the cumulative operating expenses figure of USD 5,334,113, and then
shows the increase in the present value of this amount from 2000 to 2015, based on the
application of compound annual interest at a rate of 5% per year.

The document has one fund: | weakness: it quod de dum erat. It

accepts as a starting point (without providing any support) that the principal of the loan
amounted to USD 5,334,113, and then calculates the interest which would have accrued
between 2000 and 2015. As Albania correctly observes, the document contains no
explanation or documentary support as to what operating costs were actually incurred
by the AAIF, when such costs were incurred by the AAIF, or how or when such costs
were “covered” by Claimant!*®.

Apart from this evidence, AAG has not marshalled any other proof.

This is all the more surprising, because it should be easy for a company to provide
convincing evidence of the fact that it granted a loan of more than USD 5 million to a
certain borrower. Good business practice requires that loans for such amounts be
properly formalized. Moreover, the transfer of funds can be easily proven through the
introduction of bank certificates or accounting statements. Finally, in this case, both the
lender and the borrower are companies which must draw up and approve annual
accounts, reflecting their assets and liabilities. It is especially telling that Claimant has
failed to produce either its own annual accounts or those of the AAIF.

The Tribunal concludes that Claimant has failed to prove that AAG provided any loan
to the AAIF.

Additional argument: illegality

Furthermore, even if it is assumed ad arguendum that Claimant did facilitate a loan to
the AAIF, such investment would not qualify as a protected foreign investment under
the LFI, since it would have been made in breach of Albanian law.

As explained above, Art. 1 LFI requires that foreign investors carry out an investment
in the territory of the Republic of Albania in conformity with its laws. The language of
the statute reads as follows:

“Foreign investor” means: . . . c) every legal person established in accordance with
the law of a foreign country, who directly or indirectly seeks to carry out or is
carrying out an investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania in
conformity with its laws, or has carried out an investment in conformity with its
laws during the period from 31.07.1990 to the present”. [Emphasis added]

Albania argues that the loan would be illegal because the LIFd (the statute in force at
the time the investment was made) expressly barred investment funds from borrowing
money or taking loans of any kind. The relevant provision (Art. 13.1 LIFd) reads as
follows:

“13.1. An investment fund is not entitled to perform the following actions:
LJ
- To borrow money or take loans of any kind”. [Emphasis added]

The Tribunal concurs.

If AAG had indeed provided any type of financing to the AAIF, such asset would never
qualify as a protected investment, because the investment would have been made in
breach of Art. 13.1 LIFd.

The Tribunal’s conclusion is based on the following reasons.

First, only investments made in accordance with Albanian law can enjoy the protection
granted under the LFI, as Art. 1 LFI makes clear. The subject-matter of a dispute arising
out of an illegal investment falls outside the scope of Albania’s consent to arbitrate.
Investment tribunals have come to analogous conclusions in similar contexts!’.

Second, this loss of protection is all the more clear where there is a relevant public
purpose, which justifies the proportionality between the breach and the sanction of
depriving an investor from international protection.

In this case, the duty that the investor assumingly breached was Art. 13.1 LIFd, which
prohibited investment funds from borrowing money or taking loans. This was only one

of many other restrictions that the Albanian legislative imposed on the operation of
investment funds. As explained earlier, funds could only operate after obtaining an
administrative license, and their activity was subject to a number of requirements and
restrictions. Article 13 LIFd listed a few of them:

“ARTICLE 13.

13.1 An investment fund is not entitled to perform the following actions:

- To invest more than 10 percent of its net assets in the shares of a sole entity.

- To invest in shares issued by other investment funds.

- To invest in any entity owning more than 5 percent of fund’s shares.

- To accept to sell shares that it doesn’t own.

- To borrow money or take loans of any kind.

- To grant guarantees or promises of any kind.

- To have ownership or debt interests to its directors and its depositor, its
accounting expert.

13.2 An investment fund is not entitled to perform also these actions:

- To own other assets, except the Albanian currency, privatization vouchers, shares
in joint stock companies.

- To invest in any company that is not engaged in commercial activity in Albania.
- To trade or possess privatization vouchers in other ways, except the exchange of
shares issued as a result of privatization or transformation of state-owned
enterprises.

- To grant credits or loans.

- To enter into agreements that are not related to the investment activity.

- To accept privatization vouchers in exchange of its shares, if the total nominal
value of the vouchers received by the investment fund and its branches would be
greater than 10 percent of the total nominal value of all privatization vouchers

issued in Albania until that time.

- To engage in other commercial activities, other than investments, reinvestments
and trading of shares.

- To carry out investments under the laws in force, except those stipulated in this
law”. [Emphasis added]

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

The language of the provision is clear: funds were not allowed, among other things, to
borrow money or receive loans, regardless of how such operations were structured.
Read in its context, the prohibition aimed at reducing insolvency risks. Funds authorized
to borrow money could eventually become unable to repay the amounts received,
leading to insolvency and to financial detriment to the participants. A prohibition of any
type of leverage significantly reduces the financial risk born by investors.

In addition to reducing financial risks, the prohibition in this case pursued an additional
— and significant — public interest. Since investment funds were entitled to directly
approach Albanian citizens and exchange their privatization vouchers against
participations in the fund, it was reasonable for the legislative to create a safe and strict
legal regime, protecting the general public from being deprived of their investments.

Summing up this argument, the prohibition on funds to incur indebtedness pursued a
compelling public purpose, which any investor was expected to know and observe. In
this context, it follows that — should AAG have provided any type of financing to the
AAIF - such asset would never qualify as a protected investment under Art. 1 LFI.

KK

In conclusion, Art. 13.1 LIFd prohibited funds from receiving any type of loans or
borrowing money. AAG allegedly lent more than USD 5 million to the AAIF. Claimant
has failed to prove the existence of such loan. Furthermore, even if such loan had
actually been provided, it could never achieve the status of protected investment under
the LFI. The prohibition contained in Art. 13.1 LIFd would in any case render the
investment illegal, excluding the asset from the scope of protection granted by the LFI.

FINAL CONCLUSION

The Tribunal has concluded that the evidence in the record proves that the subscription
of the Foreign Shares only resulted in the Foreign Shareholders, not Claimant, making
an investment in Albania. Claimant has failed to prove that it is the owner of (or
otherwise holds title in) the Foreign Shares.

Claimant has also failed to prove that it provided a loan in an amount of USD 5.33
million to the AAIF. In any case, Albanian law prohibited funds from obtaining loans
or borrowing money, and any loan granted by AAG to the AAIF would have run afoul
of such prohibition, rendering the investment without protection under the LIF.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has not made a protected investment
under Arts. 1 and 8 LFI. The corollary is that the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the
Tribunal, competence ratione materiae to adjudicate this dispute. Because the Tribunal
concludes that there is no investment under the LFI, there is no need for the Tribunal to
further address the issue of whether there is an investment for the purpose of the ICSID
Convention.

ARBITRATION COSTS

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and the
expenses of the Tribunal’s Assistant, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses
(“Arbitration Costs”], amount to:

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Juan Ferndndez-Armesto $105,271.33
Brigitte Stern $43,410.32
Georg von Segesser $47,004.37
Administrative Assistant to the $2,125.53
Tribunal’s expenses
ICSID’s administrative fees $74,000.00
Direct expenses $36,224.95
Total $308,036.50

TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“Tn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities
of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award”.

This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration,
including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The Tribunal has decided that it has no jurisdiction over the claims submitted by
Claimant. The arbitration therefore clearly had a successful party: Respondent.

But there are factors which justify Claimant’s decision to initiate this procedure.

The basic facts took place about twenty years ago, in the context of an emerging country
finding its way into the free-market economy. This process developed in a context of
social, legal, and political instability, which eventually led to a terrible civil war. The
destruction that followed and the passing of time may have resulted in the loss of
valuable evidence.

As a consequence, Claimant and its counsel were repeatedly forced throughout the
proceedings to correct previous statements, and to rectify factual inaccuracies. Although
this happened several times, the Tribunal sees no bad faith or recklessness, but simply
the difficulty to prove events which happened many years ago in a war-ravaged country.

62

Anglo-Adriatic Group v. Albania
ICSID Case No. ARB/17/6

307. More importantly, the Tribunal has not detected any element of perjury or frivolity in
Claimant’s arguments or the testimony of its witnesses. Although Claimant’s claims
have been dismissed, its position was not plainly unreasonable.

308. Considering all these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that the Arbitration Costs
shall be borne by Claimant, while each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses.

309. The Arbitration Costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal
parts. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders Claimant to reimburse Respondent the amounts
advanced by Respondent. Any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in
proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID, i.e., in equal parts.

310. Respondent has not sought any interest on these amounts, and therefore none is
granted?">,

311. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:

(1) Declares that the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence to
adjudicate the claims submitted by Anglo-Adriatic Group Limited;

(2) Decides that Anglo-Adriatic Group Limited shall bear the totality of the Arbitration
