A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

1. On September 14, 2006, a number of individuals and corporations claiming to hold
sovereign bonds issued by the Argentine Republic (“Claimants”) submitted a Request for
Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the

“Centre”) against the Argentine Republic (“Argentina” or “Respondent’).

2. On February 7, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes

between States and Nationals of Other States (“Convention”).

3. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on February 6, 2008. Its members were Dr. Robert
Briner, a Swiss national, appointed as President pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention,
Professor Georges Abi-Saab, an Egyptian national, appointed by Argentina, and Professor Albert
Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, appointed by the Claimants. Following the resignation of
Dr. Briner due to ill health, the Tribunal was reconstituted on September 2, 2009, with Professor
Pierre Tercier, also a Swiss national, being appointed as President of the Tribunal by agreement

of the parties.

4. Following written submissions, a hearing on jurisdiction took place in Washington D.C.
from April 7 to 13, 2010. On August 4, 2011, the Tribunal, by a majority composed of
Professors Tercier and van den Berg, issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. On
October 28, 2011, Professor Abi-Saab issued a Dissenting Opinion on the Decision on

Jurisdiction and Admissibility.

5. On September 15, 2011, Argentina submitted a Proposal to Disqualify Professors Tercier
and van den Berg under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. The proceeding was suspended
pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).

6. Professor Abi-Saab tendered his resignation from the Tribunal by letter dated November
1, 2011.
7. On December 21, 2011, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council rejected the

Proposal to Disqualify Professors Tercier and van den Berg, pursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID

Page |2

Convention. The proceeding was resumed on that same date in accordance with ICSID

Arbitration Rule 9(6).

8. On December 22, 2011, Professors Tercier and van den Berg consented to Professor Abi-

Saab’s resignation, as envisaged in ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2).

9. On January 19, 2012, the Tribunal was reconstituted, its members being
Professor Tercier, Professor van den Berg, and Dr. Santiago Torres Bernardez, a Spanish

national, appointed by Argentina to replace Professor Abi-Saab.
10. On May 9, 2012, the Tribunal held a procedural hearing in Washington D.C.

11. Between May 9, 2012 and November 4, 2013, the Tribunal has issued 13 Procedural

Orders and 3 set of Directions concerning the conduct of these proceedings. !

12. On July 7, 2012, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 12 concerning
the conduct of the proceedings and the procedural calendar. In this Procedural Order, the
Tribunal divided the steps leading to the hearing into two main phases: Phases 2 and 3. It further
divided Phase 2 into three sub-phases: Phases 2A and 2B, which would run in parallel, and

would later merge into Phase 2C.

13. In Phase 2A, the Claimants and the Respondent would file a Memorial and Counter-
Memorial setting forth their respective cases on liability and quantum. The Respondent could
also address issues of jurisdiction and admissibility but only to the extent that they had not been

addressed and decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.

14. Phase 2B would concern a verification of the Claimants’ database by one or more

independent experts to be appointed by the Tribunal (the “Database Verification Process’).

15. Procedural Order No. 12 granted the parties an opportunity to participate in the Database
Verification Process, and, to this end, to retain their own experts. Phase 2B was to be completed
by a report of the Independent Expert(s). Originally, this report was to be issued upon the filing
of Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on Phase 2. Phase 2B also envisaged a document production

phase that would follow the issuance of the expert(s) report.

16. Phases 2A and 2B would merge into Phase 2C after the conclusion of the document
production. In Phase 2C, the Claimants and the Respondent were to submit a Reply and
Rejoinder, respectively, which would address (i) issues of liability and quantum, (ii) jurisdiction
and admissibility, should the Respondent raise these in its Counter-Memorial on Phase 2B, and
(iii) any comments arising from the Database Verification Process. If the Respondent raised
issues of jurisdiction and admissibility in its Counter-Memorial, the Claimants could file a
Rejoinder on these issues. This exchange of written pleadings would be followed by a hearing

on Phase 2.

18. On September 27, 2012, the Tribunal, by majority, issued Procedural Order No. 13
addressing issues of confidentiality and the further conduct of the proceedings. In particular,
Procedural Order No. 13 granted the Claimants (i) the right to address issues of individual
jurisdiction in their Phase 2 Memorial and (ii) approval to amend the contents of the Database,
under specified conditions. Procedural Order No. 13 also extended the dates for submission of
the Claimants’ Memorial and the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial. Procedural Order No. 13
was accompanied by a Statement of Dissent issued by Dr. Torres Bernardez. Dr. Torres
Bernardez agreed with the extension granted, but considered that (i) the Claimants should not be
allowed to include issues of individual jurisdiction in their Phase 2 Memorial and file a
Rejoinder on jurisdiction and (ii) the entire schedule fixed in Procedural Order No. 12 should be

revised to factor the Database Verification Process in the sequence of pleadings.

19. The Claimants filed their Phase 2 Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits in English on

October 1, 2012. A translation into Spanish was filed on October 8, 2012.

20. On November 1, 2012, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 14,
extending the deadline for Argentina’s submission of its Counter-Memorial by one week, the
same additional time the Claimants had taken to submit the Spanish version of its Memorial on

Jurisdiction and Merits.

21. On November 20, 2012, the Tribunal, by majority, issued Procedural Order No. 15,
(i) appointing Dr. Norbert Wiihler, a German national, as the independent database verification
expert envisaged in Procedural Order No. 12; (ii) asking Dr. Wiihler to prepare a Work Proposal
to be presented to the parties and the Tribunal; and (iii) defining the scope of the expert’s
mandate, the terms of his retainer and the procedure applicable to his role. Procedural Order

No. 15 further modified the schedule for phases 2B and 2C.

27. Dr. Torres Berndrdez dissented from Procedural Order No. 17, objecting to the
procedural calendar, the appointment of Dr. Wiihler, and generally the Database Verification

Process.

28. On March 25, 2013, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 18

concerning production of documents.

29. On April 8, 2013, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 19 concerning
the conduct of the database verification process. Attached to Procedural Order No. 19 was a

letter from Professor Tercier noting the parties’ increasing failure to comply with the established

Page |8

timetable, and advising that the Tribunal would henceforth be stricter on time limits and requests

for extension of time.

30. On April 24, 2013, the Majority of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20
extending the deadline for the independent expert’s draft Database Verification Report until May
31, 2013. Dr. Wiihler had requested this extension due to delays caused by interruptions in
access to the Database. Dr. Torres Bernardez dissented from Procedural Order No. 20 on the

basis of his stated opposition to the Database Verification Process.

31. On May 2, 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21 concerning the
management of the Claimants’ Database and the procedural calendar, setting new dates as
follows:

i. Submission of the Draft Verification Report by Dr. Wiihler: May 31,

2013.

ii. | Comments by both parties: July 1, 2013.

iii. Issuance of Final Verification Report: July 15, 2013.

iv. All other deadlines are suspended.
Dr. Torres Bernardez dissented from Procedural Order No. 21 on the basis of his stated

opposition to the Database Verification Process.

32. By letter of July 22, 2013, the Tribunal gave each party the opportunity to comment on
the other party’s comments of July 15, 2013. The Tribunal established the following additional
steps concerning the Database Verification:
i. Each party to respond to the other party’s July 15, 2013 comments on the
Draft Verification Report: Deadline July 31, 2013.
ii. Issuance of Final Verification Report: Deadline August 31, 2013.
Dr. Torres Bernardez dissented from this letter on the basis of his stated opposition to the

Database Verification Process.

33. On July 30, 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22 regarding the
management of the Claimants’ Database. Dr. Torres Bernardez appended an Individual

Statement of Dissent to Procedural Order No. 22.

34. The Final Database Verification Report was issued by the Expert on August 31, 2013 and

transmitted to the parties on September 5, 2013.

35. On September 26, 2013, the Tribunal issued Directions to the parties, stating that it would
proceed as set out in Procedural Orders No. 15 and 17, while re-adjusting the relevant deadlines.

The Tribunal then set a modified schedule.

36. The Tribunal also advised the parties that the three arbitrators would be available for a

hearing during June 2014, and invited the parties to confirm the dates during that period on

which they would be available for the hearing.

37. Dr. Torres Bernardez dissented from the Tribunal’s Directions as to the above timetable
on the basis that it gave the Claimants the last opportunity to respond by filing a Rejoinder

Memorial on Jurisdiction contrary, in his view, to Rule 31 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

38. By letter of October 3, 2013, Argentina requested an 11-month extension to file its

Rejoinder Memorial, requesting the same time that the Claimants had for the filing of its Reply,

Page |10

and objected to the hearing dates proposed by the Tribunal, claiming Argentina had prior
commitments in other ICSID cases. By letter of October 9, 2013, the Claimants objected to
Argentina’s request and confirmed their agreement with the hearing dates proposed by the

Tribunal.

39. In its Directions of October 21, 2013, the majority of the Tribunal decided to hold the

hearing in the last two weeks of June, and stated:

The Arbitral Tribunal has taken note of Respondent’s schedule in the first half of
2013. It should be recalled that the hearing has been postponed various times
(POI7 [sic] of 7 July 2012: Jul/Sep/Oct 2013; PO 15 of 20 November 2012:
Oct/Nov 2013; POI7 of 8 February 2013: 18-30 November 2013; PO21 of 2 May
2013: calendar suspended). In order to ensure the progress of this arbitration, the
majority of the Arbitral Tribunal has decided to hold the hearing as suggested,
ie., in the last two weeks of June 2014.

Dr. Torres Bernardez dissented, indicating that Argentina should be granted an extension to file
its Rejoinder Memorial, that the calendar should be adjusted, and accordingly that the hearing

dates set by the Tribunal should be changed.

40. On October 24, 2013, Argentina reiterated its request for an 1 1-month extension to file its
Rejoinder.
Al. In its Directions of November 4, 2013, the Tribunal granted a 15-day extension requested

by the Claimants, and set a modified schedule.

Dr. Torres Bernardez approved the extension of time for filing the Reply requested by the
Claimants on the condition that a similar extension be granted to the Respondent, but rejected the
schedule because it allowed the Claimants to submit a further Rejoinder Memorial on

Jurisdiction.

42. By letter of November 20, 2013, Argentina repeated its objections, requesting an

extension to file its Rejoinder on October 4, 2014.

43. By letter of November 28, 2013, the Tribunal rejected Argentina’s requests for an

extension to file its Rejoinder Memorial on Phase 2, and stated:

“The Arbitral Tribunal does not find it justified or appropriate to rely on the number of
days between the filing of Respondent's Counter-Memorial and the filing of Claimants’
Reply Memorial to grant Respondent an exactly same amount of days for the filing of its
Rejoinder Memorial. Both Parties have been occupied with various aspects of these
proceedings, including most recently the Verification Process and the Database update
issues, which are both relevant for the next steps of the proceedings, so that it would be
inappropriate to assume that Claimants enjoyed 314 days to prepare their Reply
Memorial. The Arbitral Tribunal believes that the period of 10.5 weeks as of receipt of
Claimants' Reply Memorial is sufficient for Respondent to prepare its Rejoinder
Memorial. The Tribunal notes that the Parties are aware since the issuance of Order No.
15 of 20 November 2012 (containing the timetable including the Verification Process)
that the deadlines fixed for the filing of Claimants’ Reply Memorial in Phase 2 and
Respondent’s Rejoinder Memorial in Phase 2 are equally calculated as of the date of the
filing of the Final Verification Report (i.e., in Block 2C: ‘(2 months)’; see also Timetable
to POI7: in Block 2C: ‘(8 weeks)’.”

Dr. Torres Bernardez dissented from this decision.
44. By letter of November 29, 2013, Argentina reiterated its objections to the fixed schedule.

By email of December 13, 2013, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on Argentina’s

November 29 letter. The Claimants submitted comments on December 17, 2013.

45. On December 19, 2013, Argentina proposed the disqualification of Professors Tercier

and van den Berg, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration

Page |12

Rule 9 (“Proposal”). On that same date, the Centre informed the parties that the proceedings
were suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The

Centre also established a procedural calendar for the parties’ submissions on the Proposal.

46. In compliance with that procedural calendar, the Claimants replied to the Proposal on
December 27, 2013. Professors Tercier and van den Berg furnished a joint explanation on
December 30, 2013, as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). Both Parties submitted

additional comments on the Proposal on January 13, 2014.

B. PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY
PROFESSORS TERCIER AND VAN DEN BERG AND THE ARBITRATORS’
EXPLANATIONS

1. Argentina’s Proposal for Disqualification

47. Argentina’s arguments on the proposal to disqualify Professors Tercier and van den Berg
were set forth in its submissions of December 19, 2013 and January 13, 2014. These arguments

are summarized below.

48. Argentina argues that Professors Tercier and van den Berg manifestly lack the qualities
required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Argentina claims that the procedural
decisions on the briefing calendar demonstrates an “absolute lack of equality in the treatment
accorded to the parties to the detriment of the right of defense of the Argentine Republic which
clearly prevents the challenged arbitrators from being relied upon to exercise independent

judgment.”?

49. Argentina argues that the periods allowed by the Tribunal for each party to prepare its
defense in this case are disproportionate and result in a total lack of fairness in the treatment
accorded to the parties. Argentina bases this Proposal on the decision issued by the Majority of
the Tribunal on November 28, 2013 (the “Decision”) and the facts surrounding it. The

November 28, 2013 Decision confirmed the deadlines for the next submissions in the case.

* Proposal for the Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and Arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg of
December 19, 2013 (“Proposal”) (2. Observations on the Proposed Disqualification of President Pierre
Tercier and Arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg of January 13, 2014 (“Respondent’s Second
Submission”) {2.

Page |13

Argentina argues that this Decision means the Claimants had 314 days to prepare their Reply
Memorial on Phase 2 (calculated from the date they received the English translation of the
Argentine Republic’s Counter-Memorial on Phase 2), while Argentina would have 75 days to
prepare its Rejoinder Memorial on Phase 2 (calculated from the date it received the Spanish

translation of Claimants’ Reply on Phase 23

50. Argentina submits that it asked three times for the same time-limit as the Claimants, but
received an answer from the Tribunal rejecting the request only after its third request.*
Moreover, Argentina states that on one of these occasions, the Majority of the Tribunal granted
the Claimants’ a 15-day extension to file their Reply Memorial on Phase 2 while ignoring the
Respondent’s extension request. Argentina submits that this is a clear violation of the principle

of equal treatment by the Majority of the Tribunal.>

51. Argentina states that the Majority of the Tribunal has disregarded Argentina’s repeated
opposition to the case procedural calendar since it was established by Procedural Order No. 15 of
November 20, 2012.° Argentina also states that the Majority of the Tribunal ignored Argentina’s
numerous hearings and deadlines in other arbitrations when it fixed and confirmed this
schedule.” Argentina submits that it has been asking the Tribunal to set deadlines for the
submission of main pleadings that ensured equal treatment to the parties since December 14,

2012.8

52. Argentina argues that the Database Verification Process did not interfere substantially
with the Claimants’ overall ability to prepare their Reply Memorial on Phase 2. Argentina states
that both parties were allowed only one month to review the draft Report submitted by the
Independent Expert on May 31, 2013 and that the parties submitted their comments between July

15-31, 2013. Accordingly, Argentina submits that the time spent by the parties on the Database

Verification Process between Argentina’s Counter-Memorial and Claimants’ Reply does not

justify the difference in time allocated to each party to file their second round of pleadings.”

53. Argentina states that the Proposal to Disqualify is timely as it was triggered by the

communications from the Majority of the Tribunal of November 28 and December 13, 2013. 10

54. Argentina concludes that the manner in which Professors Tercier and van den Berg have
conducted the proceedings in this case breaches the principle of equal treatment and has caused

Argentina to lose confidence in their capacity to exercise independent and impartial judgment.'!
2. Claimants’ Observations

55. The Claimants’ arguments on the proposal to disqualify Professors Tercier and van den
Berg were set forth in their submissions of December 27, 2013 and January 13, 2014. These

arguments are summarized below.

56. The Claimants state that Professors Tercier and van den Berg’s impartiality and ability to
decide this case fairly has already been affirmed in this proceeding in response to Argentina’s
challenge in September 2011. They state that nothing has changed in the interim, and nothing in

Argentina’s Proposal demonstrates otherwise. R

57. The Claimants argue that a disagreement with a Tribunal ruling is not a valid basis for
arbitrator disqualification under the ICSID Convention. 'S The Claimants state that Argentina has
raised no objections to the character or conduct of the challenged arbitrators and that it has based

the present challenge “solely on its disagreement with the Tribunal’s procedural ruling with

respect to Argentina’s request for an extension of time.”

Page |15

58. The Claimants argue that Argentina’s claim that the refusal to grant its extension
constitutes a breach of the principle of equal treatment is meritless. They state that the eight
months following the filing of Argentina’s Counter-Memorial were dedicated to two matters
outside the briefing schedule: a months-long discovery phase and a months-long phase to
perform an independent review and verification of the Claimants’ Database. Accordingly,
“contrary to Argentina’s claims that its right to defense has not been respected, much of the

procedure implemented by the Tribunal has been dedicated precisely to ensuring that right.”!°

59. The Claimants state that the Database Verification Process was a lengthy process in
which both parties prepared multiple, comprehensive submissions with respect to the scope of
the expert’s work and the conclusions that he ultimately reached. '® Accordingly, the Claimants
disagree with Argentina’s assertion that the Claimants had eleven months to prepare their Reply

Memorial on Phase 2.'7

60. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has given both parties multiple opportunities to
present their arguments with respect to Argentina’s extension request, duly considered the
parties’ positions, and fully explained its reasons for rejecting Argentina’s request on November

28, 2013.'

6l. The Claimants submit that this Proposal was not filed “promptly” as required by the
ICSID Arbitration Rules and that Argentina waived its right to challenge the arbitrators. The
Claimants note that the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 on November 20, 2012, thirteen
months prior to the submission of Argentina’s Proposal, and that Argentina “failed to assert any
request for disqualification, or any intention to file, when the purported issue arose more than a
year ago.” They add that “Argentina had ample opportunity to file a disqualification request,”
and point to “Argentina’s tactical abuse of ICSID procedures to its advantage [...] by trying to

award itself additional time for the Rejoinder, in direct contravention of the Tribunal’s ruling.” ?

62. The Claimants conclude that Argentina’s Proposal is “groundless on its face” and must

not be permitted to extend the procedural calendar.”
3. Arbitrators’ Explanations

63. Professors Tercier and van den Berg provided a joint explanation stating that they had
complied with their duty to exercise independent judgment as required by Article 14(1) of the
ICSID Convention, and that “none of the grounds and circumstances invoked by the Respondent

in its Request relate to the exercise of [their] independent judgment.””!

Cc. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN
1. Request for Recommendation

64. Article 58 of the ICSID Convention states that the decision on any proposal to disqualify

the majority of arbitrators shall be taken by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.

65. Argentina has asked the Chairman to request a recommendation from a third party before

deciding the Proposal.” The Claimants have opposed this request.°

66. The Chairman has requested recommendations on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator
on rare occasions in the past, in light of the specific circumstances of the case at issue. In each
such case, the parties were informed that the final decision would be taken by the Chairman, as
prescribed by the Convention. The circumstances in this Proposal do not justify such a request.
Accordingly, the Chairman has decided the Proposal on the basis of the submissions presented
by the parties and the explanations provided by the challenged arbitrators, in accordance with

Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.
2. Timeliness

67. Arbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:

>! Professor Tercier’s and Professor van den Berg’s Joint Explanations.

» Proposal 47. Respondent’s Second Submission 42-43.

“A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article
57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding
is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its
reasons therefor.”

68. As the ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a
proposal for disqualification must be filed, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a

case by case basis.*4

69. In this case, Argentina filed the Proposal on December 19, 2013. It arose from a
November 28, 2013 Tribunal ruling on Argentina’s request for an extension of time and facts
surrounding that request. Such a time period falls within an acceptable range and hence, this

disqualification proposal was filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).
3. Merits

70. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any

member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:

“A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of
any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the
qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration
proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on
the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under
Section 2 of Chapter IV.”

71. A number of decisions have concluded that the word “manifest” in Article 57 of the

925

Convention means “evident” or “obvious,”~ and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged

lack of the required qualities can be perceived.°

Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia (December 13, 2013) (73

Page |18

72. The disqualification proposed in this case alleges that Professors Tercier and van den

Berg manifestly lack the qualities required by Article 14(1).
73. Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral
character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry
or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.
Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of
persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.”

74. While the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to “independent
judgment,” the Spanish version requires “imparcialidad de juicio” (impartiality of judgment). 7
Given that both versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both

impartial and independent.”*

75. Impartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence
is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both “protect
parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the

case.”

76. Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence

or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.*°

77. The legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an “objective
standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.” As a consequence,
the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the

requirements of the Convention. 3

78. The Respondent has referred to other sets of standards and guidelines in its arguments.

While these rules or guidelines may serve as useful references, the Chairman is bound by the

standard set forth in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance

with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.

79. This has been a lengthy arbitration and it is a complex proceeding. The Tribunal has
addressed numerous requests from both parties and has issued an extensive number of procedural
orders and directions to the parties. Each of the Tribunal’s rulings has been rendered following
thorough argument by each of the parties and due deliberation among the members of the
Tribunal. Some of these rulings have granted the requests of the parties, while others have

denied such requests.

80. The mere existence of an adverse ruling is insufficient to prove a manifest lack of
impartiality or independence, as required by Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention. If it
were otherwise, proceedings could continuously be interrupted by the unsuccessful party,

prolonging the arbitral process.

81. The Respondent’s disqualification proposal in this case was triggered by a procedural
ruling. This ruling, which included the reasons on which it was based, was adopted after
argument by both parties and due deliberation by the Tribunal. The Respondent is clearly
dissatisfied with the ruling in question. However, the ruling in itself and the surrounding facts
described in the Proposal do not prove a manifest lack of impartiality on the arbitrators who

rendered it.

82. In the Chairman’s view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the
November 28, 2013 ruling, and surrounding facts, would not conclude that they evidence a
manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Accordingly, the disqualification proposal must be rejected.

83. Having considered all of the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the parties, and
for the reasons stated above, the Chairman rejects the Argentine Republic’s Proposal to

Disqualify Professor Pierre Tercier and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg.
