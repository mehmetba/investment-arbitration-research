C. Brief Summary of the Dispute

1. Background

11. The present dispute arises out of investments by NovEnergia, NIP and Greentech
in Italian companies owning a total of 134 PV plants located in Italy. The
investments were made during the period from 2008 to 2013. Claimants allege
that they were induced to make those investments inter alia by Italian legislation,
regulatory decrees, and contractual provisions that provided financial incentives.
Foremost among those measures were the Conto Energia decrees providing for
incentive tariff premiums (fees added to the market price) lasting for a twenty-year
period starting from each PV plant’s connection to the grid and execution of an
agreement with the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE). Thereafter, beginning
in 2012, Italy implemented a series of measures that allegedly diminished the
value of the incentives and culminated in Law Decree No. 91/2014 of 24 June
2014 (the “Spalma-incentivi Decree’), which allegedly harmed Claimants and
their respective investments.

12. Claimants alleged that Italy accorded their investments unfair and inequitable
treatment, failed to observe obligations entered into with respect to their
investments, and unlawfully impaired their investments through unreasonable or
discriminatory measures, in breach of Article 10(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty

(“ECT”)? Claimants requested declaratory relief and damages in the amount of
EUR 25.06 million.’

13. Respondent raised jurisdictional objections, chief among which was that the ECT
is not applicable to investment disputes between EU investors and an EU Member
State. The EC, as a non-disputing intervening party, has echoed the “intra-EU
disputes” objection. As to the merits, Respondent asked that the Tribunal find that
the ECT was not breached and that Claimants’ requests for declaratory relief and
damages be rejected. Respondent’s arguments are addressed below.

2. Applicable Arbitration Rules

14. These proceedings have been conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules
of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (in force as of
1 January 2010) (the “SCC Rules”), supplemented by the First Procedural Order
dated 27 January 2016 (adjusted 20 July 2016) (“First Procedural Order”).

3. Place of Arbitration

15. As confirmed by the SCC in its letter dated 22 October 2015, the seat of the
arbitration was fixed as Stockholm, Sweden.

16. Oral hearings were held in Paris, France, in accordance with the Tribunal’s

discretion to hold hearings in a place other than the seat of the arbitration under
Article 20(2) of the SCC Rules and in agreement with the Parties.

4, Language of the Arbitration

17. The Tribunal determined that the procedural language of the arbitration was
English, pursuant to Article 21(1) of the SCC Rules.

On 7 July 2015, the Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration with the SCC
pursuant to Article 2 of the SCC Rules seeking to institute arbitral proceedings
under Article 26(4)(c) of the ECT, which provides that an Investor may submit
certain disputes meeting the requirements of Article 26 to an “arbitral proceeding
under the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.”

. On 15 September 2015, the Respondent filed its Answer to the Request for

Arbitration.

. In their Request for Arbitration, dated 7 July 2015, the Claimants appointed David

R. Haigh, Q.C. as a co-arbitrator.*

. By letter dated 9 October 2015, Respondent appointed Professor Giorgio

Sacerdoti as a co-arbitrator.

The Parties agreed that the chairperson of the Arbitral Tribunal (“Tribunal”)
would be jointly selected by the co-arbitrators, subject to agreement by the Parties.

. By letter dated 12 November 2015, the two co-arbitrators jointly appointed

Professor William W. Park as chairman of the Tribunal and the SCC confirmed
his appointment on 16 November 2015.

By letter dated 18 November 2015, the SCC confirmed that it had referred the
case file to the Tribunal.

On 19 December 2015, the Tribunal requested that the two sides submit comments
by 15 January 2016 on (i) the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to order that restrictions
beyond those contained in the SCC Rules be put in place regarding the making of
public statements, and (ii) the reasons why such additional restrictions should, or
should not, be ordered.

On 21 January 2016, the Tribunal held a telephone conference during which the
Parties discussed organizational matters, including the Parties’ positions regarding
confidentiality.

‘ Request for Arbitration dated 7 July 2015, { 81.

27. On 27 January 2016, the Tribunal issued the First Procedural Order setting forth a
procedural calendar providing for two rounds of pre-hearing memorials in which
the Parties were required to submit all evidence (factual exhibits, legal authorities,
witness statements, and expert reports) upon which they wished to rely. After
considering the Parties’ proposals regarding confidentiality, the Tribunal adopted
the following provisions in the First Procedural Order:

XIV. Confidentiality

54. The Tribunal confirms the confidentiality obligations included in
Article 46 of the SCC Rules and the law of the chosen seat in
Sweden.

55. In declining to impose broader confidentiality stipulations at this
time, the Tribunal remains open to consideration of more focused
confidentiality provisions which, for example, might protect
particular classes of documents.

28. In the First Procedural Order, the Tribunal determined that any decision regarding
bifurcation of the procedure into jurisdictional and merits phases would be
decided following submission of the first round of memorials, and after
consultation with the Parties.”

29. On | April 2016, Claimants filed their Statement of Claim according to Article 24
of the SCC Rules.

30. By letter dated 21 April 2016, the Tribunal requested that the time for rendering
the final awarded be extended. On 26 April 2016, the SCC granted an extension
until 29 December 2017.

31. On 20 July 2016, the Tribunal issued an amended First Procedural Order.®

32. On 15 September 2016, Respondent filed its Statement of Defense according to
Article 24 of the SCC Rules.

33. In its Statement of Defense, Respondent requested that the Tribunal bifurcate the
proceedings into separate jurisdictional and merits phases, requesting that the
Tribunal decide upon its jurisdiction first.’ In the alternative, Respondent
requested that the Tribunal suspend the arbitral proceedings pending a decision by

> First Procedural Order dated 27 January 2016, 9.

the Italian Constitutional Court regarding Article 26 of the Spalma-incentivi
Decree.*

On 10 October 2016, Claimants submitted Objections to Respondent’s Requests
for Bifurcation and Suspension.

. On 17 October 2016, Respondent submitted its Reply to Claimants’ Objections

regarding bifurcation and suspension.

On 21 October 2016, Claimants submitted their Rejoinder to Respondent’s Reply
on Bifurcation and Suspension.

By an order dated 31 October 2016, the Tribunal, upon consideration of the
Parties’ submissions, decided neither to bifurcate nor to suspend the proceedings.

On 16 December 2016, Claimants submitted their Reply Memorial.

By email on 21 December 2016, the EC submitted to the Tribunal an Application
of the EC for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party in these proceedings.

On 24 December 2016, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the EC’s application
and invited the Parties to provide observations on the EC’s application by 6
January 2017.

. On 6 January 2017, Claimants submitted their comments on the EC’s application

for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party.

On 9 January 2017, Respondent submitted its comments on the EC’s application
for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party. The Respondent’s submission of 9
January 2017 reiterated the Respondent’s request to bifurcate the proceedings.

. By an order dated 17 January 2017, the Tribunal granted leave for the EC to

intervene on a limited basis. The EC was permitted to file a written amicus curiae
submission, without oral presentation at hearings, without having access to the

® Statement of Defense, { 36.

evidentiary record in the arbitration, and without causing any delay in the hearings
fixed for June 2017. The Parties and the EC were directed to confer directly in
order to propose a mutually acceptable timetable for the EC’s intervention and the
Parties’ observations and to submit by 27 January 2017 a joint progress report on
their efforts to agree upon a timetable. The Tribunal, considering Respondent’s
additional request for bifurcation in its 9 January 2017 submission, again weighed
all of the relevant factors, including the EC’s intervention, and declined to order a
bifurcation of the proceedings.

44. By email exchanges on 26 January 2017, the Parties confirmed their agreement on
a time table for submission of the EC’s amicus curiae brief and the Parties’
respective comments. According to that agreement, the EC was to submit its
amicus curiae brief by 28 April 2017, but not before Respondent had submitted its
Rejoinder Memorial, and the Claimants and Respondent were to submit their
observations on the EC’s submissions simultaneously on 28 May 2017.

45. On 21 March 2017, the Tribunal suggested that the Parties liaise among
themselves to provide a joint and consolidated electronic file including all
substantive submissions organized by (i) pleadings, (ii) exhibits, (iii) witness
statements, (iv) expert reports, and (v) legal authorities, informing the parties that
the Tribunal would later discuss with the Parties the preparation of a common hard
copy for the hearings and a core bundle of key exhibits.

46. On 23 March 2017, the EC suggested to the Tribunal that the Parties make
available to the EC their respective lists of legal authorities already submitted in
the proceedings, so that the EC could limit its submission of new authorities to
only those not yet submitted by the Parties.

47. On 23 March 2017, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the EC’s suggestion
regarding the lists of legal authorities and invited the Parties to express their
observations on the matter. The Tribunal proposed that the Parties, subject to their
mutual agreement, may submit a common list of legal authorities to the EC.

48. On 27 March 2017, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder Memorial.

49. On 10 April 2017, pursuant to paragraph 25 of the First Procedural Order,’
Claimants designated the following fact and expert witnesses of Respondent
whom Claimants wished to examine at the hearing:

examination, and to provide a joint draft proposal for protocols by 5 June 2017.

by 5 June 2017. Also on 30 May 2017, the Tribunal invited Respondent to
comment on the status of its observations regarding the EC’s amicus curiae brief,
which were due on 28 May 2017.

. On 30 May 2017, in response to the Tribunal’s query regarding the status of

Respondent’s observations on the EC’s submission, Respondent commented that
“the position of the Commission largely coincide with that of Italy and
consequently the Respondent feels no need to further elaborate on individual
points.”

By letter of 6 June 2017, Claimants requested leave to introduce into the case
record the Italian Court of Cassation Decision (no. 10411) of 27 April 2017 and
the Pubblico Ministero/Procurer General’s brief submitted on 20 September 2016.

By email of 7 June 2017, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on
Claimants’ request by 18:00 CET on 12 June 2017.

On 8 June 2017, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing call with representatives of the
Parties.

By letter of 12 June 2017, Respondent submitted its observations on Claimants’
request for leave to introduce into the case record the Italian Court of Cassation
Decision (no. 10411) of 27 April 2017 and the Pubblico Ministero/Procurer
General’s brief submitted on 20 September 2016, objecting to admission of the
latter into the record.

By email of 12 June 2017, Claimants proposed a sequence for presentation of
Claimants’ witnesses and confirmed that Claimants would not require Professor
Enrico Laghi to appear to give testimony. Claimants confirmed that their
respective instructing representatives to attend the hearings would be Mr. Ottavio
Lavaggi for NovEnergia and Mr. Alessandro Reitelli for Greentech.

. By order of 13 June 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that, as agreed by the Parties,

Professor Enrico Laghi would not appear at the hearings. Additionally, the
Tribunal ordered that fact witnesses, other than instructing representatives and
experts who may be present in the hearing room at all times, be allowed to remain
in the hearing room only after providing their oral testimony. Further, the
Tribunal ordered that Respondent designate its instructing representative by close
of business on 21 June 2017, and invited Respondent to propose a sequence for

20

presentation of its witnesses by 19 June 2017. Finally, the Tribunal noted that
both sides had agreed to admit the Italian Court of Cassation decision (No. 10411)
of 27 April 2017, and decided to defer its decision on whether to admit the report
of the Pubblico Ministero/Procurer General until having a discussion with counsel
on the first day of the hearings.

62. By email of 19 June 2017, Respondent designated Mr. Daniele Bacchiocchi as its
instructing representative and submitted a proposed sequence for presentation of
its witnesses.

6.

ow

. On 20 June 2017, Respondent provided the Tribunal and the Claimants with a
letter from Respondent’s expert, Professor Giovanni Serges, stating that Professor
Serges would not attend the hearing due to other professional commitments.
Professor Serges had been scheduled for examination at the hearing on 30 June
2018.

64. From 26 to 30 June 2017, the Tribunal held a hearing at the ICC Hearing Centre
on 112 avenue Kléber, in Paris, France. Attending the hearing were:

65. The Parties did not at any time during the proceedings request leave to file post-
hearing briefs. At the hearing, the Tribunal did note on the record that it might
later ask further questions of the Parties as such questions might arise during
deliberations. '!

66. On 23 October 2017, the SCC confirmed that Jeremy M. Bloomenthal had been
appointed as an administrative secretary of the Tribunal.

67. By letter of 4 December 2017, the Tribunal requested that the date for rendering
the final award be extended until 30 May 2018. On 5 December 2017, the SCC
invited the Parties to comment on the Tribunal’s request by 8 December 2017. On
5 December 2017, in separate responses to the SCC’s letter, Respondent and
Claimants stated that they had no objections to the proposed extension. By letter
of 6 December 2017, the SCC granted an extension until 30 May 2018 for the
Tribunal to render the final award.

68. On 6 March 2018, the ECJ issued a judgment in the case of Slovak Republic v.
Achmea,'* the outcome of litigation discussed by the Parties in their submissions
on bifurcation and jurisdiction and, in particular, the Respondent’s prior request to
suspend the present arbitration pending the ECJ’s decision. On 7 March 2018, the
Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on any impact that the ECJ’s Slovak
Republic v. Achmea decision might have on the present arbitration. The Tribunal
fixed a time limit of fourteen (14) days from the date of the Tribunal’s
communication for the Parties to make submissions by simultaneous exchange.

69. On 12 March 2018, Claimants requested that the Tribunal admit to the record the
CJEU Advocate General’s Opinion of 19 September 2017 on Case C-284/16. On
12 March 2018, acknowledging receipt of Claimants’ request, the Tribunal and

invited Respondent to comment on Claimants’ request by no later than close of
business (CET) on 16 March 2018. On 14 March 2018, after receiving on that day
Respondent’s comment on Claimants’ request, the Tribunal admitted the Advocate
General’s Opinion into the record.

. Concerning the Parties’ comments on the 6 March 2018 CJEU decision in

Achmea, on 15 March 2018, Claimants requested leave to submit a very limited
number of additional legal authorities to respond to specific issues. On 16 March
2018, the Tribunal confirmed that each side would be allowed to “attach key legal
authorities essential to proper understanding of that CJEU decision and its
relevance for the current proceedings.”

. On 23 March 2018, the SCC transmitted to the Tribunal simultaneously the

respective submissions of Claimants and Respondent dated 22 March 2018
concerning the impact of the Achmea decision. The Parties’ submissions were
timely, as the Tribunal’s invitation of 7 March 2018 to file submissions was
received after midnight on 8th March, C.E.T., hence the last day to submit their
observations was on 22nd March.

By letter dated 17 April 2018, the Tribunal requested that the SCC extend the time
for rendering the final award in light of the Parties’ submissions on the Achmea
decision. On 20 April 2018, the SCC granted an extension until 30 June 2018.

. On 25 May 2018, Ms. Claire Hill, the court reporter for the June 2017 hearing,

communicated with the Tribunal in relation to an unpaid invoice issued to
Respondent for Respondent’s portion of the hearing transcription fees.

On 28 May 2018, the Tribunal directed the Parties to comment within seven
calendar days on the SCC Secretariat’s suggestion that, if the Respondent refuses
to pay the invoice, the SCC pay the invoice and claim the cost as an expense after
the award has been rendered.

. On 4 June 2018, Claimants commented that they did not object to the SCC’s

suggested course of action, barring an indication from Respondent that payment
would be immediately forthcoming.

. Respondent did not provide any comments in response to the Tribunal’s direction

of 28 May 2018.

24

77. On 4 June 2018, Claimants sought leave to introduce into the record the 16 May
2018 award in Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief v. Spain," proposing that the
Parties be permitted to submit comments not exceeding five pages within one or
two weeks’ time. Claimants asserted that introduction of the Masdar award was
appropriate because:

1) the Masdar tribunal directly addresses the subject of the parties’
submissions on Achmea dated 22 March 2018, 2) the Masdar award
post-dates those submissions, and 3) the Masdar award is the only
ECT award (to date) that has addressed the relevance (or lack
thereof) of the ECJ’s Achmea decision to an ECT arbitration....

78. On 5 June 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment by 12 June 2018 on
Claimants’ request concerning the Masdar award.

79. By email on 12 June 2018, Respondent stated that it agreed with the proposal to
introduce the Masdar award and requested leave to comment on the merits in
addition to the jurisdictional aspects on which it understood Claimants wished to
make comments. Respondent stated that it would need more than five pages in
which to make its comments and that the two-week time limit proposed would be
insufficient in light of its obligations in other cases.

80. On 13 June 2018, the Tribunal acknowledged Respondent’s agreement with
Claimants’ request for leave to introduce and submit comments on the Masdar
award. The Tribunal, noting the divergence between Claimants and Respondent
as to the timing, length, and scope of the comments, directed counsel to confer
immediately and file a joint proposal not later than 18 June 2018. The Tribunal
also reminded Respondent of the Tribunal’s earlier request for attention to the
unpaid portion of fees for Ms. Claire Hill, the court reporter.

81. On 15 June 2018, Claimants stated that the Parties had conferred on the timing,
length, and scope of their proposed comments, and had agreed to simultaneously
submit on 6 July 2018 comments not limited in scope and not to exceed fifteen
pages. Later that same day, the Tribunal approved the Parties’ agreement
regarding submissions on the Masdar award, subject to Respondent confirming its
agreement to those conditions.

82. Also on 15 June 2018, the Tribunal requested that the SCC extend the time for
rendering the final award in light of the Parties’ intention to file new submissions

. On 9 July 2018, Respondent objected to Claimants’ reference, in their comments
on the Masdar award, to an award in Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg et
al. v. Spain, and requested leave to comment on the Antin award and also on the
award in Antaris Solar et al. v. Czech Republic. 4

n

. Also on 9 July 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, provisionally granting
Respondent leave to comment on the Antin award within ten days thence, subject
to a principled objection from Claimants.

86. On 11 July 2018, Claimants responded to Respondent’s objections regarding the
Antin award and to Respondent’s request to submit comments on the Antin and
Antaris awards. Claimants expressed the view that further submissions were not
necessary and would risk prolonging the case indefinitely, as other awards
involving renewable energy investments were likely to be rendered soon.
Claimants proposed, if further comments were to be allowed, that they be
submitted simultaneously on 20 July 2018, and that the proceedings be closed
thereafter.

87. On 13 July 2018, the Tribunal granted each side the opportunity to file
simultaneously, at 15:00 Central European Time on 20 July 2018, its final set of
comments touching on the Antin and Antaris awards. The Tribunal directed that
no further submissions would be allowed after that filing, “absent special
permission from the Tribunal on an application submitted for good cause shown.”

88. On 20 July 2018, the Parties submitted their respective comments regarding the
Antin and Antaris awards.

89. On 24 July 2018, Respondent sought leave to introduce into the record the EC’s
Communication of 19 July 2018 on protection of intra-EU investment,'> which
Respondent asserted it had been unable to submit earlier. According to
Respondent, the Communication is material to the arbitration because it:

... articulat[es] on protection of rights of EU investors when making
investments within the European Union to be compared to investment
protection ensured by international investment treaties, as well as the
implications of the ECJ Achmea decision for the interpretation of the
ECT (Press release (IP/18/4528).

Also, according to Respondent:

The European Commission is the guardian of EU treaties and
consequently this document is of extreme relevance in the assessment
of issues such as the relationships between the EU treaties and the
ECT, and interpretation of Article 16 ECT.

90. On 29 July 2018, in response to Respondent’s request, the Tribunal invited the
Parties to submit simultaneously any observations on the EC’s 19 July 2018
Communication and its admission in this case, directing the Parties to coordinate
the precise timing and modality of their simultaneous submissions. The Tribunal
noted that Section 31 of the First Procedural Order only allows admission of
additional evidence on an exceptional basis and at the Tribunal’s discretion.
Further, the Tribunal noted that its 13 July 2018 direction strictly limited any
further submissions by the Parties after their comments on the Antin and Antaris
awards. Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered:

Following these simultaneous observations no further submissions
shall be made or documents admitted absent an extraordinary and
exceptional showing of good cause.

91. On 1 August 2018, the Tribunal requested that the SCC extend the time for
rendering the final award, in light of submissions filed by the Parties on 6 July and
20 July, submissions expected to be filed in August regarding the EC’s
Communication of 19 July 2018 (COM(2018) 547/2), and the need for the
Tribunal to consider and address the Parties’ views prior to rendering its award.

Also on | August 2018, the SCC granted the Tribunal’s request, fixing the time
for rendering the award as 31 October 2018.

By email of 7 August 2018, Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Parties’
agreement that each side would file comments, limited to two pages, regarding the
EC’s 19 July 2018 Communication, by submitting their respective comments to
the SCC on 8 August 2018. Claimants requested that the SCC transmit the
submissions to the Tribunal after receiving both sets of comments.

By email of 9 August 2018, the SCC transmitted to the Tribunal the Parties’
respective comments, dated 8 August 2018, regarding the EC’s 19 July 2018
Communication.

On 3 October 2018, the EC wrote to the Tribunal stating inter alia that “the
Commission would be available to up-date its written observations in the light of
judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-284/16 Achmea v Slovak
Republic, and in particular to set out its view on the consequences of that
judgment for pending arbitration cases based on the Energy Charter Treaty.”

By letter dated 16 October 2018, the SCC transmitted to the Parties the Tribunal’s
proposal to extend the time for rendering the final award, to which both sides
expressed that they had no objection.

By letter dated 19 October 2018, the SCC fixed the date for rendering the award as
2 January 2019.

By an Order dated 16 October 2018, the Tribunal decided not to admit additional
observations from the EC regarding the ECJ’s judgment in Achmea v. Slovak
Republic, noting that the Parties had already filed multiple observations
addressing the ECJ’s judgment and that, as such, additional observations would
not be helpful.

Also on 16 October 2018, the Tribunal directed each side to file a cost submission
by simultaneous exchange on 25 October 2018, and each side to file a response to
the other side’s cost submission by simultaneous exchange on 5 November 2018.
The Tribunal further directed that, “Upon the Tribunal’s receipt of the response
cost submissions, the proceedings will be closed pursuant to Article 34 of the
2010 SCC Arbitration Rules.”

On 25 October 2018, Claimants filed their cost submission. Respondent filed its
cost submission on 29 October 2018.

28

100. On5 November 2018, Claimant filed a response on cost submissions. On 9
November 2018, Respondent confirmed that it had no objection to Claimants’
statement of costs, and filed a further comment on certain payment difficulties.

101. Being satisfied that the Parties have had a reasonable opportunity to present
their cases, the Tribunal, on 10 November 2018 declared the proceedings closed
pursuant to the SCC Rules.

102. On 7 December 2018, the SCC determined the costs of the arbitration,
discussed below further.

Il. Factual Background

A. Introduction

103. This section provides a brief background and summary of the regulatory
framework in force when the investments were made; a description of Claimants’
investments; and a summary of the legal measures from 2012 to 2015 on which
Claimants’ claims are based.

104. Except where the context shows otherwise, the facts summarized below are
not disputed by the Parties, although the Parties differ as to their legal significance
and consequences.

B. EU Initiatives and Italian Legislation

105. In 1998, Italy signed the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and committed to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by 8% by the end of 2012.'°

106. On 27 September 2001, the European Parliament and Council enacted
Directive 2001/77/EC, requiring Member States to “take appropriate steps to
encourage greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy
sources....”!” The Directive listed reference values by which the Member States
were supposed to adopt “national indicative targets” for the consumption of

" Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the
promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, Article
3.1, CEX-33, referring to the Kyoto Protocol.

29

renewable energy to be achieved by 2010. The reference values for the European
Community and Italy were 22% and 25%, respectively.'*

107. Italy implemented Directive 2001/77/EC by enacting Legislative Decree No.
387 on 29 December 2003, which provided that specific criteria to promote solar
energy would be set forth in ministerial decrees adopted by the Minister of
Productive Activities in consultation with the Ministry of Environment and
Protection of Natural Resources.'”

108. Legislative Decree No. 387 provided that the criteria established through the
implementing decrees must not impose any new costs on the state budget.”° It
also provided that incentives “[f]or electricity produced by photovoltaic
conversion of solar energy [shall] provide for a specific rate with decreasing
amount and duration, such as to ensure a fair return on the costs of investment and
operation.””! The “decreasing amount” of the incentive rates was related to the
anticipated operational cost reductions as PV technology improved.”

C. The Conto Energia Decrees

109. In 2005, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 387, Italy initiated a system by
which qualified PV facility operators received incentive payments for each unit of
electricity generated, which were paid in addition to the wholesale electricity
prices which those operators received. This was effected through a series of so-
called “Conto Energia” (Energy Account) ministerial decrees. The incentive
tariffs were structured as a premium that accrued in addition to the market prices
received by PV operators, although this framework was somewhat modified under
the fifth Conto Energia decree, discussed below. Each of the Conto Energia
decrees expressly provided that the tariff premiums, once granted, would be paid
for a twenty-year period commencing from the date of a PV plant’s entry into
operation.

110. Since Legislative Decree No. 387 did not allow the costs of incentives to be
borne by the state, those costs were passed on to electricity consumers through
electricity bills. The AEEG (Authority for Electrical Energy and Gas) collected
those fees from consumers to cover the incentive tariff costs. The GSE was the

state-owned company responsible for paying the incentive tariffs to electricity
producers under the Conto Energia decrees.”4

111. The GSE confirmed the right to a specific tariff rate by means of a letter to the
person or company holding the project rights to a PV facility, as well as by a
contract entered into with the person or company. Contracts between the GSE and
the owners of PV facilities became effective on the date when the PV facility
entered into operation.”>

112. The first Conto Energia decree, which applied to eligible PV facilities under 1
MW in capacity, was enacted on 28 July 2005 (as amended in 2006, “Conto I”).
Conto I, prior to its amendment in 2006, set a national target for total PV capacity
of 300 MW, which was raised to 1000 MW in 2006.””

113. Conto I provided for eligible PV facilities to receive fixed incentive premiums
for a twenty-year period. PV facilities receiving authorization under Conto I in
2005 and 2006 received tariff premiums within the ranges below, while those
qualifying after 2006 received slightly lower rates.

e EUR 0.445 per kWh for plants between 1 kW and 20 kW;
e EUR 0.460 per kWh for plants between 20 kW and 50 kW; and
¢ EUR 0.490 per kWh for plants between 50 kW and 1 MW.”

114. Conto I (prior to the 2006 amendment) provided for tariffs to be adjusted
upward for inflation according to the ISTAT (Italian National Statistics Institute)
index.”? The inflation adjustment was revoked in the 2006 amendment to Conto
1, and subsequent Conto Energia decrees did not provide for an ISTAT inflation
adjustment.

115. | Under Conto I, a PV operator seeking to obtain incentive tariffs was required
to submit a formal request. After receiving a provisional authorization, the
developer had to commence and complete construction and connect to the grid
within a certain time limits — no later than twenty-four months from the
authorization to grid connection.*!

116. By the summer of 2006, 387 MW of new PV capacity had been accepted
under Conto I and further applications under Conto I were suspended until March
2007 due to the capacity threshold for 2006 being already met.”

117. | The second Conto Energia decree (“Conto IT’) was enacted on 19 February
2007. Conto II eliminated the preliminary authorization phase that existed under
Conto I and instead provided that PV producers could apply for the incentive
benefits upon entry into operation of their facilities." Conto I provided for an
increased capacity threshold, permitting facilities over 1 MW to apply for
incentive tariffs, and a cumulative installed capacity of 1,200 Mw.*

118. Under Conto II, eligible PV facilities could obtain incentive tariffs at rates that
varied depending upon certain criteria, including the facility’s nominal capacity
and size, and when the facility entered into operation. The rates were lower than
those under Conto I. Facilities entering into operation prior to 31 December 2008
received a slightly higher rate than those which entered into operation between 1
January 2009 and 31 December 2010.*°

119. The period of eligibility for Conto II was extended by the so-called “Salva
Alcoa” decree, which enabled PV plants built by 31 December 2010 and entering
into operation by 30 June 2011 to benefit from the Conto II incentives.*”

Member State for renewable energy production, setting forth a target for Italy of
17% of its gross energy consumption to derive from renewable energy sources by
2020.”

121. The third Conto Energia decree (“Conto III’) was enacted on 6 August
2010.*° Under Conto III, eligible PV facilities entering into operation by 31
December 2011 could obtain tariff premiums ranging from EUR 0.251 per kWh to
EUR 0.362 per kWh, with plants entering into operation in 2012 and 2013
receiving a somewhat reduced rate.*! Qualification of new PV facilities under
Conto III was available until the threshold of 3,000 MW in cumulative installed
capacity was reached, although facilities that entered into operation within
fourteen months of the date when the threshold was reached could also receive the
tariffs.”

122. _ Italy implemented Directive 2009/28/EC by issuing Legislative Decree 28 of 3
March 2011, referred to as the “Romani Decree”.** The Romani Decree
implemented various changes, inter alia, a shorter qualifying period for Conto III
tariffs, requiring eligible plants to enter into operation by 31 May 2011 instead of
31 December 2013, the original cut-off date.** In connection with the modified
qualifying period, the Ministry of Economic Development was to establish revised
incentive tariffs for PV plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, resulting
in the fourth Conto Energia decree.*> The Romani Decree also required that
future incentive tariff decrees take into account cost reductions already achieved
for PV technology and the level of incentives being offered in other EU
countries.

123. The fourth Conto Energia decree (“Conto IV”) was enacted on 5 May 201 147

Conto IV provided that eligible PV plants entering into operation between 31 May
2011 and 31 December 2016 could qualify for incentive tariffs lasting for a
twenty-year period according to rates set forth therein.**

124. Conto IV instituted measures to limit the increasing costs of the incentive
tariff programs, including by setting caps on total program costs for semester,
precluding approval of further PV facilities within a semester once the threshold
had been reached.*” Additionally, Conto IV set a national target of 23,000 MW of
cumulative installed capacity, which was said to correspond to an annual cost for
the incentives of between EUR 6 billion and EUR 7 billion.”

125. The fifth and final Conto Energia decree (“Conto V”) was enacted on 5 July
2012 and entered into force on 27 August 2012.5! The preamble to Conto V
references positive progress toward meeting Italy’s mandatory national target of
17% under Directive 2009/28/EC. Conto V provided that it would cease to
apply thirty days after the AEEG issued a resolution stating that Italy had added
EUR 700 million to the total cost of the incentive tariffs program, amounting to a
total cost of EUR 6.7 billion per year. Thus, as the AEEG issued the resolution
on 6 June 2013, the tariffs provided for under Conto V became unavailable to new
PV facilities after 6 July 2013.°4

126. As mentioned above, Conto V provided for a somewhat altered structure of
tariff incentives, intended to reduce costs to end-consumers. PV plants up to 1
MW could qualify for an “all-inclusive tariff’ consisting of the price of the
electricity, the value of the incentive premium, plus a further specific tariff for
self-consumed energy.” PV plants over 1 MW received a fluctuating amount
based on the difference, if positive, between the “all-inclusive tariff’ and the
“hourly zonal price”.*°

D. Tariff Recognition Letters and GSE Agreements

127. Each PV operator receiving incentives under the Conto Energia framework
first received confirmation of its right to a specific tariff in a letter from the GSE
(“Tariff Recognition Letter”), which expressly stated that the tariff would remain
constant for a twenty-year period. An example of the wording in a Tariff
Recognition Letter under Conto II is as follows:

With reference to the photovoltaic plant named [name of the relevant
plant], we hereby communicate the admission to the incentive tariff
under Ministerial Decree 19 February 2007, equal to 0.3460
euro/kWh. (...) The tariff will be recognized for a twenty year
period(...) the tariff is constant (...) for all the twenty year period.*”

128. Afterward, the operator would enter into a contract with the GSE. These
agreements (“GSE Agreements”) set forth the specific tariff incentive rate that the
PV operator would receive and the specific dates comprising a twenty-year period
during which the incentive would be paid. The relevant contractual wording was
substantively the same in GSE Agreements under Conto I, Conto II, Conto II and
Conto IV, and the present dispute does not concern PV facilities granted
incentives under Conto V. As an example of the relevant wording, one GSE
Agreement under Conto III provided:

The tariff to be granted to the photovoltaic plant [Ferrante] pursuant
to this Agreement is equal to 0.3140 €/kWh and is constant in current
currency”. (...) This Agreement is effective as of 29 April 2011 and
will expire on 28 April 2031.°°

E. Minimum Guaranteed Prices under Off-Take Regime

129. In addition to feed-in tariff premiums under the Conto Energia decrees,
Legislative Decree No. 387 also established an “off-take regime” whereby the
GSE directly purchased electricity from certain smaller renewable energy
producers at minimum guaranteed prices (“MGP. Scheme”).*? The MGP Scheme

was designed to ensure economic survival and minimum remuneration of smaller
facilities, regardless of the trend of market prices, since those facilities were
considered to have higher relative operating costs. Under the MGP Scheme, PV
plants with a capacity below 1 MW received either a certain minimum guaranteed
price or the market wholesale price, whichever was greater. The minimum
guaranteed prices were introduced by AEEG Resolution no. 34 in 2005," which
was replaced by Resolution no. 280 in 2007.°' PV plants eligible for the off-take
regime could also benefit from tariff incentives under the first four Conto Energia

 

decrees.

130. Further, similar to the GSE Agreements under the Conto Energia decrees, PV
producers that participated in the MGP Scheme entered into contracts with the
GSE. Those contracts had a one-year term that was subject to automatic renewal,
with terms and conditions set by the AEEG.

F. The Claimants’ Investments

131. Except where noted otherwise, the account of Claimants’ investments below
has not been contested by Respondent.

1. NovEnergia’s and NIP’s solar investments in Italy

132. In late 2008, NovEnergia and NIP started to develop PV projects in Italy,
encouraged by Italy’s enactment of the Conto Energia decrees, which they viewed
as providing returns that were “attractive, but not excessive” and “stable and
predictable.”

133. | NovEnergia and NIP invested in fifty-two PV projects in Italy during the time
period from 2010 to 2013, which they still held as of 1 January 2015.% Fifty of
those investments were structured as an equity holding in an Italian joint venture
company, Holding Fotovoltaica S.p.A. (“HFV”), incorporated on 6 April 2009.
NIP acquired 49.75% of the shares of HFV. Novenergia Italia S.p.A., a subsidiary
of NovEnergia and NIP, acquired 0.25% of the shares of HFV, meaning that
NovEnergia cumulatively owned 50% of the shares of HFV.™ Two independent

Italian joint venture partners, F2i Energie Rinnovabili S..L® and Tisol S.r.l.,
acquired, respectively, 49.75% and 0.25% of the HFV shares.

134. Each of the PV facilities acquired by HFV was either already receiving
incentive tariffs or was eligible to receive them under the Conto Energia
decrees. Some of those facilities also benefitted from minimum guaranteed
prices under the off-take regime.*” HFV acquired those facilities over the course
of 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.

135. In addition to the fifty PV projects held through HFV, NovEnergia and NIP
invested directly in two PV projects, which were eligible to receive incentives
under Conto IV and minimum guaranteed prices under the off-take regime. In
2010, NIP directly acquired 90% of Solar Barocco S.r.]., an Italian company
owning a 990 kW PV plant, and acquired the remaining 10% later that year. NIP
also developed, through Novenergia Italia S.r.1., the 998.4 kW “La Quercia” PV
plant.

136. Through the various acquisitions and investments mentioned above, at the
time this arbitration commenced, NovEnergia and NIP held a 100% interest in two
PV plants, a 50% interest in twenty-one PV plants, and a 40% interest in twenty-
nine PV plants, all of which benefitted from the Conto Energia regime’s
incentives and some of which received minimum guaranteed prices under the off-
take regime. The total combined capacity of those plants exceeded 90 MW. In
acquiring and developing those fifty-two plants, NovEnergia and NIP invested
more than EUR 175 million.

138. Claimants alleged that, after initiating the present arbitration, NovEnergia and
F2i Energie Rinnovabili S.r.1. carried out a demerger procedure which resulted in
a different ownership structure of the above investments, but preserved
NovEnergia’s right to claim for harm suffered by its investments when the
Request for Arbitration was filed.” Respondent has, however, contested this
account, questioning which assets NovEnergia has ceased to own.” Apparently,
for some companies in which NovEnergia previously held a 50% shareholding, it
no longer has any shareholding, and for other companies, its shareholding has
increased to 100%.”!

2. Greentech’s solar investments in Italy

139. | Greentech acquired investments in the Italian PV sector through its 2011
merger with GWM Renewable Energy I S.A., an entity in the renewable energy
division of a Luxembourg-based financial company, GWM Group. GWM
Renewable Energy I S.A. held Italian PV plant assets through its wholly-owned
Italian subsidiary, GWM Renewable S.p.A. In the merger transaction, GWM
Renewable Energy I S.A. received shares of Greentech stock in exchange for the

entire share capital of GWM Renewable S.p.A., which held a portfolio of seventy-
five Italian PV plants.” Greentech’s acquisition was encouraged by the existence
of the Conto Energia tariffs obtained by PV plants within that portfolio.”*

140. While the bulk of Greentech’s Italian PV plants were acquired through the
2011 merger, Greentech acquired additional Italian PV plants in 2012 and 2013.

141. As aresult of investing more than EUR 131 million in the merger and later
acquisitions, Greentech held 100% ownership in eighty-two PV plants in Italy as
of 1 January 2015, with a combined capacity exceeding 31 MW. Each of
Greentech’s PV plants benefitted from feed-in tariff premiums under one of the
first four Conto Energia decrees. Eighty of Greentech’s PV plants were eligible
for minimum guaranteed prices under the off-take regime.”*

G. The Disputed Measures

1. The Spalma-incentivi Decree

143. | With Conto V reaching its target annual cost of EUR 6.7 billion in July 2013,
Italy took steps to reduce the electricity cost burden on consumers attributable to
the incentive programs. On 23 December 2013, Italy enacted Law Decree No.
145/2013, referred to as the “Destinazione Italia” law decree.” The Destinazione
Italia law decree provided two options for PV plant producers: i) to continue to
receive the Conto Energia incentives at the same rate for the remainder of the
twenty-year period, but to foreclose the possibility of receiving additional
incentives thereafter; or ii) to accept reductions to the Conto Energia incentives,
but to receive them for seven additional years, for a total of twenty-seven years.”°
This constituted Italy’s attempt to re-modulate the incentive mechanisms on a
voluntary basis.

144. On 24 June 2014, Italy enacted Law Decree No. 91/2014, known as the
“Spalma-incentivi Decree”, pursuant to which the tariffs previously granted to PV
facilities over 200 kW according to the five Conto Energia decrees were modified
as from | January 2015.”

a. Changes to Incentive Tariff Amount and Duration

145. Article 26(3) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree provided that producers would
have a choice from among three options for the method of calculating new tariffs
that would apply to PV facilities. Should the PV plant owner not make an election
by 30 November 2014, Option C (described below) would apply.”®

e Under Option A, Italy would pay a new, reduced incentive tariff over twenty-four
years (commencing from the PV plant’s entry into operation), instead of the

original twenty-year term. The level of reduction was based on how many years
remained in the original twenty-year period, according to the following table:”

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Residual incentivizing period | Percentage of reduction of the
(Years) incentive
12 25%

14 22%
15 21%
16 20%
17 19%
18 18%
above 19 17%

 

 

 

For example, if the PV producer at that time had fifteen years remaining under
the applicable Conto Energia decree, then the producer would receive the
incentives for nineteen more years at a rate reduced by 21%

Under Option B, the original twenty-year period would be the same. The tariff
rate would be reduced between 2015 and 2019, then increased in subsequent
years according to percentages established by decree of the Ministry of Economic
Development. The relevant decree was adopted on 17 October 2014.

Under Option C, the twenty-year disbursement period would be maintained, but
the tariff rate would be reduced by a fixed percentage based on a PV plant’s
nominal capacity: a 6% reduction for plants with a nominal capacity between 200
kW and 500 kW; a 7% reduction for plants with a nominal capacity between 500

On 27 October 2014, the GSE published on its website the tables containing the value of the remodulation
coefficients (1-Xi) to be multiplied by the previous incentive amounts (I old):

- for the years 2015-2019 the values range from 68.61% of the original tariff, for PV plants having 11 years
remaining under the original Conto scheme, to 90.30%, for PV plants having 19 years or more remaining
under the original Conto scheme.

- during the last 5 years of the residual contracted incentive period, the tariff values range from 131.39% of
the original tariff, for PV plants having 11 years under the original Conto scheme, to 109.70% of the original
tariff, for PV plants having 19 years or more under the original Conto scheme.

kW and 900 kW; and an 8% reduction for plants with a nominal capacity over
900 kw.*!

b. Changes to Disbursement Mechanism

146. In addition to changing the Conto Energia incentive tariffs, the Spalma-
incentivi Decree altered the way in which they were disbursed. According to
Claimants, before the Spalma-incentivi Decree, incentive tariffs were paid based
on actual electricity generated monthly.* Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr.
Edwards, stated that tariffs for a given month would be paid at the end of the
second month thereafter. For example, the incentive tariff for electricity generated
in January would be paid at the end of March.*?

147. Article 26(2) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree specified that, as from the second
half of 2014, the GSE would pay tariffs in constant monthly installments based
upon 90% of a plant’s estimated yearly average production of electricity. The
balance adjustment payment, based on actual production, would be paid by 30th
June of the following year. Ss

148. According to Respondent, the GSE defined the disbursement methods under
Article 26(2) with approval by the Ministry of Economic Development by Decree
of 16 October 2014." Respondent states that the advance installment was an
estimate based on each PV plant’s production in the prior year, and that where
historical data from the entire prior year was not available, a regional average was
to be used.*°

149. In addition to modifying the amount, duration, and disbursement mechanism
of the incentive tariffs, the Spalma-incentivi Decree repealed and replaced the

2. Modification of Minimum Guaranteed Price Scheme

150. From 2011 until 2013, the MGP Scheme underwent a review and consultation
process, with the AEEG requesting data from electricity producer associations and
from the Politecnico di Milano, which produced a report in July 2013. Italy
modified the MGP Scheme at the end of 2013. On 31 October 2013, the AEEG
issued a consultation document that proposed to define the minimum guaranteed
prices based on the average operating costs of renewable energy facilities, plus
8%. For PV facilities, the minimum guaranteed price would be approximately
EUR 37.8 per MWh produced. Then, on 19 December 2013, the AEEG issued
Resolution No. 618/2013/R/EFR (“Resolution 618”), establishing a minimum
guaranteed price of EUR 38.9 per MWh.”! Resolution 618 also reduced the cap
on eligible electricity generation from 2 million kWh per year to 1.5 million kWh
per year.””

151. On 23 December 2013, under the Destinazione Italia law decree (discussed
above), PV facilities over 100 kWh in capacity that were receiving Conto Energia
tariffs were excluded from the MGP Scheme.” Only plants not exceeding 100
kWh in capacity could still obtain both the minimum prices and the Conto Energia
tariffs.

152. As described above, Conto I, as originally implemented in 2005, included an
inflation adjustment according to the ISTAT index.” The inflation adjustment
was, however, revoked in 2006 pursuant to an amendment to Conto 1
Subsequent Conto Energia decrees did not provide for an inflation adjustment.

153. | The revocation measure was contested by several PV producers in 2006 in the
Regional Administrative Tribunal (“TAR”) of Lombardia, which issued decisions
in three separate, unconsolidated cases. The TAR declared the measure null and
void as violating a general prohibition of retroactive legal acts and general
principles of legal certainty and protection of the legitimate expectations of
citizens.°°

154. The GSE appealed the three TAR decisions in 2007, one of which was
affirmed by the Consiglio di Stato in April 2008.°’ However, when the second
case came before the Consiglio di Stato, it referred the matter to the plenary
session of the court, which held in February 2012 that the cancellation of the
inflation adjustment was valid and had no retroactive effect.°* The third appeal
concluded in 2013 with a result consistent with that of 2012.°°

155. The GSE issued several communications, the significance of which is disputed
by the Parties, during and after the appellate proceedings. In 2009, the GSE
issued a press release, informing the market of its decision not to seek repayment
of the ISTAT adjustments paid until that time.!°? On 26 March 2013, the GSE
issued a press release stating that the Consiglio di Stato had upheld the
cancellation of ISTAT adjustments and stating that the GSE would no longer
provide ISTAT-adjusted tariffs.'°' In March 2015, the GSE announced that it
would claim reimbursement of ISTAT adjustment amounts granted since 2005 by
offsetting past payments against future payment of Conto I tariffs. In 2016, the

GSE notified PV producers of the amounts of overpayments that the GSE planned
to recover.

4. Administrative Fee and Imbalance Costs

156. One feature of Conto V was a new requirement that, starting from 1 January
2013, all PV producers receiving incentive tariffs pursuant to any of the five
Conto Energia decrees pay an annual administrative fee. 12 The administrative fee
— fixed at EUR 0.00005 per kWh — was intended to cover the GSE’s management,
audit, and control costs!

157. Conto V expressly permitted the administrative fee to be collected by means
of an offset, according to a method determined by the GSE.'“ The GSE
implemented its collection by offsetting the administrative fee from the GSE’s
first payment of incentive tariffs to each producer in a given year.!°

158. As noted above, the Spalma-incentivi Decree repealed and replaced the
administrative fee provided for under Article 10(4) of Conto V, basing the new fee
solely on the PV plant’s capacity, instead of its effective output of energy.
According to Claimants, the new fee ranged from EUR 1.20 per kW (for plants.
above 1 MW of capacity) to EUR 2.20 per kW (for plants between 3 and 6 kW of
capacity) and was payable annually by off-setting incentive tariff payments due
under GSE Agreements.'°°

159. An additional requirement coming into effect on 1 January 2013, but not
stemming from the Conto Energia decrees, was the requirement that PV producers
pay imbalance costs, i.e., costs attributable to the failure to make accurate
projections of the amounts of electricity capacity that would be injected into the
electricity grid. Before that date, non-renewable energy producers were required
to project the amount of electricity that they would inject into the grid, pursuant to
AEEG Resolution 111/06 of 9 June 2006 (“Resolution 111”),'°” which enabled
Terna (the Italian grid operator) to balance electricity supply with demand.
Producers deviating from their injection schedules were required to pay imbalance

costs.!°° PV producers were effectively exempt from paying imbalance costs
under Resolution 111.'° Their exemption was ended by Resolution
281/2012/R/EFR of 5 July 2012 (“Resolution 281”).!!°

160. Some renewable energy producers challenged Resolution 281 and Resolution
493 in the Italian administrative court, and first-instance decisions in their favor
were upheld on appeal before the Consiglio di Stato on 9 June 2014.'"' The
Consiglio di Stato determined that the two resolutions were discriminatory
because they failed to differentiate among programmable and non-programmable
energy sources. As a result of that decision, it is undisputed by the Parties that the
GSE reimbursed renewable energy producers which had already paid imbalance
costs under Resolution 281.!2

161. On 23 October 2014, the AEEG issued Resolution 522/2014/R/EEL
(“Resolution 522”), which again imposed imbalance costs on renewable energy
producers. |'3 Although Respondent asserts that Claimants have not stated whether
they paid sums requested under Resolution 522, Claimants assert that renewable
energy producers have been paying these imbalance costs since | January 2015.'4

5. 2015 Italian Constitutional Court Decision regarding “Robin Hood” Tax

162. In 2008, Italy enacted a windfall profits tax, nicknamed the “Robin Hood” tax,
which applied to oil, gas, and other traditional energy companies, excluding PV,
biomass, and wind energy producers from its scope.!!° The corporate income tax

increased from 27.5% to 33%,''® then to 34% in 2009.'!”

163. In August 2011, renewable energy producers were no longer exempt from the
Robin Hood tax. Producers with an annual gross income over EUR 10 million
and taxable income over EUR | million became subject to the tax, and the tax rate
was increased to 38%.''*

164. In June 2013, the scope of the Robin Hood tax was extended to cover
companies with annual gross income of over EUR 3 million and taxable income of
over EUR 300,000.!! As a result, according to Claimants, their PV plants
become subject to the Robin Hood tax,!??

165. On 11 February 2015, the Italian Constitutional Court rendered a decision
concerning the constitutionality of the Robin Hood tax.'! The Parties’ respective
interpretations of the decision differ. Claimants assert that the decision declared
the extension of the Robin Hood tax to PV plants unconstitutional.'”” Respondent
asserts that the decision found the tax to have failed to respect “the principle of
equality in contributive capacity, whereas considering its extension to renewable
energy producers perfectly legitimate”.'*> In any event, the decision was applied
on a going-forward basis (ex nunc), rather than from the date of the extension (ex
tunc), and Italy did not reimburse Claimants for the sums previously collected
under the Robin Hood tax.'*4

tax to PV plants to have been unlawful, their claim is not based on the alleged
unlawfulness of the tax measure.'?° Instead, they argue, they “are only contesting

they assert that the measure violated the “effective means” clause of Article
10(12) ECT.'8

6. Re-classification of PV Plants as Immovable and Movable Property

167. Claimants assert that, since at least 2007, PV plants have been classified by
the Italian Revenue Agency as “movable property”.'?? According to Claimants, in
2013, Italy re-classified most PV plants as immovable property, pursuant to
Circular No. 36/E of 19 December 2013.'*°

168. Claimants contend that the re-classification had several effects on PV plants.
First, it reduced PV plants’ depreciation rate to a maximum of 4% per year,
previously maintained at 9%, which increased PV plant owners’ taxable
income.'*! Also, it entailed that Claimants’ PV plants would pay greater amounts
of IMU charges and TASI charges than they had paid prior to Circular No.

property, providing that, as of 1 January 2016, the value of immovable property
would be calculated without including the value of certain elements of the

B. Respondent’s request for relief

172. Respondent requested that the Tribunal render an Award granting the
following relief:

Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the ECT does not cover intra-EU disputes.
Alternatively, decline jurisdiction over the totality of claims, since i) some of the
attacked measures are exempted under Article 21 ECT, ii) the requirement of
unconditional consent under Article 26 ECT is not satisfied as some other
measures have been challenged in domestic courts, and iii) no amicable solution
has been attempted for some further measures.

Equally, decline jurisdiction as for application of the umbrella clause in the light
of the exclusivity forum choice contained in the GSE Conventions.

Ina further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the Claimants’
alleged interests since these are barred from seeking relief, as: i) they had already
addressed domestic courts for the same matters challenged here, and iii) these
latter did not seek amicable solution for a number of claims.

Suspend these proceedings until the Court of Justice of the European Union
adopts its decision on the ACHMEA case under Article 19 of the SCC 2010
Arbitration Rules.'**

173. In the alternative, should the Tribunal determine that it has jurisdiction and
that the claims are admissible, Respondent requested the following relief:

Declare, on the merits, that the Respondent did not violate Article 10(1) ECT,
first and second sentence, since it did not fail to grant fair and equitable treatment
to the Claimants’ investment.

Equally, declare, on the merits, that the Respondent did not violate Article 10(1)
ECT, fourth sentence, either, since it always adopted reasonable and
nondiscriminatory measures to affect Claimants’ investment.

Finally declare, on the merits, that Article 10(1) ECT, last sentence (the so-called
“umbrella clause”) does not apply in the case at stake, or, alternatively, that the
Respondent did not violate it neither through statutory or regulatory measures,
nor the GSE Conventions.

Consequently, declare that no compensation is due.'”

damages proposed by the Claimants are inappropriate and erroneous. This should
also include factual incorrectness of figures.

Order the Claimants to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian Republic in
connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and
disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal
and the charges for the use of the facilities of the SSC, in accordance with

Vv. The Tribunal’s Analysis
A. Overview

1. Summary of Conclusions

175. _ For the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal concludes that it possesses
jurisdiction under the ECT with respect to all of the Claimants’ claims except for
those concerning Italy’s measures relating to the Robin Hood tax and the
classification of PV facilities as movable or immovable, which fall outside the
scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as they concern “Taxation Measures” under
ECT Article 21.

176. Respondent raised several formal objections, asserting that (i) Claimants have
already initiated action in the Italian courts, (ii) Claimants failed properly to
request amicable settlement prior to initiating this arbitration, and (iii) Claimants
are precluded from having recourse to international arbitration based on the forum
selection clauses in the GSE Agreements. The Tribunal, for reasons discussed
below, rejects these objections.

177. Also, Respondent objected that the substantive investment protections and
investor-state arbitration provisions of the ECT do not apply to disputes involving
an investor having the nationality of an EU Member State against an EU Member
State, referred to as “intra-EU disputes”. For reasons discussed below, the
Tribunal concludes that Respondent’s objections are not well founded. Nor, as
explained below, does the ECJ’s decision in Slovak Republic v. Achmea,'*!
hereinafter referred to as the “Achmea Decision”, have any impact on the
Tribunal’s conclusion. Although the Tribunal in forming its conclusions has
considered all of the Parties’ arguments and grounds as well as those of the EC in
its amicus curiae brief, the Tribunal addresses in this Award only the main
arguments.

178. The Tribunal notes that Respondent and the EC contended that the Tribunal
must either find that it lacks jurisdiction or, alternatively, stay the proceedings
pending the ECJ’s decision in Achmea. The Tribunal was not, however,
persuaded that a stay would be appropriate. Further, since the ECJ issued its
decision in Achmea and the Parties have had opportunities to comment on the
decision’s possible impact on this arbitration, the Respondent’s and the EC’s
respective proposals for a stay are moot and therefore not addressed in this Award.

Chamber), Case C-284/16, CLA-194.

179. | With respect to the merits of the claims remaining within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, the Tribunal concludes as follows:

(a) Regarding the incentive tariff reduction under the Spalma-incentivi Decree, a
majority of the Tribunal (Messrs. Haigh and Park) finds that this measure
undermined Claimants’ legitimate expectations, failed to treat Claimants’
investments transparently and consistently, and thus violated the FET clause. That
majority also finds that the incentive tariff reduction portion of the Decree violated
the impairment clause and breached the obligation set forth in the last sentence of
ECT Article 10(1) (the “umbrella clause”).

(b) Regarding the tariff payment term change under the Spalma-incentivi Decree,
cancellation of the ISTAT inflation adjustment, and imposition of administrative
fees and imbalance costs, the Tribunal finds that these measures did not violate the
FET clause, the impairment clause, or the umbrella clause. Regarding
modification of minimum guaranteed prices, a majority of the Tribunal (Messrs.
Sacerdoti and Park) finds that this measure did not violate the FET clause, the
impairment clause, or the umbrella clause.

180. Set forth below are the law applicable to the dispute and the key treaty
provisions on which the Tribunal relies.

2. Applicable Law

181. Article 22 of the SCC Rules provides that the Tribunal “shall decide the merits
of the dispute on the basis of the law(s) or rules of law agreed upon by the
parties.”

182. As confirmed in the Tribunal’s jurisdictional findings below, the Parties have
consented to submit the present dispute to arbitration under the SCC Rules
pursuant to Article 26(4)(c) of the ECT.

183. Article 26(6) of the ECT provides that “[a] tribunal established under
paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and
applicable rules and principles of international law.”

184. Accordingly, this dispute shall be decided in accordance with the ECT and
such rules and principles of international law as may be applicable. As to whether
“applicable rules and principles of international law” in Article 26(6) ECT should
be interpreted as including EU law, the Tribunal addresses this question in its
jurisdictional analysis below.

53

3. Key Treaty Provisions

185. ECT Article 26 sets forth the dispute resolution clause, providing, in relevant
part, as follows:

(1)Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of
the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the
former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which
either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party
party to the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3)(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party
hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute
to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the
provisions of this Article.

(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give
such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously
submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).

(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that
is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its
policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the
Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its
instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in
accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of
accession in accordance with Article 41.

(c) A Contracting Party listed in Annex IA does not give such
unconditional consent with respect to a dispute arising under the last
sentence of Article 10(1).

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for
resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further
provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

[...]
(c) an arbitral proceeding under the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

54

186. ECT Article 10(1) imposes the following host-state responsibilities with
respect to the standard of treatment of foreign investors.

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of
other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such
Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security
and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded
treatment less favourable than that required by international law,
including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe
any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment
of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.

187. ECT Article 21(1) excludes certain “taxation measures” from the scope of
measures with respect to which rights or obligations are created under the ECT,
providing as follows:

Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the
Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

ECT Article 21(7)(a) provides a definition of “Taxation Measures:

The term “Taxation Measure” includes:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local
authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the
avoidance of double taxation or of any other international
agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is
bound.

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international
agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of
Part III or V of this Treaty,

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from
any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,
where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or
Investment.

B. Jurisdiction
1. Formal Requirements

a. Parties and Nature of Dispute

189. As apreliminary matter, ECT Article 26(1) requires that Respondent is a
Contracting Party to the ECT and that Claimants are qualified “Investors of
another Contracting Party”, i.e., have a nationality different from that of
Respondent.

 

190. | The following matters are uncontested. The Republic of Italy is a Contracting
Party to the ECT, which entered into force for Italy on 16 April 1998,'%?
NovEnergia and NIP are both companies duly established under the laws of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for which the ECT entered into force on 16 April
1998.'3 Greentech is a company duly established under the laws of the Kingdom
of Denmark, for which the ECT entered into force on 16 April 1998,'#4

191. The ECT defines a protected “Investor” as “a company or other organisation
organised in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.”!**

'® Traly signed the ECT on 17 December 1994, ratified it on 5 December 1997, and deposited its instrument of
ratification on 16 December 1997. See excerpt from Energy Charter website, CEX-9. Although Italy notified its
withdrawal from the ECT, which Claimants assert took effect in January 2016 (see Reply, {| 53 n. 5.), such
withdrawal does not affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the present arbitration in light of the ECT’s sunset clause,
providing that the ECT continues to apply for twenty years from the date when such notice takes effect.

3 Luxembourg signed the ECT on 17 December 1994, ratified it on 7 February 1997, and deposited its instrument
of ratification on 27 November 1997. See excerpts from Energy Charter website, CEX-11.

4 Denmark signed the ECT on 17 December 1994, ratified it on 22 August 1997, and deposited its instrument of
ratification on 16 December 1997. See excerpts from Energy Charter website, CEX-10.

“SECT, Art. 1(7)(a)(ii), CEX-1.

56

Accordingly, NovEnergia and NIP are Investors with respect to Luxembourg and
Greentech is an Investor with respect to Denmark.

192. As described above (Part III — Factual Background), Claimants acquired and
developed a number of PV facilities and acquired certain rights in Italy.
Respondent has not contested that Claimants’ investments fall within the meaning
of “Investments” under ECT Article 1(6), including the following, as quoted from
the Statement of Claim.

(i) tangible and intangible property and property rights, including
various photovoltaic facilities; (ii) shares and equity participation in
Italian companies and photovoltaic facilities, as well as debt
obligations with respect to those companies and facilities; (iii) rights
to returns, claims to money, and claims to performance pursuant to
contracts having economic value related to the photovoltaic facilities
and related investments; (iv) rights conferred by law, specifically, the
rights to fixed incentive tariffs conferred through various Conto
Energia decrees and rights to guaranteed minimum prices granted in
Italy’s “off-take” regime; and (v) rights conferred by licenses,
permits, and contracts, including rights to incentive tariffs for
electricity produced by their photovoltaic facilities and guaranteed
minimum prices granted in Italy’s “off-take” regime.'*°

193. ECT Article 26 covers disputes “which concern an alleged breach of an
obligation of [a Contracting Party] under Part III” of the ECT.'*” The present
dispute concerns alleged violations by Italy of obligations under ECT Article
10(1), including the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, the
obligation not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investments, and the
obligation to observe obligations entered into with an Investor or an Investment.

The present dispute thus falls within the subject matter described in ECT Article
26(1).

b. Consent to Arbitration (“fork-in-the-road” objection)
194. Claimants expressed their consent to SCC arbitration under ECT Article

26(4)(c) by filing the Request for Arbitration on 7 July 2015.'8

195. Respondent, however, contends that the conditions for finding it to have
provided “unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international
arbitration” under Article 26(3)(a) are not fulfilled.'*? ECT Article 26(2)-(3)
provides:

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on
which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the
Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:
(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party

party to the dispute;
(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

3

(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting
Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.

(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such
unconditional consent where the Investor has previously
submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).

(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is
listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its
policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the
Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument
of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with
Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in
accordance with Article 41.

196. Respondent, as a Contracting Party “listed in Annex ID”, asserts that
Claimants have “previously submitted the dispute” (Art. 26(3)(b)(i)) “to the courts
or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute” (Art.
26(2)(a)) by filing claims in Italian administrative courts on the same or similar
matters as addressed in this arbitration.'°°

197. Respondent contends that several Italian administrative court actions were
brought by parties, including companies owned by Claimants, regarding the
measures at issue in this arbitration, including the Spalma-incentivi Decree.'*!

ECT, Art. 26(3)(a), CEX-1.
'% Statement of Defense, ff 172-184.
5 Statement of Defense, fff 175-180.

58

According to Respondent, claimants in those actions asserted violations of the
Italian Constitution, the ECHR, the ECT, and certain EU directives.!°
Respondent argues that a proper application of Article 26(3)(b)(i) would “focus on
the real substance of the underlying rights as opposed to the form of the legal
action”.'*> Alternatively, argues Respondent, the “triple-identity test” (identity of
parties, cause of action, and object of the dispute) would here be met, since the
domestic cases were instituted by Claimants’ subsidiaries, the “measures at stake
are exactly the same as in these proceedings”, and the grounds include alleged
violations of ECT Article 10.'™

198. In response, Claimants assert that they have not commenced domestic
litigation in Italy and are not participating in any domestic Italian case.'*° While
Claimants concede that certain companies previously owned by NovEnergia and
NIP did file some of the cases Respondent refers to, Claimants assert that none of
Greentech’s subsidiaries did so.'°°

199. For the reason above, Claimants argue that the Italy cannot satisfy the first
element of the triple-identity test, namely, that the previously filed domestic action
and the subsequent arbitration claim involve the same parties. '*” Also, according
to Claimants, “the vast majority of tribunals have held that the parties to both
disputes must be strictly identical” to satisfy the triple-identity test.'°8

200. Regarding the argument that a possible alignment of interests between the
local companies and Claimants should bar Claimants from seeking relief under the
ECT, Claimants argue that such an alignment of interest is irrelevant and cannot
be presumed to exist.!? Furthermore, Claimants assert, the ECT, unlike NAFTA,
does not require companies in which a claimant holds interests to waive domestic
remedies.'’ Claimants refer to prior investment arbitration awards allegedly
affirming investors’ right to pursue treaty claims despite pending domestic
proceedings by their local subsidiaries. '°!

201. Claimants refers to Italy’s “fork-in-the-road” declaration, stating that where a
domestic claim is pending but not yet decided, the Investor may elect to withdraw
the domestic claim “by procedural or lateral renouncement” and pursue
arbitration.'© Thus, Claimants argue, even if they were parties in the domestic
cases, which they deny, that would not prevent them from pursuing arbitration.

202. As for the contention that the “similarity” of the domestic suits to this
arbitration bars Claimants from pursuing the latter, Claimants make two
arguments. First, it would be “fundamentally unfair” to apply such an analysis,
since Claimants — not party to the domestic lawsuits — cannot comment
meaningfully on their scope and Italy’s description of the facts would need to be
accepted at face value.' Second, this arbitration covers a broader scope of Italian
measures than the domestic suits and concerns application of the ECT and
international law.'“ Although Italy has asserted that the ECT was invoked in the
domestic lawsuits, this occurred in only some of them, and Italy has not
demonstrated that an Italian court can rule on the basis of the ECT or international
law in a case involving domestic parties. '®

203. In its Rejoinder, Respondent first argues that Claimants, while showing
evidence of a demerger, did not prove that this ended their ownership of the
companies in the domestic litigation. Further, since the demerger occurred after
the arbitration commenced, the conditions for Respondent’s unconditional consent

were not fulfilled.'° Second, Respondent argues for a “more flexible
interpretative approach” toward the identity of parties, but even under a stricter
approach, Respondent asserts that the companies in the domestic suits and
NovEnergia “should be considered as the same party”.' Respondent argues that
this follows from the fact that NovEnergia controls those local companies but
would itself lack standing to participate in the administrative cases.' Third,
Respondent argues that it is unfair if a decision by the Italian Constitutional Court,
which “addresses the compatibility of the Spalma-incentivi Decree with both EU
law and the ECHR”, does not bar the parties to the domestic law proceedings from
raising the same claims in this arbitration, asserting that those domestic parties are
“materially” the same as Claimants here.'®

204. Having reviewed the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal has not been persuaded
to adopt a non-literal interpretation of ECT Article 26(3)(b)(i), which provides,
“{t]he Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional
consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under
subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).” The term, “Investor”, is unambiguous. In the context
of Article 26, sub-paragraph (1) of which refers to “[d]isputes between a
Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an
Investment of the latter in the Area of the former”, the Italian subsidiaries of
Claimants in this arbitration cannot be understood to be “Investors” but are,
instead, to be treated as “Investments” which are located “in the Area of” Italy.

205. Given that Respondent has not shown that Claimants have previously
submitted the present dispute to Italian courts or administrative tribunals, there is
no ground to deny, based on a fork-in-the-road argument, that Italy has given its
unconditional consent pursuant to ECT Article 26(3)(a). Accordingly, the
Tribunal rejects Respondent’s objection.

c. Request for Amicable Settlement

206. ECT Article 26(1) provides that disputes falling within its scope “shall, if
possible, be settled amicably” and, under Article 26(2), “[i]f such disputes cannot
be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three
months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable
settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:
... (c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.”

207. On7 November 2014, Greentech sent a letter to Italy notifying it of a dispute
regarding alleged violations of the ECT by Italy and offering to settle the dispute
amicably.'” On 15 December 2014, NovEnergia and NIP sent a letter to Italy
notifying it of a dispute regarding alleged violations of the ECT by Italy and
offering to settle the dispute amicably.'7! Claimants filed the present arbitration
on 7 July 2015. It is not contested that Italy did not respond to Claimants’ letters.

208. Respondent contends that the Request for Arbitration and Statement of Claim
asserted new ECT claims regarding the following measures which, Respondent
contends, must be considered to fall outside the scope of the letters of 7 November
2014 and 15 December 2014:!”

e The GSE’s request in March or April 2015 for reimbursement of inflation-
adjusted amounts of tariff incentives received under Conto 1/2

The GSE’s adoption in May 2015 of technical rules regarding modifications to
PV plants, including an obligation to notify the GSE of certain modifications;

Italian Constitutional Court Decision No. 10 of 11 February 2015 declaring the
Robin Hood tax unconstitutional, with application ex nune;'” and

Rules pursuant to Law No. 208/2015, which from | January 2016 reduced the
portions of PV plants deemed immovable, and the allegedly unfair decision of
Italy not to compensate for prior classification.!”°

209. According to Respondent, Claimants’ assertion that these measures relate to
the “same subject matter” as the dispute submitted in their 2014 letters relies on
such a broad interpretation of subject matter that “anything [that] happened in
Italy after they built their plants would fit into these proceedings....”'”’ For
example, regarding the Italian Constitutional Court Decision on the Robin Hood
tax and the effect of Law No. 208/2015 on classification of PV plants as
immovable property, Respondent asserts that these allegedly “fiscal provisions of

a general nature” do not fall within “the same subject matter as claims against
renewable energy support schemes.”!

210. Claimants, on the other hand, contend that their 2014 letters were broadly
drafted, discussed the dispute in detail, and were submitted to Respondent more
than six months before filing the arbitration.!” According to Claimants, the
measures that Italy objects to on this basis concern the same subject matter as the
dispute submitted.'*? Claimants argue that one must distinguish a “measure” from
a “dispute” and that the requirement is only to submit the “dispute” to the
counterparty rather than to identify every measure.'*!

211. Claimants refer to decisions of several investment arbitration tribunals holding
that the requirement to submit a dispute for amicable settlement prior to
commencing arbitration does not require a complete or detailed notice. '**
Furthermore, according to Claimants, a party may bring additional claims which
relate to the same subject matter.'*? Claimants refer to an ECT case under the
SCC rules, AMTO v. Ukraine, which stated the following in regard to ECT Article
26(2):

A party can request amicable settlement of a dispute without
identifying any ECT claims, and an Investor may have good reason
not to formulate claims at this stage...

[...]

In the subsequent Request for Arbitration the Investor was free to
frame its claim as it wished, provided they related to the same
dispute. ...'**

212. Claimants argue that it would be procedurally inefficient and unfair to halt the
proceedings when they are already at an advanced stage, to require Claimants to
file new notice letters in a separate arbitration, or to suspend these proceedings
pending a renewed notice period. 185 They also contend that Italy suffers no
prejudice from inclusion of these claims, to which Italy had ample time to respond

after receiving notice in Claimants’ submissions.'®° Under the circumstances,
Claimants contend that their position is supported by both arbitral tribunals and by
scholarly writing affirming that a notice or amicable settlement requirement is
generally a “procedural” rather than “jurisdictional” matter, which may be
waived.'*”

213. The Tribunal considers Claimants’ 2014 letters sufficiently detailed and broad
to notify and request amicable settlement of the present dispute pursuant to ECT
Article 26(1)-(2). Each measure objected to by Respondent relates to the same
subject matter as other measures referred to in the letters, namely, Italy’s treatment
of Claimants’ PV investments. The Tribunal’s conclusion is consistent with
decisions by other tribunals, including under the ECT, flatly rejecting a formalistic
approach toward the notice of dispute, which need not be exhaustive. In the
present case, there is no doubt that Claimants gave timely and adequate notice and
requested amicable settlement by their 2014 letters. The objection is therefore
denied.

d. Dispute settlement clauses in GSE Agreements

214. Respondent asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the GSE
Agreements and minimum guaranteed price contracts contain exclusive forum
selection clauses that refer disputes to Italian court.'** The forum selection
clauses provide as follows:

For any dispute arising out of, or in any way related to the
interpretation and/or execution of this Convention and the acts it
refers to, the Parties agree on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court
of Rome.'®”

215. According to Respondent, a contractual forum selection clause prevails over
an investment treaty’s arbitration provision, unless the treaty expressly overrides
the forum selection clause.'° Respondent asserts that the ECT does not expressly
override contractual forum selection clauses but instead expressly accommodates

minimum guaranteed prices contract, Art. 16, REX-24, and Respondent asserts that all contracts contain “[t]he

them, noting that ECT Article 26(2)(b) allows submission of disputes to “any
applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure”.'®! Respondent also
contends that the wording, “subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c)” in Article
26(3) means there is no “unconditional consent” to international arbitration where
such an exclusive forum selection clause exists.'°” Respondent suggests that the
wording of the above forum selection clause is broad enough to cover disputes
under the ECT.'°

216. Respondent asserts that the SGS v. Philippines tribunal considered that
exclusive jurisdiction clauses in contracts prevail over dispute settlement
provisions in investment treaties, because the latter are general provisions that
presumably do not override “specific provisions of particular contracts, freely
negotiated between the parties” and because such treaties are intended to “support
and supplement, not to override or replace the actually negotiated investment
arrangements made between the investor and the host State.”!°4 According to
Respondent, the SGS v. Philippines tribunal’s view was followed by the tribunal
in BIVAC v. Paraguay.'*

217. Further, Respondent quotes from a decision in the Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia
arbitration, regarding the possibility of an investor’s waiver of its right to
arbitration under a treaty and the extent to which an exclusive forum selection
clause might effect a waiver.'*° In this context, Respondent asserts that “we
cannot underestimate that investors, including the Claimants, have indeed
addressed the administrative Court of Rome to have the GSE Conventions and the
relevant regulatory acts annulled because of inconsistency, inter alia, with the
EcT.”""”

218. Claimants offer two main arguments in response to Respondent’s contentions.
First, Claimants state that they themselves are not parties to the GSE Agreements
and, as such, would lack standing to pursue claims under the GSE Agreements in
the courts of Rome.'”* This, according to Claimants, distinguishes the present
case from the SGS v. Philippines and BIVAC v. Paraguay cases, where the
claimants were parties to contracts with the respondent states.'°? Also, Claimants
contend, the forum selection clause in the GSE Agreements cannot be
characterized as a “previously agreed dispute settlement procedure” between
Claimants and Italy under ECT Article 26(2).°

219. Second, Claimants characterize the present arbitration as not relating to claims
for breach of contract, but about alleged violations of obligations under the ECT,
with the GSE Agreements only serving as evidence of the alleged treaty
violations.°! Claimants assert that SGS v. Philippines, BIVAC v. Paraguay, and
the ad hoc committee decision in Vivendi support the position that a forum
selection clause in a contract between the claimant and the host state will not
deprive a tribunal of jurisdiction where the “the fundamental basis of the claim is a
treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is
to be judged....”""

220. The Tribunal begins by noting that Claimants are not party to the GSE
Agreements. Thus, regardless of the wide scope of the forum selection clause in
those agreements which Respondent alleges, Claimants do not appear to have
standing to assert claims for breach of contract in Italian court and Respondent has
not stated otherwise. It is clear also that Claimants are not making a claim for
breach of contract in the present arbitration. Claimants have claimed for
violations of the ECT and international law. Given the foregoing, the issue faced
by the SGS v. Philippines and BIVAC v. Paraguay tribunals, of distinguishing a
contract claim from a treaty claim, does not arise here. The Tribunal thus denies
Respondent’s objection based on the forum selection clauses in the GSE
Agreements and minimum guaranteed price contracts.

221. The Tribunal notes that, as Claimants are not party to the GSE Agreements,
the forum selection clause therein could not constitute an “applicable, previously

agreed dispute settlement procedure” under ECT Article 26(2)(b). Article 26(2)
applies only to the “Investor party to the dispute”. While Claimants are parties to
the present dispute, the Italian companies that executed GSE Agreements are not.
The ability of Italian companies not party to this dispute to sue under the GSE
Agreements does not convert the forum selection clause therein to an “applicable,
previously agreed dispute settlement procedure” with respect to Claimants.

2. Objections under Article 21 of the ECT
a. Non-reimbursement of Robin Hood Tax Payments
(i) Respondent’s Position

222. Regarding the Robin Hood tax’s extension to certain PV plants, Respondent
asserts that it was “unequivocally” a taxation measure, citing the Italian
Constitutional Court’s own statement: “[u]ndisputed is the fiscal nature of the tax,
since the tax on corporate income [TARES] is a direct tax ... constituting a
compulsory levy based on an economically significant parameter, and connected
to the public spending. 2708

223. Respondent also asserts that by claiming that the application of the
Constitutional Court’s decision ex nunc instead of ex tunc was not legitimate,
Claimants are in fact claiming that the tax was wrongfully imposed and Italy
refused to compensate them for those payments.” Respondent asserts that this
would “go back to the evaluation of the substance of the Robin Hood Tax and

become de facto a claim on the taxation measure.””°>

224. Accordingly, argues Respondent, Claimants’ claim is against a “Taxation
Measure” under ECT Article 21, and falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

(ii) Claimants’ Position

225. Claimants draw a distinction between, on one hand, claiming that the Robin
Hood tax’s extension to PV plants was wrongful and, on the other hand, claiming
that the Italian Constitutional Court decision to apply its ruling on a going-forward

basis was wrongful. In Claimants’ own words, they “are only contesting
whether the application of Italy’s court decision on a going-forward basis (ex
nunc) rather than an application that would deem the measure invalid from
inception (ex tunc) was fair and in accordance with the ECT.”*"” Also, at the
hearing, Claimants’ counsel asserted, “our claim is that the court in Italy
fundamentally was unfair and inequitable by declaring a measure unconstitutional
but then saying, ‘We’ll only apply this ruling going forward, and for the two years
you have paid these unconstitutional Robin Hood taxes you won’t get a refund’,
so it’s about the court decision and the court’s handling of the future versus the
past. It’s not about the taxation measure itself.”

(iii) Tribunal Analysis
226. ECT Article 21(1) (first sentence) provides:

Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties.

227. The Tribunal is asked to decide whether the Italian Constitutional Court’s

decision, the meaning of which is itself contested by the Parties, violates the
ECT, noting that Claimants contend that their grievance is that the court itself
applied its decision ex nunc rather than ex tunc. If, however, the Tribunal were to
find that the court’s application of its ruling violated the ECT, the Tribunal would
need to determine whether the damages claimed by Claimants are to be awarded.
The damages sought are the same amounts they have alleged were “wrongfully
collected from them” during the 2013-2015 period." For the Tribunal to award
compensatory damages for the Constitutional Court’s application of its decision ex
nunc, which allegedly wrongfully failed to order reimbursement of taxes
“wrongfully collected”, would appear to “create rights or impose obligations with
respect to Taxation Measures” of Italy. In this instance, the Tribunal does not
consider the distinction between the court’s decision on the Robin Hood tax and

8 Transcript, Day 5, 61:23-62:5 (Fleuriet).

As described supra, Claimants assert that the court’s decision declared the extension of the Robin Hood tax

to PV plants unconstitutional. Respondent asserts that the decision found the tax to have failed to respect “the

principle of equality in contributive capacity, whereas considering its extension to renewable energy producers

perfectly legitimate”.

210 See Statement of Claim, {| 292 (stating that that Italian Constitution Court considered the tax to have been
“wrongfully collected from them”); Expert Report of Richard Edwards, 4 April 2016, {[ 3.17 (Table 3-1),
summarizing “the total annual amount of Robin Hood Tax paid in the period from 2013 to 2015 by the
NovEnergia and Greentech Plants (no amounts were paid prior to 2013)”.

the Robin Hood tax itself to be a meaningful one. Accordingly, the Tribunal
concludes that Claimants’ claims relating to the Robin Hood tax under Article
10(1) and 10(12) of the ECT are outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

b. Re-classification of PV Plants as Immovable and Movable Property

(i) Respondent’s Position

228. Respondent asserts that the re-classification of PV plants from movable to
immovable property was “unequivocally” a taxation measure.”'! Alternatively,
Respondent argues, the re-classification was “ancillary” to a taxation measure by
defining the latter’s scope.”'? Respondent asserts that the subject of Claimants’
grievance is “not the definition of the plants as immovable as such, but the
consequence of that definition, which takes their assets to be subject to
taxation.”?!

229. Therefore, according to Respondent, the re-classification of PV plants as
immovable property was a taxation measure falling outside the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction under ECT Article 21.

(ii) Claimants’ Position

230. Claimants rebut Respondent’s Article 21 objection, arguing that “the only
relevance [Claimants’] claim has to taxes is the fact that immovable property is
subject to certain charges (IMU and TASI) whereas movable property is not.”?!*
Claimants state that they “are not contesting the application of those taxes.”?!°
Thus, they argue, the Tribunal’s exercise of jurisdiction would not “create rights
or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures”.

(iii) | Tribunal Analysis

231. The Parties have not contested that the IMU and TASI charges are Taxation
Measures under ECT Article 21. The issue is whether the Tribunal, if it were to
find that the re-classification of PV plants violated or did not violate the ECT,
would “create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures.”

232. _ If, for example, the Tribunal were to find that the re-classification violated the
ECT, the Tribunal would need to determine whether to award the damages
Claimants are seeking. The damages asserted by Claimants are, as described by
Claimants’ quantum expert, for the additional amounts of IMU and TASI charges
paid in respect of years 2013 to 2015.71

233. In light of the above, whether Claimants’ claim is that a measure changing the
scope of applicability of a Taxation Measure or a Taxation Measure itself violates
Article 10(1) of the ECT, the damages Claimants seek are for the amount they
allegedly overpaid in respect of the Taxation Measure. Thus, awarding damages
for the overpayment would “create rights or impose obligations with respect to
Taxation Measures”. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimants’ claim
regarding re-classification of PV plants as immovable property falls outside the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction pursuant to ECT Article 21.

c. Administrative Fee

(i) Respondent’s Position

234. According to Respondent, “Taxation Measures” under Article 21 are
equivalent to “fiscal measures” (or “tributi”) under Italian law, falling into three
categories: “imposta (tax), tassa (fee) and contributo (contribution)....”7!”
Despite the use of “imposte” in the Italian version of Article 21(7)(a)(i),
Respondent opposes an interpretation that limits “Taxation Measures” to meaning
“imposta” under Italian law, noting that Article 21(7)(a) uses the word “includes”,
which Respondent interprets as introducing a non-exhaustive list2'$ Additionally,
Respondent asserts that a narrow meaning of “imposte” or “misure fiscali” would
create a risk that exceptions to Article 21, e.g., for expropriation claims under
Article 13, are construed too narrowly, thus failing to protect investors.
Respondent thus asserts that Taxation Measures should include a wider range of
measures than those encompassed by “imposte” >?

235. Regarding prior arbitral decisions dealing with the topic of taxation measures

under BITs and the ECT, Respondent interprets their significance differently from
Claimants. Respondent argues, inter alia, that the standard for a “taxation law”
set forth in Murphy v. Ecuador would be satisfied by the administrative fee, as it is
a mandatory levy, imposed for public purposes on a class of persons, and there is

no direct benefit to the taxpayer.” Denying Claimants’ argument that the
administrative fee was intended to cover a specific service, namely, the GSE’s
management, monitoring and verification tasks, rather than to raise general
revenue, Respondent asserts that the fee was imposed on “all operators whose
plants can be subject to auditing and investigation”, regardless of which Conto
Energia decree the operator’s plant might fall under.””!

236. Referring to domestic Italian law, Respondent interprets two decisions by the
Italian Constitutional Court regarding certain charges on public utilities or
services,” According to Respondent, in Decision 335/2008, regarding a tariff for
sewer and water treatment services, the Court found that the measure was not a
fiscal measure, based on a “synallagma” or reciprocity between the amounts paid
and the services provided.” On the other hand, in Decision 238/2009, regarding
a charge for municipal waste services, Respondent asserts that the Court found
that it was a fiscal measure.?** According to Respondent, the Court considered
there to be “no synallagmatic relationship” as the charge was payable based on the
kind of house owned rather than the services received, and the citizen could not
refuse to pay just by declining the service,” Respondent asserts that the
administrative fee meets the standard for a fiscal measure set forth in the court
decisions, since the fee is mandatory, is related to quantities of incentivized
electricity produced, is established annually, and is not related to an identifiable
specific service actually received by the PV producer.”

237. Respondent also argues that since consumers also paid a portion of the GSE’s
costs through “Component A3” of their electricity bills, which Respondent
construes as a fiscal measure, this charge must also be deemed a fiscal measure in
respect of PV producers.”””

238. Finally, in rebuttal of Claimants’ arguments that administrative fees would not
be subject to Italian tax courts or subject to double-taxation treaties, Respondent
argues that this is circular reasoning. If, Respondent asserts, the administrative fee
is found to be a fiscal measure, then it will be subject to the tax court jurisdiction,

and if they are not covered by a treaty, that will be simply because of a matter of a
narrow definition used in the treaty.?**

(ii) Claimants’ Position

239. Claimants construe Article 21 as having a narrower scope, noting that the
official Italian version of the ECT defines Taxation Measures by reference to
“imposte”? Also, when it comes to characterizing the nature of the disputed
measures, Claimants consider that although Italian law is relevant, stating that “the
domestic characterization of a disputed measure may be helpful in ascertaining its
nature”, domestic legal notions are not determinative of the meaning of taxation
measures in a treaty."

240. Claimants next refer to arbitral decisions explaining the general notion of
taxation measures under BITs as well as the ECT, as measures imposed on classes
of persons, having the public purpose of raising general revenue for the State, and
not providing a direct benefit to the taxpayer.?*! Claimants note that one tribunal
looked to the “plain text” of the provision imposing the contested measure and the
constitutional framework in which it was enacted.” The tribunal in the Yukos
arbitration considered that only “bona fide taxation measures” fall within ECT
Article 217°

241. Claimants assert that, under their interpretation of Taxation Measures, the
administrative fee was not such a measure, because it was intended to cover a
specific service — the GSE’s management, monitoring and verification tasks —
rather than to raise general revenue for Italy.?** They assert that the administrative

fee is never referred to as a “tax” (imposte) in the provisions introducing the fee,
but is instead referred to as a contribution (contributo) to the GSE in Conto V, and
as an additional tariff (tariffe) owed to the GSE under Law Decree No. 91/2014.
They also contend that Italian tax authorities had no role in “enacting, imposing,
or collecting” the fee.° Nor, according to Claimants, does the administrative fee
correspond to the definition of “imposte” under Italian law, since that notion also
refers to “contribut[ion] to the general public expenditure” and being “not related

to any specific benefit, service, or activity provided by public institutions”.”*”

242. Asan additional ground asserted by Claimants for their position, they assert
that administrative fees are outside the scope of measures subject to Italian tax
court jurisdiction. This is because, Claimants assert, the fee is intended to cover
the GSE’s service costs and is also subject to VAT.*** Finally, Claimants argue,
double-taxation treaties include a definition of the “imposte” covered by those
treaties but Claimants assert they “are not aware” of any such treaty that includes
administrative fees (or a similar fee) in that definition.”

(iii) Tribunal Analysis

243. The Tribunal has considered the Parties’ respective submissions regarding
Respondent’s Article 21 jurisdictional objection to the administrative fee measure
under Conto V. Taking into account the various considerations raised by the
Parties, the Tribunal finds that the administrative fee does not constitute a
Taxation Measure and affirms its jurisdiction to decide the claims asserted by
Claimants.

244. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal need not determine whether
Respondent’s broad interpretation or Claimants’ narrower interpretation of
Taxation Measures is correct. Characterizing relationships as “synallagmatic” or
“reciprocal” provides a useful way to distinguish a tax from another form of
charge, in the sense that the latter notion (“charge”) implicates a more direct
reciprocity of payment for services. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the
administrative fee was established specifically to cover the GSE’s costs of
managing the incentive programs from which PV producers benefited. This
suggests a degree of reciprocity. The Tribunal also notes that Respondent does
not deny that the GSE paid value added taxes (VAT) on amounts received from
PV producers, and that the fee was not collected for the general revenue of Italy.

Taken together, these factors indicate that the administrative fee is not a Taxation
Measure under the ECT.

d. Imbalance Costs

(i) Respondent’s Position

245. After setting forth its general interpretation of “Taxation Measures” under
Article 21 (summarized above), Respondent proceeds to argue that the imbalance
costs charged to PV producers constituted a Taxation Measure. Respondent first
discusses the measure in relation to what it construes as an “ordinary” notion of
taxation measures, then in relation to Italian law.

246. A taxation measure, under the ordinary notion described by Respondent, “is a
matter related to the imposition of a liability on classes of persons to pay money to
the State for public purposes and without any direct benefit to the taxpayer.”™"”
Respondent asserts that the imbalance costs measure is compatible with this
interpretation, stating that “[i]t is absolutely uncontroversial that fiscal measures

247. Respondent, applying the above notion to imbalance costs, asserts: the
imbalance costs measures were “mandatory, do not correspond to an identifiable
specific service obtained from Terna that would qualify reciprocal obligations, and
are connected to the public spending by linking to the dispatching activities of
Terna and on the guarantee of the security of the system.”

248. Turning to Italian law, Respondent repeats the arguments it made regarding
the GSE’s administrative fee, citing to Italian Constitutional Court decisions."
Respondent asserts that imbalance costs are, like a charge for municipal waste
services, a fiscal measure, since the PV producer may not refuse to pay the
charges simply by not utilizing the services.”* Referring to Terna’s monopoly,
Respondent asserts that the payment of imbalance costs to Terna would be

considered “material tributes” or “factual tributes” under Italian law and hence a
fiscal measure.”“*

(ii) Claimants’ Position

249. Similar to Claimants’ argument regarding the GSE administrative fee,
Claimants argue that the imbalance costs were not intended to increase the State’s
revenues, but instead to place some of the costs of the electricity dispatching
services on PV producers.”“° Next, Claimants assert, Italy’s tax authorities were
not involved in “enacting, imposing, or collecting” the imbalance costs, and Italy
never characterized these costs as a “tax” prior to this arbitration”” Instead, the
AEEG imposed the costs through Resolution 281 and Resolution 522, which
allegedly referred to the imbalance costs as “compensations” but never as
“taxes”.

250. Next, Claimants assert that even if a purely domestic Italian law test were
applied, the imbalance costs would not constitute “taxes” (“imposte’), since these
relate to the specific services that Terna provides.” Claimants argue that an
official definition published on the AEEG’s website characterizes imbalance costs
as “network and dispatching services”, rather than as “taxes”.”*° Furthermore,
since the imbalance costs are, according to Claimants, subject to corporate income
tax and VAT, this implies that they are non-fiscal in nature and would not be
subject to Italian tax court jurisdiction.?*! Finally, just as Claimants argued
regarding administrative fees, double-taxation treaties include a definition of the
“imposte” covered by those treaties. Claimants assert they “are not aware” of any
such treaty that includes imbalance costs (or a similar fee) in that definition.”

(iii) Tribunal Analysis

251. Having considered the Parties’ submissions and arguments, the Tribunal is not
persuaded that imbalance costs payable by PV producers pursuant to AEEG
Resolution 281 and AEEG Resolution 522 constitute a Taxation Measure under
ECT Article 21. The Tribunal thus affirms its jurisdiction to decide the claims
asserted by Claimants.

252. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal notes that the imbalance costs relate
to electricity dispatching services, an identified service, and thus are not allocated
to the State’s general revenue. Further, Respondent did not deny Claimants’
assertion that corporate income taxes and VAT were paid on amounts received
from PV producers, that the AEEG did not categorize imbalance costs under the
category of “taxes” but instead categorized them as “network and dispatching
services”, and that Italy has not otherwise treated imbalance costs as a tax. Taken
together, these factors minimize the significance of Respondent’s assertion that
the mandatory nature of the charges make them similar to charges for municipal
waste services, which themselves might not constitute a Taxation Measure under
the ECT.

3. “Intra-EU” Jurisdictional Objections

a. Respondent’s Position

253. As summarized below, Respondent contends that Article 26 of the ECT does
not apply to disputes initiated by an investor from one EU Member State against a
different EU Member State. Such “intra-EU disputes”, Respondent argues, were
never intended to fall within the scope of Article 26, as the ECT’s language and
context show.”* Alternatively, Respondent argues that even if the ECT originally
applied to intra-EU disputes, that was no longer true after adoption of the Lisbon
Treaty.?* Further, Respondent argues that the nature of the EU legal system and,
in particular, Article 344 of the TFEU preclude intra-EU disputes under the ECT.

(i) Argument based on Contracting Parties’ original intention

254. Respondent’s main argument for an original intention to exclude intra-EU
disputes under the ECT is based on the ECT’s conflicts provision (Article 16) and
on other provisions of the ECT and related documents (e.g., the 1991 European
Energy Charter), which Respondent interprets as showing the establishment of a
“more favourable” regime for EU Member States that is separate from that
available to non-EU parties to the ECT.

255. Respondent refers to ECT Article 16, which provides:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international

253

Statement of Defense, f{] 44-69.
*4 Statement of Defense, {| 80-140.

76

agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of
Part III or V of this Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or
from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that
agreement; and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from
any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,

where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or
255
Investment.

256. According to Respondent, under sub-paragraph (1) of Article 16, the ECT’s
investment protection and investor-state dispute settlement provision will not
derogate from a separate international agreement that is “more favourable” to the
investor.

257. As anext step, Respondent seeks to establish that when the ECT was
concluded, there was an international agreement that was more favourable to EU
investors that prevails over the ECT, and hence over Article 26.

258. Thus, Respondent refers to Article 25 which, in pertinent part, provides:

The provisions of this Treaty shall not be so construed as to oblige a
Contracting Party which is party to an Economic Integration
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “EIA”’) to extend, by means of
most favoured nation treatment, to another Contracting Party which
is not a party to that EIA, any preferential treatment applicable
between the parties to that EIA as a result of their being parties
thereto.”

259. According to Respondent, Article 25 reflects the recognition that EU Member
States need not extend to third states that are ECT Contracting Parties the
“preferential treatment” that EU Member States accord one another. Respondent
concludes that Article 25 shows that such preferential treatment between EU
Member States “prevails” over the ECT, applying the “more favourable” conflict
tule of Article 16.7”

260. Next, invoking the ECT’s context and purpose, Respondent refers to two
documents relating to the ECT — a Decision and a Declaration appended to the
ECT - which refer to conditions whereby investors not party to an “Economic
Integration Agreement” can obtain treatment thereunder. Decision No. 5 relating
to Article 24(4)(a) and Article 25 provides:

An Investment of an Investor referred to in Article 1(7)(a)(ii), of a
Contracting Party which is not party to an EJA or a member of a free-
trade area or a customs union, shall be entitled to treatment accorded
under such EIA, free-trade area or customs union, provided that the
Investment:

(a) has its registered office, central administration or principal place
of business in the Area of a party to that EIA or member of that free-
trade area or customs union; or

(b) in case it only has its registered office in that Area, has an
effective and Continuous link with the economy of one of the parties
to that EIA or member of that free-trade area or customs union.?°*

261. Declaration No. 5 with respect to ECT Article 25 provides:

The European Communities and their Member States recall that, in
accordance with article 58 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community:

a) companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a
Member State and having their registered office, central
administration or principal place of business within the Community
shall, for the right of establishment pursuant to Part Three, Title III,
Chapter 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, be
treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of
Member States; companies or firms which only have their registered
office within the Community must, for this purpose, have an effective
and continuous link with the economy of one of the Member States;

(b) “companies and firms” means companies or firms constituted
under civil or commercial law, including co-operative societies, and
other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those
which are non-profitmaking.

The European Communities and their Member States further recall
that:

Community law provides for the possibility to extend the treatment
described above to branches and agencies of companies or firms not
established in one of the Member States; and that, the application of

258 Decision No. 5 with respect to the Energy Charter Treaty (Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy
Charter Conference), CEX-1.

78

Article 25 of the Energy Charter Treaty will allow only those
derogations necessary to safeguard the preferential treatment
resulting from the wider process of economic integration resulting
from the Treaties establishing the European Communities?”

262. In Respondent’s view, the above Decision and Declaration “cannot but
confirm the intention of the Contracting Parties to cover only situations external to
the EU.” From this, the Respondent asserts that if a non-EU investor became
entitled to the treatment owed among EU investors, then it would obtain the
dispute resolution mechanisms available in the EU and would thereby relinquish
the “double protection” afforded by ECT Article 26.7!

263. As further contextual grounds for its position, Respondent refers to the
preamble to the 1991 European Energy Charter, mentioning the EU’s internal
energy market; ECT Article 2, stating that the ECT is established “in accordance
with the objectives and principles of the Charter”; and certain EU Directives and a
Commission Proposal for a Council Directive pre-dating the ECT’s adoption, as
allegedly demonstrating the intention of the EU and Member States to “regulate
intra-EU situations exclusively within the Internal Market rules” and to establish
their own dispute resolution procedure.? In particular, Article 26 of the
Commission Proposal provided, “Member States shall establish a dispute
resolution procedure by which the parties can settle disputes on matters covered
by this Directive.”°

264. Respondent also asserts in support of its position a general practice of the EU
and its Member States, beginning from the Electrabel case, of objecting to the
jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals in intra-EU disputes brought pursuant to the
EcT.*

265. Asan argument in the alternative, Respondent contends that the 2007 Lisbon
Treaty was a legitimate inter se agreement among the EU Member States that
modified their rights and obligations and removed intra-EU disputes from the
scope of ECT Article 26,765

266. To establish the legitimacy of the alleged inter se agreement modifying the
ECT, Respondent contends that the Lisbon Treaty is a “successive treat[y] relating
to the same subject-matter” as the ECT, falling within Article 30 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), and that this inter se modification
complies with VCLT Article 41.2%

267. Respondent asserts that the ECT and Lisbon Treaty relate to the same subject
matter because they “factually cover the same situation of an investor entering a
foreign market in the hope of not being unduly discriminated or frustrated in its
investment, as well as being duly protected by fair judicial or quasi-judicial
mechanisms against misuse of power.””*” Next, Respondent provides two
alternative interpretations of VCLT Article 30, both of which allegedly result in
EU law prevailing over provisions of the ECT.

268. First, Respondent refers to VCLT Article 30(2), providing, “[wJhen a treaty
specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with,
an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.”*°° Respondent
asserts that ECT Article 16 falls directly within VCLT Article 30(2), as Article 16
“specifies that [the ECT] is subject to” a treaty “more favourable” than it with
regard to provisions under ECT Parts III and V. The Lisbon Treaty, Respondent
argues, provides “a more developed and articulated legal system” whose
“protection of EU nationals against the acts of a Member State ... cannot even be
compared to” the ECT’s level of protection.” Further, according to Respondent,
EU law protects “legitimate expectations” and is “much more advanced” than the
ECT with respect to investment law.” Therefore, Respondent argues, the ECT’s
investor-state arbitration provisions are prevailed over by dispute resolution
systems available under EU law.

269. Second, alternatively, Respondent asserts that the application of VCLT Article
30(4) produces the same result. As Respondent argues, Article 30(4) refers to
situations where “the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the
earlier one.” This would apply to the ECT and Lisbon Treaty because,
Respondent argues, the parties to the Lisbon Treaty do not include all of the ECT
parties (namely, the non-EU parties). Article 30(4)(a) then refers back to Article
30(3), so that, with regard to EU Member States, “the earlier treaty [namely, the
ECT] applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the
later treaty [namely, the Lisbon Treaty].”?”'

270. Inconnection with lack of compatibility between the ECT and the Lisbon
Treaty, Respondent asserts that, upon the Lisbon Treaty’s adoption, the previously
shared competence among the EU and its Member States with respect to foreign
direct investment (“FDI”) was modified, allocating to the EU exclusive
competence to conclude agreements with third parties on FDI issues.?”?

271. Finally, VCLT Article 30(5) states that it is “without prejudice to article 41”,
which describes conditions for inter se modification of multilateral treaties.
Respondent argues that the Lisbon treaty was a “perfectly legitimate” modification
of the ECT as between EU Member States,””* which complied with sub-paragraph
(b) of VCLT Article 41(1), providing in relevant part,

1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an
agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

[...]

(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:
(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights
under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;

(ii) Does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is

incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose
of the treaty as a whole.

272. With respect to sub-paragraph (b)(i), Respondent argues that the Lisbon
Treaty did not affect non-EU Contracting Parties, which retained their rights under
ECT Article 26.7" As for sub-paragraph (b)(ii), Respondent asserts that the
modifications did not relate to an ECT provision “derogation from which is
incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose” of the ECT

as a whole, because non-EU Contracting Parties retained their rights under Article
262° Respondent asserts, “[o]utside the Union, the ECT is fully applicable, and
investors of non-EU Contracting Parties have no obstacle to claim the application
of the ECT through article 26 ECT.”?”

(iii) | Respondent’s further intra-EU dispute objections

273. In further support of its intra-EU jurisdiction objection, Respondent also
makes the following comments.

274. First, seeking to buttress its argument that EU law provides a “more
favourable” regime than the ECT, Respondent asserts that EU law protects “the
whole investment life cycle” for EU investors, based on laws regarding the
freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.?”” Tn this connection,
Respondent mentions that EU investors may take legal recourse against Member
States in the courts and obtain preliminary rulings from the ECJ under Article 267
TFEU, thus ensuring the consistent application of EU law.” According to
Respondent, litigation in the EU courts provides “access to justice” and

“predictability and rule of law’.?”

275. Next, Respondent asserts that application of the ECT to intra-EU dispute
“supports discrimination”, stating as follows:

It is undeniable that giving only to some EU investors the right to
have recourse to an arbitration mechanism against an EU Member
State as an additional opportunity to recourse to national courts
would seriously jeopardize such principle. However, if we apply
international agreements like the ECT also to intra-EU disputes we
do support discrimination.

efficient and protective solution for investors in a situation where local courts would easily discriminate the foreign
investor or permit the State to escape its liabilities” but asserts that “[w]ithin the EU, this need for special protection
does not have the same urgency. On the opposite, because of the EU, citizens can now benefit of similar protection
all around Europe.”)

**° Statement of Defense, | 79.

276. Furthermore, anticipating arguments made more thoroughly by the European
Commission in its Amicus Curiae submission, Respondent briefly argues that
TFEU Article 344 prohibits Member States from submitting a dispute concerning
interpretation or application of the EU treaties to any dispute settlement method
not provided for in those treaties.”*! Respondent considers that an arbitral tribunal
is not a “court or tribunal of a Member State” under TFEU Article 267 and thus
cannot refer questions to the ECJ.®? Since, in Respondent’s view, the ECT is part
of EU law, it is inconsistent with Article 344 for an EU investor to seek relief
from an arbitral tribunal, but an EU investor may instead petition an Italian court
for possible relief under the EcT.*?

277. Finally, Respondent, seeking to rebut Claimants’ contention that “unanimous
case law confirms the ECT’s application to intra-EU disputes”, argues that the
arbitral awards cited by Claimants are insufficient to prove Claimants’ contention,
considering that other cases involving similar issues are still pending and none of
the cases decided thus far has addressed all of the same legal issues involved in
this arbitration.“

b. The European Commission’s Amicus Curiae Brief

278. The EC’s argument, in outline, is that the ECT created no obligations among
EU Member States. Alternatively, if the ECT did create certain obligations among
them, those did not include any investment protection or investor-state dispute
settlement obligations contained in ECT Part III and Article 26. Finally, if ECT
Article 26 were applicable between EU investors and EU Member States, this
would conflict with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),
requiring resolution in the TFEU’s favor by means of “harmonious interpretation”
or applicable rules on conflict of laws.?*°

(i) Arguments against intra-EU obligations under the ECT

279. The EC’s first set of arguments contend that the ECT’s text, in its ordinary
meaning pursuant to VCLT Article 31, implies that EU Member States never
offered to arbitrate with EU investors.”*° The EC asserts that the ECT’s
definitions, voting provision, and a declaration of the EU pursuant to ECT Article

26(3)(b)(ii) (its “fork-in-the-road” declaration) demonstrate an understanding by
the Contracting Parties that the EU Member States had transferred certain
“competences” to the EU, pursuant to treaties establishing the EU.”*’ From these
texts, the EC concludes that EU investors are barred from arbitrating against
Member States under the ECT.

280. The EC’s review of definitions begins with the term “Regional Economic
Integration Organization” (“REIO”), defined at ECT Article 1(3) as an
organization to which states have “transferred competence over certain matters a
number of which are governed by [the ECT]”, and used in other definitions
(namely, “Contracting Party” and “Area”).”** The term “Contracting Party”,
defined at ECT Article 1(2), may refer to either a state or an REIO for which the
ECT is in force. Pursuant to ECT Article 1(10), “Area” may refer to the territory
of a state that is a Contracting Party, or to an REIO, whose “Area” comprises the
“Areas of the member states of such Organisation, . . .” Noting that the definition
of “Area” refers to “provisions contained in the agreement establishing that
Organization”, the EC concludes that the ECT recognizes that relationships among
the EU Member States parties to the ECT are governed by EU treaties. 28° ‘The EC
asserts that, according to its interpretation of “Area”, an EU investor’s investments
in Italy would not be an “investment in the area of another Contracting Party, but
in the area of the same Contracting Party”, because all EU investors are located in
the same “Area”.”*°

 

281. Next, the EC observes that ECT Article 36(7) provides that the REIO, when it
votes, has the number of votes equal to the number of member states that are
Contracting Parties, but that the REIO and Member States will not vote together
on the same matters. The EC suggests that this, together with the definition of
REIO, means that the EU and Member States may each vote on matters falling
within their respective competences.”

282. Additionally, the statement from the EU submitted pursuant to ECT Article
26(3)(b)(ii) provides that the Communities and Member States will, when
necessary, determine which of them is the respondent in “arbitration proceedings
initiated by an Investor of another Contracting Party.” The EC asserts that the

words “another” here implies that no arbitration could be initiated against the EU
or the Member States by an EU investor?

283. The EC’s second line of reasoning invokes the ECT’s context, object, and
purpose to support its contention that the ECT did not create inter se obligations
between the Member States, asserting that the EU had a central role in negotiating
the ECT, and that the Charter of Paris and the European Energy Charter,
mentioned in the preamble to the ECT, “refer to the special role and status of the
Union”.2* The EC suggests that, when the ECT was negotiated, the EU and
Member States “acted throughout the negotiations like one single block and with
one voice (that of the Commission).”””> The EC cites scholarly writing to argue
that this “single block” approach is similar to how the EU and Member States
negotiated the WTO agreement, and reflects “the objective of the Community
negotiators to create rights and obligations only between the Community and its
Member States on the one hand and one or more third states on the other.””°°

284. Further, the EC notes that, as a backdrop to the ECT’s adoption, the 1990
summit leading to the Charter of Paris for a New Europe and the 1991 European
Energy Charter, mentioned in the ECT’s preamble, expressed a policy of unity and
the goal of completing the EU’s internal energy market.’ The EC takes the
position that the EU’s objective in concluding the ECT was to “create an
international framework for cooperation in the energy sector between the
European Communities, on the one hand, and Russia, the CIS and the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe, on the other hand” and not to “influence [the EU’s]
internal energy policy.””*

285. From the above context, object, and purpose, the EC concludes that the ECT’s
Contracting Parties “understood ... that — although in theory a possibility — the EU
Member States did not intend to create inter se obligations between them.”?””

286. As an additional ground for denying the existence of intra-EU obligations
under the ECT, the EC contends that a “disconnection clause” is not required in
order to exclude obligations among EU Member States that are parties to a
multilateral treaty.* 0 According to the EC, arbitral tribunals that have confirmed
jurisdiction over intra-EU ECT claims in light of the absence of a disconnection
clause have relied upon Professor Christian Tietje’s views, which the EC contends
are not supported by other scholars or by treaty practice"! The EC contends that,
in the context of multilateral treaties to which the EU and Member States are
parties, a disconnection clause is only required where the application of EU law
instead of the multilateral treaty would be inconsistent with Article 41(1)(b) of the
VCLT.*% The EC concludes that a disconnection clause is not required in the
ECT to comply with Article 41(1)(b), and also asserts that disconnection clauses
have generally been used in international treaties where the EU could not become
a contracting party.*°

(ii) | Argument against intra-EU application of ECT Parts III and V

287. In the alternative, the EC argues that even if the Member States had entered
into certain inter se obligations under the ECT, those obligations would only cover
areas for which they retained external competence, and would exclude the ECT’s
investment protection and investor-state dispute settlement provisions.**

288. — First, the EC advances a principle of international law, expressed as “liability
follows competence”, whereby international obligations and liability among an
international organization and its member states are allocated according to special
tules of the organization itself and not necessarily shared between the organization
and its member states.” This principle, asserts the EC, has been recognized in
the International Law Commission’s 2011 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of
International Organizations (“DARIO”), WTO panel reports, and a decision of the
International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.*° The EC asserts that the principle
applies to the EU and the Member States.*”

289. Next, the EC asserts that the EU possesses “exclusive external competence to
conclude agreements with one or more third countries or international

organisations” regarding foreign direct investment and areas affecting or altering
the scope of common internal EU rules.?°° Further, the EC asserts that a
comprehensive body of EU legislation covers the internal energy market, ensuring
freedom of establishment and free movement of capital, backed by a complete
system of national courts and judicial remedies.*” Thus, according to the EC, for
Member States to conclude an investment protection treaty creating obligations
among themselves “might affect common rules or alter their scope” and thus
interfere with the EU’s exclusive competence under TFEU Article 3(2)3"° The
Member States’ “shared competence” with the EU under TFEU Article 2(2) only
applies within a Member State’s territory, according to the EC.*"' Therefore, the
EC concludes, in light of the ECJ’s decision in Pringle, Member States are
prohibited from concluding an agreement that provides for substantive investor
protections or investor-state arbitration.”

290. The EC concludes that since ECT Part III and Article 26 are within the EU’s
external competence, the EU — but not the Member States — is bound by those
provisions under international law. 313

(iii) | Argument that EU law prevails over conflicting ECT provisions

291. The EC argues that both the substantive and investor-state arbitration
provisions of the ECT would, if applied among EU Member States, conflict with
EU law. According to the EC, the EU reaffirmed its position that TFEU Articles
267 and 344 conflict with such an interpretation when it signed the International
Energy Charter in 2015, attaching a Declaration by the EU.*"* The EU’s
Declaration provides:

It is declared that, due to the nature of the EU internal legal order, the
text in Title II, Heading 4, of the International Energy Charter on
dispute settlement mechanisms cannot be construed so as to mean
that any such mechanisms would become applicable in relations
between the European Union and its Member States, or between the
said Member States, on the basis of that text!

294.

Regarding investment protection provisions, the EC asserts that there is “a risk
of conflict on substance” between the ECT and EU law. This is because,
according to the EC, if the Member States had entered into obligations inter se
when they concluded the ECT, this would conflict with the EU’s exclusive
competence under TFEU Article 3(2).316

With respect to dispute settlement, the EC asserts that the ECT’s provisions on
investor-state arbitration also conflict with the TFEU, drawing attention to the
below provisions:

ECT Article 26(6): an arbitral tribunal shall render a decision “in
accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of
international law.”

ECT Article 26(8): a decision rendered by the tribunal “shall be final
and binding upon the parties to the dispute.”

TFEU Article 344: “Member States undertake not to submit a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any
method of settlement other than those provided for therein.”

TFEU Article 267: the ECJ has jurisdiction to make preliminary
rulings on issues concerning “the interpretation of the Treaties” and
“a court or tribunal of a Member State” may or must refer such issues
to the ECJ.

The EC construes “applicable rules and principles of international law” in
ECT Article 26(6) as incorporating EU law, but asserts that an arbitral tribunal
does not constitute “a court or tribunal of a Member State” under TFEU Article
267 and thus may not refer issues to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling.
Additionally, Article 344 TFEU encompasses, according to the EC, not only
disputes between Member States and EU institutions, but also investor-state
disputes.*!” Therefore, the EC concludes, an arbitral tribunal constituted under the
ECT to decide an intra-EU dispute would issue final and binding decisions on
matters of EU law without having the ability to refer questions of EU law to the
ECJ for a preliminary ruling. The EC asserts that this would,

violate Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, because that new dispute
settlement system is outside the complete system created by those

Amicus Brief, {ff 96-97.
Amicus Brief, 113-115.

88

articles, and, in particular, does not have the possibility or the
obligation to refer preliminary questions to the ECJ pursuant to
Article 267 TFEU.*"*

295. According to the EC, the possibility of court annulment proceedings at the
arbitral seat is insufficient to avoid the alleged conflict between the ECT and the
TFEU, because the reliance upon an annulment mechanism “transposes case-law
from the field of commercial arbitration to the field of investment arbitration”.*!”
The EC contends that commercial and investment arbitration differ in three ways:
first, states are constrained when legislating in the public international law sphere
and “may not limit the scope of application of Article 267 TFEU”, whereas private
parties enjoy contractual autonomy;*”” second, investment arbitration concerns the
behavior of a State acting as a public authority, not contractual rights;*7! and third,
investment treaty tribunals may determine that the seat of the arbitration is outside
the EU, thus circumventing the supervisory authority of a juge d’appui to refer
questions to the EcJ3”

296. In light of the alleged conflict between the ECT and the EU treaties described
above, the EC asserts that the Tribunal is required to resolve the conflict by
applying either TFEU Article 351 or both Article 41(1)(b) and Article 30(4)(a) of
the VCLT.*? Under either alternative, according to the EC, EU law prevails.

297. According to the EC, TFEU Article 351 renders ECT Part III and Article 26
inapplicable as among EU Member States. TFEU Article 351 provides:

The rights and obligation arising from agreements concluded before 1
January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their
accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and
one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the
provisions of this Treaty.

To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with this
Treaty, the Member State or States concerned shall take all
appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established.
Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end
and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude.

In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member
States shall take into account the fact that the advantages accorded
under this Treaty by each Member State form an integral part of the
establishment of the Community and are thereby inseparably linked
with the creation of common institutions, the conferring of powers
upon them and the granting of the same advantages by all the other
Member States.

According to the EC, since TFEU Article 351, first paragraph, expresses a
“pacta sunt servanda guarantee” that prior agreements between Member States
and third states shall not be affected by the TFEU’s provisions but does not
express such a guarantee with respect to prior agreements among Member States
themselves, this implies by “a contrario reasoning” that prior agreements among
Member States are superseded by the TFEU in case of any inconsistency.*” The
EC cites ECJ case-law in support of this position with respect to certain
multilateral treaties other than the ECT.*”° The EC concludes that if TFEU Article
351 is applied as a conflict rule, Part III and Article 26 of the ECT would become
inapplicable between EU Member States.*?”

299. As an alternative argument, the EC contends that if VCLT Articles 41(1)(b)

and 30(4)(a) were applied to resolve a conflict between the ECT and EU law, Part
Il and Article 26 of the ECT would also be superseded.” The EC (similar to
Respondent) asserts that the conditions of VCLT Article 41(1)(b) would be met
even if ECT Part III and Article 26 were rendered inapplicable as between EU
Member States, as this would not affect the enjoyment of those provisions by non-
EU Member States. Furthermore, asserts the EC, the “effective execution of the
object and purpose of the [ECT] as a whole” would not be affected, since non-EU
Member States would still be able to bring investor-state arbitrations.*”?

300. VCLT Article 30 governs the application of successive treaties relating to the

same subject matter. According to the EC, VCLT Article 30(4)(a) applies to the
ECT (as an earlier treaty) and the EU Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon
(the later treaties), and since the parties to the latter treaties do not include all the
parties to the earlier one, then, “as between States Parties to both treaties the same

rule applies as in paragraph 3.” Therefore, VCLT Article 30(3) is to be applied
as between the EU Member States, with the result that “the earlier treaty applies
only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later
treaty.”*! Thus, asserts the EC, the ECT applies only where its provisions are
compatible with the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon.>*” Applying the
EC’s earlier reasoning about inconsistency between EU law and intra-EU
investor-state arbitration under the ECT, the EC concludes that Part III and Article
26 of the ECT are not applicable.

c. Claimants’ Position

(i) Arguments in response to Respondent’s objections

301. Claimants counter the Respondent’s “intra-~-EU” jurisdictional objections with
arguments based on (i) the ECT’s explicit terms, (ii) a line of consistent arbitral
decisions, and (iii) the rules of treaty interpretation.*?

302. Regarding the ECT’s explicit terms, Claimants assert that EU investors are
authorized to bring claims in international arbitration against EU Contracting
Parties, as Article 26 provides for dispute settlement “between a Contracting Party
and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter
in an Area of the former.”*** Claimants argue that this is clear from the lack of
any exception in the ECT for certain Contracting Parties, noting that Italy,
Denmark and Luxembourg are all Contracting Parties, and none made any
exception to the applicability of Article 26 upon ratification. Claimants also note
that ECT Article 46 precludes reservations, providing, “[n]o reservations may be
made to this Treaty.”**

303. Claimants also note the absence of any express or implied “disconnection
clause” in the ECT, arguing that the EU and the Member States, during
negotiations for the ECT in which the EC itself played a key role, could have
sought to include a disconnection clause but chose not to do so. Claimants
assert that disconnection clauses have been included in other treaties to make

certain provisions inapplicable as between EU Member States.**” Claimants also
cite scholarly writing to reinforce its view that no form of disconnection clause is
present in the Ect

304. Claimants next challenge Respondent’s application of ECT Article 16 which,
according to Respondent, implies that the EU treaties prevail over allegedly
incompatible provisions of the ECT because the EU treaties are “more favourable”
to EU investors. Claimants dispute the latter assumption, arguing that, since EU
law does not provide that EU investors may refer disputes against Member States
to international arbitration whereas the ECT does so provide, the ECT contains
more favourable provisions.*” According to Claimants, “Article 16 cannot be
used to deny a benefit that the ECT affords to investors.”*"°

305. In response to Respondent’s construal of ECT Article 25 as recognizing a
preferential treatment among EU Member States that need not be extended to non-
EU investors by virtue of most favoured nation treatment and “prevails” over the
ECT, Claimants counter that Article 25 is silent about the standards of treatment
and dispute resolution mechanisms available in an intra-EU context.*4!

306. Further, regarding the Declaration pertaining to Article 25 whereby Member
States may extend favorable treatment under EU law to “branches and agencies of
companies or firms not established in one of the Member States”, Claimants assert
that the Declaration, like Article 25 itself, lacks relevance to whether the ECT is
applicable to intra-EU disputes.*””

307. Claimants conclude their rebuttal to Respondent’s textual and contextual
arguments by referring to the documents and instruments executed temporally
near the ECT’s conclusion.

308. According to Claimants, Decision No. 5 pertaining to Article 24(4)(a) and 25,
appended to the ECT, merely states that EU Contracting Parties must afford non-
EU investments with business activities within the EU the same treatment as
investments of EU investors“? Claimant concludes that Decision No. 5 does not
prohibit EU investors in any way from having recourse to arbitration against an
EU Member State.*“*

309. Regarding the European Energy Charter and ECT Article 2, both raised by
Respondent, Claimants argue that these “do not create a distinction between the
European internal market and the adoption of the ECT” and cannot be understood
to establish a “regime” different from the ECT. Additionally, Claimants argue
that the dispute resolution mechanism mentioned in the Commission Proposal for
a Council Directive, adopted by Directive 96/92/EC, was not intended to resolve
intra-EU disputes regarding foreign investment, but instead was aimed at disputes
“relating to the contracts, negotiations, and refusal of access or refusal to
purchase.”**

310. As Claimants’ second line of argument, Claimants refer to several ECT
awards that have expressly denied any exception for intra-EU disputes to
arbitration under Article 26, denied the existence of any disconnection clause in
the ECT, and rejected the notion that the TFEU and the ECT are incompatible.“°
According to Claimants, two of those awards have not been made public.”
Further, Claimants refer to several awards under bilateral investment treaties
(BITs) that have also rejected intra-EU objections of the sort raised by Respondent
and the EC.*“*

311. As their third line of argument vis-a-vis Respondent’s intra-EU jurisdictional
objection, Claimants rebut Respondent’s secondary argument, that the ECT
became inapplicable to intra-EU disputes upon the Lisbon Treaty’s adoption.
Claimants argue that, contrary to Respondent’s view, Article 30 of the Vienna
Convention is not applicable, and even if it were, the supposed modification of the
ECT would violate Article 41 of the VCLT. Additionally, Claimants interpret
ECT Article 16 so that the Lisbon Treaty’s adoption does not render the ECT
inapplicable in intra-EU disputes.

312. Claimants argue that the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty cannot be validly
construed under Article 30 of the VCLT so as to limit certain ECT provisions.
First, Claimants contend that Article 30, which determines “the rights and
obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-
matter”, does not apply to the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty, since the two treaties
address different subject matters.” Claimants base their contention on scholarly
writing and on ECT and BIT awards in an intra-EU context, asserting that the
right to commence international arbitration under a treaty is not the same as the
right to bring litigation before a national court or the European Court of Justice.*°°

313. Next, according to Claimants, even if the ECT and Lisbon Treaty did relate to
the “same subject-matter”, their provisions are not incompatible.**! Claimants
quote extensively from BIT and ECT awards denying that the arbitration of intra-
EU disputes is inconsistent with EU law. Claimants cite Electrabel for the
proposition that an arbitral tribunal’s application of EU law does not infringe the
ECJ’s interpretative “monopoly” over EU law.**? Claimants also view the
substantive and procedural rights available under BITs and the ECT as merely
exceeding — but not conflicting with — the rights available under EU and national

law? Additionally, Claimants assert that arbitration does not conflict with the
principle of mutual trust between EU countries.*** Thus, Article 30(3) of the
Vienna Convention, providing that “the earlier treaty applies only to the extent
that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty”, could not apply to
the relationship between the ECT and the later-concluded Lisbon Treaty.*°°

314. Claimants also argue that Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, setting
conditions for a valid inter se agreement to modify a multilateral treaty by two or
more parties thereto, would preclude any “de-activation” of the ECT as between
EU Member States through the Lisbon Treaty. Claimants assert that an
interpretation of the Lisbon Treaty that eliminated EU investors’ right of recourse
to international arbitration “would be incompatible with the object and purpose of
the ECT, which is to promote foreign energy investments by ensuring investors’
rights to arbitration.”**”

315. In response to Respondent’s argument that the Lisbon Treaty prevails over the
ECT in accordance with ECT Article 16, Claimants argue that Respondent have
failed specifically to demonstrate that the Lisbon Treaty “offers more favorable
provisions than the right of investor to access arbitration (Part V of the ECT) and
the substantive protections afforded investments in Part III of the ECT.”*°*
Claimants assert that the right to international arbitration is “fundamental to the
ECT”, citing arbitral case law and scholarly writing, and remark that Respondent
has not referred to any provision of the Lisbon Treaty that is more favorable to
investors than ECT Article 26.*°°

316. According to Claimants, the EC’s contention that the ECT has not created
obligations between EU Member States is contradicted by the ECT’s explicit text
and travaux préparatoires°° Claimants refer, in the first instance, to ECT Article
26, observing that it contains no restriction on investors from certain Contracting
Parties pursuing arbitration against a Contracting Party.*°!

317. Next, Claimants contest the EC’s assertion that a “disconnection clause” can
be inferred from the ECT’s provisions and related instruments, including the
definitions of “REIO” and “Area” (ECT Articles 1(3) and 1(10)), a voting
provision for REIOs (ECT Article 36(7)), and a fork-in-the-road declaration by the
EU pursuant to ECT Article 26(3)(b)(ii).**” Claimants state that although the
ECT’s defined terms acknowledge that certain Contracting Parties belong to
regional organizations, a disconnection clause cannot thereby be inferred.>®

318. Regarding Article 36(7), which provides that an REIO “shall not exercise its
right to vote if its member states exercise theirs, and vice versa”, Claimants argue
that this should be interpreted as preserving EU Member States’ autonomy in
exercising rights as ECT Contracting Parties, not as placing them in a subordinate
position vis-a-vis the EU.*** In this vein, ECT Article 44(3) explains that
ratification of the ECT by the EU as an REIO will not be counted in addition to
those deposited by the REIO’s member states.*”

319. Regarding the EU’s fork-in-the-road declaration under ECT Article
26(3)(b)(ii), relating to the determination of the proper respondent, Claimants
deny that it addresses “who can and cannot bring arbitration claims.”* The
relevant paragraph provides:

The Communities and the Member States will, if necessary,
determine among them who is the respondent party to arbitration
proceedings initiated by an investor of another Contracting Party. In
such cases, upon request of the investor, the Communities and the
Member States concerned will make such determination within a
period of 30 days. (This is without prejudice to the right of the

320. Claimants construe the words “another Contracting Party” in the first sentence
as having the same meaning as it has in ECT Article 26(1), which may refer to
either EU Member States or non-EU Member States that are ECT Contracting
Parties.*°

321. Claimants then turn to the ECT’s historical context and original policy
objectives as described by the EC in light of the European Energy Charter.
Claimants argue that the EC lacks support for its assertion that it was “never
intended that the ECT should influence [the EU’s] internal energy policy”. 309

Claimants assert that the part of Johann Basedow’s doctoral thesis that the EC

cited does not support the EC’s contention.’ Further, Claimants argue that Dr.

Basedow’s doctoral thesis shows that the EU’s stance during ECT negotiations

was opposed to carve-outs for certain signatories that the EC seeks to establish.>”!

322. As additional context, Claimants cast doubt upon the EC’s contention, by way
of analogy to the WTO treaties, that EU Member States have a practice of not
undertaking inter se obligations and always negotiate multilateral treaties with the
EU as “one single block”.*”? Claimants pose as a counterexample a WTO dispute
brought by Denmark against the Eu.

323. Further relating to the context and interpretation of the ECT, Claimants allude
to the EC’s Declaration dated 20 May 2015 on behalf of the EU in relation to the
International Energy Charter, arguing that the EC has effectively “admitted” that

“something more” is needed to exclude intra-EU disputes from the ECT’s dispute
settlement mechanisms.*”*

324. Claimants also assert that arbitral awards and scholarly writing, most of which
was referenced in their Reply Memorial, support their position. Claimants refer,
additionally, to ECT and BIT awards post-dating their Reply Memorial that have
similarly rejected intra-EU jurisdictional objections.*” Claimants also seek to
bolster support for the Charanne and RREEF Infrastructure awards, which
Claimants contend were based on the ECT’s clear terms and on Christian Tietje’s
article, which Claimants assert is consistent with other scholarly writings cited in
the Reply Memorial.*”°

325. Claimants next turn to the EC’s contentions that the Member States lacked
competence to enter into the ECT’s investment protection and dispute resolution
provisions, and therefore Respondent lacked international capacity to consent to,
and be accountable for, such obligations.

326. First, Claimants deny the EC’s assertion that the EU had or acquired exclusive
competence over investment protection and dispute resolution mechanisms.*””
According to Claimants, the EU gained exclusive competence over “foreign direct
investment”, one facet of the EU’s “common commercial policy”, when the
Lisbon Treaty came into force in 2009, but lacked exclusive competence in 1998
when the ECT came into force.*”* Second, the ECJ’s 16 May 2017 opinion
allegedly confirms that the EU and Member States possess shared competence
over non-direct investments and investor-state dispute settlement.*” Claimants
allege that “non-direct investments” include “a number of categories of covered
Investments as defined in Article 1(6) of the ECT”.*®° Therefore, Claimants
argue, even after the TFEU’s adoption, Member States still retain competence to

conclude treaties implicating inter se obligations.**!

327. Claimants also deny the relevance of TFEU Article 3(2), which allegedly

affirms the EU’s exclusive competence over international agreements that “may
affect common [EU] rules or alter their scope” and dispute the significance of the
Pringle decision.>*? First, the ECT came into force in 1998, before the adoption of
TFEU Article 3(2). Second, the EU, during ECT negotiations, was within its
competence and also well placed to prevent Member States from acting outside
their competence, e.g., by including a disconnection clause. Third, the Pringle
decision found no incompatibility with EU law where a Member State concluded a
treaty that did not jeopardize EU rules or frustrate the EU’s exercise of its
competences.*** Claimants assert that the ECT does not impede EU objectives or
threaten the ECJ’s authority on EU law, but instead “establishes an additional

- : 9 3
layer or protection for investors”.***

328. In connection with the above arguments regarding competences, Claimants

contend that Member States’ capacity to be bound by a treaty cannot depend upon
the “EU’s internal distribution of competences”, nor may a state “invoke the

provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.”*8°

329. Claimants next seek to counter the EC’s argument that, since intra~EU

obligations under the ECT would conflict with TFEU Articles 267 and 344, the
Tribunal should find that EU law supersedes the inconsistent ECT provisions
pursuant to VCLT Articles 30 and 41 or TFEU Article 351. Claimants’ arguments
here parallel their responses to Italy’s intra-EU objections.

330. Claimants first address the premise of VCLT Article 30, that the ECT’s

Claimants’

investor-state arbitration provisions are inconsistent with the TFEU. Claimants
assert that TFEU Article 267 is inapplicable, as there is no issue involving
interpretation of EU law. 386 Furthermore, according to Claimants, even if there
were an issue of EU law, then the Svea Court of Appeal, the Swedish court
competent to hear a motion to set aside this Award, would have the ability to
request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ, thus allegedly satisfying Article 267.
Claimants contest the EC’s assertion that investment arbitrations and commercial

arbitrations are different in any relevant sense and note that the EC incorrectly
asserted that the present case is an ICSID case.>*

331. As for TFEU Article 344, preventing Member States from “submit[ting] a
dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method
of settlement other than those provided for therein”, Claimants assert that it is
inapplicable here, as it only encompasses disputes involving Member States or EU
institutions, not investor-state disputes.“”” Claimants also assert that the phrase
“of the Treaties” refers to the TFEU and the Treaty on the European Union (TEU),
which does not include the ECT.*” According to Claimants, there is no risk of a

conflict with Article 344 in this case, because there is no need to interpret EU law

at all, and the possibility of the Tribunal taking EU law into account when
interpreting non-EU law would not conflict with Article 344.°°' Claimants cite to
the Electrabel award for the view that the ECJ recognizes that its “exclusive
jurisdiction does not prevent numerous other courts and arbitral tribunals from
applying EU law”, concluding that even if the Tribunal takes EU law into account,
there is no conflict with TFEU Article 344.°”°

 

332. Claimants argue that even if VCLT Article 30 were applicable, an inter se
modification of the ECT that excluded investor-state arbitration would violate
VCLT Article 41 because it would be incompatible with the ECT’s “object and
purpose..., which is to promote foreign energy investments in part by ensuring
investors’ rights to arbitration.”*??

333. In response to the EC’s contention that TFEU Article 351, by omitting to refer
to agreements between Member States, implies that such agreements could be
superseded by EU law, Claimants argue that the ECT is not within the temporal
scope of Article 351, which refers to agreements “concluded before 1 January
1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession.”**! Further,
Claimants note that Article 351 refers to agreements “between one or more
Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other”,

whereas the ECT is an agreement between all Member States as well as the EU,
and thus may not fall within the scope of Article 351.35

334. Finally, just as in their response to Italy’s application of ECT Article 16,
Claimants assert that Article 16 requires that parts III and V of the ECT prevail
over any conflicting treaty that offers less favorable rights. Claimants assert that
the ability to pursue arbitration in a neutral forum is more favorable to investors
than pursuing litigation in the Italian domestic courts.*°°

d. Tribunal Analysis

335. Asa preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes the significant overlap between
Respondent’s submissions and the EC’s Amicus brief on the Respondent’s intra-
EU jurisdictional objection. Their arguments are not, however, identical.
Nonetheless, Respondent declined to submit observations with respect to the EC’s
Amicus brief, communicating by e-mail on 30 May 2017 that, “the position of the
Commission largely coincide with that of Italy and consequently the Respondent
feels no need to further elaborate on individual points.” Accordingly, while the
Tribunal has considered each of the arguments expressed by Respondent and the
EC, given their extensive overlap, the Tribunal focuses on the main strands of
argument.

336. As explained below, the Tribunal finds the arguments for the intra-EU
jurisdictional objection unpersuasive. Further, for reasons explained in Part
V.B.4. of this Award, the European Court of Justice’s decision in Achmea, and
other legal authorities and positions expressed thereafter, do not lead to a different
result.

(i) Alleged ab initio intention to exclude intra-EU disputes

337. The Tribunal has considered Respondent’s contention that the ECT was
intended, ab initio, to exclude intra-EU disputes, and concludes that Respondent
cannot be correct, as is clear from the ECT itself and a consistent line of arbitral
jurisprudence.

338. As is clear from the text of the ECT, there is no express provision excluding
intra-EU disputes. Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that the ECT does not contain
any implied “disconnection clause”. Had the EU and Member States sought to

°° Claimants’ Observations on Amicus Brief, 4 54.

101

exclude intra-EU disputes from the scope of the substantive and procedural
protections under ECT Parts III and V, the Tribunal concludes that they would
have done so by means of an express exclusion. The Tribunal is not persuaded
otherwise by the textual and contextual references cited by Respondent and the
EC.

339. For example, Respondent suggests that ECT Articles 16 and 25 show an
intention to preclude the application of Article 26 to intra-EU disputes.* °7
Respondent mentions Article 16, expressing that investors and investments will
benefit from the “more favourable” provision in case of conflict between an earlier
or later treaty whose terms relate to ECT Parts III or V. Respondent also notes
that Italy, Denmark and Luxembourg entered into the EU treaties before the ECT,
which Respondent claims address the same subject matter as the latter. Further,
Respondent asserts that the EU treaties provide superior forms of investment
protection and dispute resolution compared with those provided for under the
ECT. Respondent refers to ECT Article 25, expressing that EU Member States
need not extend the “preferential treatment” that they owe one another to third
states, as. suggesting that a more favorable regime applies as between EU Member
States.

340. The Tribunal is not persuaded that the EU treaties offer EU investors a more
favorable treatment with respect to either substantive protections or dispute
resolution compared to the treatment accorded under ECT Parts III and V. Of
particular relevance here is that investor-State arbitration is not provided for by the
EU treaties. The Tribunal considers that Claimants correctly assert that “Article
16 cannot be used to deny a benefit that the ECT affords to investors.”*”

341. Furthermore, although EU Member States may accord each other preferential
treatment pursuant to ECT Article 25, this in itself does not demonstrate that the
EU treaties provide for a dispute resolution method more favorable to investors
and investments than ECT Article 26. The Tribunal therefore does not consider
ECT Article 25 to be relevant to the interpretation of Article 16. Respondent does
not explain how court litigation against a host state in the host state’s courts could
be more favourable to investors than investor-State arbitration before a neutral
arbitral tribunal independent of the host state. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that
an application of ECT Article 16 to the respective dispute resolution methods
provided for under EU law and under ECT Article 26 would result in the latter
prevailing over the former.

342. The Tribunal also notes that arbitral jurisprudence has rejected the notion that
the ECT contains an “implicit disconnection clause” that would exclude intra-EU
disputes from application of ECT Article 26, holding that any exclusion for intra-
EU disputes would have to be made expressly.4” As aptly put by the tribunal in
RREEF Infrastructure v. Spain:

[W]hen the very essence of a treaty to which the EU is a party is at
issue, ... then precisely because the EU is a party to the treaty a
formal warning that EU law would prevail over the treaty, such as
that contained in a disconnection clause, would have been required
under international law.

This follows from the basic public international law principle of
pacta sunt servanda. If one or more parties to a treaty wish to
exclude the application of that treaty in certain respect or
circumstances, they must either make a reservation (excluded in the
present case by Article 46 of the ECT) or include an unequivocal
disconnection clause in the treaty itself. The attempt to construe an
implicit clause into Article 26 of the ECT is untenable, given that that
article already contains express exceptions to the “unconditional
consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or
conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article” that
had been agreed amongst the States Party.*°!

343. That the lack of an express carve-out for intra-EU disputes implies the absence
of such an exclusion is shown by the existence of certain specific exceptions. This
was well explained by the tribunal in Eiser Infrastructure v. Spain:

Treaty law and practice provide familiar mechanisms for treaty
makers wishing to limit or exclude application of particular
provisions in particular situations. These were known and used in the
ECT’s texts, including by the predecessor to the European Union and
its member countries. The treaty includes multiple limiting decisions
and understandings, such as those providing that the treaty

concerning Spitsbergen prevails over inconsistent provisions of the
ECT in case of a conflict and limiting the scope of the treaty to
“Economic Activities in the Energy Sector.” In like vein, the
European Communities and the Russian Federation agreed that trade
in nuclear materials should be regulated by separate bilateral
arrangements. Yet the EEC sought no similar clarifying provisions
regarding what Respondent now contends is a major exclusion in the
ECT’s coverage. Respondent contends that no such express exclusion
was included in the ECT because, for reasons analyzed below, it was
obviously not required. The Tribunal is not persuaded.“

(ii) Alleged inter se modification of ECT by the Lisbon Treaty

344. The Tribunal has considered Respondent’s alternative contention that, even if
the ECT did not originally preclude intra-EU disputes, the adoption of the Lisbon
Treaty in 2007 was a legitimate inter se agreement whereby EU Member States
removed intra-EU disputes from the scope of ECT Article 26. Respondent’s
arguments rely on Articles 30 and 41 of the VCLT. As explained below, the
Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s arguments that the Lisbon Treaty
modified the ECT as between EU Member States.

345. Article 30 of the VCLT, titled “Application of Successive Treaties Relating to
the Same Subject-Matter”, provides as follows:

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the
rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating
to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the
following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to
be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the
provisions of that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the
later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent
that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the
parties to the earlier one:

(a) As between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as
in paragraph 3;

(b) As between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only
one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs
their mutual rights and obligations.

ARB/13/36, Award, 4 May 2017, J 187, CLA-184 (internal citations omitted).

104

5. Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any
question of the termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty
under article 60 or to any question of responsibility which may arise
for a State from the conclusion or application of a treaty the
provisions of which are incompatible with its obligations towards
another State under another treaty.

346. Asa preliminary matter, the Tribunal is not persuaded that VCLT Article 30 is
applicable to the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty at all, insofar as Respondent has not
demonstrated that the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty are “successive treaties relating
to the same subject-matter”, as VCLT Article 30(1) would require. The Tribunal’s
position here is consistent with that of the Electrabel tribunal in finding that the
ECT and EU law do not have the same subject matter.*°? Nonetheless, even if the
ECT and the Lisbon Treaty were related to the same subject matter, the Tribunal
could not conclude from Respondent’s arguments based on VCLT Articles 30(2)
and 30(4) that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

347. As regards VCLT Article 30(2), Respondent suggests that this provision
encompasses ECT Article 16, as Article 16 “specifies that [the ECT] is subject to”
a treaty “more favourable” than it with regard to provisions under ECT Parts III
and V. Respondent, asserting that the Lisbon Treaty is more favorable to
investors than the ECT, concludes that the Lisbon Treaty prevails over the ECT in
those respects.

348. The Tribunal considers that Respondent’s interpretation does not accord with
the meaning of VCLT Article 30(2). ECT Article 16 does not “specify” that the
ECT is subject to “an earlier or later treaty”, nor does it refer to any particular
treaty at all. Article 16 instead expresses a more general mechanism whereby a
treaty with more favorable provisions is to apply. Thus, irrespective of whether
the Lisbon Treaty provided more favorable or less favorable terms than the ECT,
which is a question that could be addressed in the context of ECT Article 16 (and
without reference to VCLT Article 30(2)), Article 16 is not the kind of treaty
provision described by VCLT Article 30(2). Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects
Respondent’s argument regarding VCLT Article 30(2).

349. With respect to VCLT Article 30(4)(a), which refers to Article 30(3),
Respondent contends that “between EU Member States the ECT would only apply
to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of EU law.45

Respondent states that application of the ECT in an intra-EU context conflicts
with EU law based on the Lisbon Treaty’s re-allocation of external competences
regarding certain matters.*°°

350. The Tribunal finds no inconsistency, however, between the ECT and EU law,
in accord with prior ECT jurisprudence.*”” The Tribunal here refers to the
contention by Respondent and the EC that the ECT and TFEU Article 344 are in
conflict. TFEU Article 344 provides that EU member states “undertake not to
submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any
method of settlement other than those provided for therein.” The Tribunal
considers that Claimants are correct in their assertion that Article 344 relates to
disputes involving Member States or EU institutions, not investor-State
disputes. Nor does the present arbitration concern the interpretation or
application of the EU treaties, but instead concerns rights and obligations under
the ECT. Thus, the Tribunal finds no inconsistency between the ECT and TFEU
Article 344.

351. Accordingly, as there is no conflict with EU law, if the Tribunal were to apply
VCLT Article 30(4)(a), referring to Article 30(3), the Tribunal would conclude
that the ECT applies to its full extent, not limited in any way by EU law.

352. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s objections to the applicability
of the ECT in an intra-EU context. Even if Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT were
applicable, it would be “without prejudice to Article 41” of the VCLT, as provided
in Article 30(5) of the Treaty, requiring the Tribunal to consider whether the
Lisbon Treaty’s alleged modification of the ECT, as between the EU Contracting
Parties, conflicts with Article 41 of the VCLT.

353. Article 41 of the VCLT, titled “Agreements to Modify Multilateral Treaties
Between Certain of the Parties Only”, provides as follows:

1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may
conclude an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves
alone if:

(a) The possibility of such a modification is provided for by the

treaty; or

(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their
rights under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;
(ii) Does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is
incompatible with the effective execution of the object and
purpose of the treaty as a whole.

2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph I(a) the treaty
otherwise provides, the parties in question shall notify the other
parties of their intention to conclude the agreement and of the
modification to the treaty for which it provides.

354. Respondent and the EC both argued that “de-activating” the ECT’s investment
protection and dispute resolution provisions by inter se modification pursuant to
the Lisbon Treaty would not violate VCLT Article 41(1)(b)(ii) because it would
not “be incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the
treaty as a whole.“ Although the positon of the Respondent and the EC remains
somewhat unclear on this matter, they seem to rely, on the premise that non-EU
investors could still invoke the ECT’s investment protection and dispute
resolution provisions, which is more relevant to Article 41(1)(b)(i), addressing the
“enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the treaty”."° Claimants, in
turn, assert that eliminating the possibility to pursue investor-State arbitration
would frustrate the ECT’s “object and purpose ... to promote foreign energy
investments by ensuring investors’ rights to arbitration.”“!! In this connection, the
Tribunal has not been persuaded by the reasoning of the Respondent and the EC in
relation to VCLT 41(1)(b)(ii). Rather, their reasoning seems more relevant to
Article 41(1)(b)(i). On the other hand, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to
determine whether suppression of ECT Article 26 in relation to EU investors
would be “incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of
the treaty [i-e., the ECT] as a whole” under Article 41(1)(b)(ii), since it has already
found that Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT is not applicable in the present context.

355. The EC raised an additional argument based on TFEU Article 351 to the effect
that it suggests that prior agreements among Member States are superseded by the
TFEU in case of any inconsistency.*" Claimants observed, in this connection,
that Article 351 refers to “agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for
acceding States, before the date of their accession”, and therefore that the ECT is
outside the relevant temporal scope. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants, and also
notes that Article 351 refers to incompatibility between the earlier agreement and
the TFEU. The Tribunal, having found no inconsistency between the ECT and
TFEU, concludes that TFEU Article 351 is inapplicable here.

4. The Achmea Decision and post-Achmea Matters regarding Intra-EU Objection

a. Invitation to File Observations

356. As noted in the Procedural History (Part II of this Award), on 6 March 2018,
the European Court of Justice issued its judgment in the case of Slovak Republic v.
Achmea (the “Achmea Decision”, as defined above).*'* Shortly thereafter, the
Tribunal invited the Parties to submit observations on any impact that the Achmea
Decision might have on the present arbitration. The Tribunal received
observations from both sides on 23 March 2018.

357. Following the Parties’ submissions on the Achmea Decision, the Tribunal
accepted the filing of observations by both sides regarding three subsequent items
of possible relevance to the Achmea Decision and other aspects of this dispute. As
detailed in the Procedural History, both sides simultaneously submitted
observations:

on 6 July 2018, regarding the 16 May 2018 award in Masdar Solar & Wind
Cooperatief v. Spain;’\4

on 20 July 2018, regarding the 15 June 2018 award in Antin Infrastructure
Services Luxembourg et al. v. Spain and the 2 May 2018 award in Antaris Solar
et al. vy. Czech Republic;*'° and

© on 8 August 2018, regarding the EC’s 19 July 2018 Communication on
protection of intra-EU investment.*"°

358. The below summaries and analysis of submissions on the Achmea Decision
and post-Achmea developments focus on issues relating to the intra-EU
jurisdictional objection. However, the Parties’ submissions on post-Achmea
developments extend beyond those issues, discussing the merits of the substantive

413 Judgment of 6 March 2018, Slowakische Republik v. Achmea B.V., European Court of Justice (Grand Chamber),
Case C-284/16, CLA-194. The Tribunal has noted a variance in citation to Achmea, sometimes with reference to
ECJ (European Court of Justice), sometimes CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union). Our understanding is
that the CJEU is a judicial institution seated in Luxembourg comprised of two different courts, the Court of Justice
(with one judge from each EU country) which addresses inter alia requests for rulings from national courts, and the
General Court, which rules on actions for annulment brought by individuals and companies.

claims under ECT Article 10(1) and the Taxation Measures exclusion under ECT
Article 21. The Parties’ submissions on the impact of the post-Achmea
developments on these latter issues are not addressed in this section.

b. Claimants’ Observations on Achmea Decision

359. Claimants submit that the Achmea Decision lacks any relevance to the present
arbitration for four main reasons.

360. First, Claimants assert that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is exclusively grounded
in ECT Article 26, whose express requirements are met in the present case, and
thus the Tribunal must exercise its jurisdiction and proceed to render an award on
the merits.“!” Claimants cite recent ECT arbitral awards affirming that approach
when faced with similar intra-EU objections.*"* According to Claimants, the
reference in ECT Article 26(6) to “this Treaty and applicable rules and principles
of international law” does not support an interpretation whereby EU law enters
into the Tribunal’s jurisdictional analysis through the “back door”, given the
ECT’s clear and explicit jurisdictional requirements. Claimants assert that such an
interpretation has been flatly rejected by other tribunals and is unsupported by
principles of treaty interpretation under the VCLT.‘"? One reason for not finding
that Article 26(6) incorporates EU law is, according to Claimants, that the ECT is
a multilateral instrument to which many non-EU Member States are Contracting
Parties.

361. Second, according to Claimants, the Achmea Decision does nothing to upset
recent arbitral jurisprudence, which has rejected any interpretation of the ECT
expressly or impliedly excluding intra-EU disputes from the ECT’s scope,*”! and
has found, in parallel with scholarly writings, that the ECT and EU law neither
conflict with one another nor share the same subject matter.“ Further supporting

an absence of any conflict, Claimants invoke Advocate General Wathelet’s
opinion in the Achmea case, stating that the EC could not “offer the slightest
explanation of how the prohibition of illegal expropriation [under the Netherlands-
Slovakia BIT] is incompatible with the EU and FEU Treaties.”*?? In the present
arbitration, Claimants assert, they have not submitted any claims based on EU
law, but only claims based on provisions of the ECT and under public
international law.‘**

362. Further, Claimants argue, even if the ECT and EU law were to conflict, which
Claimants deny, then ECT Article 16 would prevail over conflicting provisions of
EU law, including the ECJ’s interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU in
the Achmea Decision.*> Under Article 16(2), Claimants assert, no provision of
any prior or subsequent agreement involving the Contracting Parties may derogate
from any provision of the ECT that is more favourable to the Investor or
Investment, including international arbitration under ECT Article 26.6
Claimants submit that the ECJ’s prior jurisprudence considers a right to recourse
to international arbitration to be “the most essential element of the BITs” and “an
indispensable guarantee that encourages and protects investments.”*””

363. Third, Claimants argue that even if the Achmea Decision is relevant to
disputes under certain BITs, there are two different aspects that distinguish it from
the present arbitration. First, the Achmea Decision concerned an arbitration
provision of an intra-EU BIT to which the EU is not a party. According to
Claimants, the ECJ expressly limited the application of the Achmea Decision to
cases involving “a provision [for investor-state arbitration] in an international

agreement concluded between Member States ...’*”* and cases involving “an

agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by the Member States.”*”
Similarly, the ECJ held in another case that an investor-state dispute under the
EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement could be resolved through international
arbitration, as long as both the EU and the Member States approved of this
option.*° Thus, Claimants assert, the EU’s participation as a Contracting Party to
the ECT is one key difference between this case and that addressed by the Achmea
Decision.

364. A second aspect that differs, according to Claimants, is that the ECJ’s decision

relied on the governing law clause of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, containing
two provisions absent from ECT Article 26(6).**! Claimants argue that the ECJ’s
concern was that the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT referred to “the law in force of the
Contracting Party concerned” and “other relevant Agreements between the
Contracting Parties”, which could implicate the application of EU law. Claimants
submit that the ECT’s governing law clause, requiring decision “in accordance
with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law”, does not
implicate the interpretation or application of EU law.**?

365. Fourth, Claimants submit that any potential impact of the Achmea Decision on

the enforcement of the award in this arbitration is currently unknown, “likely to be
minimal to nonexistent”, and in any case irrelevant to the Tribunal’s mandate.**
Claimants cite Micula v. Romania, in which the tribunal chose not to address
arguments regarding enforceability based on matters of EU law that might arise
after rendering the award.***

c. Respondent’s Observations on Achmea Decision

366. Respondent submits that the Achmea Decision “confirms the lack of

jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals under Article 26 ECT in intra-EU investment
disputes.”"*> This is because, Respondent argues, the ECJ concluded that an offer

of arbitration from a Member State to an EU investor under the ECT would
“violate[] Articles 267 and 344 TFEU and the general principle of autonomy of
the Union Law” and thus be incompatible with EU law.**° Respondent’s
reasoning, briefly summarized below, to some extent repeats its earlier
submissions on jurisdiction.

367. On one hand, Respondent argues that EU law is part of international law,
concluding that the reference to “applicable rules and principles of international
law” in ECT Article 26(6) would require a tribunal to apply EU law in an intra-EU
dispute under the EcT.*” Further, an ECT investor-state tribunal cannot,
according to Respondent, make a preliminary reference to the ECJ under Article
267 TFEU, given the ECJ’s position expressed in the Achmea Decision.*** Thus,
asserts Respondent, the ECT established a “mechanism for settling investment
disputes that is not capable of ensuring the proper application and full
effectiveness of EU law.”*”

368. Respondent suggests that the facts and circumstances of the Achmea Decision
do not differ in any relevant way from the present case, according no significance
to the EU’s role as Contracting Party to the ECT.“ In Respondent’s view, what
is relevant is the bilateral offer to arbitrate “that Italy assumed towards
Luxembourg investors”, which it alleges is “exactly identical to the situation of
Article 8 of the Slovak-Dutch BIT that was before the Court of Justice in
Achmea.! Respondent refers to commentary published shortly after issuance of
the Achmea Decision that it considers to support its interpretation.*” Respondent
also asserts that, even if an award is rendered outside the EU or under ICSID
tules, the Achmea Decision implies that such awards still conflict with EU law.“8

369. Respondent asserts that the Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet filed with
the ECJ on 19 September 2017 is superseded by the Achmea Decision and thus
irrelevant.“* Respondent also suggests that the Advocate General’s Opinion
relies incorrectly on the assumption that arbitral tribunals are able to make
preliminary references to the ECJ under TFEU Article 267.45

370. Further, Respondent suggests that an ECT award in an intra-EU scenario
could not be enforced without the EC’s authorization. Respondent submits that
this is “evidence of the institutional conflict that application of the ECT to intra-
EU disputes would cause”.**°

d. The Parties’ Comments on post-Achmea Developments

(i) The Masdar award

371. Claimants assert that the Masdar award is of critical importance as, allegedly,
the first ECT award rendered since the Achmea Decision.” Claimants contend
that the Masdar award confirms their view that the Achmea Decision is irrelevant
to investor-State disputes under the ECT, noting that the EU is an ECT
Contracting Party.“ Claimants place emphasis on the following passage from the
Masdar award:

The Achmea Judgment is of limited application — first, and
specifically, to the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal
protection of investment between the Kingdom of the Netherlands
and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and, second, in a more
general perspective, to any “provision in an international agreement
concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the
Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative
Republic.” The ECT is not such a treaty. Thus, the Achmea Judgment
does not take into consideration, and thus it cannot be applied to,
multilateral treaties, such as the ECT, to which the EU itself is a
party.

372. According to Claimants, the above passage confirms a distinction which
Claimants allege that the Achmea Decision has drawn, between intra-EU BITs
“concluded not by the EU but by Member States”, on one hand, and multilateral
treaties to which the EU is a party, on the other.**° Claimants state that the
Masdar award adopted the reasoning of Advocate General Wathelet in his
Opinion, that “...if no EU institution and no Member State sought an opinion
from the Court on the compatibility of that treaty [the ECT] with the EU and FEU
Treaties, that is because none of them had the slightest suspicion that it might be
incompatible.”**! Further, according to Claimants, the Masdar award interpreted
the Achmea Decision as not having rejected Advocate General Wathelet’s opinion
but instead as being “simply silent on the subject of the ECT.”*

373. Claimants further submit that the Masdar award rejected several variants of
intra-EU objections. First, Claimants interpret the Masdar award as supporting
their position that the ECT’s text contains nothing that precludes intra-EU
disputes.** Specifically, Claimants refer to a paragraph from an unpublished
award in the PV Investors v. Spain arbitration, quoted in the Masdar award.***
According to that paragraph, Claimants submit, the presence in the ECT of a
provision on potential conflict with the Svalbard Treaty, a treaty less significant
than the EU treaties, suggests that if the EU had desired to exclude intra-EU
disputes from the ECT’s scope, it had methods to do so.**°

374. Claimants interpret the Masdar award as rejecting the view that TFEU Article
344 precludes intra-EU arbitration, instead joining a number of other cases finding
that the ECT and BU law do not conflict.**° Finally, Claimants interpret the
Masdar award as confirming that the ECT is more favorable to investors than EU
law because the ECT provides for the possibility of investor-State arbitration and
thus, under ECT Article 16, prevails over EU law to the extent of any
inconsistency between them.**7

375. Respondent, for its part, submits that the Masdar award is not only irrelevant,
as it concerned different circumstances from those involved here, but also

incorrectly interpreted the Achmea Decision and the Opinion of Advocate General
‘Wathelet, and thus reached an incorrect result on jurisdiction.*** Respondent
suggests, additionally, that the Masdar award is not binding on the present
tribunal, unlike the Achmea Decision.*”

376. In relation to the Masdar award’s interpretation of the Achmea Decision,
Respondent states that the Masdar tribunal was incorrect in interpreting the ECJ’s
reasoning as being inapplicable to multilateral treaties like the ECT.

Respondent submits several different grounds for its interpretation of the Achmea
Decision’s reasoning as being applicable to the ECT. First, Respondent relies on a
literal interpretation of the Achmea Decision, arguing that the ECT falls within the
description of “an international agreement concluded between Member States
under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a
dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings
against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that
Member State has undertaken to accept”, even if the ECT also counts the EU as a
Contracting Party.*°!

377. Further, Respondent argues, the characteristics discussed by the ECJ, such as
the autonomy of EU law, the finality of investor-State arbitral awards, and the
inability of arbitral tribunals to make preliminary references to the ECJ under
TFEU Article 267, apply as much to multilateral as to bilateral treaties, which
Respondent asserts was misunderstood by the Masdar tribunal.“ Thus,
Respondent argues, the ECT’s arbitration provision would be incompatible with

EU law, as it would not ensure the “full effectiveness of EU law”.4

378. Next, Respondent contends that the Masdar award mischaracterizes the
Achmea Decision as not addressing (and thereby not denying) the Opinion of
Advocate General Wathelet, which the Masdar tribunal considers to have drawn a
distinction between the investor-State arbitration provisions of bilateral treaties
and those of multilateral treaties.4™ Respondent argues, instead, that paragraph 57

of the Achmea Decision is the ECJ’s response to Advocate General Wathelet’s
Opinion.“ Respondent concludes:

The ECJ recognizes that international Courts (not arbitral tribunals)
can be established in mixed agreements as far as this does not affect

the autonomy of the EU and its legal order. The situation is different
in the case of an arbitral tribunal...“

379. Respondent also asserts that the Masdar Award relied heavily on the Opinion
of Advocate General Wathelet but that the latter was an “extremely shaky
authority”, since it had been rejected by the ECJ.“” In addition, Respondent
contends, the alleged “silence” by the ECJ regarding the alleged distinction drawn
by Advocate General Wathelet has no significance, given that the ECJ has no
obligation to address the views of Advocates General.*

(ii) The Antin and Antaris awards

380. Claimants argue that the Antin award is consistent with other awards that have
addressed, and rejected, the intra-EU objection, such as the Charanne and Eiser
awards.“ According to Claimants, the Antin tribunal found that satisfaction of
the requirements of ECT Article 26 suffices for establishing the tribunal’s
jurisdiction, declining to find any exclusion in the ECT for intra-EU disputes.*””
Claimants refer to language in the Antin award stating that “[s]uch an exclusion
would have to be express and clear” and stating that Spain had not persuaded the
tribunal that the ECT contained such an exclusion.*”!

381. Claimants conclude that since the jurisdictional requirements of ECT Article
26 are met in the present case, the Tribunal should, like the tribunal in Antin, reject
Italy’s arguments in support of its intra-7EU objection.‘

382. In regard to the Antaris award, Claimants do not address any relevance it
might have in relation to the Achmea Decision or any matters relating to the intra-

EU objection, instead focusing on its relevance to substantive claims and

383. Respondent’s observations on the Antin and Antaris awards do not address the
Achmea Decision or any other matters relating to jurisdiction, but instead focus on
the potential relevance of those awards to the substantive claims.

(iii) The EC’s 19 July 2018 Communication

384. According to Claimants, the EC’s 19 July 2018 Communication to the EU
Parliament and the Council incorrectly interprets the significance of the Achmea
Decision.4”* Claimants assert that the EC is wrong to claim that the Achmea
Decision invalidates the investor-State arbitration provision of all intra-EU
BITs.4* According to Claimants, the Achmea Decision depended on the specific
governing law clause of the BIT in that case and does not apply to the ECT, which
has a different governing law provision and includes the EU as a Contracting
Party.*”* Claimants deny the EC’s position that the ECT must not be applied to
intra-EU disputes, alluding to their earlier comments on the Achmea Decision.*”°

385. Claimants also deny the EC Communication’s claim that, based on the
Achmea Decision, national courts must annul any award rendered under an intra-
BIT and terminate their intra-EU BITs.*””

386. Respondent states that the EC Communication is a non-binding instrument of
EU law that proclaims the EC’s policy stance and is important for “assessing the
content of EU treaties provisions to compare these with other commitments by
Member States under other international treaties such as the ECT....”“”* The EC
Communication, Respondent asserts, is an “authoritative interpretation” that
confirms Respondent’s view that the Achmea Decision extends to the intra-EU
application of ECT Article 26 and that the EU’s role as an ECT Contracting Party
is not relevant in that regard.*””

387. Respondent also asserts that the EC Communication provides an analysis of
EU law that shows that the EU treaties protect investments in the EU under terms
more favorable than those of the ECT.**” Respondent suggests that the application
of ECT Article 16 should therefore result in EU law superseding the ECT in intra-
EU investment disputes, and that enabling protection under both EU law and the
ECT may lead to forum shopping and double recovery.**! Respondent concludes
that the EC Communication strongly supports Respondent’s intra-EU
jurisdictional objection.‘

e. Tribunal Analysis

388. In connection with its jurisdiction to decide this dispute, the Tribunal has
considered the Parties’ submissions on the Achmea Decision,*** including their
references to the Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet filed with the ECJ on 19
September 2017,*84 as well as their submissions on certain matters after the
issuance of the Achmea Decision.“

389. The underlying dispute arose out of an investment in Slovakia, made by a
Dutch insurance group, which had challenged the reversal of certain measures to
liberalize the health insurance market in the Slovak Republic. The challenge was
brought pursuant to Article 8 of the 1992 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the
Netherlands and Czechoslovakia (as it then was).

390. The Dutch claimant (Achmea) opted (as permitted under the BIT) for
arbitration pursuant to the UNCITRAL Rules, before an arbitral tribunal seated in
Frankfurt, administered by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. A EUR 22
million award in favor of Achmea was challenged in an unsuccessful annulment
action before a court in Frankfurt, with appeal to the German BGH
(Bundesgerichtshof).

391. The host state, Slovakia, contended that the arbitration provisions of the BIT
were incompatible with certain provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union (TFEU), discussed below.

392. Although the arbitral tribunal did not purport to apply European Union Law,
the BGH referred to the ECJ the issue of whether the BIT had been incompatible
with EU law. In its decision, the ECJ addressed the effect of two provisions in the
TFEU: (i) Article 344, which provides that EU member states “undertake not to
submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any
method of settlement other than those provided for therein,” and (ii) Article 267,
providing inter alia that the ECJ “shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary
rulings concerning: (a) the interpretation of the Treaties; (b) the validity and
interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the
Union.”

393. The bottom line of the ECJ analysis was a ruling which in the English text
reads as follows:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and
reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under
which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event
of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept.

394. In passing, the Tribunal notes that the French text of that holding reads with
greater flexibility. The English employs the verb “to preclude” which might
imply that the TFEU imposes some supervening illegality that renders investor-
state arbitration per se invalid. In contrast, the French text uses the
verb “s opposer” which carries a notion of tension or incompatibility (as between
the TFEU and BIT arbitration) rather than supervening illegality: “Les articles
267 et 344 TFUE doivent étre interprétés en ce sens qu’ils s opposent a une
disposition [aux termes de laquelle un investisseur peut] introduire une procédure
..devant un tribunal arbitral.”

“8° Tn Light of its rulings on Articles 267 and 344, the ECJ found it unnecessary to answer a third question referred

by the German BGH, related to Article 18 of the TFEU, which provides, “Within the scope of application of the
Treaties, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of
nationality shall be prohibited.”

“87 Achmea Decision, J 62 (ruling), CLA-194.

119

395. Having carefully considered the ECJ decision in Achmea, the Tribunal
concludes that the decision has no preclusive effect such as to remove its
jurisdiction over the present dispute.

396. First, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the present proceedings derives from
Article 26 of the ECT, not an intra-European BIT. This Tribunal agrees with the
other arbitral tribunals that have held ECT jurisdiction satisfied by the terms of
Article 26 notwithstanding objections based on the character of a dispute as
between an EU investment and an EU host state.“**

397. Second, no difference in result can be derived from the choice of law
provision in the ECT Article 26(6), which states that an investor-state arbitral
tribunal “shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty [ECT]
and applicable rules and principles of international law.” In the context of the
arbitral jurisdiction created by the ECT, reference to “international law” cannot be
stretched to include EU law, absent doing violence to the text which would be
impermissible under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which in
Article 31(1) provides that a treaty “shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in
their context and in light of its object and purpose.” In that connection, the ECT
contains its clear requirement of a decision under “principles of international law”
which must in context refer to public international law, not EU law. The Tribunal
has not been called upon to apply EU law, since Claimants asserted breaches of
the ECT and international law, but not of EU law.

398. Third, the ECJ in Achmea was careful to confine its ruling to agreements
“concluded between Member States’**’, thereby leaving open the possibility of
dispute resolution pursuant to international agreements that are not “intra-EU” in
the sense of being concluded by Member States as among themselves.*”° In this
connection, the Tribunal notes that the ECT includes the EU as a signatory, along
with 25 states which are not EU members, as well as the 28 EU members.

399. The items on which the Parties have commented after the Achmea Decision,
where relevant, support the Tribunal’s reasoning. In particular, the Masdar award
supports the Tribunal’s finding that the Achmea Decision does not apply to a
treaty to which the EU and various non-EU Member States are contracting parties,

and which does not require a tribunal to apply EU law pursuant to a governing law
provision.*”!

400. The Tribunal notes that the Antin and Antaris awards, issued after the Achmea
Decision, did not address the latter’s potential significance. This is
understandable since the Antin tribunal had closed proceedings on 26 February
2018, prior to issuance of the Achmea Decision on 6 March 2018 and subsequent
request by Spain to reopen the proceedings." The Antaris tribunal denied the
Czech Republic’s request to admit the Achmea Decision on the ground that the
Czech Republic had expressly waived its EU-related jurisdictional objections.*”

401. Although the Antin award did not comment on the Achmea Decision, the
Tribunal nonetheless considers the Antin award as reinforcing the Tribunal’s
analysis and conclusions regarding Respondent’s intra-EU objections, for the
reasons Claimants provide.* As the Parties have not commented, however, on
the Antaris award’s potential relevance to intra-EU jurisdictional objections or the
Achmea Decision, such matter is not for the Tribunal to address.

402. With respect to the EC Communication of 19 July 2018, the Tribunal does not
agree with Respondent’s contention that this instrument “gives an authoritative
interpretation of the scope of Achmea since it does so as the guardian of the
European Union”.**> Both sides acknowledge that the EC Communication is not a
binding legal instrument.*”° Even if the EC Communication were authoritative in
respect of interpretation of the European Court of Justice’s decisions regarding EU
law, the Tribunal is not constituted pursuant to EU law nor does it interpret or
apply EU law.

403. For the reasons already expressed, the Tribunal does not consider that the
Achmea Decision has any preclusive effect on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the
present dispute.

1. Tariff Reductions under the Spalma-incentivi Decree

a. Claimants’ Position

404. Claimants argue that the reduction in tariff levels under Law Decree No.
91/2014, the Spalma-incentivi Decree,*” violated their legitimate expectations and
thus breached the FET clause of the ECT.

405. Claimants emphasize “legitimate expectations” as the main pillar of their
tripartite argument that Italy violated the FET clause of the ECT, with the notions
of transparency and consistency comprising the second pillar, and good faith
serving as the third pillar.“ According to Claimants, each of these notions
provides a freestanding basis for relief under the FET clause.” Moreover,
although a number of other alleged FET breaches have been cited (such as
requirements to pay retroactive administrative fees and imbalance costs,
cancellation of inflation adjustment for certain facilities, and modification of the
minimum price guarantee scheme, discussed infra), the reduction of the Conto
Energia tariff levels under the Spalma-incentivi Decree serves to underpin the
principal line of reasoning, given that this measure had the greatest financial
impact on Claimants’ investments.*”!

406. With respect to FET obligations, Claimants contend that the “legitimate
expectations” standard serves to discourage frustration of the basic expectations
and assumptions relied on by the foreign investor in making its investment, as
long as such expectations remain reasonable and legitimate.” Obviously, the
“expectations” under consideration would be those related to governmental
measures, not ordinary commercial and financial risks.

407. Claimants refer to the Parkerings case as accurately setting forth the standard
for determining the types of scenarios in which an investor’s legitimate
expectations can be said to arise:

(i) when an investor received an explicit promise or guarantee from a
government body as to a particular legal or regulatory provision;

(ii) when the investor received implicit promises or guarantees that it then took
into account in making its investment; or

(iii) | absent such assurances or representations, the circumstances surrounding the
investment were such as to give rise to a legitimate expectation.°°

408. According to Claimants, the evidence shows that organs and officials of the
Italian Republic made explicit promises or guarantees, as well as “informal” or
implicit assurances, that the incentive tariff rates granted under each of the Conto
Energia ministerial decrees would remain the same for twenty (20) years. Thus
Italy created conditions whereby photovoltaic investors formed legitimate
expectations that the incentive tariff rates would remain constant for two decades.
Claimants identify multiple categories of regulations, documents, statements,
policies, and behavior on which their expectations were based, including the
following:

(i) the Conto Energia decrees, each of which specified certain tariff rates for a
twenty-year period;*°>

(ii) the GSE Agreements, which also specified certain tariff rates for certain PV
facilities for a twenty-year period;°*°

(iii) the GSE letters informing PV operators of their eligibility under particular
Conto Energia decrees;>””

(iv) declarations of and publications by Italian national and regional authorities
and officials regarding the Conto Energia regime;>"* and

(v) the declared purposes and policies underlying the Conto Energia regime.>”

409. Claimants point to Conto II as one example from the Conto Energia
regulatory scheme that explicitly assured investors of a constant tariff rate. For
example, Article 6(1) of Conto II provides, “[t]he tariff identified on the basis of
[the] table [inserted at the end of Article 6(1)] is awarded for a period of twenty
years commencing from the date of entry into operation of the plant and shall
remain constant in current currency for the entire twenty year period.” Also,
Article 6(2) of Conto II (relating to PV plants that become operational after those
referred to in Article 6(1)) provides, “[tJhe value of the tariff shall remain constant
in legal tender for the aforementioned twenty-year period.”*!°

410. As an additional illustration, Claimants cite Article 2 of the GSE Agreement
made pursuant to Conto II with Martano Solenergy (a NovEnergia/NIP
investment). That agreement provides, “[f]or a 20-year period as of 9 February
2011, the incentive tariff, in regular installments in the applicable currency, to be
recognized to the photovoltaic plant mentioned in this Agreement, is equal to
0,3460 Euro/kWh....”°!! That excess (or supplemental) tariff would be earned
over the normal market rate.

411. Given the varied types of express assurances made by Italy, its state organs or
officials, Claimants argue for a paradigm case of a host state causing investors
reasonably to form expectations that a regulatory regime will remain constant for a
fixed period.>”” Claimants compare their circumstances to the facts of the Micula
v. Romania case, in which the tribunal found that Romania created legitimate
expectations by offering a ten-year tax holiday to investors in certain parts of
Romania, but revoking them after only four-and-a-half years.°3 Considering that,
in Micula, there was no specific contractual arrangement like the GSE
Agreements, Claimants argue that their case presents an even stronger showing of
legitimate expectations.°!* In Micula, on one hand, there were regulations and
eligibility letters. Here, on the other hand, there are Conto Energia decrees,
authorization letters, and GSE Agreements.

412. Similar to their comparison with Micula, Claimants argue for a jurisprudence
constante in which ECT tribunals have held Spain liable for modifying renewable
energy incentives in a context allegedly providing fewer grounds to form
legitimate expectations than available to Claimants here>! According to

Claimants, in the Masdar case, discussed supra in relation to jurisdiction, the
tribunal unanimously held that Spain had made a specific commitment that
claimants’ plants would benefit from certain incentives throughout their operating
lives.°'® Claimants note that the Spanish incentives framework at issue in Masdar
involved, first, letters from the Spanish Ministry confirming each plant’s
eligibility to obtain the incentive tariffs, and second, final certificates of
registration that confirmed that plants were entitled to participate in the specific
feed-in tariff scheme provided in a Spanish decree.*!”

413. According to Claimants, Italy’s commitments to PV investors are

“significantly stronger and more specific” than those which the Masdar tribunal
found Spain to have made.*!* First, whereas the Spanish tariff scheme
registrations and Ministry letters refer back to the general regulation setting forth
the applicable tariffs, the GSE letters state the exact tariff rate applicable to each
plant, down to the thousandth of a Euro cent per kWy/hour.!? Second, the GSE
letters state that the tariff will be constant for twenty years, whereas the Spanish
regulations do not provide for a specific time period or refer to a constant rate.”°
Additionally, Spain did not use contracts under its incentive regime, whereas each
eligible PV producer benefitting from the Conto Energia regime entered into GSE
Agreements providing for an exact tariff rate, fixed for twenty years.”

414. Claimants allege that they would not have made the investments at issue

Als.

without having received assurances of stability.°?? In support of this point,

Claimants refer to articles written by international law firms, consulting firms, and
banks suggesting that such reliance was reasonable under the circumstance
prevailing at the times leading up to their investments.

Each of the options under the Spalma-incentivi Decree (options A, B and C),
according to Claimants, “significantly reduced the value of the incentives that
Italy had promised to pay photovoltaic producers for twenty years”.** In that
manner, the Spalma-incentivi Decree violated the express terms of the Conto

Energia decrees, the GSE Agreements, and other specific assurances that the tariff
rates would remain constant for a twenty-year period.

416. Claimants argue that the parties to the ECT accepted limitations on their
power to modify legislation governing investments, at least insofar as the
legislation generated legitimate expectations of stability by giving explicit
assurances of the type described above.°** Accordingly, Claimants argue that
Italy’s clear assurances effectively waived any right to regulate insofar as the
subsequent exercise of sovereign prerogative would defeat the expectations that
investors had formed based on those assurances.**” According to Claimants, “[iJt
is common ground in investment treaty jurisprudence that when an investor’s
expectations are based on explicit assurances from the State — as in the present
case — the State has accepted limitations on its right to regulate in ways that
undermine those assurances.”***

417. As noted above, in addition their legitimate expectations argument, Claimants
argue that the tariff reductions violated the FET clause by failing “to encourage
and create stable, equitable, favourable, and transparent conditions for investors”,
pursuant to the first sentence of ECT Article 10(1). Specifically, Claimants assert,
the tariff reductions under the Spalma-incentivi Decree undermined the
transparent and consistent conditions created by the Italian incentive scheme,
including the Conto Energia decrees, which had “enabled Claimants to know from

the outset the revenues their facilities would earn”.

418. Claimants also contend that Italy violated the FET standard by failing to treat
Claimants investments in good faith, citing prior investment tribunals for the
notion that good faith conduct is implicit in the fair and equitable treatment
standard.°*° Broadly, Claimants argue that for Italy to receive the full benefits of
Claimants’ PV investments while not providing Claimants with the benefits under
the Conto Energia regime as originally promised was not in good faith.*!
According to Claimants, the purported rationale for the tariff reductions, namely,

to reduce the costs of electricity bills for end-consumers, was not a “good faith
reason or excuse”. Instead, assert Claimants, it was an illegitimate political
decision to re-allocate the costs from end-consumers to PV producers after the
latter had already paid for the bulk of their investments up front and were
effectively trapped in Italy.>

419. Aside from their FET arguments, Claimants contend that the reductions
violated the ECT’s impairment clause and umbrella clause (the third and fifth
sentences of Article 10(1), respectively). The Tribunal notes, however, that these
arguments merely serve to buttress Claimants’ main argument based on legitimate
expectations under FET. Thus, they are only briefly summarized below.

420. Claimants argue that the tariff reductions under the Spalma-incentivi Decree
violated the impairment clause (ECT Article 10(1), third sentence), providing that,
“no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.”
Essentially, Claimants contend that the tariff reductions were “unreasonable”
because they contravened various long-term guarantees and assurances by Italy
and were not the outcome of a rational decision-making process that balanced
Italy’s interests with the burdens on investors.°** Instead, the tariff reductions

were the result of “the political whim of a new administration”.*™

421. Furthermore, argue Claimants, a measure’s “reasonableness” must be
interpreted from the investor’s perspective at the time of its decision to invest,
instead of what the state later considered to be reasonable based on policy.>*°
Claimants elaborate further in the Reply, that “the reason must be justified in light
of Italy’s duty to protect investors and encourage investment, as enshrined in the
ECT,.”*° However, in this case, according to Claimants, Italy failed to consider
the financial impact on PV investors.°*”

422. Finally, Claimants argue that the tariff reductions under the Spalma-incentivi
Decree violated the umbrella clause (ECT Article 10(1), fifth sentence), providing
that, “[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into

with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.”
According to Claimants, Italy entered into, but failed to observe, “contractual,
legislative, and regulatory obligations with regard to Claimants and their
investments”.°** Claimants base their broad understanding of the types of
obligations encompassed by the ECT’s umbrella clause on prior ECT awards,
scholarly writing on the ECT, and other (non-ECT) investment treaty decisions.°”
Claimants also assert that the umbrella clause’s breadth is shown by the use of the
word “any” in the phrase “shall observe any obligations”. Referring to this
broad understanding, Claimants contend that the Conto Energia decrees, GSE
letters, and GSE Agreements whereby Italy undertook to pay specific tariff rates
for a twenty-year period constituted obligations subject to the ECT’s umbrella
clause.

423. In response to Respondent’s argument that the phrase, “entered into”, implies
coverage of only contractual obligations, Claimants refer to the writing of an
arbitration practitioner who asserts that the phrase does not exclude commitments
made by legislation or decree, and a dictionary entry defining the phrase as to “to

undertake to bind oneself by (an agreement or other commitment)”.*””

424. Further, Claimants rebut Respondent’s argument that the GSE Agreements are
not the type of contracts falling within the umbrella clause. Claimants essentially
argue that the nature of the GSE Agreements under Italian law is irrelevant, since
the GSE Agreements “are direct evidence of a binding obligation Italy entered into
to pay specified tariff rates to Claimants’ facilities for twenty years.””* Claimants
refer to the first opinion of Professor D’ Atena, their expert on Italian law, stating

that a contract’s nature as “accessory” or otherwise does not prevent it from
imposing binding obligations.**

b. Respondent’s Position

425. According to Respondent, the reasonableness and proportionality of the
Spalma-incentivi Decree are a defense to what would otherwise constitute a
violation of legitimate expectations.

426. Respondent’s view is that the “legitimacy” of an expectation cannot be
determined by considering only the legislative framework when the investor made
its investment, since that would equate to requiring the state to “freeze its own
normative activity”.**° Respondent points to the absence of any “freezing clause”
in Article 10(1) of the ECT.™° Thus, Respondent argues that the meaning of
“legitimate”, as applied to an investor’s expectations, must accord “due relevance
to the sovereign right of States to progress their legislation.”**”

427. Respondent does not, however, take the view that a host state has unlimited
power to change its laws.*“* Instead, while evolution of the law is to be expected,
what is prohibited is a state acting “unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the
exercise of its legislative power.”*””

428. Respondent proceeds by arguing that the Spalma-incentivi Decree did not run
afoul of these restrictions, but merely “reshape[d]” the benefits of the Conto
Energia decrees and was “reasonable, proportionate and consistent with the
overall framework surrounding the Conto Energia Regimes.”*° The Spalma-
incentivi Decree was reasonable, argues Respondent, because it balanced the need
for PV incentives with the need to avoid over-compensating PV investors and the
need to protect consumers from high costs.°*! It was proportionate because the
main structure of the Conto Energia regime was preserved. Investors were

offered multiple options for accepting the amended structure, and it had a “limited
impact on the PV investors.”°>

429. In its Rejoinder, Respondent clarifies its view as to the “reasonableness” of the
Spalma-incentivi Decree: first, Claimants profited “above that fair remuneration
that the system was there to guarantee...”; second, the “re-modulation was
necessary to re-equilibriate the system and equalize it to reduce its excessive
social burden. ..”; and finally, the measure only affected Claimants “to a limited
extent...”

430. In this context, Respondent construes both reasonableness and proportionality
so as to de-emphasize the importance of the losses suffered by Claimants.
Respondent instead sees the relevant question as whether the Spalma-incentivi
Decree was “reasonable and proportionate to [its] aim.”*** Respondent
emphasizes the flexibility allowed the investor in giving it a choice of three
options, arguing that the measure should also have been foreseen by investors due
to the Destinazione Italia Decree.**

431. Respondent also draws a connection between the Salva Alcoa decree, which
extended the period of eligibility for Conto II tariffs, and the alleged
reasonableness and proportionality of the Spalma-incentivi Decree’s tariff
reductions.>°° According to Respondent, Claimants gained an additional EUR 18
million from the Salva Alcoa decree, greater than the amount that they allegedly
lost due to the Spalma-incentivi Decree.*” Respondent argues that even if it is
acknowledged that Claimants suffered damages due to unpredictable regulatory
changes under the Spalma-incentivi Decree, the benefits Claimants received due to
the “equally unexpected extension of the second Energy Account” should also be
considered.”***

432. Ina further line of argument, Respondent states that the Conto Energia
decrees were not to be taken as strictly unchangeable, given the wider context of
Italian “primary” legislation, including Legislative Decree no. 387/2003,

Legislative Decree no. 28/2011, and the EU directives.>” As Respondent
mentions, Article 7(2)(d) of Legislative Decree no. 387/2003 required that the
incentive tariffs be fixed so as to “ensure an equitable remuneration of the costs of
investment and operation”™™ Furthermore, Respondent contends that the Conto
Energia decrees are not “autonomous primary legislative sources, but secondary
regulations” and “find their own validity, limits and interpretative criteria ...
within the primary sources on which they are based.”*°' Respondent asserts,
moreover, that the Italian Constitutional Court confirmed these points in a
decision allegedly affirming the Spalma-incentivi Decree’s validity.*

433. Next, Respondent counters Claimants’ arguments based on consistency and
transparency, good faith, the impairment clause, and the umbrella clause, as
briefly summarized below.

434. With respect to the standards of consistency and transparency which
Claimants assert are related under the FET standard, Respondent submits that the
arbitral jurisprudence cited by Claimants does not support the existence of an
autonomous duty of consistency or of a duty of consistency deriving from the
transparency obligation. Although Respondent denies there is an autonomous
duty of consistency under the FET standard, Respondent acknowledges that
“consistency may have a certain relevance” in the assessment of the legitimacy of
a host state’s conduct in regard to investors’ expectations.*™ With respect to
transparency, on the other hand, Respondent asserts that Claimants’ actual
arguments for breach of the transparency standard effectively reduce to legitimate
expectations arguments, allegedly raising doubt as to an autonomous duty of

transparency.*°>

435. As for the duty to act in good faith, Respondent asserts that Claimants’
arguments simply reproduce their arguments alleging a violation of legitimate
expectations.*° Respondent, in turn, points back to its assertions from the
legitimate expectations context, to the effect that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was
reasonable in light of the legitimate policy goal of maintaining a sustainable

faith” must entail “bad faith

436. In rebuttal to Claimants’ impairment clause argument, Respondent asserts
there the impairment clause has “substantial overlap” with the FET standard, and
that Claimants’ impairment clause argument is substantially the same as their
legitimate expectations argument.°° Further, Respondent submits that the
meaning of the phrase, “impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures”,
differs from that suggested by Claimants. According to Respondent, the notion of
“impair” requires a “significant” impairment, a higher degree than “any negative
impact or effect”, as Claimants submit is required.”

437. According to Respondent’s interpretation of an “unreasonable” measure, “at
the core of the assessment of reasonableness lies the regulatory power of the State
and its correct exercise in relation to a matter of public interest.”*”' Respondent
proposes to apply the two-part notion of an “unreasonable” measure described in
the AES v. Hungary case.5” According to this notion, first, the tribunal would
consider whether there is a “rational policy” in the sense of a policy “taken by a
state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim or addressing a
public interest matter”.°”? Second, the question is whether there is a “appropriate
correlation” between the measure and the policy such that the State’s act is
“reasonable”.>”4 Respondent concludes its rebuttal by referring back to the
justifications offered in the FET context, in particular, the “overall framework of
PV Italian and EU legislation”.*”°

438. Respondent does not directly address whether it views the reasonableness
inquiry as including consideration of a party’s expectations. In response to
Claimants’ assertion that “Italy ignores the legal analysis that requires the question
of reasonableness to be measured against the expectations of the parties to the

broad argumentation as for the issue of legitimate expectations.””””

439. As to whether the Spalma-incentivi Decree was discriminatory, as Claimants
submit in their Reply, because “it only applied to PV investors while Italy
maintained or increased support to other renewable energy and traditional energy
providers”,°”* Respondent contends that the question of discriminatory treatment
would require comparison of the development of PV production and technology
with other renewable energy sources.°”? According to Respondent, PV energy
faced different circumstances, and thus required its own system of economic
incentives.

440. Regarding the umbrella clause, Respondent makes a number of arguments in
support of its position that “obligations” cannot be understood to include statutory
or regulatory obligations, but only contractual obligations.**! According to
Respondent, arbitral tribunals have not generally accepted the inclusion of
statutory or regulatory obligations under the umbrella clause, highlighting the A/-
Bahloul case. Respondent takes the view that the Conto Energia decrees were
general and did not target any specific type of investors.**

441. Respondent focuses also on the umbrella clause’s literal interpretation,
asserting that the words “entered into” refer only to contractual obligations.° S4
Had regulatory commitments been intended, Respondent suggests the drafters
might have used the phrase, “any obligations owed to an Investor”.*** Respondent
submits, additionally, that “entered into with” implies an activity of negotiation
between two parties, since “entered into” is followed by “with”.°*° Beyond a
literal interpretation, Respondent makes contextual arguments as well, asserting
inter alia that since the FET clause already addresses legislative obligations, it
would be duplicative for the umbrella clause also to cover those obligations.**”

Instead, says Italy, the FET and umbrella clause should be understood to “deal
respectively with two different kinds of state obligations (regulatory and
contractual).”°** Thus, according to Respondent, the Conto Energia decrees do
not constitute relevant obligations under the umbrella clause.

442. Respondent next argues that the GSE Agreements are a special type of
contract that is not covered by the umbrella clause. According to Respondent, the
umbrella clause is intended to cover contracts negotiated with a foreign investor
that are not otherwise covered by an investment treaty and which the umbrella
clause is intended to “‘internationalize” for the investor’s protection.” The GSE
Agreements, on the other hand, are asserted to be “merely accessory contracts
(‘contratti accessori’ or ‘accessivi’), which simply transpose legal provisions”
that originate in the Conto Energia decrees.” In its Rejoinder, Respondent calls
attention to the 7 December 2016 Italian Constitutional Court decision, which
allegedly confirmed the “accessory” nature of the GSE Agreements, and stated as
follows:

[T]he agreements entered into with the GSE cannot be interpreted as
contracts intended for the exclusive benefit of the operator — which
should be entitled to see initial conditions unchanged, for twenty
years, even if the technological conditions deeply mutate -, but
constitute instruments of regulation, aimed at achieving the objective
of incentivization of certain energy sources in balance with other
sources of renewable energy, as well as with minimal sacrifice for
users, who also bear its economic burden.”

443. In its Rejoinder, Respondent submits, in response to Claimants’ contention
that a GSE Agreement is binding regardless of what type of contract it is:

[R]ules are binding under the contract, but the public power may
unilaterally modify its conditions by modifying the authoritative act it
complements. Consequently, for what of relevance here, the contract
itself cannot give rise to autonomous obligations as for matters such
as maintenance of fixed tariffs.””*

444. Finally, in the alternative, Respondent argues that even if the GSE Agreements
are found to be covered by umbrella clause, Claimants have not proved that they

were breached. According to Respondent, Claimants do not assert a direct
violation of those contracts by the GSE, which was party to the contracts.°??
Instead, says Respondent, Claimants are effectively challenging regulatory acts by
Italy, which was not a party to the contracts and had no obligations thereunder.°™*
Respondent also asserts that the Salva-Alcoa decree should be taken into account
in determining whether Italy fulfilled its obligations regarding fixed tariff rates,
submitting that the Salva-Alcoa decree was to Claimants’ benefit.*”°

ce. Tribunal Analysis

445. Article 10(1) of the ECT begins with a duty for each contracting state to
encourage “stable, equitable, favourable and transparent” conditions for investors
to make investments, and then provides as follows:

Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to
Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and
equitable treatment.°”°

446. With respect to legitimate expectations, a majority of the Tribunal concludes
that Claimants have put forward the more persuasive position.

447. At the time of investing, Claimants had been led to believe, reasonably, that
the incentive tariffs would remain the same as promised in the Conto Energia
decrees, GSE letters and GSE Agreements throughout a twenty-year period.

448. Respondent has not provided any persuasive reason to conclude that despite
entitlement to the incentive tariffs, an investor, when making the investment,
should not expect the tariffs to remain constant. While the investor might need to
live with some minor adjustments, nothing alerted the Claimants that they would
need to accept changes of the magnitude imposed by the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

449. When Claimants invested in the PV facilities, they received assurances which
were not subject to any reservation of a discretion to change the rate of return as
effected by the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

450. While Italy submitted that its “right to regulate” must be balanced against the
need to protect investors’ legitimate expectations,” such arguments appear to

5 Rejoinder, {{f 389-392.

596 ECT, Art. 10(1) (first and second sentences).

135

miss the point in this context. The repeated and precise assurances to specific
investors amounted to guarantees that the tariffs would remain fixed for two
decades. Italy effectively waived its right to reduce the value of the tariffs.

451. The better view must be that Italy’s assurances constituted non-waivable
guarantees. The majority of the Tribunal does not deny that Italy faced “a
situation of economic difficulty”, as Professor Sacerdoti writes in his dissenting
opinion. However, none of the circumstances evidenced in this case reach the
level of force majeure. The right of Respondent to change the tariffs does not
arise under the present circumstances, given that the justification for changes
relate simply to alleged compensation to the service provider and the marginal
cost to consumers.

452. Host states certainly retain the sovereign prerogative to amend their laws.
However, if the state gives an investor express assurances that no amendment
would occur, the investor must be fairly compensated if those assurances are
violated. By way of example, in Total v. Argentina, the tribunal appears to have
denied that balancing was relevant where the state had purported to make
contractual, bilateral or similar undertakings, which were “binding in [their] own
right” Further, in the Parkerings case, the tribunal found that the host State’s
right to amend the law is limited when there is an “agreement, in the form of a
stabilization clause or otherwise”.°°? Claimants refer to these cases in their Reply
and, as mentioned above, Respondent approvingly cites to the standard described
in Parkerings.°°

453. Given the specificity of the assurances Italy offered (Conto Energia decrees,
statements and conduct of Italian officials, and individual GSE letters and GSE
Agreements), those assurances bear the hallmarks of (borrowing the Parkerings
tribunal’s language) “an agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause or
otherwise.” Italy thus crossed a threshold such that the reduction of the incentive
tariffs by the Spalma-incentivi Decree defeated Claimants’ legitimate
expectations. The majority of the Tribunal notes that while some of Italy’s
specific assurances remain relevant to both the present analysis and the umbrella
clause, analyzed separately below, such assurances play a different role in relation
to the standards under fair and equitable treatment and under the umbrella clause.
Professor Sacerdoti in his dissenting opinion expresses the view that with respect
to the FET standard, Italy did not undertake any “obligation” to refrain from

modifying the Conto Energia regime. In contrast, the majority considers that the
combined weight of the evidence shows that Italy did indeed undertake such
obligations, relevant to the first two sentences of ECT Article 10(1). In this
connection, Italy gave assurances giving rise to legitimate expectations on the part
of Claimants, and did so irrespective of any other duties in regard to the umbrella
clause.

454. Moreover, a balancing of the regulatory right against the host state’s
assurances implicates a reasonable and valid policy justification for the changes.
The primary justification Italy has offered for reducing the tariffs refers to the
electricity costs to consumers, including households.*! However, the decree
expressly stated that it was “intended to reduce electricity rates for customers of
medium voltage and low voltage electricity with more than 16.5 kW power
available, other than residential customers and public lighting.” Further,
Claimants pointed to data showing that electricity costs to consumers have
decreased approximately 2-4% as a result of the Spalma-incentivi Decree. A
majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s alleged justifications
for the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

455. In sum, a majority of the Tribunal finds that the Spalma-incentivi Decree
undermined Claimants’ legitimate expectations and therefore violated the FET
clause.

456. Given Claimants’ success on the merits of their legitimate expectations claim
in regard to the incentive tariff reduction, no additional damages can be derived by
proving a breach of the other FET sub-standards (namely, consistency and
transparency, and good faith) or, similarly, the impairment clause and umbrella
clause. Nevertheless, for the sake of providing a fuller analysis of the reasoning of
a majority of the Tribunal, the following brief observations can be made with
respect to each standard.

457. With respect to the duty to provide transparent and consistent conditions for
investments, under ECT Article 10(1), a majority of the Tribunal would find that
Italy violated these obligations by enacting the incentive tariff reduction under the
Spalma-incentivi Decree. In doing so, it is unnecessary to delve into whether

! Statement of Defense, 508 (Claimants assert that “...the Spalma-incentivi Decree is one of a package of
measures to reduce the energy costs for SMEs and households. Such a target was considered by the Italian
Government to be necessary for the competitiveness of (in particular, micro and small size) enterprises and to
help families in an especially difficult economic context. The overall estimated saving of these measures is of
2.7 million euros, 1.7 of which to the benefit of SMEs”).

137

these notions constitute obligations that are “autonomous” from the broader FET
standard, as to which Respondent expressed doubt. Respondent acknowledged
that “consistency may have a certain relevance” to the legitimate expectations
inquiry and that Claimants’ argument for violation of the “transparency” standard
largely echoes their legitimate expectations argument. Importantly, a duty of
“transparency” is expressly required by Article 10(1) (first sentence), providing:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area.

458. A majority of the Tribunal considers that the tariff modifications effected by
the Spalma-incentivi Decree could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time
of Claimants’ investments, made in reliance on the framework of fixed tariffs for
twenty years set forth in the Conto Energia decrees, GSE Agreements, and GSE
letters. A majority of the Tribunal would thus find that the Spalma-incentivi
Decree constituted a failure by Respondent to “encourage and create ...
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties...”

459. Regarding the principle of good faith, both sides concur that, in some sense,
good faith is closely linked to, or underlies, the FET standard.* They apparently
differ, however, on the meaning of this principle, particularly on whether a
violation would require evidence of “bad faith”. Respondent contends that bad
faith is implicated by the “autonomous” notion of the good faith principle that
Respondent ascribes to Claimants.°° Claimants, on the other hand, assert that bad
faith is not required.” Claimants do state, however, that good faith means
“honesty” or a “sincere intention to deal fairly with others”, referring to an
American legal encyclopedia.*

460. With this interpretative question as a backdrop, Claimants argue that Italy
breached the principle of good faith, allegedly, by (i) deciding to retain the
benefits of Claimants’ PV investments, while denying Claimants the benefits
promised to them; (ii) modifying the incentives after Claimants had “sunk” costs
by investing in PV facilities, knowing that the investors were “trapped” in Italy;

and (iii) disingenuously proclaiming that the policy reasons behind the Spalma-
incentivi Decree were to reduce costs to consumers and thus assure the
sustainability of the incentives programs.” According to Claimants’
interpretation of good faith as “honesty” and a “sincere intention to deal fairly
with others”, a lack of good faith would logically mean dishonesty and insincere
intentions, whether or not it implies “bad faith”, as Claimants deny. The Tribunal
does not, however, find evidence to conclude that Italy’s decision to issue the
Spalma-incentivi Decree involved dishonesty or insincerity, nor does the Tribunal
consider that there is evidence to impute bad faith to Italy. Thus, according to
either side’s interpretation of the principle of good faith, the Tribunal does not
consider that the Spalma-incentivi Decree violated the good faith principle based
upon the evidence presented.

461. Both sides appear to have a different appreciation of the impairment clause, in
several respects. First, on the degree of impairment required for a successful
claim, Respondent submits that the impairment must be “significant”, rather than
merely “any negative impact or effect”.©'° A majority of the Tribunal notes,
however, that the third sentence of ECT Article 10(1) provides, “no Contracting
Party shall in any way impair...” (emphasis added). Had the drafters not included
the words “in any way” in the clause, a majority of the Tribunal might be
persuaded to agree with Respondent’s interpretation. In any event, it is not
necessary to take a position on this matter of interpretation, given that the negative
impact of the tariff reduction on Claimants’ investments is, in the Tribunal
majority’s view, significant in terms of the quantum of damages attributable to the
measure.

462. Second, the interpretation of “unreasonable... measures” is interpreted
differently by Claimants and Respondent. Respondent’s position, essentially, is
that a measure is not “unreasonable”, provided that there exists a rational public
purpose for the measure, combined with a reasonable manner of effecting that
purpose. Claimants, on the other hand, insist that the inquiry should be more
inclusive, considering the perspective of the treaty parties or the investor, as to
whether a measure is reasonable. The Tribunal majority, in line with its
conclusion on legitimate expectations, is inclined to agree that the interests of
investors must be considered in determining whether a measure is reasonable. In
light of that interpretation, a majority of the Tribunal concludes that the tariff
reduction was an “unreasonable measure” that impaired Claimants’ investments.
Accordingly, the Tribunal majority finds that the tariff reduction under the
Spalma-incentivi Decree breached the ECT’s impairment clause. The Tribunal
majority considers, on the other hand, that Claimants have not adequately proved

© Statement of Claim, [ff 368-369.
6! Statement of Defense, | 718; Rejoinder, {| 345.

139

that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was a discriminatory measure that
disproportionately affected PV producers.

463. Inhis dissenting opinion, Professor Sacerdoti expresses that the word
“impairment” itself implies both a quantitative and qualitative aspect that
undermines the “legal security” of an investment. The Tribunal majority does not,
however, concur with its esteemed colleague in this regard. As a matter of
interpretation of ECT Article 10(1) (third sentence), which refers to the
impairment of the “management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of
investments, a negative impact on an investment’s legal security is not necessarily
implicated by a breach of the impairment clause. It is sufficient to find that an
investment’s “enjoyment” or “disposal” would be in some way impaired by a 6-
8% reduction in value, without the investment’s legal standing or security
necessarily being undermined.

464. With respect to Claimants’ umbrella clause claim, a majority of the Tribunal
finds that the incentive tariff reduction under the Spalma-incentivi Decree
involved a failure by Italy to observe its obligations to Claimants and to their
investments. After reflecting on the arguments of both sides, the Tribunal
majority is inclined to interpret “obligations” referred to in the ECT’s umbrella
clause as sufficiently broad to encompass not only contractual duties but also
certain legislative and regulatory instruments that are specific enough to qualify as
commitments to identifiable investments or investors.

  

465. Respondent has admitted that the GSE Agreements themselves constitute
binding obligations, although they may be unilaterally modified by legislative or
regulatory action of the Italian government. However, even to the extent the GSE
Agreements may be deemed mere “accessory contracts” that mirror the underlying
regulations set forth in the Conto Energia decrees, the GSE Agreements must not
be viewed in isolation from the GSE authorization letters and Conto Energia
decrees.

466. The Tribunal majority instead finds that, taken as a whole, the Conto Energia
decrees, the GSE letters, and the GSE Agreements, amounted to obligations
“entered into with” specific PV operators. Those obligations were sufficiently
specific, setting forth specific tariff rates for a fixed duration of twenty years.
Accordingly, whether any of the Conto Energia decrees, GSE letters, or GSE
Agreements would, in isolation, be covered by the ECT’s umbrella clause is not
the relevant question here, given that each of Claimants’ investments received
benefits pursuant to all three types of “obligations”.

140

467. The majority of the Tribunal notes the distinction drawn by Professor
Sacerdoti in his enting opinion between GSE Agreements that were originally
entered into with foreign-owned PV operators and GSE Agreements that were
originally entered into with Italian-owned PV operators that only later became
owned by a foreign investor, namely Claimants. According to Professor
Sacerdoti, the latter category of PV operators would not be covered by the ECT’s
umbrella clause. This is because, in his view, the words “entered into with an
Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party” entails
that an investor or investment must have been, respectively, from another
Contracting Party or owned by an investor from another Contracting Party at the
specific time when the obligation was “entered into”. The majority of the Tribunal
observes that this distinction was not raised by either side in this arbitration, nor
would it facilitate a correct understanding of the umbrella clause. In the
majority’s view, this distinction is incompatible with an appropriately broad
interpretation of the umbrella clause aimed at ensuring adequate protection of
foreign investors. There is, moreover, no hint of such a temporal dimension in the
plain wording of the ECT’s umbrella clause.

 

2. Payment Term Change under the Spalma-incentivi Decree

a. Claimants’ Position

468. Claimants assert that as a result of the modified incentive tariff payment
scheme under Article 26(2) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree, the 10% adjustment
payments would not be received until at least four months, and as much as fifteen
months, later than those amounts would have been paid under the original Conto
Energia regime.°!! According to Claimants, these delays reduced their cash
flows.°'? Claimants’ counsel stated at the hearing that the “change in the timing of
the receipt of the payments ... had a harmful effect.”°"°.

°"! Expert Report of Richard Edwards, 4 April 2016, J 3.26 n. 54 (“Payment relating to electricity generated in
January would have been due at the end of March, but instead will be paid at the end of June fifteen months
later. Payment relating to December would usually have been paid at the end of the following February, but
instead will be paid at the end of June four months later.”). See also Second Expert Report of Richard
Edwards, 15 December 2016, § 5.46 (“My understanding of the IT Payment Term Change is that 10% of the
Incentive Tariff revenue is now settled at the end of June of the following calendar year (i.e. between 6 and 17
months after the period to which it relates), rather than two months after as is the case for the remaining 90%
of the revenue and as was the case for 100% of the revenue before the change.”).

469. In response to Respondent’s quantum experts, Claimants’ quantum expert
asserts that this measure “‘constitute[s] a deterioration in payment terms” and does

not “introduce any improvements to payment terms”.°!*

b. Respondent’s Position

470. Respondent asserts that the purpose of Article 26(2) of the Spalma-incentivi
Decree was to avoid making incorrect payments to producers, including both
overpayments and underpayments.°!> Also, according to Respondent, the measure
provided other “improvements and benefits to the operators”, including
“substantial correspondence between advance payment and actual output”, a
“reduction in the number of rectification[s]”, and “stability of financial flows”.°!°

471. In terms of its benefit to Italy, Respondent asserts that this measure also
yielded an “[e]stimated savings of EUR 600 million one-off year 2015....”°"7

472. Respondent also asserts that the harmful effects on Claimants are minimal:

[T]he possible postponement of the payment of the incentive up to
the adjustment time has an effect on the cash flows of the
manufacturer only in the first year of the mechanism, as in the
following years both the advance of the current year and the
adjustment of the previous year will be paid.°'

473. According to Respondent’s quantum experts, this measure represents “a
normal fine-tuning that inevitably occur[s] in prolonged and dynamic
relationship” and “completely lacks of materiality”.°' They also assert that “the
average payment terms for PV plants with a nominal capacity not lower than 20
kW appears to be improved, instead of getting worse.”””

474. In Claimants’ substantive arguments regarding the Spalma-incentivi Decree,
Claimants focus on changes to the duration and amount of tariffs pursuant to
Options A, B and C under Article 26(3) thereof. Their legal arguments — under
FET, the impairment clause, and the umbrella clause — do not address how the
change in payment terms under Article 26(2) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree and
its implementing regulation would violate those standards. On the other hand, as
one of eight “Principal Regulatory Changes” repeatedly listed by Claimants and
their quantum expert, Claimants clearly imply that the payment term change,
whether alone or in combination with other measures, violated one or more of.
those treaty standards. This is evident from statements in Claimants’ written
submissions, reports and oral testimony by their quantum expert, and remarks of
counsel and presentation slides displayed at the hearing.

475. Respondent, in turn, has raised various arguments in defense of the payment
term change, asserting, inter alia, that it was a “fine-tuning” measure that reduced
inaccuracies and improved efficiency in disbursement of tariff adjustments,
resulted in cost savings for Italy, and had only a minimal negative impact on (and
in some instances improved) Claimants’ cash flows. Respondent and its experts
assert there is no legal basis for relief relating to this measure.

476. Although the payment term change measure receives much more oblique
treatment by the Parties than the other seven measures, it nonetheless comes
before the Tribunal to decide and is not disposed of by the Tribunal’s other
conclusions regarding other measures.

477. Given Claimants’ failure to provide any clear argument as to why the payment
term change might have breached the ECT or international law, the Tribunal finds
that there is no basis to grant relief for the losses allegedly resulting from it. In
passing, the Tribunal notes that Claimants did not allege, let alone prove, that
organs of the Italian Republic offered explicit or implicit promises or guarantees
that changes of the type encompassed by the payment term change would not be
made. Thus, even though Claimants considered this measure unfavorable to their
investments, Claimants have not argued or alleged any ground for a legitimate
expectations claim. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal therefore denies
Claimants’ request for relief in relation to Article 26(2) of the Spalma-incentivi
Decree.

3. Modification of Minimum Guaranteed Price Scheme

a. Claimants’ Position

143

478. Claimants allege they were harmed by a drastic modification of the MGP
Scheme beginning from 2014. They allege that from 2008 through 2013, PV
plants with a capacity less than 1 MW had received minimum guaranteed prices
ranging from EUR 72.2 per MWh to EUR 105.8 per MWh, which increased, on
average, every year. However, from 2014 onward, Italy set the minimum
guaranteed price at EUR 38.9 per MWh and excluded plants over 100 kW in
capacity and plants benefitting from the Conto Energia incentive tariffs.©?

479. Claimants assert that under the amended MGP Scheme, all of NovEnergia’s
plants that previously benefitted from the MGP Scheme became ineligible for the
program.°” Further, they assert that 12 of the 80 plants of Greentech that
benefitted from the MGP Scheme became ineligible for the program.°**

480. As summarized below, Claimants assert violations of several standards falling
under the FET clause, including the legitimate expectations, transparency and
consistency, and good faith standards. Claimants additionally assert violations of
the impairment clause and umbrella clause.

481. Claimants assert that they formed legitimate expectations that Italy would
ensure the economic survival, regardless of market conditions, of PV plants under
1 MW in capacity, which had relatively high operating costs, and would pay a
certain remuneration under the MGP Scheme to ensure their profitability.°”
Claimants state the following grounds for their expectations:

Italy’s goal of protecting PV facilities under 1 MW was reflected in legislative
and regulatory acts, including AEEG Resolution no. 280/2007.°°

From 2008 through 2013, the AEEG established minimum guaranteed prices
ranging from EUR 72 to EUR 106 per MWh of electricity produced, suggesting a
“six-year-long course of dealing by Italy” offering rates well above market
rates.”

adjustment for inflation.°°*

e Each eligible PV facility had a contract with the GSE providing for prices to be
set each year to ensure facilities’ survival “even in case the market price were to
fall significantly.”

482. Claimants assert that Italy’s modifications to the MGP Scheme, pursuant to
AEEG Resolution 618 of 19 December 2013 and the Destinazione Italia law
decree issued on 23 December 2013, defeated their legitimate expectations,
breaching the FET clause.°°

483. Claimants also assert that Italy engaged in inconsistent and non-transparent
treatment in two ways, breaching the FET clause. First, claimants argue, the six-
year course of dealing in which Italy provided minimum guaranteed prices in the
range of EUR 72 to EUR 106 per MWh (above the market price) was followed by
a sharp reduction to a below-market price of EUR 38.9 for 2014.°! Second,
purporting to show an inconsistency between two governmental bodies, Claimants
assert that the AEEG set prices for 2014 at a below-market rate, then the Italian
government enacted a law eliminating minimum guaranteed prices for PV
facilities receiving Conto tariffs.°

484. As for the good faith standard under FET, Claimants assert that although Italy
was aware of the need to ensure survival of small PV plants, it nonetheless
“substantially and arbitrarily reduced the prices and then effectively ended the
regime for Claimants and other investors.”°*

485. Next, Claimants assert that the “many assurances and commitments Italy had
provided” previously regarding minimum guaranteed prices and the consistent six-
year course of dealing made it unreasonable to reduce and then essentially end
access to those prices. This, Claimants argue, violates the impairment clause.°™

486. Finally, Claimants argue that Italy breached the ECT’s umbrella clause by
promising — in law, regulation, and contract — to support small PV facilities and

shield them from market changes.°*> The contracts were subject to automatic
renewal each year and should have reflected increased prices each year.
Further, Claimants assert that Italy breached its obligations by reducing the prices
to only 60% of the market price and eliminating the possibility for most plants
(including Claimants’ plants) to participate in the off-take regime.*”

487. In response to Italy’s argument that the modifications were justified by the
reduced operating costs of smaller PV facilities in the years leading up to 2013,
Claimants assert that the data that Italy relied upon — namely, a 2013 report from
Politecnico di Milano — was incomplete and unclear.°** According to Claimants’
regulatory experts,

Overall, it is not possible to determine a general decreasing trend in
operating costs, as the data points provided by Politecnico for
different years are for different plant sizes and thus not directly
comparable. Further, given that the goal of this exercise was to assess
operating cost trends, a relatively small sample size (of 16 plants if
the data points represent individual plants) would not be likely to
yield results that would be broadly applicable to all plants under 1
Mw.22

488. Additionally, Claimants assert that the methodology used by the Politecnico’s
report only covers a portion of the real operational costs of the Claimants’ PV
facilities, failing to include costs of land rent, various professional service fees,
agency fees, imbalance costs, administrative fees, and the Robin Hood tax.
Claimants further argue that the minimum guaranteed prices established by Italy
for 2014 would not cover the only plants that remained eligible for the MGP
Scheme, and accordingly, the modified scheme lacked any rational basis."

489. Claimants also rebut Respondent’s assertion” that a reduction in operating
costs justified the decision to limit eligibility for the MGP Scheme to plants under
100 kW and not benefiting from the Conto Energia incentives.“ Claimants
assert that the lower capacity threshold was an arbitrary restriction that was not
justified by the operating costs data, and that the inability to participate in both

forms of incentives deprived the MGP Scheme of any ability to fulfil its purpose
of ensuring the survival of small PV plants, since the minimum guaranteed prices
were not sufficient to cover operating costs.“

b. Respondent’s Position

490. Respondent contends that Claimants lacked any basis to form legitimate
expectations regarding either the amount of the minimum prices under the MGP
Scheme or their availability over time. Respondent asserts that, on the contrary,
Italy made “no affirmation regarding the duration or the amount of the favourable
regime of minimum prices....”°°

491. Asa preliminary point, Respondent argues that the primary legislation
establishing the off-take regime, Legislative Decree 387/03 and Law 39/2004,
does not provide specific assurances regarding prices or their duration. Instead,
Respondent asserts that this legislation merely delegated to the AEEG the power
to establish such regulations.©” According to Respondent, since the AEEG sets
minimum prices annually, without any range or limits provided in AEEG
Resolution no. 280/2007, this is “per se sufficient to exclude any expectation” as
to how such power is exercised.“

492. Next, Respondent makes three rebuttals to Claimants’ arguments regarding
alleged legitimate expectations of maintaining prices. First, referring to the
Preamble of AEEG Resolution no. 280/2007, stating an objective “to ensure the
economic survival of smaller plants, even in case the market prices were to fall
significantly”, Respondent asserts that the wording does not support an
expectation of profitability, but merely survival of PV plants.“

493. Second, Respondent contends that the six-year trend of high minimum prices
from 2008 to 2013 could not create an expectation that those prices would be
maintained. Respondent asserts that Claimants made their investments in the
2008-2010 time frame, which would not be a sufficient amount of time to assert
their reliance on such a trend and, in any case, most of the trend occurred after

Claimants made their investments, so it could not inform their expectations.°°
Respondent argues that if the AEEG’s power to set prices was limited to following
such a trend, those limits would have been provided by law.°*! Respondent also
quotes from a provision of Annex A to Resolution no. 280/2007 as a foundation
for its assertion that it was never ruled out that prices might be set below the

2013 were known to be temporary.

494. Third, Respondent asserts that when Claimants made their investments, there
was no assurance as to an inflation adjustment of the minimum prices. Although
there was an inflation adjustment under AEEG Resolution 34/2005, Respondent
asserts that the 2007 AEEG Resolution replaced this by giving the AEEG power
to set a yearly determination of prices, which was the status when Claimants
began their investments.°*

495. Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants lacked any legitimate expectation
that PV plants would be eligible to receive both the minimum guaranteed prices
and Conto Energia incentives. Respondent asserts that there is no basis to infer
that both benefits would be offered merely because they were offered
cumulatively in the past.°°

496. Asanext step, Respondent argues that even if, for the sake of argument,
Claimants had formed legitimate expectations, these were not undermined by
Italy’s measures with respect to the level of minimum prices. Respondent begins
with Resolution 618 of 2013, which set the 2014 minimum prices lower than
before, arguing that the measure was reasonable and consistent with the purpose
of the MGP Scheme.®° Since the off-take regime under AEEG Resolution no.
280/2007 sought, according to Respondent, to “ensure the economic survival of
smaller plants”, the assurance of a basic remuneration covering operational costs
under Resolution 618 of 2013 was consistent with this purpose.°*’ Respondent

also contends that Resolution 618 of 2013 complied with the broader legal
framework, requiring merely that the AEEG exercise power by “making reference
to” market conditions, which Respondent asserts the AEEG did.°* The broader
legal framework did not, according to Respondent, imply that minimum prices
must remain stable over time.°”

497. Respondent next turns to Law Decree 145/2013, which allegedly reduced the
possibility for PV plants to obtain both incentive tariffs and minimum prices.
Respondent asserts that the decision was made reasonably, based on the sharply
decreasing operational costs and increasing costs to consumers, and did not
conflict with any relevant rule. Respondent argues that the purpose of
protecting “smaller plants” enunciated in Resolution no. 280/2007 was preserved
by the 2013 law, since plants under 100 kWh retained the benefits of both
incentive measures.

498. With respect to Claimants’ allegations that modifications of the MGP Scheme
breached the FET clause’s consistency and transparency standard and good faith
standard, Respondent reiterates its position that those claims do not constitute
autonomous standards under the FET clause. For the sake of argument, however,
Respondent asserts that the 2013 modifications were consistent with the primary
legislation establishing the off-take regime and prior AEEG resolutions and
therefore were not arbitrary. Respondent also rebuts Claimants’ assertion that it
violated the impairment clause, referring to its prior arguments in defense of FET
claims.

499. In response to Claimants’ allegation that the changes to the MGP Scheme
were drastic and unexpected, Respondent asserts that the changes legislated at the
end of 2013 were the result of a long analysis and consultation period dating back
to 2011.5 Respondent defends the report of the Politecnico di Milano and the
process by which it was prepared, in which data was provided by the market
participants themselves.

ce. Tribunal Analysis

500. A majority of the Tribunal finds that modification of the MGP Scheme did not
violate Article 10(1) of the ECT, namely, the FET’s legitimate expectations,
consistency/transparency and good faith standards, the impairment clause, or the
umbrella clause.

501. Regarding the claim based on legitimate expectations, a majority of the
Tribunal has not been persuaded that Claimants formed such expectations that,
after 2013, they would continue to receive minimum prices at levels similar to
those which they received from 2008 to 2013. In the view of a majority of the
Tribunal, it was not demonstrated that Italy made any explicit or implicit
assurance that would warrant such expectations. Nor, in the majority’s view,
could the Preamble to Resolution no. 280 of 2007, mentioning prices “to ensure
the economic survival of smaller plants, even in case the market prices were to fall
significantly”, without more, suffice to engender legitimate expectations, given
that the power to set prices annually remained with the AEEG.

502. As for the second aspect of Claimants’ legitimate expectations argument,
concerning the limitation on PV plants eligible to receive minimum guaranteed
prices and the decision to restrict most plants from obtaining both the Conto
Energia tariffs and the minimum prices, a majority of the Tribunal also finds that
legitimate expectations were not formed. In the view of a majority of the
Tribunal, a position need not be taken on whether the stated purpose of the MGP
Scheme was undermined by the restrictions Italy put into effect in 2014, since the
Tribunal majority is not persuaded that limiting the number of plants eligible for
the MGP Scheme, in the absence of assurances that a wider applicability would be
maintained, contravenes any legitimate expectations of Claimants. Accordingly,
the Tribunal finds, by a majority, that Italy’s modifications of the MGP Scheme,
under AEEG Resolution 618 of 19 December 2013 and the Destinazione Italia
law decree issued on 23 December 2013, did not constitute breaches of legitimate
expectations.

503. Next, with respect to Claimants’ assertion that Italy sharply reduced the
minimum prices under the MGP Scheme after 2013, and that the AEEG’s and
Italian government’s respective decrees at that time were inconsistent, a majority
of the Tribunal finds that these measures did not involve inconsistent and non-
transparent treatment violating the FET clause. In so finding, the Tribunal
majority notes that the AEEG had requested a report from the Politecnico di
Milano, issued in July 2013, and a consultation document was issued later in
2013, of which Claimants did not deny they were aware. There is no evidence
that investors were treated inconsistently, or that the laws were opaque or

150

arbitrary, notwithstanding a change in the regulations occurring toward the end of
2013 and the beginning of 2014. Also, in the view of a majority of the Tribunal,
given that the Destinazione Italia law decree narrowed the scope of eligible PV
plants, this was rather more consistent than inconsistent with the reduced
minimum guaranteed prices announced four days earlier under AEEG Resolution
618 of 19 December 2013.

504. As for an alleged violation of the good faith standard under FET, a majority of
the Tribunal notes that Italy undertook a consultation process and procured the
Politecnico di Milano’s report prior to modifying the MGP Scheme. In the
majority’s view, Claimants have given no evidence that these modifications were
done “arbitrarily”, as they assert. Accordingly, a majority of the Tribunal finds
that there was not a breach of the good faith standard constituting a breach of the
FET clause.

505. Regarding Claimants’ assertion of a breach of the impairment clause, for the
same reasons noted above with respect to FET, a majority of the Tribunal finds
that reducing the minimum prices and excluding plants above 1 KWh was not an
unreasonable or discriminatory measure with respect to Claimants’ investment.

506. Finally, a majority of the Tribunal finds that modifications to the MGP
Scheme did not breach the umbrella clause. In the majority’s view, even if Italy
had incurred an obligation — through law, regulation, or contract — to support small
PV facilities and protect them from market changes, that obligation was of a
general nature not taking the form of a guarantee not to modify the regulations
governing the MGP Scheme. Claimants did not contest that the MGP Scheme
regulations and contracts were subject to the AEEG’s power to set prices with
reference to market conditions. Given that a consultative process was undertaken
and market data were considered, even if those actions were insufficiently
thorough in Claimants’ view, a majority of the Tribunal is unable to find that the
rather vague obligations to which Italy might have been subject were violated.
Further, there was no guarantee that contracts would be renewed or that the terms
of renewed contracts would be the same as those of prior contracts. Accordingly,
the Tribunal, by a majority, denies Claimants’ umbrella clause claim with respect
to minimum guaranteed prices.

4. Cancellation of ISTAT Inflation Adjustment

a. Claimants’ Position

507. Claimants assert that Respondent’s treatment of the ISTAT inflation
adjustments for tariff premiums under Conto I violated Claimants’ legitimate

151

expectations, displayed inconsistency and lack of transparency, and constituted
bad faith, thus infringing the ECT’s FET clause.® Additionally, they assert that
the measure violated the ECT’s impairment clause and umbrella clause.”

508. Claimants contend that when they started investing in the Italian PV sector,
Italy viewed the 2006 cancellation of the Conto I inflation adjustment as
illegitimate, as clearly expressed in the 2008 decision of the Consiglio di Stato
According to Claimants, the Consiglio di Stato’s decision found the measure “(i) a
substantial modification of the express terms of Conto I; (ii) a measure with
retroactive effects since it applied to facilities that had already entered into
operation and had been granted tariffs under Conto I; and (iii) a violation of
investors’ legitimate expectations who had relied on certain support regime
conditions when developing their financial and investment plans.”° Claimants
also assert that the GSE continued to pay the inflation-adjusted tariffs throughout
that time.

509. Claimants characterize the GSE as sharply reversing course in 2015 when it
informed operators that no further inflation adjustments would be paid and those
paid previously would be offset against further Conto I tariffs.°"! In response to
Respondent’s counter-argument that the GSE issued a notification in 2009
allegedly putting operators on notice of the “temporary” or “conditional” status of
the 2008 decision of the Consiglio di Stato” Claimants interpret that notification
as, on the contrary, confirming the validity of that decision and assuring continued
availability of the ISTAT-adjusted tariffs.°”°

510. Claimants also assert that only when they notified Italy in 2015 of their
intention to commence international arbitration did the GSE start a procedure to

seek reimbursement, suggesting that Italy’s timing “speaks volumes”.°”*

511. Claimants seek to rebut Respondent’s argument that the 2006 amendment was
justified by Legislative Decree no. 387,°”° requiring that tariffs “progressively

decrease” over time.°”° According to Claimants, the tariffs already met that
requirement without the amendment, since tariff rates decreased based upon the
date when PV facilities entered into operation.©”” Additionally, Claimants argue
that the elimination of inflation adjustments based on Legislative Decree no. 387
could not have been expected by investors, since Italy itself did not have that
interpretation when Conto I was originally issued.°”*

512. Claimants contend that they formed legitimate expectations based on the
explicit terms of Conto I, GSE Agreements referring to Conto I tariffs, the
administrative court decisions of 2006 and 2008, and the continued payment of
inflation-adjusted tariffs until 2015.°” They claim that Italy undermined those
expectations by the allegedly inconsistent and non-transparent treatment accorded
by Italian courts and the GSE. °*° They also claim that Italy violated the ECT’s
umbrella clause because cancellation of the inflation adjustment breached the
obligations which Italy entered into in relation to Conto I facilities pursuant to the
GSE Agreements."

b. Respondent’s Position

513. Respondent argues that Claimants did not have a legitimate expectation of
receiving the ISTAT adjustment under Conto I because they began investing in the
Ttalian PV sector in 2008, after the 2006 amendment to Conto 1. Respondent
concludes that Claimants must have been aware of the 2006 decree revoking the
inflation adjustments. In support of its contention, Respondent notes that a
GSE Agreement from 2009 refers to the 2006 amendment of Conto 1°84

514. Next, Respondent contends that the “overall judicial history invoked by the
Claimants is the best argument to deny the existence of a legitimate expectation”
of continued inflation adjustments.*> Respondent recounts that the first case
appealed to the Consiglio di Stato upheld the TAR’s decision regarding the 2006
amendment to Conto I, but the second case brought before the Consiglio di Stato
was referred to the court’s Plenary Session, whose function is to prevent judicial

conflicts.“ A third decision of the TAR was also brought before the Consiglio di
Stato. According to Respondent, the Consiglio di Stato’s decision in favor of
annulment in one case does not prevent that court from reaching a different result
in a later case regarding the annulled rule.®*? Given that two of the appeals were
pending when Claimants made their investments, Respondent asserts that
Claimants could not have had any basis to form a legitimate expectation of
receiving the inflation adjustment.°**

515. Additionally, in response to Claimants’ contention that the GSE’s 2009 press
release reported on the 2008 decision of the Consiglio di Stato, gave no hint about
the pending appeals, and indicated that the GSE would not “claw back” inflation-
adjusted tariffs already paid, Respondent argues that the 2009 press release was of
minimal importance, since the pending appeals were a “notorious fact” that would
put a PV investor on notice that the 2008 decision might be reversed.°”

516. Finally, Respondent denies that the 2012 decision of the Consiglio di Stato
was, in Claimants’ words, “obviously unlawful”. According to Respondent, the
2012 decision held that revocation of the Conto I inflation adjustment was
legitimate and necessary to reflect the requirement under Legislative Decree no.
387 that the tariffs be of “decreasing amount”. Respondent contends that the
meaning of the 2008 decision was not that the revocation of inflation adjustments
was invalid per se, but that the revocation merely lacked an adequate
motivation.! Accordingly, Respondent argues, the content of the 2008 decision
of the Consiglio di Stato precluded the legitimate expectation that Claimants
assert.

ce. Tribunal Analysis

517. Without denying that the inflation adjustment may have been a factor that
Claimants considered when they invested in the Italian PV sector,©” the Tribunal
finds, however, that the circumstances do not establish a breach of ECT Article
10(1).

691

154

518. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal takes into consideration that two
appeals were pending in the Consiglio di Stato regarding the legitimacy of the
amendment to Conto I at the time when Claimants made their investments. The
Tribunal considers that the GSE’s 2009 press release, while relevant to the
question of legitimate expectations, is not dispositive, since reasonable persons
might have differed concerning its interpretation. In that connection, the GSE’s
practice of continuing to pay the inflation-adjusted tariffs during the pending
appeals but then changing course after the appeals had concluded might have been
confusing to an investor. That, however, is not conducive to a finding of
legitimate expectations.

519. The Tribunal finds it unnecessary to consider the merits of the 2012 decision
of the Plenary Session of the Consiglio di Stato, in particular, as to whether the
availability of ISTAT-adjusted Conto I tariffs was consistent with the provision
under Legislative Decree no. 387 that tariffs be of a “decreasing amount”. The
issue here is not, of course, whether the Consiglio di Stato arrived at correct
decisions.

520. As for Claimants’ assertion that Italy violated the “transparency” standard of
ECT Article 10(1) (first sentence) because of allegedly inconsistent treatment by
different State bodies, the Tribunal finds that the evidence does not establish that
such treatment was inconsistent. It appears, instead, that the GSE did ultimately
conform with the jurisprudence of the Consiglio di Stato. Finally, regarding an
alleged breach of the umbrella clause, the fact that GSE Agreements for PV plants
receiving Conto I tariffs referred to the amended Conto I decree suggests that
Respondent did not enter into an obligation to pay the inflation adjustments.

5. Administrative Fee and Imbalance Costs

a. Claimants’ Position

521. Claimants contend that the administrative fees and imbalance costs charged to
PV producers beginning from 1 January 2013 violated the FET clause, impairment
clause, and umbrella clause.

522. Regarding FET, Claimants assert that the administrative fee, imposed
retroactively on all PV producers receiving Conto incentives, and the imbalance
costs, for which PV producers lost their exemption, in effect reduced the value of
their incentive tariffs. These measures, Claimants assert, undermined the

693

See, e.g., GSE Agreement for PV operator Giova Solar S.R.L., CEX-63.

155

legitimate expectations engendered by Respondent’s explicit guarantee of fixed
rates, expressed in the Conto decrees, verbal declarations of Italian government
officials, Italy’s conduct, and the GSE Agreements."

523. Claimants also contend that these measures violated the standards of
transparency and consistency, as well as good faith, under the FET clause.*
They assert that the GSE’s management expenses and the costs of adding
substantial PV capacity to the grid are “the types of costs inherent in an incentive
support regime” and were entirely foreseeable to Italy. Therefore, Italy should
have informed investors from the beginning if those costs would be allocated to
PV producers, such as by apportioning those costs in the Conto Energia
decrees.” Moreover, for four years from 2008 to 2012, such costs were not
imposed on PV producers.°* Thus, according to Claimants, shifting those costs to
PV producers “midstream” — specifically, after they had invested in the Italian PV
sector — was non-transparent, inconsistent, and indicative of a lack of good
faith.

524. Regarding the impairment clause, Claimants assert that the two measures were
unreasonable for the reasons described above.’°° Additionally, Claimants rebut
Respondent’s assertion that it was reasonable for PV investors to bear the costs
because they were the main beneficiaries of the Conto Energia decrees, arguing
that the public was the main beneficiary, as reflected in the fact that the incentive
schemes were designed so that end-users covered the costs./°! Furthermore,
Claimants contend that the alleged harm to their investments caused by the
measures was admitted by Italy.”” Accordingly, Claimants argue that Italy
breached the impairment clause.”

525. Regarding the umbrella clause, Claimants assert that imposing both
administrative fees and imbalance costs “fundamentally changed the economic
framework enshrined in the GSE Contracts that govern each of Claimants’ PV
plants” and therefore breached Italy’s obligations under the GSE Agreements.’

b. Respondent’s Position

526. Respondent essentially makes three arguments in response to Claimants
regarding an alleged violation of their legitimate expectations.

527. First, Respondent argues that Italy made informed policy choices in creating
the administrative fee measure and allocating imbalance costs to PV producers.
Regarding administrative fees, Respondent asserts that it was “appropriate and
fair” that those receiving feed-in tariffs contribute to covering the costs of
managing the incentive scheme, as stated in the 22nd recital of Conto V and
reflected in Article 25 of the Spalma-incentivi Decree.” Respondent also asserts
that the GSE’s costs were increasing due to its expanded role in monitoring the
incentive schemes.’ Regarding imbalance costs, Respondent asserts that the
exemption previously available “could no longer be deemed acceptable in the light
of the huge development of non-programmable renewable energy sources power
plants [..., which] led to a continuous increase in costs allocated to the generality
of energy users.””””

528. Second, Italy gave no assurance to PV producers that they would not be
required to pay administrative fees or imbalance costs, as acknowledged by
Claimants in their Reply.’ Respondent contends that the alleged guarantee of a
“fixed, stable, and foreseeable revenue stream for twenty years” and the silence of
the Conto Energia decrees regarding imbalance costs (and silence of the first four
Conto decrees regarding administrative fees) were not an assurance that fees and
costs would not be charged for “emerging costs”.”” To suggest otherwise would
“transform the FET clause into a general freezing clause of State regulatory
Activity.”7!° Respondent argues that the common understanding of FET does not
imply that incentive regimes are completely non-modifiable.”!!

529. Third, Respondent argues that the administrative fee entailed only “an
extremely modest loss for each producer”, imposed less than half of the GSE’s
total costs on PV producers, and was implemented in the most efficient manner by

way of an off-set rather than creating a new payment method.” Respondent also
contends that the measure was not retroactive, stating that Article 10(4) of Conto
V “only applied to the future, starting on 1 January 2013.”7"? As for the
imbalance costs, Respondent challenges the assumption that Claimants’ revenues
were reduced.”'* Further, Respondent asserts that Claimants conceded that they
were reimbursed by the GSE after the Consiglio di Stato’s June 2014 decision.’

530. According to Respondent, Claimants’ arguments that the administrative fee
and imbalance costs measures breached the transparency and consistency, and
good faith, standards and the impairment clause under ECT Article 10(1) derive
from Claimants’ legitimate expectations arguments, and are thus subject to the
same defenses.”'® Notwithstanding the alleged overlap, Respondent contends that
the administrative fee and imbalance costs measures were transparent, having
been set forth and published by written rule, and that there is no evidence of bad
faith by the Italian authorities.”"”

531. Regarding the umbrella clause, Respondent first asserts that it is not relevant
in this case, because the umbrella clause does not cover non-contractual
obligations, and also because the GSE Agreements are mere “accessory
contracts”, which were, in any case, not breached.”'* As for Respondent’s specific
defense to the claim that the administrative fee and imbalance costs breached the
umbrella clause by violating the GSE Agreements, Respondent asserts that the
GSE Agreements were silent regarding administrative fees and imbalance costs,
and thus that there were no obligations that Respondent failed to observe.’!°

ce. Tribunal Analysis

532. Asa preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that although the administrative
fee and imbalance costs measures were described separately in the Statement of
Claim, the Parties later grouped together their respective argumentation regarding
the two measures.’”” The Tribunal, having considered each measure individually,
finds it efficient to address both measures under one heading.

533. The Tribunal is mindful of Claimants’ assertion that the administrative fee and
imbalance costs are “the types of costs inherent in an incentive support regime”
and were foreseeable.’”! In the words of NovEnergia’s witness, Bernardo Lucena:

The additional administrative and imbalance costs were foreseeable
consequences to the system of adding significant renewable
generating capacity, and we believed that the original incentive
framework took those costs into consideration in setting the tariffs
promised to PV facilities.”

534. The Tribunal notes, however, Claimants’ acknowledgment that “neither the
Conto Energia decrees nor the GSE Contracts expressly stated that administrative
fees and imbalance costs would be zero.”””?

535. Further, as to the impact of these measures, Claimants asserted that the
administrative fee and imbalance costs did not directly change the incentive tariff
rates granted to PV facilities but instead altered the “general economic
framework”.”*

536. The foreseeability of the administrative fees and imbalance costs raises the
question not only whether Respondent undertook the measures in a transparent,
good faith manner, but also whether Claimants’ assertions of legitimate
expectations are justified. Upon consideration of the Parties’ arguments, the
Tribunal finds that the foreseeability of the costs, the silence regarding those costs
in the Conto Energia decrees and GSE Agreements, and absence of a direct effect
of those costs on the Conto tariffs collectively weigh against the conclusion that
Claimants had a legitimate expectation that such costs would not be imposed on
PV producers. The Tribunal finds that a breach of the principle of good faith by
Respondent is not demonstrated based upon the implementation of the
administrative fees and imbalance costs measures after Claimants had already
developed or acquired PV facilities.

537. For the same reasons, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ impairment
clause claim. It has not been established that the administrative fee or the
imbalance costs were an unreasonable measure that impaired Claimants’

investments. Regarding the administrative fee, the Tribunal takes into
consideration in this context the policy grounds Italy invoked for its decision to
allocate a portion of the GSE’s costs to investors.” The Tribunal has not been
persuaded that those grounds were unreasonable or that the method of collecting
the fee was unreasonable. As for the imbalance costs, the Tribunal notes
Claimants’ assertion that they were reimbursed for imbalance charges as a result
of Resolution 281.”° The Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants’ investments
were impaired by the imbalance costs measure, nor that this measure was
unreasonable. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the administrative fee and
imbalance costs measures did not breach the impairment clause.

538. Finally, with respect to the umbrella clause, the Tribunal observes from its
reasoning above that Claimants were never assured that an administrative fee and
imbalance costs would not be charged, and the GSE Agreements did not so
provide. It cannot be inferred based on Claimants’ arguments that the GSE
Agreements contained an implied provision excluding such measures.
Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the umbrella clause was not breached by
those measures.

D. Damages

1. Introduction

539. In light of the Tribunal’s conclusions on liability, the discussion of damages
below is limited to those issues that are relevant to the incentive tariff reduction
under the Spalma-incentivi Decree. Therefore, quantum issues that relate only to
one of the other disputed measures, such as the assessment of historical losses,
need not be addressed.

540. Claimants have requested full compensation identified as the diminution in the
fair market value of their investments caused by Italy’s measures and calculated
by means of the discounted cash flow (DCF) method.””” Claimants’ quantum
expert, Mr. Edwards of FTI Consulting (FTI, calculates the quantum of damages
owed to Claimants as “the difference between: (a) the value that the Claimants’
investments in Italy would have had if Italy had not introduced the measures that
Claimants contend in this arbitration violated the ECT (the “Counterfactual
Position”); and (b) the value of those investments after the introduction of those
measures (the “Actual Position”).””"> The Counterfactual Position relevant for

present purposes assumes the incentive tariff rate before the Spalma-incentivi
Decree, whereas the Actual Position assumes the reduction (according to Option
A, B, or C) introduced by the Spalma-incentivi Decree.’

541. Claimants’ DCF models calculate the enterprise value of each of their
operating companies as of the valuation date, in the Counterfactual Position and
the Actual Position, thus implicating two DCF calculations.” According to
Claimants, the losses for each company are adjusted based upon Claimants’
effective shareholding for the companies they do not wholly own.”*!

542. According to Claimants’ expert, Greentech, NovEnergia and NIP suffered
losses from the incentive tariff reduction (“IT Decrease”) under the Spalma-
incentivi Decree, as follows:”°

 

 

 

Regulatory Measure Greentech’s losses NovEnergia’s and NIP’s
losses
IT Decrease EUR 7.4 million EUR 4.5 million

 

 

 

 

543. Respondent contends that the standard of “full compensation” is not
appropriate in the present case and, instead, that damages should be “equitably
reduce[d]” for several reasons.’** Further, Respondent contends that even if the
Tribunal finds that damages are owed, Claimants’ assumptions and calculations
are incorrect.” In particular, Respondent argues that the concept of fair market
value and the DCF method are inappropriate in this case.” Respondent’s
quantum experts, Professors Laghi, Paoloni, and Gatti made various objections to
FTI’s damages model, and submitted purported corrections to FTI’s valuation.

2. The “Full Compensation” Standard

544. According to Claimants, since this case does not involve a lawful
expropriation under ECT Article 13, the standard of compensation set forth therein

is not applicable.” Instead, Claimants contend that the full compensation
standard, first established in the 1928 Chorzéw Factory case, applies here.”*”

545. The PCW, in Chorzéw Factory, stated that “reparation must, as far as possible,
wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.””**
According to Claimants, numerous tribunals have applied the full compensation
standard to non-expropriatory treaty violations, including breach of the FET and
other standards.”

546. Respondent appears to acknowledge the general validity of the principle of
full compensation stated in in Chorzéw Factory, but contends that the phrase, “as
far as possible”, forming part of the principle, limits its effect and refers “to the
discretionary power of international tribunals to assess all the circumstances of the
case”.”"° Respondent contends that a number of contextual factors should lead the
Tribunal to reduce any damage award to Claimants, stating as follows:

In the case at stake, the Tribunal should necessarily consider the
general and regulatory character of Italian measures, the absence of
any fraudulent intent whatsoever, the fundamental public purpose
characterizing each of the measures. Accordingly, it should equitably
reduce the amount of compensation (if any) from the full value of
damages.”

547. As additional factors which Respondent considers as justifying a reduction in
damages, Respondent first suggests that Claimants were contributorily negligent,
investing at a time when the regulatory risk was not negligible.” Respondent
also contends that if the Tribunal finds that the Salva Alcoa decree’s extension of
the Conto II eligibility period is not relevant to Respondent’s liability, the

Tribunal should take Salva Alcoa into consideration by offsetting Claimants’
losses by the benefits allegedly accruing to Claimants from the Salva Alcoa."

548. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, absent an applicable treaty provision
on damages, the Chorzéw Factory “full compensation” standard is the appropriate
starting point for quantum assessment. The Tribunal finds that this general
standard applies to FET, umbrella clause, and other treaty violations, and is
therefore not limited to cases of expropriation. The Tribunal does not agree that
the words, “as far as possible”, in any way suggest that a tribunal should weigh
various contextual or equitable factors to award damages below the level of full
compensation. On the contrary, that phrase means that a tribunal must do
whatever it can to ensure that full compensation is granted and the injured party is
made whole.

3. Assumptions and Method of Quantifying Full Compensation

a. Fair Market Value

549. The Parties appear not to agree on whether the appropriate standard for
assessing full compensation in this case is the diminution in the fair market value
of Claimants’ investments as a result of Respondent’s violation of ECT Article
10(1).

550. Claimants contend that the diminution in fair market value is the appropriate
standard.” Respondent objects to an approach based on fair market value,
asserting that it is appropriate only in cases of expropriation or “substantial
deprivation of investors’ rights”, neither of which has occurred here, according to
Respondent.”4* Further, Respondent denies any “consistent practice in

international tribunals” on fair market value in relation to FET breaches.”“°

551. Claimants respond by attributing a simple misunderstanding to Respondent,
clarifying that Claimants are not requesting the “full fair market value of their
investments”, but rather “the diminution in the fair market value”.’*” Further,
Claimants contend that Respondent fails to offer an alternative measure of
damages, noting, however, that Respondent’s experts refer to the “quantification

163

of specific harms” by applying a “lost profits” approach.” Claimants submit that
Respondent’s approach would result in the same or higher damages than
Claimants estimated, as “[i]n general ..., the present value of lost profits should
equal the diminution in market value calculated using a DCF approach.””"”

552. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent has proposed a genuine
alternative to Claimants’ approach that provides a discernible difference. Further,
the Tribunal is not convinced of a lack of consistent practice among international
tribunals on whether to apply a standard of diminution in fair market value in
cases of FET breach. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to calculate
the diminution in fair market value of the affected investments, as proposed by
Claimants.

b. DCF Method

553. A second matter on which the Parties differ is whether DCF is the appropriate
method to calculate the diminution in fair market value of Claimants’ investments.
According to Claimants, “FTI uses the DCF method to calculate the loss in the
value of the Claimants’ investments from the future impact (after the Date of
Assessment) of the challenged measures (‘Future Losses’).””"

554. Claimants submit that the DCF method is appropriate because PV plants have
a relatively predictable performance, in that all of the electricity produced can be
sold, subject to prices that are mostly known and costs that are generally
predictable.”*! Claimants also argue that DCF enables the specific characteristics
of certain assets or companies (such as a plant’s specific tariff rate or productivity
level) and the effect of regulatory changes to be reflected in the value
assessment.” Additionally, Claimants assert that the DCF method is widely used
outside the litigation context by various parties involved in the solar PV sector.’*3

555. Respondent first objects to application of the DCF method on the basis that it
would grant Claimants excessive remuneration.” According to Respondent, the
assessment of damages should reflect the “reduced costs of energy and, more
generally, changed circumstances surrounding the PV market and industry.””*°
Also, Respondent asserts that “[i]nvestment tribunals are not willing to follow the
DCF method in case of FET violation.””*°

556. Next, Respondent asserts that DCF is highly speculative, because it
“monetizes future cash flows.””*” Respondent states that “[t]his point is
particularly exacerbated in the present case because the future cash flow is
constituted, at least with respect to damages caused by the Spalma-incentivi
Decree, by Government incentives, having — as noted above — a gratuity
nature...”7°*

557. In relation to Respondent’s objections, which Claimants contend merely
reiterate Respondent’s liability arguments instead of assessing quantum,
Claimants respond that the Conto Energia decrees “promised specific fixed tariffs,
not a vague return to be determined retroactively in Italy’s discretion” and the
incentive tariffs were not “gratuitous”, but essential to Claimants’ investment
decision.” Further, Claimants submit that the decreasing cost of PV technology
does not benefit existing PV plants.”

558. Claimants respond to Respondent’s assertion about the use of DCF by
investment tribunals by noting a recent study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers
allegedly showing that international arbitration tribunals have applied DCF and
other income-based valuation methods in 69% of cases, and by citing several
investment arbitration awards supporting the application of DCF.”*! Claimants
submit that since their plants have been operational for several years, the
application of DCF is not speculative or uncertain, as it might be in the case of
new investments.’

559. Claimants also assert that the valuation identified by Respondent’s quantum

experts as alternatives to income-based approaches — namely, a comparative
method, a cost-based method, and an asset-based method’ — are either highly
unsuited for the present case, or are indirectly based on the DCF method.” A
comparative valuation method, which assesses a company’s value by referring to
arms’ length transactions in similar companies, is not apt, according to Claimants,
to provide accurate results. First, the compared assets are unlikely to reflect the
specific characteristics of Claimants’ assets. Second, it is hard to obtain reliable
information on transactions, and obtaining an approximate value of assets would
not enable the calculation of a precise valuation.’

560. Regarding the cost-based method proposed by the Respondent, Claimants

S61.

562.

argue that an asset’s replacement value is “not necessarily linked to its profit-
generating potential”, particularly where, as in the case of solar PV assets, the
replacement cost is continuously decreasing.’ Additionally, Claimants assert,
the cost-based method does not reflect the impact of the challenged measures,
since replacement cost is not determined by the tariffs a PV plant is eligible to
receive.

Lastly, as for the asset-based method, which determines the value of a
business by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, the assets are generally
provided in a company’s financial statements based on historical costs. This
subjects them to the same issues as the cost-based method described above. If,
however, the asset is valuated based on “fair value”, then a different method is
needed, typically the DCF method. In any event, according to Claimants, a

second valuation reflecting the Counterfactual Position would still be needed.”**

The Tribunal, having considered the objections and alternatives raised by
Respondent to Claimants’ submissions, finds that the DCF method is appropriate
and should be applied in the damages assessment in this case. The Tribunal notes
that solar PV facilities, as Claimants argued, have a relatively predictable
performance, involve foreseeable costs, and in the present case benefited from
incentive tariffs that were set in advance. The Tribunal is also not persuaded of

the existence of any general reluctance on the part of international tribunals to
apply DCF to breaches such as those found to have occurred in the present case.

c. Valuation Date and Discount Rate

563. Claimants propose to define the valuation date, or date of assessment, as 1
January 2015, which they consider appropriate since it is the effective date of the
Spalma-incentivi Decree, the “final and most significant measure that Claimants
challenge”.”” Claimants cite an investor-state award that fixed the valuation date
as the date of the measure causing “the most serious damages”, where various
measures occurred over a period of years.””° Accordingly, Claimants instructed

FTI to quantify damages with the assumption of 1 January 2015 as the valuation
date.”

564. Respondent referred to the opinion of their quantum experts, who expressed
the view that 1 January 2015 was inappropriate because “[a]rbitrators request to
have a complete and exhaustive knowledge of the relevant market developments
up to the date of adjudication” and because it results in a backward-looking
assessment of historical losses from the disputed measures that took effect before
the valuation date.””

565. The Tribunal finds that, for the reasons expressed by Mr. Edwards, 1 January
2015 is the appropriate valuation date.””? That date coincides with the effective
date of the Spalma-incentivi Decree’s modification of the incentive tariffs. Given
that the incentive tariff reduction under the Spalma-incentivi Decree is the only
measure that Claimants have successfully proved to have constituted a violation of
the ECT, and that Respondent’s quantum experts’ criticisms regarding the
proposed date of assessment do not relate solely to the Spalma-incentivi Decree
(but rather relate to the measures for which historical losses would have existed at
that date), the Tribunal considers that the valuation date proposed by Claimants is
appropriate.

566. As for the discount rate to be applied, Claimants’ expert, Mr. Edwards,
assumed a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of 5%.’ Respondent’s
quantum experts, Professors Laghi, Paoloni and Gatti, raised several objections to

the WACC applied by Mr. Edwards, asserting that a range of 6.30% to 7.63% was
more appropriate.””>

567. Respondent’s quantum experts criticize Mr. Edwards’ application of a single
WACC over the entire time horizon of the investments as inappropriate, arguing
that the investments are unlikely to be stable over time, and that Claimants’
investments/companies vary too greatly in size and other characteristics.’”°
Respondent’s experts also argue that basing the risk-free rate on the yield on 10-
year bonds issued by the German government at the date of assessment is
improper, not only because, they assert, the Italian risk-free rate should be applied
but also because an estimate derived from a monthly average — rather than a point
in time — is more reliable.” Their other main criticism appears to be that Mr.
Edwards underestimated the market-risk premium, which they assert should be
between 5.4% and 8.6%."

568. With respect to the objection to applying the yield on 10-year German
government bonds, Mr. Edwards suggests that Professors Laghi, Paoloni and Gatti
have merely misunderstood his assumptions.” Mr. Edwards argues that
Respondent’s experts would, by applying the yield on Italian government bonds,
double-count the general macroeconomic risk of an equity investment in Italy,
because Mr. Edwards’ model already reflects that risk in the country risk premium
included in his calculation of the cost of equity.”"° As regards Mr. Edwards’
market risk premium that Respondent’s experts assert is too low, Mr. Edwards
refers to several authors and academics in support of his 5.0% figure, including
the authorities referenced by Respondents’ experts.”*

569. Upon consideration of the opinions of both sides’ quantum experts, the
Tribunal finds that the assumptions underlying Mr. Edwards’ application of a
WACC of 5% are reasonable and appropriate. The Tribunal is not persuaded by
the criticisms by Professors Laghi, Paoloni and Gatti in this regard.

570. In the view of the Tribunal majority, damages for Respondent’s breach of the
FET standard, impairment clause, and umbrella clause under ECT Article 10(1)
amount to €11.9 million plus interest, with €7.4 million awarded to Greentech and
€4.5 million awarded to NovEnergia.

5. Interest

571. Claimants request an award of pre-award and post-award compound interest
“at the highest lawful rate from the Date of Assessment until the date Italy pays
the award in full”.”* They also state that they claim an “international commercial
rate”, such as 6-month average LIBOR plus 2 percent per year, or annual LIBOR,
would be appropriate.’*°

572. Further, Claimants request that any award of interest require compound
interest, arguing that compound interest is the generally accepted standard in
international investment arbitrations.’** Claimants assert, on one hand, that a
grant of compound ensures that an injured party is restored fully to the position it
would have been in had the breach not occurred, which would not be achieved by
simple interest.”* Further, Claimants assert that compound interest prevents
unjust enrichment of the party committing the breach, since it prevents the
breaching party to benefit from the equivalent of an “interest-free loan” by paying
only simple interest.”*° Finally, Claimants argue that compound interest promotes
efficiency by eliminating a possible incentive for a respondent to delay arbitral
proceedings.’*”

573. Respondent submits that pre-award interest should not be granted, and that
only post-award interest is appropriate.’** Respondent submits that since “the
very most part of supposed damages concern future events (such as the future
incentives to be granted by Italy)”, interest running only from the date of the
award is appropriate.’*°

574. Regarding the manner of calculating interest, Respondent asserts that only
simple interest, if any, should be granted, arguing that it is less speculative,
reflects the circumstances of the case, the damages occurred very recently, and
Claimants received substantial benefits from the incentive schemes.’”°

575. Having considered the Parties’ opposing positions with respect to pre-award
interest, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s proposal that the Tribunal
deny pre-award interest to Claimants. Although the bulk of the damages flowing
from the tariff reduction under the Spalma-incentivi Decree may be in the future,
the principle of full compensation is incompatible with a decision that deliberately
omits compensation for harms occurring in the past simply because they constitute
a smaller portion of the damages.

576. As for the issue of whether simple or compound interest is appropriate,
Respondent has failed to supply any authority supporting its view that simple
interest would be appropriate in this case. This contrasts with the extensive set of
authorities presented by Claimants, including investor-state arbitration awards and
scholarly writings, weighted decisively in favor of awards of compound interest.

577. Based on the foregoing, a majority of the Tribunal concludes that the damages
for which Respondent is liable under this award shall accrue interest starting from
the Date of Assessment until the date of this award at the rate of annual LIBOR
plus 2% per annum, compounded annually. Further, a majority of the Tribunal
concludes that interest starting from the date of this award until the date when
Respondent fully compensates Claimants shall accrue at the rate of annual LIBOR
plus 2% per annum, compounded annually.

E. Costs

1. Claimants’ Submissions on Costs

578. According to their 25 October 2018 submission, Claimants seek an award of
all costs, fees, and expenses incurred in this arbitration, in the total amount of
EUR 3,294,535.57. Claimants provide the below summary in their costs
submission, with a detailed breakdown in Annex A thereto.

Legal fees of King & Spalding in the amount of EUR 1,224,996.50.
Legal fees of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in the amount of EUR 614,004.53.
Expert fees and expenses of FTI Consulting in the amount of EUR 725,702.63.

e Expert fees and expenses of Prof. Antonio D’Atena in the amount of EUR

e Claimants’ costs and expenses in the amount of EUR 201,831.91.

e Payments to the SCC for registration, advance on costs, and an additional advance
on costs in the amount of EUR 478,000.00.

579. Claimants argue that Article 44 of the SCC Rules endorses the “loser pays”
tule whereby an unsuccessful party must reimburse the costs and expenses of the
successful party.””! Claimants argue that even if they do not prevail in respect of
all of their claims, they may still be regarded as the successful party and entitled to
a full award of costs.”

580. According to Claimants, the Tribunal should take into account that
Respondent repeatedly failed to pay its portion of the arbitration costs, and
Claimants had to pay more than eighty percent of the Respondent’s advances on
costs requested by the scc.”3 Claimants also note that Respondent did not pay
its share of the court reporter’s fees for the evidentiary hearing.”

2. Respondent’s Submissions on Costs

581. According to Respondent’s 29 October 2018 submission, Respondent incurred
a total of EUR 862,485.88 in costs, which Respondent summarized as follows:

e Legal fees in the amount of EUR 664,823.00.
e Expenses and Expert expenses in the amount of EUR 60,000.00.

583. Concerning Respondent’s share of the advance on the costs of the arbitration
and the share of court reporter’s fees that Respondent had not yet paid, on
12 November 2018, after the formal close of proceedings, Respondent wrote to the
SCC with members of the Tribunal in copy, requesting to receive an invoice from
the SCC which Respondent stated that it would endeavor to pay. Respondent
wrote as follows:

Upon reception, we will immediately send the invoice for costs by
SCC at the time of the award to the relevant Administration for
payment, that should include all expenses incurred for the
completion of the procedure while, parcelized payment of separate
invoices by third parties providing individual services would be
more problematic, since that would require prior acceptance, most
often following a sort of bid for comparative offers for the same
services.

584. On 13 November 2018, Respondent wrote to clarify that the invoice it was
requesting should “represent the last tranche of payment of administrative costs
concerning the procedure, up to its closing and the rendering of the award, so that
the administrations will definitively settle all outstanding payment requests.”

3. Tribunal’s Findings on Costs

585. Pursuant to Article 43 of the SCC Rules, the costs of the arbitration consist of
(i) the fees of the arbitral tribunal, (ii) the administrative fee of the SCC, and (iii)
the expenses of the arbitral tribunal and the SCC. Unless otherwise agreed by the
parties, the arbitral tribunal shall, at the request of a party, apportion the costs of
the arbitration between the parties, having regard to the outcome of the case and
other relevant circumstances. The parties are jointly and severally liable to the
arbitrators and to the SCC for the costs of the arbitration.

586. On7 December 2018, the Board of the SCC determined the costs of the
arbitration as follows:

e The costs for the chairman of the Tribunal, Professor William W. Park, amount
to EUR 152,500 (fees), EUR 5,975 (expenses), and EUR 3,500 (per diem
allowance).

e The costs for co-arbitrator, Mr. David R. Haigh, Q.C., amount to EUR 91,500
(fees), EUR 5,293 (expenses), and EUR 5,500 (per diem allowance).

e The costs for co-arbitrator, Professor Giorgio Sacerdoti, amount to EUR
91,500 plus any Value Added Tax due (fees), EUR 2,768 (expenses), and EUR
5,000 (per diem allowance).

172

e The costs for the administrative secretary, Mr. Jeremy M. Bloomenthal,
amount to EUR 24,221 and US$ 2,325 (fees).

e The costs of the SCC amount to EUR 38,600 (administrative fee), EUR 52,257
(Expenses, as reimbursed for the Tribunal), and EUR 11,865 (court reporter’s
invoice paid on behalf of Respondent).

587. In acommunication to the SCC on 8 December 2018, the Tribunal noted the
potential overlap of items related to expenses (included both for SCC and for
arbitrators) and the uncertainty of whether Respondent had ever paid its share of
the court reporter’s fees. In a communication from the SCC on 9 December 2018,
the SCC clarified that Respondent had not paid its share of the court reporter’s fee
within the deadline of 5 December 2018 set by the SCC. The SCC also clarified
that out of a total amount paid by the parties of EUR 570,000, Claimants had paid
EUR 478,000 and Respondent had paid EUR 92,000. On 12 December, pursuant
to further questions from the Tribunal, the SCC indicated that there was a surplus
on the account of EUR 46,000, being the Claimants’ payment of half of the
Respondent’s additional advances, later paid by the Respondent, but never
reimbursed to Claimants.

588. The Tribunal has noted that Value Added Tax must be added to the above
amounts where applicable.

589. Additionally, pursuant to Article 44 of the SCC Rules, the arbitral tribunal
may in the final award upon the request of a party, order one party to pay any
reasonable costs incurred by another party, including costs for legal
representation, having regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant
circumstances.

590. The Parties have not agreed on the apportionment of the costs of the
arbitration and have instead left this determination to the Tribunal.

591. In the circumstances of the present case, Claimants have successfully
established Respondent’s liability with respect to the incentive tariff reduction
pursuant to the Spalma-incentivi Decree, which was Claimant’s largest claim in
terms of the amount of damages attributable to it. Claimants have also prevailed
in regard to the quantum of damages attributable to this claim. Respondent, in
turn, was unsuccessful in its main jurisdictional objections and repeated
bifurcation requests.

592. The Tribunal notes that Respondent did not timely pay its share of the advance
on costs in the required amounts and that Respondent did not pay its share of the
court reporter’s fees in accordance with the Tribunal’s First Procedural Order and
repeated reminders to that effect. The Tribunal also notes that Respondent has
invoked its domestic rules regarding procurement as a reason for not paying

173

administrative costs. Finally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent, after close of
proceedings, stated that it would make its best efforts to pay its share of the costs.

593. Accordingly, having regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant
circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that it is fair that Respondent should bear
the full costs of the arbitration under Article 43 of the SCC Rules, including the
amount of EUR 478,000.00 paid by Claimants. The Tribunal also concludes that
fairness requires that Respondent bear one half of the other arbitration-related
expense of Claimants, including legal fees, expert fees and costs, and other costs
and expenses, in accordance with Article 44 of the SCC Rules (the “other costs”).
Those “other costs” amount to EUR 3,294,535.57 less EUR 478,000 for a net
amount of EUR 2,816,535.57, of which half would be EUR 1,408,268 when
rounded to the nearest Euro.

VI. Disposition

594. For the reasons set forth in this Final Award, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(a) The Tribunal affirms its jurisdiction under the ECT and the SCC Rules with
respect to Claimants’ claims, except those derived from taxation measures
excluded under ECT Article 21, namely the “Robin Hood Tax” and
classification of PV facilities as immovable property.

(b) Through incentive tariff reduction provisions of Article 26(3) of the Spalma-
incentivi Decree (Law Decree No. 91/2014 converted into Law 116/2014),
Respondent failed to accord fair and equitable treatment (FET) to Claimants,
impaired Claimants’ investments by unreasonable measures, and failed to
observe obligations entered into with respect to relevant investments of
Claimants, in breach of obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT. With
respect to these findings, the Tribunal reached its decision by a majority.

(c) Respondent did not breach its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT by
introducing and applying to Claimants’ investments the modifications of the
minimum guaranteed price scheme, the tariff payment term change,
administrative fees and imbalance costs, or by having cancelled the STAT
inflation adjustment. With respect to the minimum guaranteed price scheme, the
Tribunal reached its decision by a majority.

(d) As compensation for the damages caused to Claimants by the breaches listed
above, Respondent shall pay EUR 7.4 million to Greentech and EUR 4.5 million
to NovEnergia and NIP, amounting in total to EUR 11.9 million in favor of
Claimants.

(e) Respondent shall pay Claimants interest on the sums awarded from 1 January
2015 (the date of the Spalma-incentivi Decree) at the annual LIBOR rate plus

2% per annum, compounded annually.

(f) Respondent shall reimburse Claimants for the entirety of their contribution to the
costs of the arbitration, in an amount of EUR 478,000.

(g) Respondent shall reimburse Claimants for one half (50%) of their legal and
related expenses in the amount of EUR 1,408,268.
