Il. Chronology

The following summary is a general summary based on the factual evidence adduced
in the present proceeding. It does not purport to be exhaustive. Rather, it gives an
overview of the general factual background of the present dispute. If necessary, the
Arbitral Tribunal will examine further factual elements regarding each claim in its
legal considerations (Part B of the present award).

The agreements

On 13 December 1996, Fischer Air bought two aircraft from Ansett Worldwide
Aviation Limited. The aircraft consisted of a Boeing Model 737-33A, Serial Number
27469 (hereinafter “Aircraft 1”) and a Boeing Model 737-33A, Serial Number 27910
(hereinafter “Aircraft 2”, together with Aircraft 1 “the Aircraft”). The purchase price
of each aircraft amounted to USD 35,700,000.00 (Exh C-113, p. 2).

On 14 March 1997, HSH provided AMF with financing for the purchase of Aircraft 1
and entered into loan agreements with Mr Fischer and Mr Meier (hereinafter “Loan
Agreement 1”) with respect to an initial loan amount of USD 6,000,000.00 and an
additional loan amount of USD 1,500,000.00 (Exh R-10, pp. 6-7).

On the same day, Fischer Air and AMF concluded an aircraft purchase agreement
(hereinafter “Purchase Agreement 1”), pursuant to which Fischer Air sold Aircraft 1
to AMF. The purchase price of USD 35,700,000.00 was transferred by AMF to an
account of Ansett Worldwide Aviation Equipment with Citibank N.A. in New York
(Exh C-107, p. 64 of the pdf).

On 7 April 1997, Fischer Air and AMF signed a lease agreement (hereinafter “Lease
Agreement 1”). AMF leased Aircraft 1 to Fischer Air for a monthly net rent of
USD 333,000.00, payable to an account in New York (Exh R-10, p. 14). There seems
to be an inconsistency in the amount of the rent as the amendment of 2003 refers to a

monthly net rent of 337,000.00 under the Lease Agreement | (Exh R-10, p. 65 of the
pdf)

On 17 April 1997, HSH provided financing for the purchase of Aircraft 2 and
concluded a loan agreement with Mr Fischer (hereinafter “Loan Agreement 2”) with
respect to an initial loan amount of USD 7,500,000.00 (Exh C-106, p. 6; Exh C-105,
p. 1).

On the same day, Fischer Air and AVF concluded an aircraft purchase agreement
(hereinafter “Purchase Agreement 2”). Fischer Air sold Aircraft 2 to AVF, which
transferred the purchase price of USD 35,700,000.00 to an account of Ansett
Worldwide Aviation Equipment with Citibank N.A. in New York (Exh C-107, p. 97
of the pdf).

On the same day, Fischer Air and AVF signed a lease agreement (hereinafter “Lease
Agreement 2”). AVF leased Aircraft 2 to Fischer Air for a monthly net rent of
USD 337,000.00, payable to an account in New York (Exh C-106, p. 14).

In 2003, due to financial difficulties, Mr Fischer sold Fischer Air and Fischer Travel
to Mr Komarek, remaining a shareholder of the companies (Exh R-8).

 

On 3 March 2003, Mr Fischer lost influence in Fischer Air and Fischer Travel due to
Mr Komarek increasing the companies’ capital (Exh R-14). Mr Komarek subsequently
changed Fischer Air’s business name to Charter Air.

On 14 November 2003, the Lease Agreement | and the Lease Agreement 2 (together
“Lease Agreements”) were amended. Inter alia, the monthly net rents of the Aircraft
were reduced to USD 230,000.00 (Exh R-10, p. 65 of the pdf; Exh C-106, p. 68 of the
pdf).

In January 2004, Mr Fischer left the management of Fischer Travel and Fischer Air
(Exh R-14).

In April 2004, AVF and AMF merged, resulting in the cessation of AVF and AMF
becoming its sole legal successor (Exh C-134).

The bankruptcy proceedings in Germany

On 2 March 2005, Mr Fischer filed a petition for initiation of bankruptcy proceedings
on his own estate with the District Court of Hamburg (Exh C-208).

On 11 March 2005, an expert report on the assets and liabilities of Mr Fischer was
presented before the District Court of Hamburg (Exh R-9). This report also contained
information concerning AMF and was based on AMF’s financial statements (Exh
R-9).

On 16 March 2005, the Court of first instance in Hamburg (Amtsgericht) opened
insolvency proceedings against Mr Fischer (Exh C-211).

The bankruptcy proceedings in the Czech Republic

Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy proceedings

On 10 February 2005, Atlantik IB., Mr Komarek’s company, filed a petition for
involuntary bankruptcy against Mr Fischer in the Czech Republic (Exh C-68).

On 8 March 2005, the Municipal Court in Prague (hereinafter “Municipal Court”)
appointed Mi as preliminary trustee to the bankruptcy case of Mr Fischer
(Exh C-165).

On 29 March 2005, in a letter to the Municipal Court, Mr Fischer proposed that the
bankruptcy proceedings against him be dismissed (Exh C-69). He further lodged an
appeal against the Municipal Court’s resolution of 8 March 2005, by which
Mi had been appointed preliminary trustee (Exh C-69).

On 26 April 2005, the Municipal Court opened bankruptcy proceedings against
Mr Fischer and appointed Mi as bankruptcy trustee (Exh C-5, p. 1).

On 16 May 2005, Mr Fischer appealed to the High Court in Prague (hereinafter
“High Court”) against the Municipal Court’s decision to open the bankruptcy
proceedings (Exh C-73).

On 9 September 2005, the High Court upheld the Municipal Court’s decision dated
26 April 2005 and qualified the proceedings as secondary to the bankruptcy
proceedings in Germany (Exh C-7; C-85).

On 10 October 2005, the creditors’ meeting unanimously ordered Mi to
include the Aircraft into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (Exh C-146, p. 1).

On 11 October 2005, Mi included the Aircraft into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy
estate (Exh C-41, p. 1).

On 12 October 2005, Mi informed Mi. Mr Fischer’s legal

representative, that the Aircraft had been included into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate
upon order of the creditors’ committee (Exh C-41, p. 1). Mi further wrote
that, “according to the existing interpretations, a limited partnership formed under
German law is not a legal entity, and its property is thus in the joint ownership of the
partners, of which the bankrupt’s share constitutes 75%” (Exh C-41, p. 1).

On 13 October 2005, Charter Air suspended the monthly instalments to AMF, starting
with the instalment that was due in October 2005 (Exh C-8).

On 20 October 2005, we AMF’s legal representative, requested
Mi to exclude the Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate, stating that
“the legal opinion asserted by the creditors, who proposed the inclusion of the
aforesaid aircraft [...] in the bankruptcy estate inventory, is not correct” (Exh C-42).
Mi pointed out several provisions of German law supporting his position
(Exh C-42, p. 2).

On 25 October 2005, Mr Fischer filed an appellate review with the Supreme Court of
the Czech Republic (hereinafter “Supreme Court”), contesting the High Court’s
decision dated 9 September 2005 (cf: above para. 26) considering that the conditions
to open secondary insolvency proceedings against Mr Fischer in the Czech Republic
were met (Exh C-88, pp. 5-6).

On 2 November 2005, AMF’s legal representative provided Mi with a legal
opinion written by Heribert Hirte, Professor from the University of Hamburg, further
supporting the position that the Aircraft should be excluded from Mr Fischer’s
bankruptcy estate (Exh C-62).

On_ 14 November 2005, Mi removed the Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s
bankruptcy estate (Exh C-9, C-43).

On the same day, during a creditors’ meeting, Mo asked to be removed from
the office of bankruptcy trustee due to his medical condition (Exh C-83, p. 1).

On 15 November 2005, the Municipal Court removed Mi from his office and
appointed Mi as the new bankruptcy trustee (Exh C-83).

On 28 November 2005, Mi informed the Czech Civil Aviation Authority that
he had included the Aircraft into the bankruptcy estate of Mr Fischer (Exh C-55).

On 12 December_2005, AMF objected to the re-inclusion of the Aircraft into
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (Exh C-10).

On the same day, Mr Fischer’s legal representative requested the Municipal Court to
remove Mi from the role of bankruptcy trustee (Exh C-90).

On 15 December 2005, AMF filed an action with the Municipal Court for the exclusion
of the Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (Exh C-118).

On 4 January 2006, the Municipal Court informed Mi that “[i]n view of the
fundamentally differing legal analyses pertaining to the ownership” of the Aircraft,
“the question of the ownership ... must be decided in a proper court proceeding.” The
Municipal Court further stated that Mi was “obligated to take such measures
for the protection of the aircraft so that the value thereof does not decrease”. The
Municipal Court added that the bankruptcy trustee “shall not take any irreversible
steps in the matter” until the pending appeals against his appointment and the
declaration of bankruptcy are resolved (Exh C-80).

On 17 January 2006, the Municipal Court dismissed the request to remove we
as bankruptcy trustee (Exh C-92).

On 19 January 2006, AMF expressed its concern to Mii with regards to the
current technical condition of the Aircraft (Exh C-44).

On the same day, AMF asked the Municipal Court to exercise supervisory activities in
order to ensure, inter alia, that the Aircraft are properly maintained and that “the
Aircraft are leased out and the rent paid into the bankruptcy estate” (Exh C-45).

On 1 February 2006, the High Court confirmed the Municipal Court’s decision to
dismiss the request to remove Mi (Exh C-95). The High Court observed that
under Czech law, the trustee “is obliged to include every single item ... which [he]
considers to be a (potential) part of the bankruptcy assets, even if in doubt about
whether it really is a part of the bankruptcy assets,” and concluded that the trustee
“had proceeded with due care and listed the said aircraft in the bankruptcy assets
correctly,” and he “invited the excluding action to be initiated” in the courts (Exh C-95,
p. 3).

On 13 February 2006, Charter Air was declared bankrupt (cf. below para. 93) and
Mri was appointed as bankruptcy trustee (Exh R-23).

On 6 March 2006, AMF informed Mii that the Aircraft were no longer insured
because Charter Air had stopped paying the insurance premiums (Exh C-48, p. 2 of
the pdf). In the same letter, AMF inquired whether the Aircraft were insured and who
performed the “reasonable regular maintenance of the Aircraft” (Exh C-48, p. 3 of the
pdf).

On 7 March 2006, Mr Fischer filed an “Extension of the appeal against the resolution
of the Municipal Court dated 17 January 2006”, referring to a new development (Exh
C-94, p. 2).

On_13 March 2006, since it had not received an answer to the letter dated
6 March 2006, AMF wrote another letter to Mri asking whether the Aircraft
were insured and who performed the maintenance (Exh C-48, p. 4 of the pdf).

On the same day, AMF informed the Municipal Court that the Aircraft were neither
insured nor regularly maintained and asked the Court to exercise its supervisory
powers in order to remedy the situation (Exh C-48, p. 1 of the pdf).

On 24 April 2006, the Municipal Court excluded the Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s
bankruptcy estate (Exh C-61). The Municipal Court stated that “the aircraft had been
entered in the bankruptcy estate unlawfully, of which the Defendant as the liquidator
was very well aware.” (Exh C-61, p. 4).

On 29 May 2006, we launched an appeal against the judgement of
24 April 2006 before the High Court (Exh C-121).

On 14 September 2006, upon request of we Euro-Trend s.r.o. carried out an
expert valuation of the Aircraft for the purposes of sale as part of bankruptcy (Exh
C-49).

On 13 November 2006, Slovenské aerolinie a.s. (hereinafter “Slovenské aerolinie”),
an aviation company operating in the Slovak Republic, signed a letter of intent with
Air Consulting, a consulting company focusing on air business and operating in the
Czech Republic, with AMF, HSH and We | (Exh C-57). Slovenské aerolinie
offered to “provide an initial investment in order to return the aircraft to a condition
fit for operation”, provided that AMF, HSH and Mr agree to a five-year lease
agreement between AMF, as the lessor, and Slovenské aerolinie, as the lessee (Exh
C-57).

On 23 November 2006, the Municipal Court consented to Mri conducting
negotiations regarding the lease of the Aircraft and ordered Mi to obtain written
consent from the interested parties, in particular from Mri. HSH, Mr Fischer,
creditors’ representatives and AMF (Exh C-160).

On _12 December 2006, in a letter to Mr. Mri the representative of
Mr Fischer’s creditors, expressed regret that the lease of the Aircraft to Slovenksé
aerolinie had failed due to the disapproval of HSH. He also asked the bankruptcy
trustee to act in strict accordance with the Bankruptcy and Settlement Act, and not to
allow HSH, a non-authorised entity and not a creditor of Mr Fischer, to interfere in the
bankruptcy process (Exh R-36).

On 14 December 2006, at a meeting with the interested parties related to Mr Fischer’s
bankruptcy proceedings, HSH suggested to sell the Aircraft. It stated that a party
outside of the Czech Republic was willing to purchase them for USD 27,000,000.00.
HSH insisted that the price for both Aircraft be at minimum USD 27,000,000.00. The
interested parties noted that, since the Aircraft were still registered simultaneously in
two different bankruptcy estates, the first condition to the sale was the consent of
we | All interested parties expressed their various views concerning HSH’s
suggestion and related issues (Exh C-161).

On 18 December 2006, Mi requested the Municipal Court to consent to the sale
of the Aircraft by private sale, outside court auction, to the person presenting the
highest written bid (Exh C-162).

On 3 January 2007, the Municipal Court consented to Mi selling the Aircraft
outside auction under the condition that Mr. Mr Fischer, Mr Meier and HSH all
expressly agree to the sale in writing and in advance (Exh C-185).

On 29 January 2007, Mr Fischer’s legal representative requested the Municipal Court
to restrict the unlawful conduct of Mi stating that the trustee was preparing the
sale of the Aircraft without the consent of Mr Fischer (Exh C-159).

On 1 February 2007, upon AMF’s request, the Municipal Court made AMF’s prior
written consent an additional condition to any private sale of the Aircraft outside a
court auction (Exh C-153).

On the same day, the Municipal Court responded to the request of Mr Fischer’s legal
representative dated 29 January 2007, explaining that it had no information about the
alleged conduct of Mri It further stated that “[t]here is no risk of immediate
destruction or depreciation. The aircraft have been standing at the airport for a
number of months and will not be significantly depreciated in the course of an
additional month. By this time, the due, approved sale of the aircraft should be carried
out according to the trustee’s estimate” (Exh C-159).

On 2 February 2007, the High Court annulled the judgement of the Municipal Court
dated 24 April 2006 (cf above para. 51), by which it had excluded the Aircraft from
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate, and referred the case back to the Municipal Court (Exh
C-129, p. 12).

On 8 March 2007, the Municipal Court approved that we | was entitled to give
his consent to Mri to sell the Aircraft (Exh C-13, p. 2).

On 9 March 2007, Mri informed the Municipal Court that the position of HSH
made it impossible to continue with the negotiations of the sale, even if all the other
stakeholders agreed with the sale (Exh R-37, p. 2 of the pdf). He further considered it
“important to note that HSH Nord Bank thwarted also the previous intention to lease
the aircraft in a similar manner’, believing that “the reason why the aircraft were not
sold to Norwegian Air Shuttle can be attributed exclusively to HSH” (Exh R-37, p. 2
of the pdf).

On 3 April 2007, Vi informed Mri that his clients, Mr Fischer,
Mr Meier and AMF, would only consent to the sale under the condition that the bids
would be possible to assess in advance, in order to evaluate potential buyers and the
draft purchase contract prior to the sale (Exh C-152, p. 2).

On 5 April 2007, Mri informed the Municipal Court that HSH would only give
its consent to the sale of the Aircraft if the buyer is approved by HSH and if its other
conditions are also fulfilled (Exh C-152, p. 2).

On 12 April 2007, Mi informed the Municipal Court that mould had been
identified in Aircraft 2 and that, if the Aircraft remained parked under the current
conditions, there was a risk that the mould would spread to Aircraft 1 (Exh C-152,
p. 2).

On the same day, the Municipal Court amended the conditions of sale of the Aircraft,
in that the sale no longer required consent from Mr Fischer, Mr Meier, AMF and HSH.
The Court was of the opinion “that the prompt sale of the respective aircraft, which
seems now to be realistic, is advantageous for all the interested parties in terms of the
ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.” It further stated that “any delay in the sale of the

aircraft, to which the fulfilment of conditions for consent would necessarily lead,
would increase the risk of damage to the aircraft and could consequently impede the
possibility of selling the aircraft” (Exh C-152, p. 2).

On 19 April 2007, in a letter to the Municipal Court, VM expressed his
views on the sale of the Aircraft and requested the Court to cancel its amendments on
the conditions of sale made on 12 April 2007 (Exh C-157).

On 20 April 2007, AMF filed a constitutional complaint with the Czech Constitutional
Court (hereinafter “Constitutional Court”), seeking the annulment of the Municipal
Court’s decision dated 12 April 2007 (Exh C-1, p. 1)

On the same day, Aerotech s.r.o., a company providing the required minimum
maintenance of the Aircraft, conducted a visual inspection of the Aircraft, noticing that
“corrosion of the Dural construction is starting to appear on both aircraft. [...]
Furthermore, mould was discovered in the interior of the aircraft during inspection.”
According to Aerotech s.r.0., “[t]he reason for this condition is the long-term standing
and non-aerial operation of the aircraft (17 months) under climatic conditions in CZ
(large temperature changes and high humidity)” (Exh C-141).

On 23 April 2007, we notified the Municipal Court about the inspection by
Aeortech s.r.o. and the discovery of mould inside the Aircraft (Exh C-53).

On 24 April 2007, the Municipal Court addressed a letter to Ma.
providing a detailed response to Vi views on the issue of the sale of
the Aircraft and the contents of Ve letter dated 19 April 2007 (Exh
C-156, p. 3).

On the same day, TNT Airways, financed by the leasing company Guggenheim
Partners, offered to purchase the Aircraft for USD 25,000,000.00 (Exh C-167, p. 4 of
the pdf).

On 27 April 2007, upon AMF’s motion, the Municipal Court issued a preliminary
injunction, ordering Mri to refrain from selling the Aircraft without AMF’s
consent (Exh C-166).

On 21 May 2007, Air Consulting s.r.o. (hereinafter “Air Consulting”), a consulting
company focusing on air business, analysed the current condition of the Aircraft,
concluding that, for numerous reasons stated in the report, the sale of the Aircraft was
urgent (Exh C-167, p. 4 of the pdf).

On 24 May 2007, Mi informed the Municipal Court that AVITAS, an
internationally qualified assessor for the International Society for Transport Aircraft
Trading, assessed the Aircraft in their current condition to have the value of
USD 10,600,000.00 (Exh C-167, p. 1 of the pdf).

On 25 June 2007, the High Court confirmed the preliminary injunction issued by the
Municipal Court on 27 April 2007 (cf. above para. 75) (Exh C-163).

On_17 September_2007, the Constitutional Court partially admitted AMF’s
constitutional complaint, annulling part of the Municipal Court’s decision dated
12 April 2007 (cf: above para. 69) (Exh C-1, p. 10).

On 24 October 2007, Aircraft 2 was inspected by Ms a. judge at the
Municipal Court, Ms. assistant to the judge, AMF’s legal representative, the
creditors’ representative, We | an airport technician and Ms General
Manager of Air Consulting. They found that, due to the long-term parking on the
ground and to extensive mould and rust, the value of Aircraft 2 continued to decrease
(Exh C-154).

On 29 October 2007, the Municipal Court excluded the Aircraft from the bankruptcy
estate of Mr Fischer because “the aircraft had been registered in the inventory of the
bankruptcy estate illegitimately” (Exh R-28, p. 10). The Municipal Court referred to
an earlier “ruling” of the Constitutional Court of 24 April 2007, in which the
Constitutional Court stated that “the sale of the aircraft would result in a
disproportionately greater harm for the Plaintiff than the potential harm threatening
the bankruptcy estate from postponing the enforceability of the resolution of the
Municipal Court in Prague of 12 April 2007, [...] according to which consent of the
company was not required for the sale of the aircraft” (Exh R-28, p. 3).

On 29 November 2007, we filed an appeal with the High Court against the
judgement of the Municipal Court dated 29 October 2007 (Exh C-132).

On 31 January 2008, the Supreme Court cancelled the resolution of the High Court of
9 September 2005, which had confirmed the opening of bankruptcy proceedings
against Mr Fischer (cf: above para. 28), and the resolution of the Municipal Court of
26 April 2005, which had declared bankruptcy against Mr Fischer (cf. above para. 24),
returning the case to the Municipal Court for further proceedings (Exh C-100). The
Supreme Court decided that it had not been proven that Mr Fischer had an
establishment in the Czech Republic within the meaning of the Council Regulation
(EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (hereinafter “IR 2000”) (Exh C-100,
pp. 22-23 of the pdf).

On 16 April 2008, the High Court dismissed Mi appeal against the judgement
of the Municipal Court of 29 October 2007 (cf: above para. 82), which had excluded
the Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (Exh C-127). The High Court did not
resolve Mi specific arguments on appeal regarding the appropriateness of
originally including the Aircraft in the estate, but rather found that the issue had
become moot by virtue of the Supreme Court’s intervening decision (cf above
para. 84) that Mr Fischer had not been shown to have a permanent establishment in
the Czech Republic, allowing secondary bankruptcy proceedings against him at all.
The High Court concluded, inter alia, that “the bankruptcy declared against

92.

bankrupt's property has been cancelled,” i.e., there was no “continuing bankruptcy
against [the] bankrupt's property” and, therefore, the aircraft had to be excluded from
the bankruptcy estate unless and until they “are included in a new inventory of
bankruptcy estate” (Exh C-127, p. 3).

On 23 April 2008, the Municipal Court appointed we | as the preliminary trustee
of Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy and ordered him to determine the existence of
Mr Fischer’s assets in the territory of the Czech Republic (Exh R-29, p. 1).

On 9 July 2009, the Municipal Court dismissed a petition for the declaration of
bankruptcy of Mr Fischer as secondary proceedings, concluding that “the Court did
not find sufficient evidence for the existence of the Defendant's establishment within
the meaning of the Regulation” (Exh C-17, p. 3).

On 12 August 2009, the District Court for Prague 2 dismissed AMF’s action for
damages against the Czech Republic (Exh C-29). The Court stated that the Claimant
had not alleged facts enabling a conclusion that it should have been clear
“unambiguously ... that such property should not be included in the bankruptcy
estate,” and that “a subsequent decision of the court which excludes the property” does
not demonstrate malfeasance on account of its not having been excluded earlier (Exh
C-29, p. 8).

On 30 September 2009, AMF filed an appeal against the District Court’s decision of
12 August 2009, which had dismissed AMF’s action for damages (Exh C-30).

On 24 March 2010, the Municipal Court upheld the District Court’s judgment dated
12 August 2019, whereby AMF’s action for damages against the Czech Republic had
been dismissed (Exh C-35). The Court stated there was no malfeasance on account of
the Aircraft not having been excluded at an earlier stage, in circumstances where the
bankruptcy court did not consider the legal issues presented under German law “to be
easy,” and therefore considered it appropriate to maintain the asset in the bankruptcy
estate until the outcome of the exclusion proceedings (Exh C-35, p. 7).

On 30 March 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed AMF’s appeal against the Municipal
Court’s judgment of 24 March 2010 (Exh C-38). The Supreme Court agreed with prior
courts that “the assessment of to whom the aircraft belonged under German law was
not an as:

 

ment which should be carried out as ‘simple’ by the bankruptcy court
outside the initiated exemption proceedings,” which therefore had to run their course
before a definitive exclusion (Exh C-38, p. 29).

On 28 November 2017, the Constitutional Court rejected AMF’s constitutional
complaint against the judgments of the Municipal Court and the Supreme court, dated
24 March 2010 and 30 March 2015, respectively (Exh R-4).

Charter Air’s bankruptcy proceedings

On 13 February 2006, the Regional Court in Prague declared Charter Air bankrupt and
appointed we | as bankruptcy trustee (Exh R-23).

On 23 June 2006, we | included the Aircraft into the bankruptcy estate of Charter
Air, stating that “[t]he reason for their inclusion in the bankruptcy estate is the failure
to fulfil the formal requirements for transfer of the aircraft from the proprietorship of
Charter Air s.r.o. in 1997 to the assets of the current owner pursuant to Section 196a,
Commercial Code, given that consent to such transfer was not granted in particular
by the general meeting of the seller’s company” (Exh C-151, p. 2). ina position
was supported by a legal opinion of Prof Dedic (Exh C-112).

On 29 June 2006, HSH informed we | that the balance of the loan debt secured
by the lien to the Aircraft amounted to USD 32,700,293.03 (Exh C-151, p. 1).

On 26 July 2006, AMF filed an action with the Regional Court in Prague for the
exclusion of the Aircraft from Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate, stating, inter alia, that
AME “is the owner of the aircraft and its ownership title to the aircraft does not admit
the inclusion of the aircraft into the bankruptcy estate of the Bankrupt” (Exh C-113).

On 22 August 2006, we | asked we to obtain AMF’s consent in
order for HSH to submit the relevant documents regarding loans and pledges on the
Aircraft (Exh C-151, p. 1).

On 12 December 2006, the Regional Court in Prague excluded the Aircraft from
Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate, concluding that AMF’s action dated 26 July 2006 is
“legitimate because the plaintiff is the owner of the aircraft specified in the operative
part of the judgement and their inclusion in the bankruptcy estate is incorrect” (Exh
C-109, p. 10 of the pdf).

On 6 February 2007, we | filed an appeal to the High Court against the Regional
Court’s decision dated 12 December 2006, whereby it had excluded the Aircraft from
Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate (Exh C-115).

On 25 September 2007, the High Court partially modified the Regional Court’s
decision dated 12 December 2006, declaring that since the Aircraft were already in the
bankruptcy estate of Mr Fischer, the inclusion of the Aircraft into Charter Air’s
bankruptcy estate had no effects (Exh C-111, p. 5).

On 26 March 2008, after we | had included the Aircraft back into Charter Air’s
bankruptcy estate, AMF filed an action with the Regional Court in Prague to exclude
the Aircraft from Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate (Exh R-30, p. 2 of the pdf).

On 21 May 2008, Charter Air’s creditors, which had been summoned by Mri.
discussed the further procedure in the realisation of the Aircraft (Exh R-40). The
Minutes of the meeting read that “HSH prefers the sale to be performed outside an

auction and intends to actively participate in the sale” (Exh R-40, p. 3). Mia
pointed out that the sale of the Aircraft required AMF’s consent, and the creditors’
committee regarded “this requirement of the bankruptcy trustee as a prerequisite for
further negotiations on sale of the aircraft with participation of HSH Nordbank” (Exh
R-40, p. 4).

On 24 September 2008, Wi | presented information on the planned sale of the
Aircraft in a public auction to the creditors’ committee (Exh R-42, p. 1).

On 22 October 2008, the creditor’s committee informed the Regional Court in Prague
of its disagreement with Mi proposition presented on 24 September 2008,
stating that the creditors’ committee believed that, “if there are doubts as to whether
the very corporeal substance of the aircraft is threatened, the conditions set out in the
provision of Section 19(3) of the Bankruptcy and Settlement Act cannot be deemed
met” (Exh R-42, p. 2).

On 3 November 2008, by order of Mr. Charter Air’s legal representative,
Prof Dedic issued an expert opinion assessing certain legal issues related to the sale of
the Aircraft, concluding that the requirements of Section 19(3) of the Bankruptcy and
Settlement Act had not been fulfilled and that the bankruptcy trustee was not
authorised to monetise the Aircraft with reference to Section 19(3) (Exh C-143, p. 2).

On 17 June 2009, the Regional Court in Prague dismissed AMF’s action to exclude
the Aircraft from Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate, stating that the Aircraft had been
included in the bankruptcy estate legitimately since Purchase Agreement 1 and
Purchase Agreement 2 (together “Purchase Agreements”) were invalid (Exh R-30).

On 27 August 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decision of the High Court of
25 September 2007 (cf. above para. 99), referring the matter to the High Court for
further proceeding (Exh C-110). The Supreme Court declared that “the owner of the
thing may not be denied the right to defend himself against the second inclusion of the
thing in bankruptcy estate” because the inclusion of the “thing” in the bankruptcy
estate constituted a potential interference with the owner’s property rights (Exh C-110,
p. 4).

On 9 September 2009, Mri. working for Air Consulting which had been
commissioned by Mri issued an expert opinion on Aircraft 1, assessing its
current value at USD 1,049,000.00 (Exh C-175).

On 10 September 2009, Mi issued an expert opinion on Aircraft 2, assessing
its current value at USD 1,072,000.00 (Exh C-176).

In both expert opinions dated 9 and 10 September 2009, Mia concluded that
“[t]he surface corrosion found on the aircraft will progress and become honeycomb
corrosion due to weather conditions during the winter season. This will severely
damage parts of the aircraft, engines and electronics and challenge its ability to be
put into operation again” (Exh C-175, p. 19; C-176, p. 13).

On 25 October 2009, in a partial report, we | informed the Regional Court in
Prague that HSH had agreed with the sale of the Aircraft, leaving the form of the sale
up to the bankruptcy trustee (Exh C-174, p. 2).

We report further reads that, on the basis of Mr expert opinion, “the
creditors’ committee stated that the conditions set forth in s. 19(3) of the Bankruptcy
and Compensation Act had been met and agreed with the sale” and that “the creditors
committee decided to sell the aircrafts in an auction” (Exh C-174, p. 2).

 

According to Respondent, on 27 October 2009, the creditors’ committee approved the
conditions of the auction. AMF and HSH did not raise objections (SoD, Annex I, p. 9).

On 29 October 2009, Mri informed AMF and HSH that the sale by auction had
been frustrated by the creditors’ committee (Exh C-148, p. 1). Mri further asked
AMF and HSH to respond to a number of issues, e.g. whether they agreed with the
sale of the Aircraft in a public auction, and asked them to refrain from requesting an
exclusion of the Aircraft from the bankruptcy estate (Exh C-148, p. 2).

On the same day, we | signed a power of attorney, empowering Mia to revoke
or cancel the auction, change its terms and conditions, and participate in the auction
on behalf of Mr (Exh C-139, p. 8 of the pdf).

On _ 12 November 2009, 1. Art Consulting Brno CZ s.r.o. (hereinafter “Art
Consulting”), as the auctioneer, and Mr. acting on behalf of the auction
proponent Mr. signed an auction decree for a voluntary public auction of the
Aircraft (Exh C-139).

On 17 December 2009, the auction took place without any bidders (SoC, para. 60;
SoD, para. 141).

On 28 January 2010, at the motion of Mr. Art Consulting carried out a repeated
voluntary auction, during which the Aircraft were sold to AerSale Inc. for a total price
of USD 2,188,750.00 (Exh C-236).

On 18 February 2010, the High Court annulled the Regional Court’s decision of
17 June 2009, which had dismissed AMF’s action to exclude the Aircraft from Charter
Air’s bankruptcy estate (cf above para. 94), and discontinued the exclusion
proceedings due to /is pendens (Exh R-31).

On 23 March 2010, AMF was deleted and AerSale Inc. was registered as the owner of
the Aircraft in the Aircraft Register of the Czech Republic (Exh C-142). In its decision,
the Civil Aviation Authority also stated that the liens of HSH on the Aircraft ceased to
exist through monetisation of the aircraft in auction (Exh C-142, p. 2).

On 24 November 2010, the High Court modified the Regional Court’s decision of
12 December 2006 (cf: above para. 98), in that the action to exclude the amount
obtained by realising the Aircraft from the bankruptcy estate was dismissed (Exh

R-32). The High Court declared that the Purchase Agreements were invalid because
the procedure under Section 196a (3) of the Commercial Code had not been properly
complied with in the sale of the Aircraft (Exh R-32, p. 11 of the pdf).

On 30 May 2013, the Supreme Court quashed the judgement of the High Court dated
24 November 2010, referring the case back to the High Court for further proceedings
(Exh R-33). The Supreme Court concluded that Section 196a (3) of the Commercial
Code was not applicable and that AMF was the owner of the Aircraft (Exh R-33, p. 4
of the pdf).

On 9 January 2014, the High Court upheld the part of the Regional Court’s judgement
of 12 December 2006 excluding USD 2,048,000.00 obtained through the sale of the
Aircraft from Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate (Exh C-108).

On 27 July 2015, the District Court in Prague closed the bankruptcy proceedings of
Charter Air (Exh C-184).

According to the Respondent, the proceeds of the sale ultimately “were transferred,
with Claimant's consent, to Mr. Fischer’s and Claimant’s financing bank, HSH” (SoD,
para. 369). The Claimant has not disputed this statement.

On 25 August 2017, the District Court of Prague 2 dismissed AMF’s action for
damages in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of Charter Air as
“groundless” (Exh C-137, p. 20). The Court stated that “[b]ased on the evidence the
court has not been satisfied that it would be possible by mere simple reasoning and
determination of law to ascertain whether the Aircraft were owned by plaintiff [...]. It
was necessary to [...] deal with [German law] and there was a reasonable doubt
whether a valid purchase contract had been made” under that law. Further, “it is
necessary to take into account the duty of the receiver to include ... even those [assets]
which it is not clearly obvious whether they belong in the bankruptcy estate or not
[...]. The court believes that the receiver did not err by including the things in the
bankruptcy estate” (Exh C-137, p. 19). With respect to protection of the Aircraft, the
Court concluded that it “has not established any errors on the part of receiver,”
because there were no funds in the estate that could have covered ongoing maintenance
of the Aircraft and the Claimant itself had objected to earlier sale efforts when a higher
price might have been obtained (Exh C-137, p. 20).

On 10 January 2018, upon AMF’s appeal, the Municipal Court upheld the judgement
of the District Court of Prague 2 dated 25 August 2017 (Exh R-S5).

On 27 June 2019, the Supreme Court rejected AMF’s appeal against the Municipal
Court’s decision of 10 January 2018 (Tr 30:17-19).

On 10 September 2018, AMF filed a constitutional complaint seeking annulment of

the Municipal Court’s decision of 10 January 2018 and the resolution of the Supreme
Court of 27 June 2018 (Exh R-69).

Il. The Arbitral Proceedings

The initiation of the proceedings

On 30 November 2016, Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration (hereinafter “RfA”).

On 14 February 2017, the Parties jointly communicated with Professor Stanimir
Alexandrov (appointed as co-arbitrator by Claimant) and Ms. Jean Kalicki (appointed
as co-arbitrator by Respondent), and requested them to proceed with appointment of
the third and presiding arbitrator.

On 21 March 2017, following the conclusion of a process of consultation agreed by
the Parties, the co-arbitrators advised the Parties that they had decided to appoint
Professor Pierre Tercier as President of the Tribunal, subject to his confirmation of
availability and interest.

On 31 March 2017, the co-arbitrators forwarded to the Parties a communication
received from Professor Tercier, and invited them to provide any comments.

On 7 April 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted after both Parties confirmed
Professor Pierre Tercier as the President of the Tribunal.

On 18 April 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal suggested that the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (hereinafter “PCA”) act as Registry.

On 21 April 2017, Respondent agreed with the Arbitral Tribunal’s proposal of
18 April 2017.

On the same day, Claimant refused to engage the PCA.

On 28 April 2017, Claimant provided the Arbitral Tribunal with a German and a Czech
version of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT (hereinafter “Germany-Czech Republic
BIT”).

On 10 May 2017, Claimant provided the Arbitral Tribunal with a corrected German
version of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

On the same day, Respondent also provided the Arbitral Tribunal with a German
version of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

On 16 May 2017, Claimant sent its own proposal concerning the Procedural Timetable
to the Arbitral Tribunal.

On the same day, Respondent provided the Arbitral Tribunal with its own proposal
regarding the Procedural Timetable.

On _ 1 June 2017, Respondent submitted an unofficial English translation of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT to the Arbitral Tribunal.

On 5 June 2017, a first conference call on the organisation of the proceedings was held
between the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties. During the call, Claimant withdrew its
opposition as regards the engagement of the PCA and agreed to the Arbitral Tribunal’s
proposal dated 18 April 2017.

On 14 June 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (hereinafter
“PO 1”). Thereby, it designated Zurich, Switzerland, as the seat of arbitration and

request for a further extension of time to pay its share of the supplementary deposit, to
order the immediate termination of the arbitral proceedings and to decide that Claimant

that the German Supreme Court had set aside the Achmea v Slovak Republic v Achmea
B.V. arbitral award.

decided that if none of the Parties made the requested payment until this deadline, the
Arbitral Tribunal would terminate the arbitral proceedings in conformity with Article
43(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Arbitral Tribunal thus rejected Respondent’s
request for immediate termination of the proceedings.

thereby maintaining PO 4 in force. Referring to Respondent’s email of
9 November 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded PO 7 by inviting the Parties to
refrain from discussing issues concerning the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction or the
merits of the case outside of their submissions.

On 28 December 2018, Claimant informed the Arbitral Tribunal that it did not obtain
funding from HSH to continue the present proceedings. Claimant also indicated its
willingness to enter into settlement negotiations with Respondent, and in case such
negotiations failed, to request the consolidation of the present proceedings with two
other pending arbitral proceedings opposing Claimant and Mr Fischer to Respondent.

On 9 January 2019, based on PO 7, Respondent requested the Arbitral Tribunal to
immediately terminate the arbitral proceedings, in accordance with Article 43(4) of the
UNCITRAL Rules.

On 16 January 2019, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered Procedural Order No. 8 on the
conditional termination of the proceedings (hereinafter “PO 8”). Thereby, the
Arbitral Tribunal ordered the suspension of the proceedings until 13 February 2019
and stated that “[u]nless payment of Claimant’s share of the supplementary deposit
[was] received until this date or the Parties submit a joint request for the continuation
of the proceedings for some other reason, the Arbitral Tribunal [would] terminate the
present proceedings without any further procedural steps.”

Tribunal, commenting on the European Commission’s Application. Claimant objected

opposed to the intervention, provided that the Parties would be given the opportunity
to comment on the Commission’s submissions.

On 5 April 2019, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered Procedural Order No. 10 on the
European Commission’s Application (hereinafter “PO 10”). The Arbitral Tribunal
granted the European Commission’s Application, subject to certain conditions.

Respondent’s Request for Information (hereinafter “PO 11”), ordering Claimant to
reveal the identity of the person or entity that made the payment of Claimant’s share
of the supplementary deposit. The Arbitral Tribunal further ordered Claimant to

for Reconsideration and Security for Costs. The Arbitral Tribunal further rejected

Contracting Party should, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the
parties in dispute.

(2) If the dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date on which it
was officially raised by either party to the dispute, it shall at the request of the
investors of the other Contracting Party, be submitted for arbitration. In the
absence of any other arrangement between the parties to the dispute, the
provisions of article 9, paragraphs 3 to 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis, subject
to the proviso that the appointment of the members of the arbitral tribunal shall
be appointed by the parties to the dispute in accordance with the provisions of

paragraph 3, are not observed, either party to the dispute may, in the absence of
any other arrangement request the Chairman of the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to make the necessary appointments, unless
parties in disputes have not agreed otherwise. The award shall be recognized
and enforced under the Convention of 10 June 1958 on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. [United Nations, Treaty Series, vol.
330, p. 3]

(3) The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not in course of

on the grounds that the investor who is the other party to the dispute has already
received compensation for all or part of his losses under an insurance policy”.

The present arbitral proceedings have the following characteristics:

— The Jaw applicable to the procedure is the UNCITRAL Rules in their 2010
version. If these provisions and rules do not address a specific procedural issue,
the Arbitral Tribunal shall, after consultation with the Parties, determine the
applicable procedure. In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal may seek guidance from,
but shall not be bound by, the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in
International Commercial Arbitration (2010 version) (PO 2 para. 5).

— The law applicable to the merits will be decided in the present award (cf: paras
499-504 below).

The constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal

The constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal has been described above (cf. above paras
132-135). Neither Party has challenged the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.

The arbitral proceedings

The arbitral proceedings have been described in full detail above (cf. above paras 131
et seq).

The Parties had ample opportunity to present their case in the form of several
exchanges of written submissions; as well as at the Hearing.

At the end of the Hearing, the Parties confirmed that they had no objection to the
manner in which the present proceedings were conducted (Tr 172:18-25 and 173:1-2).

of 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules on 19 March 2020.

The Parties’ prayers for relief

Claimant’s prayers for relief

In its last written submission (Reply, p. 28), Claimant requested the following relief
(the numbering in brackets has been added by the Arbitral Tribunal for ease of
reference):

[Claim.

[Claim. 2]

[Claim. 3]

[Claim. 4]

[Claim. 5]

[Claim. 6]

[Claim. 7]

[Claim. 7.1]

[Claim. 7.2]

The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over all claims submitted by
Claimant;

All claims submitted by the Claimant are admissible;

Respondent has breached the standard of just and equitable treatment
under Article 2 (1) BIT;

Respondent has breached the standard of full protection and full
security under Article 2 (3) and 4 (1) BIT in conjunction with Article 2
(3) BIT;

Respondent has breached the standard of non-arbitrary or
discriminatory measures under 2 (2) BIT;

Respondent has subjected the investments and investor to a measure
with effects equivalent to expropriation under article 4 (2) in
conjunction with article 4 (2) of the bilateral investment treaty valid
between Czech Republic and Sweden, as well as Article 6 (4) bilateral
investment treaty valid between Czech Republic and Kuwait;

For the above breaches of its international obligations under BIT,
Respondent shall pay:

material damages in the amount of USD 375,328,861.00 (three
hundred seventy five million three hundred twenty eight thousands eight
hundred sixty one American dollars), of which the principal sum is
USD 190,752,000.00 (one hundred ninety million seven hundred fifty
two thousand American dollars) and interests in the mount of
184,576,861.00 (nine hundred);

Each Party shall bear its own costs of legal representation and the costs
of the arbitrator appointed by it. Both Parties shall share the costs of
the Chairman of the arbitration tribunal equally. While Claimant will
accept to carry its own costs in case of an award in its favour, it won’t
agree to support Respondent's costs in case of an award in favour of
the latter. Should the Arbitral Tribunal decide otherwise, the costs
incurred to Claimant in the amount of 1,127,924.90 EUR should be
borne by Respondent (Claimant's Statement of Cost of 25 September
2019).

In the second part of the Hearing, Claimant withdrew its claim for moral damages (Tr

Respondent’s prayers for relief

In its last written submission (Rejoinder, para.51), Respondent requested the
following relief (the numbering in brackets has been added by the Arbitral Tribunal
for ease of reference):

[Resp. 1] Declare that it has no jurisdiction over Claimant's claims;

[Resp. 2] Alternatively, declare that the Czech Republic has not breached the
Treaty and dismiss all of Claimant’s claims in their entirety; and

[Resp. 3] In any event, order Claimant to fully reimburse the Czech Republic for
the costs it has incurred in defending its interests in this arbitration,
plus interest on any costs at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal.

The issues to be determined and the structure of the Award

In order to decide on the prayers for relief, the Arbitral Tribunal will analyse the issues
raised by the Parties in the following order:

- It will first decide whether it has jurisdiction to hear the present dispute (below
Il);

- It will then determine whether Respondent breached the provisions of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT and whether it is liable for these breaches (below
I);

— Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal will determine and allocate the costs of the present
proceedings (below IV).

For each issue, the Arbitral Tribunal will first summarise the Parties’ positions and
then set forth its analysis. Concerning the summaries of the Parties’ positions, they are
not exhaustive. They present the Parties’ main arguments, in which other arguments
might be subsumed. However, this does not mean that the Arbitral Tribunal did not
consider all of the Parties’ arguments when making its decision.

Il. Jurisdiction

267.

— The Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute because, in accordance
with the Slovak Republic v Achmea B.V. decision (hereinafter “Achmea
decision” or “Achmea judgement”) of the Court of Justice of the European
Union (hereinafter “CJEU”), the arbitration agreement contained in the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT is invalid (cf: below 2);

— the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae over Claimant’s claims
(cf. below 3);

— the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae over Claimant’s claims
(cf. below 4);

— the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimant brought its claims in
bad faith (cf: below 5).

The Arbitral Tribunal will also ascertain whether the Parties agreed to arbitrate the
present dispute (cf: below 6).

Claimant rejects Respondent’s objections to the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The effect of the Achmea decision on the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction

The Parties’ positions
Respondent's position

For Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal must decline jurisdiction because the arbitration
provision in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is precluded by European Union law
(hereinafter “EU law”).

First, Respondent argues that the Arbitral Tribunal is bound by the Achmea judgment,
and must conclude that there exists no valid arbitration agreement between the Parties.

In order to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement, Respondent refers the
Arbitral Tribunal to Article 178(2) of the Swiss Private International Law Act
(hereinafter “PILA”). According to this provision, for an arbitration agreement to be
valid, it must conform either to: (i) the law chosen by the Parties; (ii) the law governing
the subject matter of the dispute; or (iii) Swiss law (SoD, paras 176-178).

In POL, the Parties came to a broad agreement that the law applicable to the dispute is
the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, supplemented by international law. This agreement
should be understood as also applying to the law governing the arbitration agreement.
Once international law governs the arbitration agreement, EU law necessarily applies
as well (SoD, paras 179-181).

40

271.

272.

273.

274.

275.

276.

Investment tribunals have repeatedly affirmed that EU law forms part of international
law (SoD, para. 182). Claimant, having pleaded its treaty claims with reference to the
EU Treaties and CJEU case law, expressly accepts the application of EU law to this
dispute (SoD, paras 183-185). Therefore, in accordance with Article 178(2) PILA, the
Arbitral Tribunal must apply EU law to determine the validity of the arbitration
agreement (SoD, para. 186).

Even if the Arbitral Tribunal were to apply Swiss law to the validity of the arbitration
agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot ignore the role of international law in the
formation of the arbitration agreement. The offer to arbitrate is contained in an
international treaty between States, governed exclusively by international law (SoD,
para. 187).

In line with the Achmea judgment, the Czech Republic’s offer to arbitrate contained in
the Germany-Czech Republic BIT was invalidated when the Czech Republic became
a Member State of the EU in 2004. In essence, the Achmea judgment considers that
EU law, applied as international law between the Contracting States, can affect a
State’s capacity to consent to arbitration, thereby impacting even the jurisdiction of
tribunals established outside the EU legal order (SoD, paras 188-192). The fact that
Advocate General Wathelet considered the arbitration provisions in Intra-EU BITs to
be compatible with EU law is irrelevant, since his opinion has no legal force and was
not followed in the Achmea judgement (SoD, para. 163; Rejoinder, para. 35).

The Achmea judgment created a conflict between Article 10 of the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the functioning of the
European Union (hereinafter “TFEU”). Applying the relevant conflict rules, be it
those of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties (hereinafter “VCLT”) or
Article 351 of the TFEU, the conclusion is the same: Article 10 of the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT is incompatible with a subsequent treaty, the TFEU, and became
inapplicable as of the Czech Republic’s accession to the EU in 2004 (Tr 68:12-25).

The Achmea judgment is not about applicable law, but about the fundamental
principles of EU law: mutual trust and sincere cooperation. The reference to the
applicable law in the judgment has to be understood in this broader context, as the
CJEU itself explains in paragraph 56 of the judgment (Tr 137, 138 and 139:1-11).

Respondent also notes that, in January 2019, all EU Member States, including
Germany and the Czech Republic declared arbitration clauses contained in intra-EU
BITs to be inapplicable (Rejoinder, para. 38). Pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, this
declaration constitutes a subsequent agreement between the Parties regarding the
interpretation of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT or the application of its provisions
or subsequent practice in the application of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, which
establishes the agreement of the Parties regarding its interpretation (Tr 68:17-25).

286.

Therefore, when Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration in 2016, there was no
offer to arbitrate for Claimant to accept. Accordingly, no valid arbitration agreement
could have been concluded between the Parties (SoD, para. 193).

This approach is upheld even though these arbitration proceedings are seated outside
the EU, because this is a pure question of international law (SoD, para. 191).

Second, and in the alternative, Respondent claims that, due to the Achmea judgement,
the subject matter of the dispute cannot be validly submitted to arbitration.

Even if the Arbitral Tribunal were to consider EU law not a part of international law,
EU law is nevertheless applicable to this dispute. EU law forms part of both Czech and
German law, and the Parties agreed in PO | that these laws would govern the present
dispute (SoD, para. 194). Contrary to what Claimant alleges in its SoC, it does not treat
EU law as a mere fact, but invokes it as a more favourable law to plead its treaty claims
(SoD, para. 195).

Arbitrability, i.e. whether a dispute is capable of resolution by arbitration, is a
prerequisite to the validity of the arbitration agreement and, therefore, the jurisdiction
of the Arbitral Tribunal. The question of arbitrability is governed by the /ex arbitri.
For a tribunal with seat in Switzerland, the relevant legal provisions are Articles 19
and 177(1) PILA. Despite the broad formulation of these provisions, an arbitral
tribunal seated in Switzerland may restrict the notion of arbitrability in the presence of
foreign law when such law constitutes a mandatory rule (SoD, paras 196-198; Tr
69:19-23).

In the Tensaccai v Freysinnet case, the Swiss Federal Tribunal decided that EU law
constitutes such mandatory foreign law under the “shared-values” test established by
the Federal Tribunal. An arbitral tribunal seated in Switzerland must apply the relevant
foreign mandatory rule when a party invokes EU law (SoD, paras 202-206).

Therefore, it follows from the Tensaccai v Freysinnet judgment that the Arbitral
Tribunal must apply the foreign mandatory rule established in the Achmea judgment
according to which the arbitration provision contained in Article 10 of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT is precluded by EU law.

The Arbitral Tribunal must conclude that this dispute is inarbitrable under Article
177(1) PILA, and that there is no valid arbitration agreement between the Parties.

Third, and in any event, Respondent argues that the Arbitral Tribunal should decline
jurisdiction out of comity for the Achmea judgement.

Comity is a principle of judicial restraint, founded on mutual respect for the integrity
and competence of tribunals. International tribunals generally exercise comity either
by (i) suspending one legal proceeding pending resolution of another; or (ii) giving
legal relevance to judgments by other courts and international tribunals, once rendered

42

287.

288.

289.

290.

291.

2.1.2

292.

293.

294.

295.

(SoD, paras 210-216). Based on this, Respondent considers that the Arbitral Tribunal
should exercise comity towards the Achmea judgment and decline jurisdiction.

If the Arbitral Tribunal forced the Czech Republic to arbitrate, the latter would be
bound by contradictory obligations or decisions. As a Member State of the EU, the
Czech Republic is bound by the Achmea judgment. It would violate its obligations
under EU law if it were forced to arbitrate the merits of the present dispute (SoD,
para. 218).

Moreover, it would be unreasonable and inappropriate for the Arbitral Tribunal to
exercise jurisdiction because this would undermine the CJEU’s authority to have the
last word on the interpretation of EU law, in particular, since the Arbitral Tribunal
decided to seat these proceedings outside the EU (SoD, para. 219; Rejoinder, para. 37).

Disregarding the Achmea judgement would not efficiently resolve litigation. If this
Arbitral Tribunal ignored the Achmea judgement, it would create uncertainty as to
which fora are available to resolve intra-EU investment disputes (SoD, para. 220).

Finally, Respondent never argued that intra-EU BITs had been automatically
terminated, but rather that the arbitration clauses contained in the BITs were contrary
to Union law and thus inapplicable (Respondent’s letter dated 26 November 2019).

Consequently, Respondent requests the Arbitral Tribunal to follow the Achmea
judgement and, as a result, to decline jurisdiction.

Claimant’s position

For Claimant, the Achmea judgement has no impact on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal.

Claimant considers that whether or not an award is enforceable is not a matter to be
decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, and any award may be issued without regard to the
Achmea decision (Reply, para. 125). In any event, the award rendered by the Arbitral
Tribunal will not be unenforceable. Even Advocate General Wathelet spoke in favour
of the validity of arbitration clauses in Intra-EU BITs (Reply, para. 126).

Claimant also expresses doubts as to “whether an arbitration provision in a treaty
between an EU member state and a non-member state, which must be assumed as valid
in light of the ECJ (CJEU] jurisprudence, might be discriminatory against investors
from EU member states, when precluding them from the right that a non-EU investor
may enjoy” (Reply, para. 127).

Claimant further states that, since the Arbitral Tribunal is seated outside the EU, the
award will never be reviewed by the CJEU (Reply, para. 128). Moreover, as long as
the Treaty has not been terminated, the arbitration clause contained therein remains
valid, notwithstanding the Achmea judgment or any declaration by EU governments.

The Germany-Czech Republic BIT is a binding contract between the two States, and
not only its conclusion but its termination also has to be submitted to the approval of
the national parliaments (Reply, para. 129; Tr 111:10-19).

The January 2019 Declarations are a mere interpretation exercise made by its
Signatories, and concern only the future legal consequences of the Achmea judgment.
In particular, by stating that intra-EU BITs will be terminated, the Signatories admit
that these treaties have not been automatically terminated due to the Achmea judgment
(Claimant’s letter dated 12 November 2019).

Therefore, despite the Achmea judgement, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear
the present dispute.

Non-disputing party’s position

The European Commission submitted an amicus curiae brief on 29 April 2019,
explaining that the Arbitral Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the present dispute in
light of the Achmea judgment, as the offer of the Czech Republic to investors from
Germany to enter into investment arbitration contained in the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT was invalidated with the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU in
2004 (Amicus Brief, para. 1).

The European Commission points specifically to two consequences of the Achmea
judgment.

First, the findings of the Achmea judgment apply to all intra-EU BITs. The purpose of
the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU is to give a binding
interpretation of EU law and not to decide the case before it. Indeed, the preliminary
ruling procedure is the keystone of uniform interpretation and application of EU law
(Amicus Brief, paras 5 and 23).

Moreover, the operative part of the judgment refers to “a provision in an international
agreement concluded between Member States” (Amicus Brief, para. 27).

The above is confirmed by the interpretative declarations issued by the EU Members
States on 15 and 16 January 2019, pursuant to Articles 31(2)(b) and 31(3)(a) of the
VCLT on the legal consequences of the Achmea judgment and on investment
protection in the EU (hereinafter “the January Declarations”; Amicus Brief, paras
21-22). The January Declarations were signed both by Germany and the Czech
Republic, and all declarations are identical insofar as the legal effects of the Achmea
judgment for intra-EU BITs are concerned (Amicus Brief, para. 13).

The Achmea judgment further establishes that the general principle of autonomy of
EU law and Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union as well as Articles 267 and
344 preclude any intra-EU investment arbitration.

44

304.

305.

306.

307.

308.

309.

310.

Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union obliges the Member States to provide
sufficient remedies to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by EU law.
Together with the remedies provided for in the Treaties, a complete system of judicial
protection is thereby ensured, which protects the integrity of the EU legal order
(Amicus Brief, para. 4).

Arbitral tribunals established under intra-EU BITs do not form part of the judicial
system of the EU and cannot be regarded as courts of the Member States within the
meaning of Article 267 TFEU. As such, they cannot make reference to the CJEU for
preliminary ruling, which calls into question the principle of mutual trust between
Member States and the preservation of the nature of EU law, and thus the autonomy
of EU law (Amicus Brief, para. 24). The principle of mutual trust is based on the
fundamental premise that each Member State shares with all the other Member States,
and recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which the EU is
founded, as stated in Article 2 TFEU (Amicus Brief, para. 7).

The objective of Article 267 is reinforced by Article 344 TFEU, which prohibits
Member States from creating, in relation to any matter implicating EU law, dispute
settlement mechanisms other than those set out in the EU Treaties (Amicus Brief,
para. 5).

CJEU judgments contain a binding and authoritative interpretation of the relevant
provisions of EU law for all Member States and any investors established in the
Member States. These judgments are also binding, as part of international law
applicable to the dispute and upon intra-EU arbitral tribunals (Amicus Brief, para. 26).

Second, the effects of the Achmea judgment apply ex tunc, since 1 May 2004. The
decisions of the CJEU only interpret the law and do not create new law. Therefore, the
conflict between the Germany-Czech Republic BIT and EU law has existed since
1 May 2004, the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU. As such, consent to
arbitration was lacking ab initio. This was confirmed by the January Declarations
(Amicus Brief, paras 28-29).

The Commission further states, and the January Declarations confirm, that EU law
takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States.
To the extent there is a TFEU-based exception to this rule, it is limited in scope: Article
351(1) TFEU only protects rights of third States, but not rights of Member States. Such
primacy also applies to international treaties that have been concluded between a
Member State and another Member State, which acceded to the EU only after the
conclusion of that agreement, as of the day of accession (Amicus Brief, paras 32-35).

As a matter of public international law, the starting point is to apply the special conflict
tule of EU law, namely primacy of EU law vis-a-vis other international agreements
concluded between Member States. The rule in Article 30 (3) to (5) of the VCLT was
conceived as residual (Amicus Brief, paras 36-37 and 39).

45

311.

312.

313.

314.

315.

316.

317.

EU law is based on the general principle of its primacy over not only the domestic
laws of Member States, but also over international treaties concluded between two
Member States. It is an unwritten element of primary EU law, at the same rank in the
hierarchy of norms as the TFEU itself. It is closely linked to the unity of the EU legal
order, without which this latter would not be able to function as such (Amicus Brief,
paras 6 and 38-39).

In any event, the application of the conflict rules between successive treaties as
enshrined in Articles 59 and 30 of the VCLT would lead to the same result (Amicus,
Brief, para. 40).

Article 59 of the VCLT provides for two scenarios in which the conclusion of a
successive treaty gives rise ex /ege to the implied termination of an existing treaty
(Amicus Brief, para. 42).

The first is based on the intention of the Contracting Parties. The types of investments
listed in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT fall within the ambit of the EU internal
market rules. EU law provides for a complete set of legal remedies and effective
judicial protection in the event of a violation of those substantive rules. When signing
the EU accession treaty of the Czech Republic, both Contracting Parties were aware
of the rule of primacy of EU law. Their intention, when signing the accession treaty,
was that the protection of intra-EU investments would be governed from that moment
by EU law rather than the Germany-Czech Republic BIT (Amicus Brief, paras 43-44).

The second concerns the incompatibility between the two treaties. The incompatibility
of the arbitration clause contained in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT with EU law
has been demonstrated above. The incompatibility between the substantive provisions
of the treaties is such that they are not capable of being applied at the same time. The
substantive rules of intra-EU BITs constitute a parallel system overlapping with Single
Market rules, and which prevent the full application of EU law. This is illustrated by
awards that constitute illegal State aid or by the fact that intra-EU BITs confer rights
only in respect of investors from one of the two Member States concerned, in conflict
with the EU principle of non-discrimination on the ground of nationality (Amicus
Brief, para. 45). In any event, Article 59 can lead to a partial termination of an
international agreement, if one considers that only the arbitration agreement contained
in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is incompatible with EU law (Amicus Brief,
para. 46).

The requirement of the same subject matter is automatically met when one of the two
above-mentioned scenarios apply. In any event, the test is whether the two treaties
govern the same legal situation, which is met in the present case: any investment made
by an investor from one Member State in another Member State falls under the scope
of application of the EU internal market rules (Amicus Brief, para. 48).

Even if there was no implicit termination in the present case, Article 30(3) of the VCLT
would still apply in the present case. It applies to all situations where there is a conflict,

46

318.

319.

320.

321.

2.2

322.

323.

324.

direct or indirect, between the earlier and the later treaty. In this context, “conflict” and
“same subject matter” are one and the same thing in this context (Amicus Brief, paras
49-53).

In addition, according to the January Declarations, sunset or grandfathering clauses do
not produce any effects. They only relate to the unilateral termination of the BIT by
one Contracting Party. The Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic to the EU
reflects the common will of all contracting parties. These clauses breach EU law for
the same reasons as the offer of arbitration contained in intra-EU BITs (Amicus Brief,
paras 54-55).

Investment tribunals have held that the law applicable to the merits should apply to
jurisdiction as well, and that in an intra-EU investment arbitration EU law was part of
the law applicable to deciding issues related to jurisdiction. As EU law takes
precedence due to the principle of its primacy, the Arbitral Tribunal should deny
jurisdiction in light of the Achmea decision (Amicus Brief, paras 56-58).

The alternative view that might be taken by the Arbitral Tribunal is that the law
applicable to the assessment of the existence and validity of offers for arbitration under
the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is international law (Amicus Brief, para. 59). EU
law precludes the offer for arbitration in the BIT, and the resulting conflict between
EU law and Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT has to be resolved in
favour of EU law both as a matter of EU law and public international law. Therefore,
no valid arbitration agreement was concluded between the Parties (Amicus Brief, paras
59-60).

Finally, any award rendered in favour of Claimant could not be enforced, as Member
States’ courts are under the obligation to annul any arbitral award rendered on the basis
of an intra-EU BIT and to refuse to enforce it (Amicus Brief, para. 62).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Before analysing the merits of the objection, the Arbitral Tribunal will deal with
Claimant’s objection concerning the admissibility of the Amicus Brief.

Claimant considered, in its letter dated 12 November 2019, that the Arbitral Tribunal
should disregard entirely the European Commission’s Amicus Brief due to its late
submission to the Parties for comments on 21 October 2019 (cf. the Arbitral Tribunal’s
letter to the Parties dated 21 October 2019).

The Arbitral Tribunal communicated the Amicus Brief and its Annexes to the Parties
on 21 October 2019, and gave the Parties until 12 November 2019 to make a first round
of comments to the brief and then until 26 November 2019 to answer to the other
Parties’ position (cf. the Arbitral Tribunal’s letter to the Parties dated
21 October 2019).

327.

328.

329.

2.21

(a)

330.

331.

(b)

332.

Given the short length of the Amicus Brief, only twenty pages, as well as the fact that
the arguments contained therein were raised by Respondent in its submissions or have
been publicly communicated and defended by the European Commission, five weeks
seems sufficient time for the Parties to elaborate their positions. In addition, the
proceedings had not yet been closed at the time.

If it needed more time, Claimant could have asked for an extension of the deadline.
Instead, Claimant chose to contest the admissibility of the Amicus Brief three weeks
after it received the document, i.e. on 12 November 2019, when the first rounds of
comments were due.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimant had full opportunity to review and
respond to the Amicus Brief, but decided not to make use of its right.

In any event, the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal took the Amicus Brief into account
does not change the outcome of the case, since the Arbitral Tribunal rejects all the
arguments the European Commission raised (cf: section 2.2.1 below).

The Arbitral Tribunal will first analyse the validity of the arbitration agreement (cf.
2.2.1 below) and will then address the issues of arbitrability (cf 2.2.2 below) and
comity (cf. 2.2.3 below).

The validity of the arbitration agreement

The law applicable to the validity of the arbitration agreement

As a preliminary issue, the law applicable to the jurisdiction of the present Arbitral
Tribunal has to be established, which is distinct from the law that governs the merits
of the dispute (cf. in this sense Vattenfall v Germany, Annex EC-01, para. 109; Wirtgen
v Czech Republic, Exh RL-25, para. 156; Amicus Brief, para. 59).

The offer to arbitrate is contained in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, which is an
instrument of international law. Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal shall examine
whether Article 10 of the BIT contains a valid offer to arbitrate under international
law. Nothing in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT indicates otherwise.

Whether Article 10 contains a valid offer to arbitrate when interpreted according to
Article 31 of the VCLT

Art 10 is a provision contained in bilateral investment treaty concluded between two
States that has to be interpreted according to Art 31 of the VCLT, both the Czech
Republic and Germany being signatories to this treaty. This provision reads as follows:

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of
its object and purpose.

48

333.

334.

335.

336.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in
addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties
in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with
the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument
related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation
of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between
the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties
so intended.

When interpreted in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, Article 10 constitutes
an unambiguous offer to arbitrate, which, in particular in light of the Arbitral
Tribunal’s findings concerning the other aspects of its jurisdiction (cf: below sections
3, 4, 5, and 6), encompasses the present dispute.

Contrary to the European Commission’s and Respondent’s position, the January 2019
Declarations cannot change this conclusion, as they do not fall under either Article
31(2) or 31(3) of the VCLT.

The Germany-Czech Republic BIT entered into force on 2 August 1992, and the
January 2019 Declarations were signed some seventeen years later. Therefore, they do
not constitute agreements or instruments which “were made in connection with the
conclusion” of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT. Given their ex post facto nature,
they cannot possibly assist in determining the context for interpreting the original
intent of the Contracting Parties under Article 31(2) of the VCLT.

Moreover, the January 2019 Declarations cannot be considered “subsequent
agreement(s] between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the
application of its provisions” under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT. The January 2019
Declarations are more expressions of the political will of EU Members States to
comply with their obligations flowing from EU law as interpreted and defined by the
Achmea Judgment (January 2019 Declaration, Exh R-66, p. 1). To this effect, they

49

337.

338.

(o)

339.

340.

341.

declare that they will, in the future, undertake a number of actions concerning intra-EU
BITs and pending related arbitrations (Exh R-66, pp. 3-4).

In any event, the kind of interpretative declaration described in Article 31(3)(a) of the
VCLT may only specify or clarify the meaning or scope attributed to the treaty by the
Contracting States, but it cannot modify treaty obligations. Given the wording and
structure of Article 31 of the VCLT, an interpretative declaration may only constitute
one element to be taken into account together with the context when interpreting the
treaty in accordance with the general rules of interpretation enshrined in Article 31. It
cannot however override the meaning revealed by the terms of the treaty.
Consequently, the January 2019 Declarations could not retroactively invalidate Article
10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT and the clearly formulated offer to arbitrate
contained therein.

Even if the Arbitral Tribunal accepted that the January 2019 Declarations constituted
subsequent agreements to interpret or apply intra-EU BITs, it cannot accept that they
should be given retroactive effect to require the termination of the present arbitration
proceedings. These latter were initiated in good faith before the issuance of the January
2019 Declarations, and even before the rendering of the Achmea judgment. The
fundamental principle of acquired rights does not permit States to deprive investors of
their right to arbitration under a long-standing BIT mid-way through the arbitration by
simply issuing an interpretative declaration. This is all the more true, since the January
2019 Declarations reveal that its signatories themselves do not believe that intra-EU
BITs have been terminated, and consider that further future action is necessary to
achieve this result (R-66, p. 4, point 5).

Whether Article 10 is inapplicable to the present dispute by operation of Articles 30
or 59 of the VCLT

Article 26 of the VCLT incorporates the customary international law principle of pacta
sunt servanda and provides that “[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to
it and must be performed by them in good faith.” This means that a treaty, and its
provisions, remain in force until terminated following the procedures set out in the
VCLT. The Germany-Czech Republic BIT has not been terminated or suspended
either expressly, or impliedly by the Contracting States.

None of the Parties nor the European Commission invoked the articles of the VCLT
which govern the express termination and suspension of treaties by Contracting States.
The January 2019 Declarations cannot be interpreted as terminating the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT, as they only contemplate the termination of intra-EU
BITs as a prospective action to be taken in the future (R-66, p. 4, point 8).

However, the European Commission argues that the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is
inapplicable by the operation of Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT. Respondent also
makes reference to the first of these conflict rules in passing (cf. para. 274 above).

Article 30 of the VCLT provides in relevant parts as follows:

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and
obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same
subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following
paragraphs.

be]

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but
the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59,
the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible
with those of the later treaty.

Article 59 of the VCLT provides in relevant parts as follows:

1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a
later treaty relating to the same subject-matter and:

(a) It appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties
intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or

(b) The provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the
earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same
time.

Article 59 of the VCLT deals with the implied termination or suspension of a treaty
by the conclusion of a later treaty. Article 30 concerns the application of successive
treaties relating to the same subject matter, and the operation of which was not
terminated or suspended in accordance with Article 59. Both provisions apply only to
treaties that relate to the same subject matter. If this condition is not fulfilled, Articles
30 and 59 of the VCLT cannot be given effect.

In this respect, the European Commission’s argument that the requirement of the same
subject matter does not constitute a separate condition under Articles 30 and 59 of the
VCLT, does not withstand scrutiny.

(i) Conditions of application under Article 59 of the VCLT

Concerning Article 59 of the VCLT, the European Commission relies on Judge
Anzilotti’s Dissenting Opinion in the Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria case
(Annex EC-21), claiming that, since Judge Anzelotti did not use the terms “same
subject matter” and that Article 59 codifies the principles developed by him, such a
criterion should not be applied. However, the European Commission did not provide
any authorities to sustain its position nor further explanation as to why it considers that
Article 59 was drafted by exclusive reliance on Judge Anzelotti’s Dissenting Opinion.

51

347.

348.

349.

350.

351.

352.

Moreover, even if the European Commission’s position was correct, Judge Anzelotti’s
Dissenting Opinion supports the Arbitral Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 59 of the
VCLT. First, Judge Anzelotti could not have used the exact terms “same subject
matter’, as his Dissenting Opinion predates the conclusion of the VCLT. Second, a
close reading of his reasoning shows that he did consider a situation where two treaties
“lay down different rules for the same thing”, with the “same thing” being recourse to
the Permanent Court of Justice (Annex EC-21, p. 29). He then further specifies that,
“in the same legal system, there cannot at the same time exist two rules relating to the
same facts and attaching to these facts contradictory consequences” (Annex EC-21,
p. 30). Judge Anzelotti’s Dissenting Opinion thus clearly considers two distinct
conditions, without any indication that one could absorb the other.

The European Commission essentially asks the Arbitral Tribunal to disregard the
express wording of the VCLT agreed upon by the contracting States and thus to rewrite
the text of the treaty. The terms “same subject matter” figure in paragraph | of Article
59 of the VCLT and are preconditions to the application of this provision. In
accordance with the principle of effectiveness (effet utile), the Arbitral Tribunal cannot
ignore the ordinary meaning of the terms contained in paragraph 1, and is required to
give them some meaning rather than none.

(ii) Conditions of application under Article 30 of the VCLT

Concerning Article 30(3) of the VCLT, the European Commission adopts a similar
position. In its view, Article 30 does not contain two conditions of its applicability, but
only one, since “‘‘the same subject matter’ and ‘conflict’ are one and the same thing
in this context” (Amicus Brief, para. 51).

However, textually, Article 30 of the VCLT refers to the requirement that the
successive treaties are related to the same subject matter both in its title and in its first
paragraph. This latter constitutes a threshold provision, which is expressly stated to be
a condition for the rest of Article 30 of the VCLT to apply. Once again, the Arbitral
Tribunal cannot rewrite the text of the treaty, and it must give effect to the ordinary
meaning of the terms used by its signatories.

Moreover, it is impossible to consider that the requirement of incompatibility between
the provisions of two treaties set out in Article 30(3) of the VCLT alone is sufficient
to trigger the application of Article 30. This is because Article 30(1) examines the
relationship between treaties as a whole, whereas Article 30(3) refers to the
relationship between provisions contained in treaties relating to the same subject
matter.

Finally, the European Commission has offered limited support for its interpretation of
Article 30 of the VCLT. It essentially relies on the International Law Commission’s
(hereinafter “ILC”) drafting history of Article 30 of the VCLT. The European
Commission explains that the ILC Draft of 1964 of what was then Article 63 had the

52

353.

354.

355.

356.

357.

following wording: “[...] the obligation of States parties to treaties, the provisions of
which are incompatible, shall be determined in accordance with the following
paragraphs”. It was only later that the terms “the provisions of which are
incompatible” were replaced by “relating to the same subject matter’.

The accompanying commentary explains the change as follows:

On re-examining the article at the present session the Commission felt that,
although the rules may have particular importance in cases of incompatibility,
they should be stated more generally in term of the application of successive
treaties to the same subject- matter. One advantage of this formulation of the
rules, it thought, would be that it would avoid any risk of [the provision] being
interpreted _as ioning the concl of a_ treaty inc ible_with

bli; undertaken _towards another State under _ another _ treaty.
Consequently, while the substance of the article remains the same as in the 1964
text, its wording has been revised in the manner indicated. (Annex EC-24,
p. 232, emphasis added).

Even if the Arbitral Tribunal accepted that this commentary can be used as a
supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT, it still does not
help the European Commission’s case. The commentary demonstrates that there was
a specific reason behind adding the terms “related to the same subject matter”, which
serve a purpose and cannot thus simply be disregarded.

As to the other authority the European Commission invokes, it does not support its
position either. The Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission
on the Fragmentation of International Law does not advocate for disregarding the
criterion of “same subject matter’’. On the contrary, it acknowledges that Article 30 of
the VCLT approaches the issue of conflict from the perspective of the subject matter
of the relevant rules (Annex EC-18, paras 21 and 23).

In light of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal will first examine whether the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT and the TFEU can be considered to relate to the same
subject matter as a condition to the application of both Articles 30 and 59 VCLT.

(iii) Whether the Germany-Czech Republic BIT relate to the same subject-matter

As a first step, the Arbitral Tribunal has to give meaning to the terms “related to the
same subject matter’, as the VCLT does not define them. In this respect, the Arbitral
Tribunal agrees with the findings of the EURAM v Slovak Republic case. The good
faith interpretation of Article 30 VCLT does not support the conclusion that two
treaties relate to the same subject matter only because they apply simultaneously to the
same set of facts, or as the European Commission argues, to the same legal situation.
Two treaties might both apply to the same set of facts or even share broadly stated
goals, but they can still approach the achievement of those goals from different
perspectives (EURAM v Slovak Republic, Exh RL-39, paras 168-171). Therefore, as

53

358.

359.

360.

361.

362.

363.

(d)

364.

the EURAM v Slovak Republic tribunal put it: “the subject matter of a treaty is inherent
in the treaty itself and refers to the issues with which its provisions deal, i.e. its topic
or its substance” (Exh RL-39, para. 172).

The topic or subject of the EU treaties is to promote economic integration and to create
and maintain a common market among the Member States; whereas the topic or
substance of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is to provide for specific guarantees in
order to encourage the international flows of investment into the Contracting States.

The substantive protections afforded to a foreign investor under the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT are not comparable to, or of the same nature as, those offered under the
EU treaties. For example, the FET standard is not coextensive with the fundamental
EU freedoms, and EU law does not specifically forbid treatment that is not fair and
equitable. It is true that existing EU law provisions prohibit discrimination, but the
protections afforded by the FET standard go beyond the prohibition of discrimination.

Neither Respondent nor the EU Commission have even attempted to establish that the
EU treaties would offer comparable protections to those available under the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT. In sum, the relevant provisions of EU law guaranteeing
fundamental freedoms or prohibiting discrimination do not have the same “topic or
substance” as the substantive protections provided under the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT.

The potential simultaneous application of EU law and the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT to the same set of facts or that they both might afford protection to the same
investors under certain circumstances is not sufficient to conclude that they relate to
the same subject matter.

Given these conclusions, there is no need for the Arbitral Tribunal to examine the other
conditions of application of Article 30 and 59 VCLT, which apply cumulatively.

As a final remark, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot accept the European Commission’s
suggestion that the principle of primacy of EU law is the primary conflict rule to be
relied upon when it comes to the relationship of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT and
the TFEU. The relationship between successive treaties is exclusively governed by
international law, and in particular the VCLT, to which both Germany and the Czech
Republic are parties.

Whether Article 10 is precluded by EU law in light of the Achmea judgment

The Arbitral Tribunal wishes to emphasise at the outset that it offers no criticism of
the Achmea judgment as such, and it accepts that the judgments of the CJEU constitute,
in the EU legal order, binding interpretations of the EU law issues they deal with.

54

365.

366.

367.

368.

370.

371.

(i) | The Achmea judgment’s findings

The Arbitral Tribunal must first establish whether the Achmea judgment’s findings,
from the standpoint of EU law, even reach the arbitration agreement contained in
Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Contrary to Respondent’s position, the Achmea judgment is centred around the
question of applicable law, the main concern and rationale underlying the CJEU’s
decision being to ensure the full effectiveness of EU law (cf in this sense Exh RL-9,
paras 39, 42, 50, 55, 56 and 58)

The starting point of the CJEU’s analysis was to ascertain whether the disputes
submitted to the arbitral tribunal under the relevant provision in the BIT in question
were “liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law” (Exh RL-9,
para. 39). In this respect, the CJEU observed that EU law “must be regarded both as
forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an
international agreement between Member States” (RL-9, para. 41). This dual nature
of EU law resulted in the fact that under the terms of the arbitration agreement
contained in the BIT at issue before the CJEU, the arbitral tribunal could have been
called upon to interpret or apply EU law as part of either “the law in force of the
Contracting Party concerned” or “other relevant agreements between the Contracting
Parties” (Exh RL-9, para. 4). Importantly, the CJEU did not consider a third basis for
applying EU law, albeit specifically mentioned in the BIT (Exh RL-9, para. 4), namely
the general principles of international law.

Nothing in the Achmea judgment suggests that EU Member States were prohibited to
offer arbitration under intra-EU BITs not governed even in part by EU law, but only
by express treaty provisions and by general principles of international law. The CJEU
did not consider that EU law could form part of either of these sources.

This is a very important distinction, since the Germany-Czech Republic BIT does not
contain an applicable law clause comparable to the one in the BIT at issue in Achmea.
In fact, it does not contain an applicable law clause at all.

(ii) Whether EU law may be applied to the present dispute under the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT

At the time when PO 1 was rendered, the Parties disagreed on the applicability of EU
law to the present dispute; Respondent considering that EU law applied as part of
international law and Claimant opposing to this proposition. The Arbitral Tribunal had
decided to rule upon this issue once it received the Parties’ full submissions (PO 1,
p. 9).

Contrary to Respondent’s position, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that
Claimant, by virtue of the references it makes to EU law in its Statement of Claim (cf.

55

372.

373.

374.

375.

376.

377.

the list in SoD, paras 184-185), would have accepted that EU law applies as part of
international law to the merits of the present dispute.

The Arbitral Tribunal recalls that international law is composed of different legal
sub-systems that co-exist without there being a hierarchy between the norms of each
sub-system. As a whole, international law together with its sub-systems is bound by
general principles of international law, i.e. by customary international law. EU law is
one of the sub-systems of international law, which co-exists with other sub-systems,
such as international investment law, including bilateral investment treaties. EU law
thus does not form part of general international law displacing all other sub-systems
of international law.

The CJEU itself confirmed the sui generis nature of the EU legal order, which
manifests itself in the autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member
States and to international law. The CJEU considers that this autonomy is justified by
“the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the
constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that law” (Exh RL-9,
para. 33). EU law is thus a regional sub-system of law, different and separate from
general international law and other sub-systems of international law.

Therefore, when a bilateral investment treaty, such as the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT, remains silent as to the applicable law to disputes arising under it, it cannot be
considered that the Contracting States, one of which was not even a Member State of
the EU at the time of the conclusion of the BIT, intended for EU law, a regional
sub-system of international law, to apply to the disputes under the BIT.

Consequently, the disputes that can be submitted to arbitration pursuant Article 10 of
the Germany-Czech Republic BIT must be decided in accordance with the provisions
of the BIT itself and general principles of international law. This however does not
mean that the present Arbitral Tribunal could not consider EU law as a matter of fact
if potentially relevant to the merits.

(iii) Whether the Achmea judgment binds the present Arbitral Tribunal

Even if the Achmea judgment’s conclusions encompassed the arbitration agreement in
Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, the Achmea judgment still cannot
bind the present Arbitral Tribunal constituted under a bilateral investment treaty.

The present Arbitral Tribunal is constituted under an international treaty, the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT. As such, it operates on the plane of the international
legal order and in a public international law context, not in a regional or national
context (cf in this sense Electrabel v Hungary, Exh RL-16, para. 4.112). The CJEU,
as an institution belonging to the EU legal order, operates on the level of that order,
and its judgments are binding within that legal order. The Report of the Study Group
of the International Law Commission on the Fragmentation of International Law
considers that “when conflicts emerge between treaty provisions that have their home

56

378.

379.

380.

381.

382.

in different regimes, care should be taken so as to guarantee that any settlement is not
dictated by organs exclusively linked with one of the other of the conflicting regimes”
(Annex EC-18, p. 252).

Therefore, a tribunal situated on the international plane, such as the present Arbitral
Tribunal, is not bound by the position adopted by the CJEU, which is a court within a
regional sub-system of international law.

(iv) The Contracting Parties did not invalidate any provisions of the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT in accordance with the relevant provisions of the VCLT

Even accepting that the Achmea judgment could bind the present Arbitral Tribunal, it
cannot automatically invalidate Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT. The
principle of pacta sunt servanda enshrined in Article 26 VCLT implies that a judgment
of the CJEU cannot by itself put an end to the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.
According to Article 42 of the VCLT, “[t]he validity of a treaty or of the consent of a
State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the
present Convention”.

Therefore, if States wish to invalidate provisions of a treaty that is in force, they have
to follow certain procedures that are set out in Articles 46 through 53 of the VCLT.
Among these grounds, only Article 46 could conceivably have been invoked in the
present case, which reads as follows:

1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has
been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding
competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation
was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.

2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State
conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good
faith.

However, the conditions laid down by Article 46 of the VCLT are not fulfilled in the
present case. Article 46 of the VCLT specifies that provisions of a State’s internal law
may not be invoked in order to invalidate its consent to be bound by a treaty, unless
the violation of internal law was manifest and concerned a rule of fundamental
importance. Further, Article 46 defines “manifest” as “objectively evident to any State
conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.”

An incompatibility between Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT and
Articles 267 and 344 TFEU cannot be considered “manifest” as this term is defined in
Article 46(2) of the VCLT. The CJEU itself in the Achmea judgment framed the
incompatibility between Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT and Articles
267 and 344 TFEU as a mere potential to threaten the full effectiveness of EU law, not
as a blatant violation of EU law (cf. in this sense Exh RL-9, paras 56 and 59).

57

383.

384.

385.

386.

Moreover, the compatibility of intra~EU investment treaties with EU law has been the
subject of considerable debate. The position of the European Commission itself has
evolved: at the initial stages of the European Union’s enlargement in Central and
Eastern Europe, the purported incompatibility between intra-EU arbitration clauses
and EU law was not raised as an issue. Subsequently, the European Commission took
the view that Member States should begin proceedings to terminate intra~-EU BITs
according to their own terms. At that time, the European Commission was careful to
note that these agreements did not terminate or cease to apply automatically. Finally,
the European Commission began arguing that intra~-EU BITs had already ceased to
apply on the ground of being incompatible with EU law. However, this position was
not universally accepted. Before the CJEU rendered the Achmea judgment, Advocate
General Wathelet expressed the opinion that no incompatibility existed between
intra-EU BITs and EU law (Exh RL-29).

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the evolution in the European Commission’s
position and the contrary opinion of Advocate General Wathelet demonstrate that, up
until the Achmea Judgment was issued, the arbitration clauses’ compatibility with EU
law was very much an open, complex, and disputed question on the plane of EU law.
As a consequence, it could not have been “objectively evident to any State conducting
itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and good faith” that the CIEU
would eventually find the existence of such an incompatibility. Therefore, even if
Respondent had invoked Article 46 of the VCLT, which it has not, that provision
would not provide sufficient grounds for the Tribunal to conclude that the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT, or its arbitration clause, is invalid.

In addition, even if the Achmea judgment were considered as a viable ground of
invalidation under Article 46 VCLT, such invalidation must still follow the established
procedures set forth in Articles 65 to 67 of the VCLT. No evidence was submitted to
the Arbitral Tribunal proving that such procedures would have been complied with,
nor did the Parties or the European Commission contend otherwise. According to
Article 64 of the VCLT, the only circumstance in which a treaty may be deemed
automatically terminated is where it is contrary to a norm of jus cogens, which is
clearly not the case here.

(v) The effect of Article 351 TFEU on the validity of Article 10 of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that both Respondent and the EU Commission invoked
Article 351 TFEU to argue that Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is
incompatible with a subsequent treaty, the TFEU. Article 351 provides as follows:

1. The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before
1 January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession,
between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third
countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Treaties.

58

387.

388.

389.

390.

391.

392.

2. To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Treaties, the
Member State or States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate
the incompatibilities established. Member States shall, where necessary, assist
each other to this end and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude.

The first paragraph of Article 351 TFEU confirms that the Czech Republic’s accession
to the EU does not affect its rights and obligations arising out of its agreements with
third States concluded before its accession. The provision is silent about the Czech
Republic’s agreements with EU Member States prior to its accession.

The second paragraph of Article 351 TFEU also only concerns “such agreements”, i.e.
agreements concluded by the Czech Republic with third States before its accession to
the EU.

In any event, Article 351 TFEU does not contain any conflict rules, but simply requires
the Member States to take steps to eliminate any existing incompatibilities between
the Treaties and agreements concluded between Member States and third-States before
the formers’ accession to the EU. Therefore, this provision cannot help Respondent’s
case.

In light of the Arbitral Tribunal’s conclusion that Article 10 of the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT is not precluded by EU law, and the Achmea judgment in particular,
there is no need to verify whether the judgment applies ex tunc, i.e. as of 1 May 2004,
the Czech Republic’s accession to the EU. In any event, this provision does not state
that, in case of incompatibilities, EU law prevails or that the earlier agreement is
invalid. It simply requires that the Member States concerned take steps to eliminate
the incompatibilities. Therefore, Article 351 is not relevant to decide the question
whether Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is precluded by EU law.

(vi) The validity of the arbitration agreement under Article 178(2) of the Swiss PILA

Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal’s conclusions concerning the validity of the arbitration
agreement contained in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT are not put into question
due to the fact that it is seated in Switzerland. Under Article 178(2) of the Swiss PILA
“an arbitration agreement is valid if it conforms either to the law chosen by the parties,
or to the law governing the subject-matter of the dispute, in particular the law
governing the main contract, of it conforms to Swiss law” (Exh RL-34).

Under Article 178(2) of the Swiss PILA, the Germany-Czech Republic BIT and
international law applies to the validity of the arbitration agreement either because the
Parties chose it, Respondent by concluding the BIT and Claimant by accepting the
offer to arbitrate contained in that same BIT; or because these rules constitute the law
governing the subject-matter of the present dispute. As set out in detail above, the
arbitration agreement remains valid in accordance with the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT and international law, which govern the jurisdiction of the present Arbitral
Tribunal.

The issue of the enforcement of the award

Contrary to Respondent’s and the European Commission’s contentions, the Arbitral
Tribunal does not consider that any award it may render would necessarily be
unenforceable. It is true that there exist a limited number of scenarios, under which the
enforcement of the Arbitral Tribunal’s award might be challenging or create further
disputes. However, this does not make the award unenforceable. A truly unenforceable
award can only exist if it is rendered in violation of Article 190 of the PILA governing
the setting aside of awards rendered by arbitral tribunals seated in Switzerland. The
PILA provides no other remedy against such awards.

The only two grounds under which the award rendered by the present Arbitral Tribunal
could be set aside are (i) where it would have wrongly accepted jurisdiction or (ii) its
award would be incompatible with public policy due to its decision that the Achmea
judgment does not preclude Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that its decision is well-founded and not contrary to
Swiss international public policy.

It follows from all the above developed arguments that Article 10 of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT has not been invalidated and contains a standing offer
to arbitrate.

The arbitrability of the dispute

Respondent submits that EU law acts as a mandatory rule of foreign law that renders
this dispute non-arbitrable.

However, Respondent’s position is based on the erroneous interpretation of the Swiss
Federal Tribunal’s case law, in particular the Tensaccai v Freysinnet judgment (Exh
RL-46).

Contrary to Respondent’s position, the Tensaccai v Freysinnet decision concerns the
interpretation of the notion of public policy in accordance with Article 190(2)(e) of the
PILA. For instance, what Respondent calls the “shared-values” test relates exclusively
the notion of public policy and has nothing to do with foreign mandatory laws (Exh
RL-46, para. 2.2.3). The Swiss Federal Tribunal also expressly stated that European
competition law does not belong to the realm of public policy under Article 190(e) of
the PILA (Exh RL-46, paras 3.2 and 4).

The Federal Tribunal only remarked that, once a party invokes a foreign mandatory
law, such as EU competition law, in order to challenge the validity of a contract, the
Arbitral Tribunal cannot deny examining this issue without risking the setting aside of
its award under Article 190(2)(b) of the PILA which sanctions arbitral tribunals that
have wrongly denied jurisdiction (Exh RL-46, para. 3.3). It bears emphasising that
these statements in the Tensaccai v Freysinnet judgment concern the merits of a

60

401.

402.

403.

2.2.3

405.

406.

407.

408.

dispute and not the specifically the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals, i.e. the question of
the validity of the arbitration agreement or arbitrability.

In any event, the Arbitral Tribunal did consider in detail whether EU law could affect
its jurisdiction as argued by Respondent and the European Commission. As explained
above (cf. above paras 367-368), the Achmea judgment does not reach the present
dispute, since the Arbitral Tribunal will not apply EU law to the contentious issues it
has to decide.

Finally, concerning more specifically the issue of arbitrability under Swiss law, Article
177(1) establishes a substantive rule of private international law and considers that
“{alny dispute involving an economic interest maybe the subject-matter of an
arbitration” (Exh RL-34). Arbitrability under Swiss law is thus governed exclusively
by this provision, thereby ruling out limitations of arbitrability based on other laws (cf:
in this sense Exh RL- 35, pp. 21-22). The doctrinal source Respondent relies upon
identifies only one possible bar to arbitrability of foreign law origin, namely public
policy understood within the meaning of Article 190(2)(e) of the PILA (Exh RL-35,
p. 22).

However, based on the definition of public policy in accordance with Article 190(2)(e)
in the Tensaccai v Freysinnet judgment, it is highly doubtful whether the Achmea
decision could ever be considered as forming part of the “essential and broadly
recognized values which, according to the concepts prevailing in Switzerland, would
have to be found in any legal order” (Exh RL- 46, para. 32.).

Consequently, the present dispute can be arbitrated under Article 177(1) of the PILA.

The role of comity

Finally, Respondent invites the Arbitral Tribunal to decline jurisdiction out of comity
for the Achmea judgment rendered by the Grand Chamber of the CJEU.

The Arbitral Tribunal does not deny the existence and the relevance of the principle of
comity in international law. However, Respondent’s position needs to be nuanced as
to the circumstances under which it has been and can be applied in international
(investment) law.

First, it must be emphasised that the principle of comity has no binding force at the
international level and that even domestic judges grant its application rarely and only
in extreme cases (Filippo Fontanelli ‘Comity’ Overview of Topic Westlaw UK (2016),
Exh RL-55, Introduction and paras | and 20).

Second, it is true that comity can be a useful tool of coordination in the application of

international obligations from different regimes in absence of a positive rule of
conflict.

However, comity remains a discretion-driven device, which cannot impose precise
obligations on international courts and tribunals, which can always uphold and
exercise their jurisdiction (Exh RL-55, para. 13). In particular, comity is not a binding
principle of international law (Exh RL-55, para. 20).

If one looks at the rare instances where comity was expressly exercised by
international courts or tribunals, these latter never went as far as to decline their
jurisdiction, but preferred instead to suspend their proceedings or grant comity at the
level of applicable laws or remedies (Exh RL-55, paras 7, 8 and 18-19). In order words,
the Arbitral Tribunal is not aware of any other (investment arbitral) tribunal or
international court having declined to exercise jurisdiction over a dispute due to
considerations of comity when its jurisdiction was otherwise established.

It is true that the International Court of Justice (hereinafter “ICJ”) considered in the
Cameroon v United Kingdom case that, “even if the Court, when seised, finds that it
has jurisdiction, the Court is not compelled in every case to exercise that jurisdiction”
(Exh RL-65, p. 29). Nonetheless, the ICJ made this statement obiter dictum. In
addition, the ICJ when making this statement relied not on the principle of comity as
such, but rather on the concept of administration of justice and the related need to
maintain the ICJ’s judicial character (Exh RL-55, p. 29).

The present Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction stems from the valid arbitration agreement
that was concluded between the Parties and by which they entrusted the resolution of
their dispute to the present Arbitral Tribunal. There exist no other forum that could
adjudicate the Parties’ dispute that arose under the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Therefore, in absence of a specific provision contained in the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT or a binding principle of international law, the present Arbitral Tribunal
must exercise its jurisdiction once it has been established. Its award would otherwise
be sanctioned by the Swiss Federal Tribunal under Article 190(b) of the PILA, which
provides that an award can be set aside if the arbitral tribunal has wrongly denied
jurisdiction (Exh RL-34).

It follows from all the above developed arguments that Article 10 of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT is not precluded by EU law.

Jurisdiction ratione personae

The Parties’ positions

Respondent's position

Respondent considers that Claimant bears the burden of proving that it is a protected
investor, and that it failed to discharge this burden (SoD, paras 223-224). In particular,

62

416.

417.

418.

419.

420.

421.

422.

423.

Respondent argues that once it challenges whether Claimant has a seat in Germany, it
is for Claimant to demonstrate positively that its seat is indeed in Germany (Tr
130:19-25; 131:1-7).

According to Respondent’s position, the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
ratione personae for two independent reasons.

First, Claimant is not protected by the Treaty because it has no seat (Sitz
(German)/sidio (Czech)) in Germany as required by the authentic texts of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT (SoD, para. 225; cf: also Exh RL-6, pp. 2 and 15). The
English translation of these terms in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT is incorrect (Tr
130:2-10).

The term “seat” must be interpreted autonomously under international law unless there
is an express renvoi to domestic law. The Germany-Czech Republic BIT does not
contain such a reference to domestic law in Article 1(3); therefore the term “sear” must
be given an autonomous meaning under international law (SoD, paras 228-230).

When the term “sea?” in interpreted according to Article 31 of the VCLT, it means the
effective place of management and administration of a company’s business operations.
This has been confirmed by international law authorities and several investment
arbitral tribunals (SoD, paras 227 and 231-234).

The little information Claimant has provided about its registered office confirms that
no real business takes place there. The registered office is located in a residential
neighbourhood in Hamburg, at the same address as Claimant’s two limited partners
Messrs Fischer and Meier. The publicly available evidence does not indicate that
Claimant would have undertaken any business activities in Germany. In fact, only
Claimant’s certificate of registration and financial statements until 2016 are accessible,
these being strictly required by German law. Based on its available financial
statements, Claimant does not appear to be a going concern. Consequently, Claimant
does not have its seat in Germany in accordance with Article 1(3) of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT (SoD, paras 236-240).

Second, Claimant does not qualify as a protected investor under the Treaty because it
failed to actively invest in the Czech Republic.

Article 1(3) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT defines “investor” as a body
corporate who is “authorized to make investments”: The ordinary meaning of these
terms indicate that the investor must engage in a certain action, i.e. to invest (SoD,
paras 242-244). Thus, the Treaty only protects investors who actively engage in the
action of making investments (SoD, para. 251).

The active definition of the term “investor” is underscored by the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT’s object and purpose as well as by several of its provisions (SoD, paras
245-252). Other investment tribunals, when faced with similar treaty language, also
required an active investor to establish their jurisdiction (SoD, paras 253-261).

433.

It is for Claimant to prove that it has actively invested in the Czech Republic (SoD,
para. 263). However, Claimant did not behave like an active investor contemplated by
the terms of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Claimant never managed its investment (Article 2(2) of the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT), or purchased and transformed goods, conducted operations, or promoted its
products in the Czech Republic (Article 3(2) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT).
Claimant had no role in deciding to make the investment, funding the investment, or
controlling or managing the investment after it was made (SoD, paras 264-265).

Claimant is nothing more than a business entity, which was created to lease aircraft
and to serve as a corporate vehicle to the exclusive benefit of Fischer Air. Its
relationship to its alleged investment was limited to passively receiving monthly
payments outside the Czech Republic for the lease of the Aircraft (SoD, para. 266).

It was Fischer Air who decided to purchase the Aircraft and controlled and managed
them at all times. It was not Claimant but HSH that financed the purchase of the
Aircraft (Tr 66:1-8).

Accordingly, Claimant does not qualify as an “investor” within the meaning of the
Treaty and the Arbitral Tribunal must decline jurisdiction ratione personae (SoD,
para. 267).

Claimant's position

For Claimant, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae because
Claimant is an investor protected by the Treaty (SoC, para. 90).

Article 1(3) of the Treaty refers to the term “registered office” (SoC, para. 91). Since
Claimant is a German limited partnership and has its registered office in Hamburg,
Germany, it fulfils the Treaty’s definition of “investor” (SoC, para. 92).

A seat in Germany is not required in order to benefit from the protection of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT, but only registered offices (Tr 112:2-10). In any event,
Claimant has its seat in Germany (Tr 21:13-21). If Respondent does not agree, it should
indicate where it considers Claimant has its seat, other than Germany (Tr 112:10-12).

Moreover, Claimant actively invested “in the Czech Republic by placing these two
aircraft at its disposal” (Tr 21:21-23).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Article 1(3) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT in its German and Czech versions
provides as follows:

64

434.

435.

436.

437.

438.

439.

440.

Bezeichnet der Begriff “Investor” eine natiirliche Person mit stdndigem
Wohnsitz oder eine juristische Person mit Sitz im jeweiligen Geltungsbereich
dieses Vertrags, die berechtigt ist, Kapitalanlagen zu tédtigen.

Pojem ,,investor“ znamend fyzické osoby so stdlym bydliskom alebo pravnické
osoby so sidlom v okruhu pésobnosti tejto Dohody, ktoré si oprdvnené konat’
ako investori.

The English translation of the same provision states that:

The term “investor” refers to an individual having a permanent place of
residence in the area covered by this Agreement, or a body corporate having its
registered office therein, authorized to make investments.

According to Article 13 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, only its Czech and
German versions are the authentic. Consequently, these two versions are authoritative,
the English version being a mere translation.

With respect to the requirement for juristic persons to be considered investors, the
authentic versions of the BIT refer to “Sitz” and to “sidlo”. According to the Arbitral
Tribunal’s own reading of the original versions of the BIT, these terms should be
translated as “seat” in English. It appears therefore that the English translation as
“registered office” is erroneous. This has been confirmed by Respondent and not
contested by Claimant (Tr 130:2-3)

Respondent argues that the term “seat” has to be interpreted autonomously under
international law and without reference to any national laws. The Arbitral Tribunal
agrees with this conclusion.

Article 1(3) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT has to be interpreted in accordance
with Article 31 of the VCLT, the first paragraph of which provides as follows:

A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of
its object and purpose.

Article 1(3) does not provide recourse to national law with respect to the definition of
the term “investor”. By contrast, other provisions of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT
do refer to national law, such as Articles 1(1), 2(1) or 7(1). Therefore, when the
Contracting Parties wished their municipal laws to govern a certain issue, they
expressly provided for it in the text of the provision. On the contrary, if they did not
include an express renvoi to municipal law, it is reasonable to conclude that they
intended international law to apply to the interpretation of the term at issue.

Moreover, it is not unusual for contracting States to give a term used in a treaty an
autonomous meaning, which may differ from its significance under national law. On
the one hand, it ensures the uniform application of the treaty. On the other hand, in the

65

441.

442.

443.

444,

445.

446.

448.

449.

context of a bilateral investment treaty, it allows the contracting States to define the
scope of application of the treaty independently of national laws, and extend its
protection to persons and operations in a way that allows them to best achieve the
purpose of the treaty.

Concerning the meaning of the term “seat” under international law, the overwhelming
majority of international law authorities concur that it encompasses the effective place
of management and central administration of a company’s business activities (Exh
RL-72 and RL-74 to RL-83).

Consequently, in order to establish its jurisdiction over Claimant, the Arbitral Tribunal
will verify whether Claimant has its seat, i.e. its effective place of management and
central administration, in Germany in light of the evidence provided by the Parties.

Claimant is a German limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with registered
offices in Hamburg, Germany. Claimant figures in the Companies Register in
Hamburg, Germany (Exh C-3). All Claimant’s financial statements available on record
were deposited in Germany (Exh R-46 to R-54).

Respondent does not argue that Claimant would have its seat elsewhere, but seems to
suggest that these elements are not sufficient to conclude that Claimant has its seat in
Germany.

However, there exists no established and exhaustive list of the elements indicating a
company’s effective place of management and central administration. A company
must have its seat somewhere, and it is the Arbitral Tribunal’s task to identify where
it is located based on the specific facts of the case.

Claimant is a legitimate company with its registered office and all of its, admittedly
limited, activities in Germany. Respondent offered no evidence that Claimant might
be managed and administered from another place. The fact that according to
Respondent Claimant does not appear to be a going concern does not change this
analysis. The definition of seat does not equate to ongoing business.

Therefore, to the extent that Claimant, like every company in existence, must have a
seat somewhere, its seat is in Germany in accordance with Article 1(3) of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Respondent also argues that the Germany-Czech Republic BIT requires protected
investors to engage in the act of investing, i.e. to actively invest.

It is important to clarify what is meant by the terms “engage in the act of investing” or
“actively invest’. The provisions of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT and the
authorities Respondent invokes in order to sustain its argument support a different, less
far-reaching conclusion with regard to the role of the investor required under the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

66

450.

451.

452.

453.

454.

455.

456.

Article 1(3) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT provides that investors must be
authorized to “make an investment’. The ordinary meaning of these terms indeed
indicates that the investor has to act and effectively engage in the action of making the
investment. It is equally possible to draw the same conclusion based on other
provisions of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, such as Articles 2(1), 2(2), 4(1) and
8, referring to “investments by investors” or “investments made by investors”.

Article 3(2) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT refers to investors’ “activities in
connection with such investments” to which a certain treatment must be accorded.
Protocol 3(a) of the BIT provides examples, in the form of a non-exhaustive list, of
what constitutes “activities” under Article 3(2), which shall enjoy a certain treatment.
However, this provision concerns not the making of, but the life of an investment.
Therefore, it does not support Respondent’s position concerning the requirement of an
active role for the investors in the making of the investment.

Moreover, Protocol 3(c), which promises sympathetic consideration to applications by
individuals from the other Contracting Party for entry, residence and work permit in
connection with an investment, is not relevant to the issue whether an active role is
required from investors under the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Concerning the authorities Respondent invokes, as Respondent itself points out, they
interpret similar or identical treaty language to what the Germany-Czech Republic BIT
contains (SoD, para. 261). However, the arbitral tribunals and the judge rendering
these decisions were faced with a different question, namely, whether “passive
ownership of shares in a company not controlled by the claimant where that company
in turn owns the investment” (Standard Chartered Bank v Tanzania, Exh RL-84,
para. 230), or where a company did not make any payment or transfer anything of
value in return for becoming the indirect owner or controller of the shares in the
company that owns the investment (Gold Reserve v Venezuela, High Court of Justice,
Exh RL-85, paras 37 and 42-43; Alapli v Turkey, Exh R-86, paras 337-360), can be
considered as an investor under the relevant bilateral investment treaties.

The findings of these tribunals and the English High Court judge must be interpreted
in light of the specific facts and legal issue they faced, and should not be automatically
transposed to the present case. In particular, since the factual matrix in the present case,
where Claimant directly made and owns the investment, is very far from the ownership
structures in the above-mentioned cases.

Nevertheless, even if one applies the tests established by the Standard Chartered Bank
v Tanzania and the Alapli v Turkey tribunals, the conclusion that Claimant actively
invested in the Czech Republic is inescapable.

According to the arbitral tribunal in the Standard Chartered Bank case, the investor
should have a role in “deciding to make the investment, funding the investment, or
controlling or managing the investment after it was made” (Exh RL-84, para. 228).
The arbitral tribunal in the Alapli v Turkey case concluded that in order to establish the

67

457.

458.

4.1

4.11

459.

460.

461.

462.

activity of investing, it “must find an action transferring something of value (money,
know-how, contacts, or expertise) from one treaty-country to another” (Exh RL-86,
para. 360).

Claimant, a German company, itself purchased the Aircraft from Fischer Air by
transferring the purchase price to the Czech company’s account (cf. paras 10, 13 and
19 above). The fact that Claimant obtained the necessary funds for these transactions
via a bank loan is entirely irrelevant (cf. SoD, para. 265). In addition, there is no
evidence on record suggesting that the decision to buy the Aircraft and to lease them
to Fischer Air was made by someone else than Claimant.

Consequently, Claimant must be considered an investor under Article 1(3) of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT, as it has its seat in Germany and has actively engaged
in the act of investing in the Czech Republic.

Jurisdiction ratione materiae

The Parties’ positions

Respondent's position

For Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione materiae
because Claimant’s alleged investments are not protected by the Treaty.

Article 1(1) of the Germany- Czech Republic BIT defines “investments” as “all kinds
of assets that are invested in accordance with domestic legislation”, followed by a
non-exhaustive list of examples. However, not all assets falling within the list of
Article 1(1) can be considered investments under the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.
The term “investments” also has an inherent meaning. This inherent meaning consists
of three unanimously accepted criteria: (i) contribution; (ii) duration; and (iii) risk. It
follows that the protection of the BIT cannot be accorded to purely commercial
transactions not satisfying these criteria (SoD, paras 269-276).

Respondent qualifies the purchase and the lease of the Aircraft as pure commercial
transactions that cannot benefit from the protection of the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT (SoD, para. 277). No money or other resources flowed to the Czech Republic, and
all payments with regards to the Aircraft were made to accounts outside the Czech
Republic (SoD, paras 278-280).

Moreover, Fischer Air bore all risks and costs associated with the ownership, operation
and maintenance of the Aircraft (SoD, para. 283). Claimant undertook only a general
tisk of doing business, if any, and no investment risk (SoD, paras 284-287). In other
words, Claimant was never “in a situation where ... it could not be sure of a return of
[its] investment and may not know the amount [it] will end up spending (Tr 61:4-7). It

68

4.1.2

463.

464.

465.

466.

4.2

467.

follows that Claimant engaged in a purely commercial transaction that does not satisfy
the inherent meaning of the term “investment” in Article 1(1) of the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT (SoD, para. 288).

Claimant's position

Claimant submits that the definition of investment in the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT is an asset-based and wide one, with a non-exhaustive list of what shall be
considered an investment. The aim of the provision is to provide a far-reaching
protection (SoC, para. 95).

The Aircraft, as movable assets, fall under Article 1(1)(a) of the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT (SoC, para. 97).

The revenues from the Lease Agreements are intrinsically linked to the Aircraft, thus
falling within the scope of Article 1(1) (SoC, para. 99). Moreover, the future lease
payments can be considered as “amount yielded by an investment’, thereby also falling
under Article 1 (2) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT (SoC, para. 101).

Finally, Claimant notes that its investment meets even the Salini criteria, which were
elaborated for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and are thus not directly
applicable in the present case (SoC, para. 100).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Article 1(1) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT provides as follows:

The term “investments” comprises all kinds of assets that are invested in
accordance with domestic legislation, particularly:

(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem such as
mortgages and liens;

(b) Shares and other kinds of participation in companies;

(c) Claims to money that has been used to create economic value or claims to
services that have economic value and are related to an investment;

(d) Intellectual property rights, including, in particular, copyright, patents,
registered designs, industrial designs and models, trademarks, trade names,
technical processes, know-how and goodwill;

(e) Concessions under public law, including concessions for prospecting and
exploitation.

471.

473.

474.

475.

The Arbitral Tribunal will interpret the term “investment” in accordance with the
relevant provision of the VCLT.

As noted previously, Article 31(1) of the VCLT sets out that international treaties
should be interpreted (i) in good faith, (ii) in accordance with the ordinary meaning of
the terms, (iii) in their context and (iv) in the light of their object and purpose.

Article 1(1) refers to “all kinds of asset” when defining the term “investments”. It is
also clear from the term “particularly” that the list it contains is non-exhaustive. These
two elements of the definition of investment together indicate a broad scope of assets
and operations that can be protected under the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

However, these elements also mean that other categories of assets than those listed in
Article 1(2) could be considered as investments under the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT. Therefore, the term “investments” must have an inherent ordinary meaning,
which encompasses the operations listed in Article 1(a) of the Germany-Czech
Republic BIT, but also other operations; and which acts as a benchmark against which
non-listed categories of assets must be assessed. Considering otherwise would go
against the clearly expressed will of the Contracting Parties (cf also in this sense
Romak v Uzbekistan, Exh RL-14, para. 180).

The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the position of a long line of investment awards,
aptly formulated in the Romak v Uzbekistan award, that the ordinary meaning of the
term “investment” entails a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and
involves some risk, which is more than a simple commercial risk (Exh RL-14, paras
207 and 230).

Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the definition of investment proposed
by Respondent and not specifically contested by Claimant. However, contrary to
Respondent’s position, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimant’s assets fulfil the
relevant criteria and thus qualify as investments under the Germany-Czech Republic
BIT.

The Lease Agreements are long-term contracts, concluded for a term of 30 years. They
generated income as a result of the Aircraft being used in the Czech Republic, where
they were also registered. In other words, Claimant bought and employed an asset in
the Czech Republic for the purpose of generating a long-term cash flow.

Moreover, Claimant undertook an investment risk that went beyond mere commercial
risk. The investment risk consisted of placing an income-generating asset in the
territory of another State for a substantial amount of time. The long duration of the
operation meant that a great number of events and contingencies could have happened
to the asset while being utilised in another country, including governmental actions.
Due to the location of the asset and the duration of the operation, Claimant’s risk was
not limited to non-payment or similar general business risk.

Therefore, Claimant has made an investment in the Czech Republic in accordance with
Article 1(1) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Abuse of right

The Parties’ positions
Respondent's position

For Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction because Claimant
abused its rights when initiating the present arbitral proceedings.

In international investment law, bringing multiple proceedings in multiple fora to
recover the same economic harm amounts to an abuse of right and a violation of the
principle of good faith (SoD, paras 290-294). Such violation is based on a principle of
international law, the principle of good faith, and is thus independent of any language
in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT or of the existence of a “fork in the road”
provision (Tr 135:11-15 and 24-25, 136:1-2). In this respect, Respondent expressly
refrained from making arguments based on a possible waiver of the arbitration
agreement contained in Article 10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT by the
initiation of national court proceedings or on the principle of res judicata (Tr 136:
3-11).

Respondent considers, based on the findings of the Orascom v Algeria tribunal, that
an abuse is also committed if the multiple proceedings are initiated by the same entity
before an arbitral tribunal and several national courts instead of different arbitral
tribunals (SoD, para. 295).

Claimant has sought to recover damages for the same loss in multiple proceedings
against Respondent, namely in two proceedings before the Czech courts and in one
proceeding before the present Arbitral Tribunal (SoD, paras 297 and 303).

Claimant admitted that the court proceedings involved the same parties and the same
facts as the present arbitral proceedings (SoD, para. 304). The fact that, compared to
the proceedings before the Czech courts, Claimant increased its damage claims in the
present arbitration, does not change anything with regards to its abusive behaviour
(SoD, para. 304). Claimant itself stated that the reason why it turned to arbitration was
that the proceedings before the Czech courts were likely to last a couple of years and
that it did not consider litigation as an effective protection of its rights (SoD,
para. 304). However, initiating three proceedings in order to increase one’s chances of
success amounts to an abuse of right (SoD, para. 304).

It follows that Claimant has violated its duty of good faith and that because of this
abuse of right, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot hear Claimant’s claims (SoD, para. 305).

Claimant's position

Claimant first argues that the Germany-Czech Republic BIT does not require the
exhaustion of local remedies. Claimant chose to turn to the present Arbitral Tribunal
for international law protection, because after years of proceedings before the Czech
courts it does not consider litigation in the Czech Republic an effective way to enforce
its rights (SoC, para. 109).

The proceedings before the Czech courts do not prevent this Arbitral Tribunal from
hearing the dispute (SoC, para. 110). The arbitral proceedings would be prevented only
if four cumulative conditions of litispendence were fulfilled: (i) the same parties; (ii)
the same facts; (iii) the same cause of action; and (iv) the same legal order and
courts/tribunals within that legal order (SoC, para. 112). Since the last two conditions
are not met, Claimant deems its claims to be admissible (SoC, para. 113).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Respondent’s interpretation of the principle of good faith with respect to multiple
proceedings brought in multiple fora for the same economic harm is exclusively based
on the findings of the Orascom v Algeria tribunal. It is on this basis that Respondent
concludes that Claimant violated the principle of good faith and abused its rights when
it brought proceedings before national courts and the present Arbitral Tribunal with
respect to the same economic harm. However, the Orascom v Algeria tribunal never
went this far in its conclusions.

In the Orascom v Algeria case, the arbitral tribunal dealt with a very different scenario
from the one at issue in the present case, namely investment claims brought by
different entities in a vertical chain of companies under different investment treaties.

It is strictly in this context that the tribunal stated the following:

where multiple treaties offer entities in a vertical chain similar procedural rights
of access to an arbitral forum and comparable substantive guarantees, the
initiation of multiple proceedings to recover for essentially the same economic
harm would entail the exercise of rights for purposes that are alien to those for
which these rights were established’ (Orascom v Algeria, Exh RL-26,
para. 543).

It is worth noting that the tribunal’s finding of abuse of process is conditioned on the
similar features of the different investment treaties under which the claims were
brought, in particular on the similar procedural right of access to an arbitral forum and
comparable substantive guarantees. There exist no such similarities between
proceedings brought under municipal law before national courts and an arbitration
initiated under a bilateral investment treaty providing specific international law

72

491.

492.

493.

494.

495.

protection to foreign investment, including the investor’s right to bring its claim before
an international arbitral tribunal.

Moreover, there are no provisions in the Germany-Czech Republic BIT that would
prohibit engaging in litigation before national courts at the same time or before
initiating arbitration under its Article 10. Similarly, the principle of good faith in
international law cannot be and has never been interpreted to exclude seeking remedies
in parallel or subsequently before national courts and international tribunals for the
same economic harm, given the different nature of the two legal systems, in particular
the dispute resolution mechanisms and remedies they offer.

Consequently, Claimant has not abused its rights and did not act in violation of the
principle of good faith when it initiated the present arbitral proceedings under Article
10 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, notwithstanding any ongoing litigation in the
Czech courts.

Jurisdiction ratione voluntatis

The Parties do not contest that the present arbitration was initiated in accordance with
the Parties’ will and based on a valid arbitration agreement.

The Germany-Czech Republic BIT, including its Article 10 containing the offer to
arbitrate, entered into force on 2 August 1992. On | February 2016, Claimant delivered
its Notice on the Existence of the Dispute into the hands of the then Minister for
Finance (SoC, para. 107), and submitted its Request for Arbitration on
30 November 2016.

There existed a valid offer to arbitrate when Claimant submitted its Notice of Dispute
in February 2016. Claimant complied with the six-month period between the Notice
of Dispute and its Request for Arbitration required by Article 10(2) of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Therefore, there can be no doubt that the Parties validly consented to the present

arbitral proceedings, which were brought in accordance with Article 10 of the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT.

Conclusion

It follows from the above that

the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Germany-Czech Republic BIT to
hear Claimant’s claims.

III. Alleged breaches of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT

The issues

Claimant alleges the following breaches of the Treaty by Claimant:

— Unlawful expropriation;

— Full protection and full security standard;
— Just and equitable treatment;

— Arbitrary and discriminatory measures;
— National treatment (SoC para. 239).

Respondent denies any wrongdoing on its part and requests that the Arbitral Tribunal
dismiss Claimant’s allegations.

The Arbitral Tribunal will first determine the law applicable to the merits of the case.
The next step of the analysis will be to ascertain whether any of the challenged acts is
attributable to Respondent. And finally, the Arbitral Tribunal will analyse the
allegations of a Treaty breach.

Applicable law

The Parties’ position
Claimant's position

Claimant argues that the general principle of iura novit curia is applicable to the
present dispute through Article 38(1)(c) ICJ Statute (SoC, para. 114). Additionally, the
following sources of law are applicable in this case:

(i) The Treaty is the primary source of law applicable to the dispute (SoC,
para. 115).

(ii) If the Treaty is silent on an issue, the Arbitral Tribunal should apply international
customary rules, especially on responsibility of states as contained in the
ARSIWA and on treaty interpretation as reflected in the VCLT (SoC, para. 115).

(iii) If the case cannot be resolved by the Treaty or by international customary law,
the Arbitral Tribunal should apply general principles of law (SoC, para. 116).

For Claimant, “[d]omestic law should be treated as a mere fact”, which means that (i)
iura novit curia principle does not apply to domestic law, and (ii) Respondent cannot
invoke its domestic law to justify breach of international obligations.

Claimant also states that EU law is a part of Respondent’s domestic law and, pursuant
to Article 1(2) of the Czech Republic’s Constitution, national law should be
interpreted in a manner consistent with international law (SoC, paras 117 and 119).

Respondent's position

Respondent argues that the law applicable to the present dispute is the Treaty,
supplemented by international law, including EU law (SoD, para. 186).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis and conclusions

As stated in the POL, there appears to be no contradiction between positions of the
Parties as to the law applicable to this dispute, apart from the application of EU law.

The Arbitral Tribunal has addressed the issue of potential applicability of EU law to
the dispute under the Treaty in paras 370-375 hereof. It came to the conclusion that
when a Treaty is silent on the applicable law, and one of the Contracting States was
not even a Member State of the EU at the time the Treaty was concluded, the disputes
brought under such Treaty should be decided in accordance with the Treaty provisions
and general principles of international law. EU law can be considered as a matter of
fact.

Attribution

Issues to be considered

Claimant believes that the actions of both the courts and bankruptcy trustees are
attributable to Respondent.

While Respondent appears to not oppose the attribution of the courts’ actions to the
State, it strongly objects to attribution of the acts of the bankruptcy trustees due to their
special status under the Czech law.

The Arbitral Tribunal will summarise the positions of the Parties on attribution,
determine the applicable law and will analyse the arguments presented by both Parties.

It should be noted that the issue of attribution becomes relevant only if the Arbitral
Tribunal finds that any or all of the allegedly attributable acts were in violation of
Respondent’s obligations under the Treaty.

The Parties’ position
Claimant’s position

Claimant argues that since the Treaty remains silent on the issue of attribution,
Articles 4, 5 and 8 ARSIWA apply (SoC, paras 126-127).

First, acts and omissions of courts are attributable to Respondent because they are state
organs de jure (SoC, para. 128); therefore, in accordance with Article 4 (1) ARSIWA,
the courts’ failure to prevent the sale of the Aircraft is attributable to Respondent (SoC,
paras 130-132).

Second, Claimant argues that the acts of bankruptcy trustees are attributable to the
States on the following grounds:

Pursuant to Article 4 (1) ARSIWA, as bankruptcy trustees are the organs of the state
de jure

Claimant states that although bankruptcy trustees are individuals, they are organs of
the state de jure under Czech law because (i) they are appointed by the court, (ii) they
must be impartial and independent, and (iii) they fulfil a role that is usually reserved
to executive or judicial organs of the state (SoC, paras 136-137).

Furthermore, the Constitutional Court has considered bankruptcy trustees as public
organs (SoC, paras 146-147).

Pursuant to Article 5 ARSIWA, as bankruptcy trustees exercise elements of
governmental powers

Claimant points out that the legal status as well as rights of the bankruptcy trustees
arise from the law (SoC, para. 161) and are therefore delegated by the state (SoC,
para. 163). The fact that states delegate such powers to non-state entities does not
prevent the states from being held responsible internationally (SoC, para. 163).

The Bankruptcy and Composition Act, notably Sections 14, 19 and 27, delegate to
bankruptcy trustees certain powers otherwise reserved to the state (SoC, paras
171-178). Czech legal scholars unanimously consider bankruptcy trustees to be organs
of the state by function and to be invested with elements of governmental powers (SoC,
para. 141).

Moreover, the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court recognised that bankruptcy
trustees may commit a crime that can only be committed by a public official (SoC,
para. 180).

The forced sale of the Aircraft by We | qualifies as the exercise of governmental
powers which should be attributed to Respondent (SoC, paras 164-168)

521.

3.2.2

522.

(a)

523.

Claimant further argues that the Vécklinghaus decision is erroneous with regards to
the attribution of bankruptcy trustees’ actions to the state for the following reasons:

— As pursuant to Article 3 ARSIWA, international responsibility is independent
from liability under national laws (SoC, para. 191), the issue of attribution must
be resolved based on Article 4, 5 or 8 ARSIWA (SoC, para. 192) and not in
accordance with the national law.

— The Tribunal in Vécklinghaus failed to rely on recognised scholars who all
consider bankruptcy trustees to be organs of the state in terms of international
law (SoC, para. 195).

— The fact that a bankruptcy trustee is personally liable for damages caused by acts
or omissions does not resolve the question of attribution to the state (SoC,
para. 196).

Claimant relies on Dan Cake v Hungary which established that bankruptcy trustees are
conferred with governmental powers (SoC, paras 206-207). While bankruptcy trustees
may be private persons, it does not mean that they cannot, simultaneously, have the
monopoly for exercise of these governmental powers (SoC, para. 208).

In alternative, pursuant to Article 8 ARSIWA, as bankruptcy trustees are state organs
de facto

Claimant argues that the test of “effective control” is applicable not only to
state-to-state relations (SoC, para. 216). In the present case, both the test of “overall
control” and the test of “effective control” are met (SoC, para. 221).

Although Judge had effective control over the bankruptcy trustees pursuant to
Section 12 of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act, he tolerated their illegal behaviour
and did not use the court’s supervisory power to exclude the Aircraft from the
bankruptcy estates (SoC, paras 218-220). Hence, the conduct of the bankruptcy
trustees must be attributed to Respondent (SoC, para. 221).

Respondent's position

Respondent argues that the acts of the bankruptcy trustees cannot be attributed to
Respondent (SoD, para. 306) for the following reasons.

Bankruptcy trustees are not the organs of the state de jure in the meaning of Article
4(1) ARSIWA

According to Article 4 ARSIWA, the domestic law of the state must be examined in
order to determine whether a person or entity is an organ of the state (SoD, para. 310).
The relevant criteria are whether the person or entity (i) has an “independent juristic

525.

526.

(o)

527.

personality”; (ii) “can be sued in its own name”; and (iii) “exercises operational
autonomy” (SoD, para. 311).

To this effect, Respondents states the following:

— Under Czech Republic, bankruptcy trustees have their own legal personality
which is supported by Vécklinghaus (SoD, para. 313);

— Bankruptcy trustees are not remunerated by the courts or other state organs, but
from the proceeds of the sale of the debtor’s assets (SoD, paras 313-314);

— Bankruptcy trustees do not exercise legislative, executive, judicial or regulatory
duties, since their activities are, at all times, controlled by the creditors’
committee, therefore, Claimant’s comparison of bankruptcy trustees and judicial
bailiffs is erroneous (SoD, para. 316);

— Bankruptcy trustees can only be sued in their own name. According to the
Supreme Court, even if, due to the acts of a bankruptcy trustee, a
“maladministration” in its supervision by the court occurs, the bankruptcy courts
cannot be held liable (SoD, para. 317).

— According to Section 7 of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act, the Czech
Republic is not a party to the bankruptcy proceedings, which means that they are
independent (SoD, para. 319).

— After having rejected Claimant’s arguments of impartiality as irrelevant,
Respondent notes that the fact that bankruptcy trustees are supervised by the
courts does not make them organs of the state (SoD, para. 320).

Bankruptcy trustees do not exercise elements of governmental powers under Article 5
ARSIWA

Since the function of a bankruptcy trustee is confined to managing the debtor’s assets,
bankruptcy trustees do not act on behalf of the Czech Republic or in the general public
interest (SoD, paras 324-326). They do not exercise elements of governmental
authority due to their limited powers (SoD paras 327-328).

Claimant’s criticism of Vécklinghaus is unfounded, as the tribunal qualified
bankruptcy trustees as independent not with regards to the exercise of governmental
authority, but to find that they are not a state organ de jure (SoD, para. 329). Claimant
also failed to provide authorities to support its allegation that having a monopoly is
relevant for the application of Article 5 ARSIWA (SoD, para. 329).

Bankruptcy trustees are not state organs de facto under Article 8 ARSIWA

Respondent argues that bankruptcy trustees do not fall under Article 8 ARSIWA
because they do not act under the direction of the Czech Republic (SoD, para. 330).

3.3

530.

531.

3.3.1

532.

533.

534.

Contrary to Claimant’s argument, Section 12 of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act
does not show that the bankruptcy trustees were acting under the direction, instigation
or control of the state, as is required by Article 8 ARSIWA (SoD, paras 334-335).

Claimant failed to submit any authority to show that investment tribunals apply the
test of “overall control” (SoD, para. 333). No investment tribunal has ever attributed
an act to a state on the grounds that the state had the means to prevent the breach of
obligation (SoD, para. 333). The fact that Claimant criticizes the courts’ lack of use of
their supervisory powers over the bankruptcy trustees further shows that the latter were
not acting under the direction, instigation or control of the Czech courts (SoD,
para. 336).

Finally, even if the actions of the bankruptcy trustees were attributable to Respondent,
the bankruptcy trustees conducted the proceedings with the necessary due diligence,
aiming to preserve the value of the Aircraft (Tr 82:8-9).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Respondent does not contest Claimant’s allegation that the actions of Czech courts, if
found to be wrongful, are attributable to the State. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal will
focus on the Parties’ arguments as to whether the acts of bankruptcy trustees are
attributable to the State.

It appears that the Parties agree that the issue of attribution should be resolved based
on the provisions of the ARSIWA.

Article 4 ARSIWA

Article 4(1) ARSIWA establishes that “[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be
considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises
legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the
organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central
Government or of a territorial unit of the State”.

Under Article 4(2) ARSIWA, “[a]n organ includes any person or entity which has that
status in accordance with the internal law of the State”.

It is clear that, in order to determine whether bankruptcy trustees are considered to be
organs of the Czech Republic, the Tribunal must apply Czech domestic law. Therefore,
in analysing the status of bankruptcy trustees under Czech law, the Arbitral Tribunal
will rely on the decisions of the Constitutional Court.

Decision of the Constitutional Court dated 25 June 2002 (Exh C-238)

The question before the Court was whether the bankruptcy trustee may be denied
payment for her services if the bankruptcy estate contains no assets and no advance
payment has been made to cover the bankruptcy costs.

As the first step of its analysis, the Court found that, according to law and doctrine,
“the bankruptcy trustee is not a party to the bankruptcy proceedings; however, as a
special procedural entity it has a separate position vis-a-vis both the bankrupt, and
the bankruptcy creditors, and cannot be considered as a representative of the
bankruptcy creditors, nor a representative of the bankrupt” (Exh C-238, p. 7 of the
pdf).

The Court indicated that “[t]he doctrine classifies the bankruptcy trustee as a special
public law body, whose task is to ensure the proper conduct of the bankruptcy process”
(Exh C-238, p. 7 of the pdf).

The Court agreed with the doctrinal definition and identified three “aspects defining
the concept of a public law body”, namely, public purpose, method of constitution and
powers (Exh C-238, p. 7 of the pdf). The Court came to the conclusion that bankruptcy
trustees satisfied all three aspects. Therefore, the Court concluded that a bankruptcy
trustee is “a special public law body” and as such must enjoy the “constitutional
safeguards of remuneration and reimbursement of the costs associated with the
performance of public functions” (Exh C-238, p. 10 of the pdf).

Although, as argued by Respondent at the hearing (Tr 145:6-9), this Court decision
was rendered in the context of answering a question relating to the remuneration of the
bankruptcy trustees, this Arbitral Tribunal believes that the Court’s findings on the
public purpose, the method of constitution and the nature of the powers of the
bankruptcy trustee, and ultimately on its nature of a public organ, are of general nature
and cannot be interpreted as applicable only to the question of remuneration.

In light of the above, when read as a stand-alone decision of the Constitutional Court,
the decision dated 25 June 2002, defines bankruptcy trustees as de jure organs of the
State.

However, this definition has been since updated and elaborated upon in further
jurisprudence.

Decision of the Constitutional Court dated 29 October 2019 (Exh R-69)

In Decision dated 29 October 2019, the Constitutional Court had an additional
opportunity to address the “distinctive nature of the position of a bankruptcy trustee”
under Czech law, including its own prior description of a trustee as a “special public
law body”. In this decision, it explained, among other things that, while the trustee is
“in a special position where he has certain powers entrusted to him by the law on the
one hand,” on the other hand he is required by the State to take out liability insurance

80

543.

544.

545.

3.3.2

546.

547.

548.

precisely because he “cannot be considered a ‘regular’ public officer” for whose
actions the State would be liable (Exh R-69, p. 4 of the pdf).

The Constitutional Court also distinguished the trustee from the supervising courts,
which are necessarily State organs and on whom there is no “duty to take out
insurance”. Under Czech law, therefore, “[t]he State is liable exclusively for
maladministration in the discharge of its supervision over the bankruptcy trustee”
(i.e., by the failures of its courts), but is not liable for the malfeasance of the trustee
itself. “The bankruptcy trustee's liability is determined in view of his special position,
where the performance of his activities is associated with a higher share of liability
reflected ... in the duty to take out insurance” (Exh R-69, p. 4 of the pdf).

The Arbitral Tribunal recognizes that this 2019 judgment was made in a case filed by
Claimant itself. However, there is no reason to believe the Czech Constitutional Court
was not analysing independently in this case, nor has Claimant even so alleged. And
in absence of a suspicion that the Constitutional Court was not analysing its own law
in good faith, the Tribunal cannot set aside the Court’s interpretation of its own prior
holding, in order to decide that prior holding means the opposite under Czech law of
what the Constitutional Court is now saying it means.

The Constitutional Court described the trustee as being in a “distinctive” position, or
as an individual with a “special position” of a “distinctive nature.” Deciding whether
the trustee is a de jure organ of the State for purposes of the analysis under Article 4
ARSIWA thus involves interpretation of complex matters under Czech law.
Ultimately, however, it is not necessary to resolve that question because, as explained
below, the same difficulty does not arise under Article 5 ARSIWA.

Article 5 ARSIWA

Pursuant to Article 5 ARSIWA “[t]he conduct of a person or entity which is not an
organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to
exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State
under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the
particular instance”.

In light of the analysis of the two decisions of the Constitutional Court herein above,
it is abundantly clear that bankruptcy trustees have “certain powers entrusted to [them]
by the law” (Exh R-69, p. 4).

It follows that, regardless of whether a bankruptcy trustee is defined as a private citizen
or a special public law body, so long as he/she is being delegated public duties,
essentially to act as an agent of the State within a limited remit, Article 5 ARSIWA
requires attribution of acts taken within the scope of the delegation/agency.

Article 8 ARSIWA

Article 8 ARSIWA stipulates that “[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall
be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of
persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of,
that State in carrying out the conduct”.

The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Article 8 ARSIWA is not applicable
in the situation at hand, where bankruptcy trustees acted within the framework of their
statutory duties and without specific directions, instructions or control from the State.

Equally, Claimant’s argument that the failure by the courts to prevent the alleged
wrongful acts by bankruptcy trustees makes those acts attributable to the State by
application of the “overall control” test is unfounded.

Conclusion

It follows from the above

that acts and omissions of the bankruptcy trustees, if found to be wrongful, are
attributable to Respondent in accordance with Article 5 ARSIWA, whether or not
they might independently be attributable to the Respondent in accordance with
Article 4 ARSIWA.

Legality of acts and omissions by the bankruptcy trustees and the courts

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that Claimant relies on the same set of acts and omissions
by the bankruptcy trustees and the courts when it alleges various breaches of the Treaty
by Respondent. Therefore, the Tribunal will first analyse each of the acts and
omissions about which Claimant complains and determine whether those acts and
omissions were unlawful under Czech law.

Seizure of the Aircraft and their inclusion into Mr Fischer’s estate by Mr |

Claimant dates the beginning of the alleged expropriation and other breaches of its
rights under the Treaty back to the seizure of the Aircraft and inclusion of them into
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate by the bankruptcy trustee Mi on
12 October 2005 (SoC, para. 319).

The Bankruptcy and Composition Act provides the following:

82

556.

558.

562.

(i) “[t]he creditors’ committee is obliged to protect the common interest of the
bankruptcy creditors” (Exh R-24, Section 11(7));

(ii) “[a]n inventory of the estate ... shall be drawn up by the trustee in accordance
with the instructions of the court based on the list submitted by the bankrupt and
with the co-operation of the creditors’ committee’(Exh R-24, Section 18(1)).

As described above, Mi was appointed by the Municipal Court of Prague
first as a preliminary trustee and later as a bankruptcy trustee on 26 April 2005 (Exh
C-5, p. 1).

When Mi included the Aircraft into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate, his
decision was based on the unanimous order by the creditors’ meeting (Exh C-146,
p. 1). Following the objections by Claimant and, in particular, the submission of
Prof Hirte’s legal opinion on German law, Mi excluded the Aircraft from the
estate (Exh C-9, C-43).

Therefore, the bankruptcy trustee followed the procedures established by Czech law
when he complied with the decision of the creditors and included the assets claimed
by the creditors. Once this decision was contested, he evaluated the arguments and
came to the conclusion that the assets did not belong to the estate (Exh C-9, C-43).
This conclusion was ultimately confirmed by the courts (Exh R-28).

Claimant failed to prove that Mra was acting in bad faith and/or in breach of
his duties as a bankruptcy trustee when he took the decision to seize the Aircraft.

Re-inclusion of the Aircraft into Mr Fischer’s estate by Mr

Claimant further argues that the subsequent re-inclusion of the Aircraft into
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate by Mi ensured that Claimant remained deprived
of its property rights (SoC, para. 254).

In accordance with Section 19(1) of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act, “[s]hould
there by doubts as to whether a thing, a right or another property value is part of the
bankrupt’s estate or not, it shall be included in the inventory, with a note stating the
claims asserted by other parties or other grounds which make such inclusion in the
inventory doubtful” (Exh R-24).

In accordance with Section 19(2) of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act “persons
claiming that a particular thing, right or other property value, should not have been
included in the inventory of the bankrupt’s estate” should file “a suit against the estate
within a time-limit determined by the court’, otherwise the asset “shall be deemed to
have been rightfully included in the inventory” (Exh R-24).

83

563.

564.

565.

566.

567.

568.

569.

In the case at hand, Mi was removed from office due to his health issues at
his request and the Municipal Court appointed Mi to substitute him as the
bankruptcy trustee (Exh C-83).

Upon his appointment, Mri took measures to include the Aircraft into the
bankruptcy estate of Mr Fischer (Exh C-55).

In response, Claimant objected to re-inclusion of the Aircraft into the bankruptcy estate
(Exh C-10) and filed an action with the Municipal Court for the exclusion of the
Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (Exh C-118).

Various courts explained that “the bankruptcy administrator had proceeded with due
care and listed the said aircraft in the bankruptcy assets correctly”, given that “the
administrator is obliged [...] to include all items the administrator considers to be
potential parts of the bankruptcy assets”, subject to subsequent review by the courts
in the context of exclusion proceedings (Exh C-95, p. 4). The legal requirement to err
on the side of potential over-inclusion in the event of any doubts was further justified
in this case because otherwise (if the aircraft were found later to properly belong to the
estate) “it would be very difficult for the [bankruptcy trustee] to get the aircraft back,
and the creditors would incur damage because they would not be able to be satisfied
from the sale of the aircraft” (Exh C-61, p.6). The ultimate conclusion about
ownership of contested assets is left to the courts because “the bankruptcy proceedings
are non-contentious proceedings and that disputes arising from them are resolved
outside of the bankruptcy” (Exh C-163, p. 4).

It should be noted that although the courts ultimately ruled that the Aircraft were not
the property of Mr Fischer and therefore should be excluded from his estate, they did
not find that the actions of Mri in initially including the aircraft subject to later
court review were incorrect or unlawful (Exh R-28).

Inclusion of the Aircraft into Charter Air’s estate by Mr

Claimant complains that the bankruptcy trustee of Charter Air included the Aircraft
into Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate, despite the fact that they were already included
in Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate. According to Claimant, this inclusion maintained
Claimant’s loss of its property rights after the Aircraft were excluded from
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (SoC, para. 255).

we | explained his decision to include the Aircraft by “the failure to fulfil the
formal requirements for transfer of the aircraft from the proprietorship of Charter Air
s.r.o. in 1997 to the assets of the current owner pursuant to Section 196a, Commercial
Code, given that consent to such transfer was not granted in particular by the general
meeting of the seller’s company” (Exh C-151, p. 2). This decision was based on the
legal opinion of Prof Dedic (Exh C-112).

Claimant objected to the inclusion of the Aircraft in court proceedings (Exh C-151,
p. 1)

When assessing the actions of Mr. the District Court of Prague stated that in
order to resolve the issue of contested ownership, it “was necessary to [...] deal with
[German law] and there was a reasonable doubt whether a valid purchase contract
had been made” under that law. It found that the answer to that question was not
obvious at the outset, and further stated as follows:

It is necessary to take into account the duty of the receiver to include in the
bankrupt’s estate all things which belong in it and even those with which it is not
clearly obvious whether they belong in the bankrupt’s estate or not. The receiver
is to a great extent bound by the decisions of the creditors’ committee as to what
things are to be included in the bankrupt’s estate. In this respect the court
believes that the receiver did not err by including the things in the bankrupt’s
estate (Exh C-137, p. 19).

In light of the above, it is clear that Mr mm decision to include the Aircraft into the
bankruptcy estate of Charter Air was in compliance with Czech law.

Courts’ failure to intervene in the actions of bankruptcy trustees

Claimant argues that the Czech courts’ non-intervention in the bankruptcy trustees’
actions constituted expropriation by omission (SoC, para. 278) and breach of FET and
FPS standards (SoC, paras 407-409, 503).

The Bankruptcy and Composition Act contains the following provisions regarding
court supervision:

(i) The court is entitled to request reports and explanations from the bankruptcy
trustee, to inspect the accounts and to conduct enquiries as necessary. The court
may require the trustee to seek the opinion of the creditors’ committee on certain
issues, or it may contact the committee directly (Exh R-24, Section 12(1));

(ii) When performing supervisory activity, the court decides on matters concerning
the course of the bankruptcy proceedings and takes the necessary steps to ensure
the purpose of such proceedings (Exh R-24, Section 12(2)).

(iii) Claims for the exclusion of things from the bankrupt’s estate [...] may be
satisfied at any time in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings (Exh R-24,
Section 31(1)).

Claimant and Mr Fischer filed several complaints as to the actions of the bankruptcy
trustees (Exh. C-90, Exh C-118, Exh C-45, Exh C-159, Exh C-166, Exh C-113). Every
claim was considered by the relevant courts and adjudicated in a reasonably timely
fashion in accordance with Czech law.

Claimant did not demonstrate that the courts failed to carry out their supervisory
functions in accordance with the law.

Failure by the bankruptcy trustees and the courts to prevent damage to the Aircraft

Claimant asserts that neither the bankruptcy trustees nor the courts took any measures
to avoid the damage to the Aircraft (SoC, para. 277), in particular, in the following
instances:

@ We did not prevent the deterioration and devaluation of the Aircraft (SoC,
paras 291 - 294).

(ii) we | failed to lease the Aircraft despite the fact that Slovenské aerolinie
a.s. had been willing to enter into a lease agreement (SoC, para. 286).

(iii) The Municipal Court failed to sanction Mri as soon as it found out that the
latter had not been performing his duties with the required diligence (SoC,
para. 290).

Section 8(1) of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act stipulates that “[t]he bankruptcy
trustee is obliged to carry out the duties imposed upon him by the law or by the court
with due diligence (expert care) and is liable for any damage resulting from a breach
of such duties” (Exh R-24).

In relation to Mi alleged failure to lease the Aircraft to Slovenské aerolinie
a.s., the facts are the following:

- In his report dated 23 December 2005, We explained that (i) substantial
funds would be required for maintenance of the aircraft; (ii) such funds were not
available in the bankruptcy estate; (iii) that he “opened intensive negotiations on
potential lease of the aircraft”; (iv) that there were “only two companies in the
Czech Republic that are able to operate the aircraft’ - CSA, Travel service, a.s.
and Charter Air, s.r.o.; and (v) that he contacted foreign companies but it was
problematic because Claimant and HSH Nordbank AG threatened to seize the
aircrafts abroad if they are operated (Exh R-27, p. 2).

— On 13 November 2006, Slovenské aerolinie a.s. offered to “provide an initial
investment in order to return the aircraft to a condition fit for operation”,
provided that AMF, HSH and Mri agree to a five-year lease agreement
between AMF, as the lessor, and Slovenské aerolinie, as the lessee (Exh C-57).

— On 23 November 2006, the Municipal Court allowed Mri to conduct the
negotiations and ordered him to obtain written consent from the interested
parties, in particular from Mr. HSH, Mr Fischer, creditors’ representatives
and AMF (Exh C-160)

86

580.

581.

HSH refused to provide the approval, and the deal could not go through (Exh
R-36)

It is clear that Mri followed the instructions from the court and made all the
efforts to negotiate a potential lease, including the leasing agreement with Slovenské
aerolinie a.s. However, the deal was frustrated by HSH’s refusal to approve the lease.

 

In relation to Vi alleged failure to prevent the deterioration of the Aircraft,
the facts are the following:

Claimant expressed its concern to Mri and to the court with regards to the
technical condition of the Aircraft on several occasions (Exh C-44, C-45, C-48,
p. 3 and 4 of the pdf).

The first evaluation of the Aircraft was requested by we | in September
2006 (Exh C-49, p. 1) and in February 2007, the Municipal Court stated that
there was “no risk of immediate destruction or depreciation” (Exh C-159).

In April 2007, in the midst of prolonged negotiations as to the sale of the Aircraft,
We | informed the Municipal Court that mould had been identified in
Aircraft 2 and that there was a risk that the mould would spread to Aircraft 1
(Exh C-152, p. 2). The Municipal Court immediately stated that “any delay in
the sale of the aircraft would increase the risk of damage to the aircraft and
could consequently impede the possibility of selling the aircraft” (Exh C-152,
p. 2).

Claimant strongly opposed the decision stating that “[t]he mould which allegedly
appeared inside the Aircraft surely does not constitute damage that would harm
the Aircraft so intensively as to justify the planned interference in the proprietary
right of AMF, i.e. sale of the Aircraft during the exclusion proceedings” (Exh
C-157, p. 2 of the pdf).

Upon another inspection, Mri informed the court of the discovery of
mould inside the Aircraft (Exh C-53).

Claimant obtained a preliminary injunction ordering we to refrain from
selling the Aircraft without AMF’s consent (Exh C-166), therefore, Mia
had to decline the offer from TNT Airways to purchase the Aircraft for
USD 25,000,000.00 (Exh C-167, p. 4 of the pdf).

In May 2007, upon the assessment by AVITAS, Mi informed the
Municipal Court that the value of the Aircraft went down to USD 10,600,000.00.
(Exh C-167, p. | of the pdf).

On 24 October 2007, the joint inspection found that, due to the long-term parking

on the ground and to extensive mould and rust, the value of Aircraft 2 continued
to decrease (Exh C-154).

87

582.

583.

584.

585.

4.6

586.

587.

In light of the above, it is clear that We | ordered the assessment of the assets and
informed the court and the creditors about the condition of the Aircraft in a timely
manner. It also appears that, in light of lack of funds in the estate for maintenance of
the Aircraft and Claimant’s and HSH’s refusals to lease the aircraft, we
exhausted all the opportunities to minimize the depreciation.

In relation to the alleged failure of the Municipal Court to sanction Mr for not
performing his duties with the required due diligence, in particular, when the court
became aware that the Aircraft was no longer insured, the Arbitral Tribunal notes the
following:

- In March 2006, Claimant informed both We and the Municipal Court that
the Aircraft were no longer insured because Charter Air had stopped paying the
insurance premiums (Exh C-48).

— Claimant also requested the Court to exercise its supervisory powers in order to
remedy the situation (Exh C-48).

—  Euro-Trend s.r.0. expert evaluation of the Aircraft dated 14 September 2006
states that the unpaid quarterly insurance premiums for the Aircraft amounted to
USD 109,216 in total. The expert also explains the following:

The liquidator QM WH vegotiated with Allianz on renewing the
insurance premiums. However, the negotiations were unsuccessfiil,
especially due to high financial demands of the insurance company and a
limited scope of the insurance (e.g. it was not possible to insure the aircraft
against natural disasters) (Exh C-49, p 16).

The facts of the case at hand demonstrate that vin attempted to negotiate the
insurance coverage for the Aircraft. However, in light of the lack of funds in the
bankruptcy estate, it was impossible for the trustee to procure such insurance. Since
Claimant and HSH thwarted the trustee’s attempts to lease the Aircraft and generate
funds for maintenance and insurance, Mri found himself in a deadlock where he
had an obligation to insure the assets but did not have any funds to do it.

In light of the above, Claimant did not provide sufficient proof that Mi acted in
breach of his obligations as bankruptcy trustee, and consequently of the alleged failure
by the courts to exercise due supervision.

Sale of the Aircraft

Claimant asserts that the sale of the Aircraft to a third party made Claimant’s loss of
its property rights permanent (SoC, para. 255).

The Bankruptcy and Composition Act provides for the following rules as to the sale
of the assets included into the bankruptcy estate:

88

588.

589.

590.

591.

- Section 19 (3) states:

Until the lapse of the time-limit for filing [an exclusion] suit and during the
period until the legally final completion of proceedings on the suit, the trustee
may not realize (convert into money) a thing, right or other property value or
even dispose of them otherwise, unless by so doing he averts the threat of damage
to the property which is the subject of the suit.

- Section 27(2) establishes the following:

The sale, other than by auction, shall be effected by the trustee, if this is approved
by the court. In its decision-making, the court shall take particular account of
the opinion of the creditors’ committee and the expected time of realization as
well as of the costs which will be required for the maintenance and
administration of the bankrupt’s estate. In its approval, the court may also
determine the conditions for the sale. A thing sold outside an auction may be
sold below its estimated price (valuation). Disputable and uneasily recoverable
receivables of a bankrupt whose collection (enforcement) would be particularly
difficult can be transferred (disposed of) in a similar manner. No approval by
the court is required for the sale of things which are in danger of immediate
destruction or devaluation. When realizing an estate, the trustee shall proceed
in such a way as to allow a further opportunity for business activity and jobs and
to promote maximum protection of the environment or some other especially
important public interest. The trustee is not bound by the administrator’s
contractual pre-emptive rights (Exh R-24).

In September 2009, the Aircraft remained a part of Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate
with the exclusion proceedings pending before the High Court (Exh C-110).

The expert reports dated 9 and 10 September 2009 assessed the value of Aircraft 1 at
USD 1,049,000.00 (Exh C-175) and the value of Aircraft 2 at USD 1,072,000.00 (Exh
C-176).

The reports also found corrosion and indicated that it would potentially develop into a
“honeycomb corrosion” during the winter and this would “severely damage parts of
the aircraft, engines and electronics and challenge its ability to be put into operation
again” (Exh C-175, p. 19; C-176, p. 13).

On 25 October 2009, Charter Air’s bankruptcy trustee Mri informed the Regional
Court in Prague that (i) HSH had agreed to the sale of the Aircraft (Exh C-174, p.2);
(ii) on the basis of Mi expert opinion the creditors’ committee stated that the
conditions of Section 19(3) of the Bankruptcy and Compensation Act had been met;
and (iii) that “the creditors’ committee decided to sell the aircrafts in an auction” (Exh
C-174, p. 2).

4.7

596.

597.

598.

599.

On 29 October 2009, we | informed Claimant and HSH that HSH failed to
provide its definitive approval and the sale by auction had been frustrated by the
creditors’ committee (Exh C-148, p. 1). Wi | further suggested several potential
ways of dealing with the issue, including an auction, a tender and conservation of the
Aircraft. we | asked Claimant and HSH to respond whether they agreed with the
sale of the Aircraft in a public auction, and asked them to refrain from requesting an
exclusion of the Aircraft from the bankruptcy estate (Exh C-148, p. 2).

On 12 November 2009, an auction decree was signed and the auction took place on
17 December 2009 without bidders (SoC, para. 60; SoD, para. 141). The repeated
auction took place on 28 January 2010 and the Aircraft were sold to AerSale Inc. for
a total price of USD 2,188,750.00 (Exh C-236).

On 23 March 2010, the sale of the Aircraft was registered with the Civil Aviation
Authority and the liens of HSH on the Aircraft ceased to exist through monetisation of
the aircraft in auction (Exh C-142).

It is clear from the facts of the case that the sale of the Aircraft was carried out in
accordance with the rules and regulations established by Czech law. The bankruptcy
trustee acted in accordance with the decisions of the creditors’ committee, regularly
reported to the supervising court and informed Claimant of the potential sale and
requested it to provide its consent.

Failure to provide judicial protection of the owner’s rights

Claimant argues that the state has failed to provide judicial protection of the owner’s
rights and this resulted in expropriation of the assets (SoC, para. 271). In support of its
argument, Claimant quotes from Venable v. United Mexican States, which states the
following:

When it was apparent to bankruptcy court and officials that property in their
custody was rapidly deteriorating through theft, complete inaction on the part
of the court will entrain the responsibility of respondent Government. (Exh
CL-13 as quoted in SoC, para. 274).

In order to rely on the Venable case, Claimant needs to prove that the supervising
Czech courts were aware of the wrongdoings on the part of the bankruptcy trustees
and chose to ignore them or omitted to prevent them.

In the case at hand, the bankruptcy trustees acted in accordance with the Czech law
and adhered to the instructions of the respective creditors’ committees and supervising
courts. From the analysis above, it is clear that the bankruptcy trustees regularly
reported to the courts and Claimant had access to the courts at all time.

There has been no demonstration, that the Czech courts did not follow the principles
of Czech law.

The length of bankruptcy proceedings

Claimant argues that the time frame of five years between the seizure and the sale of
the Aircraft suffices to trigger an expropriation (SoC, paras 327 - 332) because it took
away Claimant’s possibility to administer and deal with his property for a longer
period of time (SoC, para. 316).

It should be noted that the Aircraft were subject to two separate bankruptcy
proceedings, overlapping in time, due to inter alia the structure of Claimant’s business.

In fact, Fischer Air, which originally purchased the aircraft, sold them to Claimant,
which at virtually the same time leased them back to Fischer Air (both companies then
under the common ownership of Mr Fischer). Under these arrangements, Claimant
was set up to be entirely dependent on Fischer Air to make regular lease payments and
also to maintain and service the plane (Exh R-10, C-106). However, Fischer Air
stopped making lease payments to Claimant years before the bankruptcy, and the debts
of both companies and of Mr. Fischer mounted (Exh R-9). Meanwhile, it appears that
the same aircraft also had been pledged as security for multiple HSH loans, including
not just for loans to Claimant to acquire the aircraft from Fischer Air but also for very
large personal loans to Mr. Fischer (SoD, paras 41-44). Mr. Fischer then failed to make
timely payments on those loans (SoD, para. 44; R-9).

Mr. Fischer sold off Fischer Air to Charter Air (Exh R-14). However, Claimant still
remained financially dependent on ongoing lease payments from Charter Air to service
its substantial debt, and Charter Air also acquired the receivables of various banks
against Mr. Fischer personally (Exh R-8, R-14). Ultimately, it led to the start of
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against Mr. Fischer in the Czech Republic (SoD,
Sec 3.1.4). This in turn led Mr. Fischer to file a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding in
Germany, presumably thereby further defaulting on the HSH personal loans which
were secured by liens on the aircraft, on which Mr. Fischer already had defaulted with
respect to prior loan payments (Exh R-21). This was followed by Charter Air’s own
filing for bankruptcy in the Czech Republic, on account of which it lost its license to
operate the Aircraft (so obviously such operations no longer could be the source of any
lease payments to Claimant) (Exh R-22).

There is no claim in this case that the Czech courts proceeded in a way that was unduly
dilatory, arbitrary, abusive or discriminatory. On the issue of dilatoriness, each level
of the courts actually decided the challenge before it reasonably promptly, particularly
given that the issues not only involved competing claims but also competing expert
opinions, some of them on issues of foreign (German) law.

For example, in Mr. Fischer’s bankruptcy proceedings, the Municipal Court decided
Claimant’s exclusion petition (Exh C-118) in roughly 4 months (Exh C-61); the High
Court decided the trustee’s appeal (Exh C-121) in roughly 8 months, resulting in a
remand (Exh C-129); the Municipal Court decided the remanded case in less than 9

91

606.

SLL

608.

609.

months; and the High Court decided the trustee’s appeal (Exh C-132) in 4-1/2 months
(Exh C-127, C-16).

In Charter Air’s bankruptcy proceeding, the Regional Court decided Claimant’s
exclusion proceeding in 4-1/2 months (Exh C-109), and the High Court decided the
eventual appeal about 7-1/2 months after it was filed (Exh C-111; C-115). There is a
longer gap before the Supreme Court weighed in on the High Court decision (Exh
C-110), but it appears that there was collateral court activity in between, so the exact
timing here is unclear, but in any event there has been no suggestion by Claimant that
the Supreme Court was dilatory.

Conclusions

In light of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal came to the following conclusions:

(i) Each individual act of the bankruptcy trustees and the courts were in
compliance with Czech law;

(ii) Claimant failed to provide sufficient proof that the bankruptcy trustees or the
courts acted in bad faith or in breach of their legal obligations.

Expropriation

The Parties’ positions
Claimant’s position

Claimant believes that Respondent’s actions amounted to an expropriation and that
this expropriation is unlawful and in breach of Article 4(2) of the Treaty (SoC, paras
239 and 241).

In the present case, Claimant argues that a combination of different acts and omissions
of the state, be they illegal or not, resulted in a “creeping” or “de facto” expropriation
(SoC, paras 260-261 and 263). In particular, Claimant lists the following acts and
omissions:

(1) From the moment when Mi seized the Aircraft and included them into
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate Claimant gradually lost all its ownership rights
on the Aircraft (SoC, paras 266 and 268).

(2) The subsequent re-inclusion of the Aircraft into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate

by Mi made sure that Claimant remained deprived of its property rights
(SoC, para. 254).

92

we | included the Aircraft into Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate, despite the
fact that he knew or ought to have known that they were already included in
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (SoC, para. 255). This inclusion maintained
Claimant’s loss of its property rights after the Aircraft were excluded from
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (SoC, para. 255).

The time frame of five years between the seizure and the sale of the Aircraft
suffices to trigger an expropriation (SoC, paras 327-332) because it took away
Claimant’s possibility to administer and deal with his property for a longer
period of time (SoC, para. 316).

The Czech courts’ non-intervention in the bankruptcy trustees’ actions
constitutes expropriation by omission (SoC, para. 278).

Neither the bankruptcy trustees nor the courts took any measures to avoid the
damage to the Aircraft (SoC, para. 277), in particular, in the following instances:

(i) We did not prevent the deterioration and devaluation of the Aircraft
(SoC, paras 291-294).

(ii) Mi failed to lease the Aircraft despite the fact that Slovenské
aerolinie a.s. had been willing to enter into a lease agreement (SoC,
para. 286).

(iii) The Municipal Court failed to sanction we as soon as it found out
that the latter had not been performing his duties with the required
diligence (SoC, para. 290).

The sale of the Aircraft to a third party made Claimant’s loss of its property
rights permanent (SoC, para. 255).

The state failed to provide judicial protection of the owner’s rights (SoC,
para. 271).

Claimant further argues that, in order to be legal, an expropriation must occur (i) in the
public interest; (ii) against full compensation without undue delay, including interest;
and (iii) within a properly constituted judicial proceeding (SoC, para. 243). For
Claimant, these conditions were not satisfied.

Claimant alleges that the burden of proof for a lawful expropriation lies with
Respondent (SoC, para. 247). Claimant also contends that only the effect of a measure
is decisive when assessing expropriation, not the intent behind the measure (SoC, paras
251 and 310-311). The reasoning behind the courts’ and the bankruptcy trustees’
actions or omissions is irrelevant (SoC, para. 314) and, therefore, Respondent’s actions
amount to an unlawful expropriation in breach of the Treaty.

616.

Respondent's position

Respondent maintains that it did not breach Article 4(2) of the Treaty (SoD,
para. 349).

For Respondent, carrying out bankruptcy proceedings is an exercise of police powers,
ie. “non-discriminatory regulations adopted by a host State in accordance with due
process” (SoD para. 350). And unless pursued unlawfully or with a purpose of
expropriation, bankruptcy proceedings do not amount to expropriation (SoD, paras
350-351).

When assessing the lawfulness of bankruptcy proceedings, investment tribunals
looked at whether there was no access to the courts; whether the courts rendered an
unfair decision; or whether a state acted with an intent to confiscate the debtor’s assets
(SoD, para. 352). For Respondent, the burden of proof as regards the allegedly
unlawful nature of the bankruptcy proceedings lies with Claimant (SoD, paras
353-354).

 

As to intent Respondent argues the following:

(1) _ the intent behind bankruptcy proceedings is decisive, not the effect (SoD, paras
357-359).

(2) the public interest of bankruptcy proceedings to satisfy creditors in a
non-discriminatory manner outweighs the incidental detriment to the property of
third parties (SoD, para. 360).

(3) without the state’s intent to expropriate, there cannot be expropriation (SoD,
para. 361).

(4) _ in the present case, Claimant does not contest that the bankruptcy proceedings
were conducted without a purpose of expropriation (SoD, para. 357).

Respondent states that the bankruptcy proceedings were carried out lawfully (SoD,
para. 362), in particular:

(1) _ The seizure and inclusion of the Aircraft into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate, as
well as the related court proceedings, were carried out in accordance with the
law and do not amount to expropriation (SoD, para. 364).

(2) When Mri included the Aircraft into Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate, he
acted reasonably and according to his rights and obligations under the
Bankruptcy and Composition Act (SoD, para. 365).

(3) The bankruptcy trustees intended to preserve the value of the assets and thus,
tried to lease and sell the Aircraft. However, every offer they received was

94

617.

5.2.

5.2.1

618.

619.

(4)

(5)

blocked by Claimant or HSH, who ultimately are responsible for the decrease in
the asset’s value (SoD, paras 366-367).

The courts were also in favour of the lease and sale of the Aircraft and
expropriation cannot be done by omission (SoD, para. 288).

The sale of the Aircraft through public auction was not an expropriation (SoD,
para. 369) because

(i) Claimant itself recognised that the sale of the Aircraft was necessary in
order to avoid the further diminution of their value;

(ii) The expert opinion concluded that if the Aircraft were not sold
immediately, no value would be recovered at all; and

(iii) After the auction, we | duly transferred the proceeds from the sale to
HSH (SoD, para. 369).

The lawful exercise of police powers does not oblige a state to compensate an investor
(SoD, paras 350-351). Since the bankruptcy proceedings were carried out lawfully and
in exercise of the Czech Republic’s police powers, the Arbitral Tribunal should find
that there was no expropriation (SoD, paras 371-372). Accordingly, no compensation
is due (SoD, para. 372).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Scope of the standard

Article 4 (2) of the Treaty stipulates the following:

Investments by investors of either Contracting Party may be expropriated,
nationalized or subjected to other measures with effects equivalent to
expropriation or nationalization only in the public interest and against
compensation. Such compensation shall correspond to the value of the
investment expropriated immediately before the date on which the actual or
pending expropriation, nationalization or similar measure was made public.
Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall bear interest at the normal
rate of bank interest; it shall be effectively convertible and freely transferable.
Provision for the determination and payment of such compensation shall be
made in an appropriate manner no later than the date of the expropriation,
nationalization or similar measure. The legality of the expropriation,
nationalization or similar measure and the amount of the compensation may be
subject to review in a properly constituted legal proceeding (Exh CL-5).

The Treaty does not provide for a definition of expropriation, therefore the Arbitral
Tribunal will apply international law, including international investment law, as

95

620.

621.

622.

623.

624.

determined in paras 499-504 above, in order to decide whether the acts and omissions
of Respondent amount to expropriation.

Claimant relies on the case law which provides for a general definition of expropriation
as a partial or complete deprivation of use of the investment (SoC, paras 251-253) to
argue that a number of actions and omissions of the bankruptcy trustees and courts
amount to an unlawful expropriation.

Respondent rightly refers to the decisions of investment tribunals that dealt specifically
with the issue of whether bankruptcy proceedings can amount to expropriation.

The tribunal in the Saluka case stated the following:

In the opinion of the Tribunal, the principle that a State does not commit an
expropriation and is thus not liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien
investor when it adopts general regulations that are “commonly accepted as
within the police power of States” forms part of customary law today (Exh
CL-82, para. 262).

and

The CNB’s decision [to impose forced administration] is, in the opinion of the
Tribunal, a lawful and permissible regulatory action by the Czech Republic
aimed at the general welfare of the State, and does not fall within the ambit of
any of the exceptions to the permissibility of regulatory action which are
recognised by customary international law (Exh CL-82, para. 275).

The tribunal in the Binder case ruled as follows:

[...] bankruptcy is not tantamount to expropriation, and there is no indication
that the bankruptcy in this case was unlawful or irregular or that it pursued an
expropriatory purpose (Exh RL-111, para. 480)

As both the tribunals in Saluka and Binder ruled, bankruptcy proceedings in general
are within the Czech Republic’s lawful regulatory power. It is in the nature of such
proceedings (and as established in Czech law) that they are authorized to temporarily
sequester possible assets of a bankrupt estate to prevent dissipation, while contested
ownership claims are being considered and resolved. The result of such determination
is that either the assets ultimately are excluded from the bankrupt’s estate, or they are
maintained in the estate and are allocated among creditors. In this particular context of
the exercise of a generally recognized police power, the Tribunal considers that more
is needed to demonstrate expropriation than simply that the process of lawful
sequestration and eventual exclusion of a particular asset led to some Jost value
between the dates of those events. Of course, if the assets (or their fair value at the end
of the process) were never returned at all, despite an ultimate finding that they did not
properly belong to the bankrupt estate, the situation could be different. But where some
return of the assets (or their value) took place, the question is whether and in what

96

625.

5.2.2

626.

627.

circumstances either the initial sequestration of the contested assets, or their mere loss
in value between the time of sequestration and the time of return, can amount to
expropriation of the difference.

In this context, the Tribunal considers that some indicia of a wrongfil exercise of what
otherwise would be a valid exercise of these bankruptcy powers must be shown,
consistent with the Sa/uka and Binder tribunal’s focus on unlawfulness, irregularity
and expropriatory purpose. Since Claimant does not argue that Respondent’s actions
had an expropriatory intent, the Arbitral Tribunal will focus on assessing the
lawfulness and good faith of the acts and omissions listed by Claimant.

Application of the standard

As discussed above (cf, above paras 553-607), it is undisputed that basic principles of
Czech bankruptcy law include (i) that the trustee has the /ega/ duty to include any
disputed assets in the estate, in the event of any challenge presented about ownership
(Exh C-137); (ii) that disputing owners then are required to bring legal action against
the estate to exclude the asset (Exh R-24, Sec 19(2)); (iii) that the decision on exclusion
is placed in the hands of the court, not the trustee, whose obligation is to err on the side
of over-inclusion to protect potential creditors (Exh C-61); and (iv) that the Czech legal
system like most is structured with a multi-level system of appeals, allowing all
disputing parties to seek higher recourse before determinations of ownership are
finally resolved. Czech law also (v) forbids the trustee from disposing of contested
assets while these exclusion proceedings are under way, unless there is consent by all
relevant parties or there is a finding of imminent damage to the property (Exh R-24,
Sec 19(3)).

The evidence indicates that all of these requirements of Czech law were duly respected.
In one case, private parties (creditors of Mr. Fischer) claimed that he owned the
Aircraft, and in the other case, private parties (creditors of Charter Air) claimed that it
owned the Aircraft. These claims were not transparently frivolous, given the web of
related party transfers, liens, defaults, and etc., and the trustees thus were required
under the law to include the disputed assets in the estate pro tem, subject to later
exclusion proceedings. The courts considered the competing claims and rendered
certain first instance rulings, which were duly appealed and also decided, consistent
with the requirements of Czech law, and in general without undue delay. The trustee
in the meantime sought in various ways to maintain the assets and prevent undue
deterioration, but these efforts were thwarted by a series of objections by interested
parties, including Claimant itself. Ultimately, with no other solution presenting itself,
the assets were sold and their sale value returned to Claimant. The Tribunal does not
consider this process to have been either an unlawful exercise of Respondent’s
legitimate police powers nor to have been implemented in bad faith.

Conclusions

In light of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal came to the following conclusions:

(i) The temporary sequestration of disputed assets during the course of
bankruptcy proceedings can amount to expropriation only if they were carried
out unlawfully, in bad faith or with an expropriatory purpose, or if upon
determination that the asset does not properly belong in the bankruptcy estate,
the assets (or their fair value at the time of such determination) are nonetheless
not returned to the owner.

(ii) Claimant concedes that after the Czech courts ultimately resolved the
ownership issue in its favour, the sale value of the aircraft was returned to it.

(iii) Claimant does not argue that Respondent’s actions had an expropriatory
intent.

(iv) Upon analysis of the acts and omissions listed by Claimant as constituting
expropriation, the Arbitral Tribunal found that both bankruptcy trustees and
Czech courts acted in accordance with Czech law and therefore lawfully.

(v) Claimant failed to demonstrate that the bankruptcy proceedings were carried
out in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with international law.

(vi) In these circumstances, Claimant has failed to show expropriation either of
the aircraft themselves or of the difference in value between the time of their
lawful sequestration and their lawful sale.

Full Protection and Security

The Parties’ position

Claimant's position

Relying on Siag and Vecchi v Egypt, Claimant argues that whenever there is
expropriation, lawful or not, the duty of full protection and security for investors
(hereinafter “FPS”) is breached if the state does not take measures to return the
investment to the owner (SoC, paras 414-415).

For Claimant FPS is not limited to physical protection and security, but extends to
legal and commercial protection (SoC, para. 394). Therefore, Section 19 (3) of the
Bankruptcy and Composition Act must be interpreted in conformity with international
law (SoC, paras 448-449) to mean that the aim of bankruptcy proceedings is not only
to satisfy the creditors, but also to protect “other interested persons”, including
Claimant (SoC, paras 450-451).

637.

Hence, the bankruptcy trustees in the present case should not only have taken the
necessary measures to physically protect the Aircraft, but should also have provided
the Aircraft with legal and commercial protection, i.e. with insurance and lease
agreements (SoC, para. 395).

Claimant further argues that pursuant to Article 8(2) of the Bankruptcy and
Composition Act, bankruptcy trustees have a duty of due diligence when exercising
their function (SoC, para. 405). The standard for assessing due diligence is that of a
“reasonably well-organised state” (SoC, para. 412).

In the present case, Respondent did not meet the required standard of due diligence
(SoC, paras 412-413). While the bankruptcy trustees displayed a lack of impartiality,
the court (i) failed to appoint competent bankruptcy trustees (SoC, paras 432-433) and
the courts did not intervene to sanction the trustees (SoC, paras 407-409). Therefore,
Respondent failed to adequately supervise the bankruptcy trustees (SoC, para. 447).

None of the bankruptcy trustees acted with the necessary due diligence (SoC,
para. 411). The bankruptcy proceedings conducted by Mr. we and
Mi were ineffective and inefficient (SoC, paras 426-427). Although there is no
express provision in the Czech law that imposes a duty upon bankruptcy trustees to
protect the assets and their value, such a duty may be found when interpreting
Section 8 of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act (SoC, paras 428-429). However,
Mi and Mri failed to protect the Aircraft, especially their value (SoC,
para. 429). Due to the conduct of the bankruptcy trustees, the Czech bankruptcy regime
lost all credibility and trustworthiness (SoC, para. 430).

For Claimant, the Czech legal framework is insufficient and thus breaches the FPS
standard (SoC, para. 417). Apart from a lengthy complaint to the Constitutional Court,
it had no legal means to review or prevent the decision to sell the Aircraft in an auction
(SoC, para. 439).

Claimant compares the Czech legal framework to the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide
on International Insolvency (hereinafter “ULGII”) (SoC, paras 420-421). Contrary to
the ULGII, when a third party disputes an asset involved in bankruptcy proceedings,
the Czech law does not contain a provision which enables an interim protection of the
asset (SoC, para. 422). Accordingly, such measures should be encompassed in the
bankruptcy trustee’s duty of diligence contained in Section 8 of the Bankruptcy and
Composition Act, and in the court’s duty of supervision contained in Section 12 of the
Bankruptcy and Composition Act (SoC, para. 422).

Respondent's position

Respondent argues that the Aircraft were not physically harmed within the meaning of
the Treaty (SoD, para. 444).

99

638.

639.

640.

641.

642.

643.

6.2

644.

645.

Claimant’s authorities all relate to physical destruction of property during “internal
armed conflict, riot and acts of violence” (SoD, para. 446). Respondent recalls that, in
the absence of physical violence, FPS claims have not been admitted by tribunals
(SoD, para. 445). In the present case, the Czech Republic was not in a situation of
public disorder and the Aircraft were physically protected at the Prague Airport (SoD,
para. 446).

Respondent argues that if, as Claimant alleges, FPS extends beyond the physical
protection, the legal protection contained therein is limited (SoD, paras 448-450). FPS
only requires a state to keep its judicial system available and acting in good faith (SoD,
paras 448-450). Claimant has had full access to the Czech courts, which, in the end,
agreed with Claimant (SoD, para. 450). Thus, the Czech legal system provided the
required protection (SoD, para. 450).

Respondent argues that even if the conduct of the bankruptcy trustees was attributable
to the Czech Republic, the latter does not have a strict liability for FPS (SoD,
para. 452). The duty is fulfilled when a state acts with a reasonable due diligence and
it is for Claimant to prove that Respondent breached this duty (SoD, para. 452).

Respondent qualifies Claimant’s allegation of a treaty breach due to an insufficient
legal framework as erroneous (SoD, para. 453). The Czech legal framework for
bankruptcy proceedings does not contain any gaps and only minimally differs from the
non-binding ULGII (SoD, para. 453).

Contrary to Claimant’s allegation, expropriation and FPS are not closely linked, since
they can be found in two different and independent paragraphs of Article 4 of the
Treaty (SoD, para. 456). FPS is also contained in Article 2 (3) of the Treaty (SoD
para. 456). In light of the principle of effet utile, FPS and expropriation are separate
and have a different scope and role (SoD, para. 456).

Finally, due to significant differences between the present case and Siag and Vecchi v
Egypt, Claimant cannot rely on the latter to argue that whenever any form of
expropriation arises, FPS is breached if the state does not return the investment to the
owner (SoD, paras 457-460).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Article 2(3) of the BIT establishes that “[i]nvestments and returns thereon together
with returns on any reinvestment shall enjoy full protection under this Treaty”.

The Arbitral Tribunal will first determine the scope of the FPS obligation established
in international law and analyse whether Respondent has breached its FPS obligation.

Scope of the FPS obligation

Claimant correctly indicates the trend to interpret the “fill protection” obligation as
including not only physical protection (SoC, para. 394). A number of arbitral tribunals
followed Azurix in holding that the full protection and security standard extends
beyond physical protection to include some elements of legal stability and security
(Exh CL-34, paras 320-321; CL-59, para. 326). These interpretations have not been
adopted by all other tribunals, however, with the result that the scope and reach of the
FPS obligation (beyond physical protection) is not yet a matter of broad consensus.

In any event, Azurix involved in particular the issue of a stable (versus changing) legal
and regulatory environment, an issue that is not encompassed by the case at hand,
which does not involve any changes in law or administrative rules.

One particular application of the FPS standard relevant to this case is the host State’s
duty to maintain a functioning judicial system and make it available to foreign
investors seeking redress. For example, the Parkerings tribunal stated:

The Respondent's duty under the Treaty was, first, to keep its judicial system
available for the Claimant to bring its contractual claims and, second, that the
claims would be properly examined in accordance with domestic and
international law by an impartial and fair court (Exh CL-60, para. 360).

The Frontier Petroleum y. Czech Republic tribunal, which reached a similar
conclusion, clarified that legal security includes effective means of redress should an
investment be harmed. It held that it is:

apparent that the duty of protection and security extends to providing a legal
framework that offers legal protection to investors — including both substantive
provisions to protect investments and appropriate procedures that enable
investors to vindicate their rights (Exh CL-64, para. 263).

The Frontier Petroleum tribunal continued as follows:

In this Tribunal’s view, where the acts of the host state’s judiciary are at stake,
“full protection and security” means that the state is under an obligation to make
a functioning system of courts and legal remedies available to the investor (Exh
CL-64, para. 273).

The Frontier Petroleum tribunal qualified that statement by observing that not every
failure to obtain redress is a violation of the principle of full protection and security,
and that a decision that in the eyes of an outside observer, such as an international
tribunal, is “wrong” would not automatically lead to state responsibility (Exh CL-64,
para. 273).

Other tribunals have also confirmed that the FPS standard includes legal security, in
the sense of providing the necessary means for the investor to obtain redress. For

101

653.

6.2.2

655.

658.

example, in A/-Bahloul v. Tajikistan the claimant relied on Article 10(1) of the Energy
Charter Treaty, which provides for “the most constant protection and security”, to
complain about an alleged miscarriage of justice in the courts. The tribunal said:

[...] it is true that, while the concept of protection and security in investment
treaties has developed principally in the context of physical security, some
tribunals have applied it more broadly to encompass legal security as well.
Therefore, it could arguably cover a situation in which there has been a
demonstrated miscarriage of justice (Exh RL-182, para. 246).

Further, in Electrabel v. Hungary, the tribunal found that the obligation under Article
10(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty to provide “the most constant protection and
security” included the duty to put at the disposal of the claimant “the [legal] tools for
obtaining redress” (Exh RL-37, para. 7.146).

As Claimant argues, the FPS standard is indeed one which requires “due diligence” by
authorities, to take reasonable steps to try to protect against foreseeable harm; it is not
a “strict liability’ standard by which the government is rendered responsible for
making the investor whole for all harm the State nonetheless fails to prevent. The “due
diligence” (versus “strict liability”) framing has been adopted by both the ICJ and
numerous tribunals (Exh CL-88, para. 108; RL-139, para. 821; RL-107, para. 430;
RL-161 para. 228).

Application of the FPS standard

The facts of the case demonstrate that there was no impediment to Claimant’s duly
accessing the Czech courts. To the contrary, it availed itself repeatedly of those courts,
and the courts rendered reasonably timely (and indeed favourable) rulings on its
applications.

In this case, as discussed above (cf. above paras 581-582), the trustees did not ignore
the issue of the depreciating asset value. The trustees were alert to the asset
depreciation and tried to forestall it in a variety of ways, but ultimately failed
notwithstanding their efforts.

Finally, Claimant alleges that the Czech legal framework provides insufficient interim
protection of disputed assets, such as might have prevented the depreciation and
ensured that it received the aircraft back at the end of the court proceedings, and this
systemic flaw constitutes a breach of Respondent’s international law obligations.

It should be noted that there has been no attempt by Claimant to show that there is any
other bankruptcy system (much less a consensus of systems) which provides
mechanisms to forestall or remedy the type of harm Claimant suffered (e.g., either
some form of State funding to prevent depreciation of sequestered assets in estates
with no funds, while disputes over ownership are being considered and resolved, or

102

659.

660.

6.3.

661.

7.1

662.

663.

664.

some form of a damages remedy to make up the difference later between the original
value and the depreciated value returned to the proper owner).

As far as the record shows, the Czech bankruptcy system is designed generally in
keeping with international norms, apparently reflected in the UNCITRAL Legislative
Guide on International Insolvency (ULGII) (Exh CL-65).

In the absence of any showing that the Czech system meaningfully departs from
international practice in how it handles this dilemma, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot
denounce the system as falling below established standards.

Conclusions

In light of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following conclusions:

(i) The FPS standard extends beyond physical protection to include (at least) the
provision of legal security, in the sense of a duty of due diligence in
maintaining a functioning judicial system that is available to foreign investors
seeking redress.

(ii) In the case at hand, Claimant had full access to Czech judicial system.

(iii) The bankruptcy trustees and the courts carried out the bankruptcy proceedings
with due diligence.

(iv) The Czech legal system has not been shown to fall below international law
standards in any respect relevant to this case.

(v) Respondent’s actions do not amount to a breach of the FPS standard.

Fair and Equitable Treatment and Arbitrary measures

The Parties’ position
Claimant's position

According to Claimant, the duty of fair and equitable treatment (hereinafter “FET”)
found in Article 2 of the Treaty applies to every situation (SoC, paras 461-462).

In the present case, Respondent breached its FET duty, in particular:
Claimant’s right to a fair trial
The Czech bankruptcy courts infringed Claimant’s right to a fair trial in several

instances:

103

665.

666.

667.

668.

669.

670.

671.

The courts wrongly assumed jurisdiction over Mr Fischer (SoC, para. 473), while FET
implies that jurisdiction should only be exercised on the basis of a firm legal provision
(SoC, para. 470). Also the right to be heard is protected before the opening of
bankruptcy proceedings (SoC, paras 474 and 478).

The Court did not interpret the IR 2000 in good faith and violated Claimant’s right to
a fair trial contained in Article 6 ECHR (SoC, paras 575-576).

The Czech courts should have found out and applied the content of German law to the
questions of ownership of a limited partnership and of the law applicable to the
Purchase Agreements (SoC, paras 503-514). By denying Claimant’s ownership rights
under German law, Respondent breached FET (SoC, paras 553-571).

Hence, the Czech courts’ interference in Claimant’s property, coupled with the
absence of a legal opportunity to prevent the Aircraft from being included into the
bankruptcy estates, violated Claimant’s right to a fair trial (SoC, para. 478).
Consequently, Respondent breached FET (SoC, para. 478).

Denial of justice

The wrongful assumption of jurisdiction over Mr Fischer also constitutes a denial of
justice which breaches FET (SoC, para. 495). If the Czech courts had not opened the
bankruptcy proceedings, the Aircraft would not have been included into Mr Fischer’s
bankruptcy estate (SoC, para. 495). The Czech courts took many years to decide on
the exemption of the Aircraft from Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate (SoC, paras
520-529). These proceedings lasted more than twice as long as the proceedings on the
exclusion of the Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (SoC, paras 534-540).
When the High Court, bound by the judgement of the Supreme Court, eventually sided
with Claimant in 2014, the Aircraft had been sold for four years (SoC, para. 530). This
decision-making qualifies as undue delay, which amounts to a breach of FET (SoC,
para. 529).

Claimant further alleges that the deterioration of the Aircraft can be attributed to the
conduct of Mr and Mri as well as to the undue delay of the Czech courts
(SoC, para. 530). If the courts had decided sooner, the Aircraft would not have
deteriorated to such extent (SoC, para. 531). They would either have been excluded
from the bankruptcy estate or sold for a much higher price (SoC, para. 531-533).

Legitimate expectations

Respondent violated Claimant’s legitimate expectations. When Claimant invested in
the Czech Republic, it could not have known that the latter would eventually become
an EU Member State in 2004, thereby triggering the application of the IR 2000 (SoC,
paras 496-497). Thus, Claimant’s legitimate expectations of a stable business
environment were violated (SoC, paras 498-499).

679.

Standard of consistency

FET implies that states should not treat investors inconsistently (SoC, para. 541). In
the present dispute, the Czech courts did not treat Claimant according to the standard
of consistency because they issued contradictory decisions and behaved inconsistently
(SoC, paras 544-552).

Arbitrary and discriminatory treatment

The conduct of the Czech courts and the bankruptcy trustees qualifies as arbitrary and
discriminatory (SoC, para. 554). In particular, in on the following occasions:

First, the inclusion of the Aircraft by Mi into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate
was arbitrary (SoC, para. 572). Mi did not sufficiently and reasonably
substantiate why he chose a version of German law that allowed him to include the
Aircraft into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (SoC, para. 572). The Municipal Court
also failed to display an adequate reasoning and ignored the existence of the main
insolvency proceedings under Article 3 (1) IR 2000 in Germany (SoC, para. 575).

Second, making a difference between German and Czech limited partnership was
discriminatory (SoC, para. 569).

Third, Mri included the Aircraft into Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate, knowing
that Mia had already included them into Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (SoC,
para. 578). This does not represent good practice (SoC, para. 578).

Fourth, according to the arbitration clauses contained in the Purchase Agreements,
disputes arising out of the Purchase Agreements should have been resolved through
arbitration in Hamburg and under German law (SoC, para. 590). This should have
prevented the Czech courts from assuming jurisdiction (SoC, para. 593). Instead, the
Czech courts did not deny their competence and examined the Purchase Agreements
under Czech law (SoC, para. 593). This violates the principle of party autonomy (SoC,
para. 596). The lack of reasoning behind the Czech courts’ decisions to neglect the
arbitration clauses contained in the Purchase Agreements breaches FET (SoC,
para. 598).

Fifth, the validity of the Purchase Agreements should have been examined under
German law, not Czech law (SoC, para. 601).

Sixth, the Purchase Agreements were valid and should have benefitted from the
principles of legitimate expectations and legal security (SoC, para. 602). When the
validity of a contract is uncertain, the contract is presumed to be valid (SoC, paras
603-604). In the present case, Mi took the opposite approach and, acting in bad
faith, included the Aircraft into Charter Air’s bankruptcy estate (SoC, paras 604-605).
This led to the situation in which Claimant had to request the exclusion of the same
Aircraft in two parallel civil proceedings (SoC, para. 605).

681.

682.

684.

685.

686.

687.

688.

689.

Finally, questioning the validity of the Purchase Agreements after so many years
amounts to a violation of the minimum standard of treatment (SoC, para. 606).

Respondent's position

Respondent argues that it has treated Claimant’s alleged investments in accordance
with FET.

First, there can be no denial of justice without a shocking and fundamentally unfair
wrongdoing (SoD, para. 385). Unless “clear and malicious’, an incorrect application
of the law does not suffice (SoD, para. 385).

In any event, the Czech courts did not act in such a malicious way when applying the
IR 2000 (SoD, para. 386). Moreover, the fact that Claimant had access to the Czech
courts and that, in the end, the latter agreed with Claimant, proves that there was no
denial of justice (SoD, para. 386).

Second, since domestic courts are entitled to make definitive interpretations of
domestic law, this Arbitral Tribunal cannot review the decision of the Czech Courts as
to the application of the IR 2000 (SoD, paras 390-395).

In any event, the doctrine of legitimate expectations only applies to executive and
legislative organs, not to the judicial organs (SoD, paras 375 and 395).

Third, since Claimant is not claiming a denial of justice with regards to undue delay,
Respondent understands Claimant’s position to be that Respondent should be liable
for undue delay because it affected the value of the Aircraft (SoD, para. 398).
However, the low sale price obtained for the sale of the Aircraft at the auction cannot
be attributed to Respondent, but is due to Claimant’s constant opposition to sell the
Aircraft (SoD, paras 399-400). Thus, there was no undue delay that could have
breached the Treaty (SoD, para. 400).

Fourth, contrary to executive organs, judiciary organs are not required to act
consistently (SoD, para. 403). If national courts were obliged to always decide a case
in the same way, every successful appeal would amount in an international wrong
(SoD, para. 403). The decisions from the High Court issued in two different
bankruptcy proceedings were not inconsistent (SoD, para. 404). To the contrary, the
decision rendered in Charter Air’s bankruptcy proceedings took into account the
bankruptcy proceedings of Mr Fischer (SoD, para. 404).

For these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal should dismiss Claimant’s FET claims (SoD,
para. 406).

The Czech Republic’s conduct was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory (SoD,
para. 411).

106

690.

691.

692.

693.

694.

695.

696.

697.

The threshold for arbitrary measures is high (SoD, paras 412-413). Simple
unlawfulness cannot amount to arbitrariness and it is for Claimant to prove that the
bankruptcy proceedings were carried out in “wilful disregard of the law” (SoD, paras
414-416).

First, the High Court’s decision dated 2 February 2007, which annulled the Municipal
Court’s judgement to exclude the Aircraft from Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate, was
well-reasoned and not arbitrary (SoD, para. 420).

Second, the Czech courts acknowledged both Claimant’s procedural capacity and
Claimant’s legal capacity to own property under German law (SoD, paras 422-424).

Third, Mi acted within his rights and obligations under the Bankruptcy and
Composition Act and sufficiently justified the inclusion of the Aircraft into
Mr Fischer’s bankruptcy estate (SoD, paras 425-426). He did not have to further
explain why he chose this version of German law (SoD, para. 426).

Fourth, Claimant failed to explain why the inclusion of the Aircraft into Charter Air’s
bankruptcy estate did not represent good practice (SoD, para. 428). Like Mr i.
Mi justified the inclusion of the Aircraft into the bankruptcy estate, thereby
staying within his rights and obligations under the Bankruptcy and Composition Act
(SoD, para. 428).

Fifth, Claimant’s right to turn to arbitration was not violated. The question of the
validity of the Purchase Agreements was not a contractual dispute, but one that was
connected to the action for exclusion of the Aircraft brought against we | who is
not a party to the contracted arbitration clauses (SoD, para. 430). In any case, instead
of challenging the Czech courts’ jurisdiction to resolve that issue, Claimant took part
in the court proceedings (SoD, para. 430). Therefore, the Czech Republic’s conduct
was not arbitrary.

Discrimination is given when (i) a case similar to Claimant’s case; (ii) is treated
differently by Respondent; (iii) without reasonable justification (SoD, para. 433).
These criteria must be fulfilled cumulatively (SoD, para. 433). Claimant omitted to
refer to this legal standard and, thus, failed to duly substantiate its discrimination claim
(SoD, para. 433). In any event, the Czech courts always recognised Claimant as a legal
subject, capable of owning property under German law (SoD, para. 434). Hence, the
Czech Republic’s conduct was not discriminatory.

Should the Arbitral Tribunal consider that the Czech Republic’s conduct was arbitrary
and discriminatory, Respondent alleges that Article 2 (2) of the Treaty is still not
breached, because Claimant has not established that the Czech Republic’s conduct
“impede[d] the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment” of the Aircraft (SoD,
paras 437-440).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Scope of the FET standard

Article 2(1) of the Treaty stipulates the following:

Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible
investments by investors of the other Contracting Party, permitting such
investments in accordance with its laws. It shall in all Cases afford investments
just and equitable treatment.

It is an established trend in jurisprudence of investment tribunals to include within the
FET standard an element of reasonable compliance with investors’ legitimate
expectations (defined somewhat differently by different tribunals), in addition to a
prohibition on arbitrary, abusive or discriminatory conduct, and also — when the acts
of the judiciary are put at issue — to include within the FET standard an obligation not
to deny justice (Exh CL-64, para. 273; RL-159, para. 314; CL-60, para. 360).
However, although this case certainly involves the actions of the judiciary, it also
involves the actions of the bankruptcy trustees. The Tribunal accepts that the FET
standard before it is therefore not limited to an inquiry about denial of justice.

In principle, the Tribunal accepts that a violation of the BIT could result cumulatively
from the combination of administrative actions and the failure of the judiciary to
correct them, even though none of these actions taken in isolation might be sufficient
on its own to rise to the level of a treaty breach. For example, the tribunal in Ros/nvest
v. Russia observed that it cannot act as a court of appeal of the decisions of Russian
courts and that the standard of finding a denial of justice is high. However, according
to the same tribunal, this did not exclude the possibility that the totality of the measures
taken by the respondent, in their cumulative effect, including but not limited to the
decisions of the courts, could result in a finding of a treaty violation (Exh RL-136,
para. 280).

Application of the FET standard

It should be noted that in this case, Claimant’s claims of various Treaty breaches rely
on the same factual allegations for each claim. When analysing the facts of the case in
the section (cf: above paras 553-607) above, the Arbitral Tribunal found that: (a) the
trustees followed their legal duty under Czech law to err on the side of over-inclusion
of assets to enable the courts to sort out contested ownership claims, (b) the trustees
followed their legal duty under Czech law to try to preserve the value of the
sequestered assets in the meantime, to the extent they could in the unfortunate absence
of funds in the estates and in the face of repeated objections to the various solutions
the trustees suggested; and (c) meanwhile, the various levels of the judicial system
worked the way they were designed, namely to render reasonably timely rulings on all

108

702.

703.

704.

705.

706.

applications, while allowing interested parties the opportunity to present legal
arguments and to appeal rulings with which they did not agree.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that the bankruptcy trustees
and the courts acted in compliance with Czech law, and although individual acts may
not have been perfect, Claimant nonetheless was given full access to the judiciary
which eventually came to conclusions in its favour regarding the disputed ownership
issues. It also should be noted that the Arbitral Tribunal did not find proof that
Claimant and its investment were treated in a discriminatory, arbitrary or abusive
manner.

The Tribunal recognizes that nonetheless, the outcome of events that was objectively
unsatisfactory for Claimant. The Czech courts ultimately concluded that the two
aircraft were not assets of the various bankruptcy estates and thus vindicated
Claimant’s position on ownership, but by the time these rulings had been rendered, the
aircraft already had been sold to forestall further depreciation, with the result that what
ultimately was excluded from the estates was not the aircraft as such, but rather the
proceeds of their sale. Stated otherwise, in the end, Claimant was adjudged to be right
in its claim of ownership, but this vindication came too late for it to regain possession
and control of the aircraft.

In this context, this Tribunal will need to determine whether a cumulative effect of
Respondent’s individually lawful actions were nonetheless unfair to the extent that
holistically they amounted to a breach of FET standard. Such an inquiry requires the
Tribunal to consider whether “fairness” for Claimant under the FET standard consists
not only of fairness in process (in the sense that the trustees and courts at all times
complied with applicable law), but also fairness in effect, in the sense of ensuring at
the end of the legal proceedings, Claimant would be left in no worse position than
before the proceedings started.

In the Tribunal’s view, a finding that the Respondent breached its obligations in the
latter respect would require a conclusion that its legal system should have been
designed to accomplish the opposite result. Presumably, there are at least two notional
mechanisms by which a legal system could do so. One would be through some kind of
State funding mechanism to ensure that even where a bankruptcy estate does not have
liquid assets of its own, bankruptcy trustees have recourse to sufficient funds to
maintain (and not have to sell as depreciating assets) any property that is temporarily
sequestered to prevent dissipation pending resolution of competing claims. The other
would be through some kind of damages mechanism (available against the trustee, the
courts, or the State itself) to make up any loss that a property owner ultimately suffers
from depreciation while the courts are determining ownership, or from a sale in order
to prevent further depreciation.

As for the former, there has been no suggestion that any other recognized bankruptcy

system provides this form of subsidy to a cashless estate, to provide a trustee with
additional resources to main contested assets when the estate itself cannot fund such

109

708.

7.3

709.

efforts and the various disputing stakeholders cannot agree on alternative funding
mechanisms. As for the latter, Czech law has damages mechanisms available for
demonstrated malfeasance by the courts, as discussed inter alia in the recent
Constitutional Court decision, and also has a requirement that the trustee maintain
insurance to be able to cover damages liability for his own actions, but again this
operates in circumstances of a breach of his duties, not as a pool of funds to cover any
and all harm absent malfeasance (Exh R-69). There has been no suggestion that these
limitations on damages recovery resulted from any recent changes in law, as opposed
to long-standing principles of law that were in existence when Claimant invested in
the Czech Republic.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to condemn the Respondent for a breach
of BIT obligations, on account of its not having some additional mechanisms in its
legal system to prevent the type of harm that Claimant ultimately sustained. Such a
finding would amount to a conclusion that legal systems fall below required treaty
standards when cumulatively they fail to provide an “effective remedy” against harms
that befall an investor through the normal operation of State laws, even where the State
action has been found not otherwise wrongfil under international law (i.e., it is in good
faith, not arbitrary or abusive, non-discriminatory, and in compliance with domestic
law.). The Tribunal is unable to extend the FET obligation to this degree.

In declining to do so, the Tribunal finally observes that some treaties contain a separate
standard that arguably might be interpreted as requiring legal systems to provide
“effective remedies.” For example, Article 10(12) ECT provides that “Each
Contracting Party shall ensure that its domestic law provides effective means for the
assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights with respect to investments ....”.
There is no need in this case to interpret the scope of such a standard, for example to
decide whether “effective means for the assertion of claims” equates to a requirement
of “effective remedies,” to forestall or compensate for harm befalling a litigant while
it is pursuing the claims thus asserted. The Tribunal simply notes that the BIT in this
case does not include such a distinct clause, and the Tribunal cannot extend the reach
of the FET (or FPS) obligation to impose the same requirement. That would defeat the
effet utile of including a separate provision to this effect in treaties where States have
done so, since in such treaties there already are separate FPS and FET clauses, and the
“effective means” clause thus would be rendered entirely redundant and superfluous.

Conclusions

In light of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that:

(@) ~~ Claimant has not demonstrated any arbitrary, abusive, or discriminatory
conduct on the part of either the bankruptcy trustees or the Czech courts, nor
that either the trustees or the Czech courts violated its legitimate expectations
regarding the protections afforded by the Czech legal system.

(ii)

(iii)

None of the acts by the bankruptcy trustees and the courts amounted to denial
of justice.

The FET standard in this BIT does not include an additional obligation to
ensure a fully effective remedy against all harm, such that deteriorating assets
embroiled in contested ownership claims during bankruptcy proceedings will
be fully preserved and returned unharmed to their ultimate owner, even in
circumstances where bankruptcy estates have insufficient assets to forestall
deterioration; and as such,

Claimant has failed to prove the breach of FET standard.

Because the Tribunal has found no breach of the BIT (either its provisions on
expropriation, FET or FPS, discussed in Sections II.5, II.6 and III.7
respectively), there is no need to consider whether Claimant has sufficiently
proven harm resulting from such breach. However, the Tribunal notes that
there were significant problems with Claimant’s case on causation and
quantum, as noted in the Separate Declaration of Professor Alexandrov.

IV. Costs

The issues

The last question that the Arbitral Tribunal has to decide upon concerns the costs of

the arbitration proceedings.

The Parties’ positions

Claimant’s position

In its last written submission (Reply, p. 28), Claimant requested the following relief:

(Claim. 7.2] Each Party shall bear its own costs of legal representation and the costs

of the arbitrator appointed by it. Both Parties shall share the costs of
the Chairman of the arbitration tribunal equally. While Claimant will
accept to carry its own costs in case of an award in its favour, it won't
agree to support Respondent's costs in case of an award in favour of
the latter. Should the Arbitral Tribunal decide otherwise, the costs
incurred to Claimant in the amount of 1,127,924.90 EUR should be
borne by Respondent (Claimant's Statement of Cost of 25 September
2019).

717.

718.

Claimant reiterated its position in further submissions (Letter dated 17 April 2020).

Respondent’s position

In its last written submission (Rejoinder para. 51), Respondent requested the following
relief:

[Resp. 3] In any event, order Claimant to fully reimburse the Czech Republic for
the costs it has incurred in defending its interests in this arbitration,
plus interest on any costs at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal.

In the Submission on Costs dated 22 February 2019, Respondent argues that Claimant
failed to “orderly prosecute its claims” for the following reasons:

(a) _ by initiating this arbitration even though (1) “it did not have the financial means
to see it through to its end”; and (2) the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under an
intra-EU BIT;

(b) by refusing to pay its share of the deposit and by ignoring the Tribunal’s
procedural instructions on several occasions.

Based on the above, and considering the fact that Respondent’s costs are reasonable,
Respondent argues that the Tribunal should apply Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL
Rules and order Claimant to bear all costs (Submission on Costs dated
22 February 2019.

The Arbitral Tribunal’s analysis

Article 10 para. 2 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT, in connection with the
arbitration proceedings initiated by an investor against a State, reads as follows: “[...]
In the absence of any other arrangement between the parties to the dispute, the
provisions of article 9, paragraphs 3 to 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis [...]”.

Article 9 para. 5 of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT addresses the disputes between
the Contracting Parties (the States) and in this regards reads as follows:

[...] Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member and of its legal
representation in the arbitration proceedings. The costs of the chairman and any
other costs shall be shared equally between the two Contracting Parties. The
tribunal may determine a different allocation of costs. [...].

The Parties have not expressly adopted “any other arrangement”. However it has been
agreed that the proceedings shall be submitted to the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules (PO 1, para. 7).

112

719.

720.

3.1

3.11

(a)

721.

722.

In those Rules, the principle is expressed by Article 40 that reads as follows:

1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and,
if it deems appropriate, in another decision.

2. The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with
article 41;

(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

z

(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required
by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such
expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the
arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the
amount of such costs is reasonable;

() Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees
and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.

It appears from this text that the Arbitral Tribunal should distinguish between the costs
of the arbitral proceedings as such and the costs incurred by the Parties.

The costs of the arbitral proceedings
The Arbitral Tribunal

The fees of the Arbitrators

Articles 9 and 10 of the BIT do not address the description of the costs. The Arbitral
Tribunal considers that it may apply Article 40(2)(a) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules.
According to that provision, the fees of the Arbitral Tribunal are to be fixed separately
as to each arbitrator. According to Article 41 of the Rules, “[t]he fees and expenses of
the arbitrators shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in
dispute, the complexity of the subject matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any
other relevant circumstances of the case.”

The Parties have agreed with the Arbitral Tribunal that the arbitrators would work at
an hourly rate of USD 700 per hour. The arbitrators’ fees for the proceedings have
been fixed finally as follows:

This amount seems reasonable in view of the amount in dispute, the complexity of the
issues and the time spent.

Except for the legal and other costs incurred by the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal
will discuss further, there were no other costs (neither experts nor witnesses whose
costs were borne by the Arbitral Tribunal).

The Permanent Court of Arbitration

Pursuant to the Terms of Appointment of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the
International Bureau of the PCA was designated to act as registry in this arbitration.
Total PCA fees amount to USD 22,368.93. The PCA incurred no expenses.

Summary

Summing up the overall costs of the arbitral proceedings are the following:
USD 800,000.

The Parties have first paid advance deposits of USD 400,000 each, amounting in total
to USD 800,000.

On 10 April 2020, in view of the financial situation, the Arbitral Tribunal invited each
party to pay a supplementary deposit of USD 30,000 each. Respondent made the
requested payment. Claimant did not pay.

The Arbitral Tribunal has decided to forego using the supplementary amount in order
to be able to finalise the proceedings. Therefore the amount of USD 30,000 paid by
Respondent will be reimbursed to it.

Allocation of the costs

According to Articles 9 and 10 of the BIT, each Party shall bear the fees and expenses
of the Arbitrator it has appointed and bear half of the fees and expenses of the Presiding
arbitrator. However the rule also states that [t]he tribunal may determine a different
allocation of costs.

According to Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules:

“1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of
such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate,
in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to
another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.”

The Arbitral Tribunal has taken into consideration the following circumstances:

115

732.

3.3

733.

734.

735.

— On the merits, Claimant is the “unsuccessful party”, as far as its claims have
indeed been rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal. It should therefore “in principle”
bear the costs of the arbitration.

— However, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the substantial objections raised by
Respondent as to jurisdiction have all been rejected. It follows that Respondent
is the “unsuccessful party” with respect to issues of jurisdiction, and therefore
should bear part of the costs of arbitration as well.

- Moreover, even on the merits, the Arbitral Tribunal considers, in view of the
complexity and the particularity of the case, which raised questions that were
very disputable, that it would be unfair for either Party to bear more than half of
the costs of the proceeding.

— The Arbitral Tribunal considers that it would be more appropriate to follow the
general practice, according to which each Party shall bear half of the total costs.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that the Parties shall bear equally the costs of
the proceeding, i.e., each Party shall bear USD 400,000.

Indemnity of the Parties

According to Article 9 para. 5 of the BIT, applicable by reference to Article 10,
“{ejontracting Party shall bear the costs [...] of its legal representation in the
arbitration proceedings. Article 40(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules mentions as one of
the element of the costs of arbitration consists in “the legal and other costs incurred
by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal
determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable”.

The Parties have been invited to submit their statement of costs by a letter dated
17 April 2020.

Claimant requests the following amount, excluding the advance paid to the Arbitral
Tribunal:

The Arbitral Tribunal has given the reasons for which it considers that each Party shall
bear an equal part of the costs of the proceedings. It appears to it that these grounds
should also be decisive in declining to order the indemnity that each Party requests
with respect to its own costs.

In light of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal considers it appropriate for each Party to
bear its own costs.

Conclusions

In light of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal decides the following:
(i) Each Party shall bear half of the cost of the proceedings, i.e. USD 400,000.

(ii) The supplementary deposit of USD 30,000 paid by Respondent is to be
returned to it.

SEPARATE DECLARATION

Stanimir A. Alexandrov
May 11, 2020

I agree with most of the analysis and conclusions of the Award. My views, however,
differ from those of my esteemed colleagues on several important points.

Expropriation: The Award concludes in para. 628 that there was no expropriation
because, inter alia, Claimant does not argue that Respondent’s actions had an expropriatory
intent (iii); and that both the bankruptcy trustees and the Czech courts acted in accordance
with Czech law and therefore lawfully (iv).

I do not believe that the question whether there was an intent to expropriate is
determinative. Whether there was an expropriation is a question of result, of effect, not a
question of intent or purpose. Further, the question of whether the bankruptcy trustees and
the courts acted in accordance with Czech law is, of course, relevant, but not dispositive. It
is entirely possible that a host State’s conduct is in full compliance with its domestic laws,
yet inconsistent with international law and in breach of the BIT. Thus, to conclude that the
trustees and the courts acted in accordance with Czech law and therefore lawfully under
international law is incorrect.

In my view, the correct analysis is to look at the effect of Respondent’s conduct.
Claimant’s aircraft were included in the bankruptcy estates and sold. As the Czech courts
themselves ultimately concluded, the aircraft should not have been included in the
bankruptcy estates in the first place. Claimant received the value of the sold aircraft. The
analysis should focus on the difference between that sale value and the value of the aircraft at
the time of the sequestration.

The Award appears to recognize that this is the proper analysis by referring to “the
difference in value between the time of their lawful sequestration and their lawful sale” (para.
628(vi)). However, it concludes earlier (para. 628(i)) that “[t]he temporary sequestration of
disputed assets during the course of bankruptcy proceedings can amount to expropriation
only if ... upon determination that the asset does not properly belong in the bankruptcy
estate, the assets (or their fair value at the time of such determination) are nonetheless not
returned to the owner.” In my view, this is not the correct standard. The question is rather
whether there was a substantial loss of value between (i) the time of the sequestration and (ii)
the time of the sale (and the corresponding return of the proceeds to Claimant).

I believe that the Award should have examined Claimant’s arguments relating to the
value of the aircraft at the time of the sequestration, should have determined what that value

was, should have compared that value with the amount received by Claimant as a result of
the sale, and should have determined on that basis whether there was a substantial
deprivation of value. If so, then the Award should have turned to causation.

Just and equitable treatment (FET): The Award concludes in para. 709 that (i)
“Claimant has not demonstrated any arbitrary, abusive, or discriminatory conduct on the part
of either the bankruptcy trustees or the Czech courts, nor that either the trustees or the Czech
courts violated its legitimate expectations regarding the protections afforded by the Czech
legal system”; (ii) “[n]one of the acts by the bankruptcy trustees and the courts amounted to
denial of justice;” and (iii) “[t]he FET standard in this BIT does not include an additional
obligation to ensure a fully effective remedy against all harm...”. I agree with conclusion (ii)
that there was no denial of justice in this case. My view differs, however, with respect to
conclusions (i) and (iii).

Conclusion (i) lists some elements, such as abusive, arbitrary or discriminatory
conduct, or undermining the investor’s legitimate expectations, which — if proven — would
constitute unjust and inequitable treatment. But these are not the only elements of the FET
standard. Article 2(1) of the BIT requires that Respondent “in all cases afford investments
just and equitable treatment.” This standard cannot be reduced to a list of types or categories
of conduct. The treaty standard remains just and equitable treatment.'! To determine what is
just and equitable, and what is unjust and inequitable, requires an assessment of the overall
treatment afforded to the investor, rather than an assessment of each individual act or
omission. If the overall result of such treatment is unjust or inequitable, the FET protection
will have been breached.

A violation of the BIT could result from the combination of administrative actions
(such as those of the bankruptcy trustees) and the failure of the judiciary to correct them even
though none of the administrative actions or the court decisions, taken separately, would rise
to the level of a breach of FET. The totality of the acts and omissions of a respondent, the
whole course of a respondent’s conduct, including the decisions of its court, may well result
in a finding of a treaty violation? The relevant question, therefore, should be whether the
conduct of the bankruptcy trustees and the courts as a whole resulted in treatment that was
unjust or inequitable. I conclude that it did.

In the end the Czech courts sided with Claimant. As the Award rightly observes in
para. 703, “in the end, Claimant was adjudged to be right in its claim of ownership, but this
vindication came too late for it to regain possession and control of the aircraft.” None of the
individual decisions of the bankruptcy trustees or the Czech courts may have been incorrect
as a matter of Czech law. However, the treatment of Claimant (the combination of the acts
or omissions of the bankruptcy trustees and the courts), resulted in an outcome that was
unfair to Claimant. At different times different courts ruled that the aircraft should be

included in, or should be excluded from, the bankruptcy estates; the sale of the aircraft
without Claimant’s consent was sometimes allowed and sometimes prohibited. At the end of
this long saga, Claimant prevailed; its rights were, in the end, vindicated, but it was too late —
Claimant had lost the asset. This treatment, as a whole, is hardly just and equitable.

  

Conclusion (iii) focuses on the absence of an explicit requirement (present in other
BITs) that the judiciary must provide an effective remedy from the actions of State organs
and declines to read into the BIT such a requirement. The absence of such an explicit
requirement, however, does not mean that an investor left without an effective remedy is
treated justly and equitably, as required by Article 2(1) of the BIT.

In this case, the Czech courts eventually ruled that the aircraft should not have been
included in the bankruptcy estates. The aircraft were included in the bankruptcy estates, in
the first place, by the bankruptcy trustees, whose actions were attributable to Respondent.
After a lengthy process, that inclusion was “undone” by the courts as a matter of Czech law;
Claimant, however, remained without a remedy — Claimant received the sale value of the
aircraft, which Claimant argues was significantly less than the value at the time of the
sequestration. Thus, Respondent did not provide an effective remedy for its own actions,
which cannot be just and equitable.

Valuation: In sum, my conclusion is that Respondent is liable for breaches of the BIT.
Where Claimant’s case may fall is on valuation.

It is Claimant’s burden to prove that the value of the aircraft at the time of the
sequestration in the fall of 2005 was substantially higher than the amount it received after the
sale. I have some difficulties with Claimant’s arguments on this point. First, it seems
unclear why there would be separate claims for actual damages and future lost profits, as
Claimant appears to argue in its written submissions, given that the price of an arms-length
transaction (such as the sale of the aircraft) would typically include the asset’s revenue-
generating potential. At the hearing, Claimant appeared to argue that its damages claim
consisted of the lost profits and the residual value of the aircraft (Transcript, pages 121-122),
which I believe to be a reasonable argument. Yet, it still leaves open the question why the
sale of the aircraft (presumably a “willing seller — willing buyer” transaction) would not
capture both the expected future profits and any residual value.

Second, Claimant relies on several documents for the value of the aircraft at or around
the time of the sequestration, which do not appear to fully support its claims. One example is
the Euro-Trend report (Exhibit C-49), on which Claimant relies to assert a value of $27.2
million as of June 2006 (Amended Statement of Claim, para. 617). However, that report
acknowledges that it is based on several untested assumptions. Further, the report appears to
calculate the value of the aircraft within a range of $20.1 - $22.4 million (Exhibit C-49, page
22), rather than the $27 million asserted by Claimant, and also states that an amount of
almost $5 million would be needed for maintenance before recommissioning the aircraft
(pages 22-23). Finally, the report values the aircraft rather than Claimant’s interest in them
and assumes that Claimant’s ownership was free from any liens. There is also a serious
question as to whether Claimant has met its burden to rebut Respondent’s criticism of

Claimant’s reliance on this report and on other similar reports and purchase offers (Statement
of Defense, paras. 481-492).

In sum, a careful analysis of Claimant’s arguments on valuation may lead to the

conclusion that Claimant did not meet its burden to prove the existence of harm and to
quantify it.
