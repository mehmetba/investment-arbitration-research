L INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between the
Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the Promotion and Protection of Investments
dated October 3, 1991 (the “Treaty”), which entered into force on September 28, 1992, and the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”). The dispute
relates to Claimants’ allegations that Respondent has violated the Treaty, international law, and
Argentine law, as well as commitments and representations made by Respondent to Claimants, by
unlawfully re-nationalizing and taking other measures regarding Claimants’ investments in two
Argentine airlines: Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (“ARSA”) and Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A.
(“AUSA”) (collectively, the “Airlines” or the “Argentine Airlines”) and their subsidiaries.

Respondent also makes a Counterclaim.

2. Claimants are Teinver S.A. (“Teinver”), Transportes de Cercanias S.A. (“Transportes de
Cercanias”) and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. (“Autobuses Urbanos”) (collectively,

“Claimants”).
3. Claimants are companies incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain.

4. Respondent is the Argentine Republic and is hereinafter also referred to as “Argentina” or

the “Respondent.”

5. Claimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The
Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

IL. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration

6. On December 12, 2008, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated December 11, 2008

from Claimants against Respondent (the “Request” or “RFA”).

Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.
v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1)

 

Award

7. The RFA invoked Respondent’s advance consent to ICSID arbitration contained in the
Treaty, and by way of a most-favored-nation (“MFN”) clause in the Treaty, the dispute settlement
provisions in the 1991 Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic
Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (the “US-Argentina

BIT”), which entered into force on October 20, 1994.

8. On January 30, 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration.
In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to
constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre’s

Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

B. Constitution of the Tribunal

9. By letter dated April 3, 2009, Claimants informed the Centre that they had selected the
method envisaged in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the constitution of the Tribunal
(i.e. the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the

third, who would be the president of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties).

10. On April 27, 2009, Claimants informed the Centre of their appointment of Mr. Henri C.
Alvarez Q.C., a Canadian national, as an arbitrator. Mr. Alvarez accepted his appointment on

May 4, 2009.

11. On May 12, 2009, Claimants requested ICSID to appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed
and to designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal in this case, pursuant to Article
38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration

Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”).

12. On June 1, 2009, Respondent appointed Dr. Kamal Hossain, a Bangladeshi national, as an

arbitrator. Dr. Hossain accepted his appointment on June 6, 2009.

Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.
v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1)

 

Award

13. By letters of June 15, 2009, August 3, 2009, September 29, 2009, and November 2, 2009,
the Centre consulted with the Parties in connection with the appointment of the arbitrator not yet

appointed, as envisaged in Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4.

14. By letter of December 14, 2009, the Centre informed the Parties that, pursuant to Article 38
of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4, ICSID was to propose to the Chairman of
the ICSID Administrative Council the appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal, a U.S. national,

as the President of the Tribunal.

15. On December 21, 2009, both Parties informed ICSID that they did not have any
observations on the proposed appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal as President of the

Tribunal.

16. On December 28, 2009, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed
Judge Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal. Judge Buergenthal accepted his

appointment on December 30, 2009.

17. The Tribunal is composed of Thomas Buergenthal (U.S.), President, appointed by the
Chairman of the Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention;
Henri C. Alvarez (Canadian), appointed by Claimants; and Kamal Hossain (Bangladeshi),

appointed by Respondent.

18. On January 4, 2010, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration
Rule 6(1), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that
the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Sergio Puig, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

Cc. Written and Oral Phases of the Proceeding

19. The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on March 22, 2010 at the World Bank
Conference Center in Paris. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted
and reached agreements on several procedural matters, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration

Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, and that the procedural languages would be

Award

English and Spanish. It was also agreed that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C.
The agreement of the Parties was embodied in Minutes of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal

signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and circulated to the Parties.

20. On September 17, 2010, Claimants requested a one-week extension for the filing of their
Memorial on the Merits. On September 20, 2010, Respondent informed that it had no objection to
the extension requested by Claimants. As a result, Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits, with
accompanying documentation, on September 29, 2010. The accompanying documentation
included the witness statements of Messrs. Gerardo Diaz Ferran, Gonzalo Pascual Arias, Carlos

Bastos; and the Expert Report of Pablo Spiller and Manuel Abdala from LECG.

21. By letter of November 10, 2010, the Parties were informed that Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-

Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Counsel, would replace Mr. Sergio Puig as Secretary of the Tribunal.

22. Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction on December 6, 2010, following the
Tribunal’s agreement to Respondent’s extension request of November 24, 2010. The
accompanying documentation included the witness statements of Messrs. Juan de Dios Cincunegui

and Rafael Llorens; and the Expert Reports of Dr. Ismael Mata, and Professor Agusto Nissen.

23. Claimants’ Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction was subsequently filed on January 24, 2011,

which included the Witness Statement of Vicente Mufioz Pérez.

24. On February 4, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, ruling that Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections would be dealt with as a preliminary question, and that the proceeding on
the merits was accordingly suspended. The Tribunal also decided that a second round of pleadings

on jurisdiction would be filed.

25. On February 9, 2011, Respondent filed a request for production of documents. This was
followed by Claimants’ observations of February 14, 2011, Respondent’s response of February 21,
2011, and Claimants’ reply of February 28, 2011. On March 1, 2011, the Tribunal issued a decision

on production of documents.

26. On March 10, 2011, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction with the second witness
statements of Messrs. Juan de Dios Cincunegui and Rafael Llorens; and the second Expert Report

of Dr. Ismael Mata and the Expert Report of Mr. Virgilio Ivan Hernandez Urraburu.

27. On April 12, 2011, Claimants filed an application for Provisional Measures (the
“Application for Provisional Measures” or “the Application”), including a request for an
emergency temporary order, prohibiting the Argentine Republic from adopting certain tax

measures until the Tribunal decided on the Request.

28. On April 13, 2011, the Tribunal invited Respondent’s comments on Claimants’ request for
an emergency temporary order by April 20, 2011. The Tribunal also invited: (i) Respondent to
file observations on Claimants’ Request by April 27, 2011; (ii) Claimants to file observations in
reply by May 4, 2011; and (iii) Respondent to file observations by way of rejoinder by May 11,
2011. The deadlines for the filings concerning the Request were later extended on April 27, 2011.

29. On April 20, 2011, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimants’ Request for Urgent
Provisional Measures, requesting that it should be dismissed for the reasons stated in that

submission.

30. On April 27, 2011, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, along with the second
Witness Statement of Vicente Mufioz Pérez and the Expert Legal Opinion of Judge Stephen M.
Schwebel.

31. On April 29, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, concerning Claimants’
request for provisional measures. In its Procedural Order No. 2, “/t/he Tribunal, after careful

consideration, unanimously decided as follows:

a) The Claimants’ request for an emergency temporary order is denied. Having heard from both
parties, the Tribunal is not persuaded, given in particular the Respondent’s assertions in paragraphs
6 through 8 of its submission of April 20, 2011, that there is an urgency that would warrant such an
order.

b) The Tribunal notes that a hearing is scheduled to be held on May 27-31, 2011, during which, the
parties will have the opportunity to fully present their arguments on this matter. The Tribunal will
decide on the Claimants Application shortly thereafter.

c) The parties are invited to refrain from aggravating or extending the dispute; and

d) Either party may bring to the Tribunal’s attention, any new, relevant, facts that may emerge
fundamentally changing the current circumstances.

32. Also on April 29, 2011, Claimants renewed their request for an emergency, temporary
order. In their request, Claimants submitted that their Argentine subsidiary and holder of the title
to the Airlines’ shares, Interinvest S.A. (“Interinvest”), had been served on April 28, 2011 with a
notice for immediate payment of approximately USD 663,944.25 (ARS 2,706,236.90) due to the
Argentine tax authority (“AFIP”). Claimants further indicated that such notice constituted the very
subject matter of Claimants’ application for an emergency temporary order and for provisional

measures in this arbitration.

33. On April 29, 2011, Respondent filed its Response to Claimants’ Request for Provisional
Measures. This was followed by a response on May 4, 2011 to Claimants’ letter of April 29, 2011.
On May 6, 2011, Claimants filed Claimants’ Reply in Support of their Request for Provisional
Measures. Respondent subsequently filed on May 13, 2011, its Rejoinder on Claimants’ Request

for Provisional Measures.

34. On May 13, 2011, the Tribunal decided on Claimants’ request for an Emergency
Temporary Order of April 29, 2011, as follows:

After careful consideration, and in light of the proximity of the hearing to be held on May 27-31,

2011, the Tribunal has determined that at this time there is no imminent, or no sufficiently imminent,

threat between now and the hearing. Accordingly, the Tribunal has denied Claimants’ request for
an Emergency Temporary Order of April 29, 2011.

The Tribunal would like to once again invite the parties to (i) refrain from aggravating or extending

the dispute, and (ii) bring to the Tribunal’s attention, any new, relevant, facts that may emerge
fundamentally changing the current circumstances.

35. A hearing on Jurisdiction and Provisional Measures was held at the seat of the Centre in
Washington, D.C. from May 27-31, 2011. In attendance were the three members of the Tribunal,
Judge Thomas Buergenthal, Mr. Henri C. Alvarez and Dr. Kamal Hossain. In the absence of
Ms. Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Mr. Gonzalo Flores, and Ms. A. Catherine Kettlewell, Counsel,

42. On November 8, 2011, Claimants provided their comments to Respondent’s submission of
October 26, 2011, requesting the Tribunal to disregard Argentina’s new arguments and expert

reports, and to affirm jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims.
43. By letter of December 15, 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties:

The Tribunal, having reviewed Respondent's letter of October 26, 2011 and Claimants’ letter of
November 8, 2011, has taken note of the arguments made therein as they relate to the pleadings on
Jurisdiction, with the exception of the expert report of the Spanish attorney, Mr. Juan Antonio
Cabezudo Alvarez, attached to Respondent's letter, and Respondent’s arguments based thereon. The
Tribunal has made this determination without prejudice to the excluded material being resubmitted
to the Tribunal by Respondent at a later stage of these proceedings, if any.

44. By letter December 15, 2011, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to file the
dissenting opinions issued by Prof. Brigitte Stern, Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C. and Prof.
Georges Abi-Saab in Impregilo v. Argentina, Hochtief v. Argentina, and Abaclat v. Argentina,
respectively. Respondent argued that Claimants had not filed such opinions when they filed the
Impregilo award, and the Decisions on Jurisdiction in Hochtief and in Abaclat. On December 20,
2011, considering that Claimants had informed the Tribunal that they had no comments on
Respondent’s request of December 15, 2011, the Tribunal granted Respondent’s request.

Respondent subsequently filed the dissenting opinions on December 22, 2011.

45. On February 17, 2012, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the
record the recently adopted decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit in the case of Republic of Argentina v. BG Group plc of January 17, 2012, and
in the JCS v. Argentine Republic case'. The request was granted on February 22, 2012, and the
Tribunal provided Claimants with the opportunity to make a submission in response of the same

length as Respondent’s request. Claimants filed their response on February 28, 2012.

46. On March 22, 2012, the Tribunal advised the Parties that the Tribunal did not require, nor

would it accept, further submissions unless specifically requested by the Tribunal.

meeting to be scheduled in this respect; and

 

Authorize Claimants’ representatives in Interinvest to attend, participate and/or exercise their voting
rights in the shareholders meeting that will presumably be scheduled in connection with the alleged
“adjustments” to the Argentine Airlines financial statements, and in all cases free of any coercion,
or physical or legal threat.

49. In their Application of March 26, 2012, Claimants further requested that the Tribunal or its
President immediately issue an emergency, temporary order to preserve the status quo (i.e., the
situation that exists at this date) with respect to all the financial statements, until such time as it

tules on this Request for provisional measures.

50. By letter of March 27, 2012, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimants’
Application of March 26, 2012, for an emergency temporary order, on or before April 4, 2012.

On October 3, 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, concerning Claimants’

Tribunal decided as follows:

60.

a) The Tribunal rejects Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures in its entirety.
b) The Tribunal reminds the Parties that they are obligated to refrain from aggravating the dispute.

c) The Tribunal reserves its decision on the costs of the procedure relating to the Application for
Provisional Measures to a later stage of this arbitration.

Also on October 3, 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, concerning

a) Having been rendered moot by the approval of the 2008 Financial Statements on June 1, 2012,
the Claimants’ Second Application for Provisional Measures, including its request for an emergency
temporary order, is denied.

b) The Tribunal notes that it had explicitly instructed both Parties on April 1, 2012 to take no actions

be material for the determination by the Tribunal of Respondent’s Fourth Objection on Jurisdiction

concerning the legality of Claimants’ Investment.

63. On December 7, 2012, Claimants filed a letter requesting that Respondent’s submission be
dismissed because in Claimants’ view it was untimely, violated Tribunal orders and was irrelevant
to the jurisdictional phase of this case as it was based on facts alleged to have occurred after
Argentina’s expropriation of Claimants’ investment, and was unrelated to the Airlines, Argentina

or Argentine law.

64. By letter of December 17, 2012, the Tribunal reminded the Parties that by letter of March
22, 2012, they were advised that the Tribunal did not require, nor would accept, further
submissions unless specifically requested by the Tribunal. As a result, the Tribunal did not admit
Respondent’s submission of December 6, 2012 at that stage, noting that if Respondent wished to
raise those matters as part of its counter-memorial on the merits, it might do so in that filing as

might be relevant.

to the Decision was a separate opinion by arbitrator Dr. Kamal Hossain. The Tribunal rejected the

separate opinion are attached to this Award, and form an integral part of it.

74. On May 24, 2013, after considering Respondent’s observations of May 13, 2013, and
Claimants’ response of May 17, 2013, the Tribunal decided on Claimants’ request for production

of documents.

response to Claimants’ Application was scheduled for August 12, 2015.

110. On August 12, 2015, Respondent filed its Response to Claimants’ Application. In its prayer

111. On September 8, 2015, the Tribunal invited Claimants to (i) file observations on

114. On September 16, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the deadline for the filing
of Claimants’ response to Respondent's letter of August 12, 2015 was suspended until the Tribunal
issued directions on Claimants’ Production Request. The Tribunal also requested that Respondent
advise the Tribunal by September 18, 2015 whether and how quickly it could provide a copy of
the PROCELAC Complaint to Claimants.

115. Also on September 16, 2015, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Tribunal’s request
had been transmitted to the PROCELAC, given that the Argentine Treasury Attorney General’s
Office was not in possession of a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint.

116. On September 23, 2015, the Tribunal invited (i) Respondent to inform the Tribunal by
September 25, 2015, whether it had received any response from the PROCELAC on the Tribunal’s
request for a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint; and (ii) Claimants to provide a response by

September 28, 2015, should the Tribunal determine that a hearing on Claimants’ Application was

required.

117. On September 24, 2015, Respondent submitted PROCELAC’s response on the Tribunal’s
request for a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint dated September 18, 2015. In its response, the
head of PROCELAC indicated that because the PROCELAC Complaint had been filed with the
court, pursuant to Article 204 of Argentina’s Code of Criminal Procedure (the “ACCP”), no copy

of such complaint could be provided.

118. On that same date, both Parties confirmed their availability to hold a hearing on Claimants’

Application during November 3 and/or 4, 2015, in Washington, D.C.

2015 constituted their Reply in Claimants’ Application or whether they still wished to submit a
full Reply; and (iii) Claimants to respond to Respondent’s request for the admission of the two

new documents set out in paragraph 81(c) of Respondent’s Response.

121. On October 6, 2015, Claimants submitted their reply to the Tribunal’s letter of October 2,
2015, noting that they wished to submit a full Reply and, for reasons of expediency, did not oppose
the incorporation into the arbitral record of the two new documents set out in paragraph 81(c) of

Respondent’s Response of August 12, 2015.

122. On that same date, Respondent submitted its reply to the Tribunal’s letter of October 2,
2015, reiterating its inability to produce the PROCELAC Complaint and providing details
permitting identification of the relevant domestic court to which the PROCELAC Complaint had

been submitted.

123. By letter of October 8, 2015, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties’ respective
letters of October 6, 2015. It further acknowledged receipt on October 6, 2015, of the Spanish
translation of Claimants’ letter of September 29, 2015, and on October 7, 2015, of the English

translation of Respondent's letter of October 6, 2015.

124. In the same letter, the Tribunal, among other things: (i) set deadlines for a second round of
written submissions, (ii) scheduled a hearing on Claimants’ Application for November 3, 2015, at
the seat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington, D.C. (the

“PM Hearing”), and (iii) provided the Hearing schedule and related logistics information.

125. In accordance with the procedural schedule, on October 14, 2015, Claimants filed their

135. By letter of November 18, 2015, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that,
due to personal commitments, his Assistant, Ms. Annalise Nelson, would be replaced by Ms. Jill
Goldenziel. Ms. Goldenziel’s curriculum vitae was attached, and the Parties were invited to inform

the Tribunal by November 20, 2015, if they had any objection.

136. On November 20, 2015, both Parties expressed having no objections to the appointment of
Ms. Goldenziel as Assistant to the President. As a result, by letter of November 23, 2015, the

Parties were informed of Ms. Goldenziel’s appointment.

137. By letter of December 1, 2015, Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had recently
learned that ARSA’s CEO had called for a shareholders’ meeting on December 9, 2015, in order
to consider, among other issues, the transfer of the shares to the National State. In their letter,
Claimants noted that, as already explained, the expropriation proceeding in Argentina had not
ended, because Interinvest had not been notified of the alleged rejection of its pending appeal
before the Supreme Court. Accordingly, in Claimants’ view, Interinvest continued to hold and

should continue to hold title to the shares of both ARSA and AUSA.

138. On December 2, 2015, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimants’

communication of December 1, 2015 by December 7, 2015.

139. On December 4, 2015, Respondent responded to Claimants’ communication of

December 1, 2015.

140. On December 9, 2015, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal was in receipt of both
Claimants’ communication of December 1, 2015, and Respondent’s response of December 4,

2015, and had taken note of their contents.

141. On January 4, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties and to the
Tribunal Members a copy of a letter from the Secretary-General of ICSID dated December 23,
2015, acknowledging receipt of a letter from the Argentine Republic of December 22, 2015,

informing of the appointment of Dr. Carlos Francisco Balbin as Argentina’s Treasury Attorney

General, following the resignation of Dra. Angelina Maria Esther Abbona. In its communication,
Argentina additionally informed that Dr. Horacio Pedro Diez and Dr. Javier Pargament Mariasch

had also submitted their resignations from their positions as Deputy Treasury Attorney General.

142. On February 25, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal, on instructions of the President,
informed the Parties that the Tribunal’s Decision on Claimants’ Third Request for Provisional
Measures was ready in its English version, which had been sent for its translation into Spanish. It
was further indicated that, unless the Parties requested otherwise, the Tribunal would issue its

Decision in both languages simultaneously.

143. On February 26, 2016, Claimants requested that the English version of the Tribunal’s
Decision on Claimants’ Third Request for Provisional Measures be sent first, without waiting for
the Spanish version. On the same date, Respondent requested that the Decision be issued

simultaneously in both languages.

144. By letter of March 8, 2016, Claimants brought to the Tribunal’s attention a new
development, the signing by the Argentina’s President of Decree 294/2016 of February 2, 2016,
derogating the cap on domestic airfares (that is, the maximum airfare), requesting the Tribunal to
take this new development into account when rendering the award and in allocating the costs of

this arbitration.

145. On March 9, 2016, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimants’ letter of

March 8, 2016 by March 16, 2016.

146. Also, on March 9, 2016, Respondent requested an extension of the deadline to comment
on Claimants’ letter of March 8, 2016, until March 21, 2016, in light of a number of submissions

that it needed to make in other cases. On the same date, the Tribunal granted the extension.

147. On March 21, 2016, Respondent submitted its response to Claimants’ correspondence of

March 8, 2016.

148. On March 29, 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was in receipt of the Parties’
recent correspondence concerning the derogation of the cap on domestic airfares in Argentina, and

had taken note of their contents.

149. On April 8, 2016, the Tribunal issued its Decision of Claimants’ Third Application for

 

Provisional Measures (“Decision on Provisional Measures of April 8, 2016”). In its Decision, the

Tribunal held the following:

The Tribunal:

a) orders that refrain from icizing the C ints or the criminal i igation and
any relation they may have to this arbitration, whether by communications to the press or otherwise;

b) defers its decision in respect of Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures as it relates to
the suspension of the criminal proceedings in regard of counsel for Claimants and Claimants’ court-
appointed receivers, with liberty to Claimants to bring this Application back before the Tribunal in
this respect should it become necessary;

 

c) reminds the Parties that they are obligated to refrain from aggravating the dispute;
d) denies the remaining aspects of Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures; and

e) reserves its decision on the costs of the procedure relating to Claimants’ Application for
Provisional Measures to the final award.

150. Attached to the Tribunal’s Decision of April 8, 2016, was a Dissenting Opinion by
Dr. Kamal Hossain. In his Dissent, Dr. Hossain expressed his disagreement around setting out of
contentious factual positions, which he considered were not necessary for the order made and
conveyed the erroneous impression that those issues might be treated as settled. His objections
also related to some issues, which he categorized as preliminary, fundamental and unresolved,
which in his view had to be dealt with in the award on the merits upon consideration of the evidence

on record.

151. By letter of September 29, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal, on instructions of the

President of the Tribunal, informed the Parties on the status of the Award:

    

An advanced draft of the Tribunal’s Award has been under discussion. The Tribunal Members.
deliberated in person and by other means, and have exchanged several thorough notes expressi
their particular, and sometimes opposed views on several key issues. The Tribunal is aware that the
Parties have been waiting for a long period of time for the Tribunal’s Award. The Tribunal is also
fully aware how important this case is for the Parties. It therefore regrets the delay very much. As

 

28

the Parties know, however, this is a complicated case that requires the Tribunal to consider a vast
factual background, extensive submissions, massive volume of documents and very complex legal
issues in dispute.

  

The Tribunal wishes to assure the Parties that it is doing its very best to finalize the Award as soon
as possible.

152. By letter of October 4, 2016, Claimants requested that the proceeding be closed pursuant
to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).

153. On October 17, 2016, Respondent filed a letter requesting leave from the Tribunal to file a
document relating to the Public Prosecutor’s classification of the insolvency proceedings of

Transporte de Cercanias, S.A. as “culpable”.

154. On October 19, 2016, the Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent’s request

of October 17, 2016, for the Tribunal to decide on admissibility of new evidence.

155. On October 24, 2016, Claimants filed observations of Respondent’s request of October 17,
2016.

156. On October 26, 2016, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to respond to
Claimants’ letter of October 24, 2016. The Tribunal granted this request on October 27, 2016, and

Respondent submitted its response on November 1, 2016.

157. On November 4, 2016, Claimants filed a response to Respondent’s letter of November 1,

2016.

158. By letter of November 11, 2016, the Tribunal provided directions to the Parties and fixed
a procedural schedule for the submission by Respondent of the document in which the Public
Prosecutor classifies the nature of the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias, S.A.,
and for subsequent comments by Claimants. The Tribunal also acknowledged receipt of
Claimants’ letter of October 4, 2016, requesting that the proceeding be closed pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rule 38(1), a request that Claimants had ratified in their letters of October 24, 2016

and November 4, 2016. The Tribunal indicated that it would communicate separately the closure

of the proceeding once it had determined Respondent’s request of October 17, 2016 for the

admissibility of new evidence.

159. By letter of November 16, 2016, Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had no further
comments on Respondent’s request and repeated their request for the Tribunal to declare the
proceeding closed. This was followed by Respondent’s letter of November 17, 2016, informing
the Tribunal that it would transmit an English translation of the document from the Public

Prosecutor’s Office in the next few days. The translation was filed on November 21, 2016.

160. On November 29, 2016, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of a document dated February
29, 2016, issued by the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office of Madrid concerning the insolvency
proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias, S.A. Having considered the document in question, and
the Parties’ positions on the matter, the Tribunal, informed the Parties that after due deliberation,
it had decided to admit the document into the record on the basis that its relevance and weight

would be assessed by the Tribunal together with all of the evidence submitted.

161. In its letter of November 29, 2016, the Tribunal also invited the Parties to advise whether
they wished to submit updated statements of cost, and if so, to submit them simultaneously by

December 16, 2016.

162. On December 6, 2016, both Parties expressed their wish to submit updated statements of

costs. On December 16, 2016, as scheduled, each Party submitted an updated statement of costs.

163. On January 25, 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with
ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1). ICSID Arbitration Rule 46 provides that “[t]he award (including
any individual or dissenting opinion) shall be drawn up and signed within 120 days after closure
of the proceeding. The Tribunal may, however, extend this period by a further 60 days if it would
otherwise be unable to draw up the award.” On May 8, 2017, in accordance with Arbitration Rule
46, the Tribunal extended the period to draw up and sign the Award for a further 60 days (i.e., until
July 24, 2017).

Claimants are members of a group of companies known collectively as the “Marsans Group”.

165. As discussed in detail below,” in late 2001, Claimants Transportes de Cercanias and
Autobuses Urbanos, together with two other Marsans Group entities, acquired control of ARSA
and AUSA, which they purchased indirectly through their subsidiary Air Comet, a Spanish
company that in turn owned Interinvest, the Argentine holding company for the Airlines. In 2006,
Claimant Teinver acquired the 30% shareholding in Air Comet previously held by the other two

Marsans Group entities. The Claimants collectively owned 100% of the shares of Air Comet at

 

the time of filing of their claim.

166. Claimants’ claim in this arbitration can be divided into two components. First, Claimants
assert that Respondent unlawfully expropriated their investment in the Airlines at the end of 2008
through executive action and legislation that confiscated their shares in the Airlines. It is not
contested by either Party that Respondent paid a symbolic ARS | in compensation for Claimants’
shares in the Airlines. Claimants assert that Respondent’s expropriation of the Airlines constitutes

a violation of Article V of the Treaty.

167. Second, Claimants assert that before the formal expropriation of the Airlines took place in
2008, Respondent engaged in a series of acts that together constituted a creeping expropriation
under Article V of the Treaty. Claimants allege, in particular, that Respondent maintained airfares
at artificially low levels and prevented the Airlines from charging sufficient rates for airfares,
resulting in a financial squeeze that damaged both Claimants’ investment and the value of the
Airlines. This was done, according to Claimants, in order to force a distressed sale of the Airlines.

Claimants point to other alleged acts that they claim were part of a process of “re-Argentinization”

2 See IJ 176 to 183, below.

of the Airlines—acts designed to pressure Claimants into relinquishing their control of the
Airlines. These acts include the following:
The maintenance in office, despite a serious conflict of interest, of an Undersecretary of Air
Transportation who had formerly served as the head of a powerful air transportation union in
Argentina
Acts taken by the “government-supported” air transportation unions
Respondent's failure to comply with a number of agreements it entered with Claimants’ subsidiaries

between 2006 and 2008, including a memorandum of agreement for the sale of Claimant
in the Airlines to the Government of Argentina

 

168. Claimants allege that these and other acts constituted both creeping expropriation in
violation of Article V of the Treaty and constituted violations of the fair and equitable treatment
standard under Article IV(1) of the Treaty. Claimants also allege that Respondent failed to protect
their investment in Argentina, in violation of Article III(1) of the Treaty; that Respondent took
unjustified and/or discriminatory measures against Claimants, in violation of Article III(1) of the
Treaty; and that Respondent’s conduct amounts to a breach of the umbrella clause, invoked

through the MEN clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty.*

169. In the prayer for relief in their June 30, 2014 Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants request the

following:

A declaration that Argentina has violated the BIT;

A declaration that Argentina’s actions and omissions at issue and those of its instrumentalities for
which it is internationally responsible are unlawful, arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair and inequitable,
constitute an expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation without appropriate and timely
compensation, and that the GOA [Government of Argentina] failed to protect Claimants’ investment
and failed to fulfill obligations assumed with respect to the treatment of Claimants’ investments;

 

A declaration that the necessity defense does not apply;

An award to Claimants of restitution or the monetary equivalent of all damages caused to its
investments, including historical and consequential damages;

Pre-and-post award compound interest until the effective date of payment; and

5 Claimants assert that, through this MFN clause, they are entitled to the more favorable treatment accorded to investors
under Article II(2)(c) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which provides: “Each Party shall observe any obligation it may
have entered into with regard to investments.” Cl. Mem. { 488, citing C-348.

170. In this same prayer for relief, Claimants request compensation based on the unlawful
formal expropriation of their investment, as well as on the Treaty breaches that occurred prior to
formal expropriation. Claimants request a total amount of USD 1.59 billion for both Airlines

combined, calculated with interest through July 31, 2013.4

171. Respondent’s final prayer for relief contains, with respect to Claimants’ claim, a request
for the Tribunal:
(a) to declare that King & Spalding lacks the necessary legal capacity to represent Claimants in
this arbitration, which would result in the annulment of all actions taken, as well as to declare

the forfeiture of Claimants’ right to file an action;

(b) to reject all of the claims put forward by Claimants;

(d) to order Claimants to pay for all costs and expenses arising from this arbitration proceeding.
2. Respondent’s Counterclaim and Prayer for Relief

172. On May 6, 2013, Respondent submitted, along with its Counter-Memorial on Claimants’
claim, a Counterclaim against Claimants. This Counterclaim is based on the damage Respondent
alleges it has suffered due to Claimants’ administration of the Airlines between 2001 and 2008,
and the state of such companies as a consequence of such administration. Respondent asserts that
the Airlines were in a “state of almost total destruction and paralysation, after the stripping of
assets by the Marsans Group, which made the State comptrollership necessary to make the

operations of the flag carrier viable.”°
173. In the final prayer for relief in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent requests this Tribunal:

(c) to sustain the Counterclaim filed by the Argentine Republic, to award damages—plus pre-
and post-Award interest from the moment the Argentine Republic suffered the damage—as
well as to grant the Argentine Republic such further relief as the Tribunal may deem
appropriate;

Ill. PRELIMINARY ISSUES RELATED TO THE IDENTITY OF CLAIMANTS
A. Claimants’ Ownership of the Airlines

176. In 2001, the Airlines were owned by Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales
(“SEPT”), a holding company for all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish
government. SEPI owned the Airlines through an Argentine intermediary company called
Interinvest. SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest, and Interinvest in turn held 92.1% of ARSA’s shares
and 90% of AUSA’s shares.* On October 2, 2001, SEPI entered into a Share Purchase Agreement
(“SPA”) with the Spanish company, Air Comet, through which Air Comet acquired SEPI’s full
99.2% interest in Interinvest.’ It appears that Air Comet’s 99.2% interest in Interinvest, once
acquired, did not change during the period between its acquisition of Interinvest in 2001 and the

expropriation of Interinvest’s shares in the two Airlines by Argentina at the end of 2008.'°

177. | When the SPA was signed in October 2001, Air Comet was directly owned by two of the
three Claimants, Autobuses Urbanos (35%) and Transportes de Cercanias (35%), as well as by two
other Spanish companies, Proturin S.A. (29.8%) and Segetur S.A. (0.2%).!! Three of these four

companies signed the SPA as shareholders of Air Comet and expressly assumed the obligations of

shareholdings in ARSA and AUSA.”

Air Comet under the SPA.'? Another Spanish company, Viajes Marsans S.A., was named in the
SPA as guarantor of certain of Air Comet’s obligations under the SPA and signed the SPA in that

capacity. !

178. Claimant Teinver became a shareholder of Air Comet on July 20, 2006, when it purchased
Proturin’s and Segetur’s entire shareholdings in Air Comet.'* At this point, Air Comet was owned
entirely by the three Claimants, as follows: Autobuses Urbanos (35%), Transportes de Cercanias

(35%), and Teinver (30%).

179. From July 20, 2006 until the initiation of this arbitration, the three Claimants together
owned 100% of Air Comet, although the distribution of shares during this period changed several
times. On October 2, 2007, Teinver became Air Comet’s majority shareholder, with the following
distribution of shares: Teinver (56%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and Transportes de Cercanias
(22%). Teinver purchased additional shares from Transportes de Cercanias on December 31, 2007,
with the following distribution of shares: Teinver (66.67%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and
Transportes de Cercanias (11.33%). On February 8, 2008, Claimants’ respective participations
shifted substantially: Teinver (96.77%), Autobuses Urbanos (2.13%) and Transportes de Cercanias
(1.1%).!° This was the ownership structure in place at the time Claimants instituted this arbitration
(December 11, 2008) and the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request and
notified the Parties thereof (January 30, 2009).

180. On December 10, 2009, about one year after the initiation of this arbitration, Transportes
de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos sold their remaining shareholdings in Air Comet to Teinver,

leaving Teinver as the sole shareholder of Air Comet.

181. Between 2001 and 2008, when Air Comet owned and controlled the Airlines, each of the

three Claimants Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos was “part of the

as Air Comet’s guarantors (see Cl. Mem. { 40), although Article 8 of the SPA does not expressly indicate this.

184. All three Claimants and Air Comet initiated voluntary insolvency proceedings after this

arbitration was commenced in late 2008.

185. In the case of Air Comet, the Spanish Commercial Court No. 8 issued an order declaring
the initiation of Air Comet’s voluntary reorganization proceeding on April 20, 2010.7! The order
specified that Air Comet’s powers of administration and disposition of its assets were henceforth

subject to the authorization or agreement of the court-appointed reorganization administrators. On

appears that Autobuses Urbanos has not entered the liquidation phase at present, but its powers of

administration and disposition of assets were suspended by court order on April 10, 2013.7?

187. The bankruptcy of Air Comet and of all three Claimants is related to certain factual and
legal disputes in this case. First, Respondent has asserted that Claimants’ bankruptcy terminated
King & Spalding’s power of attorney to represent Claimants in this case. The Parties’ arguments
with respect to this issue are addressed below in Section IV of this Award. Second, the Parties
disagree on the causes of Claimants’ and Air Comet’s bankruptcy. Claimants, through Mr. Diaz
Ferran, assert that the bankruptcies were the direct result of Respondent’s unlawful acts and
policies towards the Airlines.*° Respondent argues that the bankruptcies were due to reasons
wholly unconnected to Respondent’s actions, including Claimants’ poor business management,
lack of liquidity and failure to make payments.*! With respect to Air Comet’s bankruptcy,

Respondent argues that the company was in a state of bankruptcy as early as April 2008, predating

the expropriation of the Airlines later in 2008.*? These arguments with respect to the causation of

Claimants’ insolvencies are relevant to both Claimants’ claims and Respondent’s Counterclaim.

Cc. Evidentiary Issues Related to Claimants

188. Respondent asserts that “the main witnesses produced by Claimants have openly admitted
to having a financial interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceedings, which causes their
testimonies to lose value.”*? Respondent notes, in particular, that Claimants’ witness, Mr. Vicente
Mujioz Pérez, would benefit from the right to receive a percentage from the total amount that
Claimants might collect from any award in this proceeding.*+ During the hearing, Mr. Muiioz

Pérez conceded this interest, asserting that it constitutes remuneration for the work he has done.*®

189. Likewise, Respondent notes that Claimants’ witness, Mr. Ignacio Pascual de Riva,

 

recognized during the hearing that Air Comet owed him one million Euros that he had previously

lent to Air Comet from his personal contributions.*°
190. Finally, Respondent makes the following argument in its Post-Hearing Brief:

have testified th these di so_that this Tribunal cannot hold the Argentine
Republic liable based on the statements of those who are suspected and/or have been convicted of

particularly with respect to the “Operacién Crucero” criminal case.*°

192. It is the Tribunal’s view that neither the domestic criminal and/or civil liability of any
witness in this proceeding, nor the existence of pending criminal or civil suits against any witness
in this proceeding, may constitute a bar on the witness’s ability to testify in this arbitration
proceeding. Likewise, the existence of legal liability or potential legal liability on the part of any
witness in this case may not, on its own, serve as a basis on which to preclude the Argentine
Republic’s liability under the Treaty. The Tribunal must weigh the relevance and the relative
weight of all the evidence produced in this case. The Tribunal has reviewed and addressed each of
Respondent’s assertions with respect to Spanish and Argentine domestic legal proceedings in

Section IV.E, below.

IV. ISSUES OF ADMISSIBILITY AND STANDING NOT ADDRESSED IN THE
DECISION ON JURISDICTION

A. King & Spalding’s Power of Attorney to appear in this dispute
1. The Parties’ Arguments

193. Respondent asserts, as an affirmative defense to this case, that the power of attorney
granted by Claimants to King & Spalding became invalid “after the commencement of the
proceedings as a result of the insolvency of the Claimants”[.]*! According to Respondent, King &
Spalding’s alleged lack of power of attorney “constitutes fraud on the court” and “cannot be made

42

right by any subsequent measure,”** and these proceedings before ICSID must therefore be

closed.

194. In support of its arguments, Respondent points to Article 48(3) of Spain’s Bankruptcy Law,
which provides that “any power of attorney existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency

proceedings shall be affected by the suspension or control of financial and property-related

procedural capacity.”*> Respondent also cites to Spanish Civil Code Article 1732(3) which,
according to Respondent, “expressly sets forth that the declaration of bankruptcy of the principal

is one of the grounds for termination of the power of attorney.”*°

195. For its part, Respondent disagrees with the view by Claimants’ expert witness,
Professor Aurora Martinez Florez, that the relationship between Claimants and King & Spalding

is one of a service contract.‘”

Respondent argues that regardless of how the contract is classified,
the fact remains that King & Spalding’s power of attorney to act before this Tribunal ceased to

exist under Spanish law.**

196. Moreover, Respondent argues that King & Spalding’s attempts to “ratify” its power of

acts taken by King & Spalding and to authorize the firm to carry on its activities.°+ Respondent
asserts that “every lawyer is aware that, in order for a power of attorney to be renewed within the

context of an insolvency proceeding, there must be a court order authorizing such renewal.”*>

197. Finally, Respondent argues that the financing agreement signed between Claimants and
third-party funder Burford on July 14, 2010 required Claimants to use the King & Spalding
attorneys.°° Respondent asserts that it is because of this requirement that Claimants have not
produced a new Power of Attorney between the receivers and King & Spalding as they should

Spanish Bankruptcy Law, the court’s authorization would only be required ‘in order to withdraw,

to accept a claim, in whole or in part, and to settle disputes.”

200. With respect to the power of attorney granted to King & Spalding, Claimants’ expert
witness, Professor Martinez Flérez, asserts that after the suspension of powers, the board of
trustees directly steps into the shoes of the debtor in the agreements and powers of attorney granted
by the debtor before the declaration of bankruptcy.® She states that the trustees may terminate
agreements with the attorneys and hire other representatives it chooses, but that to the extent the
trustees do not do this, “the attorneys-in-fact existing at the time of the suspension will continue

performing the duties entrusted to them to avoid business interruption.”

201. With respect to Article 48(3) of the Bankruptcy Law, which provides that “any power of
attorney existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency proceedings shall be affected by the
suspension or control of financial and property-related powers,” Professor Martinez Florez opines
that the “affected” language does not mean that powers of attorney are terminated.© She explains
that Article 51(2) of the Bankruptcy Law provides that while upon suspension the trustees replace
the debtor in ongoing proceedings, this replacement “does not prevent the debtor from retaining
separate representation and defense through its own attorney and trial attorney.”® She takes the

view, therefore, that if a debtor did in fact retain separate representation and defense, this indicates

that 1) the trustees had cancelled the power of attorney, since if they had not, the debtor’s power
of attorney would combine with that of the trustee, and 2) that such power of attorney held by the

debtor did not terminate upon suspension.”

202. With respect to the undated letters of ratification drafted by the reorganization
administrators, Professor Martinez Flérez asserts that each letter is “an unnecessary document
because the Power of Attorney that the lawyers had is still in full force.”®* According to her, there

is therefore no need to ratify any power of attorney or grant a new power of attorney.

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Application of Spanish law

203. Respondent bases its arguments regarding the validity of the power of attorney granted to
King & Spalding on Spanish law. The Tribunal agrees that, since Claimants are Spanish nationals,
issues related to their capacity, including the validity of powers of attorney granted by those
entities, should be determined based on the domestic law of Spain. Respondent challenges the
validity of King & Spalding’s power of attorney in these proceedings and submits that continuing
to act without a valid power of attorney is, in essence, a formal irregularity that constitutes “fraud”
on this Tribunal. However, Respondent (correctly) does not take the position that this present
arbitration cannot continue simply by virtue of the fact that Claimants entered voluntary insolvency
proceedings after the initiation of the arbitration. Spanish Bankruptcy Law Article 52 is clear on
this subject:

Arbitration proceedings that are pending at the time of the reorganization proceeding declaration

shall continue until the award becomes final, and the rules contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the
70
\dded]

  

 

preceding article shall apply. [empha

204. In turn, Article 51(2), that “preceding article,” applies with respect to companies in a state

of suspension (as each of the Claimants currently is) as follows:

In case of suspension of the debtor’s powers of administration and disposition, the reorganization
administrators shall, within the scope of their powers, replace the debtor in the pending legal
proceedings. To that effect, the law clerk shall grant the reorganization administrators a period of
five days to get i with the i The reorganizati ini shall need the
bankruptcy judge’s authorization to withdraw, to accept the claim, in whole or in part, and to settle
disputes. In every case, the law clerk shall give notice to the debtor and to those intervening parties
that the judge considers should be heard on the subject.”!

205. As applied in this case, Article 51(2) requires that Claimants’ reorganization administrators
replace Claimants themselves in the present proceedings. Article 51(2) also provides that
Claimants’ administrators do not need to seek court authorization to take on or maintain this role;

court authorization is only required if they withdraw or otherwise settle this dispute.

206. The issue for this Tribunal to determine is whether King & Spalding has power of attorney
at the present stage of this arbitration, now that each of Claimants’ administrative powers have
been suspended (in April 2013). Claimants submit that the power of attorney is still valid and that
Claimants’ reorganization administrators are simply “stepping into the shoes” of Claimants for
purposes of the continuation of this arbitration. Respondent argues, to the contrary, that Claimants’
power of attorney was extinguished by the bankruptcy, that a new power of attorney is needed,
and that a valid new power of attorney has not yet been granted to King & Spalding or anyone

else.

207. Respondent argues that there is no possibility to cure this defect, and that this arbitration
must be dismissed.” In its final prayer for relief in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent requests the
Tribunal “to declare that King & Spalding lacks the necessary legal capacity to represent Claimants
in this arbitration, which would result in the annulment of all actions taken, as well as to declare

the forfeiture of Claimants’ right to file an action.”

208. Ordered chronologically, the relevant facts related to this issue placed in the context of the

procedure of the arbitration are as follow:

The administrators or liquidators of the insolvent legal person shall continue to represent it within

existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency proceedings shall be affected by the suspension

210. Respondent says that “‘affected” means that the power of attorney was extinguished or was
terminated by operation of law. As a result, King & Spalding lost their procedural capacity to

represent Claimants.

211. Respondent also points to Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code which, according to
it, provides that the declaration of bankruptcy of the principal is one of the grounds for termination

of a power of attorney. Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code provides as follows:

El mandato se acaba: 1.° Por su revocacién. 2.° Por renuncia 0 incapacitacién del mandatario. 3.°
Por muerte, declaracién de prodigalidad o por concurso o insolvencia del mandante o del
mandatario. / El mandato se extinguira, también, por la incapacitacién sobrevenida del mandante a
no ser que en el mismo se hubiera dispuesto su continuacién o el mandato se hubiera dado para el
caso de incapacidad del mandante apreciada conforme a lo dispuesto por éste. En estos casos, el
mandato podra terminar por resolucién judicial dictada al constituirse el organismo tutelar o
posteriormente a instancia del tutor.

 

212. In addition, Respondent argues that the attempts to ratify or cure the defects in the Power
of Attorney must fail. In this regard, it says that the letters produced by Claimants with their Reply
are defective because they are not in a notarial instrument, which it says is required when the
original power of attorney was granted by way of a notarized public document. Further, it says
that the letters from the re-organization administrators are undated and are not addressed directly
to ICSID or the Tribunal but, rather, to King & Spalding. Finally, Respondent says that the letters
were required to have been authorized or ordered by the court and cannot simply be issued

unilaterally by the trustees under their own authority.

213. The Tribunal finds that Respondent's objections as to the lack of standing due to the
termination or extinguishment of King & Spalding's power of attorney are not persuasive for a

number of reasons.

214. First, it would seem appropriate to rely primarily on the provisions of the Spanish
Bankruptcy Law as lex specialis rather than Article 1732 of the Spanish Civil Code.*? The Spanish
Bankruptcy Law is more closely focused on what occurs with respect to the ongoing conduct of

proceedings when insolvency occurs.

215. In this regard, Article 52(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law provides that arbitration
proceedings underway at the time re-organization proceedings are declared shall continue until the
issuance of the award. It also provides that Articles 51(2) and (3) shall apply. It is worth noting
that the Spanish Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between court/judicial proceedings and arbitral
proceedings, except to the extent that it incorporates certain provisions, such as Article 51(2) and
(3), in the treatment of arbitral proceedings. The latter provide that in the event of suspension of
the debtor's powers of administration and disposal (which comes with the commencement of the
liquidation phase), the insolvency administrators (within the scope of their competency) are
substituted for the debtor. They must appear in the proceedings and then they are accorded time
to become informed of the proceedings to date. In addition, Article 51(2) provides that the
authorization of the judge presiding over the bankruptcy will be required for the insolvency
administrators to withdraw, accept or settle claims. It does not require court authorization for any
other actions taken by the insolvency administrators. In addition, Article 51(2) of the Spanish
Bankruptcy Law provides that the debtor may retain/maintain separate legal representation of his
own provided that the debtor provides sufficient guarantees to the court regarding payment of that

representation and as to costs.

216. Asset out above, King & Spalding's representation of Claimants was implemented by way
of a power of attorney issued by each of the boards of Claimants, as well as a separate Retainer
Agreement (the “Retainer Agreement”). These were submitted with Claimants’ Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Rule 2(2) of the ICSID Rules. There is no dispute that the original
power of attorney and Retainer Agreement were valid and retained their full force and effect until
the commencement of the liquidation phase/suspension of the powers of administration and

disposition of assets of the debtor companies in April 2013. At the Tribunal's request, each of the

Award

sets of re-organization administrators confirmed the validity and effect of the original power of
attorney and Retainer Agreement in June 2011. Further, after the commencement of the
liquidation proceedings/suspension of Claimants’ powers of administration and disposition of
assets occurred in April 2013, each of the sets of re-organization administrators wrote to the
Tribunal to confirm their appearance in the arbitral proceedings and to ratify and approve the

actions taken by King & Spalding on behalf of Claimants.

217. While Respondent raises formal objections relating to the letters from the re-organization
administrators, for the reasons discussed below these are not convincing. Each of these sets of
administrators were appointed by the court in charge of the insolvency proceedings, were fully
aware of the history of the arbitration, including the Funding Agreement (and the Assignment
Agreement) and have twice confirmed their agreement with the continuation of the arbitration and
representation by King & Spalding. The Spanish Bankruptcy Law does not require any particular
form in which the re-organization administrators must appear in arbitral proceedings or ratify the
conduct of the proceedings. The only specific instances in which court authorization is required

are for the withdrawal, acceptance or settlement of claims against the debtor.

218. Pursuant to the Spanish Bankruptcy Law, it appears that the re-organization administrators
step into the shoes of the debtor upon the commencement of liquidation proceedings/suspension
of powers of administration and disposition of assets. In this regard, except where specifically
provided for by the Spanish Bankruptcy Law (i.e., withdrawal, acceptance or settlement of claims
against the debtor), it does not appear that any special court authorization is required for the re-
organization administrators to perform their task. Article 61(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law
provides that bilateral contracts to which the debtor is a party remain in effect despite the
commencement of re-organization proceedings and their validity is not affected. Further, Article
61(2) provides that the debtor (in the case of intervention) or the re-organization administrators (in
the case of suspension) may request from the court the termination of a contract if this is deemed
in the interests of the insolvency proceedings. If such a request is made, the court must hear the
parties before deciding whether the contract shall be terminated. In this case, the re-organization
administrators have not requested the termination of the Retainer Agreement between Claimants
and King & Spalding. In fact, the opposite has occurred and each set of re-organization

53

v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1)

 

Award

administrators have reaffirmed King & Spalding's powers of representation and ratified the actions

taken by that firm on behalf of Claimants.

219. Further, the Tribunal is persuaded by Professor Martinez Fl6érez’s opinion that
Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code does not apply to contracts like the Representation
Agreement.” It would seem that the "Contract of Representation" between Claimants and King
& Spalding is a bilateral service agreement and is different from the power of attorney, which was

granted separately.

220. With respect to the powers of attorney granted by Claimants to King & Spalding,
Article 48(3) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law states that such powers in existence at the time of
the declaration of re-organization/insolvency proceedings shall be "afectados" (affected) by the
suspension or intervention of the powers of the debtor. The article does not say that the powers of
attorney shall be terminated or extinguished. Elsewhere, in Article 61(2), the Spanish Bankruptcy
Law refers to the termination (resolucidn) of contracts (and also states that the declaration of
insolvency proceedings, in itself, shall not affect the validity of contracts). Article 1732 of the
Spanish Civil Code provides that agency agreements shall terminate as a result of death, insolvency
or re-organization proceedings of the agent. It also states that the agency agreement shall be
"extinguished" in certain circumstances. By contrast, Article 48(3) of the Spanish Bankruptcy
Law states only that powers of attorney shall be "affected" by intervention or suspension. With
the commencement of insolvency proceedings, whether by way of the voluntary or obligatory
proceedings, the powers of attorney are affected in that (in the case of intervention) the actions of
the debtor through its counsel/authorized representative are subject to the approval of the re-
organization administrators. In the case of suspension, all actions within the scope of authority of
the re-organization administrators are undertaken by them (and not the debtor itself) on behalf of
the debtor. In this respect, it seems reasonable that the power of attorney is affected or limited by
the exercise of the relevant powers of the re-organization administrators. However, the power of

attorney is not terminated or extinguished by the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

Further, the separate Contract of Representation remains in force, unless terminated by the debtor

or the re-organization administrators.

221. Inthe Tribunal’s view, Respondent’s objections to the ratification of the representation of
Claimants by King & Spalding are highly formal and somewhat arbitrary. The three different sets
of re-organization administrators have been appointed by the court and are all active in the courts’
various public proceedings. In their letters, presented with Claimants’ Reply in August 2013, the
various sets of re-organization administrators state that they ratify all of the actions performed by
Claimants in the course of the arbitration, both from its institution and after the commencement of
the liquidation proceedings/suspension in April 2013 in the bankruptcy re-organization

proceedings before the court.?!

As they have been appointed by the court and regularly appeared
before it, it is reasonable to assume that they are not likely to engage in unauthorized action,
particularly with respect to the pursuance of this arbitration, which is known to the court. Further,
Mr. Arqued approved the Assignment Agreement by way of the agreement between Air Comet
and its re-organization trustees”? and requested and obtained the approval of the court (IMM No.
8) of the Funding Agreement. Mr. Arqued is also a re-organization trustee in the Teinver
proceedings. Further, there does not appear to have been any objection by ARSA in the various

re-organization proceedings - to which it is a party®? - that the re-organization administrators are

pursuing the arbitration without authorization due to invalid powers of attorney.

222. Finally, in the circumstances of an international arbitration which has been ongoing for a
number of years, one must question whether the strict application of the formalities of granting
powers of attorney at Spanish law appropriately apply. The arbitration was, by all accounts,
commenced on behalf of Claimants by properly authorized legal representatives. Almost five
years after the commencement of the arbitration, due to the commencement of liquidation
proceedings/suspension of powers of administration/disposition of assets, Respondent raises the

validity of counsel's power of attorney and authorization to represent Claimants. In response, the

re-organization administrators wrote to the Tribunal to confirm that they ratify the actions taken
by counsel for Claimants and confirm their authorization to proceed with the arbitration. Although
the letters are undated and not notarized or specifically ordered to be produced by the Spanish
court, it would not seem appropriate to disregard these unless there is a valid reason to suspect that
they are part of an effort to improperly create standing for the continuation of the claim. There is
no evidence supporting this conclusion. Further, it should be noted that Mr. Arqued, a re-
organization administrator in both the Air Comet and the Teinver insolvency proceedings, attended
the hearing for some time, as did Mr. Hernandez, another re-organization administrator in the Air

Comet proceedings.

223. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the powers of attorney granted to King
& Spalding were initially, and have continued throughout these proceedings to be, valid.
Claimants have proved that there was no obligation at Spanish law to produce a new power of
attorney in the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal also notes that, as a factual matter, it is
satisfied that the re-organization administrators of each Claimant and the relevant Spanish courts
are aware of the powers of attorney and, further, have ratified the actions taken by the attorney in
this arbitration. Consequently, the Tribunal declines Respondent’s request to find that King &
Spalding’s (alleged) lack of power of attorney “constitutes fraud on the court” and dismisses
Respondent’s request that these proceedings before ICSID be closed on the basis that the powers

of attorney were invalid.

The Relevance of the Burford Funding Agreement

224. At the merits hearing, Respondent advanced an additional argument concerning King &
Spalding’s power of attorney. Specifically, Respondent argued that the Burford Funding
Agreement requires Claimants to use King & Spalding as their counsel, and that a “conspiracy”
between Claimants and Burford explains why they did not seek a proper new power of attorney.
Specifically, Respondent argues that Clause 6(3) of the Funding Agreement entitles Burford to
terminate the funding agreement if King & Spalding’s power of attorney is modified or terminated,

as well as to receive substantial compensation under Clause 10.1 of the Agreement.

225. The “Funding Agreement” is an April 14, 2010 funding agreement made between
Claimants and Burford,** an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, which concerned
the financing of Claimants’ litigation expenses in this arbitration. Respondent argued during the
jurisdictional phase of this proceeding—and continues to argue—that Burford is a “vulture fund”

that will be the primary beneficiary of any ICSID award in this case.”
226. Clause 6.3 of the Funding Agreement provides:

The Claimant undertakes to grant to the Nominated Lawyers a full power of attorney (or local law
equivalent) in the Funder’s usual form to cause and allow any and all Award proceeds to be paid
forthwith as set out above. The Parties acknowledge and agree that such power of attorney (or local
law equivalent) is of the essence of this Agreement and is a condition thereof and that any variation
or termination of such power of attorney shall entitle the Funder to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Clause 10.1.%

227. As such, Clause 6.3 concerns a specific “power of attorney” to disburse payments from the
Award. Schedule 3, Definitions of the Funding Agreement, in turn defines “Nominated Lawyers”
as “the lawyers conducting the Claim on behalf of the Claimant being specified as such in Schedule

1 or a substitute firm selected by the Claimant with the Funder’s approval (which shall not be

unreasonably withheld).”°”

228. In this regard, Respondent submitted as follows:

If the full powers of attorney granted to K&S in the year 2008 were affected by a declaration of
bankruptcy against their clients, then the effectiveness of the Funding Agreement would come to an
end and, therefore, the whole scheme would fall apart, because if K&S were granted a new power
of attorney, this time by the trustees in insolvency, such power of attorney would force K&S to
report to the trustees of insolvency and the respective groups of creditors in the insolvency
proceedings resulting in a declaration of bankruptcy and, as a result, the private and confidential
Funding Agreement would cease to have legal effect.

4 RA-160.

°5 Respondent asserts that Burford “is not an investor under the BIT, but rather a third party that is abusing the ICSID
system by bringing forward a claim that is contrary to the purposes and goals of the Convention in order to make
astronomical profits.” (Resp. CM { 89) Respondent also argues that the order of priority for beneficiaries of any award
in this proceeding will be Castle 2003-1C (an American company with a court-ordered lien to collect on any award in
this proceeding) (Resp. CM {ff 92-94), Burford, a number of private individuals (see Resp. CM [ 95), Air Comet, and
finally Air Comet’s creditors. Respondent argues that in light of the distribution of any potential award, “[hJardly
could the case be more removed from the aim and goals of the ICSID Convention.” (Resp. CM 96)

229. Respondent says that a "conspiracy" between Claimants and Burford explains why

Claimants did not seek to obtain a new, proper power of attorney.°®

230. The Tribunal has found that the powers of attorney are valid and that there was no
obligation to seek a new power of attorney. In light of this finding, it is not necessary to make
findings in respect of Respondent’s “conspiracy” argument relating to the powers of attorney. The
Tribunal considers it important to note that Respondent provided no evidence to support this
argument, which makes serious allegations not only about Claimants, but also their counsel and
third-party funders. Respondent entirely failed to substantiate its “conspiracy” argument and it is

inconsistent with the evidence.

231. First, regarding the notion of conspiracy, although the Funding Agreement was originally
a private agreement between Claimants and Burford, it was disclosed to the re-organization
administrators for Air Comet who agreed with the Funding Agreement and requested its approval

t,° which approved the Funding Agreement.'°° By way of its court approval, the

by the court
Funding Agreement became public and must have been known by the re-organization
administrators for Claimants (Mr. Arqued was a re-organization administrator for both Air Comet
and for Teinver). In view of the close inter-relationship between the Air Comet insolvency
proceedings and those of Claimants and the Assignment Agreement, it is reasonable to assume
that the re-organization administrators for each of Claimants were fully aware of the Funding

Agreement.

232. Second, with respect to the argument that the Funding Agreement requires Claimants to
retain King & Spalding as attorneys, and the fact that insolvency proceedings are a ground for
termination of the Funding Agreement pursuant to Article 10.3, this argument makes little sense.
Respondent's argument appears to be that if Claimants had requested a new power of attorney this
would have alerted Burford to the insolvency proceedings and given the latter the right to terminate

the Funding Agreement. However, it is highly unlikely that Burford was not already fully aware

of Claimants’ financial status and continued to monitor it closely, given its financial interest in
doing so. In any event, there is no indication that Burford ever treated the insolvency of Claimants
as a basis for terminating the Funding Agreement (it appears that their financial interests are well
protected in that agreement). Further, the relevance of the relationship between Claimants and
Burford as far as a potential termination of the Funding Agreement is concerned is unclear. The
re-organization administrators were, and are, clearly aware of the Funding Agreement and have
confirmed King & Spalding's authorization to represent Claimants in this arbitration because, it is

logical to assume, this is in the interests of Claimants’ creditors.

233. Accordingly, the Tribunal would not vary its finding on the validity of the powers of

attorney based on Respondent’s additional “conspiracy” argument.

B. Claimants’ Alleged Lack of Standing

234. Respondent additionally argues that Claimants do not have standing in this arbitration

because they assigned their litigation rights to Air Comet.'°!

235. The Assignment Agreement among Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses
Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee, was executed on January 18, 2010.' The
Agreement concerned the assignment to Air Comet of the proceeds of a potential award in this
arbitration, and was addressed in some detail by this Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction in 2012.
In that Decision, the Tribunal determined that the Assignment Agreement post-dated the filing of
the arbitration, and did not affect Claimants’ standing to bring this arbitration.'!° The Tribunal
noted that its conclusions were “without prejudice to further submissions by the Parties in respect
of Respondent’s allegations in so far as they affect the merits of Claimants’ claims, as appropriate,

during the merits stage.” !°*

Transportes de Cercanias S.A., since it was made at a date that is curiously close to the date Air
Comet S.A.U. initiated its insolvency proceedings[.]”!°> Respondent also asserts that the
assignment is “a confession of the fact that the filing of this claim before the ICSID Tribunal by
the three shareholder companies—in the full knowledge that the claim, if any, belonged to Air
Comet—was a guise and that the only reason why they devised all of this scheme was to facilitate
the distribution of the slices that the various parties and participants will receive if the tribunal

tules in favor of Claimants.” !°°

237. Respondent also argues that the agreement is an assignment of contentious claims from
Claimants to Air Comet, and not simply of the rights to the proceeds from any potential award.!°7
Respondent argues that “once the assignment is made, the assignor is replaced in the proceedings
by the assignee, which has not been the case in this arbitration proceeding.”!°* In other words,
Respondent argues, Air Comet should have appeared in this proceeding. Moreover, Respondent
argues that Argentina as the potential debtor should have been given prior notice of the assignment

of its debt. !°

238. For their part, Claimants argue that the Assignment Agreement did not transfer Claimants’
rights under the Treaty, but rather transferred to Air Comet only the right to net proceeds from
Argentina’s payment of a potential award of damages.'!® Claimants assert that there is no
applicable legal standard that would prevent this Tribunal from issuing an award of damages in
Claimants’ favor due to the assignment agreement.''' Claimants argue moreover that the
assignment to Air Comet is a perfectly valid transaction, and that at the time of the assignment

neither Claimants nor Air Comet were undergoing any type of reorganization proceedings under

112

Spanish law.'’~ Finally, Claimants note that Air Comet is not entitled to seek payment directly

239. The terms of the assignment agreement provide as follows:

1) Assignors hereby expressly agree to assign to AIR COMET S.A.U. any and all collection rights
that may arise out of the claim filed with the ICSID ...

2) Parties hereto agree that the final amount to be assigned to AIR COMET S.A.U. shall be equal
to the amount the ICSID may possibly award to the Assignors after deducting all necessary and
relevant costs, as well as any and all payments due to the ICSID Tribunal. All fees and expenses
related to legal advisers, consultants, expert witnesses, witnesses, experts, reports, assessments, as
well the interests or commissions due to any and all institutions, companies or offices contributing
to the funding of the claim shall also be deducted from the amount to be assigned. Finally, in order
to fix the final amount of the collection rights to be assigned to AIR COMET S.A.U., success fees
agreed upon in contract in favor of those intervening during the proceedings before the ICSID
Tribunal shall be deducted as well, whether they are due for tasks performed prior to the filing of
the formal claim, during the relevant proceedings, or during any appeal or during the enforcement
thereof, !!4

 

 

240. The text of the agreement does not appear to assign Claimants’ contentious claims in this
dispute; rather, the text appears to be limited to assigning to Air Comet the proceeds from any
award issued. Furthermore, the agreement contemplates that Air Comet would receive the award
proceeds only after Claimants have paid the costs and fees described in item 2. As such, it does
not appear that Air Comet has the right to receive payment directly from Argentina in the event of

the award.

241. It should also be noted that the Assignment Agreement, which was signed on January 18,
2010, predated by three months the initiation of Air Comet’s voluntary reorganization proceeding
on April 20, 2010.''5 It also predated the initiation of the three Claimants’ voluntary
reorganization proceedings by about a year. Air Comet and its insolvency administrators executed

dispute and the Assignment Agreement.''® The Assignment Agreement was filed with the Spanish

court overseeing Air Comet’s reorganization.

242. The Tribunal finds that Claimants did not assign their claims through the Assignment
Agreement and, accordingly, that agreement can have no impact on the standing of Claimants in

this proceeding.

Cc. Other Issues of Admissibility

243. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal left open certain additional issues of
admissibility that were not necessary to address at that stage of the proceedings, as it had
determined that the claims were admissible and that Claimants had standing, and that required
further factual inquiries in order to be properly determined. At this stage, the Tribunal will return
to the issues of Respondent’s objections, on policy grounds, to Claimants’ standing because it
would allegedly upset the hierarchy of claims against the Airlines. The Tribunal will also address
the question of whether, in addition to their respective indirect shareholdings in Interinvest,

Claimants made other investments in Argentina that are protected by the Treaty.

244. Respondent notes in its Post-Hearing Brief that this Tribunal “postponed the analysis of
certain irregularities regarding the admissibility of the submission and claims filed by Claimants
for final consideration at the time of rendering the award on the merits of the case.”!!” Respondent
cites to paragraph 234 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, in which the Tribunal addressed certain
arguments made by Respondent with respect to the indirect nature of Claimants’ shareholding in
the Airlines, which were held by Claimants through two layers of subsidiaries, the Spanish Air

Comet and the Argentine holding company, Interinvest.

245. As the Tribunal noted,

 

... Respondent has advanced a number of policy arguments against Claimants’ standing in this
dispute. According to Respondent, the Claimants are upsetting the hierarchy of creditor claims
against the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest, and it is inappropriate to award damages to a
shareholder rather than to the company that has actually suffered injury. Respondent also expresses
its concern that this suit could increase the risk that Respondent could be subjected to double-

payment, because Interinvest could recover through the Argentine Courts in addition to any recovery
by the Claimants under the Treaty. |!

246. The Tribunal then determined that

Respondent's assertions could have relevance in the merits proceeding of this case, but Respondent

fails to demonstrate why these assertions are relevant at the jurisdictional stage. Moreover,

Respondent has failed to articulate why these policy issues, as specifically applied to the facts at

hand, should affect the outcome of this jurisdictional objection. Respondent has not attempted to

demonstrate the extenuating nature of the facts here, or to differentiate the facts in this case from

the large number of other ICSID cases in which claimant shareholders were found to have

standing.
247. With respect to Respondent’s allegation, during the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding,
that Claimants’ recovery would upset the hierarchy of creditor claims against the Airlines and/or
Interinvest, Respondent has not placed any evidence on the record in either the jurisdictional or
the merits phase to support this contention. Indeed, it is not clear that there is, in fact, any “list”
of creditor claims against the Airlines, which are not currently in insolvency, or against Interinvest
(the current status of which has not been addressed over the course of these proceedings). '?° To
be sure, Respondent has addressed the “hierarchy” of beneficiaries with respect to any proceeds
from this Tribunal’s award. However, that is a different issue than the one raised during the

jurisdictional phase of this arbitration in connection with Claimants’ “indirect” interest in the

Airlines.

248. For this reason, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence to support Respondent’s

position that Claimants’ standing is affected by policy reasons related to the hierarchy of creditors.

249. With respect to the question of whether Claimants had other investments in Argentina, at
paragraphs 207 through 238 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that Claimants'

indirect shareholdings constitute an investment and that Claimants have standing to bring their

118 Decision on Jurisdiction J 233.

119 Decision on Jurisdiction J 234.

!20 The Tribunal notes that the Argentine Federal Administrative Court ruled in favour of the Argentine Republic with
respect to the expropriation of Interinvest’s shares in the Airlines on February 27, 2014 and the Interinvest’s appeal
appears to have been dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Contentious - Administrative Matters. See {| 468-

claims. The Tribunal's finding of jurisdiction on the basis of the ownership of shares is sufficient

to found jurisdiction and is a final decision.

250. At paragraph 238 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal deferred consideration of
Claimants' other investments to the merits stage of the proceedings. Now that the evidentiary part
of that stage of the proceedings is complete, the Tribunal concludes that, in addition to shares in

Interinvest, certain other investments identified by Claimants were also made.

251. Through their wholly-owned subsidiary, Air Comet, Claimants entered into the SPA by
which they acquired the shareholdings in Interinvest, ARSA and AUSA and also undertook a
number of other commitments which required the investment of funds for the benefit of Interinvest
and the Airlines. Two of the three Claimants were shareholders of Air Comet and signatories to
the SPA (Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos) and the third (Teinver) purchased all
the remaining shares of Air Comet in 2006. As shareholders and signatories, Transportes de
Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos approved the SPA and unconditionally assumed all of Air
Comet's obligations under the SPA and, in particular, the several terms of the Industrial Plan set

out in Article 7 of the SPA.

252. While the nominal purchase price under the SPA was USD 1.00, this was a much more
complex agreement pursuant to which Air Comet (and Claimants) undertook several obligations,

including the following:

. Assumption of the assets and liabilities of ARSA and AUSA (including
responsibility for all liabilities going forward from the relevant financial statements

for ARSA May 31, 2001 and for AUSA fiscal year 2000);

. Leading the negotiation of the Creditors Agreement/re-organization proceedings of

ARSA and negotiations with the creditors of AUSA;

. Commitment to maintaining the headcount of the various airlines and companies;

. Maintenance and expansion of flight routes and of the fleet of the airlines; and

Award
. Contribution of capital.

253. The SPA and the other agreements related to it represent a complex transaction.'*!_ The
nominal purchase price does not reflect the complexity of the transaction. A nominal purchase
price is not unusual where there are other interests and risks associated with the transaction. In

this regard, see, for example, Société Générale v The Dominican Republic!”

and Bayindir v.
Pakistan where the funds invested in the construction project were the funds paid by the State
under the relevant contract. Here, it is clear that Air Comet and its shareholders, Claimants, were
undertaking significant responsibilities and risks in assuming the debts and liabilities of the

Airlines going forward and the undertaking to maintain and expand the operations of the Airlines.

254. Further, pursuant to the obligations under the SPA, SEPI transferred funds to Interinvest
and Air Comet in Argentina and Spain. In turn, these funds were invested in the Airlines. While
the origin of the funds in question was SEPI and not Claimants, this is irrelevant, as the funds were
contributed as a result of the obligations undertaken by Air Comet and Claimants under the SPA.
This is consistent with other cases where tribunals have found that the actual source of the funds
is irrelevant provided that these were contributed by the investor.'** While there may be some
dispute as to the precise amounts contributed, there seems no doubt that a number of sums were

contributed to Interinvest and the Airlines by Air Comet:

255. In addition, through Air Comet and Interinvest, Claimants invested in the concessions to
operate the Airlines. The evidence indicates that Claimants clearly contributed to the improvement
of the Airlines’ fleets through leasing contracts and the Airbus orders and a USD 5 million Boeing

737 flight simulator.

256. Finally, Claimants also provided technical, logistical and marketing support. The evidence
indicates that after the execution of the SPA and takeover by Air Comet and Claimants, the
performance of the Airlines improved dramatically (until 2004/2005, when cost increases

accelerated sharply and other events affected the Airlines’ performance).

257. The Tribunal notes that Respondent does not seriously challenge that these additional
investments were made or that Claimants operated the Airlines. Instead, Respondent’s arguments
focus on their dissatisfaction with how these investments were managed by Claimants. These
arguments will be discussed in the context of the analysis of the merits, beginning in the following

the Tribunal considers it convenient to address these arguments at this

1. Claimants’ Investment in the Airlines

History of the Airlines, the 2001 Auction of Interinvest and the Share Purchase Agreement

259. The precursor companies to ARSA had been owned by the Argentine state since the 1950s.
They were privatized and purchased by a group of investors led by Spanish state-owned airline
Iberia Lineas Aéreas de Espajia S.A. (“Iberia”) in 1990. The precursor companies to AUSA were
acquired by Iberia in 1991. Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest
S.A., in 1994 to serve as the holding company for the Spanish investments in the Argentine airline
industry. In 1995, the Spanish government constituted SEPI to operate as the holding company for
all companies owned partially or fully by the Spanish Government, and SEPI acquired Iberia’s

holdings in Interinvest.'°?

260. By mid-2001, the Airlines were facing severe financial and operational difficulties. At the
time, only 10% of international flights and 30% of domestic flight routes were being operated;
there were delays in paying employee salaries; and there were significant labor conflicts.'> ARSA
filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 2001. That same month, SEPI announced its intention
to sell its share of Interinvest in order to end contributions of Spanish public capital into the
Airlines, which had been necessary over the previous decade.'** The Argentine Government

followed the sale process closely, although it was not interested in aiding ARSA through any

allocation of government funds.'*>

132 See Cl. Mem. if 20-26.

133 C_9: SEPI Summary Report.

'4 See SEPI Summary Report: C-9, which states that one of the advantages of selling SEPI’s shares was that SEPI
could successfully put an end to contributions of Spanish public capital which had been necessary over ten years to
sustain the Airlines, and which totalled more than USD 1,817 million of which USD 1,120 million corresponded to
the period 1990-1996 and USD 697.5 million to the period 1996-2001. The SEPI Summary Report also noted that
the Airlines had a loss of USD 363 million in the previous year and USD 43 million per month in 2001.

261. SEPIreceived nine offers from potential buyers, and ultimately selected Air Comet’s offer.
At the time, after assessing all of the offers, SEPI determined that Air Comet’s offer had several
advantages over other offers.!*° In particular, SEPI noted that a sale to Air Comet would permit
SEPI to address the principal problems currently before the companies, including the re-
establishment of routes, punctual payment of salaries and maintenance of the workforce and
updating the outdated and limited fleet. Air Comet’s offer included financial guarantees from
members of the Marsans Group, a superior business plan, and “valuable synergies” from the
Marsans Group network of air transport and tourism.!*” It is not disputed that at the time SEPI sold
its share of Interinvest to Air Comet, the Airlines were in dire financial condition and required

significant investment in terms of both capital and operational commitment.

262. The SPA was signed on October 2, 2001 between Air Comet and SEPI.'38 Air Comet
acquired SEPI’s 99.2% share in Interinvest, and Interinvest in turn held 92.1% of ARSA and 90%
of AUSA. Air Comet paid a symbolic price of USD 1 and undertook the following commitments:
1) to assume Interinvest’s, ARSA’s and AUSA’s liabilities, and to lead the negotiation of the
reorganization for ARSA, 2) retain the Airlines’ personnel for two years, 3) maintain a majority
interest in the Airlines for two years, 4) restart flights on existing routes and develop new routes,
5) make USD 50 million capital contribution, and 6) modernize and expand the Airlines’ fleet.!*°
It is not disputed that Air Comet assumed the Airlines’ liabilities and led the reorganization for
ARSA; retained personnel for two years; maintained a majority interest in the Airlines beyond two
years; and restarted flights on existing routes and developed new routes. Air Comet’s fulfillment
of the obligations to make capital contributions and modernize and expand the Airlines’ fleet will

264. Moreover, Respondent argues that Claimants did not comply with the terms of the SPA, to
the detriment of the Airlines as well as of the Government of Argentina’s own shareholding in the
Airlines.'* In particular, Respondent argues that Air Comet diverted the funds it received from
SEPI from their intended purposes under the SPA, and asserts that Claimants’ goal “was not the

efficient management of the Airlines, but to appropriate [t]he sum of USD 753 million that SEPI

had given them.”!#?

265. The SPA contemplates that SEPI would make three sets of payments to Air Comet to be

used for the following purposes:

To pay off liabilities of the Airlines up to USD 300 million, in accordance with a list of liabilities
to be determined by SEPI. (SPA Article 9)

To pay for economic commitments resulting from the execution or implementation of the Industrial
Plan, in an amount of up to USD 248 million. (SPA Article 9)

To pay for “any deviations in the [Airlines’] assets and liabilities between July 31, 2001 and the
closing.” (SPA Article 11) The amount to be paid by SEPI was not specified at the time of the SPA,
although Respondent puts the final amount at USD 205 million. “4

266. The SPA also contemplates that Air Comet would make a financial contribution of its own,

in the amount of USD 50 million, to be paid within nine months of the closing of the SPA.!4°

267. It is worth first considering the general relevance of these commitments and their alleged
breach to this arbitration. The Tribunal determined in its Decision on Jurisdiction that to the extent
any of the alleged breaches of the SPA did occur, they could not affect jurisdiction because they
would have only occurred subsequent to Claimants’ acquisition of the investment.'4° For the
avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal considers that any acts or contributions made by Air Comet to
the Airlines are acts or contributions made by Claimants. This follows from the fact that Claimants
have demonstrated that they have collectively maintained majority ownership of Air Comet from
the time that the Airlines were purchased from SEPI through to the commencement of the
arbitration, albeit in varying proportions.'4” The Tribunal notes that this is consistent with the
approach taken by Respondent in its submissions and throughout the proceedings of referring to

Claimants as part of the Marsans Group.

268. With respect to the relevance of these alleged breaches on the merits, Respondent now
argues that the diversion of the funds from SEPI “translates into clear and obvious breaches of
both domestic and international law.” “8 Specifically, Respondent asserts that the Marsans Group’s
conduct was contrary to the principle of good faith that is part of Argentine, Spanish and
international law.'*? Respondent also argues that the alleged diversion of funds “marks the
beginning of a pattern that the Group would follow regarding the Airlines through its management”
and that consists of “absorb[ing] as much liquidity as possible, both from SEPI’s funds and from

the Airlines’ administration[.]”!*°

269. In response, Claimants assert that Air Comet complied with the terms of the SPA.
Claimants request that the Tribunal dismiss Argentina’s arguments that Claimants did not invest
in the Airlines and that Claimants’ investment was inadequate or unlawful. Claimants further

request the Tribunal to find that Argentina’s false allegations are irrelevant to either a finding of

liability or the determination of quantum in this arbitration. !>! Each of these individual allegations,

as they relate to admissibility and standing, will be discussed in the following sections.

SEPI’s Payment of USD 300 million for the Cancellation of Debts

270. Respondent’s allegations regarding Claimants’ misuse of the SEPI funds focuses most
intensely on the use of the USD 300 million SEPI provided to cancel ARSA’s debts. The Parties
largely agree that Air Comet used the majority of these designated funds to buy or subrogate
ARSA’s existing debts from its current debt holders.'** ARSA’s liabilities were then transferred
from Air Comet to Interinvest, which turned them into capital contributions that accordingly

increased Interinvest’s stockholdings in ARSA.!*?

271. Respondent argues that these actions violated the terms of the SPA, Article 8, which
earmarked those funds for paying off the Airlines’ liabilities.'** According to Respondent, the
subrogation benefited Air Comet to the detriment of both ARSA and the Government of Argentina,

which held shares in ARSA.

272. With respect to ARSA, Respondent argues that “it is reasonable to suppose that the
financial evolution (and other aspects) of the Airlines would have been different if the funds in
question contributed by SEPI had been applied to the cancellation of debts, as stated in the Share
Purchase Agreement. However, through the Marsans Group’s manoeuvre [sic], after the funds
have been contributed by SEPI, the Airlines still owed said debts, but to a new creditor: by chance,
the Marsans Group (which in turn acquired the claims without paying anything, due to the

diversion of SEPI’s funds).”!>°

converted them into an increased shareholding. See Resp. CM { 232 (“Due to the diversion of funds, Air Comet

273. With respect to the Government of Argentina’s own shares in ARSA, Respondent argues
that since said claims were ultimately contributed to ARSA’s capital, Air Comet obtained the
additional benefit of holding a higher proportional interest in ARSA’s capital, with the other
shareholders’ interests being reduced accordingly. !° Respondent asserts the Argentine Republic’s
interest was reduced from 5.34% to 1.34% by this measure.!°’ Respondent notes that since the
government retained less than 2% of the share capital required by the Argentine Corporations Law
No. 19,550 to request information and to have reports filed with the Audit Committee investigated,
it was reduced to the role of “a passive shareholder at the mercy of the Marsans Group’s

shareholders.” !°8

274. Claimants concede that Air Comet subrogated ARSA’s creditors’ claims rather than paying
off the debt directly. In their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, they described precisely how these

transactions were structured, based on the SPA and two subsequent agreements dated October 15,

2001 '5° and December 3, 2001:!©

These agreements provided as follows: (i) Air Comet would acquire credits against ARSA directly
from ARSA’s creditors; (ii) Air Comet would lead the renegotiation with ARSA’s creditors and
reorganization proceeding; (iii) Air Comet would subrogate in ARSA’s creditors’ rights to facilitate
ARSA’s negotiation with its creditors in the reorganization proceedings, and (iv) Air Comet would
then transfer those credits to Interinvest, which would make a capital increase in ARSA, and

consequently, increase Interinvest’s stockholdings in that airline. !°!

275. Claimants submit that Air Comet’s subrogation to ARSA’s creditors’ rights was done with
SEPI’s consent. ARSA’s liabilities were ultimately transferred to Interinvest and contributed to
ARSA’s capital, thereby increasing Interinvest’s stockholdings and reducing ARSA’s debt.'®
Claimants assert that “[t]his subrogation was done in accordance with the SPA, Spanish and
Argentine law, and with the approval of SEPI, and it is specifically provided for in the December

2001 Agreement” concluded subsequent to the SPA.'® While Claimants concede that the

Argentine Republic’s shareholdings in ARSA decreased, Claimants argue that the alleged
“dilution” was not detrimental to ARSA itself, and that Respondent was presented with the

opportunity to match Interinvest’s capital contribution, but opted not to do so.'*

276. Moreover, Claimants point to their success in settling ARSA’s liabilities, noting that they
were able to reach a Settlement Agreement with ARSA’s creditors that was later approved by the
Argentine bankruptcy court. They note that only three years after their acquisition of the Airlines,

97 percent of ARSA’s Settlement Agreement had already been paid.!°

277. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the evidence and concludes that, despite Respondent’ s
allegations, Air Comet’s use of the USD 300 million did not violate any of its agreements, nor did

Respondent prove that it violated any laws.

278. Pursuant to Article 9 of the SPA, SEPI assumed responsibility for debts and liabilities pre-
July 2001. To meet that obligation, in part, SEPI undertook to transfer USD 300 million, which
were to be allocated to the payment of the liabilities/debts of Interinvest or the Airlines. The
money was to be transferred at closing (formalizacion) pursuant to certain instructions and
priorities set out in Article 9. The article also says that the parties will agree to the procedure for

delivery of the funds prior to closing. !°

279. Interinvest and SEPI entered into a subsequent agreement,'®’ in which Interinvest stated
that it had the intention of purchasing outstanding credits owed by it, ARSA and AUSA to a list
of creditors listed in its Annex A. It goes on to state that in order to do so, Interinvest has requested
from SEPI the contribution of funds. In turn, SEPI states that it intends to contribute the funds
subject to their return if the acquisition of the debts does not proceed. The agreement then goes
on to record that SEPI gives to Interinvest USD 300 million for the purpose of purchasing debts
owed by Interinvest and the Airlines in the amount of USD 319.51 million. The creditors listed

from whom the debts were to be purchased included ABN Bank, SEPI itself, and Repsol. The

agreement is signed by both parties and the copy in evidence bears a stamp showing it has been

produced from a central archive.

280. The evidentiary record also contains a further agreement relating to the acquisition of
certain debts of ARSA, specifically debts owed to ABN Bank, SEPI, Indra and Repsol. This
agreement dated December 3, 2001 is between Air Comet and Transportes de Cercanias, Busursa
(Autobuses), Segetur and Viajes Marsans (the “December 3, 2001 Agreement”).!°* This
agreement records that Air Comet is obliged to use the credits/debts purchased as its own funds in
order to contribute irrevocably as capital or contributions to ARSA in the manner which is most
fiscally convenient to it. This obligation was to be realized within six months of the approval of
the agreement of the creditors to ARSA’s re-organization proceedings (Point II). In the event the
credits purchased were not used as agreed, the signatories to the contract conferred to SEPI the
irrevocable right to demand from any of them payment of the amounts at issue (approximately

USD 300 million) (Point III).

281. Point IV of that agreement records that Air Comet, as the shareholder of Interinvest, which
was the controlling shareholder of ARSA, was obliged to send to SEPI a copy of the certificates
issued by the auditors of ARSA recording the destination of the credits purchased by Air Comet
(pursuant to Point II). The parties also declared that a copy of the contract would be notified
formally by a notary to SEPI for its knowledge, approval and acceptance of the rights accorded to
it under the contract. It appears that on the same date, December 3, 2001, this contract was
“elevated” to public status before a notary who also confirmed that he had been requested to
officially notify a copy to SEPI. The notary goes on to state that a copy was notified to SEPI. The
record indicates that on December 5, 2001, another notary attended at the offices of SEPI and met
with the Secretary General of that company who declared before the notary that he was familiar
with the contract being “elevated” to public status and that he accepted expressly the rights
conferred upon SEPI in the contract and that he reviewed the documents and approved and signed

them. Thus, the Tribunal notes that although SEPI is not a signatory to this agreement, it does

appear that SEPI was familiar with it and formally agreed to it; the contract bears a number of

stamps and seals, notably an apostille dated July 1, 2003.

282. The record also indicates that the Spanish Tribunal de Cuentas, which reviews on an annual
basis various activities of public sector enterprises, audited these particular agreements and
transactions. There are a number of audit reports in evidence that disclose an ongoing review of
this, and other, investments. Report No. 705 sets out in considerable detail the lengthy history of
the Spanish government’s/public sector’s involvement in the Argentine airlines and how SEPI
came to purchase the actions it held in Interinvest.' The court reviewed in some detail the various
provisions of the SPA and the contracts described above. It reviewed the transfer of the USD 300

t!7° and noted that USD 27 million were transferred from

million from SEPI to Air Comet
Interinvest’s blocked account (into which USD 300 million had been transferred) to pay a short-
term loan owed to ABN Bank.!7! It also reviews the irrevocable contribution agreement of October
15, 2001 and the agreement between Air Comet and its shareholders of December 3, 2001
(described above). The court then examined the purchase of the debts from the various creditors
rather than their payment. In reviewing what occurred, the Tribunal de Cuentas set out in detail
SEPI’s explanations: SEPI believed that the purchase (and subrogation right) as opposed to
payment of the debts was permitted by the SPA. The report also makes it plain that SEPI was fully

aware of the contract and approved it.
283. In its conclusions to Report No. 705, the Tribunal de Cuentas stated the following:

SEPI contributed USD 300 million to Interinvest which pursuant to the contract had to be used to
pay debts. From this amount, USD 273 million were used by Air Comet to purchase those debts,
leaving it subrogated in the position of the creditors against ARSA in order for it to intervene in the
re-organization proceedings of ARSA. All of this was with the consent of SEPI which even sold to
Air Comet one of its own credits owed to it by ARSA. Air Comet undertook to capitalize ARSA’s
credits within six months from the date on which the Argentine judicial authority approved the re-
arrangement plan. That deadline elapsed on 26 June 2003 and to date it is unknown whether the
contributions to ARSA’s capital were made. '7”

284. In its recommendations, the Tribunal de Cuentas states that SEPI’s conduct should comply
with the concrete terms of the privatization authorization and comply with the formal procedures
for any modifications. It also recommended that SEPI should require strict compliance with the
obligations assumed by Air Comet which remained outstanding at the time, taking into account,
in any event, the protection of the economic interests of the public sector. Finally, it also
recommended that as a general matter in privatization processes where obligations are to be
performed after the closing of the transfer contract, the privatization consultative committee be
involved until all obligations have been performed in their entirety. However, the Tribunal de
Cuentas did not recommend challenging the contract or invalidating it or any of the steps taken by

SEPI.

285. Claimants’ investment was also the subject of further review by the Tribunal de Cuentas.
In Report No. 765 dated July 19, 2007, the court again addressed the transfer of the USD
300 million and the various other post-closing obligations contained in the SPA.'% In its
conclusion, the court noted that SEPI had submitted a number of other documents, which did not
fully demonstrate that the debts had been finally contributed to ARSA. This appears to have lead
the court to again address this subject in its next report (No. 811), discussed below. The court did
note that SEPI had submitted documentation demonstrating that other requirements under the SPA,

such as Air Comet’s capital contribution of USD 50 million to ARSA, had been performed. !”4

286. A further report dated October 30, 2008 (Report No. 811) also addressed these issues.
Report No. 811 again referred to the agreements related to Claimants’ investment recording that
Interinvest and SEPI entered into the agreement of October 15, 2001 in which it was agreed that
Interinvest would purchase the liabilities (of Interinvest and the Airlines), rather than pay the
liabilities as provided for in the SPA.'% It also records that, subsequently, on December 3, 2001,
Air Comet and its shareholders signed an agreement pursuant to which Air Comet undertook to

acquire ARSA’s credits and that Air Comet would become the creditor of Interinvest/the Airlines.

Report No. 811 also recorded, as described above, that the agreement of October 15, 2001 was
recorded with a notary public and notified to SEPI for its knowledge and consent. It went on to
find that Air Comet then proceeded to purchase the credit/liabilities in December 2001 and June

2002.

287. Report No. 811 also discussed the delays in SEPI providing the court with documentation
reflecting the use of the funds provided by SEPI.'® The report states that in view of the
documentation eventually received, one could understand that the commitment undertaken by Air
Comet in the December 3, 2001 Agreement to contribute all acquired credits to ARSA’s own funds
had been accomplished, albeit more than four years late on November 21, 2007. The court
mentions that Air Comet obtained the additional benefit of receiving a larger pro rata share in
ARSA’s capital, which resulted in a reduction in the other shareholders’ interests.'77 As a result,
the report states that the money contributed, in principle, by SEPI to assist the Argentine company
could be seen as giving rise to a benefit for the purchasers (Air Comet/Claimants). The court stated
that, although this could be justified by the modifications introduced in the December 3, 2001
Agreement (the irrevocable contributions agreement, which had been notarized), this had not been

provided for in the SPA, as the latter had been authorized by the Council of Ministers.!78
288. In its conclusion, Report No. 811 states as follows:

2. SEPI contributed USD 300 million to Interinvest that, under the Agreement, should have
been allocated to the payment of liabilities of the Argentine group. From that amount Air Comet
used 273 million with SEPI’s consent, to purchase those liabilities and undertook to capitalize the
credits in ARSA by June 26, 2003. The documents finally furnished by SEPI with its allegations
evidence that the liabilities were ultimately contributed to ARSA’s capital, although with more than
four years’ delay.!7

289. Although Respondent argues that the purchase of ARSA’s debt and subrogation to ARSA’s

"8 The Tribunal notes that although the report referenced other disputes between SEPI and Air Comet relating to
certain contingencies that had arisen after the execution of the SPA, there is no indication of a dispute between SEPI
and Air Comet relating to the contribution or use of funds paid by SEPI under the SPA (i.e. the USD 300 million or
the USD 248 million for the implementation of the Business Plan).

that SEPI was, indeed, aware of the purchase of the debt and subrogation by Air Comet and
consented, as found by the Spanish audit court. In these circumstances, it appears that while the
acquisition and subrogation may not have been in accordance with the SPA as originally
contemplated, the parties subsequently agreed to a different handling of the USD 300 million
contributed by SEPI. There is no indication that SEPI ever complained of this or that it sought to
annul the SPA on this basis. In fact, SEPI’s position before the Tribunal de Cuentas was that this
was permitted by the SPA. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that there is no basis to
conclude that the alleged non-compliance with the terms of the SPA has been made out nor that
any deviation from the original terms of the SPA would provide a basis for finding that the
transaction was illegal or would justify declining jurisdiction on the basis that the investment was

not made “in accordance with [Argentina’s] legislation”. !*!

290. Respondent also alleges that the acquisition of ARSA’s debt and subrogation by Air Comet
was in breach of Argentine law.'*? The Tribunal notes that these arguments were not very well
developed. Despite this, the Tribunal has considered these arguments and notes that the Argentine
courts reviewed the handling of ARSA’s re-organization proceedings and approved of the various

steps throughout.

291. The re-organization proceedings of ARSA were finally concluded by the Argentine courts
in June 2011.'* The Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ submission that the ARSA re-organization
proceedings were the proper place to raise any alleged illegality or impropriety related to the
investment and the record appears to indicate that Respondent did not do so at the time. The
Tribunal has taken into account Respondent’s assertion that the termination of ARSA’s
reorganization proceedings in the Argentine courts in no way prejudges the legality of Claimants’

actions during the reorganization proceedings. '*+ However, Respondent has failed to establish in

this arbitration any basis on which the Tribunal could find that the acquisition of ARSA’s debt and

subrogation by Air Comet in and of itself was in breach of Argentine law.

292. Respondent’s arguments regarding the effect of the Spanish criminal court proceedings
relating to the tax treatment of Air Comet’s acquisition of ARSA’s liabilities will be addressed

below. !85

293. Respondent further argues that Air Comet’s acquisition of ARSA’s debt and subrogation
and Interinvest’s subsequent capitalization of the credits contributed by Air Comet unduly diluted
its holdings in ARSA and AUSA.!*° As noted above at paragraph 273, Respondent asserts the
Argentine Republic’s interest was reduced from 5.34% to 1.34%, which it says resulted in it being
reduced to a “passive shareholder’. Respondent has not explained how this effect of the treatment
of ARSA’s debt was improper. Claimants admit that the capitalization of credits resulted in the
reduction in Respondent’s shareholding and note that Respondent was offered the opportunity to
make capital contributions at the time, which would have avoided the dilution in its shareholding,
and declined to do so. The dilution of Respondent’s shareholding was the consequence of the
capitalization and Respondent could have avoided that consequence by making its own capital
contribution. Having determined that the capitalization was not improper, it follows that the
resulting capital contribution and dilution of Respondent’s shareholding was also not improper.
Respondent has failed to demonstrate how simply reducing its proportionate shareholding was

contrary to any law or harmful to ARSA itself.

SEPI’s Payment of USD 248 million for Air Comet’s Industrial Plan

294. Respondent argues that Air Comet did not properly use the USD 248 million in funds from
SEPI to enact its Industrial Plan. Respondent argues that these funds were to be used for “a)
optimizing the network and routes by improving the fleet, b) improving business management

efficiency, and c) rationalizing the costs and processes through initiatives not involving payroll

reduction.” '’? Respondent argues that the certifications Air Comet obtained to prove the use of the
funds only support the bank fund movements, not the destination of the funds for specific
purposes. '** Instead, relying on its expert, KPMG, Respondent argues that these funds were used
to pay for daily operations of the Airlines.'*? Respondent’s primary issue appears to be whether
these funds were properly contributed to “executing, or for the purpose of implementing the
Industrial Plan” of the Airlines, as well as salaries.'” In this regard, it relies on KPMG’s analysis

that approximately 80% (USD 203 million) was earmarked for operating expenses.

295. Claimants argue that they applied the USD 248 million SEPI funds in accordance with the
SPA. According to Claimants, SEPI, Air Comet and Interinvest agreed that these moneys would
be transferred to Interinvest as follows: (i) USD 128 million in October 2001 after the SPA
notarization, and (ii) once Interinvest had spent and certified the use of the first USD 100 million,
SEPI would transfer to Interinvest four contributions of USD 30 million each, thus totaling the
USD 248 million committed in the SPA. SEPI would release each transfer only after receiving
from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) a certification confirming that the previous transfer was
spent in accordance with the SPA.!°! Claimants state that Interinvest then transferred most of these
amounts directly to the Airlines to be used to pay for, inter alia, their leasing installments, fuel,
salaries, repairs, airport fees, advances on purchases and taxes.'°? For each of these payments,

PwC issued a certificate justifying the use of the funds. !

296. For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not proved that
Claimants’ use of the USD 248 million was improper or illegal and, in any event, what effect any

improper or illegal use of funds would have on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

187 Resp. CM { 250. The Tribunal notes that while the SPA refers to an Industrial Plan as the basis of Air Comet’s
obligations under the SPA (designated “Exhibit I” in the SPA), the Industrial Plan is not attached to C-18, and it is not
clear whether this document has been produced elsewhere on the record. As the Parties’ arguments focused on the
obligations under the SPA, the Tribunal has, like the Parties, approached these arguments through the language of the
SPA itself.

297. The Tribunal notes that Article 9 of the SPA provides:

BUYER may allocate the amount of USD D 248,000,000 to the payments or investments to be made
by the CORPORATIONS or the COMPANY in favor of the CORPORATIONS executing, or for
the purpose of implementing, the INDUSTRIAL PLAN.

If the auditor’s certificate shows that amounts were used other than for making payments or

investments to be made by the CORPORATIONS or the COMPANY in favor of the

CORPORATIONS executing, or for the purpose of implementing, the INDUSTRIAL PLAN,

BUYER shall reimburse such amounts, although SELLER may offset them against pending

payment obligations. No reimbursed amounts may be requested again by BUYER; therefore, it will

be deemed that SELLER’s primary obligation has been reduced accordingly. !°4
298. Like the use of funds to acquire ARSA’s debts, the issues related to the use of the USD 248
million was also the subject of investigation by the Tribunal de Cuentas. The Tribunal de Cuentas
found that the USD 248 million were contributed to Interinvest and the Airlines, although the SPA
contemplated their contribution to the Industrial Plan, including the expansion of the Airlines’ fleet
and development of new routes. In its Report No. 705, the Tribunal de Cuentas reviewed the use
of these funds and found that the majority of the funds were contributed to meet operating
expenses. '® It noted that in response to inquiries from SEPI, Air Comet responded that if it had
not acted to invest the funds in operating expenses it would have been impossible to avoid the
bankruptcy since a number of the planes would have been unable to fly and salaries had to be paid.
All of this would have had a very negative effect on the implementation of the Industrial Plan.!°°
The Tribunal de Cuentas also reviewed the various responses provided by SEPI, which while
continuing to follow up and obtain further information from Air Comet, defended the use of the
funds by Air Comet and continued to advance funds until the full USD 248 million had been

transferred to Air Comet.!°”

299.  Inits Report No. 765, the Tribunal de Cuentas concluded that Air Comet had demonstrated
the contribution of 22 of the 23 additional planes which it had undertaken to supply in the SPA.!%8
Further, the Tribunal de Cuentas noted that SEPI penalized Air Comet in the amount of USD
86,957 for not supplying the last plane, as contemplated in Article 9 of the SPA set out above.
Article 7 of the SPA refers to certain specific undertakings contained within the “Plan Industrial”,
which include the maintenance of the employee headcount, contribution of USD 50 million to
capital, maintenance of a majority interest in airlines, the expansion of the routes of the Airlines

and the expansion of the fleet by a total of 23 airplanes.

300. Asin the case of USD 300 million, the evidence indicates that SEPI was aware of how Air
Comet was using the USD 248 million intended for the execution or implementation of the
Industrial Plan. Apart from applying a penalty of USD 86,957 for failure to supply one airplane,
SEPI does not appear to have invoked any contractual remedies against Air Comet for the possible
failures to comply with the terms of the SPA. Nor did SEPI or the Spanish government seek to
revoke the agreement on the basis of possible non-compliance by Air Comet. As a result, there is
no basis for the Tribunal to find that Claimants’ use of the USD 248 million was illegal or

improper.

Claimants’ own USD 50 million Capital Contribution

301. Under Article 7(c) of the SPA, Air Comet was obligated to contribute USD 50 million as

follows:

By means of a timely increase of capital, BUYER shall admit new institutional partners within a
term of NINE MONTHS since the CLOSING, and undertakes to make such a capital increase during
that term of at least USD 50,000,000 (or its equivalent in Pesos argentinos). BUYER undertakes
that at least 15% of the new partners shall be Argentine eligible investors. Such capital increase
could be made as a one-time contribution or by installments during the above mentioned period.
Compliance with this capital increase is guaranteed by a penalty clause of THREE MILLION
(3,000,000) United States Dollars (USD) to be paid by BUYER to SELLER, upon SELLER’s mere
demand, without BUYER’s right to claim any exception, as soon as it is proved that BUYER has
defaulted in its obligation and such default is not cured within a term of 4 months.

302. Respondent asserts that Air Comet did not comply with its contribution requirement,
arguing that Air Comet only paid USD 13.5 million of the total required amount and that it did so

seven months later than the time period set forth in Article 7(c) of the SPA.!°°

303. For their part, Claimants submit that, through Air Comet, they made a total cash
contribution of USD 24.2 million over the course of their management of the Airlines.” This
amount includes cash contributions of USD 13.5 million to Interinvest,?°! USD 9.9 million to
ARSA?” and USD 0.8 million to AUSA.?° Claimants do not assert that they paid in full the
USD 50 million amount required by Article 7(c).

304. The Tribunal notes that neither Party indicates that Air Comet was ever found to be in
default of its obligation to make the USD 50 million investment, nor that SEPI took any steps
under the SPA or otherwise in this regard. The obligation to contribute USD 50 million to capital
was also the subject of review by the Tribunal de Cuentas. In its Report No. 765, the Spanish Audit
Court concluded that Air Comet had complied with its obligation to increase the capital of ARSA
by USD 50 million (albeit somewhat late).?** The Tribunal de Cuentas determined that Air Comet
paid in cash approximately 25% of the amount on February 19, 2003 and the balance by February

305. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to demonstrate the alleged
breach of the SPA and that Claimants made additional capital contributions to the Airlines after

their initial investment.

2. Subsequent Investments made by Claimants

306. In response to Respondent’s claims that Claimants did not invest even one peso in the
Airlines, Claimants assert that in addition to the cash contributions they made (described above),
they also reinvested into the Airlines the USD 106 million in profits that the Airlines made during
2002, 2003 and 2004.7 As discussed further below, Claimants point to two key aspects of their
investment in the Airlines. First, they assert that Air Comet and the other companies of the Marsans
Group brought significant “synergies” to the Airlines. Second, they point to their improvement of

the Airlines’ fleet and their “massive” order of additional aircraft.

“

“Synergies” Contributed by the Marsans Group

307. Claimants assert that under their control, the Airlines became “part of a larger network of
companies specializing in air transportation and tourism, and comprising over 11,000
employees.”?°7 Claimants describe these synergies:

As any well-managed entities within an integrated group of companies, ARSA and AUSA were able

to benefit from the other companies’ activities (including sales of Viajes Marsans—the largest

Spanish travel group—or Astra’s negotiating) and resources (Air Comet’s Madrid hub to Europe,

Viajes Marsans’ access to Amadeus and IATA, to cite a few). Claimants’ management allowed the

Argentine Airlines to double-down on their strengths (in the maintenance area, for instance) and to

mitigate their liabilities (in part by sending aircraft to Air Comet).”
308. Claimants point in particular to the following benefits received by the Airlines: the
channeling of Marsans Group sales towards ARSA and AUSA; negotiating discounted rates for
Marsans Group companies; unified booking, airfare clearing and revenue management systems;
unified flight operations; unified aircraft maintenance; intercompany aircraft leasing and

reassignment and chartering; and unified aircraft purchasing.” Claimants assert that the Marsans

Group gave the Airlines preferential treatment among the Marsans companies, including the re-
booking of passengers from other Marsans Group airlines onto ARSA’s Madrid-Buenos Aires
flights, the conclusion of an agreement to use Air Comet’s fleet, the provision of free managerial
advice and assistance, and the use by other Marsans Group airlines of ARSA’s maintenance

facilities in order to generate additional revenue for ARSA.7!°

309. Respondent discounts Claimants’ so-called synergies. First, Respondent asserts that
Claimants have submitted no evidence of the alleged discounts received by the Airline through its
connection to the Marsans Group.”!! And to the contrary, the Report of Respondent’s expert,
Oliver Wyman, emphasizes the negative impact of the “synergies.” The Wyman Report notes in
particular the relatively high marketing and sales costs due to reliance on indirect sales channels,
which meant higher agency commissions, increased booking fees and a costly web booking
engine.”!?

310. Second, Respondent argues that Claimants’ alleged “synergies” amounted to no less than
asset-stripping by the Marsans Group. Arguing that “Claimants had nothing to offer the
Airlines,”?° Respondent asserts that “[i]n general, what Claimants describe as ‘benefits’ for the
Airlines were basically benefits for the Marsans Group (for example, the use of the hotels of the
latter by the crew of the Airlines, etc.). ... [I]n reality, the Marsans Group acted as a parasite of
the Airlines, taking advantage of them, extracting all it could from them, and leaving them in

appalling conditions and at the doors of bankruptcy.”?!+

Acquisition of Aircraft
311. Claimants point to Interinvest’s expansion of the Airlines’ fleet of airplanes during their
control of the Airlines. They assert that the Airlines “added” 50 airplanes between the end of 2001

and the end of 2008, although it is not entirely clear from this whether all of these planes were

contract for Boeing aircraft in 2004, “which enabled the airline to operate more long-distance
flights and to increase its passenger capacity on domestic and international routes.”?!° In 2006,

of the Airlines’ fleet with new engines and provide maintenance services.”!’ Claimants also
purchased a Boeing 737 flight simulator that they assert provided significant advantages to the

Airlines.7!8

312. Claimants point to a number of important aircraft purchases made during their management
of the Airlines, for a total of 73 new aircraft.*!° First, they point to a framework agreement the
Marsans Group (through an Irish subsidiary, Astra) entered with Airbus in July 2006 for twelve
Airbus A330-200s, six of which would go to ARSA.”° Claimants also point to subsequent
agreements concluded between Astra and Airbus to purchase the following:””! 1) five additional
Airbus A330-200s,?” 2) 42 Airbus A320-200s to be delivered from July 2010 to 2014 (Claimants
assert that “[t]his order was specifically intended for ARSA and AUSA’s fleets”), 3) ten Airbus
A350-900s to be delivered in 2014 (Claimants assert that “[t]his order was intended to supplement

the previously ordered A330-200s”),?** and 4) four Airbus A380-800s to be delivered in 2011 and

313. Respondent argues that the fleet added by Claimants “was old, with low indexes of dispatch
reliability and high fuselage deformation indexes and performance penalty.”?”° Respondent also
argues that the planes were not “acquired” but were received under leasing contracts, and as such
should not be considered as “acquisitions” that became the property of the Airlines.??’ Finally,
Respondent argues that Claimants failed to add the types and number of aircraft designated by the
2001 Share Purchase Agreement, within the timeline contemplated by the SPA.?” Respondent’s
expert, KPMG, argues that

[O]ut of the 248 million dollars destined to the Industrial Plan, AIR COMET only allocated a

reduced portion to investments, although the Plan established the need for investments to expand

the fleet. The Marsans Group incorporated old aircrafts and models different than those typified in

the purchase agreement. If it had incorporated the models established in that contract in 2001, by

2004 the airlines would have had 12 Airbus 320/321, seven Airbus 340-200/300 and another four

aircrafts of other types, a fleet that would have meant a completely different operating situation for

the airlines.72?

314. In the Tribunal’s view, it is unnecessary to decide whether these additional investments
actually qualify as investments for the purposes of founding jurisdiction. As determined in the
Decision on Jurisdiction, Claimants have met the threshold of proving an investment. The
Tribunal does not find that any of the additional evidence led by Respondent on the merits affects
this conclusion. If anything, the Tribunal has been provided with more detailed proof that, as

outlined above, qualifying investments were made.

315. The Tribunal notes that, in any event, when Air Comet took over the operation of the
Airlines, they had all but completely stopped operations and were on the verge of bankruptcies.
But for Claimants’ investment, that would have been the end of the Airlines. Rather than
completely ceasing operations (or being taken over by Respondent and operated by it), the
evidence indicates that the Airlines went back into operation and performed quite well for a
number of years. The evidence indicates that Air Comet did, in fact, invest in the Airlines by

reinvesting profits, expanding the fleet and giving the Airlines access to various benefits through

the Marsans Group’s sales and booking systems, management systems and aircraft leasing and
purchasing. The Tribunal finds that Claimants also made additional investments in the Airlines.
In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent’s arguments in response to these items really go to the value
of the Airlines and what compensation, if any, is due for their expropriation. Accordingly, the
question of whether or not Claimants reinvested profits and contributed synergies are relevant to
the value of Claimants’ investment and not its existence and will be discussed, as necessary, in the
discussion of the merits, below. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal notes that Respondent
has failed to prove its contention that Claimants’ investment was entirely opportunistic in the sense
that the investment was made in order to misappropriate the funds provided by SEPI; the evidence
clearly demonstrates that Claimants operated the Airlines for a number of years and contributed
funds provided by SEPI, as well as its own funds, to retire the debt owed to the Airlines’ creditors

at the time of investment and to the Airlines’ ongoing operations thereafter.

E. Court Proceedings Involving the Marsans Group

316. Respondent has briefed in its pleadings a number of legal proceedings involving Claimants
and the Marsans Group in Spain and Argentina. Respondent addressed most of these cases at the
jurisdictional stage of these proceedings, arguing that Claimants’ investment was therefore illegal.
In its Decision on Jurisdiction, this Tribunal rejected Respondent’s objection on the grounds that

these alleged illegalities occurred after the investment was made,”*?

although the Tribunal noted
that “certain of the allegations raised under this objection may affect the merits of the claim” and
that “it will be open to the Parties to make further submissions in respect of these allegations as

appropriate during the merits stage of the Arbitration.”*!

place within the Spanish courts and at least three different proceedings pending before Argentine

courts. A brief description of each proceeding, as characterized by the Parties, is set out below.

1. Spanish Legal Proceedings

Proceedings before Central Court for Investigative Proceedings N

318. In its objections to jurisdiction, Respondent asserted that under the terms of the 2001 Share
Purchase Agreement, SEPI was to provide funds to Air Comet, a portion of which was to be used
to cancel ARSA’s debts. According to Respondent, instead of complying with the terms of the
SPA, Air Comet used these SEPI funds to purchase the outstanding debt from the existing

creditors, thereby subrogating the claims.?°?

For Claimants’ part, they have asserted that Air
Comet’s acquisition of liabilities, the subsequent transfer of the credits to Interinvest, and the

capital increase in ARSA were all lawfully conducted.?*

319. These allegations concerning the allocation of SEPI funds have been the subject of a
preliminary criminal investigation before the Central Court for Investigative Proceedings No. 6,
against Messrs. Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias and Mata Ramayo. The Parties agree that these
allegations were dismissed on September 7, 2011, with the exception of one remaining
allegation.2* As described by Claimants, the allegations that were dismissed include the

following: crimes of falsification of Air Comet’s financial statements or books, unlawful exaction

235

of money, procedural fraud, and misappropriation of public funds. The remaining claim

concerned a crime against the Spanish Public Treasury on the basis of Air Comet’s non-payment

of corporate tax, committed with the participation or involvement of Messrs. Diaz Ferran, Pascual

Arias and Mata Ramayo.”**

320. On December 9, 2013, Criminal Central Court No. 1 of Madrid found Messrs. Diaz Ferran

and Mata Ramayo guilty of corporate tax evasion with respect to Air Comet’s failure to report the

were each sentenced to two years and two months of prison and a euro 99 million fine (which
reflected the amount of tax payable by Air Comet). On May 23, 2014, the Central Court of
Criminal Matters of the National Court of Spain dismissed the appeal of this judgment and issued

an order enforcing the sentences of Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Mata Ramayo.?**

Proceedings before Central Court in Charge of Preliminary Investigations No. 1 of Madrid
321. This criminal proceeding concerns allegations of embezzlement by Messrs. Diaz Ferran
and Pascual Arias as administrators of Viajes Marsans S.A., and Mr. Ivan Losada as administrator
of Teinver.**? For their part, Claimants argue that this event is totally unrelated to both the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal and the subject matter of this arbitration.”#° Claimants also note that
the court’s order of February 2, 2012 was to conduct a preliminary investigation against the named
individuals.**! Neither Party gave any additional information about the nature of the investigation,

the timing of the alleged embezzlement, or the nature of Claimants’ involvement in the

allegations.?4

Investigation before the Audiencia Nacional Espaiiola for “Possible Procedural Fraud”
322. Respondent makes a brief reference to an investigation in which Messrs. Diaz Ferran and

Pascual Arias are suspected of “possible procedural fraud,” namely, providing the court with false

237 RA-669. This judgment only addressed claims that Messrs. Mata Ramayo and Diaz Ferrdn, as shareholders and
directors of Air Comet, committed crimes against the Spanish Treasury by failing to pay taxes on Air Comet’s increase
in value related to the subrogation of ARSA’s debt. The Court considered the proper tax treatment for this transaction
and determined that Air Comet had failed to report a taxable benefit. The Court found Messrs. Mata Ramayo and
Diaz Ferran criminally liable for tax fraud (an offence against the Spanish Treasury). The judgment makes no finding
of fraud or harm, as it relates to the actual use of the funds Air Comet received from SEPI, to the Airlines, its creditors
or otherwise. As discussed at paras. 274-289, above, SEPI was aware of and consented to Air Comet’s use of the funds
to subrogate ARSA’s debt rather than to pay it off directly.

323. This case appears to have been brought by a creditor of the Marsans Group against

illegal acts of Mr. de Cabo’s company, Posibilitum Business S.L., with respect to former Marsans

this proceeding as a preliminary investigation.*“° Neither Party articulates a clear connection

against Dr. Mata Ramayo, a former partner of Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, and
Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of ARSA during the Marsans Group’s
administration.”4” According to Respondent, on May 17, 2013, in an order deciding to continue
preliminary proceedings, the Spanish criminal judge found that a false document had been
irregularly and belatedly included in the record of ARSA’s insolvency proceedings in Argentina.
Respondent argues that the false document relates to Dr. Mata Ramayo’s attempt to mislead the
Spanish criminal judge into concluding that Royal Romana Playa had only acted on behalf of Air

Comet, and not as the assignee of Air Comet’s creditors against ARSA.?48

326. As characterized by Respondent, this criminal proceeding involved Messrs. Diaz Ferran,
Pascual Arias, de Cabo and a number of others who are being investigated on suspicion of illegally
concealing or disposing of their assets in order to avoid the claims of their creditors.*°° The
timeline of the allegedly illegal activities is not entirely clear, although Respondent refers to
personal guarantees made by Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias starting in 2008, and it
appears that the allegedly illegal activities may have extended after the purchase of the Marsans

administrators of Viajes Marsans S.A., Viajes Crisol S.A.U., Rural Tours $.A.U., and Tiempo
Libre S.A.U.?°’ According to Respondent, on June 13, 2013, the Spanish judge characterized the

insolvency proceedings of Viajes Marsans, S.A. as culpable.?°*

In its judgment, the court
concluded that Viajes Marsans, S.A. had committed accounting irregularities, in particular by
failing to make provision for debit balances of Teinver and Air Comet, and that “... substantial
sums of money were withdrawn from the insolvent debtor VIAJES MARSANS, S.A., mainly to
be transferred to TEINVER, S.L.’s account, which led to the lack of liquidity that caused the
insolvency situation.”2°° The court decided that Mr. Diaz Ferran, the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias
and Posibilitum Business, S.L. were covered by the declaration of culpable insolvency. In that
regard, Mr. Diaz Ferran was prohibited from administering third party assets or third party entities
for 15 years, his rights as a creditor were forfeited and he was found to be jointly and severally
liable for the debts and liabilities of Viajes Marsans, S.A. not covered by the liquidation

proceedings.

330. On September 24, 2014, Commercial Court No. 12 issued a judgment classifying the

insolvency proceedings of Tiempo Libre S.A.U. as culpable.®?

In its judgment, the court
concluded that Tiempo Libre S.A.U.’s insolvency should be classified as culpable on the basis,
inter alia, of: serious accounting irregularities, including the failure to provide for debit balances
owed to Tiempo Libre S.A.U. by Air Comet, Viajes Marsans S.A. and Teinver; improper use of
the Marsans Group’s cash pooling system to provide funds to Viajes Marsans S.A., Teinver and
other affiliates; a culpable delay in filing insolvency proceedings; and failure to cooperate with the
trustees in bankruptcy. The court held that Mr. Diaz Ferran, the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias and
Posibilitum Business S.L. were affected by the classification of the insolvency proceedings as
culpable. The court went on to disqualify Mr. Diaz Ferran and Posibilitum Business S.L. from
administering third party assets or any third parties for a period of 15 years and forfeited any rights
and interests held by them as creditors of Tiempo Libre S.A.U. Further, the court held that
Mr. Diaz Ferran, the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias and Posibilitum Business S.L. were jointly and
severally liable to pay for the liabilities of, and all claims against, the insolvency estate of Tiempo

Libre S.A.U.2

331. Respondent says that this decision, together with the several other decisions of Spanish

in this arbitration. They argue that Respondent cannot prove its allegations in these proceedings

Respondent has not explained why or how the findings of the Spanish court in that matter have
any bearing on the claims in this arbitration.”

Insolvency Proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias S.A.

332. In February 2016, the Provincial Prosecutor’s office of Madrid submitted a request to
Commercial Court No. 7 for Madrid to have the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de
Cercanias S.A. declared culpable.”®’ The basis for the Provincial Prosecutor’s application appears
to be the transfer of funds received for the sale of the concession owned by Transportes de
Cercanias S.A. on or about January 29, 2010 to other companies alleged to be managed by
Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias (including Teinver and Viajes Marsans S.A.), leaving debts
of Transportes de Cercanias S.A. unpaid. In addition, there is an allegation that Transportes de
Cercanias S.A. had not produced accounting books and audits since the last fiscal report for 2008.
Respondent says that the Provincial Prosecutor’s classification of the insolvency proceedings as

culpable updates reports of one of its witnesses, Dr. Cigarran, and is relevant.

333. Claimants argue that the Provincial Prosecutor’s allegation refers to facts and allegations
unrelated and immaterial to the merits of this arbitration. They say that the events referred to in
the Provincial Prosecutor’s application all occurred after the expropriation of the Airlines and are
irrelevant to the issues before the Tribunal. Further, Claimants argue that they have been in court-
supervised insolvency proceedings for several years and have been managed only by the receivers
appointed by the competent Spanish courts. Neither the founders of the Marsans Group, nor those

who later acquired the companies of the Marsans Group, have had any involvement in the

266 Claimants’ letter dated January 7, 2015, p. 7. Claimants refer to the Decision on Jurisdiction at {| 324-328 and
argue that Respondent has not established the irregularities that it alleges in these proceedings and that no Argentine
court has found any irregularities, fraud or other form of criminal conduct regarding their investment in or management
of the Airlines in the time since their investment in 2001.

Interinvest through Air Comet in October 2001.7*> The Tribunal also found that the relevant law
is the law of the state receiving the investment: in this case, the law of Argentina.”*° The Tribunal
went on to find that Respondent had failed to discharge the onus of demonstrating, as a factual
matter, that Claimants had committed illegalities in acquiring their investment in the Airlines. In
this regard, the Tribunal found that a number of Respondent’s allegations were based on Spanish
law, while others related to performance of the terms of the SPA or other events which occurred
after the execution of the SPA by which Claimants acquired their investment.?*” The Tribunal
reached a similar conclusion with respect to Respondent’s allegation that Claimants had breached
principles of good faith when Air Comet subrogated ARSA’s creditors’ claims and when it failed

to declare this subrogation to the responsible Spanish tax authorities.?°*

344. The Tribunal’s review of Respondent’s additional submissions and the various court
decisions and documents submitted in this merits phase of the arbitration, together with Claimants’
responses, confirms the conclusions it reached in the Decision on Jurisdiction. In this regard,
Respondent’s allegations, for the most part, continue to refer to either proceedings under Spanish
law or events which occurred after Claimants’ acquisition of their investment in the Airlines and
do not affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that the relevant investments were not made
in accordance with Argentine law. The Tribunal comments on the various proceedings referred to

by Respondent in the following paragraphs.

Spanish Legal Proceedings

345. As described above, for the purpose of Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction in this
arbitration, the relevant law is the law of Argentina. Accordingly, Spanish law and Spanish law
proceedings are of limited, if any, relevance. Further, many of the proceedings raised by
Respondent do not address the legality of the acquisition of Claimants’ investment at the time it

was made, but, rather, subsequent [unrelated] events.

Proceeding before Central Court for Investigative Proceedings No. 6

346. As noted above, Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Mata Ramayo have been found guilty of
corporate tax evasion with respect to Air Comet’s failure to report the benefit it received from the
subrogation of ARSA’s debt. This conviction relates to the treatment under Spanish corporate tax
law of the benefit Air Comet received from the subrogation of ARSA’s debt after the execution of
the SPA and the transfer of funds from SEPI to Air Comet. In the Tribunal’s view, this does not

affect the legality of Claimants’ investment under Argentine law.

347. Further, as discussed above, the legality of the SPA and the various related agreements has
not been challenged in the Spanish courts, or elsewhere. As also described previously, SEPI was
aware of and consented to the subrogation of ARSA’s debt and the agreements concluded in that
regard. In addition, the Spanish Tribunal de Cuentas audited these particular agreements and
transactions and did not recommend challenging the SPA or invalidating it or any of the steps

taken to implement it.7*?

348. Finally, the Tribunal notes that all of the other allegations submitted to preliminary criminal

investigation in this matter against Mr. Diaz Ferran and others were dismissed.

351. This proceeding relates to an allegation that Dr. Mata Ramayo, a former Officer and
Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of ARSA, sought to improperly introduce a
false document into the record of ARSA’s insolvency proceedings in Argentina. Respondent
alleges that the document in question relates to an aspect of an investigation before the Argentine

no evidence of a final decision in either case.

352. In addition, the Tribunal notes that the proceedings in ARSA’s bankruptcy were concluded

and declared terminated in June and August 2011.79!

353. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to reach any firm conclusion on the status of
the allegations being investigated in the Spanish and Argentine courts. Further, on the basis of the
Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal is unable to determine what effect, if any, the allegations in
question would have on the insolvency proceedings of ARSA or the legality of Claimants’

investment in this dispute.

others. The investigation appears to have been commenced in 2012 and was set for trial by way
of an order dated April 29, 2014.7°? The timeframe during which the alleged crimes were
committed is not clear from the evidence presented, although it appears that the relevant events
occurred in 2010 when Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias are alleged to have created a plan

to remove and hide their personal assets as well as those of various companies under their control

with the assistance of Mr. de Cabo.”°? From this, it appears that the events giving rise to the

charges occurred well after Claimants’ investments were made and were expropriated in 2008.

proceedings, there does not appear to have been any conviction or final decision rendered in this

Insolvency Proceedings of Viajes Marsans, S.A. and Related Companies before Commercial
Court No. 12

356. As described above, these proceedings involve the insolvencies of Viajes Marsans, S.A.
and Tiempo Libre, S.A.U., both of which have been declared culpable and affect Mr. Diaz Ferran,
the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias and Posibilitum Business, S.L. The Tribunal was not made aware

of any appeals from these decisions or relevant developments other than those described above.”

357. It appears that the relevant events giving rise to the declaration of a culpable insolvency
commenced with what the court classified as “serious accounting irregularities” which reflected a
false view of the solvency of Viajes Marsans, S.A. in the company’s annual accounts for
2008/2009, approved on December 30, 2009. This indicates that the conduct at issue commenced
approximately one year after the formal expropriation of the shares in the Airlines. Further, the

insolvency of Viajes Marsans, S.A. cannot have affected the legality of Claimants’ investment in

concession to a third party on or about January 29, 2010. By that time, Transportes de Cercanias

had sold all its remaining shares in Air Comet to Teinver (which occurred on December 10, 2009).
Again, it also appears that the events in question occurred after the making of Claimants’
investment and after its expropriation. Finally, there does not appear to have been any decision
made by Commercial Court No. 7 of Madrid in respect of the request to have the insolvency

360. As described above, this matter involves an ongoing criminal investigation which concerns
the alleged fraudulent diversion of funds provided by SEPI to Air Comet, in breach of the SPA,
the approval of the Airlines’ 2001 balance sheet containing allegedly false entries and the alleged
misuse of monies contributed by a third party in the case of claims held by two creditors against
ARSA and which are said to be assigned to Royal Romana Playa.”** The relevant underlying facts

are disputed by the Parties.

361. The Tribunal notes that the investigation in this matter was commenced in February 2002
and is still pending. It appears that investigative interviews or depositions were taken from several
witnesses in 2010.7°? However, no decision of the court appears to have been rendered and no

further materials in respect of this proceeding were submitted in evidence.

362. In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that an investigation has been ongoing before an Argentine
court since 2002, and the materials submitted in evidence, are of little assistance in determining

whether Claimants’ investment was made in accordance with Argentine law and, consequently,

2°7 The Tribunal reaches the same conclusion with respect to the insolvency proceedings of Seguros Mercurio, S.A.
While the court in that case, Commercial Court No. 9 of Madrid, declared the insolvency of Seguros Mercuri
to be culpable, there does not appear to be any connection with Claimants’ investment in Argentina and the Air]

after Claimants’ investment in the Airlines and after its expropriation. See C-891.

entitled to protection under the Treaty. As indicated previously, where a prima facie showing of
the legality of an investment is made, the onus is on the respondent to demonstrate that the
investment was not made in accordance with the legislation of the state receiving the investment.

As the Tribunal found in the Decision on Jurisdiction, Respondent has not discharged this burden.

363. As the Tribunal also found in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the SPA and other agreements
between Air Comet and SEPI were governed by Spanish law and there has been no finding of
breach or invalidity of those agreements by the Spanish courts, or otherwise. In these proceedings,
as described above in Section D, the Tribunal has found that Claimants did, in fact, make various
investments and has found these sufficient to ground its jurisdiction. In addition, also as pointed
out in the Decision on Jurisdiction, non-compliance with performance requirements under the
SPA, which arise after the Agreement was executed, may affect certain aspects of the merits of the
dispute, provided they are adequately demonstrated. However, they do not retroactively invalidate

or render illegal the binding nature of the SPA, nor the investment it conveyed.

364. This investigation concerns alleged overbooking of tickets by the Airlines in July 2008.
For the reasons described previously, any finding that the alleged offences had occured would not
affect Claimants’ acquisition of their investment. Rather, if proved, the alleged overbooking of
tickets could be relevant to the financial position of ARSA and AUSA and affect the merits of
Claimants’ claim in so far as it was shown to affect compensation or some other relevant aspect of

the claim on its merits.

365. Further, and in any event, each Party must prove the facts upon which it relies in these
proceedings. While evidence of domestic court proceedings, including criminal proceedings, may
be of some relevance or assistance in proving a fact, it is common ground that the decision of
domestic courts are not binding on this Tribunal. In any event, the Tribunal notes that these
proceedings have been pending since November 2008 and no decision has been rendered or
submitted in these proceedings. Accordingly, the Tribunal will consider Respondent’s allegation

that the Airlines engaged in overbooking of tickets, to the extent it is relevant, later in this Award.

Criminal Case Concerning Document Forgery before Criminal Court No. 27

366. The Tribunal has addressed this issue above at paragraphs 341 and 342. As the Tribunal
has noted, this is an ongoing investigation which appears to not have been concluded. Further, in
light of the termination of ARSA’s reorganization proceedings in 2011, the Tribunal is not
pursuaded that this investigation is relevant to the question of the legality of Claimants’

investment.

Tribunal’s Conclusion on the Various Court Proceedings

367. Having carefully reviewed all of the voluminous materials relating to the various court
proceedings in Spain and Argentina, the Tribunal concludes that none of these proceedings proves
any illegality of Claimants’ investments at the time they were made or that they were not made in
accordance with the legislation of Argentina such that they should be denied protection under the

Treaty pursuant to Article II(2), or otherwise.

368. Finally, the Tribunal addresses another aspect of the court proceedings set out above upon
which Respondent relies. In this regard, Respondent says that “the events in Spain constitute the
same manoeuvres performed at the Airlines” and that “criminal and insolvency proceedings in
Spain prove that fraudulent concealment or disposal of assets have been usual practice, a modus
operandi, of the business group to which the Claimants belong.”*” Respondent suggests that this
conduct demonstrates that the same conduct occurred in the facts of this case. In the Tribunal’s
view, this is not correct. It would be inappropriate to attribute to Claimants evidence of “similar
fact” based on findings of courts in other proceedings, involving different parties, facts and
circumstances. This is particularly the case where the various criminal allegations relate to events
alleged to have occured well after the relevant period of Claimants’ investment in Argentina. Each
Party must prove the facts it alleges before this Tribunal and the findings of other courts or

tribunals will only be of limited, if any, assistance in that regard.

369. The Tribunal now turns to address the merits of the Parties’ claims.

30 Resp. Rej. | 238. See also Resp. Rej. | 285 where Respondent suggests that in view of the conduct described in
the various court proceedings, it is not difficult to understand that such facts also occurred at the Airlines under
Claimants’ management, including alleged stripping of assets and the Airlines’ critical financial situation.

Vv. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

370. In 1990, the Government of Argentina conducted an international privatization of
Argentina’s official, state-owned carrier, Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad del Estado (“AASE”),
whose assets were transferred for that purpose to a newly formed company named Aerolineas
Argentinas S.A. (“ARSA”). The winning bidder was a group of investors led by the Spanish state-
owned airlines, Iberia Lineas Aéreas de Espafia S.A.30! By way of Decree 2,201 of October 19,
1990 and the General Transfer Contract authorized by that Decree, all of AASE’s assets,
concessions and permits were sold and transferred to ARSA.* At approximately the same time,
the investor group led by Iberia acquired 85% of the shares in ARSA with Iberia itself controlling
20% of the shares.*°? By 1996, Iberia had increased its holdings in ARSA to 84%. By 2001,

that shareholding had further increased to approximately 92.1%.

371. In 1994, Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest, to serve as
the holding company for Iberia’s investments in the Airlines. As of that time, Interinvest became
the controlling shareholder in the Airlines. Subsequently, in 1995, the Spanish government
constituted SEPI to hold corporate shares owned by the Spanish government and, as a result, SEPI
acquired Iberia’s shareholding in Interinvest. In June 2001, SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest

which, in turn, held 92.1% of ARSA’s shares and 90% of AUSA’s shares.

372. Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A. (“AUSA”) was formed by two private companies which
merged in 1971 to form Austral Lineas Aereas, S.A. (“AUSTRAL”). It was subsequently
nationalized in 1980 and then privatized in 1985 when it was purchased by Cielos del Sur, S.A.7°
In 1991, Iberia acquired AUSA.* As a result, by 1991, the Spanish government, through Iberia

was a significant shareholder in the Airlines.

373. By June 2001, both Airlines were in serious financial difficulties. ARSA was under
reorganization proceedings, had liabilities exceeding USD | billion and forecasted operating
losses for the current year in excess of USD 350 million. It had also suspended flights to all but

one international destination. AUSA was also in difficult financial circumstances.*°”

374. In June 2001, SEPI announced its intention to sell its shares in Interinvest. After
conducting preliminary discussions with various potential purchasers and a preliminary evaluation
of initial offers, SEPI preselected four bidders and ultimately selected the offer made by Air

Comet.*°

375. The Government of Argentina appears to have monitored the sale process of SEPI’s
participation in Interinvest. The then Argentine Minister of Infrastructure, Mr. Carlos Bastos, was
responsible for various areas of activity, including the Subsecretariat of Commercial Air
Transportation. In that capacity, he was charged with overseeing the problems arising from
ARSA’s insolvency. He held several meetings with representatives of SEPI as well as with
representatives of the Spanish government from May to September 2001. At those meetings,
Minister Bastos explained the Argentine government’s position that it was interested in keeping
the Airlines in operation but that the Argentine government was not, in any event, willing to assist
the Airlines with an allocation of public funds. Minister Bastos also met with representatives of

the Marsans Group, including Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias.*”

376. On October 2, 2001, SEPI and Air Comet entered into the SPA, pursuant to which Air
Comet acquired 99.2% of the shares of Interinvest which, in turn, held 92.1% of ARSA’s shares
and 90% of AUSA’s shares.*!° At that time, the Government of Argentina held approximately
5.34% of ARSA’s shares.

377. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, Air Comet paid a purchase price of USD 1 for the shares

of Interinvest.>!!

Under the SPA, Air Comet agreed, in accordance with the industrial plan it
created for the Airlines, to assume the assets and liabilities of the Airlines, to retain airline
employees for two years, to make a USD 50 million capital increase, to maintain its majority
interest in the corporations, to service specified flight routes, and to expand aircraft fleets.*!? For
its part, SEPI agreed to assume the Airlines’ liabilities up to USD 300 million, and to assume
commitments resulting from the implementation of the industrial plan up to USD 248 million.*!
SEPI later agreed to contribute an additional USD 205 million to cover the operational losses

suffered by the Airlines between July and October 2001.*!*

378. Pursuant to a number of subsequent contracts, Air Comet purchased and subrogated
ARSA’s creditors’ claims rather than paying off the debts directly. ARSA’s liabilities were then
transferred to Interinvest and contributed to ARSA’s capital. As described previously, this was

done with SEPI’s knowledge and agreement.?!>

379. After the conclusion of the SPA (under Claimants’ management), the financial condition
of the Airlines improved significantly; however, ARSA’s reorganization proceedings that had
commenced in 2001 continued in Argentina for a number of years. In December 2002, ARSA and
the majority of its creditors agreed on a plan of debt restructuring, which was approved by the

380. Despite challenging conditions, including the events of September 2001 and the economic
crisis and subsequent devaluation in Argentina, the revenues and market share of the Airlines
increased substantially between 2002 and 2004. In this regard, the Airlines’ share of the Argentine
air transportation market increased from 32% in 2001 to 81% in 2004. In addition, the Airlines’
combined revenues reached ARS 2.6 billion in 2004. Further indications of the improvement in
the Airlines’ economic and financial indicators included: constant increase in revenue for both
airlines between 2002 and 2004, improving from substantial negative net income in 2001 to
positive net income of USD 12 million for AUSA and USD 32 million for ARSA;?"9 the
continuous increase in the number of passengers transported as well as the domestic and
international revenues per passenger and per kilometre for both airlines;*”° and the fact that the
Airlines recommenced operation of all previously abandoned routes both domestically and

internationally.*!

381. The Airlines also expanded and improved their fleet by renegotiating leases acquiring
various aircraft and signing a substantial leasing contract for 49 Boeing Aircraft in 2004.5”? This
was followed by plans in 2006 to modernise the Airlines’ fleet by way of substantial purchases of

aircraft from Airbus, discussed in more detail below.

382. As mentioned, the economic situation of the Airlines improved from 2002 to 2004 despite
the challenging economic conditions in Argentina at the time. These included the devaluation of
the Argentine peso in 2002, which produced a steep decline in the value of peso-denominated
airfares while the vast majority of the Airlines’ costs were denominated in US dollars. In addition,
there was a substantial increase in the price of jet fuel, which accelerated substantially as of mid-
2004. The combination of these conditions gave rise to a series of requests by the Airlines, some
of which were made in conjunction with other airlines, for increases of the airfare caps set under

Since July 2008, i.e. after Respondent expropriated the Airlines, Respondent increased airfare

 

tariffs nine times from November 2009 to May 2013.°?°

The Regulatory Framework

383. The applicable legislation governing commercial air transportation, including the granting
of airline concessions, conditions to operate and airfares, are the Aeronautics Code and the Air
Business Law.*”° The Aeronautics Code provides that the Government of Argentina, through the
Transportation Secretariat, is responsible for setting airfares.**” The Air Business Law addresses
airfares. In respect of domestic airfares, it provides in relevant part as follows:

Section 42 - Airfares shall be established taking into consideration the interests of the Nation, of the

users and of the operators, in accordance with the concept of an economically reasonable airfare for
each route and each segment.*8

application of the airfare tariffs or bands was mandatory and subject to substantial fines for non-compliance. See also
C-80: Decree 1654/2002, Article 9 and C-83: Decree 1012/2006, Article 8. This appears to have changed with respect

national authorities taking into consideration the interests of the Country, of the users and of the Argentine operators”.
The Parties are in agreement that airfares for international flights were not regulated by the Government of Argentina:

384. The Air Business Law, in Section 6, provides for the subsidization of national carriers
rendering regular air services where losses are caused by non-economically-reasonable-airfares
(tarifas-no-retributivas) (“TER”) for scheduled air services on routes declared of general interest

by Government of Argentina.

385. Article 3 of Decree 6875/1971, implemented in the same year as the Air Business Law,
addressed the content of economically reasonable airfares or the tarifa econémica retributiva

(“TER”) in more detail as follows:

Section 3 - The administrative authority [i.e. the Secretary of Transportation] shall perform the
necessary technical and economic studies to determine the economically reasonable airfare for
passengers [flights] in all the routes and segments of routes, based on the load factor approved by
the administrative authority. The airfare shall cover the direct and indirect exploitation costs for
each route or segment of route, to which an additional amount approved for each company shall be
added to account for financial costs and a margin of return.

Section 4 — The direct costs shall be calculated based on the inputs required to perform a correct
and efficient operation (fuel and lubricant, air personnel, maintenance, insurances and devaluation).
The indirect costs shall globally consist of a percentage of the direct costs, set by the application
authority [ie., the Secretary of Transportation], compatible with the national market, the
characteristics and evolution of the specific company and pro-rata according to each route or
segment of route.

Section 5 - The additional amount to cover financial costs and profitability shall result from the
following:

a) As financial cost: interest accruing on the fixed assets allocated to the service after

deducting amortization and the company’s own capital stock, using updated values
i ses, plus interest on the current assets based on a percentage of the updated
fixed assets allocated to the service, as fixed by the enforcement authority;

   

b) As profitability: interest on the Company’s own capital stock used for the operation.

The interest rates fixed by the administrative authority shall in all cases be consistent with the
characteristics of the market providing the capital.

The additional amount shall be pro rata each service rendered on routes or parts of routes.*”°

that this decree sets forth the methodology that the regulator must follow when setting TER-compliant airfares for
every domestic route. They say that the methodology is not specific to uneconomical or unprofitable routes and
provides the criteria for the calculation of economically reasonable airfares for all domestic routes. In this regard,
Claimants refer to what Respondent’s Expert, KPMG, says about the Decree at KPMG ER1, { 11.2.9. See Cl. PHB, {i

386. Also of relevance is that in 1990, when AASE was privatized and ARSA was created, the
General Transfer Contract provided as follows with respect to airfares:
the Argentine State warrants [to ARSA] that the domestic flights’ airfares will be set according to
the provisions of Law No. 19,030 [Air Business Law] (Articles 42 [i.e., the concept of an
economically reasonable airfare], 43, 44, 45 and 46) and the resolution SETOP No. 357/78, and that
international flight [airfares will be set] according to Articles 22 to 27 of the referred Law; or in

accordance with [the laws and resolutions] that eventually replace the ones mentioned, although
guaranteeing as appropriate the same objectives as the provisions mentioned.**°

387. In 1987, the Government of Argentina had introduced some flexibility into the airfare
structure by substituting an airfare band regime for the previous fixed airfare system. The new
airfare band system was introduced by Resolution No. 275/85 and later developed by Decree
2186/92. Initially, the airfare bands permitted a 20% variation in domestic passenger fares below
and above a base or reference airfare. This was later increased to 60% and then reduced to 35%.7?!
The use of airfare bands required the approving authority (the Transportation Secretariat) to
approve a base airfare or tarifa de referencia and airfares which were required to fit within the

bands set by the base airfare.

388. In October 2001, when the SPA was concluded, the airlines providing domestic services in
Argentina were engaged in an airfare war, offering very low prices in order to capture business in
a depressed market. In light of this, the Association of Argentine Airlines, (Camara de Lineas
Aéreas de la Reptiblica Argentina) (“CLARA”), wrote to the then Sub-Secretary of Transportation

to request the modification of the airfare bands regime to protect the industry from predatory

42 of the Air Business Law. They agreed that the applicable tariffs must allow the concessionaire, when operating
efficiently, to obtain proceeds in an amount adequate to cover costs of the operation, maintenance and expansion of
services, as well as a business profit: see Cl. PHB | 29 and the sources cited there.

 

Respondent disagrees with Claimants’ interpretation of Decree 6875/1971 and its relevance. Respondent, and its
expert, Ms. Donato, say that Decree 6875/1971 applies only in the case of economic subsidies provided for in
Article 6 of the Air Business Law and has no application or relevance in this case since Claimants did not request
the subsidization of any particular routes of special interest. See Resp. Rej. {] 371-374; Donato ER2, {ff 18-21, 23.

airfares and fostering an increase in demand.**? In its letter, CLARA noted that there was an
oversupply of airplanes to serve the domestic market and that costs had increased significantly due
to taxes, the privatization of airports and the increase in the costs of supplies and materials. This
situation had been aggravated by the state of the air transportation market after September 11,
2001. CLARA went on to request a modification of the airfare bands regime to limit maximum
tariffs to a band of 40% above the referenced tariff (to increase demand) and minimum tariffs of

30% below the reference tariff (to protect against predatory pricing).

389. By way Resolution MTCyD No. 47/2001, bands of 35% above and below the reference
airfares were established. In addition, the Resolution provided that in the case of tourist packages
and excursion tickets subject to certain conditions, the minimum band below the reference airfare

could be decreased up to 45%.>

390. In 2002, after the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, Dinar S.A., another airline operating
in the domestic market, wrote to the Secretariat of Transportation requesting an average increase
of 73% with a narrowing of the airfare bands to 25% above or below the reference tariff.*** On
May 17, 2002, in response to Dinar S.A.’s proposal, which appears to have been circulated by the
Secretariat of Transportation, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary to provide their views. The
Airlines stated that Dinar S.A.’s proposal was not commercially viable and proposed, instead,
gradual increases in the airfares until a balanced fare structure was achieved. The Airlines went
on to propose a table of airfares which appear to have provided for an average increase of
approximately 34% with respect to maximum airfares.**> In addition, the Airlines expressed the
view that airfares were better regulated by the market and that there should be a gradual removal
of tariffs as was the case in international transportation and in the majority of developed national

markets.

391. Subsequently, the Government of Argentina approved four increases to the base airfare

between 2002 and 2008. The first of these occurred in September 2002 with the enactment of

33? RA-538: letter of October 12, 2001 from CLARA.

Decree 1654/02.**° In that decree, the government declared a State of Emergency in the air
transport sector, noting the costs of the commercial air transport sector, including a high percentage
of imported inputs and the increase in domestic inputs such as fuel and the need to adopt policies
designed to offset existing imbalances so that airlines could continue to operate. The decree went
on to provide for a nominal increase in the airfare caps for domestic flights by approximately 41%
and to re-establish the airfare bands at approximately 60%.**” In addition, Decree 1654/2002
instructed the Ministry of Economy to submit to the Executive Branch, for submission to Congress,
a bill covering a variety of measures intended to assist air transport operators, including a cut in
the value-added tax (VAT) for fuel, an exemption from VAT on insurance contracts, and a number
of other exemptions and flexibility to permit the use of VAT to cover other costs. It does not
appear that the said bill was ever adopted by Congress or that the measures it contained were ever

implemented.

392. By way of Decree 71/2003, dated May 29, 2003, Mr. Ricardo Cirielli was appointed
Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Among his duties, the Undersecretary of Air Transportation
was responsible for overseeing and regulating all matters pertaining to the air transport industry
and reported directly to the Secretary of Transportation at the time, Mr. Ricardo Jaime. At that
time, and since 1992, Mr. Cirielli had been the Secretary General of one of the larger labor unions
in the Argentine air transportation sector, the Association of Aeronautics Technical Personnel
(“APTA”).*°8 As the head of APTA, Mr. Cirielli had opposed the investment by Spanish

of 20%. According to Claimants, this was insufficient to account for the consequences of the devaluation and the

absence from his position as Secretary General of APTA.*“”

393. By way of Resolution ST No. 369 dated June 7, 2004 and Resolution ST No. 102 dated
March 3, 2005, the Secretariat of Transportation renewed for a period of 15 years the concessions
for many of ARSA’s national and international routes which were about to expire.*! The renewal
of the remaining routes was deferred since the concessions for these routes remained in force for

a number of years.

394. The continuous increase in the costs faced by air carriers operating in Argentina led to a
written request on October 4, 2004 by the Airlines to the Argentine Secretary of Transportation
for an airfare increase. In their request, the Airlines cited the steady increase in the price of crude
oil and jet fuel which, at that point, accounted for 36% of ARSA’s costs. Due to these costs,
according to the Airlines, the fares and rates charged by them were out of step with the cost
increases and did not comply with the economically reasonable airfare (TER) principle established
in the Air Business Law. As a result, the Airlines requested an increase of 8% to the reference

rates and/or cap rate upon which they were required to base their fares.*47

395. On December 28, 2004, the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Jaime, rejected the Airlines’
request for a fare increase. This decision was based on two technical reports issued by the Office
of the Undersecretariat of Aerocommercial Transportation, and the recommendation of
Mr. Cirielli, who, in turn, based his recommendation to deny the requests on the same reports.*43
While the technical reports on which the recommendation and decision to deny the price increase
were based acknowledged the increase in the price of fuel, they concluded that an airfare increase

was not warranted because the Airlines had increased certain airfares since the enactment of

 

349 C110: APTA press communication, May 28, 2003. In his press release, Mr. Cirielli noted that while he temporarily
left his functions as Secretary General of APTA and president of another union, OSPTA, this did not mean in any way
that he would stop following closely all decisions and actions taken by APTA or that he gave up in any way his
personal concern for the future of APTA.

appealed the decisions to reject their request for an airfare increase. These appeals were denied in
March 2005 on the basis of reports prepared by the Office of the Undersecretary of

Aerocommercial Transportation.*4°

396. In 2005, the Airlines’ fuel and other costs continued to increase. In addition, the Airlines

suffered a series of strikes by APTA and the Air Pilots Union.*#°

397. On November 15, 2005, the Federal Court of Appeal in contentious-administrative matters
for the city of Buenos Aires found that Mr. Cirielli had a conflict of interest with respect to a
number of matters concerning ARSA.*4” This decision was the result of an administrative motion

which ARSA had filed with the Secretary of Air Transportation requesting that Mr. Cirielli recuse

4 C-82: technical reports, p. 10 of 7 [sic]. The technical reports concluded, in part, as follows:
[The] increases in the price of oil cannot be deemed to be permanent, at least for
the time being, and, accordingly, it appears to be inadvisable to authorize
permanent rate increases that are inflexible to a decrease just to account for
temporary cost increases.

Moreover, the cost increases we have analyzed do not seem to disrupt the
company’s economic equation, which yields considerable positive margins in the
domestic market.

345 RA-338, Cl Reply 177 . The report concluded, in relevant part as follows:

Finally, it must be noted that the need for an airfare review arises from the fall in
the company’s profitability, and not out of an increase in the cost of one
production supply only [...].

 

The results indicate that, since the macroeconomic collapse in early 2002, the
c[Argentine Airlines’ ] operating profits from domestic flights have experienced -
according to [their] own data - a substantial recovery of around 38%.

Such recovery is mostly due to three main factors:

(a) increases in maximum allowed airfares (Decree 1654-/2002);

(b) a higher concentration of airfares in the upper end of the authorized

airfare band, and;

the substantial increase in demand associated with the economy’s

recovery.

Claimants maintain that the denial of the airfare increase requested was in contravention of the regulatory framework
on the basis that airfares were required to be set by the Secretariat of Transportation taking into account: direct costs
(including the price of fuel and salaries); indirect costs (calculated as a percentage of direct costs); financial costs; and
a margin of return for operators. According to Claimants, if an air carrier’s revenues increased or if it had achieved a
profit, this did not disentitle it to an airfare increase on the basis of increases in co: See Cl. Reply {J 177-179.

himself with respect to the matters in question involving ARSA. The Secretary of Air
Transportation denied the request and the matter proceeded through the courts by way of a judicial
complaint. This decision was followed by a decision on March 29, 2006 by the Anti-Corruption
Office of the Argentine Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, issued in response to a complaint
filed by ARSA in 2003. The Anti-Corruption Office found that Mr. Cirielli had a conflict of
interest vis-a-vis ARSA and held that he was required to “refrain from any direct or indirect

9348

involvement in any cases in which...ARSA has any interest. Mr. Cirielli remained in his

position as Undersecretary of Air Transportation until December 2007.

398. In November 2005, APTA and the Air Pilots Association, APLA, organized a strike which
lasted nine days. Although the strike affected all airlines operating in Argentina, it appears to have
affected the Airlines particularly severely. At the request of the Government of Argentina, Mr.
Diaz Ferran travelled to Buenos Aires to negotiate a resolution to the strike. A series of meetings
occurred between Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Alberto Fernandez, the President’s then Chief of Staff,
and President Kirchner. According to Mr. Diaz Ferran, he told Mr. Fernandez that it would not be
possible to increase salaries unless the government immediately increased airfares which had not
had any increase in three years. Again, according to Mr. Diaz Ferran, at the President’s request,
the leaders of the two unions, APTA and APLA, joined the meetings, and a provisional agreement
was reached that the government would provide increases in airfares and fuel subsidies and the
unions would moderate their wage demands. Final wage increases would then be negotiated and
become effective when the fare increases promised by the government became effective.*“?
Subsequently, Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias met with the President’s Chief of Staff, Mr.
Fernandez, and the Argentine Minister of Economy, Ms. Felisa Miceli, who were in Madrid for an
official visit. During the course of the meeting, according to Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Fernandez
confirmed the Government of Argentina’s commitment to increase the airfares and to provide

subsidies for jet fuel in early 2006.7”

399. In February 2006, the office of the Undersecretariat of Aerocommercial Transportation
prepared a report on changes in macro-economic conditions and company profitability in the air
transport sector since the implementation of Decree 1654/2002.**! The report noted that for well-
known reasons, air transport companies had suffered the impact of a more than substantial increase
in certain relevant supplies, particularly fuel. It also noted that the impact was even more dramatic
in Argentina given the effect of the exchange rate following devaluation. It went on to note that
the price of jet fuel had increased by 97% since 2002, shortly after the implementation of Decree
1654/2002, and by 42.11% between September 2004 and the end of 2005. It also noted that, as a
result, based on data supplied by a company that provided almost exclusively domestic flight
services, the share of “fuels” in that company’s “costs of services provided” had increased from

26.47% in 2002 to 37.85% in 2003 and 41.47% in 2004.3?

400. By the end of March 2006, no airfare increases or fuel subsidies had been implemented.
At that time, a number of reports appeared in the media describing the President’s alleged plan to

take over the Airlines.*°

401. In May 2006, faced with the unions’ demands for wage increases and no increase in the
airfares, Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias requested a meeting with the Argentine
government to address the situation. Meetings were then held with the President of Argentina, his
Chief of Staff, Mr. Fernandez, and others. According to Mr. Diaz Ferran, the President and Mr.
Fernandez again confirmed their undertaking to increase airfares but that they required a solution

to the dispute with the unions first. The Airlines then negotiated and concluded an agreement with

APTA and APLA including significant wage increases of approximately 25%.***

351 €-862. The report was authored by the same economist who had prepared the reports in response to the Airlines’
request for an airfare increase in 2004, described above at { 395. The report goes on to state that it has taken into
account the evolution of certain variables, including the price of jet fuel. It also notes that since Decree 1654/2002,
the air transport companies had requested increases in the air tariffs on various occasions in October 2004. In that
regard, the report indicates that it has attempted to evaluate changes since that time as well.

352 C_862, pp 1-2. The report also noted that price levels in economy, such as salaries, had increased between 18% and
57% since the implementation of Decree 1654/2002 and between 10% and 26.8% since October 2004 to date. The
report concluded that in light of the cost increases reviewed, the costs structure of the air transport companies could
be expected to have been affected.

402. Inthe meantime, the Government of Argentina had judicially challenged ARSA’s financial
statements for 2002, 2003 and 2004.*55

403. Negotiations with representatives of the Argentine government continued.*°° Eventually,

Mr. Diaz Ferran and Secretary Jaime reached an agreement in mid-June 2006 and agreed that the

 

contract would be executed in Madrid during an official visit by President Kirchner. After what
appear to have been hectic and controversial last-minute negotiations, an agreement entitled
“Letter of Intent between the National State and Argentine Airlines S.A. and Interinvest S.A.” (the

“2006 Agreement”) and an Addendum (the “2006 Addendum”) were signed on June 21, 2006.°57

404. The 2006 Agreement was signed on behalf of the Government of Argentina by the Minister
of Federal Planning and the Minister of Economy and on behalf of the Airlines by ARSA and

Interinvest. The 2006 Agreement reads in relevant part as follows:

1. It is the parties’ intention to discuss the following agenda at the next Annual/Special
Meeting of the Stockholders of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A.:

(a) Approval of the Financial Statements for fiscal year 2005.

(b) Increase or modification of the capital stock, in an amount such that the Class “A” share of
the total capital stock will, including the existing stockholdings, reach at least five percent (5%) and
up to twenty percent (20%) thereof. This increase or, as the case may be, modification will be paid

213. As mentioned previously, Respondent says that the contribution of the claims purchased by Air Comet to
ARSA’s capital gave Air Comet a higher proportional interest in ARSA’s capital and diluted Respondent’s interest.
Claimants submit that there was no basis for the challenge to the financial statements, which caused the Airlines harm
by affecting their ability to obtain credit. They also allege that the challenge to the financial statements was part of
Respondent's hostile treatment in support of its plan to “re-Argentinize” the Airlines. Respondent, on the other hand,
argues that Air Comet’s purchase of ARSA’s debt and subrogation to ARSA’s creditors’ claims and capitalization of
the credits, with the resulting dilution of its interest in ARSA from 5.34% down to 1.34%, was a maneuver to deprive
it of rights as a shareholder: Resp. Rej. {f 211-213: Resp. CM if 438-444.

356 According to Mr. Diaz Ferran , during these negotiations Secretary Jaime informed him that the Government of
Argentina would increase the airfares and withdraw judicial challenges against ARSA’s financial statements only if
the government was allowed to increase its control and shareholding participation in ARSA. See Diaz Ferran WS,
44. Respondent maintains that there was no link between the 2006 Agreement and the increase in airfares provided
for in Decree1012/2006 of August 7, 2006. See Resp. Rej. {ff 439-440.

357 C-134. Although both the 2006 Agreement and the 2006 Addendum bear the date June 21, 2006, it appears that
the 2006 Addendum was only signed two days after the signature of the 2006 Agreement. This was due to a dispute
between the Parties in respect of the language of one of the 2006 Agreements’ provisions (Section 1(c)(ii)) which
addressed certain voting privileges attached to the Government of Argentina’s increased shareholding of 5% provided
for in the 2006 Agreement. See also Diaz Ferran WS, {| 50-66; Cl. Mem., {{[ 200-209. See also Resp. CM {ff 432-

adoption of any strategic decision such as: (1) significant capital increases, (2) strategic

 

alliances or operations that affect the national flag carrier or that ought to be in line with
the Argentine commercial air transportation policy, (3) deciding the elimination or
reduction of commercial air transportation domestic services.

(iii) the modification of the capital stock as provided for in Section 1(b).

2. Once the agreements between the parties are completed and once the points referenced to
in Article 1 of the present agreement are approved in the Meeting of Shareholders, the National
State will relinquish the legal proceedings brought against AASA challenging the validity of the
approbation by AASA Board of Financial Statements corresponding to the fiscal years ending
31.12.2002, 31.02.2003, and 31.12.2004; all of this would be done upon AASA’s consent, and the
brief or briefs to be filed by the attorneys for the State of Argentina and the AASA would state that
each party would pay for its own costs in all the aforementioned proceedings.

3. The increase in the Class “A” share of the total capital up to twenty percent (20%) of the
Capital Stock may be made at Stockholders’ Meetings taking place after the Meeting referred to in
Section 1 hereof.

4. The parties hereby state their intention to file all the required paperwork and take all steps
required for the public offering of AASA’s stock. The State of Argentina and Interinvest will
independently determine the timing and the portion of their stake each of them will set for the public
offering, as the case may be.

 

405. The 2006 Agreement addressed and resolved a number of disputes between Respondent
and ARSA and Interinvest, including the Government of Argentina’s complaints regarding the
dilution of its shareholding in ARSA and its challenge of ARSA’s financial statements for the
years 2002, 2003 and 2004. It also provided an option to the Government of Argentina to increase
its shareholding in ARSA to 20%. Although not referred to in the 2006 Agreement, it was followed

shortly by an increase in airfares of approximately 20%, as described below.

406. The Addendum reads in relevant part as follows:

substantial reduction, shall ensure the compliance with the application of the economically
reasonable airfare (art. 42, Law No. 19,030).

 

 

3. As regards Section 3, the State of Argentina hereby reserves a period of one year to make
such a decision.

407. The signature of the 2006 Addendum resolved a dispute relating to the text of
Section 1(c)(ii) of the 2006 Agreement. Claimants allege that Secretary Jaime had modified the
text of the 2006 Agreement in a manner inconsistent with what they say had been the agreement
negotiated between Mr. Diaz Ferran and Secretary Jaime relating to certain rights which would
attach to Respondent’s increased shareholdings of 5% in ARSA.*** According to Claimants, the
2006 Addendum reflects the original agreement reached between Mr. Diaz Ferran and Secretary
Jaime.**° Amongst other things, the 2006 Addendum modified the text of the 2006 Agreement to
require the favorable vote of Respondent’s Class A shares by its two appointees to the Board of
ARSA only in the case of elimination or substantial reduction of commercial air transportation
domestic services. Further, it provided that if Respondent’s representatives voted against the
elimination or substantial reduction of services, the Government of Argentina would be required
to ensure compliance with the application of the economically reasonable airfares pursuant to Law
19,030, Article 42 in respect of unprofitable routes. The 2006 Addendum also deleted the
requirement for the favorable vote of the government’s shares in order to approve the adoption of
any strategic decision of the company and limited the decision on which a favorable vote of the

government’s shares would be required to the specific decisions listed.

408. On August 7, 2006, the Government of Argentina adopted Decree 1012/2006. In that
Decree, the government recognized the very difficult circumstances (“State of Emergency”) in the
air transport sector and provided for a number of measures to address this, including an increase
in airfares of approximately 20%, the preparation of a bill proposing cuts in VAT for fuel, a VAT
exemption for aircraft purchased or leased with a purchase option, and a VAT exemption applied
to insurance policies purchased outside Argentina. It also provided for a subsidy for fuel costs for

domestic air transportation. Decree 1012/2006 reads in relevant part as follows:

WHEREAS:

... Specifically, the causes of the deep-rooted crisis of this sector are, among others, the
tight credit that prevents airlines from securing financing, the increase in the price of
aviation fuel, the higher insurance costs, and the direct incidence of leasing costs when it
is impossible to buy new aircraft, the increase in the price of spare parts, and the tax
compliance burden to companies.

..-Therefore, it has become necessary to reformulate the state of emergency of the air
transport sector within the framework of Law No. 25,561, as amended, and to adopt
policies designed to offset existing imbalances that airlines need to continue operating and
growing...

...In that scenario, it is considered advisable to adopt tax measures that might help the
companies in the commercial air transport sector to mitigate the effects of cost increases
due to structural changes within Argentina, the changes that the September 11, 2001, events
brought about, and the consequences of hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, all of which had an
impact on the price of aviation fuel.

...The changes in the way airlines get new aircraft have resulted in the increased
importance of leasing to the detriment of purchasing. Hence, both methods should be
treated equally for tax purposes, since those changes are more based on swings in the
market than on decisions made by airlines.

... The impact of aviation fuel on the companies’ cost structure and the increases in costs
make it advisable to apply a differential tax treatment, exempting sales of imported aviation
fuel from the payment of Value Added Tax.

...Finally, to the high cost of aviation fuel, it is advisable to adjust the base airfare set by
Decree No. 1654/02, which is used to determine the prices charged to the public by
operators of scheduled domestic air transport services for passengers, and maintain
unchanged the price range established by Decree No. 1654/02. The increase will be
considered for the purposes of the economically reasonable airfare as set forth by Section
42 of Law No. 19,030, to be authorized in future by the OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT under the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING,
PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES, as Enforcement Authority.”

 

Both the legal system and current economic reality are obviously different from those
existing at the time the Aeronautical Code was enacted. Law No. 17,285 (Aeronautical

The increase set forth in the preceding paragraph shall be considered on account of the
economically viable [reasonable] fare determined by Section 42 of Law No. 19,030 to be
authorized in future by the OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
TRANSPORT under the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC
INVESTMENT AND SERVICES, as Enforcement Authority. ..>°°
409. Following the adoption of Decree 1012/2006, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary of
Transportation in August and October 2006 to explain, inter alia, that the increase in airfares
provided by Decree 1012/2006 was insufficient to allow the Airlines to obtain economically
reasonable airfares.*°! In its letter of August 18, 2006, ARSA requested that domestic tariffs be
fixed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Air Business Law and Resolution SETOP No.
357/78 and the General Transfer Contract. It also requested that the tax measures provided for in
Decree 1012/2006 be implemented, noting that similar measures contained in Decree 1654/2002
had never been implemented.* In their letter of October 20, 2006, the Airlines advised the
Secretary of Transportation that the fuel subsidy (“RCCA”) to be implemented by way of
Resolution No. 812/2006 was insufficient to cover the economic effects of an economically
reasonable airfare and the increase of costs, particularly with respect to fuel, and the effects of the
devaluation of 2001/2002. As a result, the Airlines requested, amongst other things, the
reconsideration and increase of the jet fuel subsidy (RCCA) implemented by Decree 1012/2006
and Resolution No. 812/2006.°°

410. In November 2006, the Government of Argentina increased its participation in ARSA from

1.2% to 5%. As had been agreed in the 2006 Agreement, Interinvest transferred to the government

36 €-83. According to Claimants, only the increase in airfares and the subsidy on aviation fuels (RRCA) were
implemented. No tax bills were approved by Congress. Claimants say that the increase in airfares of approximately
20% was inadequate to account for rising costs and did not meet the requirements for providing an “economically
reasonable airfare” under the terms of the Air Business Law. See Cl. Mem. {{] 213-214. Claimants also say that the
20% increase was not what had been promised in the negotiations leading up to the 2006 Agreement. With respect to
the subsidy on air fuel, Claimants say that it accounted only for 4.5% of the Airlines’ fuel costs for domestic routes:

of air fuels (RCCA) provided for in Decree 1012/2006.

362 C72, pp 1-2. The letter also indicated ARSA’s agreement with the reference in Decree 1012/2006 to a bill for the
updating of the Aeronautical Code (adopted in 1967) to reflect changes in the industry since that time and international
developments.

appointment of one regular and one alternate member of the statutory audit committee and two
regular directors and two alternate directors were approved and the members of the audit
committee were appointed. It appears that Respondent’s representatives on ARSA’s Board of
Directors attended and actively participated in meetings and that Respondent was also represented

at shareholders’ meetings.*®

411. In December 2006, the Government of Argentina withdrew its complaints challenging
ARSA’s financial statements for 2002, 2003 and 2004.°°° = In addition, Respondent’s
representatives on the Board of Directors voted to approve ARSA’s financial statements for the
fiscal year end of December 31, 2005.*°” After certain rectifications made to the draft financial

statements, the 2005 financial statements were formally approved.***

412. In 2007, the Airlines’ financial difficulties continued. The Airlines again suffered a series

of strikes related primarily to demands for wage increases.*”

413. In April 2007, representatives of the Airlines again met with Secretary Jaime to discuss the
need to revise airfares for domestic flights. In their letter of April 4, 2007, the Airlines again
submitted that the airfares provided for in Decree 1012/2006 were far from allowing the Airlines
to achieve the economically reasonable airfare referred to in the Decree. The Airlines went on to
point out that in addition to other steadily increasing costs, the salary demands (in the
neighborhood of approximately 24% increases) from the various unions which represented the

Airlines’ employees substantially affected their overall cost structure. The letter requested a

minimum airfare increase of 15%, which would allow them to address increases in certain costs
and salary increases, but would still leave the Airlines far from achieving economically reasonable
airfares.*”° This letter was followed by a series of letters from the Association of Major Airlines

Operating in Argentina, CLARA.?7!

414. In September 2007, it was reported that the Airlines had suffered approximately 20 strikes
during the course of the year, or approximately a strike every 15 days.*” In addition, jet fuel prices
continued to rise. By the end of 2007, ARSA’s financial condition had further deteriorated:

EBITDA for 2007 was USD 4 million, net losses were USD 116 million and there had been an

increase in the company’s accounts payable of USD 34 million over 2006.°7

415. During the course of the Iberia-American Summit in Chile in November 2007, Mr. Diaz
Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias met with Mr. and Mrs. Kirchner and President José Luis Zapatero to
discuss the state of the Airlines.°”* According to Claimants, during that discussion, Mr and Mrs.

Kirchner indicated that the Government of Argentina had no interest in buying out the Airlines

following up on its letter of May 2, 2007 to which it had received no reply and stating that the increasing costs faced
by airlines and regulated tariffs were preventing its member airlines from covering their costs. This letter requested
measures permitting the Airlines to increase their revenues from domestic air transportation, including, in the short
term, an increase in the minimum and maximum airfare bands approved under Decree 1012/2006 and, in the medium
term, a progressive deregulation of the domestic air transportation market. CLARA recognized that the mismatch
between costs and airfares could not be cured by simply increasing airfares since this would affect demand. In this
regard, it requested the implementation of the tax measures covered by the bill to be prepared pursuant to
Decree 1012/2006. See also C-77: CLARA’s letter of November 8, 2007 requesting an immediate increase of air
fares of 40% and the implementation of the tax measures set out in Decree 1012/2006. The letter also stated that if
this were not done, the Airlines would not be able to cover their costs, much less consider investing in more aircrafts
or their modernization.

the Airlines’ problems.*”>

416. In November 2007, the Government of Argentina gave notice of its intention to exercise
its option to purchase an additional 15% of ARSA’s shares.*”° However, it does not appear that

the option was ever exercised or implemented.

417. In January 2008, Mr. Pascual Arias and Mr. Diaz Ferran were contacted by Mr. Manuel
Vazquez, who told them that he represented a group of investors interested in purchasing ARSA
and AUSA.3”” Eventually, after various exchanges and negotiations, an offer was made to Air
Comet to purchase its shares in Interinvest for the amount of USD 150 million. This offer was

rejected as too low.*78

418. It appears that, in parallel, discussions regarding airfares had been continuing between the
Airlines and the Secretary of Transportation. On March 26, 2008, ARSA wrote to the Secretary
of Transportation to provide information requested by the Secretariat in the course of recent
meetings in respect of the possible impact of measures being considered by the Secretariat.*”? In
this regard, ARSA stated its understanding that the measures in question were an airfare increase
of approximately 30% and the fixing of the maximum price of jet fuel at ARS 1.80 per liter in all
airports in the country and went on to list the monthly increase in flights to various destinations

that the implementation of such measures would permit. It also provided information on increased

flights in the event that the Secretariat also updated the index in the RCCA regime (dealing with
subsidization of jet fuel). The letter also went on to state that despite the measures proposed by
the Secretariat, for a number of other destinations, increasing, or even maintaining, flight schedules
was not economically viable in light of the costs and low occupancy rates for those destinations.
In regard of these, ARSA stated that in order for it and AUSA to be able to assure the proposed
increases in flight frequencies throughout the country and to ensure a minimum of one flight daily
to the majority of destinations, Government of Argentina would have to pay for empty seats to
economically unviable destinations. ARSA noted that without payment for empty seats on flights
to the destinations in question, the other measures proposed by the government would not be
sufficient to cover the cost of increased flight frequency requested by the Secretariat nor to
maintain the current flight frequencies. ARSA also stated that it was important that the measures
provided for in Decree 1012/2006 be implemented since these had not, to date, been adopted by

the Argentine Congress.

419. On April 11, 2008, the Secretary of Transportation issued Resolution No. 257/2008 which
increased airfares by approximately 18% for economy-class fares.*®’ Resolution No. 257/2008

reads, in relevant part, as follows:

WHEREAS, pursuant to Decree No. 1012/06, Section 6, the air fare increase thereby
authorized is to be deemed an increase authorized towards such remunerative fare as, in
accordance with Law No. 19,030, Section 42, the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING
PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES’ OFFICE OF TRANSPORTATION may
authorize in the future, in its capacity as the Enforcing Authority for commercial air
transportation.

WHEREAS, subsequently to the issue of said Decree, the airlines’ costs have materially
and repeatedly increased, in particular jet fuel costs — as a result of international and local
contingencies — as well as payroll costs, which rose as a result of salary adjustments.

WHEREAS, in combination with the steady increase in the cost of aircraft leases, spare
parts, insurance and IT services, this situation warrants a revision of the fares currently
charged for domestic flights.

WHEREAS, various government authorities and institutions from several provinces have
expressed to us their concerns over the need to increase the offering of flights to the

380 C-181/RA-341: Resolution No. 257/2008. It appears common ground that the airfare increase granted was in the
approximate amount of 18%. The same is true with respect to Resolution No. 315/2008 dated May 16, 2008: C-
182/RA-342.

provinces, as the number of flights has declined as a result of the state of emergency that
was declared by means of Decree No. 1654/02.

WHEREAS, accordingly, the economic-financial situation needs to be adjusted with a view
to achieving equilibrium at acceptable occupancy rates for said services.

WHEREAS, given the complexity inherent in the determination of air transportation costs,
the fact that such costs are dependent upon international and local variables, and the fact
that they have considerable weight in the definition of a satisfactory adjustment procedure
that can continue to be applied over time, external technical assistance has been sought to
determine the remunerative fares for Argentina’s commercial air transportation market.

 

WHEREAS, accordingly, until such time as that has been achieved, the applicable increase
is to be supplemented with the scheme established by Decree No. 1012/06, Section 3,
which scheme shall be deemed to be supplementary and applied towards future fares,
entirely in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the aforementioned Decree.

WHEREAS, in accordance with Annex I, Section 6(a) - AIR FARES FOR DOMESTIC
TRANSPORTATION of Resolution No. 1532, issued on November 27, 1998 by the
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND PUBLIC WORKS AND SERVICES, the fares
applicable to any type of commercial air transportation of passengers are the ones notified
by the carrier to the relevant authorities and/or approved by the latter, as published and in
force as of the issue of the air carriage contract.

WHEREAS, considering the above, the commercial airlines shall submit for approval the
air fares to be applied to such differential intermediate or business class services as they
may offer for regular domestic flights, and the Enforcing Authority shall reserve the right
to define the regulatory aspects that are to apply at the time of assessing said fares for
approval.

 

 

 

WHEREAS, for such purpose, in its capacity as the Enforcing Authority for Decree No.
1012/06, this OFFICE OF TRANSPORTATION shall use international custom and usage
and the rules set by the INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (IATA)
as reference.

Section 1. The operators of regular domestic air passenger transportation services are
hereby authorized to apply, effective at 00:00 on the day following the day of publication
of this Resolution, the economy-class fares in the fare brackets between the reference rate
and the maximum fare for each of the points of origination-destination described in Annex
I, which is an integral part hereof.

The increase provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be supplemented with the
scheme established by Decree No. 1012/06, Section 3 and shall apply on account of such
fare as may be established, as a result of bringing it in line with the provisions of Law No.
19,030, Section 42.

Section 2. Commercial airlines shall submit for approval by this OFFICE OF
TRANSPORTATION the air fares to be applied to such differential intermediate or

business class services as they may offer for regular domestic flights, and this authority
shall reserve the right to define the conditions that will apply to services of this sort.**!

420. It appears that the first time a distinction was made between economy and business class
in legislation relating to airfares was in Resolution No. 257/2008. After Resolution No. 257/2008
subsequent resolutions all made the same distinction and adopted the same language as used in the
Resolution.**? There is a dispute between the Parties as to whether Resolution No. 257/2008
deregulated airfares for business class such that these fares were no longer subject to the airfare
caps as of the date of the Resolution or whether, according to Respondent, the regulation of tariffs

only ever applied to economy-class fares.**?

421. In mid-April 2008, Mr. Pascual Arias was contacted by Mr. Ernesto Gutiérrez, an
Argentine businessman who led a number of businesses, including Aeropuertos Argentina 2000,

the concessionaire for the operation of airports in Argentina.**

Mr. Gutiérrez indicated to
Mr. Pascual Arias that he had been asked to act as an intermediary for the purpose of allowing
Argentine investors to acquire a share in ARSA and to increase Government of Argentina’s
holding in the company. Later, in May 2008, Mr. Gutiérrez introduced Mr. Lépez Mena, a

successful Argentine-Uruguayan entrepreneur, as an interested purchaser.**°

422. Inthe meantime, the financial condition of the Airlines had continued to worsen. On April
29, 2008, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary of Transport, Mr. Jaime to request urgent measures
to ensure the continuity of flight services by the Airlines. That letter reads in relevant part as

follows:

The purpose of this letter is to make the Secretary of Transportation aware of the
circumstances that have prejudiced the Company and could lead to a standstill of

1654/2002 and 1012/2006 that declared a state of emergency for commercial air transport
in Argentina.

In 2007, though with partial reductions in flight frequencies, Argentine Airlines’ operations
covered the whole of the country. However, as shown by studies conducted by your Office
and recent Resolution 257/2008, we are operating many of our routes at a loss. Of course,
there are no other airlines providing flight services on loss-making routes.

So far in 2008, the price of fuel has increased in excess of 40%, deteriorating even more
ARSA’s income vs. cost ratio. In spite of that, the Argentine Airlines continued providing
regular services throughout the country.

 

Please find below a more detailed description of the events that have been affecting us in
the last few months, which we request to be urgently attended to in order to prevent further
deterioration.

Also, we need an urgent solution to the problems we are having with YPF to supply the
fuel needed for our aircraft, since we are not receiving the funds committed to us.

Failure to approve the Set of Measures requested before, that were to be implemented last
January | but became gradually delayed as time went on, resulted in Aerolineas Argentina
showing a loss in excess of USD 100,000,000 in net income and expenses during the first
quarter of 200!

     

After the issue of Resolution 257/08 last April 14, no progress was made in establishing an
average reference price for domestic fuel. If a price similar to that of August 2006 had been
fixed in the first quarter of this year, our cost of fuel would have been reduced by an amount
slightly over USD 30,000,000.

 

Furthermore, there has been no rise in air fares truly reflecting the rise in costs since August
2006, the date of the last increase. Although the Office of the Secretary of Transportation
recognized a 70% gap between them, no more than an initial 18% increase was granted,
far from the minimum 33% planned under the Set of Measures. It should be taken into
account that the company’s traffic demand rose to a peak between January | and April 14
this year, for which reason income lost on a monthly basis is fairly higher than the annual
average.

 

Should the 33% increase had been approved last January 1, the company would have made,
approximately, USD 45,000,000 more than it billed for the period.

Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral would have had USD 17,000,000 more at their disposal
if laws on VAT exemption for fuel, insurance and aircraft leasing had become effective
last January 1, as provided for in Executive Order 1012/06 of August 2006.

Failure to update the Aviation Fuel Subsidy Scheme for destinations where the airfare is
below the cost per kilometer resulted in the company not receiving USD 10,000,000 in
additional subsidies during the first quarter of 2008.

From the USD 50,000,000 loan agreed upon with Banco de la Nacidn Argentina there are

still USD 18,000,000 pending disbursement. We request the Secretary to take action so that
the balance is disbursed as soon as possible.

So far we have described the USD 102,000,000 shortfall in the first quarter of this year. If
the provisions of Executive Order 1012/2006 had been applied since it was issued, that is
to say, since September 2006 through April 2008, the relevant figures would range between
USD 390,000,000 and USD 450,000,000, depending on the minimum prices (ARS 2.28 or
1.85 set per liter of aviation fuel. The Secretary [of State] surely understands that, without
that money, the project of both the workers and the shareholders of Aerolineas Argentinas
and Austral is not feasible.

In view of the above, I emphasize the urgency of dealing with the matters affecting th:

423. In May 2008, Mr. Lopez Mena agreed with Mr. Pascual Arias as representative of the Air
Comet — Interinvest Group to enter into due diligence regarding both ARSA and AUSA.*°”

424. On May 15, 2008, the Government of Argentina and the shareholders of the Air
Comet/Interinvest Group and the Airlines signed a framework agreement (acuerdo marco) relating
to the viability of the Airlines and the allocation of their capital stock (the “May 2008
Agreement”). The May 2008 Agreement reads in relevant part as follows:

The first party acts for and on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of State for Transport

of the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services of Argentina, and of

the Ministry of Economy, respectively (hereinafter, the “Argentine State”).

The second party acts for and on behalf of Air Comet S.A. and Interinvest, both companies

being representatives of the majority shareholders of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and
Austral Lineas Aéreas — Cielos del Sur S.A. (hereinafter, the “Shareholders”).

 

 

Both parties acknowledge each other’s full legal capacity to assume the undertakings set
forth in this Master Agreement”.

WHEREAS

ONE: The Shareholders and the Argentine State are aware of the serious situation
confronting Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (hereinafter, “AEROLINEAS”) and Austral
Lineas Aéreas — Cielos del Sur S.A. (hereinafter, “AUSTRAL”), and wish both of them a

future committed to providing better quality and more efficient services to the Argentine
market, for the benefit of the employees of both AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.

TWO: The Shareholders and the Argentine State are aware that, in order to make
AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL viable, it is essential that both companies reach the
stability necessary to provide a safe, reasonable operation of the services for the benefit of
the passengers and the Argentine air traffic. It is necessary to establish social and labor
conditions for the different categories and, particularly, for the group of pilots, similar to
those applied by world leading airlines, so that the Aerolineas Argentinas Group is able to
compete in the global aviation market.

 

THREE: The Shareholders and the Argentine State are aware of the difficulties faced by
AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL, and believe that a new allocation of the capital stock and
the enforcement of measures intended to streamline transportation costs and taxes, as
contemplated in this Master Agreement, could bring about a solution to those difficulties.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in order to fulfill the above purposes, the Shareholders and the
Argentine State, acting willingly and in good faith hereunder, agree to perform the
Following

TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

 

1.1. AEROLINEAS

The Shareholders and the Argentine State undertake to take all such steps as may be
necessary to reallocate the shares, for the primary purpose of reaching the necessary
stability to make AEROLINEAS viable. For that purpose, the reallocation of shares
mutually agreed by the parties shall be as follows:

   

. The Argentine State will increase its direct interest from the current 5% to a
minimum 20% of the capital stock of AEROL[NEAS; the employees may hold a
maximum 10% of the capital stock. The Argentine State may modify these
percentage interests in order to admit interested Provinces as new shareholders.

. The private sector shall hold 70% of the capital stock of AEROLINEAS through an
intermediary Argentine company in which the Shareholders will directly or
indirectly hold 48% of the capital stock, and a local group made up of various
Argentine private companies will hold the remaining 52%.

. To fix the price to be paid for the increase in the public sector’s interest and in the
Argentine private company’s interest in the capital stock of AEROLINEAS, the
average of the appraisals conducted by three consulting firms with expertise in
international quality appraisals selected by the Shareholders with the approval of the
Argentine State shall be used, and the consulting firms will be provided updated
information and a projection for the next FIVE (5) years.

 

Once the capital is structured as indicated herein and simultaneously with the
implementation of that structure, the Shareholders shall have the option to sell, which the
Argentine State and the remaining direct or indirect holders of the AEROLINEAS’ capital
stock shall accept, the 48% of the capital stock directly or indirectly held by them in the
intermediary company that directly holds 70% of the AEROL{NEAS’ capital stock, to be

that will determine the new capital structure of AEROLINEAS as agreed herein, at the
minimum price to be determined at the time of execution of the transaction agreed herein.

1.2. AUSTRAL

Prior to the execution of the transaction agreed upon in paragraph 1.1 hereof, the
Shareholders and the Argentine State undertake that AEROL{NEAS shall purchase 100%
of AUSTRAL’s capital stock from its current owners, at a price to be determined by the
average of the appraisals conducted by three first rate, internationally recognized entities
specializing in the purchase and/or appraisal of international companies in this industry,
selected by the Shareholders with the approval of the Argentine State, which are
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley.

AEROLINEAS shall provide the private and public funding required for undertaking all of
the transactions contemplated in this Master Agreement for the purchase of AUSTRAL,
pro rata the percentage interest proposed for each of the Parties. If applicable, the Central
Bank of Argentina will be requested to consider the possibility that 30% of the funding
coming from abroad be exempted from the deposit obligation.

It is of the essence of this Master Agreement that the proceeds from the agreed upon
transactions be allowed to be remitted abroad, in accordance with the legislation applicable
as of the date hereof, without any exception or additional limitation or restriction.

Payment in full of the undertaking between the Argentine State and the Shareholders in
this paragraph 1.2 shall be a condition for carrying out the agreement described in
paragraph 1.1 hereof.

TWO: Viability Measures for AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.

In addition to the agreements described in Clause One above, the Shareholders and the
Argentine State undertake to promote such action and formalities as are required to

2.10 To renew the fleet and grant fiscal facilities for that purpose on a case-by-case basis.
2.11 To resolve the problem of AEROLINEAS’ cumulative indebtedness.

million based on a DCF valuation (which ranged between USD 611 and USD 737 million) and a multiples
valuation which ranged between USD 237 and USD 692 million.

. PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ valuations of AUSA resulted in an equity value of between USD 303 and USD 381

granted a second airfare increase of 18% by way of Resolution ST No. 315/08.7”

428. Mr. Lopez Mena did not proceed with the investment to purchase a controlling share in
ARSA’s new holding company under the structure established in the May 2008 Agreement.

Accordingly, the transaction envisaged in the May 2008 Agreement failed. *°?

429. Following the failure of the May 2008 Agreement, a number of meetings and negotiations
between representatives of Interinvest and the Government of Argentina took place regarding the
sale of the Airlines to the government. Negotiations were tense and difficult. The Spanish
Ambassador to Argentina and embassy assisted Claimants and it appears that the Spanish Minister

of Foreign Affairs interceded on behalf of Claimants.***

430. At the same time, the financial condition of the Airlines continued to deteriorate. It appears
that there was some concern that the Airlines would be unable to meet their payroll and social
security contributions. As a result, a number of the unions who represented the employees of the
Airlines made a submission in the insolvency proceedings of ARSA (which had been commenced
in 2001 and had not yet been concluded) advising of the difficult economic and operational
circumstances of ARSA and requesting measures to ensure that sums owing to the employees
would be paid.*”* This led to an agreement between the Ministry of Labor and the Secretary of
Transportation and various unions pursuant to which the latter agreed to ensure continuing service

for a period of 60 days.*°° On July 11, 2008, the Ministry of Federal Planning, the Ministry of

proceedings requesting various interim measures.**”

431. In June 2008, the manner in which the Secretariat of Transportation provided fuel subsidies
was modified. On June 19, 2008, the Secretary of Transportation entered into an agreement with
YPF, Shell and Esso pursuant to which they would supply jet fuel at the subsidized price of
ARS 1.85 per liter for all airlines providing domestic passenger air transport.*?* The agreement
set out the volume of jet fuel to be supplied and provided that Government of Argentina would
pay the supply companies the difference between the subsidized price and the current price of jet

fuel.

for the payment of various sums to the Airlines in order to pay wages and operating expenses to

ARGENTINA shall appoint the General Manager of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL for

the execution of all final documents, the broadest statutory guarantees will be given.

437. On July 18, 2008, the court hearing the applications of the unions and the Government
reviewed the difficult circumstances faced by the Airlines, including the number of operational
aircraft, the significant liabilities of the Airlines and the fact that the Secretary of Transportation
had adopted measures to pay wages owing for the month of June as well as critical operational
expenses. The judge noted that the original agreement with ARSA’s creditors had been performed
and practically concluded and had been approved (homologated). Accordingly, ARSA’s
remaining obligation was to fully complete the approved agreement with creditors. In these
circumstances, the judge appears to have concluded that his remaining jurisdiction did not include
the various protective measures recently requested by the unions and Government of Argentina,
particularly where Government of Argentina had exercised its authority to ensure the ongoing

operation of the Airlines by way of its relevant entities.**

438. On July 24, 2008, the Government of Argentina submitted the July 2008 Agreement for
approval by the Argentine Congress. This was done by way of a bill for the “repossession”
(“rescate’’) of the Airlines by the purchase of their shares. The bill was also accompanied by a

Presidential message.*°

439. On July 29, 2008, Interinvest wrote to Argentina's Minister of Federal Planning,
Mr. De Vido to complain about a number of statements made in the Presidential message which,
according to Interinvest, were unnecessary, inaccurate and in breach of the Agreement reached on

July 21, 2008 to avoid unjustified accusations. °°

that he had found that ARSA had not been as diligent as he would have expected with respect to its obligation to
collaborate and provide information to the court until the conclusion of its bankruptcy proceedings: see RA-459, pp. 6-

during the debate of the Repossession Bill.”

441. On September 1, 2008, Mr. Mujfioz Pérez appeared before the Argentine Senate to address

the purchase and sale of the Airlines and questions regarding the management of the Airlines.*°

442. On September 18, 2008, the Argentine Congress enacted Law 26,412 which approved the
“repossession” (rescate) of the Airlines (and their subsidiaries, Optar S.A., Jet Paq S.A. and
Aerohandling S.A.) by way of a purchase of their shares. The Law provided that compensation
would be calculated by the Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Nacion (“TTN”). Law 26,412 provided
in relevant part as follows:

SECTION 1 - In order to guarantee the public service of commercial air transport for passengers,

mail and cargo, the Argentine State shall redeem the shares in Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral

Lineas Aéreas - Cielos del Sur S.A, and any other company owned by them (Optar S.A., Jet Paq S.A.,
Aerohandling S.A.) by purchasing their capital stock.

 

 

SECTION 2 - The National Valuation Office shall assess the companies Aerolineas Argentinas S.A.
and Austral Lineas Aéreas - Cielos del Sur S.A, pursuant to Section | hereof. Valuations will be
carried out taking into consideration the values prevailing as of July 1, 2008. The Joint Committee
of the House and the Senate for State Reform and Privatization Follow Up created under Section 14
of Law 23,696, shall supervise valuations, ensuring that they take into account the companies’ actual

407 See C-196: transcript of Secretary Jaime’s Statement before the National Congress, August 6, 2008. In his
appearance before Congress, Secretary Jaime stated, inter alia, the following:

 

My opinion, or at least what we expressed, is that the National State through the
relevant agencies must fix the price of the shares which is related to the assets and
liabilities of both companies. The business group presents its valuation on both
companies. Obviously if there is no agreement, we will elevate the matter to
Congress for its consideration. The Executive Power and the company have
recourse to a third valuation, which will be presented to Congress for its approval.

That is to say, the final valuation which is done by the third company. (p. 42 of 49)

I repeat that the methodology is that the National State determines the value

through the relevant agencies. I clarify that as the National State there is no other

way of determining value. Of course we can permit the company which wishes to

sell to determine the value. And finally, if there is no coincidence nor agreement,

there would be recourse to a third valuation by international entities. Surely we

would look at entities such as, for example, the Organization for International Civil

Aviation - OACI. But that would be determined in the case that there was no

coincidence. (p. 43 of 49) [Tribunal’s translation]
408 C-1104. In his comments, Mr. Mufioz Pérez stated, inter alia, that Interinvest had agreed to sell the Airlines since
it was impossible to continue managing the companies in the face of the permanent situation harassment by the trade
union leadership, whose agenda was for Marsans to leave the country, and the absence of an adequate State Aero-
commercial Policy. See C-1104, p. 2.

of the bill to Congress.*!°

444. In October 2008, valuations of the Airlines were prepared by Credit Suisse on behalf of

Interinvest, and the TTN. Credit Suisse’s aggregate valuations for the Airlines ranged between

USD 330 and USD 540 million.*!! The TTN’s valuation concluded that the Airlines had a
negative value of ARS 2,540,338,289 (approximately USD 832 million at the time).*!*

445. It appears that the TTN and Credit Suisse met on a number of occasions with respect to the

valuation of the Airlines.4!

446. Onbehalf of the Federal Ministry of Planning, Mr. Rafael Llorens raised a number of issues
regarding the authorship and formal presentation of the Credit Suisse report and requested
additional information which he said was required to adequately assess Credit Suisse’s

valuation.*"4

447. On October 29, 2008, Mr. Llorens, the Legal Sub-Secretary of the Ministry of Planning,
and Mr. Martin, a member of the TTN, met with a representative of Interinvest and representatives
of Credit Suisse from New York. During the course of their discussion, Credit Suisse’s
representative, Mr. Buenaventura, confirmed that he was a representative of Credit Suisse who
authored the report and that, normally, Credit Suisse does not sign the reports it prepares. He also
confirmed that the Credit Suisse report valued the two Airlines, adding that the report should not
be considered an independent valuation, as it was based on financial information provided by

management.*!>

Secretary of Transportation of October 14, 2008, copied to Minister De Vido and the Spanish Minister of Industry and
the Spanish Ambassador to Argentina: C-205.

412 See C-204: the TTN’s Valuation dated October 10, 2008. This valuation was on a “substantive patrimonial value”
or asset value basis. In addition, the valuation report records that the TTN had also performed a valuation on a DCF
basis which also yielded a negative value (ARS -1,897,854/USD -622,235,362). The TTN’s alternative valuation was
conducted making different assumptions, including five years of cash flows and no terminal value for the Airlines. It
also applied discount rates in pesos to cash flows in U.S. dollars and did not adjust airfares in proportion to cost
increases. See Transcript pp. 683-687; Martin WS Ex. 19, pp. 1939-1940, 1945-1946, 1953. In his testimony before
the Argentine Congress, Mr. Martin explained that the valuation conducted by the TTN was different from the one
agreed in the July 2008 Agreement: see C-1092 pp. 58-65.

The TTN also confirmed its initial valuation of October 2008 in a supplementary report dated November 12, 2008. In
that report, the TTN also responded to comments made by Interinvest in a letter dated October 23, 2008 (C-380). In
January 2009, the TTN prepared a second valuation report for the expropriation process commenced pursuant to Law
No. 26,466 (C-379). This valuation valued the Airlines at ARS 3,087,748,413 (USD 894,999,525).

448. On the same date, Interinvest wrote to Ministers De Vido and Jaime to complain about
what it referred to as the government’s formalistic requirements that Credit Suisse’s valuation
report had to be signed, accredited and notarized. Interinvest noted that it was customary practice
for international valuation firms to identify their valuations by way of their letterhead without a
formal signature or other formalities. Interinvest also responded to the government’s suggestions
that the additional information submitted with Credit Suisse’s valuation was insufficient.
Interinvest expressed the view that the supplementary documentation supplied was more
voluminous than the details supplied with the TTN’s valuation. In addition, the Interinvest
representatives noted that despite the exchange of supplementary information, there had been no
agreement on the transfer price for the shares in the Airlines. The letter went on to request the

selection of a third-party valuator, pursuant to the terms of the July 2008 Agreement.*!®

449. In early November 2008, there were a number of exchanges between Interinvest and
Mr. Llorens regarding the government’s request that all documents and reports mentioned in
Credit Suisse’s valuation report and supplementary documents be produced to it. In his
correspondence, Mr. Llorens stated that Interinvest had failed to produce information and
documentation requested by him and listed a number of other questions and information he

maintained were needed.*!”

450. In its response of November 10, 2008, Interinvest stated that the formalities that had been
requested by the Government had not been agreed and were not required pursuant to the terms of
the July 2008 Agreement. Interinvest went on to state that it had produced the information and
documentation requested of it although it had not been agreed or required to be produced.
Interinvest also confirmed that it had provided to the government a signed and apostilled copy of
the Credit Suisse valuation report.*'® In response to the additional request for information,
Interinvest stated that the period for discussions between the Parties of the price for the shares of

the Airlines on the basis of the valuations exchanged had expired. It went on to request, on an

of valuing the Airlines pursuant to the terms of the July 2008 Agreement.*!?

451. On November 12, 2008, Interinvest wrote to Secretary Jaime to request that the Transition
Committee established in the July 2008 Agreement meet since, as of October 8, 2008, Argentina’s
representatives on the Transition Committee had not attended any of the committee’s weekly
meetings. As a result, the general manager appointed under the terms of the July 2008 Agreement

(Mr. Julio Alak) was managing the Airlines without the guidance of the Transition Committee.*”°

452. On November 21, 2008, Interinvest was served with a Notice of Preliminary Injunction
obtained by the Government of Argentina. The Preliminary Injunction ordered that there should
be no change in the membership of the Board of Directors of the Airlines nor in the role of Mr. Alak
in his roles as a Director and the General Manager of the Airlines. In addition, a court officer was

appointed to report to the court about the operation of the Airlines.*?!

453. Onthe same date, a draft bill of a law expropriating the shares of the Airlines was submitted

to the Argentine Congress.*?”

454. On December 17, 2008, the Argentine Chamber of Deputies adopted Law 26,466 which
authorized the expropriation of Interinvest’s shares in the Airlines.*?? Law 26,466 provided in

relevant part (in Spanish) as follows:

ARTICLE 1 — In compliance with Article 1 of Law No. 26,412, the shares of Aerolineas
Argentinas Sociedad Anénima and Austral Lineas Aéreas Cielos del Sur Sociedad

information relating to the Airlines and the approval of the financial statements of the Airlines at July 17, 2008.

Planning to exercise all the rights of the shares in the Airlines until the expropriation process under

Law 26,466 was completed.*?+

inform it whether it accepted that valuation.*?5

457. On January 21, 2009, Interinvest rejected the TTN’s valuation, referring to what it stated
had been Argentina’s confiscatory process. Interinvest also repeated its previous objections to the

TTN’s valuations.“

458. As Claimants rejected the TTN’s Valuation, the Government of Argentina commenced an
expropriation lawsuit against Interinvest (the “Expropriation Lawsuit”). In the meantime, the

administrative entity created by Decree 2347 had been appointed to exercise all rights granted by

the shares of the Airlines.‘?”

performed exclusively on the substantive or patrimonial value method, provided for in Article 10 of Law No. 21,499.
#26 C-216: Interinvest’s letter of January 21, 2009. In its letter, Interinvest states that the valuation of the Airlines set
out in Resolution 36/09 did not reflect the fair market value of the shares of the Airlines and did not compensate for
the harm it maintained that Argentina’s previous conduct had caused to the airlines. The letter then went on to state
that in order to obtain full compensation, Teinver, Autobuses Urbanos and Transportes de Cercanfas would continue
with the international arbitration commenced before ICSID. In this regard, Interinvest had submitted to the Argentine
government a letter from the three Claimants advising of their decision to submit their dispute to the ICSID pursuant

459. Commencing in November 2008, representatives of Interinvest and of Respondent had
discussed the possible settlement of the disputes between them. Pursuant to the discussions
between the parties and the drafts exchanged, Interinvest would agree to the sale of the shares of
the Airlines for a nominal price of 1 Peso in exchange for the Government of Argentina taking
steps to acquire 35 of the aircraft that ASTRA had previously committed to purchase from Airbus,

plus various additional concessions.*7*

These discussions took place from November 2008
through February 2009. The first draft of the agreement under discussion was dated December 1,

2008.

460. On January 21, 2009, Secretary of Transport Jaime wrote to Airbus to indicate the
Government of Argentina’s interest in purchasing 35 aircraft that ASTRA had ordered from
Airbus. Mr. Jaime’s letter added that the Government of Argentina’s interest in the aircraft was
related to the delivery dates or slots for aircraft to be delivered to ASTRA and asked that Airbus
do what it could to expedite discussions and negotiations with all parties involved so that the
acquisition could take place as soon as possible.*°

461. Following this, on January 24, 2009, Airbus’ Contracts Division prepared a draft
Memorandum of Agreement between it and the Argentine Federal Ministry of Planning which
provided that the Government of Argentina committed to purchase and take delivery of 35
specified aircraft and make an initial payment in an amount which would cover pre-delivery

payments plus an additional USD 150 million.*”°

of the initial payment would be used to satisfy Argentina’s PDPs due upon the signature of a purchase agreement.
The remainder of the initial payment (USD 150 million) was to be used by Airbus to obtain the release by ASTRA of
all its rights in respect of the aircraft subject of the Memorandum of Agreement, including payment of a termination
fee, settlement of capital and financing costs and other costs incurred by ASTRA. The draft was exchanged between
lawyers for the parties and a copy of the draft Memorandum of Agreement was sent to Mr. Manuel Vasquez, the
advisor to Secretary of Transportation Jaime, on January 26, 2009.

462. On February 8, 2009, a new draft of the agreement Interinvest and Respondent had been
negotiating was produced. It was retitled “Draft Agreement for the Implementation of Law No.

26,466” (the “Draft Agreement”) and appears to have been initialed.**!

463. In the recitals at the beginning of the Draft Agreement, the parties make reference to the
adoption of Law No. 26,466 for the expropriation of the shares of the Airlines, the fact that
pursuant to Decree 2347, the Federal Ministry of Planning had been designated as the
expropriating entity and instructed to proceed with the expropriation and that the controlling
shareholders of Interinvest had commenced an arbitration against Argentina pursuant to the terms
of the Treaty. It also stated that in view of these circumstances, the parties had reached an
agreement for the implementation of Law No. 26,466. Pursuant to the terms of the Draft
Agreement, Interinvest agreed to the transfer of all of its shares in the Airlines in exchange for the
payment of 1 Peso. For its part, Government of Argentina agreed to certain additional obligations
(compromisos adicionales), including the acquisition and acceptance of ASTRA’s rights and
obligations in respect of 35 aircraft ordered from Airbus for delivery within certain slots. In that
regard, the Draft Agreement included an obligation on the part of the Airlines (then owned by
Government of Argentina) to conclude a purchase agreement with Airbus within 30 days of the
conclusion of the Draft Agreement. Further, the purchase agreement between the Airlines and
Airbus was required to provide full and final release of all of ASTRA’s obligations under its

contracts with Airbus in respect of the aircraft in question.***

464. The Draft Agreement was never signed nor implemented. It appears that the Government
of Argentina was having difficulty securing financing for the purchase of the aircraft from Airbus.
Although discussions and negotiations continued for some time, the projected transfer of ASTRA’s

rights to purchase the aircraft from Airbus was delayed and, eventually, abandoned.*? ASTRA

431 See C-235: Acuerdo para el cumplimiento de la Ley 26,466. The agreement, which remained in draft form, was
initialled by Mr. Mufioz Pérez on behalf of Interinvest and, it is alleged, Mr. Manuel Vasquez. See Pascual Arias WS
{ 88. As discussed below, there is a dispute between the Parties as to the initials alleged to have been added to the
draft on behalf of Respondent.

482 C235, Articles 2.1 and 2.2. It appears to be common ground between the Parties that had the Draft Agreement
been signed and implemented, this would have resolved the dispute between them in respect of the expropriation of
the Airlines. See the testimony of Undersecretary Llorens: Transcript pp 619-620, 654-655; Cl. PHB {[ 156-157.

and Airbus reached a contractual arrangement to assist ASTRA to finance the purchase of certain
aircraft (Airbus A330s) which the Government of Argentina was to undertake to purchase in the
Draft Agreement. Pursuant to this arrangement, ASTRA and Airbus agreed to the termination of
various purchase agreements in order to reallocate the Pre-delivery Payments (PDPs) that ASTRA
had paid pursuant to purchase agreements for A380s, A320s and A350s to the payment of
outstanding obligations in respect of the A330s which had been purchased. As a result, all sums
invested by ASTRA in the A320s, A350s and A380s were applied to finance the purchase of the
A330s.44

465. On July 10, 2009, ASTRA and Airbus also concluded a Supplemental Agreement which
provided for the payment of a fee from Airbus to ASTRA upon the completion of an agreement
between Airbus and the Government of Argentina for the purchase of the aircraft identified in the
proposed draft Memorandum of Agreement between Airbus and the Argentine Ministry of

Planning.*?°

466. Although discussion continued between representatives of the Argentine Secretary of
Transportation and the Ministry of Planning, Interinvest and Airbus for some months, no firm
agreements were concluded. In November 2009, Airbus informed ASTRA that it was ready to
deliver the first A330 aircraft it had purchased. ASTRA was not in a position to purchase the
aircraft and, in December 2009, one of its creditors exercised its rights to take delivery and
ownership of the aircraft. In due course, ASTRA lost its right to purchase the A330 aircraft from
Airbus as well as any right to recovery of any sums paid in advance as deposits. The last contact
between Interinvest and Respondent regarding the possible purchase of the A330 aircraft took

place in January and February 2010.

467. As described above, Air Comet initiated voluntary reorganization proceedings on April 20,
2010. This was followed by the commencement of voluntary reorganization proceedings by
Teinver on December 23, 2010, by Autobuses Urbanos on January 28, 2011 and by Transportes

de Cercanias on February 16, 2011.436

468. On February 27, 2014, the Argentine Federal Administrative Court rendered its decision
on the expropriation of Interinvest’s shares in the Airlines (the “Expropriation Judgment”).*77 In
its judgment, the court accepted the valuation of the TTN, noting that it was of decisive importance.
It noted that the TTN had applied the “substantive value or patrimonial value (valor sustantivo o
patrimonial)” and considered the market value of the assets of the Airlines, using comparative or
depreciated replacement cost methodologies. It held that the discounted cash flow methodology
did not apply since it was inconsistent with the Application of Article 10 of the National Law on
Expropriation (Law No. 21,499) which provides that indemnification shall only consist of the
objective value of the asset and the damages which are the direct and immediate consequence of
the expropriation. According to the court, under the Expropriation Law hypothetical earnings,
increased value from use of the asset and lucro cesante, inter alia, are not to be taken into account.
The court held that the discounted cash flow method is based principally on projections of a
company’s performance in the future and discounting present values from future revenues for
losses and operating costs. As a result, the discounted cash flow methodology proposed by
Interinvest was based on forecast hypothetical earnings and costs and its application implied

ignoring the Expropriation Law.**

436 See Part III.B, above.

4837 C_1197.

438 Td., pp. 9-10. The court also noted that the TTN’s valuation had been adopted unanimously, in the absence of a
technical representative of Respondent, which Interinvest chose not to appoint. The court also noted that Interinvest
had not proved that the method of discounted cash flow was the valuation method for an ongoing aviation services
company — without prejudice to the issues which had been raised with respect to the allegation that the Companies
were not going concerns but, rather, in the process of dissolution for loss of share capital — which, according to the
court, was more consistent with the provisions of Article 10 of the Expropriation Law. The court also mentions that
Interinvest did not question the constitutionality of the Expropriation Law. However, Claimants say that Interinvest
did challenge the constitutionality of Law No. 26,466 (which is the law which directed the expropriation of Interinvest
and not the general Expropriation Law): see Cl. Reply {324 and C-887, p. 5: Interinvest Pleading of June 2, 2010 in
the Expropriation Lawsuit. Claimants also submit that the judge in the first instance proceedings acted arbitrarily by
preventing Interinvest from submitting key valuation issues and by not permitting Interinvest more than five days to
challenge a new report by the TTN. See Cl. Reply 327; C-888; C-889; and RA-408.

469. Interinvest appealed the first instance decision in the Expropriation Lawsuit on May 23,
2015. In April 2015, the Federal Court of Appeal in Contentious—Administrative Matters rendered
its judgment, dismissing the appeal and confirming the first instance decision (the “Expropriation
Appeal Judgment”).**° In its reasons, the Court of Appeal held that the TTN had opted for valuing
all the current and non-current assets and liabilities of the Airlines and that this was correct since
the companies were facing a loss-making economic and financial condition and, therefore, were
not in a condition to continue operating in the immediate future. The court also held that
Interinvest had not provided any evidence that the application of the discounted cash flow

methodology would or could have resulted in a positive valuation.

470. There is a dispute as to whether Interinvest appealed the Court of Appeal’s decision to the
Argentine Supreme Court. In a letter dated December 1, 2015, Claimants submitted that the
expropriation proceeding in Argentina had not ended since it had not been notified of the rejection
of its pending appeal, as alleged by Respondent.*! In submissions made during the course of
Claimants’ Third Application for Interim Measures, Respondent submitted that Claimants had not

submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court and, therefore, the Court of Appeal’s decision had

442

become binding. In the end, the evidence on this issue was not entirely clear. The Tribunal

notes that no copy of an appeal to the Supreme Court or further evidence of the filing of an appeal
was tendered by Claimants. In these circumstances, it appears that no further appeal from the

Court of Appeal’s decision was taken.

49 RA-690.

+49 See RA-690 (English version), pp. 7-11. The court states that the appellant only referred in a vague manner to the
failure to assess the value of intangible assets and did not offer any evidence that had any such assets been taken into
account, the result of the valuation would have been different. The court refers to the “...huge indebtedness of the
companies [and] the inability to face such debts on the basis of the earnings derived from the exploitation thereof...”.
The court also noted that the TTN had requested a discounted cash flow analysis from the School of Economics of the
University of Buenos Aires and that according to the latter’s analysis the application of the DCF method also resulted
in a negative result.

471. After July 2008, the Argentine Secretary of Transport issued a series of resolutions
increasing airfares in November 2009, June and July 2010, March and May 2011, February, June
and November 2012, and May and December 2013.4 On February 2, 2016, Decree 294/2016

was issued; this decree removed maximum airfare caps for domestic air transportation.*+

VI. APPLICABLE LAW

473. In their Request for Arbitration, Claimants allege that Respondent violated the Treaty,
international law and Argentine law. Specifically, Claimants allege that Respondent breached the

following obligations and standards with respect to their investment in Argentina:+”

(a) Article V of the Treaty by having nationalized, expropriated or otherwise
appropriated through measures tantamount to expropriation the Claimants’

investment without satisfying the conditions for a lawful expropriation;

(b) Article ITV(1) of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to

Claimants’ investment;

(c) Article II(2)(c) of the US-Argentina BIT, to which protection Claimants say they
are entitled pursuant to the MEN clause in the Treaty (Article IV(2)), by failing to

observe obligations Respondent entered into with regard to Claimants’ investment;

+8 See C-863: Resolution 227/2009; C-864: Resolution 118/2010; C-865: Resolution 210/2010; C-866: Resolution
64/2011; C-867: Resolution 112/2011; C-868: Resolution 23/2012; C-869: Resolution 49/2012; C-870: Resolution
7718/2008; C-871: Resolution 265/2013; C-966: Resolution 1595/2013. See also Cl. PHB {| 38-40. According to
Claimants, these airfare increases amount to an increase of 127% of the average airfare in five years. Claimants say
that if the airfare increases granted in April and May 2008, shortly before the July 2008 Agreement was concluded,
were included in the total, then the increase of the average airfare as of April 2008 amounted to 163%. Claimants
contrast this increase with the airfare increases granted during Claimants’ ownership period of almost seven years,
which Claimants say was for a total of approximately 40%. See Cl. Reply i] 148-149.

+4 See Decree 294/2016, dated February 2, 2016. Available at:

http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/ infolegInternet/anexos/255000-259999/258356/norma.htm. The Decree states in part
that maximum tariffs had hindered the development of commercial air transportation and that it was appropriate to
update the airfare regime and to maintain only reference fares on base airfares for domestic economy class. See also
Claimants’ letter of March 8, 2016 in respect of this Decree and Respondent’s response of March 21, 2016.

(d) Article III(1) of the Treaty by impairing by unjustified or discriminatory measures
the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, disposal or liquidation of

(e) Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT, through operation of the MEN clause in
the Treaty (Article IV(2)), by failing to accord full protection and security and the

treatment required by international law.

474. The Parties consented to ICSID arbitration to resolve the investment dispute. Article 42(1)
of the ICSID Convention provides:

The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the

parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State

party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law
as may be applicable.

475. The Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the
Promotion and Protection of Investments was signed on October 3, 1991 by both parties and
entered into force on September 28, 1992 (the “Treaty”).“° The Treaty is lex specialis between
Respondent and Spain, as it governs investments made by nationals of one State in the territory of
the other. The Treaty forms the legal basis for Claimants’ claims against Respondent in this
arbitration.*4” Thus, the provisions of the Treaty supersede principles of customary international

law unless those principles are general principles of international law in the nature of jus cogens.¥8
476. Regarding applicable law, Article X (5) of the Treaty provides:

The arbitral tribunal shall make its decision on the basis of this Agreement and, where appropriate,
on the basis of other treaties in force between the Parties, the domestic law of the Party in whose
territory the investment was made, including its rules of private international law, and the general
principles of international law.“

477. As an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by
international law, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention’) applies
to the interpretation of the Treaty.’ The Vienna Convention confirms that every treaty in force
is binding upon the parties and obliges parties to perform them in good faith.**! Further, parties
to treaties “may not invoke the provisions of [their] internal law as justification for [their] failure
to perform a treaty.”*°* Accordingly, Respondent may not avoid its treaty obligations owed to

Claimants by relying on its compliance with its internal laws, regulations or administrative acts.

478. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides the Tribunal with the general rules of

interpretation:

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to
the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text,
including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with
the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the
treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the
application of its provisions;

 

 

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the
parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.
4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.
479. With respect to certain claims, Respondent has stated that it is not liable for certain acts, as

they cannot be attributed to Respondent. In the context of these particular defenses, the Articles

on State Responsibility will also be relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis.

480. Accordingly, the claims and Counterclaims in this arbitration are governed by the ICSID
Convention, by the Treaty and, where the Tribunal considers appropriate, the law of Argentina and
general principles of international law. The Tribunal’s analysis in the subsequent sections of this
Award will be guided by these sources and discussed in more detail in the context of each of the

claims and Counterclaims.

VII. THE CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS - OVERVIEW

481. As has been set out in considerable detail in the previous sections of this Award, Claimants
invested in Argentina in 2001 through their indirect through Air Comet purchase of Interinvest,
which, in turn, owned the majority of the shares of the Airlines and operated the Airlines until
2008 when the Government of Argentina formally expropriated the shares of the Airlines. At the
time of Air Comet’s initial investment, the Airlines were in dire financial condition. During Air
Comet’s ownership, the financial condition of the Airlines initially improved and positive returns
were realized before the Airlines began to again experience financial difficulties. It is undisputed
that at the time of expropriation in 2008, the Airlines were again insolvent and the Government of
Argentina intervened to assist in providing funds for expenses in order to keep the Airlines in

operation.

482. Claimants allege that the declining financial condition of the Airlines and their ultimate
return to insolvency was a result of Argentina’s measures, which they assert amount to breaches
of the Treaty. Claimants complain specifically about Argentina’s refusal to increase domestic
airfares or provide other relief to ensure economically reasonable airfares; Argentina’s interference
with the management of the Airlines in pressuring the Airlines to increase wages in response to
union demands; the acts of the Undersecretary of Air Transportation; Argentina’s unjustified
challenge of the Airlines’ financial statements; Argentina’s pressure on Claimants to sell their
interest in the Airlines to an Argentine purchaser; Argentina’s breach of agreements reached with
respect to the sale of the shares and their value; and, ultimately, Argentina’s valuation of those

shares when it decided to expropriate them in 2008.

483. Argentina, instead, maintains the position that Claimants made no real investment in

Argentina at all and that their mismanagement of the Airlines was the cause of their demise.

158

Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.
v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1)
Award

 

Argentina submits that it had no choice but to expropriate the Airlines in order to maintain the vital
public service of connectivity within the country and that it was justified in paying nothing for the
shares, as the Airlines had a negative collective valuation at the time of expropriation. Further,
Argentina makes a Counterclaim in this arbitration for what it says are its losses related to

Claimants’ investment.

484. Respondent states that Claimants’ entry into the Airlines and their management of the

1453 and self-serving. Respondent asserts that Claimants

Airlines was ill-conceived, “parasitical
chose voluntarily to enter the Argentine air industry at a particularly inauspicious period that
coincided with the events of September 11, 2001 and the Argentine economic crisis.*** One of the
airlines, ARSA, was in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings at this time.*°> Further, Respondent
argues that Claimants failed to undertake a proper due diligence of the Airlines before entering the
2001 Share Purchase Agreement with SEPI, and then failed to invest in the Airlines as it was

required to do pursuant to the terms of that agreement.*°°

485. Thus, Respondent argues that it was Claimants’ management of the Airlines that led to
their grave financial and operational condition by 2008, and not State policy. In that respect,

Respondent asserts, as a defense to Claimants’ claims, that:

It has been demonstrated that the state of the Airlines by mid-2008 was not a consequence of the
actions of the Argentine State. On the contrary, the situation is attributable to the management of
the Marsans Group. It was the lack of diligence and commitment in the acquisition and management
of the Airlines, coupled with disrespect for applicable rules, that impacted on the viability of the
Airlines.*°”

Claimants attempt to have the Tribunal assume that a company in such situation, which was later
put in the hands of a group that collapsed all over the world, amidst scandals, management disasters
and fraud, would have been successful if it had not been because of the measures adopted by the
Argentine Government. But nobody could reasonably assume that that could have happened.***

... the manoeuvres of the Marsans Group led the Argentine Airlines to a situation in which the
public service of air transport of passengers, mail and cargo was jeopardized.*%?

Indeed, in 2008, the Airlines where [sic] in the same—or even worse—economic situation they were
in 2001, as a consequence of the inefficient management of the Marsans Group. Claimants’
allegation that this was the result of the airfares applied is false since, as has been explained by
KPMG, during the relevant period, the airfares affected by the regulation increased more than
costs.*0°

486. In the event that the Tribunal determines that Respondent has breached the Treaty,

Respondent argues that its measures were necessary and raises the defense of necessity.

487. In the following sections of the Award, the Tribunal will review each of Claimants’ claims

and Respondent’s defenses to those claims, as well as Respondent’s Counterclaim.

VIII. ALLEGED BREACHES OF FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

488. At the core of Claimants’ case are the allegations that Argentina treated Claimants’
investment unfairly and inequitably and, ultimately, expropriated it without paying any
compensation. Claimants allege that Respondent failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to
their investment, in violation of Article IV(1) of the Treaty. Claimants asserted that the following

acts allegedly taken by Respondent constituted FET violations:

(a) The “airfare squeeze”**!

(b) The maintenance of Undersecretary Cirielli in office**
(c) Respondent’s unjustified challenge of ARSA’s financial statements**

(d) Respondent’s acts with respect to the June 2006 agreement, including Respondent’s
coercion of Claimants to obtain additional shares at no cost, its unilateral
modification of the text of the June 2006 Agreement, and its breach of the June
2006 Agreement by failing to set TER-compliant airfares and failing to comply
with its promised 15% stock option of ARSA by invoking the corresponding cash

contributions*+

(f) The breach of the July 2008 Agreement and the subsequent de facto expropriation

(g) Respondent’s failed promise to subrogate Claimants’ Airbus orders*®

489. In general response to Claimants’ claims with respect to FET, Respondent states that
Claimants did not have a protected investment and that it acted at all times fairly and equitably
toward any investment that Claimants did make (i.e. that it met its obligations of minimum
standard of treatment at international law). The Tribunal has already determined that Claimants
had protected investments in Argentina.*°* Respondent’s specific defenses to the FET claims will

be discussed in the following sections.

A. Positions of the Parties on the Content and Scope of the FET Obligation

490. Claimants assert that the FET standard contained in Article IV(1) of the Treaty

...ig not a single monolithic standard, but encompasses several categories of conduct. Specifically,
fair and equitable treatment comprises, inter alia, the following obligations: (i) to provide investors
with a stable and predictable legal and business environment; (ii) not to frustrate an investor's
legitimate expectations; (iii) to act transparently and consistently towards investors and their
investments; (iv) to act in good faith; (v) to refrain from coercion or harassment; and (vi) to promote
and protect investment.”

 

491. Claimants stress, in particular, that case law overwhelmingly demonstrates that the FET
standard prohibits host States from engaging in conduct that frustrates the legitimate expectations
of investors.*”° They also stress that legitimate expectations can arise from contracts and specific

representations, such as in the case of Respondent’s promised subsidies and tax relief, as well as

Award

in the case of the June 2006, May 2008 and July 2008 Agreements.*”! Claimants have summarized

the fair and equitable treatment standard as follows:*”7

. The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to be “just, even-handed,
unbiased, legitimate.”

. The fair and equitable treatment standard should be ascertained in light of the object and
purpose of the treaty, which, in this case are in part to “intensify economic cooperation for
the economic benefit of both countries” and “to create favorable conditions for
investments.”

. The fair and equitable treatment standard obligates the State to respect the investor's
legitimate expectations. Furthermore, through its laws, regulations, policies and
statements, a state creates certain expectations about the treatment that an investor may

 

anticipate.
. The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to protect the stability of the
legal and business envi of the . When a state abrogates its i

and thereby violates an investor's legitimate expectations, it creates an unstable and
unpredictable legal and business environment.

. The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to refrain from conduct that is
inconsistent or lacks transparency. Thus, a state’s conduct should be free from ambiguity
or uncertainty. Accordingly, “all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating,
completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made, under
the Agreement should be capable of being readily known” by the investor.

. A finding of bad faith is not required to conclude that a state violated its obligation to treat
the investments fairly and equitably.

. The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to conform its measures and
conduct to a standard of good faith.

492. As formulated in its latest pleadings, Claimants argue that Argentina breached the FET

standard vis-a-vis Claimants’ investment in numerous respects, including the following:

(a) Argentina failed to abide by its specific commitments, promises and guarantees
regarding Claimants’ ability to charge Economically Reasonable Airfares (the

“Airfare Squeeze”);

including baseless challenges to ARSA’s financial statements, supporting APTA’s

others;

Argentina breached both the May and July 2008 Agreements and arbitrarily treated

Claimants and their investment;

Argentina further reneged on its post-expropriation promise to assume Claimants’

(e) its appointment of Mr. Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation
notwithstanding his evident bias against Claimants, and his maintenance in office
notwithstanding the existence of court and administrative rulings acknowledging

his conflict of interest with Claimants;

(f) the filing of groundless challenges to ARSA’s financial statements to then withdraw

June 2006 Agreement,

(g) its ad hoc use of de facto representatives (such as Mr. Vazquez and Mr. Gutiérrez)

for making low-ball offers to purchase the Airlines;
(h) its threats to Claimants’ representatives (such as Mr. Mujfioz Pérez); and
(i) its de facto control of the Airlines in violation of the July 2008 Agreement.*”*

494. Respondent asserts, in response, that the expression “fair and equitable treatment” as used
by Article IV(1) of the Treaty refers to the minimum standard under customary international law.
Under this standard, acts that give rise to a FET breach are those that “fall below the internationally
acceptable levels and which, when weighed against the given factual context, amount to manifest
arbitrariness, discrimination, a gross denial of justice, or a lack of due process leading to an
outcome which offends judicial propriety.”*”> Respondent asserts that none of the acts described

by Claimants rise to this level.

495. Respondent argues further that the concept of “legitimate expectations” referenced by
Claimants appears nowhere in the Treaty or other BITs concluded by Argentina. Nonetheless, even

497. The Tribunal’s findings on the scope and content of the FET obligation is set out at

paragraphs 663 to 668, below.

B. The “Airfare Squeeze”

498. Claimants contend that the Airlines, as airlines operating in Argentina, had the right under
Argentine law to charge an “economically reasonable airfare” (“TER”) the acronym for the
Spanish tarifa econémica retributiva) for domestic flights. Claimants allege that Argentina failed
to set airfares in accordance with the TER principle, and that the airfares set were too low for
Claimants to make the reasonable return to which they were entitled. Claimants argue that over
the period of their control of the Airlines (2001-2008), and in the wake of the Argentine financial
crisis and devaluation of the peso, their costs rose sharply relative to the airfares they could charge.
They argue that despite their numerous requests, Respondent failed to raise the airfares sufficiently
to reflect cost increases, which “severely harmed, and ultimately financially choked the Argentine

Airlines.”4”

499. Claimants say that the airfare squeeze breached numerous obligations owed by Respondent
under the Treaty. Claimants assert that Respondent’s failure to provide economically reasonable
airfare levels constitutes a breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) obligation set forth
in Treaty Article IV(1).**° Claimants also allege that the airfare squeeze constitutes a part of
Respondent’s indirect or “creeping” expropriation of the Airlines in violation of Treaty Article

v.*8! Finally, Claimants assert that Respondent’s failure to provide a TER constitutes a breach of

Argentina’s failure to protect Claimants under Treaty Article III(1).*8? The Tribunal will review
all of Claimants’ arguments as they relate to the airfare squeeze in this section of the Award and

return to its findings, as necessary, in subsequent sections.

500. This section will first address the Parties’ arguments with respect to the Argentine
regulatory regime that sets airfares and the concept of the “economically reasonable airfare.”
Second, it will address the Parties’ arguments regarding the acts taken by both Claimants and
Respondent with respect to the setting of airfares; these acts consist primarily of Claimants’
requests for fare increases and the allegedly inadequate responses by Respondent. Third, it will
address the Parties’ quantitative arguments with respect to the airfares. The Tribunal will then
examine whether the alleged airfare squeeze gave rise to a breach of the FET standard under the

Treaty.

1. The Regulatory Structure

501. Claimants request the Tribunal to find that Respondent was required under Argentine law
to set economically reasonable airfares for domestic routes, i.e., at levels that would have permitted
the Airlines to recover their direct, indirect and financial costs and to obtain a reasonable profit.**5
Claimants further request that the Tribunal find that Argentina, by contemporaneous conduct and
representations, acknowledged Claimants’ right to economically reasonable airfares as well as its
own failure to set airfares for the domestic passenger market in compliance with the TER-standard

from 2002 up until expropriation of the Airlines.***

Laws and regulations
Scope of regulations

502. Airfares are regulated by the Argentine government via the Air Business Law, Law
No. 19,030. Argentine regulations require Respondent to approve a base airfare or tarifa de

referencia. Argentine regulations also set both a ceiling and a floor (“airfare bands”) with reference

to the base airfare, usually by a set percentage below and above the base fare, so that the air carriers

can freely price each available seat within the upper or lower band.

503. It is undisputed by the Parties that these regulations concern only airfares for domestic
flights.4*° As such, Claimants’ allegations of the “airfare squeeze” are limited to Respondent’s
actions with respect to these domestic airfares. The regulations are further limited in scope because
they only apply to domestic tickets that are purchased within Argentina. Respondent argues,
therefore that airfare regulation in Argentina affected only “‘a small portion of the revenues of the

Airlines.”“°

504. The scope of operations of the two Airlines was different. AUSA flew almost exclusively
domestic routes and its revenues generated from those routes represented 98% of its total revenues.
On the other hand, ARSA operated a substantial number of international routes as well as domestic
routes and revenues generated from its domestic routes represented approximately 25% of its total

revenues. “8”

505. The Parties disagree on whether domestic business class fares were subject to these same

airfare regulations during the 2001-2008 period of Claimants’ management of the Airlines.

506. Claimants assert that any premium or business class airfares were regulated until 2008, and
that business fares were only deregulated as part of the April 2008 fare increases granted by the

Secretariat of Transportation. ***

507. ST Resolution No. 257 of April 2008 is entitled “A resolution authorizing the operators of
regular domestic air passenger transportation services to apply economy-class fares in certain fare
brackets. Effectiveness.” It provides, in relevant part:
Section 1. The operators of regular domestic air passenger transportation services are hereby

508. Claimants note that all resolutions relating to fare increases enacted after this resolution
likewise specify that the fare caps apply only to economy class. ST Resolution No. 315 of
May 2008, for example, is entitled “Servicios regulares de transporte aéreo interno de pasajeros.

fares or otherwise exclude business class fares.‘?!

there was some oral agreement between the companies and the Secretariat which will allow a
certain small number of seats to be sold as Business at a particular premium, and that premium

510. Respondent has asserted, in contrast, that the airfare regulations do not apply, and never
applied, to Business Class tickets.*°* Respondent has supported this assertion on the basis of the
evidence of two of its expert witnesses.*°° However, Respondent’s accounting and damages expert,
KPMG, took an inconsistent position on this issue over the course of this proceeding. In its first
expert report, it noted that “Later on, in April and May 2008, ST Resolutions No. 257 and 315,
respectively, further increased reference and maximum airfare twice by 18% for economy class,
deregulating prices to be charged for business class.”4°° During the hearing, however, KPMG
asserted that “in late January 2008, the standard or the rule allow[ed] for the deregulation of the
Business Class, but this is something that had already been done in the past,”**” and that “only the
domestic airfare was regulated for the economy seating in Argentinean pesos and sold to

Argentinean residents.”48

511. The Tribunal’s review of the regulatory framework indicates that no distinction was made
between economy and business class airfares until ST Resolution No. 257/2008. Prior to that time,
all the relevant legislation and decrees relating to airfares simply referred to the airfares and bands
in question without differentiating between economy and business class or exempting business
class from the application of the relevant airfare caps. The Tribunal notes that it was not until
Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits that it raised the argument that domestic business
class airfares were unregulated during the period of 2002 to 2008. In addition, Respondent’s
expert, KPMG, identified ST Resolution Nos. 257 and 315 as new regulations which deregulated

airfares for business class.*”? The Tribunal is not persuaded by KMPG’s explanation in cross-

examination that although the first decree to de-regulate business class airfares was adopted in

April 2008, in practice these airfares had already been deregulated.*”

512. Claimants’ experts, Messrs. Abdala and Spiller, testified that business class airfares were
not deregulated and that the airlines were not free to charge business class airfares or to re-
designate economy class seats as business class seats without the Secretariat of Transportation’s

authorization.*°!

There was some indication that airlines reached informal, oral agreements with
the Secretariat of Transportation to sell a limited number of seats as “business” or “gold” seats at
a premium. However, that premium was limited to the maximum airfare chargeable for the
equivalent regular, economy seats. As a result, the ability to convert regular seats into “business”
or “gold” seats was still limited by the maximum airfare set by decree and, therefore, was revenue

neutral.*”

As a result, to the extent there may have been some limited, informal practice of
rebranding seats, as permitted by the Secretariat, this practice was revenue neutral and did not

affect Claimants’ experts’ yield calculations.

513. The Tribunal concludes for all intents and purposes, until the adoption of ST Resolution
No. 257/2008 in April 2008, all domestic airfares, including for “business” or “gold” seats, were
regulated and subject to the reference airfares and the approved maximum airfare caps and bands

contained in the regulations.°°?

514. Finally, the Parties disagree as to whether the Airlines were required to serve specific, less

profitable routes. Claimants assert, for example, that while their domestic competitor, LAN

calculations. Further, KPMG did not offer any support for its statement at the hearing that business class airfares had
previously been deregulated.

°°3 Tn addition, the Tribunal finds Respondent’s position that business class seats were unregulated prior to April 2008

and that the airlines could have freely charged business class airfares to maximize revenue unconvincing. If this were
case, one would have expected ample evidence of the charging of substantially higher premium prices for business
class. There was no such evidence. Rather, the evidence indicates that all of the airlines operating in Argentina
repeatedly requested airfare increases throughout the period from 2004 to 2008. This included LAN Argentina, which
requested airfare increases, both in its own name and as a member of CLARA: C-75; C-76; C-77; C-967 (report of
LAN’s Board of Directors dated May 21, 2008) C-1045 (LAN’s letter of March 11, 2008 to the Secretariat of
Transportation).

Argentina “was able to select the densest and most profitable routes to serve,” the incumbent
airlines, ARSA and AUSA “were effectively required also to serve the less desirable routes that
LAN was able to avoid.”>”* Claimants’ expert, Mr. Ricover, testified that while “there is no legal
source” for this obligation placed on the Airlines, “[nJot everything in Argentina is written on
paper. Some commitments and some responsibilities are political. And I can tell you for sure that,
even if there were no specific requirements on paper, it doesn’t mean that there were not
requirements.”°°° Mr. Ricover’s position is supported by the contemporaneous correspondence

between the Airlines and Respondent.*°°

515. Respondent, on the other hand, asserts that there was no such obligation on the Airlines to
fly specific routes.°°’? Respondent refers to the testimony of its aviation law expert,
Professor Angela Marina Donato, who asserted that the provision of service along any particular
route is not imposed by Government of Argentina, but rather it is the operators who may request
to provide this service.*°* Professor Donato also testified that operators have the right to request
the suspension or interruption of the service provision if they consider that the airfare of a given
route is not profitable.*? Respondent asserts that the Airlines, under Claimants’ management,

never made such a request.

516. The Tribunal’s review of the regulatory framework for domestic air transport in Argentina
indicates that there was no formal requirement on the Airlines to fly specific routes. Accordingly,
when applying for concessions, it appears that airline companies could request the specific routes
they wished to serve. Further, the regulations permitted competition between airlines on the same
routes such that the granting of a particular concession does not appear to have granted any form
of monopoly. There was no evidence regarding the conditions under which concessions would be
granted and whether servicing other routes was a condition of approval for the granting of a

concession. However, the evidence did indicate that ARSA was considered the national flag

carrier at the time of privatization and that as part of the privatization process, the Argentine State,
as a shareholder, was granted a right of veto over the elimination or substantial reduction of
transportation services operated by the company at the time of the public tender.>!° It appears that
under Iberia’s and SEPI’s control of the Airlines, the latter operated a broad range of routes
throughout Argentina. These were covered by concessions which remained with the Airlines in
2001 when Claimants acquired the shares of Interinvest from SEPI. As indicated previously, in
2005 the Secretariat of Transportation renewed ARSA’s concessions to operate a number of routes

and deferred the renewal of other concessions which still had a number of years to run.

517. The Tribunal also notes that in 2007 and 2008, the Secretariat of Transportation raised with
the Airlines the need to provide and increase the frequency of air transportation to a number of

destinations within Argentina.>!!

It appears to be common ground that the Executive Branch of
the Government never made a declaration that any scheduled air services on certain routes or route
segments were of special interest to the Nation pursuant to the Air Business Law, Article 6 and
Decree 6875/1974, Article 2. Nor did the Airlines request payment of subsidies or compensation

pursuant to Article 6 of Law 19,030 and Decree 6875/1971.

518. However, in their letters of March 26 and April 29, 2008, the Airlines did advise the
Secretariat of Transportation that a number of their routes were unprofitable and that they would
be unable to maintain certain routes or the frequency of service of certain routes requested by the
Secretariat absent an increase in airfares and other relief, including in certain cases payment for
empty seats by the Secretariat.*'* The Tribunal also notes that pursuant to ARSA’s by-laws,
adopted by Decree 220/1990, and the terms of the 2006 Agreement and Addendum, Respondent,

as a shareholder of ARSA, had the right to veto the elimination or substantial reduction of domestic

uneconomically low airfares relates to fares for all domestic routes during the relevant period, not
just to certain specified routes. Respondent’s argument amounts to saying that the Airlines were
free to decide to stop operating all of their routes or relinquishing their concessions. In the
circumstances, this was not possible. The relevant issue is whether under the domestic legal
framework, the Airlines were entitled to charge airfares which would allow them to recover their

costs and obtain a reasonable margin of return.>!+

The Air Business Law and Decree 6875/1971

519. Article 42 of the Air Business Law, Law No. 19,030, governs the setting of airfares. The
Parties disagree on whether Article 42 establishes a “right” to a TER, on the mechanism Article
42 and other regulations use to determine whether a fare is economically reasonable, and on
whether Argentina failed to use the correct methodology to determine whether the fare is

reasonable.

@ The alleged “right” toa TER

520. Article 42 provides that

Las tarifas se establecerdn consultando los intereses de la Nacién, de los usuarios y de los
explotadores, con el concepto de tarifa econémica retributiva correspondiente a cada ruta y tramo

TER.»'° As they interpret the language of Article 42, “after the balancing of all relevant interests
(‘taking into consideration’ ), airfares must in all cases be set ‘in accordance with the concept of an

balance against the interests of the nation, the users and the operators; instead, Article 42 ensures

air carriers that the airfares set by the regulator shall not fall below that standard.”>!*

522. Claimants moreover tie the language of Article 42 to what they describe as a long-standing
tradition of just and reasonable tariffs in Argentine administrative law for public services.>!”
Claimants’ Argentine legal expert, Professor Alberto Bianchi, asserts that under this principle, “the
fare received by the service provider should be sufficient in efficient conditions in order to assure
repayment of all operating costs and a reasonable Rate of Return or reasonable profit[.]”>”°
Claimants also argue that this principle has been consistently affirmed by the Argentine Supreme

Court and is recognized by Argentine scholars, including Respondent’s legal experts.*7!

523. Respondent disagrees with Claimants’ interpretation of Article 42. First, it argues that the
TER is not a “right” that guarantees a particular level of return.°?? It asserts that Article 42 provides
no guarantee of profitability, let alone a guarantee of a constant total or unitary gross margin in
dollars.*> Second, Respondent interprets the specific language of Article 42 as balancing the
interests of three different elements: “‘a) the interests of the country (more access by users,
connectivity, the promotion of tourism, etc.), (b) the interests of users (who want a better service
price/quality ratio), and (c) the interest of the companies providing the services (who seek to
improve their profitability).”°*+ It submits as well that Article 42, as properly translated, does not

contain the phrase “in accordance with,” as Claimants have posited.*7>

524. In interpreting the legal framework governing the setting of airfares in Argentina, the
Tribunal notes that the relevant laws and decrees which applied during the course of Claimants’
investment were longstanding. The Aeronautics Code had been adopted in 1967 and the Air

Business Law and Decree 6875/1971 were both adopted in 1971.°*° The basic, general provision

governing domestic airfares is Article 42 of the Air Business Law which, unlike other laws and
regulations governing other regulated services such as gas distribution, water and sewer services,
did not provide for a detailed mechanism for the calculation of tariffs and their periodic revision.
Further, as Respondent notes, the air transport sector permitted competition and free entry by
competitors, unlike other regulated sectors in which a monopoly or oligopoly of regulated services

existed.”

While, as discussed below, Decree 6875/1971 provides some guidance on the
calculation of economically reasonable airfares (the TER), this is not immediately apparent and its
provisions are not entirely clear. The Tribunal also notes that by 2007, the prevailing conditions
in the domestic air transportation market had changed such that the regulatory and tax regime was
acknowledged to have become antiquated and airfare tariffs had become outdated.*”* In addition,
it appears that by 2008, due to the complexity inherent in the determination of air transportation
costs, the Secretary of Transportation sought external technical assistance to determine the

economically reasonable fares for Argentina’s domestic air transportation market.*”?

525. Turning to Article 42 of Law 19,030, the Tribunal finds that the plain language of the text
provides that airfares shall be set in accordance with, or by way of the concept of, an economically
reasonable tariff (the TER) for each route or route segment. The Tribunal is unable to accept
Respondent’s interpretation that the TER is only one of various interests to be considered pursuant
to Article 42 of Law 19,030. Rather, the plain meaning of Article 42 of Law 19,030 is that airfares
shall be established by way of, or in accordance with, the concept of an economically reasonable
tariff which is required to be set in consideration of the interests of the nation, the users, and the

establish any hierarchy between the various interests to be consulted. While Respondent submitted
that, properly translated, Article 42 of Law 19,030 does not contain the phrase “in accordance

526. This interpretation is consistent with the evidence of Claimants’ legal expert, Dr. Bianchi,

and Respondent’s legal expert, Dr. Mata, in respect of Argentine administrative law relating to

public services, pursuant to which public service tariffs must be “fair and reasonable”.>*?

According to Dr. Mata, the “...tariffs charged must allow the concessionaire, when operating

efficiently, to obtain proceeds in an amount adequate to cover the costs of operations, maintenance

and expansion of services, as well as for a business profit.”°?!

527. In addition, the conduct of the Parties also reflects this interpretation. In this regard, the
General Transfer Contract, Article II(3)(m) contains a guarantee by Government of Argentina that
tariffs for domestic flights would be set according to Articles 42-46 of the Air Business Law.>*?
Further, in the 2006 Agreement, the Parties agreed that the Government of Argentina, through the
exercise of the votes attached to its Class A Shares in ARSA, would have the right to object and
block the elimination or substantial reduction of domestic air transportation services provided that
compliance with the application of the economically reasonable tariff (Article 42, Law 19,030)

was ensured.>*

528. Furthermore, a review of the various decrees and resolutions adopted by the Government
of Argentina, as well as the bills it submitted to Congress, reflect the obligation to set domestic
airfares pursuant to the TER. For example, Decree 1012/2006 expressly provided that the tariff
increases granted to update the tariffs set in Decree 1654/2002 were to be considered “on account
of the economically viable [reasonable] fare determined by Section 42 of Law No. 19,030.”°*4

this, the assistance of a team of experts would be required. See C-856 p. 2.

Finally, the repeated request from the Airlines and from the Airlines Chamber (“CLARA”)

referred to the need for tariff increases in order to achieve an economically reasonable airfare.**°

529. On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the legal regime governing
domestic airfares in Argentina, and specifically Article 42 of Law No. 19,030, provided that
airfares were required to be set in accordance with the concept of economically reasonable airfares.
This concept is consistent with and reflects the Argentine administrative law principle which

requires that public service tariffs shall be “fair and reasonable”.

(ii) The calculation of the TER

assert that TER is “explained” in Decree 6875/1971, which, according to them, implements the

Air Business Law.°>” Claimants refer to Article 3 of Decree 6875/1971, which provides that:

The administrative authority [i.e. the Secretary of Transportation] shall perform the necessary
technical and economic studies to determine the economically reasonable airfare for passengers
[flights] in all the routes and segments of routes, based on the load factor approved by the
administrative authority. The airfare shall cover the direct and indirect exploitation costs for each
route or segment of route, to which an additional amount approved for each company shall be added
to account for financial costs and a margin of return.>

531. According to Claimants, Articles 4 and 5 of the Decree further specify the mechanism by
which the “four items” on which the TER is based are to be calculated. Article 4 describes the
calculation of 1) direct and 2) indirect costs, while Article 5 describes the calculation of 3) financial

costs and 4) the margin of return for the airline.**? Claimants also assert that this decree requires

airlines’ right to a TER (Art. 10). Respondent is also permitted to modify airfares between annual

reviews if certain changes in costs occur (Art. 6).>4°

532. Respondent disagrees with Claimants’ assertion that Decree 6875/1971 applies generally
to airfares on all routes. Instead, Respondent asserts that the Claimants confuse the TER concept
under Article 42 of the Air Business Law with the concept of economic supplementation or
subsidization for unprofitable routes under Article 6 of that same law.**! According to Respondent,
Decree 6875/1971 only regulates the special circumstances of Article 6 and not the general

circumstances of Article 42.>7 As Respondent explains Article 6 and Decree 6875/1971:

[I]n the event that unreasonable airfares are charged for regular air transport services which are of
special interest to the Nation in routes or portions of routes declared to be of general interest, the so-
called economic compensation provided for in Article 6 of Law No. 19,030 applies. For the purpose
of determining whether the economic compensation should be granted, Article 6 provides that the
benefits obtained by domestic carriers in rendering the rest of the regular air transport services
awarded, as a result of charging fares that are higher than the reasonable airfare, will offset the
economic compensation to be granted. Presidential Decree No. 6875/1971 regulates the method for
determining such economic compensation, which is not granted at will, but is subject to the
fulfillment of certain conditionsf.]°*

533. In other words, according to Respondent and its experts, Article 6 is a specialized provision
of the Air Business Law by which the Argentine government will subsidize airlines that fly

unprofitable routes declared to be of special interest to the state, unless the airline is able to offset

airfares are set forth in Resolution 357/78 (1978). (Cl. Mem. 89; C-64) It is unclear, however, how this Resolution
fits with the mechanism described in Decree 6875/1971, or whether the Resolution is still applicable today, 35 years
later (the legal distinction between decrees and resolutions is also not entirely clear). The Resolution notes the
importance of determining fair and equitable fares, as well as having a methodology to reliably calculate airline costs,
and then requires airlines to report their costs using a reporting system. The Resolution requires the Airlines to
temporarily use a different cost reporting system in light of their higher costs, and states that these higher costs will
be factored into their average fares.

mechanism for determining only that subsidy. Respondent argues, moreover, that carriers are not
under a duty to provide services to these unprofitable routes, and they are only entitled to
compensation if they meet the necessary conditions under the terms of Article 6.°*° Respondent
argues that if Claimants considered that the airfares for internal regular air transport services for
passengers on certain routes or route segments were unprofitable, they should have requested a
subsidy according to the established procedures and conditions.*#° Respondent points out that
Claimants did not seek “supplementation” or “subsidization” for specific unprofitable routes, nor

did they ever refer to Article 6 or Decree 6875/1971 in their requests for airfare increases.*“”

acknowledge that “Decree No. 6875/1971 implements the economical compensation mechanism
set forth in Article 6 of the Air Business Law” and that Article 6 of the ABL provides for
compensation “in cases where [the Airlines] sustain losses caused by uneconomical or unprofitable

by the Government to be of ‘special interest to the nation[.]’”>*8 Claimants then argue that

[The effect of Article 6 and Decree No. 6875/1971 as part of the regulatory framework applicable
to airfares is twofold: i) these instruments confirm that the right to Economically Reasonable
Airfares [ERA] is an overarching right applicable to all routes flown by air carriers, ie., the
economic compensation mechanism derives from the application of the right set forth in article 42
of the Air Business Law [ABL]; further, ii) Decree No. 6875/1971 explains in detail the
methodology according to which the regulator must set airfares for them to comply with the [ERA]
standard, i.e., it spells out the scope of the right to [ERA] by providing that airfares must cover costs
and allow for a fair margin of return in order to meet the legal standard.
535. The heading and preambular language of Decree 6875/1971 indicate that the decree
specifically regulates Article 6’s routes of “special interest” and the provision of subsidies when
these routes incur losses:

Section 6 of the Commercial Air Transportation Policy Law No. 19,030 determines the basic
conditions for the Executive Branch’s economic subsidies to domestic air carriers.

The system to be implemented by this regulation should refer to scheduled air services meeting the
public interest requirement set forth in Section 6 of Law No. 19,030.

Considering that its aim is to offset operating losses resulting from air fares approved by the
Executive Branch for social or political interests at stake, or from insufficient traffic potential, the
economic subsidy system should be timely applied and cover all aspects to ensure the day-to-day
operations of the public service concession holders.»

536. Title II of the Decree, to which Claimants primarily refer, is entitled, in translation:
“Method to Determine the Subsidy for Companies Providing Scheduled Passenger Services.” The
word “subsidy” (Respondent translates this as “supplementation,” and the term in the original
Spanish is complementacion econémica) invokes the idea of compensation. However, the language
of Article 3, within Title II, does appear to refer to all routes, and not only those that are
unprofitable or of “special interest” and that therefore require subsidization or supplementation:
Article 3 — The administrative authority [i-e. the Secretary of Transportation] shall perform the
necessary technical and economic studies to determine the economically reasonable airfare for

passengers [flights] in all the routes and segments of routes, based on the load factor approved by
the administrative authority. [emphasis added]

537. Articles 4 and 5 describe the costs and profitability measurements that are to be considered

in determining the TER. Article 6 indicates when the Secretary of Transportation may review the

TER during the fiscal year. Only in Article 7 is specific reference made to unprofitable routes:
“The State shall grant subsidies (complementacién econémica) to offset the economic losses of
public service concession holders arising from fixed fares lower than the economically [reasonable
airfare] (tarifa econémica retributiva) for the services set out in Title I hereof.” Article 7 therefore
indicates that in the event that the fixed fare for a given route is set lower than the TER that has

been normally calculated for that route, subsidies or compensation may be granted to the airline.

538. The Tribunal notes that while Respondent and its expert, Professor Donato, have asserted
that a company seeking a subsidy under Decree 6875 must request it after meeting the specified
conditions, Decree 6875 seems to call for a slightly different procedure. In Title III of Decree 6875,

Rules for Granting an Economic Subsidy, Article 10 provides that:

Before December | of each year the State shall review the fare structure to become effective the
following year, taking into account any proposals made by the companies providing the services,
which should aim towards becoming self-sufficient. Thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of
each period of operation, the administrative authority shall determine the services per routes or route
segments for which, in view of the public interest, it is advisable to set a fare lower than the
economically reasonable airfare. The companies shall be notified, on the same date, of the aggregate
preventive subsidy that will be granted to each of them upon application of the method described
under Title II. They may file their comments within the following fifteen (15) days, and the
administrative authority shall issue a final decision.

 

539. The Tribunal’s review of the relevant provisions of the Air Business Law and
Decree 6875/1971 together with the evidence of the Parties’ legal experts indicates that the TER
is the fundamental principle applicable to all domestic air routes and is the standard against which
Decree 6875/1971 determines whether subsidies or supplementation of airfares declared to be of
special interest to the Government of Argentina is warranted. In order to achieve this,
Decree 6875/1971 sets out the components of the economically reasonable tariff and provides

direction on how those components should be calculated.

540. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Air Business Law, the Government of Argentina is required to
subsidize or compensate carriers rendering regular domestic transportation services for losses
caused by the application of airfares which are not economically reasonable (tarifas no
retributivas) or below the TER standard and which have been declared to be of special interest to

the Government of Argentina. Decree 6875/1971 implements Article 6 of the Air Business Law

181

Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.
v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1)

 

Award

and sets out the mechanism for doing so, including the determination of the economically
reasonable tariff against which the non-economically reasonable airfare (tarifas no
retributivas/tarifas fijadas, que sean inferiores a la tarifa econémica retributiva) are measured in
order to determine the subsidy or supplementary compensation due (Art. 6 of the Air Business
Law and Art. 7 of Decree 6875/1971). As noted above, Article 3 of the Decree provides that the
regulatory authority (the Secretariat of Transportation) is directed to undertake the necessary
technical and economic studies to determine the TER for passengers [flights] for all routes and
route segments. This direction is not specifically directed to non-economical routes of special
interest to the Government of Argentina, but appears to apply generally to all routes and route
segments. This appears logical since without determining the TER for a given route, it would
appear difficult to determine whether the fare for that route was lower than (inferior) to the TER.>*!
Article 3 then goes on to provide that the said airfare (the TER) (Dicha tarifa) shall cover the
indirect and direct costs of operating the routes or route segments and add an amount for financial

costs and an approved margin of return for each operator.

541. Articles 4 and 5 of the Decree describe how the direct and indirect costs of operation are
to be determined, notably providing that direct costs shall be calculated based on the necessary
inputs (fuel, lubricant, air personnel, maintenance, insurance and devaluation) for the correct and
efficient operation of the services. The Tribunal notes that this is consistent with Dr. Mata’s
evidence on the nature of the TER when he states that the airfare “must allow the concessionaire,
when operating efficiently, to obtain proceeds in an amount adequate to cover the costs of

operation, maintenance and expansion of services, as well as allow for a business profit.”°>

542. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that while Decree 6875/1971 addressed and
implemented the specific regime created by Article 6 of the Air Business Law relating to subsidies
for losses incurred by the application of non-economically reasonable airfares on routes declared

of special interest to the Government of Argentina, it also sets out the components of the TER and

551 KPMG’s review of the regulatory framework and Decree 6875/1971 is consistent with this. See KPMG ERI {|
11.2.9.

952 Mata ER3 J 33. This is consistent with the Argentine jurisprudence on the principle of “just and reasonable tariffs”
in the case of public service concessions. In this regard, see Cl. CC. Rej. {| 46-47, 58 and the sources cited there.

how it should be calculated. It also required the Secretariat of Transportation to conduct the
necessary technical and economic studies to determine the TER for all routes and route segments.
This is consistent with the Tribunal’s conclusion set out above that under the regulatory framework

governing domestic airfares, the TER applies to all domestic routes.

543. The Tribunal’s review of the evidence indicates that the Secretariat of Transportation did
conduct a number of studies of airfares during the period from 2001 to 2008, often in response to
requests from the Airlines for fare increases and other relief. These will be addressed separately,
below. However, there was no evidence that the Secretariat of Transportation, or other
governmental agencies, determined the TER for each domestic route or route segment on an annual
or regular basis. Further, there was no evidence regarding whether such reviews were carried on

at any time prior to 2001.

544. In addition, as previously noted, no specific declaration that particular routes were of
“special interest to the Nation” was made by the Secretariat of Transportation. Further, although
the Airlines made repeated requests for increases in the airfares and other forms of relief, there
was no evidence that the Airlines, Interinvest or Claimants ever made an application for the
granting of subsidies or supplementary compensation pursuant to Article 6 of the Air Business

Law and Decree 6875/1971.

Airfare bands

545. An additional component of Claimants’ arguments on the alleged airfare squeeze is that
the airfare band permitted by Argentine regulations during 2001 - 2008 was too narrow, preventing
Claimants from implementing an effective yield management strategy. According to Claimants,
the airfare band system was implemented in Resolution 275/87, providing a “base” or reference
airfare and permitting a ceiling above and a floor below this base by a fixed percentage.>”?
Claimants maintain that while the airfare bands did not permit fully open competition, these
measures were designed to permit some degree of competition and to increase management’s
ability to make short-term and long-term strategic decisions for the companies.>*

546. Claimants claim that as a consequence of the continuous increases in costs between 2001
and 2008 and the economically unreasonable or insufficient airfares, the airfare bands were
effectively narrowed and the Airlines were unable to use the airfare bands to implement standard
price differentiation and yield management techniques.*°> Claimants also say that in 2012 the

airfare bands were expanded back to pre-2002 levels.**°

547. Respondent does not appear to oppose Claimants’ description of the regulatory framework
for airfare bands. However, Respondent says that the airfare band system existed well before 2001
and continued to apply beyond the period of 2001 to 2008.°*’ Further, Respondent says that the
existence of the airfare band system did not grant operators the right to demand a certain band
width; instead this was within the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation.*** In addition,
Respondent says that the airfare band width ratio remained practically the same from the end of
2001 and denies that the band width was expanded after the expropriation of the Airlines.>°?
According to Respondent, the airfare bands established under the regulatory framework allowed
the implementation of yield management strategies in order to obtain the greatest value for each
seat. However, according to Respondent, the Airlines failed to implement a proper yield
management strategy and to take advantage of improvement opportunities due to bad revenue
management.*°

airfare bands of a 20% variation were subsequently increased to 60%, briefly reduced to 35% and

maximum airfare for flights booked less than 10 days before departure. As a result, the Tribunal
understands Claimants’ complaint to be based primarily on the lack of an appropriate benchmark

or reference tariff (tarifa de referencia) rather than a narrowing of the airfare bands as such.

Cc. Did the airfares set between 2001 and 2008 comply with the TER standard?

549. Claimants assert that Respondent failed to set airfares in compliance with the TER
standard, in violation of the FET provision of the Treaty.*°? Claimants further request a finding
that in the May 29, 2008 Board of Directors Meeting, the Government of Argentina expressly
acknowledged that domestic airfares were uneconomically low, giving rise to losses to the Airlines

within a range of USD 390-450 million.*

in compliance with the regulatory framework and fair and reasonable. It says the airfare squeeze
alleged was legally and practically impossible and, in any event, there was no airfare squeeze.>™

552. Claimants argue that in the face of substantial cost increases between October 2001 and

increases,” the last two only weeks before the State took control of the Airlines.*°° According to
Claimants, none of these four increases complied with the TER standard. Claimants assert that
these numerous requests to increase fares, which they made both on their own and as part of the
Argentine airline industry, demonstrate that the fares were set below the TER standard and
impeded the Airlines’ ability to cover costs and obtain a fair margin of return.**” Claimants’ expert,
Compass Lexecon, says that the fare increases were “arbitrary in light of the regulatory framework,

as none of these increases were based on an estimate of the TER.”°°

553. Claimants also assert that Respondent recognized the insufficiency of the fare increases by
“commit[ing] in the same decree or resolution to grant tax benefits, insurance cost relief and fuel
subsidies to alleviate the burden on the Argentine Airlines caused by the insufficient approved

airfare.”*° Moreover, Argentina failed to implement the promised tax relief.*”°

554. For its part, Respondent argues that it never changed the regulatory system applicable to
airfares during Claimants’ tenure; the same regulations applied as before Claimants took control
of the Airlines.*”! Respondent asserts that the Government of Argentina was highly responsive to
the problems within the airline industry between 2001-2008, granting four airfare increases
between 2001 and 2008 that raised reference fares by 67% and cap fares by 135%.” It notes that
it provided other forms of relief to airlines, including exemptions from taking out insurance within

the country and establishing a fuel subsidy.>”?

555. Respondent furthermore notes that there was no requirement that the Airlines provide
services on certain routes if they were deemed too unprofitable, and that carriers had the right to
request suspension or interruption of the service if they considered that the rate was not
profitable.>”* Respondent asserts that Claimants never invoked Article 6 of the Air Business Law
or Decree 6875 during their control of the Airlines, nor did they apply for a subsidy under these

regulations.*”°

556. Finally, with respect to the tax exemption measures allegedly promised but not delivered
by the Government of Argentina, Respondent asserts that it was under no legal obligation to
provide these measures, that the recommendations contained in the decrees did not constitute
binding promises, and that the Executive did not have any authority to enact the tax relief measures

envisioned in the decrees, which had to be granted by Congress.°”°

2002: Declaration of State of Emergency for Commercial Air Transport

557. Claimants note that soon after they began managing the Airlines in late 2001, the
Government of Argentina declared a state of public emergency in the social, economic,
administrative, financial and exchange areas.”7On January 9, 2002, the Government devalued the
peso to a fixed rate of ARS 1.40 per USD 1.00. A month later it established a floating exchange

rate, and the value of the peso immediately fell on the open market.>”*

558. On September 4, 2002, Decree 1654/02 Declaring a State of Emergency for Commercial
Air Transport provided for the first airfare increase.*”? In that decree, the Government of Argentina
described the following:

The costs of the commercial air transport sector include a high percentage of imported inputs; also,
the cost of domestic inputs, such as fuel, has also increased.

 

Specifically, the causes of the deep-rooted crisis of this sector are, among others, the tight credit that
prevents airlines from securing financing, the increase in the price of the type of fuel used, the higher

insurance costs, and the direct incidence that exchange rate fluctuations have on the air transport
sector. Therefore, it is necessary to expressly declare the emergency of the air transport sector within
the framework of Law No. 25,561, to adopt the policies designed to offset existing imbalances that
airlines need to continue operating, and, as a result, providing services to users and preserving jobs.

Excessive supply in a market depressed by recession, on the one hand, and prices misaligned with
the operational costs of companies, on the other, may give rise to market predatory practices likely
to lead to an absurd price-based competition, which in turn may prevent a business from operating
safely and profitably, during a reasonable period of time. As a consequence of the above, it is
advisable to adjust the current airfare benchmark and price ranges used to determine the prices
charged to the public by operators of scheduled domestic air transport for their services, in order to
make them consistent with the current costs of the industry.

559. According to Respondent, the measures contained in this Decree had been requested by
another domestic airline, Dinar, which had requested an average increase of 73% on the maximum
fares.>®° Respondent notes that ARSA had proposed only smaller increases averaging 34.5%, and
that ARSA had critiqued Dinar’s request, “alleging that such request was not financially viable,
and that for increases on current levels to be accepted by users, gradual amendments had to be
considered.”**! According to Respondent, the Government of Argentina ultimately granted an

increase of 41% in maximum airfares, and of 45% in minimum airfares.°°”

560. Claimants dispute the quantification of the increase on maximum airfares, and peg it
instead at a “very modest” 20% increase.**? Claimants assert that this increase was “not nearly
sufficient, however, to account for the continuous drop in the US$ value of the domestic airfares,
coupled with the steep increase in the Argentine Airlines’ cost structure, which was mostly set in
US dollars.”**+ Moreover, they argue that according to Argentina’s own “cost index,” the Decree
should have raised airfares by 88%.°*° They do not directly respond to Respondent’s contention

that ARSA requested only a 34.5% increase at the time.

determining the next fare increase in August 2006 that followed the February 2006 Report).

561. In addition to its provisions on airfares, the 2002 Decree also included provisions for the
preparation of a bill proposing measures to cut the value-added tax for fuel by 50%, create a VAT
exemption for aircraft leased with a purchase option, to permit airlines to use VAT surpluses to
pay any other taxes and Social Security obligations, and create a VAT exemption for insurance
policies purchased outside Argentina. The Parties appear to agree that these tax provisions were

never implemented; their arguments regarding these provisions are addressed below.

2004: Claimants’ requests denied

562. Respondent points out, and Claimants do not refute, that Claimants did not request an
additional airfare increase until 2004, two years later.>*° In October 2004, Claimants wrote to the
Office of Transportation requesting a rise in the reference or cap rate of 8% to account for the
increase in the price of fuel.**’ This request was rejected in December 2004 on the basis of two
Technical Reports (one for each airline) dated October 28, 2004, that were issued by the office of

Undersecretary Cirielli.>**

563. Claimants concede that neither the reports nor the rejection letters disputed the Airlines’
right to a TER. They argue, however, that Argentina wrongly focused on the Airlines’ increased
revenues in 2003 rather than their increased costs. Claimants argue that this focus was wrong

because “costs to be taken into account for the purpose of setting the airfares are beyond the

  

airlines’ control, whereas the revenues are at least partially a function of the efficient management
of the company,” and that considering revenues would “indirectly punish efficient management of
airlines and reward or subsidize inefficient management practices.”>*? Claimants argue that such
an analysis is “in clear contravention of the regulatory framework in place.”**° According to
Claimants, Respondent is required to set airfares taking into account the four factors listed in
Decree 6875/1971: i) direct costs, ii) indirect costs, iii) financial costs and iv) a margin of return.>*!

They argue that “[t]he ability of air carriers to make a reasonable margin of return is one of the

objectives of the regulatory framework[.]”°*? Claimants also argue that it was a mistake for
Respondent to focus only on the period preceding the request, rather than trending current and

future increases in fuel prices.°*

564. According to Respondent, the Reports concluded that both Airlines had been obtaining
positive gross margins with an increasing trend and that they had even begun to monopolize certain
routes. The Reports also found that the cost increases did not affect the financial equation of the

companies, which had larger positive margins on the domestic market.***

565. Respondent notes that the Secretary of Transportation prepared two new technical reports,
one for each airline, in March 2005 in response to a motion for reconsideration that had been filed
by Claimants. These reports concluded that the Airlines had achieved a major recovery in operating

profitability.°°

2005-2006: Strikes, Government pressure, the June 2006 Agreement and a fare increase

566. According to Claimants, two labor unions of the Airlines held a major strike at the end of
November 2005. According to Mr. Diaz Ferran, this strike that lasted nine days, “almost
completely shut down the Argentine Airlines,” and further destabilized the already precarious
financial position of the Airlines.>” In this context, say Claimants, the Airlines met in December
2005 with President Nestor Kirchner, Secretary of Transportation Ricardo Jaime and the
President’s Chief of Staff to again request an increase in fares.°°’ According to Mr. Diaz Ferran,
the Chief of Staff promised an increase in fares in the first quarter of 2006.*°° By March 2006, the

fares had not increased. Around this same time, according to Claimants, one Argentine publication

reported on the government’s “secret plan” to get a hold of the Airlines, and asserted that the
599

government was delaying fare increases in order to further pressure Claimants.
567. Claimants assert that they held additional meetings with President Kirchner in May 2006
and were again promised that the fares would be increased. They allege that this time President
Kirchner’s promise was conditioned upon the Airlines’ conclusion of an agreement with the unions
for a 25% salary increase.! Around this same time, Secretary of Transportation Jaime separately
indicated that Argentina would only increase fares (and also withdraw its challenges to the
Airlines’ financial statements) if the government could increase its shareholding and control in

ARSA.°

568. The June 2006 Agreement between the Airlines, Interinvest and the Government of
Argentina will be discussed further in Section VIII D.4., below. For present purposes, it suffices
to note that Claimants consider the “core” of their negotiations on this agreement to concern an

increase in airfares in exchange for increased Government of Argentina participation and

603

withdrawal of judicial proceedings against ARSA’s financial statements. In response,

Respondent argues that neither the June 2006 Agreement nor its addendum contained any
stipulation regarding a commitment of airfare increases. A review of the text of the Agreement

and Addendum reveals that neither document addresses airfares or the TER.

569. In August 2006, Respondent issued Decree 1012/2006,°° which permitted an increase in

airfares of 20%.” The decree also included a fuel cost subsidy and directed the preparation of

legislative bills granting VAT exemptions similar to those that had been included in the 2002
Decree. Claimants argue that this 20% increase was insufficient in light of the spike in costs
since the 2002 Decree, and say that Argentina once again failed to implement the VAT

exemptions.%”

570. Claimants refer to a technical report dated February 16, 2006, which they say was the basis
for the August 2006 increase, and which they say “strongly recommended an airfare increase on
the exact same basis that had been alleged by the Argentine Airlines in 2004 and 2005.”°!°
However, Claimants argue that the 20% increase granted in the August 2006 decree was “facially
insufficient, even according to the GOA’s analysis conducted in the February 2006 Report.”°!!
Specifically, Claimants argue that in the February 2006 Report, the Government of Argentina
determined that since the 2002 fare increase, fuel costs alone had increased 97%, and that salaries

had increased 57%, other costs aside. Nonetheless, Decree 1012/2006 granted only a much more

modest 20% increase in airfare caps.°!?

571. Respondent, for its part, does not reference the February 16, 2006 report but instead
references a March 16, 2006 “Technical report on preliminary assessments of amounts to be
reimbursed for commercial domestic air routes,” that served as the basis for Decree 1012/2006.
The contents of this report are different from the February 16, 2006 report cited by Claimants,

although the report is authored by the same individual who authored the February report.°?

2007-2008: Additional collective and individual requests for fare increases

572. On three separate occasions in 2007, CLARA, the association of major airlines operating

requested a rise of 40% in air fares as well as the implementation of the tax measures provided for
in the 2006 Decree. According to Claimants, Argentina ignored each of CLARA’s requests.®!°
Respondent argues that CLARA’s requests were granted by two resolutions that were issued in

April and May 2008.°!7

573. In March and April 2008, the Airlines sent two urgent requests for swift action to raise
airfares, emphasizing their shortfall and asserting that the lack of action would have “an immediate
impact” including suspended flights and payment problems.®'* Claimants point in particular to the
April 29, 2008 letter, in which they identified losses of USD 100 million suffered in the first quarter
of 2008 due to the below-TER airfares. Claimants also noted in this letter that “[i]f the provisions
of Executive Order 1012/2006 had been applied since it was issued, that is to say, since September
2006 through April 2008, the relevant figures would range between USD 390,000,000 and USD
450,000,000.” They say that at the May 29, 2008 meeting of ARSA’s Board of Directors, the
Government of Argentina’s representatives confirmed the accuracy of the facts described and

damages detailed in the April 29, 2008 letter, and stated that “the National State is aware of this

situation.”°!

574. Around this same time, in March 2008, a report assessing airfares was prepared for the
Secretary of Transportation.” This report was prepared at the request of the Secretary of
Transportation in order to provide information in relation to a possible increase in domestic

airfares. It reviews the cost increases of the Airlines between August 2006 and December 2007

floor and stated that, because the letter was sent to the Secretary of Transportation on April 29, it
can be said that the measures that were therein requested were being gradually implemented, given
the synergy between their issue and implementation. They further stated that the Federal
Government was aware of the situation and that the ratification took place after the letter had been
sent, as a result of which, in their capacity as Directors appointed by the Federal Government, not
only were they not unaware of the factual situation but they knew that efforts were being made in
that regard.

and notes that it does not estimate the economic retributive tariff [TER] “corresponding to each
route and route segment, as provided in Article 42 of the Law No. 19,030 [Air Business Law],
since that requires the assistance of a team of experts that defines the model air carrier for the
domestic market.”°?!

575. In April and May 2008, the Argentine government granted two increases, each providing

for an increase in fares of approximately 18%, by means of two Resolutions.

576. Claimants note that the Government of Argentina stated that it granted both of these airfare
increases “on account...[and] as a result of bring[ing airfares] in line with the provisions of Law
19,030 [Air Business Law], Section 42.6% According to Claimants, “[t]his constitutes a
recognition that, up to that date, airfares did not comply with the TER.” In any case, Claimants
argue that these two increases had “no impact whatsoever on the Argentine Airlines’ operations
simply because the GOA took full control of the Argentine Airlines in July 2008.”°° Claimants
also argue that the Government of Argentina acknowledged that the April 2008 increase was below

the Economically Reasonable Airfare.°*°

577. Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the parties agreed to the second 18% increase
as part of the May 15, 2008 Master Agreement signed between Argentina and Air
Comet/Interinvest, which was then effectively granted by Resolution ST No. 315/2008. Argentina

granted by the Argentine Republic.”°”

Fare increases subsequent to re-nationalization

578. Claimants note that following Respondent’s expropriation of the Airlines, Respondent
increased airfares at least eight times: in November 2009, June 2010, March 2011, May 2011,
February 2012, June 2012, November 2012 and May 2013.°* According to Claimants’ expert,
Compass Lexecon, “[a]lthough the cost of jet fuel in 2013 is approximately the same as it was in
2008, statutory airfare levels doubled since expropriation. In fact, the only cost component that
increased since expropriation seems to have been local salaries, which according to the Secretariat

of Transportation represented only 18% of the airlines’ cost structure in 2008.”°°

commitments.*? Respondent does not deny that certain measures, which depended on the adoption

fuel subsidies, were implemented.

“promised” benefits, “Argentina cannot escape its international obligations by invoking domestic

rules governing the allocation of powers between its several sovereign branches.”®*? Claimants
also argue that these measures, which were promised in addition to the fare increases, constitute
“recognition by the GOA that tax benefits were needed [and] demonstrate[] that the approved
airfares were not Economically Reasonable Airfares even at that time. In other words, had the
approved airfare increase been sufficient for the Argentine Airlines to cover their direct and
indirect costs and obtain a reasonable margin of return, why would the GOA commit to grant tax

exemptions?”°**

583. Respondent argues that it never ‘promised’ or undertook to grant tax benefits, and that the
decrees “only included internal instructions issued by the Argentine Executive for the draft of bills
contemplating certain tax benefits. Under no circumstances did these instructions constitute
binding promises.”**> Argentina notes that several other bills were also proposed concerning the
tax benefits mentioned in those decrees.°°° Respondent argues that as the decrees themselves
indicate, changes on tax matters must be made by Congress, and the executive branch lacks the
powers to enact them.**” Finally, Respondent notes that it provided other benefits, including an
exemption from the obligation to take out insurance in the country®* and an Aviation Fuel Subsidy
Scheme (RCCA) established in 1012/2006 Decree, which led to disbursements in the form of
subsidies between August 2006 and February 2008, 95% of which went to the Airlines.°?

584. The language of the Decrees as it relates to the tax measures is indeed precatory. In this
regard, the 2006 Decree states “[i]t is, therefore, recommended,” “[i]t is also considered advisable
to authorize,” “[t]he impact of aviation fuel on the companies’ cost structure and the increases in
costs make it advisable to apply a differential tax treatment[.]”™° The 2006 Decree also notes that

instructed to submit to the Office of the Head of the Cabinet of Argentina within thirty (30) days
a bill proposing the approval of such measures, for the Head of the Cabinet to coordinate the action
to be implemented as from the issue of this Decree.”*! As a result, the provisions relating to the
preparation of bills regarding tax measures do not amount to a commitment by the Government to
implement such measures. However, the repeated measures proposed in addition to airfare
increases do reflect that the airfare increases granted were not sufficient, on their own, to permit

the Airlines to cover their costs and earn a reasonable margin.

match increases in the Airlines’ costs. This is usefully demonstrated by Claimants’ experts,

the increase in the Airlines’ costs during that period whereas tariff increases granted from 2009 to 2013 covered and
eventually exceeded the increase in the Airlines’ costs for that period.

586. According to Claimants’ experts, over the period between 2001 through to April 2008,
costs increased by 182%, but maximum airfares increased by only 43%, when measured in ARS.
When measured in USD, the Airlines’ costs fell by only 10.9% while airfares decreased by
36.9%. The Tribunal finds this evidence persuasive and is unable to accept Respondent’s

position that airfare increases exceeded, let alone covered, the costs of the Airlines during the

period in question.°*

April and May 2008 increases are included in the comparison, airfares increased by 100% by the time of expropriation.
Claimants say that the increases which took place in April and May 2008 came too late to be of assistance to the
Airlines before the July 2008 Agreement.

4 Tn this regard, the Tribunal accepts the position of Claimants’ experts that Respondent’s analysis is flawed for a
number of reasons, notably by estimating the increase in maximum airfares in ARS while representing the evolution
of the Airlines’ domestic costs in USD. Claimants’ experts note that over the relevant period, the ARS depreciated
by approximately 216%. See also Compass Lexecon’s critique at CLEX ER3 {f 36-47.

587. Further, several of the decrees and resolutions adopted by the Government of Argentina
and the Secretary of Transportation reflected an awareness that airfares needed to be increased in
order to cover the Airlines’ increasing costs and to meet the TER standard, particularly from 2005
forward. A number of these are referred to above in Section V.“> Further, the provisions in the
relevant decrees requesting the preparation of bills on tax matters for submission to Congress
reflects the need to adopt measures in addition to airfare increases in order to cover the increasing

costs of the industry.°*°

588. Finally, the Tribunal notes the repeated requests by both the Airlines and CLARA,
including its member LAN Argentina, for airfare increases, commencing soon after the airfare
increase provided for in Decree 1012/2006 through mid-July 2008. These demonstrate that all of
the operators in the air transport industry requested airfare increases and other measures in order
to cover their costs and obtain a fair margin of return.’ In this regard, the Tribunal notes in
particular the Airlines’ letter of April 29, 2008 to the Secretary of Transportation urging the
adoption of airfare increases and other measures and detailing the lost revenue alleged to have
flowed from the failure to grant adequate increases and to adopt other proposed measures (C-79).
The minutes of the ARSA Board meeting of May 29, 2008 indicate that the government
representatives on the Board were aware of the dire economic circumstances of ARSA and

approved the text of the letter of April 29, 2008.°*

589. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the domestic airfares regulated by the

Secretary of Transportation did not permit airlines operating in the domestic passenger

transportation sector to cover their costs and earn a reasonable margin of return. The Tribunal now

turns to the question of what effect this had on the Airlines.

590. Respondent raised a number of arguments to the effect that the airfares in place during
Claimants’ ownership of the Airlines between 2001 and 2008 were reasonable and did not
detrimentally affect the Airlines. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal is not persuaded by

these arguments.

591. First, Respondent argues that the Airlines’ domestic operations, which were the only ones
covered by the airfare regime, were healthy and yielded positive results in the period between 2001
and 2008. According to Respondent, the true cause for the Airlines’ losses was their international
operations.“ Claimants say that the analysis conducted by Respondent and its experts is flawed
for a number of reasons including analyzing the costs and revenues of the two Airlines on a
combined basis and over estimating the relevance of international operations thereby over-
allocating estimated costs and losses to the international operations.®° As a result, Claimants say
that Respondent and its experts are wrong in maintaining that the Airlines’ domestic operations
cross-subsidized international operations and that their experts significantly inflated losses

incurred by the international operations.

592. The Tribunal’s review of the detailed expert reports and the relevant evidence leads it to
prefer Claimants’ position and the evidence of its experts. In the Tribunal’s view, in examining
these questions it is important to distinguish between the data for ARSA and AUSA and analyze
their data separately, particularly in light of the fact that AUSA operated almost exclusively
domestic routes and that domestic revenues represented approximately 98% of its total revenues.
Further, the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’ argument that Respondent’s experts, KPMG, did
not adequately allocate certain categories of costs and/or revenues to domestic operations but,

rather, allocated them entirely to international operations.*! The Tribunal agrees that this affects

a fundamental element of Respondent’s experts’ analysis and renders it unreliable.°? As a result,
the Tribunal finds Claimants’ expert’s analysis more persuasive and accepts it. In this regard, the
Tribunal accepts that AUSA’s costs consistently exceeded revenues for all years in question except
2003 and 2004.%° As a result, the Tribunal concludes that, insofar as AUSA is concerned,
domestic revenues did not exceed domestic costs and it does not appear that domestic operations

cross-subsidized international operations (which were minimal for AUSA).

593. In respect of ARSA’s costs and revenues, it appears that neither ARSA’s financial
statements nor the financial data used by Respondent and its experts permit the reliable allocation
of certain categories of revenues and costs between domestic and international operations. In these
circumstances, it appears that Respondent’s expert, KPMG, allocated all of these “unassigned”
categories of revenues and costs to the international segment of ARSA’s business.** On the other
hand, Claimants’ expert, CLEX, maintained that a number of costs and revenues were tagged or
identified with the destination of flights and, therefore, could be allocated to either domestic or
international segments of ARSA’s business. It goes on to note that other categories of revenues
and costs are more difficult to allocate and concludes that it would be reasonable to infer that
ARSA’s profitability in the domestic market “cannot be too dissimilar from what we observe in
the case of [AUSA], given the similarities between [ARSA/AUSA]’s domestic operations.” From
this, Claimants’ experts conclude that KPMG’s opinion that the domestic segment of ARSA’s

business cross-subsidized international operations was unsupported and inaccurate.°>

 

652 C]. PHB J 62. Claimants give three examples of why the improper allocation of the entirety of three categories of.
costs/revenues to international operations (“‘contracts”; “non-commercial” and “unassigned”) leads to unreliable
results. The Tribunal finds each of these persuasive. It also notes that these examples highlight the importance of
analyzing ARSA and AUSA’s costs and revenues separately. In this regard, the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s
reasoning that domestic airfares accounted for only 30% of the Airlines’ revenues both irrelevant and misleading.
Since AUSA’s domestic revenues represented 98% of its total revenues, the statement that only 30% of revenues for
both Airlines combined does not apply to AUSA and is irrelevant. In so far as ARSA is concerned, the statement is
inaccurate and irrelevant.

653 Cl, PHB 4 67; CLEX ER3 {| 44-45. The Tribunal notes that according to CLEX, the positive difference between
AUSA’s revenues and costs in USD for 2003 and 2004 is not a direct consequence of adequate level of airfares.
Rather, they say that the reason for the positive difference is that AUSA’s load factors from the very low levels of
2001 (58%) increased to the more reasonable levels in 2003 and 2004 (76% and 79%, respectively).

654 CLEX ER3 147.

655 CLEX ER3 [ 47; Cl. PHB {J 70-71. In the circumstances, Claimants argue that AUSA’s financial information is
the best proxy available to analyze ARSA’s domestic operations in this respect.

594. Inthe Tribunal’s view, Claimants’ expert’s evidence is persuasive and their suggestion that
AUSA’s financial information relating to the profitability (unprofitability) of its domestic
operations serves as a reasonable proxy for ARSA’s domestic operations is reasonable. As a result,
the Tribunal is unable to accept Respondent’s argument that the Airlines’ domestic operations
yielded positive results for the period between 2001 and 2008 or that the cause of losses on
domestic operations was ARSA’s international operations which were subsidized by the Airlines’

domestic operations.

595. Respondent also argued that domestic airfares were not uneconomically low because the
Airlines did not charge the maximum airfares but, rather, charged airfares which were, on average,
14% below the maximum airfare.©° Claimants say that the fact that not all passengers paid the
maximum airfare does not prove that airfares were set at adequate levels in compliance with the
TER. Claimants maintain that the fact that airfares charged were, on average, only 14% below the

maximum cap, demonstrates the opposite of what Respondent argues.°”

596. In the Tribunal’s view, Claimants’ position is correct. Claimants’ experts demonstrated by
way of a mathematical exercise that if the average airfare was 14% below the maximum cap, then
the proportion of travelers purchasing flights at the maximum fare was 70%.°°* According to
Claimants’ experts, the ratio of 70% (or 75%) is significantly above what could be considered a
typical proportion of passengers with a high willingness to purchase a ticket at the highest
unrestricted fare. They contrasted the high ratio of passengers in Argentina paying the maximum
fare to the ratio of 15% in Peru and Chile.®° While the Tribunal accepts that the airfare regimes
in Peru and Chile were different during the relevant period, the comparison is instructive. Further,
the Tribunal accepts Claimants’ experts’ evidence that a low maximum airfare will prevent an

airline from collecting a much higher airfare from those passengers who are prepared to pay a

Claimants’ experts calculated that 70% of all passengers would have had to pay the maximum fare in order to achieve
an average fare of 14% below that cap. Claimants’ experts compared this figure with the figure of 75% provided by
the Argentine Chamber of Commerce in a 2010 study: see CLEX ER Supp. {{ 37 and the source cited at footnote 46

much higher airfare for the convenience of traveling at short notice. As a result, the Tribunal
cannot accept Respondent’s argument that since average domestic airfares were approximately

14% below the maximum cap, airfares were not uneconomically low.

597. Respondent also argued that since business class airfares were not covered by the domestic
airfare regime, the Airlines could have converted their economy class seats into business seats to
maximize revenue, thereby avoiding any constricting effect of maximum economy class fares. For
the reasons set out above at paragraphs 505-513 the Tribunal has found that this was not a realistic
possibility since business class or premium class seats were included within the airfare regime and
maximum airfare caps until the adoption of ST Resolution No. 257/2008.%! As a result, there is
no basis to argue that the Airlines could have created a business class with disproportionately
higher airfares prior to April 2008 and thereby maximized revenues to offset the effects of the

maximum airfare caps.

598. Finally, the Tribunal has considered Respondent’s arguments relating to the efficiency and
profitability of the Airlines’ competitor, LAN, as compared to those of the Airlines in order to
demonstrate that in the case of an efficient operator the airfares were adequate and permitted a

reasonable margin of return.°?

In response to this argument, Claimants say that LAN Argentina
was not more efficient than the Airlines and that its net income and operating margins were
negative for the years 2005 to 2007. They also say that it was only in 2008 that LAN’s net income
became positive. Claimants note that 2008 was an exceptional year for the Airlines and that they
were only under the Claimants’ control for part of that year. Claimants say that AUSA’s financial
performance was, on average, substantially better than that of LAN for the years 2005 through
2008 (even including all of 2008). Relying on their experts, Compass Lexecon and Mr. Ricover,

Claimants also maintain that LAN’s business model was different from that of the Airlines in that

LAN was able to select the densest and most profitable routes to serve.

6 Transcript pp. 1280-1281; CLEX Presentation Slide 11.

66! Further, to the extent that an informal practice permitting the conversion of economy class seats into business class
seats existed, the evidence indicates that it was revenue neutral. Further, there was no indication that this was a wide
spread or that it represented a material portion of the Airlines’ domestic seats or revenues. Further, in the context in
which all air carriers in Argentina had repeatedly requested airfare increases, it seems highly unlikely that they would
have had available the option of creating full business class seats in order to avoid the maximum airfares.

599. In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent has not demonstrated that LAN Argentina was more
efficient than the Airlines nor that it was able to operate more efficiently than the Airlines. In this
regard, the Tribunal believes that the proper comparison is between LAN Argentina and AUSA,
both of which operated almost exclusively domestically. The evidence indicates that from 2005
to 2007, LAN Argentina had negative income and negative operating margins and that it was only
in 2008 that these turned positive (net income of USD 13,503,000 and operating margin of 8%).°*
Further, from 2005 to 2007, AUSA’s ratio of operating costs to revenues was substantially better
than that of LAN Argentina. The Tribunal accepts that 2008 was an exceptionally difficult year
for the Airlines and that they were only (fully) managed by the Claimants until the July 2008
Agreement. As a result, some allowance must be made in considering 2008. In addition, the
Airlines, as flagship carriers, served a broad range of domestic routes. Further, elimination or
substantial reduction of those routes was restricted by Decree 6875/1971, at the time of
privatization, and the 2006 Agreement. On the other hand, when LAN entered the Argentine

market in 2005, it decided to focus almost exclusively on the ten densest routes.

600. Finally, the Tribunal notes that LAN also requested increases of the airfares, both on its

own and as part of CLARA.°°

653 As described above, AUSA operated almost exclusively domestically and 98% of its revenues were generated from
domestic flights.

64 CLEX ER Supp. {fff 49-50 and Table IV.

65 CLEX ER Supp. {51 and Table IV. Compass Lexecon states that the Airlines served more than 30 domestic routes
(CLEX ERI 4 45). As also described above, the Government of Argentina exerted some pressure on the Airlines to
maintain all their routes, particularly those to more remote regions, and to increase frequency of flights.

666 C75; C-76; C-77; C-1045 pp. 40-41. In its letter of March 11, 2008, LAN appears to respond to requests from the
Secretary of Transportation to provide information on its operations for 2008 in light of airfare increases being
considered by the Secretariat. In commenting on the contemplated increases, LAN stated that the airfare increases
should be substantially higher than the proposed 20% to 24% increase of the maximum airfare plus fuel subsidies in
order to truly permit the airline industry to achieve growth and coverage adequate to the size of the country and in line
with the increase with Argentine GDP over the past few years. LAN also stated that while permitting greater revenues
for the airline companies was vital for their survival, it was also necessary to address the fundamental issues faced by
the industry, including the adoption of the bills specified in Decree 1012/2006, amongst other things.

See also C-967: Report of LAN Argentina’s Board of Directors dated May 21, 2008. In that report, LAN’s Board of
Directors stated that the airfare increases granted in April and May 2008 were not sufficient to achieve sustainable
profitability in the long term and that the Board had worked with the Argentine authorities to design an additional
package of measures, both of regulatory and tax nature, which would permit the improvement of the economic
situation of the airline industry which, to date, had not been implemented. See p. 2 of the Board’s report to
shareholders.

Award

601. As a result, the Tribunal is not persuaded that LAN’s activity in Argentina between the
years 2005 to 2008 demonstrates that it operated more efficiently than AUSA or that the airfares
in place at the time permitted an efficient operator to cover its costs and generate a reasonable

profit.

602. The Tribunal now turns to examine Respondent’s other argument that Claimants’ alleged
mismanagement of the Airlines was the cause of their poor performance and the dire situation in

which they found themselves in July 2008.

2. Claimants’ Management of the Airlines

603. Respondent makes a number of arguments with respect to Claimants’ management (or
alleged mismanagement) of the Airlines during the 2001 to 2008 period of their ownership.
Respondent’s arguments appear to be directed towards three key contentions: first, that far from
investing in the Airlines, Claimants damaged the Airlines almost to the point of irreparability;
second, that Respondent was forced to intervene and take control of the Airlines because a vital
public interest was imperiled; and third, the airfares were fair and reasonable and that it was due
to Claimants’ inefficiency and poor management that the Airlines lost money and were in a dire

condition in July 2008.

604. The first contention is closely linked to Respondent’s Counterclaim, in which Respondent
claims damages for the alleged harm done to the Airlines as the result of Claimants’ deficient
management. Respondent argues that Claimants’ business management of the Airlines was

29667

“predatory’ and that the Marsans Group “acted as a parasite of the Airlines, taking advantage

of them, extracting all it could from them, and leaving them in appalling conditions and at the

doors of bankruptcy.”

605. The second contention is closely linked to Respondent’s defense to Claimants’ Claim,
particularly with respect to Respondent’s arguments regarding the legality of its expropriation of

the Airlines. Respondent asserts that Claimants “did not comply with the Argentine regulatory and

company laws by engaging in a conduct that was terribly detrimental to the Argentine Airlines.”

As aresult, the Argentine State was forced “to take control of an airline that was totally abandoned,

which, in turn, implied a risk for the country’s connectivity.”°”°

606. The third contention relates to Respondent’s defense to Claimants’ claim that the airfares
set during the relevant period were not in compliance with the TER standard and hindered the

Airlines’ ability to operate efficiently and earn a reasonable margin.°”!

General arguments regarding Claimants’ performance

607. Respondent contends that Claimants neglected the Airlines during their tenure “to such an
extent that they are almost irreparable.”©’? Respondent points to a variety of practices it alleges led
to the Airlines’ poor condition by July 2008, including inefficient fleet maintenance, an aging and
heterogeneous fleet, asset-stripping, cannibalism of aircraft, obsolete computer systems, a lack of
revenue management policies, and isolation from global strategic alliances systems, among other

practices. °7

608. Respondent asserts that far from providing valuable “synergies” through the network of
Marsans Group companies, “Claimants had nothing to offer to the Airlines.”°”* Respondent argues
that the improved results of the Airlines between 2002 and 2005 were absolutely unrelated to
Marsans’ management. Rather, according to Respondent, the positive results during that period
were caused by the cost dilution resulting from the devaluation, the disappearance of two

competitors, and the recovery of the local domestic market.°”>

609. Claimants argue in response that at the time they acquired the Airlines in late 2001, both
had operations at a virtual standstill. The Airlines had a market share of only 20% of the Argentine

market.°’° ARSA had already been placed in bankruptcy, had substantially reduced its domestic

routes and was only serving one international destination.°”’ Claimants note that Argentina had
publicly declared its willingness to let the Airlines fail and go through liquidation at this time, and

that “Claimants were the only ones preventing Argentina’s flag-carriers from disappearing.”°”*

610. Claimants assert that they restarted operations on all of the previously abandoned routes
and that the number of passengers consistently increased from 2002 to 2005.” They say that
ARSA ticket sales in Europe increased 764% between 2001 and 2007.°*° The Airlines’ share of
the Argentine domestic market share increased from 20% in 2001 to 57% in 2002 and to 82% in
2003.8! All together, they assert that the Airlines’ operations and profitability significantly
improved during the first years of Claimants’ ownership.°*? Moreover, Claimants argue that it
seems hardly reasonable that the Government of Argentina would have renewed the Airlines’
concession in 2004 and 2005, as it did, if they had been doing such a poor job managing the
Airlines. Claimants also say that it was the uneconomical airfares that affected the Airlines’
financial performance and not any alleged lack of efficiency or poor management of the Airlines,

which were properly managed.°**

611. The Tribunal will set out and address here Respondent’s specific arguments regarding the
alleged mismanagement of the Airlines to the extent necessary to address the issues related to
adequacy of the airfares and its effect on the Airlines’ ability to operate efficiently and earn a
reasonable margin of return on their domestic operations. The Tribunal will return to these
arguments, to the extent necessary, below, when it addresses Claimants’ expropriation claim and

Respondent’s Counterclaim.

Fleet management practices
612. According to Respondent, the management of the Marsans Group was characterized by a

complete lack of investment in the fleet and poor maintenance of it.°*°

613. First, Respondent argues that Claimants acquired obsolete aircraft for the Airlines’ fleet.
Consequently, asserts Respondent, the Airlines had the oldest fleet in the market, with an average
age of 20 years, thus doubling the age of the aircraft of other companies in the market, the average
age of which was between five and ten years.°° Respondent asserts that Claimants’ expert,
Mr. Ricover, who asserted that the Airlines’ fleet age was comparable with other large legacy
airlines, wrongly cherry-picks the data. It asserts that in reality, the average age of the fleet of
British Airways and United Airlines is lower.°*’ Respondent argues that the acquisition of old
aircraft resulted in higher fuel consumption, higher maintenance costs and inventory problems,

among other inefficiencies.***

614. Second, Respondent asserts that the Airlines’ fleet included different types and subtypes

maintenance, crew and other costs.® It notes that by 2008, the Airlines had eight different types
of aircraft.©° Respondent argues that fleet heterogeneity entails higher costs because a larger
aeronautical material stock variety is required to maintain it, given the diversity of parts of the
different aircraft. It also asserts that crew expenses are greater given that it is impossible to use the
same crew on different fleets.! Finally, Respondent asserts that although the Airlines had the
same number of “cockpit commonalities” as United Airlines and American Airlines, these latter

airlines have much larger fleets than the Airlines.°?

615. Third, Respondent asserts that Claimants engaged in “cannibalizing” the Airlines’ fleet.
“Cannibalization” is the practice of dismantling aircraft and using the parts on other aircraft in the
fleet. Respondent argues that rather than streamlining inventory pools and planning carefully, the
Airlines’ maintenance practices involved finding and using parts off of existing aircraft and
engines. As such, engines were in storage for months waiting for overhaul.®* Respondent asserts

that in 2008 half the fleet was out of service due to cannibalization.°*

616. Fourth, Respondent asserts that the Airlines took poor care of the planes they leased.
According to Respondent, this made it impossible for them to return to the lessor.°> Respondent
argues that the leased airplanes not only failed to meet the required technical conditions, but also
had unpaid rent and penalties, which made their redelivery impossible. Respondent asserts that
even airplanes in good technical condition had incurred such a degree of contractual infringement

due to unpaid rent that lessors could not accept their redelivery.°°

617. For all these reasons, Respondent asserts that the fleet was in a dire situation by July 2008.
It states that at this time, only three out of 24 of the Airlines’ owned planes were operative, and

only 31 out of 62 of the Airlines’ leased planes were operative.°”

618. Claimants disagree with Respondent’s characterization of the Airlines’ fleet acquisition
and maintenance. First, they rely on the evidence of their expert, Mr. Ricover, that the average age
of the Airlines’ fleet was comparable with that of other major airlines, including American, British
and United. They note that the Government of Argentina acquired or leased even older aircraft
for Airlines after the 2008 nationalization. Moreover, Claimants argue that fleet age should not

be confused with fleet efficiency.” Mr. Ricover asserts that

[Elven though the average fleet age increased significantly between 2006 and 2008, utilization
remained virtually unchanged. In addition, even though fleet age decreased in 2009 as compared to
2008, utilization fell as well. The data presented shows no conclusive evidence on the relationship

between fleet age and utilization. Automatically concluding that an older fleet would be less efficient

is therefore misguided. ”°!

619. Finally, Claimants note that between November 2001 and June 2008, they incorporated a
total of 45 additional aircraft into the Airlines’ fleet, and also entered into a massive Airbus
purchase for ARSA and AUSA to overhaul the fleet with new aircraft of the same manufacturer

and type. 7°

620. Second, with respect to Respondent’s contentions concerning the heterogeneity of the
Airlines’ fleet and the inefficiencies this created, Claimants argue that in fact the Airlines were
comparable to competitors. Claimants’ expert, Mr. Ricover, explained that the proper way to
assess fleet homogeneity from an airline management perspective is to measure the level of
“cockpit commonality”—namely, the ability to operate different types of aircraft within the same
fleet by using the same type-rated crews. Mr. Ricover asserts that all of AUSA’s aircraft presented
the same type-rating and could thus be operated by the same crews, and that ARSA’s fleet was
similarly homogeneous with only five cockpit types, a similar level to most international

carriers.703

621. Third, with respect to what Respondent characterizes as “cannibalization,” Claimants
assert that this is, in fact, the widely-encountered practice of airlines managing their spare parts
inventory between different aircraft.”* Claimants state that aircraft are composed of numerous
components that are designed to be interchangeable and easily removed and replaced. Instead of
immobilizing an entire aircraft when one of its engines requires or undergoes maintenance, an
airline can install another engine on that aircraft (which, for instance, can come from another

aircraft whose mainframe or landing gear is undergoing maintenance at the same time) to

maximize the operational efficiency of the fleet. Claimants assert that this is a widespread

practice. 7°5

622. Fourth, with respect to Claimants’ maintenance of aircraft leased by the Airlines, Claimants
assert that some of the planes had been leased to ARSA before Claimants took over, and on leases
to be returned after 2011. Claimants argue therefore that that they cannot be held accountable for

the condition of these planes in late 2011.7

Information and revenue-management systems

623. Respondent and its experts claim that the information systems used by Claimants at the
Airlines, which included core systems and equipment, networking electronics, base software,

service infrastructure, administration systems, and human resources were outdated. 7°”

624. Respondent also asserts that the revenue management systems used by Claimants were
outdated. These systems are intended to set the guidelines for the adequate commercialization of
tickets and, based on complex mathematical calculations, provide for the correct value of a ticket,
taking into account how far in advance they are booked. In other words, revenue management
permits airlines to sell to the right customer at the right moment at the right price.’°> Respondent
submits that without up-to-date revenue management, the Airlines were hindered in their ability
to support activity growth, ensure continued services, and allow for the development and
deployment of new updates and new-technology-application projects.’° Respondent also asserts
that the Airlines paid their web-booking engine service provider more than twice the rates

proposed by a competitor entity.7!°

the alleged out-datedness and costs of the Airlines’ information and revenue management systems.

had to incur expenses with respect to revenue management after nationalization was because the

Airlines could no longer access the systems that the Marsans Group had used.”!!

Operational and financial performance

626. According to Respondent, the Airlines had poor operational performance, with delays and
cancellations greater than those of their competition.’!? Respondent asserts that when the
Argentine State took control of the companies in July 2008, they were undergoing a virtual

3

operative collapse.’'?_ Respondent also notes that starting in July 2008, the Argentine State was

forced to disburse funds to meet the Airlines’ current liabilities — wages, fuel and other operating

costs — which amounted to ARS 737 million in less than six months.’!4

627. Claimants assert, in response, that an overwhelming majority of delays and cancelations
resulted from the Government of Argentina’s pressure on Claimants through the unions, which
was abetted by Undersecretary of Aerocommercial Transportation, Ricardo Cirielli, and the
Kirchner administration.”'> Claimants also argue that it was Respondent’s policy of “Re-

Argentinization” that led to the Airlines’ “financial agony” during the final years of Claimants’

management.’!°
Failure to rejoin the Clearing House

628. Respondent asserts that the Airlines were disadvantaged by not belonging to the
International Air Transportation Association (IATA) Clearing House. According to Respondent’s

expert witness:

[T]he Airlines’ lack of participation in global airline alliances and in joint ventures and/or code share
agreements was a significant inhibitor of international expansion opportunities. All carriers included
in the benchmark were members of the IATA Clearing House, which provides a “competitive,
seamless secure service providing an efficient on-time settling of interline accounts between the
world’s airlines, airline-associated companies and travel partners.” The service allows for over 450

airlines and participants to settle their accounts through this service. Without participation as a
member in the IATA Clearing House, the Airlines were unable to effectively leverage partnerships
that nearly all airlines utilize. In our experience, most major airlines participate in the Clearing
House, and absence from it is a significant anomaly and can be representative of management
challenges.

629. For their part, Claimants assert that ARSA’s temporary suspension from the IATA Clearing
House did not mean that it could not negotiate or enter into passenger distribution agreements with
other airlines. Rather, these settlements were paid directly between the companies and not through
a central clearing house.’!* Claimants’ expert, Mr. Ricover, states that not having direct access to
the IATA Clearing House did not particularly affect ARSA because most of its activity involved
selling point to point tickets between Argentina and the international destinations, with very little
traffic traveling beyond those points.’!? Moreover, Claimants note that the Airlines were still a
part of the IATA, which enabled their flights to be booked on any booking page.’””° Finally,
Claimants argue that ARSA only regained membership in the IATA Clearing House in 2011, three

full years after the Government took control of the Airlines.’?!

Asset stripping

630. Respondent asserts that Claimants engaged in a practice of “‘asset-stripping” throughout
their tenure with the Airlines. Respondent points to what it alleges was a practice of leasing aircraft
from ARSA’s and AUSA’s fleet for the benefit of other Marsans Group companies, including Air
Comet Espajia and Air Comet Chile.’”? Respondent alleges that when these aircraft were returned,
they were “in a disastrous condition.””*> Respondent also asserts that Air Comet would use ARSA
aircraft for charter flights, on routes that were inefficient for ARSA, with the costs of fuel, flight

crews and attendants borne by ARSA.74

631. Respondent also asserts that the Marsans Group abused its position as an indirect parent
company of OPTAR, an Argentine travel company owned by the Airlines. Respondent alleges that
Claimants unified sales and operations of OPTAR with the rest of the Marsans Group in order to
take the following alleged measures: the lease of OPTAR’s real estate to Marsans Internacional
Argentina S.A. at a “ridiculous” price, the Operation and Sale Structure Unification Agreement,
the assignment of OPTAR’s administration to Marsans, the transfer of a large amount of OPTAR‘s

personnel to Marsans, as well as other actions evidencing the existence of an asset stripping.’”°

632. What Respondent asserts amounted to “asset-stripping,” Claimants argue was the strategic
use of beneficial “synergies” between Marsans Group entities.’”° Claimants deny that the Marsans

Group leased planes between its entities in a way that damaged the Airlines. They assert that the

 

planes that ARSA leased to Air Comet were ones that ARSA could not use efficiently, given their
age and high fuel consumption. Air Comet, on the other hand, could use them on shorter routes,
and paid a monthly lease for them. In short, according to Claimants, Air Comet was able to use
ARSA’s planes that would have otherwise been grounded.’2” Claimants point to other leases on
idle aircraft between ARSA and Air Comet, which they assert were “very profitable for ARSA.”7
Finally, Claimants note that Air Comet occasionally chartered inactive ARSA aircraft, for which
Air Comet paid an hourly cost at arm’s-length prices and generated significant income for

ARSA.”””

633. With respect to Argentina’s accusations regarding the management of OPTAR, Claimants
assert that Argentina itself authorized this unification in 2004 by Resolution No. 1122 of the
Undersecretary of Tourism Policy. Claimants argue that given the complementary nature of the
two companies, it made complete sense to rationalize their management in order to achieve

increased efficiency and economies of scale as part of one travel group.”*°

Tribunal’s Conclusion on Claimants’ Alleged Mismanagement of the Airlines

634. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed all of the Parties’ voluminous submissions, factual
and expert evidence on the issue of the management of the Airlines and concluded that the lack of
efficiency and poor management alleged by Respondent has not been made out and, in any event,
was not the primary cause of the Airlines’ inability to cover their costs and earn a reasonable return
from 2005 to 2008. As noted previously, after the conclusion of the SPA, under Claimants’
management the Airlines’ operations and financial situation improved substantially until, it
appears, the Airlines’ costs (notably for jet fuel and salaries) commenced their sharpest increase

in 2004.

635. In October 2001, when the SPA was concluded, the Airlines’ operations had almost
stopped completely. The Airlines’ liabilities exceeded USD 1 billion and forecasted operating
losses for 2001 exceeded USD 350 million. Further, ARSA had been in insolvency proceedings
since before SEPI’s privatization process had commenced. In addition, ARSA had only one
international destination which it serviced and approximately only 17 operational airplanes. The
Airlines’ market share had also fallen to less than 20% of the Argentine market.”*! Finally, it was
apparent that Respondent was not prepared to contribute funds to assist ARSA and was not

prepared to place the Airlines under state ownership.’**

636. Commencing in 2002, the situation of the Airlines improved rapidly. As noted previously,
in December 2002, ARSA and the majority of its creditors agreed on a plan of debt restructuring
and by the end of 2004 ARSA had repaid the majority of its debt and was relieved from its
obligations under its re-organization proceedings.’*? Further, despite the challenging economic
conditions, the Airlines’ revenues and market share increased substantially. Its market share
improved from approximately 32% at the end of 2001 to 81% in 2004. In addition, the Airlines’
net income improved substantially from 2002 through 2004 such that both Airlines had positive

net revenues in each of those years.’”*4 The Airlines also expanded and improved their fleet.’*>

Finally, ARSA’s concessions, whose expiry dates were approaching, were renewed by the

Secretariat of Transportation in 2005.7°°

637. Allof this evidence supports Claimants’ position that the Airlines were operated efficiently
and that they were sufficiently well managed to achieve significant improvement at both an
operational and financial level. The Tribunal is unable to accept Respondent’s position that this
improvement was due solely to other factors such as the devaluation of the Argentine peso and the
recovery of the market. While these, and other factors, may have been of some influence, the
Tribunal is not persuaded that these were the primary factors in the improvement of the situation
of the Airlines. Further, during the course of 2004, the Airlines’ costs, notably for jet fuel,
commenced a very sharp increase which continued through 2008. In the Tribunal’s view, the
mismatch between these increasing costs and domestic airfares described above had a substantial
impact on the Airlines’ operational and financial management and their ability to manage more

generally.

638. Commencing with the Airlines’ fleet management practices, the Tribunal has found the
evidence of Claimants’ experts, Compass Lexecon, and their industry expert, Mr. Ricover,
persuasive. Amongst other things, the Airlines’ revenue-passenger kilometer (“RPK”) appears to
have increased substantially from 2001 through 2005.”*” Similarly, the Airlines’ available seat-
kilometer per employee ratio also increased substantially from 2001 through 2005.7** Further, it
appears that the Airlines were, in fact, more productive than their regional competitors, TAM,

LAN and Gol.”?

639. The Tribunal has also considered Respondent’s arguments regarding the age and
heterogeneity of the Airlines’ fleet. In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent’s complaints in this regard
do not demonstrate that the Airlines’ fleet was unduly old or heterogonous such that their
efficiency would be affected more than other comparable airlines or that the age of the Airlines’

fleet or the number of different aircraft which composed it constitutes evidence of poor

management. In this regard, the Tribunal finds the evidence of Mr. Ricover persuasive, despite
Respondent’s criticism of his evidence.” Although Mr. Ricover’s evidence on these issues was
not initially clear in light of amendments made to his report, this did not appear to affect its effect.
For example, while Mr. Ricover did not calculate the average age of the entire fleet of British
Airways and United Airlines, which was lower than the age of the Airlines’ fleet, he selected

comparable categories of aircraft and compared these.”4!

In the Tribunal’s view, the use of
comparable aircraft appears reasonable in the circumstances. Mr. Ricover’s evidence tended to
indicate that the age of the Airlines’ fleet was not out of line with that of the other airlines to which

they were compared insofar as comparable aircraft were concerned.

640. The Tribunal has also noted the point made by Respondent that Mr. Ricover attached draft
financial statements for 2007 to his reports although by the time he testified, the audited financial
statements were available. However, it does not appear that any relevant information upon which
he relied differed between the draft and the audited financial statements.”*? With respect to the
alleged heterogonous nature of the Airlines’ fleets, it appears that the Airlines had a similar number
of cockpit types as other airlines with much larger fleets. This tends to indicate that those airlines
had the potential to be more efficient given the larger number of aircraft which could be operated
by the same cockpit crews. However, Mr. Ricover also noted that other airlines had significantly
more cockpit types and yet operated very efficiently.? As a result, Respondent's criticism is not
conclusive. Further, the Tribunal notes that many of the aircraft that the Airlines operated between
2001 through 2008 had been in service for some time and it could be expected that it would take
some time to renew the fleet and, in doing so, achieve higher cockpit commonality. While the
Airlines had started a process of renewal of the fleet by sourcing aircraft from Airbus, they were
unable to complete the large purchase of further aircraft from Airbus and their integration into the

fleet.

641. The Tribunal has also considered Respondent’s other criticisms of the Airlines’ fleet
management practices, including the alleged “cannibalization” of parts and maintenance of leased
aircraft. With respect to the former, the practice of “cannibalization” appears to be a common
practice in the airline industry.“ However, from the evidence, the Tribunal is unable to determine

whether the practice by the Airlines was greater than for comparable airlines in the industry.

642. With respect to the maintenance of leased aircraft, the Tribunal accepts that as at December
2008, a number of leased aircraft were in poor condition such that they failed to meet the required
technical conditions for return to the lessor. In addition, it appears that unpaid rent and penalties

were due. >

643. With respect to the Airlines’ suspension from the IATA Clearing House, the Tribunal finds
that this had a more limited effect on the Airlines during the period of Claimants’ management
than suggested by Respondent. First, the Tribunal notes that throughout the entire relevant period,
both Airlines remained members of IATA and it was only their access to the IATA Clearing House
which was suspended due to an outstanding debt incurred prior to October 2001. Further, it
appears that the Airlines had access to IATA’s billing and settlement plans through the Marsans
Group.”° As a result, the Airlines had access to IATA and were able to clear payments through
the Marsans Group. It also appears that ARSA was able to enter into various distribution
agreements with other airlines. Finally, the Tribunal notes that under Respondent’s management,

ARSA only re-acquired its membership in the IATA Clearing House in 2011. As a result, the

745 Resp. Rej. | 91; RA-434; RA-279. It appears that in all but one case, the aircraft in question were leased prior to
Claimants’ investment in the Airlines and that the earliest expiry date of the leases was in October 2008, with the
balance of the leases expiring in 2009 and 2010: see RA-434 p. 2/16. The ARSA internal report goes on to state that
as at the end of December 2008, only three of the nine B737-200s were in operation. It appears that: two of the aircraft
in question had been out of operation since April and July 2006; two aircraft in question had been out of operation
since January and July 2007; and one aircraft in question had been taken out of operation for scheduled maintenance
in April 2008. Further, it appears that one of the aircraft was sub-leased to Aerolineas Austral Chile S.A. (a subsidiary
of Air Comet). The report also records that as of its date (April 12, 2011), five of the aircraft were in storage at various
airports in “high degree of deterioration and cannibalism”.

It appears that, in the end, the dispute between the Airlines and the lessor was resolved by way of an agreement in
which the Airlines acknowledged the debt for outstanding rents, penalties and interest on arrears (in the amount of
USD 11,468,242.80): see Resp. CM {[ 305.

Tribunal is not persuaded that the failure to re-instate the Airlines’ membership in the IATA

Clearing House demonstrates the poor management of the Airlines alleged by Respondent.

644. The Tribunal has also considered Respondent’s allegations of “asset stripping” relating to
what it alleges was a practice of leasing aircraft from ARSA’s and AUSA’s fleets for the benefit
of other Marsans Group companies. Respondent alleges that these leases were not in the Airlines’
economic interest and that the leased aircraft were returned in poor condition. The Tribunal’s
review of the relevant evidence does not establish Respondent’s allegations. The explanations
supplied by Claimants in respect of the leasing which Respondent impugns appear to make
business sense and to have generated revenue for the Airlines.47 The Tribunal is unable to
conclude on the basis of the limited evidence presented that Claimants engaged in “asset stripping”

in favor of other Marsans Group companies as alleged.

645. The Tribunal has also considered Respondent’s allegations with respect to merging the
management of Optar S.A. with Marsans’ International Argentina. Claimants explained that this
was done instead of leaving the two businesses separate and competing against each other. In this
regard, the Tribunal notes that the Argentine Secretariat of Tourism authorized the unification of

the management of the two companies’ operations in the same premises.’

In support of its
allegations, Respondent relied on an internal report to the General Management of the Airlines
dated February 3, 2012.” While this report makes a number of detailed allegations, there is no
direct evidence of the alleged favorable treatment of Marsans International by way of the alleged
favorable lease of Optar S.A.’s premises, assignment of Optar S.A.’s administration and the
transfer of Optar S.A.’s personnel to Marsans International as well as other actions alleged to
evidence “asset stripping”. As a result, the Tribunal is unable to reach any firm conclusion in

respect of these allegations.

Tribunal’s view, while updating and improvements to the systems used by the Airlines could well
have been made, this does not necessarily demonstrate mismanagement by the Airlines or
Claimants. In reviewing the evidence of Respondent’s expert with respect to information and
revenue management systems, the Tribunal notes that during the period of Claimants’ management
of the Airlines, the latter had access to and used the information technology and revenue
management systems of the Marsans Group. This included, for example, access to the flight
booking system used by the Marsans Group, Amadeus. While there were other systems available
at the time, some of which appear to have been less expensive, the Tribunal is unable to conclude

that the Airlines’ reliance on the Amadeus system constitutes mismanagement. ’°”

647. Respondent’s expert also made a number of other criticisms of the Airlines’ sales and

marketing systems and costs.”*!

These appear to indicate that the Airlines were paying higher
average commissions to distributors with a point of sale in Argentina (an average of 6%, as
compared to the market average of 4% to 5%). They also indicated that other carriers had moved
to a lower base commission rate (1%) versus the Airlines’ 3% base commission rate during the
time of their engagement.’ The Tribunal accepts that improvements could have been made to
the Airlines’ systems and that these may have improved the Airlines’ revenue. However, the

Tribunal is unable to determine with any certainty what impact this had.

648. Respondent relied on the evidence of its expert, Oliver Wyman, in respect of the many
criticisms it makes of Claimants’ management of the Airlines. From its review of that evidence
and that of Claimants’ expert, Mr. Ricover, as well as, to a certain extent, Compass Lexecon, the
Tribunal accepts that a number of improvements could have been made to various aspects of the
Airlines’ operations and management. In other cases, the Tribunal does not accept that the

evidence supports Respondent’s criticisms. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Oliver Wyman

750 See Wyman ER 4 6.3.4.1 which points out the major available systems at the time, including Amadeus. The experts
go on to say that the Airlines were paying Amadeus more than twice the web booking engine rates proposed by one
of its competitors, Sabre. No details for this were provided in support.

751 See, for example, Wyman ER §[ 6.3.4.

752 Wyman ER {| 6.3.4. With respect to the latter, the Tribunal notes that Oliver Wyman’s engagement commenced
in October 2009. As a result, it is hard to determine precisely what the base commission rates for the comparative
airlines were prior to that time or what steps, if any, the Airlines took in regard to base commissions in 2009, or
subsequently.

was retained in October 2009 and that its evidence is based on its observations from that point
forward.’? Further, Oliver Wyman relied primarily on the data for the Airlines for the year 2008
as the basis for its report.” As a result, Oliver Wyman did not examine the state of the air
transport industry in Argentina, including the regulation of domestic tariffs, prior to 2008.7°°
Further, Oliver Wyman was apparently not aware that the commercial air transport sector was in
a declared state of emergency from 2002 through 2008, nor of the fact that other airlines (LAPA,

Dinar and Southern Winds) had gone out of business during that time.”*°

649. For these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the evidence of Oliver Wyman must be
tempered. While it was highly critical of the Airlines’ management and performance, it does not
appear that the entire relevant context was examined in arriving at these conclusions. Further,
Oliver Wyman did not consider the effect of the regulated domestic airfares on the profitability of
the Airlines during Claimants’ management. Oliver Wyman concluded that the performance gaps
which they identified in the management and operation of the Airlines was USD 357 million less
than it should have been based on benchmarked Latin American carriers and USD 248 million less
than it should have been compared to global benchmarks. As a result, they concluded that the
Airlines were facing severe commercial and operational challenges at the time of their study, which
commenced in 2009, and that this outcome had likely materialized over several years of

performance deterioration.”

650. While the Tribunal accepts that a number of the criticisms and gaps identified by Oliver
‘Wyman appear to be valid, for the reasons outlined above, it cannot accept all of them. Further,

the Tribunal cannot accept that the regulation of domestic airfares did not affect the profitability

We were not explicitly instructed as such. But our focus was to, as I mentioned in my PowerPoint
presentation, to first just describe the state of the Airlines as we found them, and then look at a path
forward. So we did not spend any time exploring time periods prior to ‘08.

Transcript pp. 835-836. It does not appear that Oliver Wyman was aware of the levels at which airfares had been

set, nor the effect that these might have had on the performance of the Airlines. According to

them, “there were ways in which the Airlines could manage its way to break even without the tariff structure ever

changing.” In Oliver Wyman’s view, the airfares were not “...one of the drivers of the Airlines’ unprofitability.” See

of the Airlines. As indicated previously, AUSA’s revenues were generated almost exclusively by
domestic transportation and domestic airfares represented approximately 25% of ARSA’s revenue.
In their letter of April 29, 2008 to the Secretary of Transportation, the Airlines identified the loss
in net income flowing from the regulation of airfares at levels below the TER standard at a range
of USD 390 million to USD 450 million.”8 Claimants’ experts, Compass Lexecon, estimated the
historical losses due to the setting of domestic airfares between September 2002 and 2008 at

USD 268 million for AUSA.”*°

651. Having carefully reviewed all of the relevant evidence, the Tribunal is unable to conclude
that the alleged inefficiencies and mismanagement of the Airlines was the sole or primary cause
of their losses during the period of 2002 through 2008. While the Tribunal accepts that some of
the criticisms made by Respondent and its experts may be valid and may have contributed to some
extent to a loss of revenue, it is unable to accept that the regulated domestic fares had no role to
play. Rather, the Tribunal has found the regulated domestic airfares were insufficient to permit
the Airlines to cover their costs relating to their domestic operations. This is particularly the case
in respect of AUSA whose revenue was generated almost exclusively from domestic airfares. In
the Tribunal’s view, the low, regulated domestic airfares had a substantial impact on the Airlines’

financial and operative performance and Claimants’ ability to manage the Airlines efficiently.

652. In addition, the Tribunal believes that the difficult circumstances of the airline industry
during the time the Airlines were owned by Claimants should be borne in mind. As noted
previously, a state of emergency in the air transportation sector in Argentina was declared in 2002
and maintained throughout the relevant period. The various decrees and resolutions adopted by
the Government during that time reflected the very difficult conditions faced by the industry both

in Argentina and internationally.

759 The estimate calculated to August 2010 for AUSA was USD 390 million. Discounted to January 2008, the amount
is USD 268 million. Compass Lexecon had also quantified the airfare squeeze damages for ARSA, differed to 2010,
in the amount of USD 269.7 million. However, according to Claimants, this claim would only come into play in the
event of a finding of unlawful expropriation. In any event, Claimants did not rely on Compass Lexecon in support of
its damages claim in so far as ARSA is concerned. See Cl. PHB { 200.

653. In conclusion, in spite of the provisions in the regulatory framework providing for the
establishment of domestic airfares in accordance with the TER, it does not appear that the
economically reasonable tariff was ever calculated or set by the Secretary of Transportation or any
other of Respondent’s government agencies. Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that the Ministry
of Transportation, and the Government of Argentina more broadly, was aware of the need to adjust
airfares to address the interests set out in Article 42 of the Air Business Law, including the need
to permit airlines to cover their costs and earn a reasonable profit. Although the Secretary of
Transportation increased the reference airfare, and consequently the maximum airfare cap, during
the course of Claimants’ ownership of the Airlines between 2001 and 2008, the increases to the
airfare and other measures adopted did not keep pace with the steadily increasing costs faced by

the Airlines during the period in question. As a result, the airfares set between 2001 and 2008 did

  

not comply with the TER standard. Further, Respondent’s failure to adjust airfares sufficiently to
meet the TER standard affected the Airlines’ ability to operate efficiently and earn a reasonable
margin of return. Finally, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the alleged inefficiencies and
poor management of the Airlines explain or account for the Airlines’ losses from 2005 through
2008. The Tribunal now considers whether the failure to set domestic airfares in accordance with

the TER standard amounted to a breach of the FET standard under the Treaty.

3. Does the failure to set airfares in accordance with the TER standard amount to a
breach of FET under the Treaty?

Positions of the Parties

654. Claimants submit that Respondent failed to abide by its specific commitments, promises
and guarantees regarding Claimants’ ability to charge economically reasonable airfares. Claimants
say that their legitimate expectations were grounded on clear rights and specific commitments and
guarantees provided in the regulatory framework at the time of their investment.” They specify
that they were entitled and expected Respondent to comply with the following specific

commitments, promises and guarantees regarding domestic airfares:

Economically Reasonable Airfares, and thus promised to implement (i) a 50% cut in the
value-added tax (VAT) for fuel; (ii) a tax exemption from the VAT for aircraft leased with a
purchase option; (iii) the right to use VAT surpluses to pay any other taxes and Social
Security obligations; and (iv) a tax exemption from the VAT applied to insurance policies
purchased outside Argentina;

* The promise to increase airfares made specifically to Claimants’ representatives in 2005
during meetings with Argentina’s highest Government officials;

. During the negotiations of the June 2006 Agreement, and in exchange for increasing its
stockholding in ARSA, Argentina promised to increase airfares, setting them in accordance
with the regulatory TER standard;

* Through Decree 1012/2006, Argentina again specifically recognized that it was not providing
air carriers with Economically Reasonable Airfares, and thus promised to implement (i) a
50% cut in the value-added tax (VAT) for fuel; (ii) a tax exemption from the VAT for aircraft
leased with a purchase option; (iii) the right to use VAT surpluses to pay any other taxes and

. In the May 2008 Agreement, Argentina made the additional promises to grant a series of

Airlines economically viable.”

Claimants say that Respondent disregarded these rights, guarantees or commitments.’°

656. In response to Respondent’s arguments, Claimants say their position has never been that
Respondent should have changed the regulatory framework in place at the time of their investment
in order to benefit them nor do they argue that the FET standard should operate as an insurance
policy against bad investments. Rather, Claimants say that they were entitled to charge
economically reasonable airfares, covering their direct and indirect costs and providing a
reasonable margin of return, but Respondent refused to adjust airfares or implement alternative

relief measures throughout the entire period of their investment.’

657. Amongst other sources, Claimants rely on the decision in the Suez case” which they say
addressed a very similar pattern of conduct where the tribunal found that, by refusing to adjust
tariffs and using claimant’s ensuing difficulties in order to unilaterally force the renegotiation of
that concession, Argentina had frustrated the claimant’s legitimate expectations regarding the legal
framework in force and the obligation to provide investors with a stable and predictable legal
framework.’ Claimants also relied on the decision in the EDF v. Argentina case,”*’ which they
say also analyzed a factual pattern similar to the one at issue here, where they say the tribunal
found that Argentina was required to provide the investor “‘long-term political and regulatory
stability... [and specifically] tariffs were to be determined in a way that afforded the concessionaire
sufficient income to cover all costs associated with the distribution of electricity as well as to obtain
a reasonable return on its investments’”. Claimants say that, in that case, Argentina was found to
be in breach of its obligations under the FET standard, not because it actively changed the

regulatory framework substantially, but because it had failed to adjust tariffs to the largely

658. Relying on Suez and EDF, Claimants say that Respondent violated the FET standard by
frustrating the Claimants’ legitimate expectations by failing to abide by its own legal and
contractual commitments, promises and guarantees. Claimants say that these included the ability
to charge economically reasonable airfares and obtain a reasonable margin of return on their

investment.’

659. For its part, Respondent denies any breach of the FET standard with respect to the domestic
airfares under the legal regulatory framework. It denies the scope that Claimants attribute to the
FET standard and says, rather, that that standard reflects only the minimum standard of customary
international law. It also disputes that the expectations of an investor are a source of obligations
under the FET standard.” Without conceding Claimants’ arguments regarding legitimate
expectations, Respondent says that if these were to be taken into account for the purpose of
argument, any expectations must be considered in the factual circumstances of each case and the
circumstances relating to each investor as well as the conduct of the host state. Further, it says that
the subjective expectations of a claimant are not relevant and that, in those cases which have
accepted the concept of legitimate expectations, the claimant was required to demonstrate
legitimate and reasonable expectations in light of all the circumstances. The tribunal must

approach the question from an objective and reasonable point of view.’7!

660. Respondent says that in the circumstances of this case, Claimants could not have had the
legitimate expectations they claim in light of the state of the Airlines when the Marsans Group
took over in 2001, the token price of USD 1 (for which it received USD 803 million from SEPI),
ARSA’s insolvency proceedings, the situation in the commercial air transport market after the

Further, Respondent says that Claimants conducted no due diligence prior to signing the SPA.’
Respondent also says that investment treaties and the FET standard are not insurance policies
against bad business decisions made by investors. It says that Claimants had invoked the FET
standard to hold it liable for the consequences of their poor management and poor business

decisions.’

661. Respondent also denies that the FET standard includes the notion of legal stability or, in
this case, the stability of the regulatory framework. In any event, Respondent says that the
regulatory framework in this case did not change throughout the relevant period. Rather, it says
that it was Claimants who wanted to have the regulatory framework changed by way of de-

regulation.7”*

In this regard, Respondent distinguishes the Suez and EDF cases upon which
Claimants rely. Although it does not accept the decisions in those cases, Respondent says that
they illustrate why Claimants’ claim in this case is substantially different and unfounded.
Respondent says that in both Suez and EDF, the tribunals found that there had been fundamental
alterations of the regulatory framework.””> In addition, Respondent says that it responded to the

requests from the airline industry to increase airfares and took other measures to assist it.””°

and reasonable in all of the circumstances. It also denies the rights, guarantees and commitments

which Claimants allege arose after they took over the management of the Airlines.”””

the content of this obligation by both the context of the Treaty itself and the decisions of other
tribunals who have developed the content of this obligation by interpreting this particular Treaty,

as well as numerous other treaties with similar provisions in different factual scenarios.

664. The Tribunal is guided by the Vienna Convention, which directs that the Treaty “shall be
interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the
treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose” and that the purpose can be gleaned
from the text of the Treaty, its preamble and annexes and other related agreements. The preamble

of the Treaty provides:

The Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as “the Parties”,
Desiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries,

Intending to create favorable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the
territory of the Other State,

 

that the pi ion and ion of inves in with this Agr t
will encourage initiatives in this field...

665. Thus, the general obligation to treat the investment fairly and equitably arises in the context
of the Treaty, the stated purpose of which is to “intensify economic cooperation”, “create favorable
conditions for investments”, and to promote and protect investments in order to encourage
investment. “Treatment” according to the Oxford dictionary definition is “the manner in which

someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something.” In the case of the Treaty, the
treatment that is to be fair and equitable relates to the treatment of the investment by the
Government of Argentina. Previous tribunals which have turned their mind to the definition have
adopted the formulation of the standard by the S.D. Myers tribunal that the standard is breached
where there has been “treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to

the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.”’”

666. In terms of content, the Tribunal is of the view that fair and equitable treatment is not only
the minimum standard of treatment at international law, as that term is not used in the Treaty. The

minimum standard of treatment is a customary international law principle that sets out the

78 §.D. Myers Inc. v. Canada, 140 ILM 1408, J 263; Saluka, | 297, C-325; Suez at 231.

obligations owed by a State to aliens and, as such, evolves over time as State practice and opinio
juris changes to include today’s notions of minimum standards.’”” As discussed above, the Vienna
Convention directs the Tribunal to interpret the words of the Treaty “in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of

its object and purpose.”7*?

667. While the term legitimate expectations is also not found in the Treaty, the fair and equitable
treatment language has been interpreted to oblige a State not to frustrate an investor’s legitimate
expectations, either at the time of the investment or in the course of the investment, as long as
those expectations were objectively reasonable, created by the State (the State intended for the

investor to rely upon them) and relied upon by the investor.7*!

In determining what constitutes
legitimate expectations, the Tribunal agrees that these must be considered in light of all of the
circumstances of a case from an objective and reasonable point of view. In other words, what
would have been the legitimate and reasonable expectations of a reasonable investor in the position

of the Claimants here at the time they made their investment?7*?

668. The aspect of the fair and equitable treatment obligation that relates to legitimate
expectations responds to change - usually in a State’s changes to a regulatory regime upon which
an investor relied in making its investment. It has also been consistently held that it is not
legitimate for investors to expect that a regulatory regime or laws will never change and that a
State has the right to change its laws. In doing so, it will not breach its obligation to treat investors

fairly and equitably if it changes its laws in a legitimate exercise of its regulatory authority.’**

669. Turning first to the question of Claimants’ legitimate expectations at the time of their
investment in October 2001, the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that in all of the relevant

circumstances, Claimants could not reasonably or legitimately have held the expectations they

 

7 Even the U.S. and Canada, which both specifically link the minimum standard of treatment or general international
law obligations with the fair and equitable treatment standard in their investment agreements, recognize that the
standard evolves.

claim with respect to airfares under the existing regulatory framework (listed above at paragraph

654).

670. The Tribunal recalls, first, the circumstances in which the SPA was concluded and
Claimants took over the Airlines. As noted previously, both Airlines were facing serious financial
difficulties, with ARSA in insolvency proceedings since June 2001. Liabilities exceeded USD 1
billion and forecasted operating losses for 2001 were in excess of USD 350 million. ARSA was
losing approximately USD 40 million per month and had cancelled all its international routes
except one and was operating only 30% of its domestic routes. Although it had not filed for

insolvency protection, AUSA was in similarly difficult circumstances. ”**

671. By October 2001, the Argentine economy was also in very difficult circumstances and on
the verge of economic crisis. The international airline industry had also been affected by the events
of September 11, 2001. Further, the airlines operating in Argentina were engaged in a destructive
airfare war which was depressing airfares.’*° The evidence also indicates that SEPI was keen to
free itself of a significant portion of accumulated liabilities and to put an end to the continuous

contributions made to support the Airlines over a period of approximately 10 years.7°°

672. The evidence also indicates that Claimants and Air Comet performed very little, if any, due
diligence before agreeing to the SPA. Other than what Minister Bastos described as the “general
regulatory conditions” and that Argentina did not have an open-sky policy, that routes were granted
by concession, that other airlines operated in the domestic area and that international services
competed with other international airlines, there was no indication that Claimants engaged in a
review of the regulatory framework or relied on any representation or commitment by
Respondent.’*” Notably, there was no indication that Claimants had reviewed the General Transfer
Contract nor made any inquiry in respect of the concept of the TER. It also appears that Minister

Bastos advised the representatives of Claimants that the Government of Argentina wished to see

the Airlines to continue in operation, but that it was not prepared to contribute public funds to

assist them.’

673. It appears that Claimants prepared a business plan for the purposes of SEPI’s tender process
and the SPA. However, the only business plan in evidence was a summary of the general
parameters of the management which the Marsans Group intended to implement over the next
three years.’®° This summary plan does not reflect any inquiry into the airfare system nor any
assumptions on the evolution of airfares. This is consistent with the evidence of Mr. Muiioz Perez

that very little in the way of due diligence had been done before the signature of the SPA.””°

674. Turning to the regulatory framework in place in 2001, this has been described above.
Although the Tribunal has concluded that the framework did provide for the setting of airfares in
accordance with the TER standard, this required a close examination and interpretation of the
various laws and decrees. There was no evidence that Claimants had made any inquiries or sought
any clarification or assurances in respect of the regulatory framework at the time of their
investment. Further, despite the fact that the regulatory framework had been in place for some
time, there is no indication that Claimants made any inquiries as to how airfares were set under the
regime, nor how they had been set in the past. This is despite the insolvency of ARSA and the

very substantial accumulated liabilities and ongoing losses suffered by the Airlines.

675. Finally, although there was no specific evidence of Claimants’ reliance on it, the Tribunal
has considered the nature and content of the regulatory regime governing domestic air

transportation at the relevant time in order to determine whether, objectively, it could have given

788 Bastos WS 4 6, 36. Minister Bastos also indicated that Claimants’ representatives did not request any special
treatment or privilege from the Government which, in any event, could not have been granted.
789 See Cl. Reply | 73; SPA: C-18; Plan de Negocio - Resumen Memoria Explicativa Sobre Grandes Pardmetros: RA-

the date of the document is not entirely clear (it bears a date of “11/09/01” on its front page). According to Claimants,
they periodically revised the Airlines’ business plan. However, there was no other business plan in evidence, other
than a projection of the development of the Airlines’ active fleet: C-42.
7 In his statement before the Argentine Congress, Mr. Muiioz Perez stated, in part:

rise to the legitimate expectations claimed by Claimants. In this regard, the Tribunal finds that the
regulatory regime governing air transportation in Argentina differed in a number of ways from the
regulatory regimes governing other public utilities or services, including gas distribution, water

and sewage concessions and electrical power distribution concessions.’*!

For example, the
regulatory regime addressed in the Suez case was quite different from the one governing airfares
in the domestic transportation industry under consideration here.’ In that case, the bidding rules
pursuant to which the concession contract was awarded to the claimants, and the concession itself,
specifically provided for tariff revisions on the basis of increases in costs and extraordinary
revisions caused by specified economic factors, including modification of the ARS/USD exchange

rate.”5

676. Similarly, in the case of EDF, the regulatory framework, particularly with respect to tariffs
payable to electricity distributors, was considerably more detailed than the provisions of
Law 19,030 and Decree 6875/1971 in respect of domestic airfares.”"* The relevant provincial
legislation provided specifically for how electricity tariffs were to be set and provided for both
ordinary and extraordinary tariff reviews. Further, importantly, the relevant concession agreement
specifically provided that accounting of costs reflected in the tariff schedule and periodic
adjustment was to be in USD and tariff adjustments, to be done every 12 months, were to be
conducted on the basis of U.S. producer and consumer price indices.’°> Further, the Tribunal notes
that in these, and in other industries such as gas distribution, the relevant concession holders were
granted exclusive rights as opposed to the competition permitted in the domestic air transportation

industry.

677. Asaresult, the Tribunal finds that the regulatory framework for domestic air transportation
at the time of Claimants’ investment did not provide an objective basis for much in the way of
expectations on the part of Claimants. The applicable legislation was very general in nature, and
did not reflect any specific intention or commitment to protect tariffs by way of reviews on the
basis of currency stability, foreign indices or other mechanisms. While the General Transfer
Contract did make reference in general terms to the calculation of domestic airfares in accordance
with Law No. 19,030 (of 1971) pursuant to Articles 42 through 46 of that Law, no further provision
was made with respect to the currency in which airfares would be calculated or to their revision in
accordance with a foreign price index. Further, there was no evidence of any specific reliance

placed by Iberia or Air Comet and Claimants on the terms of the General Transfer Contract.

678. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have not demonstrated on an objective
basis any legitimate expectations in respect of the regulatory regime, particularly airfares, relating
to their investment in the Airlines in 2001. Rather, the Tribunal concludes that while investing in
the Airlines pursuant to the bidding process conducted by SEPI may have offered Claimants an

opportunity, it also brought with it significant financial and other risks.

679. This does not, however, exclude the expectation that the conduct of Respondent subsequent
to Claimants’ investment would be fair and equitable. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts that
Claimants could expect that Respondent would comply with its laws and regulations and act
transparently, grant due process and refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or
exercising coercion.””° The Tribunal now turns to this question, commencing with Claimants’

allegations relating to the setting of domestic tariffs and the “Airfare Squeeze”.

680. Claimants allege that Respondent failed to abide by its specific commitments, promises
and guarantees regarding the Airlines’ ability to charge economically reasonable airfares by failing
to grant increases to domestic airfares. Having carefully reviewed the detailed evidence with
respect to the setting of airfares between October 2001 and July 2008, the Tribunal is not persuaded

that Respondents’ conduct amounted to a breach of the FET standard set out in the Treaty. While

during that period costs increased very substantially and domestic airfares did not keep pace with
these, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the failure to grant the fare increases requested amounted

to a breach of the FET standard.

681. The Tribunal notes that, unlike other cases involving Respondent, this is not a case where
fundamental changes were made to a regulatory regime providing specific terms for the setting,
review and revision of public service tariffs. In fact, no changes to the basic regulatory framework
governing domestic airfares were made during the period of Claimants’ investment. Claimants
acknowledge this, as well as the fact that four airfare increases were granted between 2002 and
2008. Claimants’ complaint is that Respondent did not properly apply the regulatory framework
by granting airfare increases which would have permitted them to charge domestic airfares at the
TER standard. Nevertheless, it is useful to bear in mind the distinction between the circumstances
of this case and the various other cases dealing with tariff adjustments relating to concessions in
other services. Another distinguishing aspect between this and other cases is that the domestic
airfares were not frozen and the Secretary of Transportation and the Government of Argentina did

grant airfare increases in response to requests from the Airlines and other airlines.

682. As noted above, in September 2002, Decree 1654/2002 declared a state of emergency in
the air transportation sector and, recognizing the increase in costs in the sector, provided for an
increase in domestic airfares of approximately 41% in nominal terms and re-established airfare
bands at approximately 60%. The Decree also provided for the preparation of a bill to provide
additional assistance to assist airlines to meet the cost increases and difficult circumstances they
were facing. While Claimants maintain that this increase was inadequate to meet the TER
standard, the Tribunal accepts that, unlike in other industries, an increase to the airfares was
granted in difficult economic times. Further, it does appear that the bill requesting tax measures
to assist the airline industry was prepared, although it was never adopted by Congress. While
reference to these tax measures in Decree 1654/2002 reflects a recognition of the need to provide
additional assistance to airlines, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that it constituted any
commitment or guarantee of actually obtaining the adoption and implementation of those

measures.

683. The next request for airfare increases was made by the Airlines in 2004 in the amount of
8%. Although the Secretary of Transportation rejected the Airlines’ request for a larger fare
increase, this was done on the basis of a study conducted by the Secretariat of Transportation on
the basis that the airlines had increased their airfares, as permitted by Decree 1654/2002 and
achieved positive operating results and profits for both 2003 and 2004. The Airlines’ appeals were
dismissed by the Secretary of Transportation, again on the basis of a report prepared by the
Secretariat.””” Claimants argue that the denial of the airfare increase requested in 2004 was in
contravention of the regulatory framework since, in its view, the increase in its revenues or the fact
that it had achieved a profit did not disentitle it to an airfare increase in accordance with the TER
standard. Whether or not Claimants are correct in this regard is not determinative. In the
Tribunal’s view, what is relevant is that the Secretary of Transportation considered the Airlines’
request and determined it on the basis of a reasoned study. The Tribunal also notes that the Airlines
substantially improved their operational and economic situation and earned profits in both 2003
and 2004. In these circumstances, even if the decision to deny the airfare increases was not in

compliance with the TER standard, it does not appear to have been made arbitrarily or in bad faith.

684. After 2004, the increase in costs, particularly the cost of jet fuel, accelerated sharply.
Further, in November 2005, a significant strike affecting all airlines operating in Argentina
occurred. This and the increasing costs in the industry led to meetings with representatives of
Claimants, the Government of Argentina and unions. This was followed by negotiations which,

eventually, led to the June 2006 Agreement and Addendum.”*

685. Shortly after the adoption of Decree 1012/2006, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary of
Transportation complaining that the airfare increase granted was insufficient to allow them to
charge economically reasonable airfares. This letter was followed by others from the Airlines and

from CLARA. It appears that the Airlines met with the Secretary of Transportation to discuss the

77 See above at J 395. Although Mr. Cirielli supported the initial recommendation not to increase airfares, the decision
was by the Secretary of Transportation. Further, it appears that Mr. Cirielli played no role in the appeal, in light of
the challenges brought against him by the Airlines in the courts.

798 See {] 398-406, above. This was followed by the adoption of Decree 1012/2006 on August 7, 2006. That decree,
amongst other things, continued the state of emergency in commercial air transportation in Argentina, an increase in
airfares of approximately 20% and the establishment of an aviation fuel subsidy scheme.

need to revise airfares and their increasing costs and salary demands from the unions representing
their employees.’ Correspondence and discussions appear to have continued throughout 2007.
In early 2008, the Secretariat of Transportation was studying the air transportation industry and
the improvement of service. In that context, it requested comments from the Airlines on proposed
measures to increase airfares by approximately 30% and to fix the maximum price for jet fuel at
ARS 1.80 per liter.*°° This was followed by the adoption of Resolution ST No. 257/2008 on April
11 and Resolution ST No. 315/2008 on May 16, 2008. Each of these resolutions provided for
airfare increases of approximately 18%. Resolution ST No. 257/2008 made reference to the
increasing costs faced by airlines, the complexity inherent in determining air transportation costs
and the need for external technical assistance to identify a satisfactory adjustment procedure in
order to determine economically reasonable airfares. Resolution ST No. 315/2008 made reference
to technical studies which indicated that the airfare increases provided for in Decree 1012/2006

were insufficient to cover cost increases since August 2006.*°!

686. It also appears that the Secretariat of Transportation was considering other steps to address
the financial situation of the Airlines. This is reflected in the May 2008 Agreement which provided
for the entry of another private sector shareholder in the ownership of the Airlines.*° As
previously indicated, the proposed investor did not proceed to invest and the May 2008 Agreement
was not implemented.*? The Tribunal addresses separately, below, the Parties’ allegations

regarding the alleged breach of the May 2008 Agreement.

687. The Tribunal’s review of all of the evidence relating to the various communications
between Claimants and the Secretariat of Transportation and other representatives of the
Government of Argentina with regard to airfares does not lead it to conclude that Respondent’s
failure to approve the various airfare increases requested by the Airlines amounts to a breach of

the FET standard in the Treaty. As noted by Respondent, no change was made to the regulatory

framework during the period of Claimants’ investment. Further, Respondent did respond to
requests by the Airlines, and other airlines operating domestically, for airfare increases and other
forms of relief to meet the difficult circumstances of the industry. The evidence indicates that the
Secretary of Transportation reviewed the status of the Airlines and granted airfare increases in
2002, 2006 and 2008. While Claimants say that the Secretary of Transportation improperly denied
their request for an airfare increase in 2004, this was done on the basis of studies prepared to
address the Airlines’ request and, in the circumstances, was not arbitrary. The Tribunal notes that
the Airlines had competitors in the domestic market and that the various conditions which led to
the increase in costs were common to all airlines. The decision to deny the airfare increase
requested applied to the entire industry and, therefore, was not, in the Tribunal’s view,

discriminatory.

688. Claimants also complained that Respondent was slow in implementing the airfare increases
it did grant as well as other measures such as the fuel subsidies. However, in this regard, as well
as the question of setting airfares more broadly, the Tribunal accepts that the issues involved were
complex and that Respondent had other concerns to address, including the maintenance of service
to various parts of the country and prices to users. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts that some

deference or leeway should be granted to Respondent in balancing these interests.°™*

689. Finally, the regulatory framework governing domestic air transportation was general in
nature and not well developed. This includes the notion of the TER which, eventually, the
Secretary of Transportation came to recognize required the assistance of technical experts to
calculate.*°° There was no indication that the Secretary of Transportation had ever calculated the
TER and the available evidence tends to indicate that, in fact, this had never been done since the

adoption of the Air Business Law and Decree 6875/1971.

84 In this regard, see: Resp. CM [ 835; Resp. Rej. | 743 where Respondent refers to the award in the Kardassopoulos
v. Georgia case where the tribunal held that the respondent State was entitled to a measure of deference in determining
whether a measure was in the public interest. The Tribunal believes that in the circumstances of this case, a similar
approach should be adopted on this issue.

895 See Resolution ST No. 257/2008: C-181/RA-341, discussed above.

690. On balance, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that Respondent’s conduct in the setting of
airfares and denying the Airlines’ requests for increases during the period from 2001 through 2008
rises to the level of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. As a result, Claimants’
claim that Respondent’s role in the alleged “airfare squeeze” constituted a breach of the FET

standard under the Treaty fails.

691. The Tribunal now turns to the other conduct or measures of Respondent that Claimants

allege breached the FET standard protected in the Treaty.

D. Other Acts of Alleged “Re-Argentinization” and Undue Pressure Exerted by the
Government of Argentina

692. According to Claimants, “President Kirchner’s administration was hostile towards
Claimants’ management of the Argentine Airlines and seemed driven by a desire to ultimately ’re-
Argentinize’ the companies. The administration sought to—and ultimately did—teach this goal by
taking a number of measures which destabilized the legal and business environment surrounding
the Claimants’ investment.” Claimants point to 1) the appointment and maintenance in office of
Mr. Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation; 2) alleged pressure exerted on Claimants by
the Government of Argentina through the unions; 3) the judicial challenges filed by Respondent
against three of ARSA’s financial statements; 4) the negotiation of an agreement with Respondent
in 2006, by which they allege Respondent extracted a greater shareholding in the Airlines in return
for a promise to raise airfares; and 5) Respondent’s alleged pressure on Claimants to sell their

controlling interest in the Airlines.°°”

delaying the airfare increase for months; (iv) crippling Claimants’ financial position so as to be in a stronger position

text of the true agreement with a different version. This behavior is certainly in violation of the BIT and customary

1. The Role of Undersecretary of Air Transportation Ricardo Cirielli

693. Claimants assert that there was one key individual who embodied—and helped execute—
the Government of Argentina’s backhanded strategy: Mr. Cirielli, Undersecretary of Air
Transportation. Claimants request a finding that Respondent’s appointment and maintenance in
office of Undersecretary Cirielli as well as his harmful conduct toward Claimants in his capacity

as an organ of the Government were arbitrary, unfair and inequitable under the Treaty.*°*

694. Mr. Cirielli was appointed Undersecretary by President Kirchner on May 29, 2003, and he
remained in office until the end of his term in December 2007.8” Mr. Cirielli served under
Secretary of Transportation Jaime, who himself was in office between 2003 and 2009.*!° Prior to
his appointment, Mr. Cirielli was the Secretary General of APTA (Asociacién del Personal
Técnico Aerondutico), which Claimants characterize as one of the Argentine airline sector’s most
powerful unions. During his tenure as Undersecretary, Mr. Cirielli remained on an unpaid leave of

absence from APTA, and he returned there at the end of his term in office.

695. Claimants assert that in his capacity as Secretary General of APTA, Mr. Cirielli spoke out
against Claimants on several occasions.*!! While in office, Claimants assert that he made a number

of negative statements about Claimants, transforming his earlier anti-Claimant position into

official government policy.*!? According to Claimants, Mr. Cirielli coined the phrase “re-

Argentinization” to refer to his position that the Airlines should have Argentine owners,*!? and

Claimants have failed to meet their burden of proof.*”° Specifically, Respondent notes that
comments made by APTA after Mr. Cirielli took office cannot be attributed to Mr. Cirielli.5*! It

involvement in any case involving ARSA’s interests.

701. Respondent asserts that only the conduct of Mr. Cirielli while he held office is relevant in
the instant case with a view to determining the alleged responsibility of the Argentine State.**
Nonetheless, it argues that Claimants have relied upon the conduct of Mr. Cirielli before he was
in office, which cannot be relevant for the purposes of determining the international responsibility
of Argentina. **! The only acts actually performed by Mr. Cirielli during the period of his tenure as
a government official, that Claimants invoked as the basis of their FET claim are his opposition to
the requests for airfare increases for the Airlines and his alleged support for strikes. As noted
above, Respondent asserts that Claimants have not established their burden of proof in respect of
these acts.*** Respondent further argues that news articles that speculate about Mr. Cirielli’s

personal intentions are not attributable to the State under ILC Article IV.

702. Commencing with the question of attribution, the Parties agree that insofar as the conduct
of Mr. Cirielli as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation is concerned, the applicable principles
are contained in Article IV of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the ILC Articles). The
Tribunal notes the Parties also appear to agree that only Mr. Cirielli’s conduct while in office is
directly attributable to Respondent. Accordingly, only the conduct of Mr. Cirielli during his tenure
as Undersecretary of Air Transportation is relevant to this claim. Claimants acknowledge this
when they state that the evidence of Mr. Cirielli’s statements made before his appointment are
submitted only to show his alleged public animosity towards Claimants and not in order to legally
attribute those statements to Respondent.**4 The Parties also seem to agree that the purely private
conduct of Mr. Cirielli during his tenure as Undersecretary of Air Transportation is not attributable

to Respondent.**

Airlines should be owned by Argentine interests and that this, and his expressed hostility to the
Marsans Group, became Respondent's official policy. In reviewing these allegations, the Tribunal

705. Claimants say that Mr. Cirielli’s views and strong opposition to the ownership and
management of the Airlines by the Marsans Group was carried over to, and continued throughout,
his tenure as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Claimants rely on press reports and a press
release by another union to support this. While the Tribunal accepts Respondent’s position that
newspaper articles do not provide direct proof of Mr. Cirielli’s personal views or intentions and

must be treated with caution,®*”

it accepts, on the basis of all of the evidence submitted in respect
of this issue, that Mr. Cirielli held, and likely maintained during his tenure as Undersecretary of
Air Transportation, a negative view of the Airlines’ ownership by the Spanish Marsans Group.
However, the relevant issue is whether Claimants have demonstrated that this attitude influenced
Mr. Cirielli’s conduct in such a way as to affect the Airlines, and Claimants, to the extent that their

right to fair and equitable treatment was breached.

706. In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that Respondent may have appointed Mr. Cirielli as
Undersecretary of Air Transportation and maintained him in office until 2007 does not, in itself,
amount to a breach of Claimants’ rights. While this appointment may have resulted in an
Undersecretary of Air Transportation who was sympathetic to stakeholders other than the Airlines

and their owners, this was a political appointment which Respondent was entitled to make. In

order to prove a breach of Claimants’ right to fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty,
Claimants must show that Mr. Cirielli’s conduct as Undersecretary of Air Transportation resulted

in the arbitrary or discriminatory treatment of Claimants’ investment in the Airlines.

707. In this regard, Claimants allege that Mr. Cirielli called for and supported strikes against the
Airlines in support of a policy to “re-Argentinize” the Airlines. They rely on a number of
newspaper articles and certain press releases by other unions in support of this contention.***
Having reviewed these various articles and documents, the Tribunal is not persuaded that they

provide sufficient, reliable proof of Claimants’ allegations.

708. Claimants also allege that Mr. Cirielli’s attitude towards the Marsans Group and its
ownership of the Airlines led him to oppose the Airlines’ request for an airfare increase in
December 2004. As discussed above, the denial of the Airlines’ request was on the basis of an
internal study of the Secretariat of Transportation. While Mr. Cirielli supported the study’s
conclusion that the airfare increases requested were not warranted, there was no indication that
Mr. Cirielli, himself, had authored the report or influenced its conclusion. Further, the decision on
whether or not to grant the airfare increases was made by the Secretary of Transportation, and not

Mr. Cirielli.

709. Claimants also allege that Mr. Cirielli personally instigated the Government’s challenge of
ARSA’s financial statements for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004.**° It appears that there was some
discussion between various Government ministries, and within the Secretariat of Transportation,
as to whether the financial statements of ARSA for 2002, 2003 and 2004 should be approved by
the Government as a shareholder. It appears Mr. Cirielli was of the view that the financial
statements should not be approved and that he disagreed with the Secretary of Transportation in
this regard. As described previously, ARSA’s financial statements for 2002 through 2005 were

not approved until the signature of the June 2006 Agreement.*#° As will be discussed below, the

849 See YJ] 403 - 411, above. As part of the June 2006 Agreement, the Parties agreed to transfer shares of ARSA to the
Government of Argentina to achieve a total of 5% of ARSA’s stock and to permit the Government to increase its

Award

approval of ARSA’s financial statements generated considerable discussion and controversy for
some time. While, ultimately, the Government agreed to approve the financial statements, the
objections to their approval were not entirely unfounded.**! As a result, the Tribunal is not
persuaded that Mr. Cirielli acted arbitrarily in raising his objections to the approval of the financial
statements. In any event, Claimants have not demonstrated that Mr. Cirielli’s views determined,

or affected, Respondent’s conduct in respect of the financial statements.

710. The Tribunal has also considered the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeals of
November 15, 2005 and the Anti-Corruption Office of March 29, 2006 finding that Mr. Cirielli
had a conflict of interest between his position as Secretary General of APTA, albeit while on leave
of absence, and his dealings with ARSA as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation and required
him to refrain from dealing with any matters in which ARSA had an interest. There is no indication

that Mr. Cirielli failed to comply with these directions after they were rendered. *4”

711. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the only conduct of Mr. Cirielli that was attributable
to Respondent was his conduct while he was in office as Undersecretary of Air Transportation.
The evidence tendered in respect of that conduct was not sufficient to persuade the Tribunal that
Mr. Cirielli’s apparently negative view of the Spanish ownership of the Airlines affected the
treatment of the Airlines and Claimants’ rights in respect of them. Accordingly, Claimants’ claim

that Mr. Cirielli’s conduct amounted to a breach of the FET standard by Respondent must fail.

2. Unions

712. Claimants assert that, as part of Respondent’s plan to “re-Argentinize” the Airlines, the
Government of Argentina “found in two of the Argentine Airlines’ powerful unions an alliance of
convenience.”*** Claimants describe damaging strikes and unreasonable demands made by the

APLA and APTA unions, which weakened Claimants financially and made their need for fare

shareholdings up to 20%. In addition, the Parties agreed that the financial statements of ARSA for 2005 would be
approved. As described below, all of the financial statements for 2002 through 2005 were approved.

841 The debate around the approval of the financial statements appears to have centered on the subrogation of ARSA’s
debt by Air Comet and how this should be accounted for: C-873.

842 See, for example, RA-303.

increases even more urgent. They allege that Respondent directed and encouraged or supported

these strikes.

713. Claimants point to an eleven-day strike in November 2005 that they claim “took a serious
toll” on ARSA’s economic performance (estimated at approximately ARS 27 million) during high
season.* According to Claimants, the strike prompted negotiations between the Airlines and the
Government in December, culminating in a provisional agreement with the unions regarding a 10-
20% salary increase to take effect in March 2006, at the same time that the Government would
increase the airfares.°> However, Claimants state that by March 2006, the Government had failed
to implement the fare increases, and the unions were again pressing for salary increases. Claimants
state that they met again with the Government in May 2006, and President Kirchner promised to
grant fare increases, but on the condition of the conclusion of a 25% salary increase for the unions.
Claimants assert that they complied with the Government’s request and concluded an agreement

with certain unions on May 15, 2006.*46

714. Claimants also point to a “campaign of harassment” by the unions in 2007, which they
alleged involved a strike on average every fifteen days.*4’ Claimants assert that these strikes

constituted a “final attack” against Claimants’ ownership of the Airlines.*4*

715. Respondent does not contest the occurrence of the strikes, but asserts that the strikes were
not due to any secret conspiracy but rather a number of specific conflicts between the Airlines and
the unions. Respondent asserts that the mandatory conciliations ordered by the Ministry of Labor
demonstrate that the issues between the Airlines and the unions included non-compliance with
collective bargaining agreements, deductions on account of unauthorized union leaves,
remuneration categories, non-wage monthly payments, formalization of temporary-to-permanent

employment, and airline-imposed restrictions on union activity.*4?

716. More generally, Respondent argues that these kinds of strikes are not unusual, were not
specific or limited to Claimants, and were entirely foreseeable. Respondent asserts that the aviation
industry is one of the most highly unionized, due to the number of unions, and the high level of
unionized personnel in a large workforce.**° It also asserts that Claimants were or should have
been fully aware of this dynamic, and points out that Mr. Diaz Ferran himself noted that union and
employee relations were “highly conflicted” when Claimants took control of the Airlines.*°!

Finally, Respondent notes that union conflicts continue to occur at ARSA and AUSA.

717. Finally, the Parties strongly disagree over the Government of Argentina’s alleged role in
encouraging the unions to strike. Claimants assert that there is ample evidence that unions like

APTA and APLA in various instances acted “on the instructions or under the direction or control”

of the Government of Argentina, per Article VIII of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.*°?

Claimants assert that the “overall control” standard should be applied in the instant case,*°? and

that this standard is satisfied.

718. Specifically, Claimants assert that the Government of Argentina gave “implicit support” to
the APLA and APTA strikes.**4 They also argue that it exercised control over APTA through
Undersecretary Cirielli, citing media and union press statements that describe Mr. Cirielli’s
influence on the strikes.*°> Claimants also assert that there is evidence that the Government of

Argentina controlled “or was at least aligned in interest” with APLA.*°°

719. Respondent asserts that, as a general principle, the conduct of individuals or entities is not
attributable to the State under international law.**” Exceptional circumstances may be invoked
when the conduct of a person or group of persons was engaged in under the instructions, the
direction or the control of the State. In such cases, the applicable standard of control under
international law in order to determine whether such conduct is attributable to the State is that of

“effective control.”§*

720. Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to present any convincing evidence that
either the Government of Argentina generally, or Undersecretary Cirielli specifically, controlled
the unions or induced them to strike.**° Respondent notes that the Argentine Ministry of Labor
presided over numerous conciliation proceedings between the Airlines and the unions with the
purpose of avoiding strikes and resetting relationships.*° Respondent also notes that both APLA
and APTA filed a complaint with the International Labor Organization against the Government of
Argentina regarding its role as an intermediary in the labor conflicts with the Airlines during
Claimants’ management, alleging that the Government of Argentina had undermined their rights

of association. *°!

721. The Parties agree that the question of the attribution of the conduct of the unions are subject
to the principles contained in Article VIII of the ILC Articles. That Article provides as follows:
“the conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under
international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under

the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”

persons is acting “under the direction or control of’ the State. Claimants maintain that the standard

should be that of “overall control”, while Respondent says that the appropriate test is “effective

control”.*°? Having reviewed the Parties’ arguments and the various authorities cited, the Tribunal

finds Professor Kingsbury’s opinion on this point persuasive and concludes that in the

circumstances of this case, the test is effective control.8°

723. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants have demonstrated such control by
Respondent, through Mr. Cirielli or otherwise, over the various unions involved in strikes against
the Airlines, notably APTA and APLA. In this regard, the Tribunal finds the evidence of
Mr. Caneto, the Deputy Director of Labor Relations for the Ministry of Labor, persuasive.* The
Tribunal’s review of this and other evidence does not indicate that the strikes that Claimants
complain of were carried out on the instructions of, or under the directions or control of
Respondent. As a result, the Tribunal finds that Respondent did not have effective control over

the unions and that their conduct cannot be attributed to it.

724. The Tribunal has also considered Claimants’ argument that Respondent exercised overall
control over APTA through Mr. Cirielli, as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. As indicated
above, the Tribunal believes that the appropriate test for the attribution of the unions’ conduct to
Respondent is effective control. In any event, even applying the lower “overall control” test
advocated by Claimants, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. Cirielli, or Respondent, exercised
such control over the unions. While Mr. Cirielli may have been sympathetic to the unions, there
is no reliable indication that he was involved in organizing, coordinating or planning the unions’
activities, nor that he financed, organized or provided operating support while he was the
Undersecretary of Air Transportation.’ As a result, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the conduct
of the unions of which Claimants complain can be attributed to Respondent. Accordingly, a breach

of the FET standard under the Treaty on this basis must be dismissed.

3. Financial statements

725. Claimants assert that the Government intentionally undermined the Airlines by challenging
ARSA’s financial statements in its capacity as ARSA’s minority shareholder. Claimants assert that
the Government’s representative in ARSA voted against the approval of the 2002, 2003 and 2004
ARSA financial statements, and Respondent also brought judicial challenges against all three sets
of financial statements. According to Claimants, these challenges were baseless, since the
Government had been timely provided with the necessary documentation and because the

statements had been audited. Claimants also assert that the Government was perfectly willing to

drop the judicial challenges as a condition of concluding the 2006 Agreement.*”

726. In response, Respondent argues that the Airlines commingled assets in a non-transparent

way and failed to provide the Government with sufficient access to relevant information.** It

asserts that it had a legitimate right as a minority shareholder to take legal measures in the face of
the irregularities in the statements.*°? Respondent also says that by purchasing and subrogating
the claims of creditors in ARSA’s insolvency and then contributing them to ARSA’s capital, Air
Comet diluted Respondent’s shares in ARSA to less than 2%.°”? Respondent also maintains that

due to these and other issues, there were a number of inconsistencies and irregularities in the

financial statements until these were corrected in 2006.57!

727. Respondent also says that as a consequence of the dilution of its shareholding to less than
2%, its shareholding fell below the minimum required by law to request information from the

company and, as a result, it was converted into a simple passive shareholder.*”

entitled it on the ARSA Board. See, in this regard, Mr. Llorens’ letter of November 21, 2006 on behalf of the Ministry
of Planning to the Secretary of Transportation providing a favorable opinion on the steps taken by ARSA’s Board to
address Respondent’s complaints regarding limited access to information, adjust the draft financial statements, the
reinstatement of the State’s 5% shareholding, the addition of one more appointee to ARSA’s Board and the designation
of one member of the Company’s audit committee. The letter also notes the amendments agreed (in the June 2006
Agreement) to give Respondent the power to veto certain decisions of strategic importance. See RA-363.

728. From its review of the Parties’ arguments and the relevant evidence, the Tribunal is unable
to conclude that Respondent intentionally undermined the Airlines by challenging ARSA’s
financial statements. Independent of the ultimate merits of Respondent’s complaints outlined
above, Respondent had the right, as a shareholder, to vote against the adoption of the financial
statements it challenged and to have recourse to the courts to annul the resolutions adopting them.
The Tribunal is unable to determine, on the basis of the available evidence, the merits of
Respondent’s complaint about the lack of information provided to it. However, it does note that
some changes were made with respect to the information made available to shareholders and that
adjustments were made to ARSA’s 2005 financial statements to the satisfaction of the Ministry of

Planning.

729. With respect to Respondent’s agreement to withdraw its court challenges to the financial
statements, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent’s willingness to do this reflects that the
initial challenges were baseless. Rather, the withdrawal of the lawsuits was part of a compromise
which resolved a contentious issue between the shareholders of ARSA.8”? Finally, the fact that
Respondent was able to negotiate the transfer of approximately 3.8% of ARSA’s shares to bring it
back to its original shareholding of 5% does not, in the Tribunal’s view, reflect improper conduct.

Rather, it forms part of a compromise negotiated between the shareholders of ARSA.

4, The June 2006 Agreement

730. Claimants assert that they continued to negotiate with the Government through the first
half of 2006 to find a solution to the Airlines’ financial difficulties. According to Claimants,
Secretary of Transportation Jaime demanded that the Government be allowed to increase its
control and shareholding participation in ARSA as a condition of increasing airfares and of
withdrawing the judicial challenges against ARSA’s financial statements.*”4 Claimants assert that

they felt obligated to negotiate an agreement, since they so badly needed an airfare increase.

873 In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the challenges to the financial statements and lawsuits were based on
Respondent's complaints relating to the implementation of the SPA and the capitalization of ARSA’s debt.

However, they believe that they were “extorte and “coerced’”®”° by the Government into

signing the June 21, 2006 agreement on these terms.

731. Claimants request that the Tribunal find that Argentina violated the FET provision in the
Treaty: (i) by unlawfully pressuring Claimants to sign the June 2006 Agreement and relinquish to
the Government of Argentina 3.8% of their shares in ARSA with the promise to grant
Economically Reasonable Airfares and the withdrawal of groundless challenges to ARSA’s
financial statements; (ii) by unilaterally and in bad faith modifying the text of the June 2006
Agreement, and (iii) by violating the June 2006 Agreement, including by not setting TER-
compliant airfares and failing to comply with its 15% stock option of ARSA by making the
corresponding cash contribution. Specifically, Claimants request that the Tribunal find that this
conduct breaches the FET standard under the Treaty and forms part of a creeping expropriation

process, which culminated in the confiscation of Claimants’ investment in 2008.877

732. Inresponse, Respondent argues that the June 2006 Agreement did not bind the Government
of Argentina to Claimants since the latter were not parties to the Agreement. Moreover,
Respondent says that a simple breach of contract cannot constitute a breach of the FET standard;
otherwise the distinction between treaty and contract would collapse and contracts could be
brought into the treaty framework in a way not supported by most of the jurisprudence. In any

event, Respondent says that it did not repudiate or breach the June 2006 Agreement.*”*

733. On June 20, 2006, the Government of Argentina signed the Agreement with ARSA and
Interinvest. The Agreement provided for 1) the approval of the 2005 financial statements, 2) the
increase of the Government of Argentina’s share in ARSA of a minimum of 5%, with the
possibility of an additional 15% increase, 3) certain modifications to the voting rights of Class A

shares, 4) the Government’s agreement to desist in its lawsuits concerning the financial statements

of 2002, 2003 and 2004 and 5) an agreement for the parties to take steps to arrange an eventual
public offering of shares.’ An “addendum” to the Agreement dated June 21, 2006 altered certain

terms of the June 2006 Agreement, notably with respect to the rights of Class “A” shareholders.

734. The Parties disagree on the motivation behind Respondent’s demand for a share increase
through the June 2006 Agreement. Respondent argues that Air Comet had acted fraudulently in
capitalizing certain claims following ARSA’s bankruptcy in 2001, and this had had the effect of
diluting the Government of Argentina’s shares in the company.**? Respondent complains in
particular about “false entries” with respect to the capitalization in 2001 of funds provided by
SEPI,; these alleged false entries resulted in the dilution of Respondent’s shares in the airlines to
less than the 2% minimum that allows shareholders to request information and file claims.**!
Accordingly, Respondent asserts that the share increase provided by the June 2006 Agreement

served to “reinstate” its interest in the Airlines that had been previously reduced.***

735. Respondent argues, moreover, that the June 2006 Agreement consisted of mutual
concessions: the “regained” shareholding for Respondent, on one hand, and the withdrawal of
Respondent’s legal challenges to the financial statements on the other.**? Respondent asserts that
there was no coercion on its part. It notes that the Marsans Group never made any statement
regarding the alleged coercion at the time the Agreement was executed.*** It also points to an
Interinvest Board of Directors meeting, which described the June 2006 Agreement as follows:

... Recuerda que Interinvest también particip6 y suscribié los documentos, que reflejaron entre otras

cuestiones que la sociedad debfa solucionar la restitucién del 5% de la participacién que el Estado

736. For their part, Claimants deny that their repayment of ARSA’s debts resulted in the dilution
of Argentina’s shares in the Airlines, and they argue that at any rate, Argentina could have matched
Interinvest’s capital contributions to avoid dilution. Claimants therefore dispute that the June 2006
Agreement’s provisions regarding Argentina’s 5% option serve to “restore” what had been taken
from Argentina. Rather, they assert that the June 2006 Agreement gave Respondent a 3.8%
shareholding “without paying a dollar,” and that, as such, it was unlawfully taken by the

737. Claimants also assert that Respondent failed to observe most of the commitments of the
June 2006 Agreement. Specifically, they allege that the August 2006 fare increase granted per
Decree 1012/2006 was insufficient and late.**’ Claimants also assert that even though Respondent
later exercised its 15% stock option in ARSA under the June 2006 Agreement, it then failed to

follow through and never made the required cash contribution. **

738. In response, Respondent notes that neither the June 2006 Agreement nor its addendum
contained any stipulation regarding a commitment of airfare increases. Moreover, Respondent
points out that on August 7, 2006, the Argentine Executive issued Presidential Decree 1012,
providing an additional 20% fare increase, extending the state of emergency in the commercial air
sector, continuing an exemption from taking out commercial aviation insurance within Argentina,

and establishing an Aviation Fuel Subsidy Scheme.**”

739. Finally, Claimants submit that Respondent deceived them in the formal signing of the
Agreement. Claimants allege that the Agreement that the Government presented and that
Claimants signed during an official visit of President Kirchner to Spain was, unbeknownst to
Claimants, different from the terms to which the parties had previously agreed. According to
Claimants, the new agreement gave the Government shareholding privileges that Claimants had

previous rejected in earlier drafts of the Agreement. Claimants state that with the support of the

an addendum to the Agreement restoring the originally-agreed terms'*”°

740. Respondent denies that any deception occurred in the signing of the June 2006 Agreement,
and that Claimants have failed to produce any evidence to support their assertions.*°! Respondent
also argues, in the alternative, that Claimants are estopped from arguing deception when they did

not fulfill the duty of diligence to read the Agreement before signing it.*°?

a number of issues at the next annual/special meeting of the shareholders of ARSA. As
Respondent submitted, no reference is made to an increase in airfares in the text of the June 2006

Agreement, nor the Addendum.

743. Nevertheless, Claimants submit that an increase in airfares had been promised by
Respondent and formed part of the June 2006 Agreement which Respondent breached when it
failed to increase airfares in an amount sufficient to cover the Airlines’ costs and achieve the TER
standard.**? Claimants say that they relied on the promises made to it by the Government of
Argentina to increase airfares to meet the TER standard to agree to the terms of the June 2006
Agreement.*** Claimants also say that Respondent’s representatives told them that airfare
increases would only be granted if ARSA granted wage increases to APTA and APLA’s
members.**> Therefore, Claimants argue that Respondent conditioned airfare increases on their

political needs and coerced their agreement to the June 2006 Agreement.

744. The evidence surrounding the negotiation of the June 2006 Agreement, commencing with
the strike by the unions, APTA and APLA, in November 2005, is complex and not altogether clear.
It appears that the strike by the unions, which lasted nine days, led to a request by the Government

of Argentina that representatives of the Marsans Group travel to Argentina to discuss the resolution

896

of the strike. It appears that during the course of discussions, Mr. Diaz Ferran advised

Respondent that the Airlines could not increase wages to resolve the strikes without an airfare
increase, to which the Government responded that it would increase airfares and provide a subsidy

for jet fuel once an agreement was reached with the union. This led to the signature of a provisional

agreement with the unions in December 2005 and the resolution of the strike.*°”

745. Although the precise details of the strike and the negotiations between Claimants’
representatives, the unions and representatives of the Government are not clear, the Tribunal
accepts that the Government was concerned about the strike which had paralyzed the operations
of the Airlines and affected air transportation in Argentina and that it would seek to act as an
intermediary to resolve the situation. The Tribunal also accepts that, in this context, the
Government would summon the unions’ representatives to discuss a solution with Mr. Diaz Ferran
and other representatives of the Airlines. While there appears to have been some familiarity
between the Government and the union leaders, the Tribunal does not find this necessarily
surprising and is unable to conclude that the Government orchestrated or supported the strike.
Finally, the Tribunal does not find it surprising that in the context of discussions surrounding the
strikes, increases in airfares and other measures were discussed and that the Government indicated

that it would increase airfares in order to assist in finding a solution to the strike.

746. The Tribunal notes that neither the increase in airfares nor the increase in union salaries are
referred to in the June 2006 Agreement. This is perhaps not surprising given the nature of the June
2006 Agreement. The June 2006 Agreement is in the form of an agreement between the
shareholders of ARSA to discuss and resolve certain issues at the next shareholders’ meeting.
However, the Tribunal is unable to accept that the increase in airfares discussed between the
representatives of Claimants and the representatives of Respondent during the course of the various
meetings relating to the June 2006 Agreement formed part of that agreement. As a result, the
alleged delay and inadequacy in the airfare increase granted in Decree 1012/2006 in August 2006
cannot give rise to a breach of the agreement. Rather, the question of the increase of the airfares,
and Claimants’ allegations that it was inadequate, falls to be decided within the more general
question of whether Respondent permitted the Airlines to charge economically reasonable tariffs.
As discussed above, the Tribunal has concluded that Respondent’s conduct in this regard does not

amount to a breach of the FET standard (see paragraphs 654 - 691, above).

747. With respect to the items listed in the June 2006 Agreement, the Tribunal finds that each
of the parties complied with their obligations: Interinvest transferred approximately 3.2% of
ARSA’s stock to Respondent free of charge and provided an option for Respondent to increase its
stock holdings to up to 20%; amendments to ARSA’s by-laws were made in order to provide for

Award

certain rights which would attach to Class “A” shares; and Respondent withdrew the legal
proceedings challenging the approval of ARSA’s financial statements for the years 2002, 2003

and 2004.*** As a result, the Tribunal finds that neither Party breached the June 2006 Agreement.

748. The Tribunal has also considered Claimants’ complaint regarding the alleged deception by
Respondent in the drafting of paragraph l(c) of the June 2006 Agreement relating to
Section 1(c)(ii) of ARSA’s by-laws in respect of the voting rights attaching to Class “A” shares
held by Respondent.*” In the Tribunal’s view, the alleged deception was more likely due to a lack
of communication or complication in the process of finalizing the June 2006 Agreement. It appears
that any intentional deception was unlikely since one could normally anticipate that the agreement
would be reviewed before signing and that any departure from the agreed final version would be
noticed by Claimants. In any event, the modification made by Respondent’s representatives was

noticed and an addendum containing the parties’ agreed, revised language was signed.

749. With respect to Claimants’ allegations regarding the transfer of Class “A” shares to
Respondent to achieve a 5% shareholding and the withdrawal of Respondent’s challenges to the
financial statements, these have been addressed in the previous section. For the reasons stated
there, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that these demonstrate arbitrary or other conduct which

rises to the level of a breach of the FET standard set out in the Treaty.

5. Respondent’s pressure on Claimants to sell the Airlines

750. The Parties agree that the Airlines were in a very difficult financial condition by the end of
2007 and early 2008. Claimants note that “[b]y 2007, ARSA had an EBITDA of US$4 million,
net losses amounting to US$116 million, and an increase in the company’s accounts payable (or
commercial debts with suppliers) of US$34 million compared to 2006. AUSA’s situation was not
much better. By the end of 2007, its EBITDA had dropped to US$ 4 million, net losses amounting
to US$21 million, and AUSA’s account payables (short term debt with suppliers) increased US$20

which it requested were made.

million between December 2007 and June 2008.”°° Respondent characterizes the Airlines as

being in a state of “imminent collapse” by the spring of 2008.”°!

751. Claimants attribute this “financial agony” of the Airlines to Argentina’s policies (described

in the preceding sections of this Section), abetted by the unions’ frequent strikes.°°”

752. In contrast, Respondent attributes the Airlines’ condition to Claimants’ alleged
mismanagement of the Airlines. Respondent also asserts that by the spring of 2008, the Airlines
were “threatening” to cease all services in several destinations and to reduce flight frequency in

others.°°

753. In this context of the Airlines’ financial turmoil, Claimants assert that Respondent placed
increased pressure on them “to compel them to sell part or all of their stake in the Argentine
Airlines to a local businessman or to the GOA itself.”°* They argue that Argentina’s ever-
increasing “asphyxiation” strategy culminated in 2008 with a series of measures that concluded in

the formal expropriation of the Airlines.

754. Specifically, Claimants assert that the Government of Argentina’s attempts to pressure
them into giving up their control of the Airlines, first through de facto government representatives
and then subsequently through the May and July 2008 Agreements, constitutes a part of
Argentina’s creeping expropriation of the Airlines.*” Claimants also assert that Respondent then
breached both the May and July 2008 Agreements, violating the Treaty’s FET clause as well as
the umbrella clause in Article II(2)(c) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, imported through the Treaty’s
MEN clause in Article IV(2).

Early 2008 attempts to negotiate a sale of the Airlines

755. According to Claimants, they were approached in early 2008 by a group of investors
interested in purchasing the Airlines. This group was led by Mr. Manuel Vazquez, a purported
advisor to Secretary of Transportation Jaime, and Mr. Miguel Angel Llorente, a private investor.?”°
While it does not appear that Mr. Vazquez had an official government position, Claimants state
that he was nonetheless an “advisor” to Secretary of Transportation Jaime, and that the negotiations
he led were therefore “de facto” negotiations with the Argentine government.” According to
Claimants, it was clear from Mr. Vazquez that the Government of Argentina wanted a sale and

transfer of control settled quietly and without any publicity.°°

756. Respondent rejects the assertion that the group of investors who offered the $150 million
for the Airlines were de facto representatives of the Government. Respondent asserts that the letters
between Claimants and the potential investors do not mention Mr. Vazquez, and certainly do not

include the Government of Argentina as part of this group of investors.”

757. The relevant facts relating to this are summarized above at paragraph 417. While
Claimants’ witnesses, Messrs. Pascual de Riva, Pascual Arias and Mujfioz Pérez, all testify to the
de facto involvement of the Government of Argentina in this attempted deal, the documentary
evidence on the record is inconclusive. An April 2, 2008 letter from Mr. Angel Llorente to
Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, which includes the proposed terms of the offer, does not
mention Mr. Vazquez or the Government of Argentina.?!° An April 3, 2008 response letter, written
by Mr. Mujfioz Pérez, counters with a higher sale price, and also includes as a condition that each

of the prospective buyers be identified by name and percentage of ownership.?!!

758. Claimants assert that after some negotiations, Mr. Mujfioz Pérez rejected the $150 million

offer, which they considered to be too low.?!?

759. While Respondent may have encouraged or facilitated the approach by Mr. Vazquez, the
Tribunal is unable to find that this formed part of the alleged attempt by Respondent to force out
Claimants. Further, while ARSA may have been facing another strike (this time by APLA), the
evidence does not bear out that this was coordinated by the Government through Mr. Perez

Tamayo to put additional pressure on Claimants.

The May 2008 Agreement

760. Claimants say that the Government of Argentina subsequently made an official attempt to
induce an investor to take over the Airlines. According to Claimants, in mid-April 2008,
Mr. Ernesto Gutiérrez advised Mr. Pascual Arias that he had been asked by the Government of
Argentina to act as an intermediary for the purpose of allowing Argentine investors to acquire
participation in ARSA and in increasing the Government of Argentina’s shareholding. It appears
that in May 2008, Mr. Gutiérrez introduced Mr. Lopez Mena to Claimants. Claimants say that
Mr. L6pez Mena was interested in acquiring a controlling participation in the Airlines and that he
had the Government of Argentina’s support. Further, in May 2008, Messrs. Pascual Arias and
L6pez Mena agreed to initiate a due diligence process for the purchase of a majority share of the
Airlines.*!? Claimants assert that Mr. Lopez Mena insisted that the Government of Argentina grant

him certain guarantees that would allow the Airlines to improve their performance.?'*

761. In the meantime, representatives of the Government of Argentina and of the “Air Comet-
Interinvest Group”, as the majority shareholder of the Airlines, negotiated the May 2008

Agreement.

Agreement, Mr. Lopez Mena, did not proceed with the contemplated investment.?!> Claimants

say that this was due to Respondent’s failure to comply with the terms of the agreement. Claimants
say that but for an insufficient airfare increase of 18% and an incomplete fuel subsidy, Respondent

failed to implement the other commitments it undertook in the agreement.°!°

763. Claimants say that Respondent’s failure to comply with the May 2008 Agreement
constitutes a breach of the FET standard under the Treaty and forms part of a creeping
expropriation process that culminated in the formal expropriation of Claimants’ investment in
2008. Claimants also say that the terms of the May 2008 Agreement confirm Respondent's failure

to approve economically reasonable airfares.°!”

764. Respondent argues in response that it did not repudiate or fail to meet its obligations under
the Agreement. Moreover, it argues that the May 2008 Agreement does not bind the Government
of Argentina to an agreement with Claimants, who are not parties to the Agreement. It also argues
that a simple contract breach cannot constitute a breach of the FET standard; otherwise the
distinction between treaty and contract collapses and contracts may be brought into the treaty

framework in a way not supported by most jurisprudence.?!®

serious situation of the Airlines.°”°

767. The May 2008 Agreement provided for two main features: 1) a new corporate structure
and ownership chain (with the controlling indirect interest in the Airlines going to the new

investor), and 2) Argentina’s agreement to implement specific measures to assist the Airlines.

768. With respect to the first feature, the Agreement provided for the reallocation of shares in
the Airlines from Interinvest to a new corporate vehicle which would hold 70% of ARSA’s share,
divided 48% to the Air Comet-Interinvest Group and 52% to the new investor; the Government of

Argentina (up to 20%) and Airline employees (up to 10%).°”

Specifically, the Agreement
contemplated that (i) Claimants would sell AUSA to ARSA, (ii) the Government of Argentina
would make an equity contribution in ARSA and increase its participation in ARSA by 15%, and
(iii) Claimants would sell a controlling indirect interest in both airlines to Mr. Lopez Mena.°” The
price to be fixed for the shares for the public sector’s interest and the Argentine private company’s
interest was to be based on “the average of the appraisals conducted by three consulting firms with

expertise in international quality appraisals selected by the Shareholders with the approval of the

 

Argentine State”—namely, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley.?**

769. Claimants subsequently obtained the valuations of | AUSA from

USD 476 million (DCF valuation); and by Morgan Stanley a range of USD 450 million to 550

770. With respect to the second feature of the May 2008 Agreement, the “Viability Measures

of ARSA’s debts, among other measures (Articles 2.1-2.11). According to Claimants, these
provisions constituted recognition on the part of the Government of Argentina “that new and
urgent airfare increases, tax exemptions and fuel subsidies were needed to make the Argentine

7929

Airlines viable’ and to make the transaction with Mr. Lopez Mena go forward.

771. The Parties agree that the transaction with Mr. Lopez Mena that was contemplated by the
May 2008 Agreement did not materialize. However, the Parties disagree on the reasons for the
failure of the transaction. Specifically, each Party attributes blame to the opposing Party for

Mr. L6pez Mena’s withdrawal from the proposed transaction.

772. Claimants allege that the Government of Argentina failed to provide adequate assurances
on the airfare increases and subsidies promised under the May 2008 Agreement.” Claimants
point, in particular, to a press interview with Mr. Lopez Mena on May 9, 2008, before the
Agreement was signed, in which he asserted that he would not invest in the Airlines if Respondent
did not reduce taxes and provide subsidies. With respect to the measures promised by Respondent,
Mr. L6pez Mena asserted, “What we are asking, and I’m asking this through you, is that the

Government treats us in the same way airlines are treated in serious countries.”?*!

According to
Mr. Pascual Arias, Mr. Lopez Mena was then “scared away” from the deal contemplated under the
May 2008 Agreement, due to the Government of Argentina’s record of not fulfilling its

commitments and the lack of certainty that the situation would be any different this time.°?”

773. In response to Claimants’ assertion, Respondent argues that the Argentine Secretariat of
Transportation did in fact raise airfares by 18% as required by the Agreement, and did so on
May 16, 2008, the day after the Agreement was executed.°** Argentina had previously granted an
increase of 18% on April 11, 2008.%4 Respondent also asserts that the Secretariat of

of ARS 1.85 per liter to airlines for the domestic transportation of passengers.” Secretary of

conceded that the process to make the tax changes and address other encumbrances was started,

but never executed.°*°

774. Respondent also argues that it was not Argentina’s actions but, rather, Claimants’ own
conduct that dissuaded Mr. Lopez Mena from finalizing the deal. Respondent points to a May 7,
2008 letter from Mr. Lopez Mena to Mr. Pascual Arias clarifying that any such deal was contingent
on the favorable results of the audit of the Airlines.°>’ Respondent also references a statement
made by Mr. L6pez Mena’s company, Buquebus: “[M]r. Lopez Mena decided not to proceed with
the purchase of the Airlines because he could never become sufficiently familiarized with the
economic, financial and operative situation of the Companies, given that, as already stated, the
Marsans group failed to furnish the required information.”°** Mr. Llorens testified that the
May 2008 Agreement failed because Interinvest did not provide “in a complete fashion the
information needed for the due diligence so as to assess the value of the company.”®*? Finally,
Respondent notes that Claimants’ witness, Mr. Mufioz Pérez, testified to the Argentine Congress

in August of 2008 that the May 2008 Agreement failed “because it was not viable,” and because

“we were unable to implement it in the adequate deadline.”°*°

775. The evidence relating to the reasons for Mr. Lopez Mena not proceeding with the deal is
inconclusive. At the time, the Airlines were already in difficult financial conditions and there was
evidence of uncertainty surrounding airfares and fuel subsidies. In addition, the proposed deal was
complex and the valuations obtained by Claimants were substantial. Thus, the negotiation of the
proposed deal could have been expected to take time and there were several potential points of
disagreement and uncertainty. As a result, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that either Party was

responsible for the failure of the proposed transaction described in the May 2008 Agreement.

776. Further, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent’s involvement in the May 2008
Agreement and its attempt to introduce another private sector investor was improper or amounted

to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment due to Claimants’ investment in the Airlines.

The July 2008 Agreement

777. After the deal contemplated by the May 2008 Agreement fell through, the Airlines’
financial situation continued to deteriorate. Claimants assert that “[b]y mid-2008 the Argentine
Airline’s financial condition hit its worst point since Claimants acquired them in October 2001.”°4!
Respondent characterizes the Airlines as being “in truly bankrupt condition” by this time.?”
Respondent moreover asserts that it entered an agreement with the aviation unions on July 9, 2008
to maintain normal labor relations and the provision of air services,“ and that when the Airlines
were unable to make payroll for June 2008, the Government of Argentina began to make payments
to cover wages and operating expenses as part of its “emergency financial assistance” to the

Airlines.°

778. After the failure of the May 2008 Agreement, Interinvest and Respondent began
negotiations for the purchase of the Airlines directly by the Government of Argentina. On July 17,
2008, Interinvest and Argentina signed the July 2008 Agreement. Under the terms of the

Agreement, Interinvest agreed to sell all of its shares in the Airlines for a price to be determined

pursuant to a defined mechanism.*° The Agreement provided that the Parties would take all
corporate and statutory steps required to formalize the purchase and sale transaction: Interinvest
was required to provide to Respondent all documents required to formalize the transfers provided
for in the Agreement; Respondent was required to take all steps legally required for the purchase
of Interinvest’s entire stockholding in the Airlines. The Agreement provided for a 60 day transition
period to formalize the purchase and sale, during which time a transition board would manage the
operations of the Airlines (Article 3). Each party to the Agreement would appoint two members to
sit on the Transition Board, which would be presided over by a General Manager appointed by
Argentina, who would monitor the Airlines’ operation and be in charge of their daily management
(Article 3). Article 4 of the Agreement provided a list of things to be completed by the parties
within the 60-day period, and Article 5 provided that the parties would prepare an income
statement and balance sheet for the Airlines as of July 17, 2008, the date on which the Transition

Board would come into operation.

779. Article 6 of the Agreement spells out the specific mechanism by which the parties agreed

to set the sale price for the Airlines’ shares. In full, Article 6 provides:

(i) The purchase price for AUSTRAL’s [AUSA’s] stock interest shall be determined based on the
valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by [Interinvest] and the valuation
to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA.

(ii) The purchase price for AEROL{NEAS’ [ARSA’s] stock interest shall be determined based on
the valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by [Interinvest] and the
valuation to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA.

The STATE OF ARGENTINA shall seek the abovementioned valuations from the Appraisal Board,
which agency shall assess the value of the airlines as a whole.

Should the valuations thus performed yield different results and/or if an agreement cannot be
otherwise reached as to the price of the two stock interests, a third valuation shall be sought from
an impartial local or foreign entity of international renown specialized in the purchase and sale
and/or valuation of international airlines; the valuation thus obtained shall be final and definitive as
between the Parties.

The valuation shall be performed using the discounted cash flow method. Such future cash flows
shall be calculated using the following assumptions: (i) the cost of fuel at its current subsidized value
of $1.85 (one Argentine peso and eighty-five cents) per liter plus VAT; said price is to be changed
using reference prices and proportionately to price variations in the market; and (ii) the current fare
for domestic flights, modified proportionately to any changes projected for all other costs.

780. The July 2008 Agreement was signed at a public event on July 17, 2008 by Secretary Jaime
on behalf of Respondent and by the representative of the Interinvest S.A. Group,
Mr. Eduardo Aranda. The Agreement provided that it would be ratified by the Federal Minister
of Planning and by Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias on July 21, 2008.4° As agreed, the
July 2008 Agreement was then ratified on July 21 by Federal Minister of Planning De Vido, the

Spanish Ambassador to Argentina, Mr. Estrella, and Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias.

781. There was a dispute between the Parties’ legal experts on the nature of the July 2008
Agreement. Respondent’s expert, Professor Mata, opined that the July 2008 Agreement was a
form of preliminary or “preparatory” agreement for the purchase and sale of the shares. He also
maintained that there was no specific obligation in the Agreement for Interinvest to sell its shares
nor for the Government to purchase them. Rather, he agreed to the suggestion that Interinvest
could have decided not to sell or the Government of Argentina could have decided not to buy the
shares.°47 On the other hand, Claimants’ expert, Professor Bianchi, was of the view that the July
2008 Agreement was binding in nature and provided Interinvest with the vested right to sell the
shares of the Airlines by means of a sale contract at a price to be defined by an agreed

mechanism.™"®

782. Inthe Tribunal’s view, the July 2008 Agreement constituted a binding agreement between
Interinvest and the Government of Argentina pursuant to which the two parties agreed to the
purchase and sale of Interinvest’s shares in the Airlines on the terms set out in the Agreement.
Whether a further, formalized purchase and sale agreement was envisioned by the Parties does not
affect the binding nature of the commitments contained in the July 2008 Agreement. The Parties
to the agreement agreed to the purchase and sale of the Airlines on certain terms.”*? The July 2008
Agreement came in to full force and effect upon ratification by the Government’s Minister of

Federal Planning, Mr. De Vido, on July 21, 2008. Further, as of that date, the Parties commenced

Airlines provided certain conditions were met. See Transcript p. 633. Mr. Llorens also accepted that the Agreement

the implementation of the July 2008 Agreement with the appointment of the Transition Committee
and the Interim General Manager, Mr. Alak. As will be discussed further below, the Parties
generally comported themselves in a manner that indicated that they considered themselves bound

by the agreement well into November of 2008.

783. The Tribunal has noted some disagreement between the Parties’ legal experts as to whether
there was a requirement that the July 2008 Agreement be approved by Congress.
Professor Bianchi was of the view that the agreement became fully effective upon formal
ratification by Minister De Vido and that if the agreement was subsequently submitted for
Congressional approval, this was a political decision by the Executive. In his opinion, the purchase
of a company, in this case of the shares of the Airlines, is administrative matter which fell within
the scope of authority of the Executive.’ On the other hand, Professor Mata was of the view that
the approval of Congress was required since the privatization of ARSA had been approved by an
act of Congress. According to him, the acquisition of the shares of the Airlines entailed reversing
the privatization as well as the Government of Argentina’s re-assumption of the corporate
decision-making power over the Airlines, both of which required the approval of Congress.
Further, according to Professor Mata, the purchase of the Airlines’ shares implied the need for
earmarking within the national budget which required the consideration and approval of

Congress.°*!

In the Tribunal’s view, whether Congress’ approval was required for the
implementation of the purchase of the Airlines does not affect the binding nature of the

commitments made by the Government of Argentina in the July 2008 Agreement.

784. In this regard, the agreement does not expressly provide for approval by Congress before
it was to come into effect. Rather, Article 2 of the Agreement provides that Respondent was
required to “take [all] the steps legally required for the purchase of [Interinvest’s] entire
stockholding in Aerolineas and Austral.” After having been signed by the Secretary of

Transportation on July 21, 2008, the Agreement was ratified by the Federal Minister of Planning,

950 Bianchi ERI {{ 49-50; Transcript pp. 602-604. He also disagreed with Professor Mata that a law approving the
Agreement was required because ARSA had been privatized by way of a statute adopted by Congress or because the
amount to be paid for the transaction had to be reflected in the budget. See Bianchi ERI 4 50; Transcript pp. 602-603.

Claimants and the Spanish Ambassador to Argentina. In these circumstances, the Tribunal
concludes that the Government of Argentina bound itself to the provisions of the July 2008
Agreement without the condition of approval by Congress. In any event, Respondent accepts that

Law No. 26,412 approved the July 2008 Agreement, albeit with some modifications.**

785. Claimants assert that at the same time the July 2008 Agreement was signed, Interinvest
also signed a “List of Non-Contractual Arrangements” with the Government.” According to
Claimants, this Side Agreement was necessary because the executives of the Airlines “had been
the object of persecution in the courts and in the media” and they wanted to ensure that once the

Airlines were sold, “the judicial persecution would cease.”°** This “List” provides as follows:

Stay of all court actions. Immediate.
Upon the signing of the agreement, all court actions will be dropped.

Signing of the Agreement: On Monday 21, before the ambassador to Spain (who will also be
signing), the Argentine Minister, and the executing parties.

Oral agreement that there will be no political, media or court persecution and that upon the execution
of all final documents, the broadest statutory guarantees will be given.°°>

786. Respondent strenuously denies that this “extra contractual arrangement” was a part of the

July 2008 Agreement and asserts that the alleged signatory was not a State representative.?*°

787. It appears that the Side Agreement was signed on July 16, 2008 and that one of the
signatures was by Mr. Gutiérrez at whose offices the Parties met on that date.°°’ It does not appear
that Mr. Gutiérrez was acting in any formal capacity as Respondent’s representative. However,

the evidence indicates that he was involved as a de facto agent or facilitator on behalf of

Respondent in respect of both the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement.?**
Although the Side Agreement is not formally referred to in the July 2008 Agreement, nor expressly
appended to that agreement as an exhibit, it does appear to have been signed contemporaneously
with the agreement and lists at least one agreed term relating to the July 2008 Agreement: signature
of the July 2008 Agreement on July 21“ with the presence and signature by the Spanish

Ambassador to Argentina.*°?

788. Each of the Parties accuses the other of breaching the July 2008 Agreement. For their part,
Claimants say that Respondent effectively repudiated the agreement by failing to simply submit it
for approval by the Argentine Congress and, instead, filing a bill for a “repossession” or “rescate”
law. In addition, they say that the lengthy Presidential message which introduced the rescate bill
contained a variety of false statements and many negative remarks in an attempt to generate a
strong reaction from Congress against Claimants and the July 2008 Agreement. Further,
Claimants say that Law No. 26,412, which approved Respondent’s “repossession” or “rescate” of
the Airlines, referred only to calculation of compensation for the purchase of the shares by the
TTN and made no reference to the July 2008 Agreement or the valuation methodology contained

in the agreement.

789. Claimants also say that after the adoption of Law No. 26,412 in September 2008,
Respondent continued to act in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner by acting as if it were
abiding by the July 2008 Agreement while, at the same time, repudiating it. They say that
Respondent maintained discussions and meetings with them (primarily relating to the valuation

submitted by Claimants) in the pretense that it was going to enforce and comply with the July 2008

Agreement. However, Claimants say that Respondent did not do this and effectively took control
of the Airlines in November 2008 and subsequently expropriated the shares in the Airlines in
December 2008. Claimants say that this conduct violated the FET standard in a number of ways,
in particular the requirements that Respondent act transparently and consistently towards
Claimants’ investment, that it respect Claimants’ legitimate expectations and rights and that it act

in good faith.*°!

790. Claimants also say that Respondent breached the July 2008 Agreement by failing to
conduct the valuation pursuant to Article 6 of the Agreement in accordance with the DCF
methodology agreed. According to Claimants, the DCF valuation that was prepared for

Respondent by the TTN did not adopt the terms of the July 2008 Agreement.”

791. In addition, and in any event, Claimants say that since Credit Suisse’s valuation and TTN’s
valuation differed, the Parties were obliged to appoint a third, independent valuator in accordance
with Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. However, Respondent refused to do so despite
Claimants’ repeated requests. Claimants maintain that to justify this refusal, Respondent raised a
number of invalid objections, including, inter alia, that: the Credit Suisse valuation did not bear a
holographic signature and was not apostilled; it lacked information to properly asses the Credit
Suisse valuation and the Airlines in general; and Marsans Group/Interinvest had failed to submit
a draft 2007 balance sheet sufficiently in advance of the shareholders’ meeting called to approve

it. Claimants say that, for a number of reasons, these objections were not valid.

792. Further, Claimants say that although the Transition Committee’s powers and term should
have expired on October 14, 2008, Respondent continued to control the Airlines through the

General Manager, Mr. Alak, appointed under the July 2008 Agreement. When Claimants

°© According to Claimants, the TTN’s DCF valuation assumed only 5 years of cash flows and terminal value for the
Airlines; applied discount rates in ARS to cash flows in USD; did not adjust airfares in proportion to cost increases.
See, for example, Cl. PHB 130. The Tribunal notes that the TTN’s primary basis for valuation was an asset valuation:
see TTN’s valuation dated October 10, 2008: C-204. Claimants also say that under its DCF valuation, the TTN had
valued AUSA at USD 79 million, but arbitrarily concluded that since ARSA had a negative value that exceeded
AUSA’s positive valuation, no compensation was due to Claimants for AUSA: Cl. PHB {] 131.

General Manager, Respondent requested and obtained an injunction preventing any change in the

Board of Directors or the removal of Mr. Alak.°

793. For its part, Respondent says that Law No. 26,412 was not inconsistent with the July 2008
Agreement nor did it render it invalid. It says that the Law authorized the executive branch of
government to enter into a share purchase agreement and that after the enactment of the Law, it
continued to make its best efforts to ensure the requirements and conditions set forth in the

Agreement were met.*®

794. In this regard, Respondent says that Claimants failed to provide the financial information
required under the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. Specifically, Respondent says that the Credit
Suisse valuation submitted by Claimants was not properly signed, nor was it independent. Further,
Respondent says that Claimants failed or refused to provide all of the necessary information to
assess the Credit Suisse valuation and therefore it could not consider the valuation as an appraisal

under Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement.°

795. Respondent also says that Claimants failed to comply with the requirement in the July 2008
Agreement regarding the preparation of income statements and balance sheets for the Airlines as
at December 31, 2007 and July 17, 2008. It says that the statements provided were only unaudited,

Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement and to provide adequate financial information, it was not

possible to proceed with the purchase contemplated by the July 2008 Agreement.

Further, in view of the valuation by the TTN, the findings of the National Audit Office regarding
the state of the Airlines and the alleged failure of Claimants to meet their obligations under the

which declared that the shares of the Airlines and of their subsidiaries were for the public interest

and subject to expropriation.°”°

Law No. 26,412

798. OnJuly 24, 2008, the Argentine Executive submitted the July 2008 Agreement for approval
to Congress. Along with the Memorandum of Agreement itself, Respondent submitted a bill for

“repossession” (rescate) along with an introduction.*”!

statements regarding Claimants’ management of the Airlines.°”* They also point to a statement
made by Secretary of Transportation Jaime to the effect that “Aerolineas Argentinas has been
deprived of much. Personally I believe nothing should be paid, but that should be determined by
the public valuation agencies.”°”?

800. Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the Executive’s request for a “bail out” was
necessary for the following reasons: 1) the Airlines were not providing consistent, regular equal
services as required under the Aeronautics Code, 2) they were not ensuring employment for
workers, and 3) they were not maintaining the aircraft and continuity of service.?’* Respondent

public service in question, and that the law itself was “the most suitable mitigating factor to

ensure users the continuity of the provision of the commercial air service.”?”°

801. The Presidential message introducing the bill requesting approval of the July 2008
Agreement contains a number of highly critical comments relating to the management of the
Airlines by its majority shareholders, Air Comet and Interinvest. It alleges, amongst other things,
that they never complied with their commitments to make investments, increase regular flights and
incorporate new aircraft in either domestic or international services. It also states that the serious
situation of the Airlines was due to the deficient management by Marsans Group. It also referred
to alleged repeated failure to comply with agreements with the Government of Argentina and the
failure to comply with operating requirements for routes covered by their concessions, as well as

the failure to meet technical requirements pursuant to the terms of the Air Transportation Code.?””

802. Asnoted previously, on July 29, 2008, Interinvest wrote to the Federal Minister of Planning
and to the Secretary of Transportation to complain that the introductory message contained many
incorrect statements contrary to the interests of Interinvest and its management of the Airlines.
Interinvest also complained that the statements in question were unnecessary for the purpose of
submitting the bill to Congress. On September 16, 2008, Interinvest submitted a lengthy and
detailed document pointing out the many alleged inaccuracies contained in the Presidential

introductory message.°”®

803. In the Tribunal’s view, the message introducing the proposed bill was partial and did not
give a fair account of the reasons for the serious financial conditions of the Airlines. As indicated

above, the Tribunal has found that Respondent has not, for the most part, demonstrated the alleged

°77 See Mufioz Pérez WS2, App. 12. The message was also highly critical of the management of the Airlines prior to

stated that it was in the interest of the State that the final price arrived by application of the provisions in the July 2008
Agreement be subject to approval of Congres:
°"8 Mujioz Pérez WS2, App. 13. Interinvest’s response runs to 44 pages. It addresses, inter alia, the fact that the
Airlines were under the supervision of the Secretariat of Transportation and other authorities which regularly reviewed
their operations and had renewed the Airlines’ concessions. Interinvest also denied that its management of the Airlines
was inadequate and raised the issue of the very significant increase in the costs of the Airlines and the inadequacy of
the airfare increases which did not comply with the TER standard.

poor management of the Airlines. Further, the introductory message took no account of the sharply
increasing costs of the Airlines and the fact that these were only offset to a limited extent by
measures adopted by the Government, nor the poor market conditions faced by the airline industry.
As the Tribunal has found previously, the Government repeatedly acknowledged the crisis faced
by airlines by implementing and continuing a state of emergency in the air transportation sector
and in the various decrees and resolutions implementing airfare increases and proposed tax
measures to assist the industry. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the introductory
message introducing the request for approval of the July 2008 Agreement was not fairly balanced
and could not have been of much, if any, support for the approval of the terms of the July 2008

Agreement.

804. Further, the Tribunal finds that the statement made by the Government representatives to
the committee of Congress considering the bill were also not supportive of the adoption of the July
2008 Agreement. For example, Secretary Jaime was critical of the performance and management
of the Airlines and offered his view that ARSA had been deprived of much and that “obviously, I
consider that nothing should be paid. However, it is the appropriate agencies which will determine
which is the true price to be paid, one or the other. That will be determined by Congress.”°”
Secretary Jaime’s statements were also inconsistent. On occasion he stated that if there was no
agreement on the price, then there would be a third valuation by an international entity. However,
at other times, he stated that the third-party valuation would be binding on the Parties and
unappealable by them, but not on Congress which could decide not to approve the price determined

by the third valuator.°*°

805. The bill submitting the July 2008 Agreement for approval proposes the repossession or
rescate of the Airlines and the approval of the agreement which was attached Annex 1. The bill

provided that the TTN would perform the valuation provided for in Article 6 of the July 2008

9” C-196. “A Aerolineas se le ha sacado mucho. Obviamente, considero que no se debe pagar nada, Pero, son los
organismos que correst aquellos que inardn cudl es el precio que tendré que pagar, uno 0 el

to be submitted to Congress for approval before payment.°*!

806. The Argentine Congress enacted Law No. 26,412 on September 18, 2008, approving the

Government’s “repossession” of the Airlines.**? The law provides, in relevant part:

Lineas Aéreas - Cielos del Sur S.A, and any other company owned by them (Optar S.A., Jet Paq S.A.,
Aerohandling S.A.) by purchasing their capital stock.

      

  
 

SECTION 2- The National Valuation Office shall a fhe companies Aerolineas Argentinas S.A.
and Austral Lineas Aéreas - Cielos del Sur S.A, pursuant to Section | hereof. Valuations will be
carried out taking into consideration the values prevailing as of July 1, 2008. The Joint Committee
of the House and the Senate for State Reform and Privatization Follow Up created under Section 14
of Law 23,696, shall supervise the valuations, ensuring that they take into account the companies’
actual Shareholders’ Equity and that they are in keeping with the technical criteria governing the
activities that those companies are engaged in.

SECTION 3 - The price determined shall be submitted to the Honourable Argentine Congress for
approval...7*°

807. Although Article 1 of Law No. 26,412 provides that the redemption of the shares would be
achieved by way of their purchase, no reference is made to the July 2008 Agreement nor the
methodology contained in it for the determination of the price of the shares. Rather, the only
valuations mentioned were to be performed by the TTN and supervised by the joint committee of

Congress, with the price determined to be subject to congressional approval.

808. The Parties disagree as to whether Law No. 26,412, as enacted, disregarded or breached
the July 2008 Agreement. Claimants assert that, “in a clear breach of the July 2008 Agreement,
Law No. 26,412 did not make any reference to the July 2008 Agreement section establishing that
in case of disagreement between the Parties’ valuations, the price of the Argentine Airlines’ shares
would be set by a third independent and renowned valuation agency.”**4 Instead, the law provided

only that the Tribunal de Tasaciones, the TTN, would calculate the compensation.°°°

809. Respondent asserts, however, that Law No. 26,412 did not disregard or ignore the July
2008 Agreement. To the contrary, it argues the July 2008 Agreement provided in Article 2 that the
Government of Argentina “shall take all steps legally required for the purchase of [Interinvest]’s
entire stockholding in AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.”®*¢ It further argues that Congress was
required to approve the July 2008 Agreement because the share purchase needed to be ear-marked
in the national budget, and also because the Agreement reversed an older law privatizing the

Airlines.°*”

810. Respondent points out, furthermore, that following the enactment of Law No. 26,412, the
Government of Argentina made its best efforts to ensure that the requirements and conditions set

forth in the July 2008 Agreement were met.?**

811. Although Law No. 26,412 did not refer to the July 2008 Agreement nor incorporate the
valuation methodology contained in the agreement, the law was not necessarily inconsistent with
the agreement. There was no express requirement in the July 2008 Agreement for the Government
of Argentina to obtain the approval of Congress, nor for it to set out the valuation methodology for
determining the price of the purchase of the Airlines’ shares. Rather, the Government of
Argentina’s obligation was to take all steps legally required for the purchase of Interinvest’s entire
shareholding in the Airlines. The agreement also required, in Article 6, that the Government of
Argentina should seek the valuations provided for in that article from the TTN. On its face, Law
No. 26,412 provided for valuations of both Airlines by the TTN. In the Tribunal’s view, whether
the valuations were properly conducted by the TTN (or Interinvest) and the subsequent failure to
propose or agree to appoint a third valuator is a separate matter. There was no indication that these
issues were specifically related to Law No. 26,412. As a result, the Tribunal cannot conclude that
Law No. 26,412 itself breached the July 2008 Agreement as alleged by Claimants. Rather, the

relevant question is whether the Parties complied with their obligations under the Agreement to

third valuator to determine the same.

812. The Tribunal notes that it appears common ground between the Parties that the July 2008
Agreement remained in force irrespective of the adoption of Law No. 26,412. As discussed below,
the Parties continued to address the valuations throughout the month of October and into

November 2008.°*?

The valuations of the Airlines

813. After the execution and ratification of the July 2008 Agreement, the Transition Committee
commenced its function and Mr. Alak was appointed the General Manager of the Airlines. At its
first meeting, the Transition Committee set out its duties and those of the General Manager who,
in addition to control of operations and daily management of the Companies under the instructions
of the Transition Committee, was also charged with implementing the necessary actions required
to perfect the purchase and sale agreement which was the subject of the July 2008 Agreement.
Further, at the request of Interinvest, information requests in respect of the Airlines were to be

centralized or channeled through the General Manager.°””

814. By October 14, 2008, valuations had been prepared by both the TTN and Credit Suisse and
exchanged between Interinvest and Respondent. The TTN’s valuation was dated October 9, 2008
and was submitted to Subsecretary Llorens on October 10, 2008.99! The Credit Suisse valuation

was dated October 12, 2008.°°? These two valuations were dramatically different. Credit Suisse’s

in force at the time he wrote his letter of October 30, 2008 and that he was acting consistently with Law No. 26,412:

State confirmed that administrative arrangements had been made so that all document or information requests and
their receipt should be implemented through the General Manager. Further, the State’s representatives indicated that
the teams from the Ministry of Planning, the General Audit Office (AGN) and the Siren would participate in
information requests and t the General Manager. With respect to the valuations of the shares of ARSA and
AUSA, the minutes record that the valuations would be performed by entities appointed by Interinvest and the State
pursuant to the DCF methodology in accordance with Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement and that the members of
the Transition Committee requested that the valuating entities consider that, to the extent possible, the valuations
should be technically comparable. RA-379, p. 2.

valuation for the Airlines ranged between USD 330 million to USD 540 million.”? The TTN’s

valuation found the Airlines to have a negative value of USD 832 million.?”*

815. The Parties have three fundamental disagreements with respect to the valuations. First, they
disagree as to whether the valuation submitted by Interinvest complied with the requirements of
the July 2008 Agreement. As outlined below, Respondent asserts that Claimants breached the
agreement by failing to provide a valid valuation, which it says required a signed and apostilled
independent valuation. Respondent also says that Interinvest failed to provide all of the financial
information it was required to provide such that the TTN could fully analyze the Credit Suisse
valuation. Claimants assert that Respondent had access to all the information and unjustifiably
rejected the Credit Suisse valuation. Second, the Parties disagree as to whether the TTN’s
valuation was independent and in compliance with the Agreement. Third, the Parties accuse each
other of breaching the July 2008 Agreement with respect to the obligation to finalize the Airlines’

financial statements.

816. After receiving Claimants’ Credit Suisse valuation, Undersecretary Llorens*”> requested
on October 15, 2008 that Interinvest submit supporting materials for the Credit Suisse valuation,
specifically with respect to the valuation’s EBITDA, WACC and TIR indexes.*”° Undersecretary
Llorens reiterated this request on October 23, 2008.” On that same day, Interinvest requested the
exhibits supporting the TTN’s first valuation,°”* and these exhibits were provided to Interinvest on

October 27, 2008.°? On October 27, 2008, Interinvest presented supplementary materials.

However, Undersecretary Llorens asserts that these materials were insufficient. 1000

values in ARS. These were submitted as C-380 and C-379, respectively.

817. Concurrent with Undersecretary Llorens’ requests for supplemental materials supporting
the Credit Suisse valuation, he also requested that Interinvest submit a signed copy of the Credit
Suisse valuation that complied with the requirements of the Hague Convention of 1961.!°°!
According to Respondent and Undersecretary Llorens, the Credit Suisse valuation as submitted by
Interinvest did not have a holographic signature.!°°? Undersecretary Llorens asserts that he met
with a representative from Interinvest and a representative from Credit Suisse to discuss the
outstanding issues on October 29, 2008. According to Undersecretary Llorens, the Credit Suisse
representative clarified that the Credit Suisse report was indeed a valuation, but that it should not
be considered to be independent.'°? Respondent points out that Mr. Mujioz Pérez confirmed that
the Credit Suisse valuation was based on the Business Plan prepared by the Board of Directors of

the Marsans Group. !0

818. On October 30, 2008, Undersecretary Llorens sent a letter responding to Interinvest’s
request for the appointment of a third-party independent valuator per the terms of Article 6 of the
July 2008 Agreement.'® In this letter, the Undersecretariat of Legal Affairs asserted that it could
not consider the Credit Suisse documents submitted as an appraisal under Article 6, as Interinvest
and Credit Suisse had not responded to the Undersecretariat’s requests for signatures and
verification. In the letter, Interinvest was warned that it was required to submit the valuation within

48 hours on penalty of breach of the July 2008 Agreement.

819. On November 4, 2008, Interinvest submitted the Credit Suisse valuation “with the
appropriate certifications and authentications under the law governing its execution and the
international certification pursuant to the Apostille system established by The Hague Conference,”

according to Undersecretary Llorens.'° However, Undersecretary Llorens asserts that this

valuation only partially complied with the letters sent by the Undersecretariat of Legal Affairs.!°°7

On November 7, 2008, Undersecretary Llorens issued a letter to Interinvest repeating the request
for specific documentation supporting the Credit Suisse valuation. !* In this letter, Interinvest was
informed of the Undersecretariat’s view that it was not possible to finalize discussion of the
valuations, or to affirm the lack of consensus as to a price for the transfer of shares until Interinvest

satisfied these requests for documents and information. !°?

820. Claimants assert a number of arguments in response to the issues raised by Respondent
through Undersecretary Llorens. First, Claimants argue that although they were unnecessary,
Credit Suisse did in fact provide the signatures and formalities required by the Undersecretariat,
and within a week of its first request.!°!° Second, with respect to the supporting documents
requested by Respondent, Claimants argue that TTN President, Mr. Daniel Martin, conceded that
he had sufficient information to analyze the Credit Suisse valuation.'°!! Third, with respect to the
assertion that Credit Suisse’s valuation was not “independent,” Claimants argue that “the GOA
could have simply disregarded Credit Suisse’s valuation and appointed together with Interinvest a
third independent valuator, as the July 2008 Agreement provided.” !°!? Claimants assert that they
requested in writing the appointment of a third independent valuator at least six times between late

October and mid-November 2008, and that Respondent failed to appoint a third valuator.!°'%

821. Further, Claimants assert that the TTN did not observe the terms agreed to under the July

1014

2008 Agreement with respect to the valuation. The TTN’s primary valuation was not

performed on a DCF basis but, rather, on an asset valuation or liquidation basis. Further, they
assert that the TTN’s DCF valuation i) assumed only five years of cash flows and no terminal

value for the Airlines, ii) applied discount rates in ARS to cash flows in USD, and iii) did not

adjust airfares in proportion to cost increases. Claimants point to testimony given by

Mr. Martin to Congress, in which he stated that “the valuation that we are conducting is different

agency of the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment, and Services, the TTN lacked
independence in conducting its own valuation.!°!’ Finally, Claimants’ legal expert, Dr. Bianchi,
asserts that the TTN lacks the technical standards and rules needed to appraise the shares of going

concerns like the Airlines. '°'®

822. The Parties also disagree over whether Claimants complied with the requirement in the
July 2008 Agreement regarding the preparation of income statements and balance sheets for the
Airlines at December 31, 2007 and July 17, 2008. For its part, Respondent argues that the Marsans
Group did not have available sufficient accounting information to determine the real state of the
Airlines at the time the July 2008 Agreement was executed.'°!? Respondent says that Interinvest,
as majority shareholder in the Airlines, provided only unaudited, incomplete copies of the July 17,
2008 financial statements as required pursuant to Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. °°
Claimants, in response, argue that both the Interim General Manager, Mr. Alak, and the TTN had

access to these statements. !°?!

823. Commencing with Respondent’s allegations that the Credit Suisse valuation did not
comply with the requirements of the July 2008 Agreement, the Tribunal has concluded that these
are not valid. In relation to Respondent’s complaint that the Credit Suisse valuation was not signed
and apostilled, the Tribunal notes that neither was required by the terms of the July 2008
Agreement. In any event, Credit Suisse explained that it does not normally sign its valuation

reports and, in any event, confirmed at a meeting on October 29, 2008 their authorship of the

valuation report.!°?? Further, Credit Suisse then submitted a signed and apostilled version of its

valuation report. !°?>

824. As concerns Respondent’s position that the Credit Suisse valuation was not independent,
the Tribunal again notes that there was no requirement in the July 2008 Agreement that the
valuations performed by the Parties were to be “independent”. Evidence in the record
demonstrates that Interinvest had requested the assistance of Credit Suisse earlier in 2008 to assist
it with a valuation of the Airlines when Interinvest had been approached by Mr. Llorente regarding
the purchase of the Airlines (January 2008) and in respect of the May 2008 Agreement.'°* In
these circumstances, it seems logical for Interinvest to have had recourse, again, to Credit Suisse
when it required a valuation pursuant to the July 2008 Agreement terms. In the Tribunal’s view,
the fact that Credit Suisse had previously performed services for Interinvest did not disqualify it
as an appropriate entity for the valuation of the Airlines’ shares pursuant to Article 6 of the July
2008 Agreement. Similarly, the TTN’s relationship with Respondent on the basis of lack of

independence does not disqualify it as an appropriate entity for the valuation of the Airlines.

825. Insofar as Respondent alleges that the Credit Suisse valuation was not independent in the
sense that Credit Suisse did not independently verify or audit the documents and information used
for the purposes of its valuation, the Tribunal finds that this was neither required by the July 2008
Agreement, nor was it practical. Further, Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement specified certain
agreed parameters for a DCF valuation and Respondent did not object to the Credit Suisse
valuation on that basis. In any event, neither of the valuations prepared by Credit Suisse and the
TTN were binding on the Parties. Either Party was entitled to disagree with the valuation provided

by the other Party and proceed to valuation from “...an impartial, local or foreign entity of

international renown specialized in the purchase and sale and/or valuation of international

airlines.” By agreement of the Parties, that valuation was agreed to be “final and definitive” as

between the Parties (July 2008 Agreement, Article 6). In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent’s

complaints regarding the Credit Suisse valuation were highly formal and artificial.

826. Turning to the question of whether Respondent and the TTN had sufficient information to
assess the value of ARSA and AUSA, the Tribunal concludes that they did, in fact, have sufficient
information and that Respondent’s complaints with respect to what was provided by Interinvest
do not amount to a breach by Claimants of the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. In addressing

this question, it is important to bear in mind the context leading up to the adoption of the agreement.

827. In this regard, as a shareholder and through its representation on the Board of Directors,
Respondent had challenged the financial statements of ARSA for the years 2002 through 2005
and, as described above, eventually approved those statements as part of the June 2006 Agreement.
By way of this process, Respondent must have had considerable information and familiarity with
ARSA’s financial statements and financial situation more generally. Further, by way of the June
2006 Agreement, the Government of Argentina appointed a second member of the Board of
Directors of ARSA and appointed a member to ARSA’s audit committee. As a result, in the words
of Mr. Llorens, after the June 2006 Agreement, Respondent “started to participate in the day-to-
day operations of the Company.”!° Further, the May 2008 Agreement involved the production
of three different valuations of AUSA by international valuation firms and must have provided
considerable additional information in that context. Finally, upon the appointment of the
Transition Committee and Mr. Alak as the Interim General Manager, Respondent had broad access
to the information of the Airlines. As noted previously, all requests for information from
Respondent and its various entities were channeled through Mr. Alak as Interim General Manager
of the Airlines. The evidence also indicates that Interinvest did produce, and make available,

information in response to the Respondent’s requests.

828. A review of the evidence indicates that the TTN was able to assess Credit Suisse’s
valuation. This is reflected in the minutes of the meeting held between the TTN and Credit Suisse

on October 29, 2008 and, in particular, the TTN’s supplemental report dated November 12, 2008

in which it confirmed its valuation and addressed Interinvest’s complaints regarding the TTN
valuation and critiqued Credit Suisse’s valuation.!°6 In addition, Mr. Martin accepted in his

testimony that the TTN was able to analyze the Credit Suisse valuation and provide its views on
it, 1027

829. For these reasons, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants breached the July 2008
Agreement by failing to provide a valid valuation or by failing to provide the financial information

required such that the TTN and Respondent could adequately analyze the Credit Suisse valuation.

830. Turning to Claimants’ argument that the TTN valuation was not in accordance with the
terms of the July 2008 Agreement, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this has been made out.
While it appears that Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement provides that all of the valuations were
to be conducted on a DCF basis and the TTN’s primary valuation was not conducted on that basis,
the TTN, nevertheless, conducted a DCF valuation which it set out in its report of October 10,
2008.'°28 Claimants assert that the DCF valuation performed by the TTN was not carried out in
accordance with the terms of the July 2008 Agreement for a number of reasons.'°”? These include
the fact that the TTN’s analysis assumed only five years of cash flows and no terminal value for
the Airlines; applied discount rates in ARS to cash flows in USD; and did not adjust airfares in
proportion to cost increases. These criticisms of the TTN’s DCF valuation appear to be valid and
would affect the reliability of that valuation. However, they do not in themselves amount to a
breach of the July 2008 Agreement. In the Tribunal’s view, the issues between the Parties in
respect of these matters are what was intended to be resolved by the third valuator to be appointed
under Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. Further, as expressed above, the Agreement did not

require that the valuations prepared and submitted by the Parties be independent.

or patrimonial value (valor sustantivo o patrimonial) and valued the Companies’ assets and liabilities at market value.
It also explained why the DCF methodology was not appropriate. It also explained that it had performed a second
valuation on the basis of cash flows for five years and a discount rate of 15.6% (pp. 25-27).

831. Finally, the Tribunal addresses Respondent’s argument that Interinvest failed to provide an
audited income statement and balance sheet for the Airlines as at July 17, 2008.!%° In the

Tribunal’s view, this does not amount to a breach of the July 2008 Agreement.

832. Pursuant to Article 5 of the July 2008 Agreement, the Parties were to prepare an income
statement and balance sheet for ARSA and AUSA as of July 17, 2008 and once those statements
had been prepared and audited (within the 60-day transition period) the Parties were to review and
approve these. Article 5 also provides that the financial statements in question were to be approved
by the shareholders of ARSA and AUSA pursuant to the relevant statutory procedures. At the
outset, the Tribunal notes that the obligation contained in Article 5 of the July 2008 Agreement is
upon the Parties to the Agreement, not solely on Interinvest. Further, although the July 17, 2008
statements were not audited, it appears that drafts of the statements had been circulated by August
28, 2008 when Mr. Alak, the Interim General Manager appointed under the July 2008 Agreement,

appeared before Congress. !°?!

833. At the ARSA shareholders’ meeting of November 12, 2008, the July 17, 2008 financial
statements were approved by the majority of the shareholders although the statements had not been
audited. The approval of the statements was opposed by the representatives of the Class “A”

shares (the Government of Argentina) and the Class “B” shares (employee shareholdings). !°°?

834. Although the July 17, 2008 financial statements had not been audited prior to their
approval, the evidence indicates that they had been circulated, together with the 2007 financial
statements, prior to August 28, 2008. Further, as described above, the TTN was able to analyze

and comment on the Credit Suisse valuation despite the lack of audited financial statements at July

1030 Resp. PHB J 161. Respondent submits that ARSA’s auditors, PwC, did not sign the July 17, 2008 statements and
the Board did not retain another firm to replace PwC and provide the audited statements. It also submits that the
financial statements were approved by the Board, without any audit in November 2008: see the minutes of the ARSA

Although the 2007 financial statements had not been studied by the Board of Directors, they had been submitted to
the State’s General Audit Office (AGN) for its review and the AGN was in the process of reviewing them.

17, 2008. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the lack of audited financial
statements at July 17, 2008 constituted a breach of the July 2008 Agreement by Claimants. In this
regard, the Tribunal notes that the Parties did not strictly enforce all of the terms of the July 2008
Agreement. For example, the 60-day transition period appears to have expired on or about October
14, 2008.!°3 Nevertheless, the Parties continued discussions of their respective valuations and

considered that the Agreement remained in effect. !°*

835. The Tribunal’s review of the evidence indicates that the Credit Suisse and TTN valuations
were very different and there was an impasse between the Parties on reaching agreement on the
price to be paid for the shares of ARSA and AUSA. In these circumstances, the appointment of a
third valuator to determine the price of the shares was appropriate and required. Clearly, the
valuations yielded different results and, in addition, it was plain that agreement could not be
reached as to the price of the shares, as provided in Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. In these
circumstances, Interinvest requested the appointment of a third, independent valuator a number of

times, commencing on October 29, 2008. 1035

Management of the Airlines and the Injunction

836. In its letter of November 12, 2008 to the Minister of Planning and the Secretary of
Transportation, Interinvest complained that since October 8, 2008, Respondent’s appointees to the
Transition Committee had not attended any meetings, although duly invited to do so. As a result,
the Transition Committee did not have a sufficient quorum to provide directions to the General
Manager appointed under the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. Despite this, the Interim General

Manger had continued to manage the Airlines. As a result, Interinvest requested an urgent meeting

1033 Tt appears that on the basis of working days counted from July 21, 2008 when the Agreement was formally ratified,
60 days expired on or about October 14, 2008.

of the Transition Committee. Interinvest also requested that Respondent proceed with the selection

of a third valuator. !°°

837. At the Board of Directors meeting of ARSA on November 19, 2008, representatives of
Interinvest raised the question of Mr. Alak’s continuation as General Manager without the
supervision of the Transition Committee which had not met since October 8, 2008 due to the failure
of the Government of Argentina’s representatives to attend the meetings of the Committee. The
representatives of Interinvest stated that this constituted a breach of the terms of the July 2008
Agreement and that the General Manager had proceeded to adopt important measures relating to
the Airlines without the authorization of the Transition Committee. In addition, Mr. Aranda
Unzurrunzaga stated that it had been reported that the Minister of Planning had stated to the press
that there would be no third valuator and that it was Congress which had the final word in
determining the price of the shares under the July 2008 Agreement. In light of these events,
Mr. Aranda proposed that the same powers of General Manager held by Mr. Alak should be given
to the Assistant General Manager, Mr. Molina, and that the General Manger could only act jointly
with the Assistant General Manager until the Government of Argentina clarified its position with
respect to the continuing effect of, and compliance with, the July 2008 Agreement. Mr. Alak
objected to the resolution as it was not on the agenda for the meeting. After some discussion, the
Board agreed to call another meeting on November 25, 2008 to discuss the proposal of

Mr. Aranda.!%7

838. On November 21, 2008, an Argentine court issued a preliminary injunction ordering that:
1) the current membership of the Airline’s board of directors not be modified; 2) Mr. Julio Alak
continue as the Airlines’ Interim General Manager and as a director of ARSA; and 3) a comptroller
(interventor judicial veedor e informante) be appointed to oversee the operations of the Airlines

and provide a report to the court.!°*

839. According to Claimants, this injunction “was obviously aimed at harassing the airlines’

directors and at consolidating the GOA’s de facto control[.}”!°*

840. According to Respondent’s witness, Undersecretary Llorens, precautionary measures were
justifiable to ensure the continuity of service and to protect the Airlines from an uncertain
future. '°° Undersecretary Llorens states that, in the wake of the injunction,

At this stage, based on the appraisal performed by the Argentine Valuation Board, which had yielded

a negative value for the companies, and the company’s dilatory and reluctant behavior in terms of

the discussion and analysis of the appraisal, it could only be concluded that it was no longer feasible

to purchase the companies pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement of July 2008, and
expropriation was the only step to be taken in order to safeguard the public service involved. !™!

Law No. 26,466

841. On the same date the injunction was issued, November 21, 2008, members of the House of
Representatives submitted a draft bill to the Congress with a view to expropriating Claimants’
investment.!°42 On December 22, 2008, the Senate passed Law No. 26,466, authorizing the
expropriation of the Airline’s shares.!° In Article 1 of Law No. 26,466, the Senate and Chamber
of Deputies declare as “public utility and subject to expropriation” the shares of ARSA and AUSA
and their controlled entities Optar S.A., Jet Paq S.A. and Aerohandling S.A. Article 1 also
designates the TTN to perform the valuation of the Airlines pursuant to Law No. 21,499

(“Argentine Expropriation Law”).

842. On December 30, 2008, Decree 2347/2008 was enacted, establishing the Ministry of
Federal Planning as the entity charged with carrying out the expropriation under Law No. 26,466.
Under the terms of Decree 2347/2008, the Government of Argentina shall “exercise any and all
rights granted by the shares to be expropriated” starting from the date of publication of the law and

was to be done by an administrative entity created in the decree and consisting of four members
named by the Government, including Mr. Alak. According to Claimants, the practical implication
of this was that Claimants continued to hold the title to their shares in the Airlines, through their

subsidiaries, but were unable to exercise any control over the Airlines through these shares. !°4°

843. In accordance with Law No. 26,466, Law No. 21,499 and Decree 2347/08, Respondent
sent Interinvest the TTN’s updated valuation of the Airlines’ shares, in the amount of negative
ARS 3,087,748,413!° on January 15, 2009. This valuation, which provided an even greater
negative valuation of the Airlines than the TTN’s prior valuations, was, according to Respondent’ s
expert and TTN President, Mr. Martin, due to the difference in valuation with two additional
aircraft that were not in operation.'“7 Argentina offered a token ARS 1.00 in compensation for

the expropriation.

844. Respondent requested Interinvest to inform it, within five days of being served, whether it
accepted that valuation. On January 21, 2009, Interinvest rejected the TTN’s valuation.!* The
Parties then proceeded to court via the procedures set forth in the Expropriation Law (Law No.

Conclusions on the July 2008 Agreement and Subsequent Events

845. As outlined above, Claimants assert that in breach of the FET standard in the Treaty,
Respondent repudiated the July 2008 Agreement. They say that that Argentina’s violation of the
Agreement in and of itself constitutes a breach of the FET standard because it: breached a
sovereign contractual commitment that Claimants had relied on; undermined the transparency of

the divestment process in which the Government pressured Claimants to engage; and demonstrated

bad faith due Respondent’s disregard of its commitment to rely on a third-party valuation expert
in order to limit the compensation payable to Claimants for the expropriation of the shares of the

1050

Airlines to an absurdly low number. Claimants also allege that Respondent’s conduct

following the adoption of the July 2008 Agreement was arbitrary, ambiguous and lacked

transparency. !°>!

Claimants also say that under the pretense of complying with the July 2008
Agreement, Respondent engaged in a dilatory strategy while, in reality, repudiating the Agreement
by failing to implement the agreed valuation methodology for the purchase of the Airlines’ shares
and effectively taking control of the Airlines and proceeding with the expropriation of their

shares. !°52

846. Respondent denies having breached the terms of the July 2008 Agreement in any way.
Rather, it says that despite breaches of the Agreement by Interinvest, including the failure to
provide the information required under the terms of the Agreement and a valid valuation, it
continued making every effort to ensure the successful conclusion of the process initiated under
the Agreement.'°™ It says that at the time the July 2008 Agreement was executed, the accounting
information available made it impossible to know the real state of affairs of the Airlines. It says
that as the process under the July 2008 Agreement advanced, it discovered the catastrophic state
of the Airlines. !°>4 In these circumstances, Respondent says that the performance of the July 2008
Agreement became impossible to fulfill, for reasons not attributable to it. Accordingly, the only
viable alternative in order to maintain the provision of air transportation service was to proceed

with expropriation pursuant to Law No. 26,466. !05

847. As described above, the Parties exchanged valuations pursuant to the terms of the July
2008 Agreement. While Respondent alleged a number of deficiencies in the Credit Suisse
valuation, it had adequate information to assess it and, in fact, did analyze it. The valuations were

clearly very different and the Parties were unable to agree on a price for the purchase of the

Airlines’ shares. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal has found that Respondent ’s criticisms
and allegations that Interinvest was in breach of the July 2008 Agreement are unfounded. As a
result, the next appropriate step under the terms of the Agreement was for the Parties to proceed
with the appointment of a third valuator to determine the price at which the shares of the Airlines

were to be purchased.

848. Rather than proceeding in this manner, Respondent continued to object to the Credit Suisse
valuation and a number of disputes arose between Interinvest and Respondent at the level of both
the Board of Directors and at shareholders meetings. Instead of proceeding with valuation of the
shares by an independent third valuator pursuant to Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement,
Respondent proceeded by way of an injunction appointing a comptroller (veedor) to oversee the
Airlines and to maintain Mr. Alak as the General Manger of the Airlines. This was followed by
the expropriation of the Airlines by way of Law No. 26,466. Pursuant to the terms of that law, the
valuation of the Airlines was to be conducted on an entirely different basis than had been provided

for under the July 2008 Agreement for the determination of the price of the Airlines’ shares.

849. Having carefully reviewed all of the relevant evidence and the Parties’ arguments, the
Tribunal has concluded that in proceeding as it did, Respondent failed to comply with the July
2008 Agreement and the commitments given by it in that agreement. In the Tribunal’s view, this

amounted to a breach of the FET standard.

850. As the Tribunal has found, the July 2008 Agreement was a binding contract between the
Government of Argentina and Interinvest S.A., executed and ratified by authorized signatories for
each of those parties. It provides for the purchase and sale of the shares in the Airlines and defines
the mechanism for determining the key element of the Agreement, the determination of the price
at which the shares were to be purchased. The Agreement provides that the transition period of
60 days was for the purpose of formalizing the purchase and sale of the stock that was the subject
matter of the Agreement. Although the transition period of 60 days appears to have expired on or
about October 14, 2008, the Parties continued performing under the Agreement by continuing their
discussions regarding their respective valuations in an attempt to reach agreement on the sale price

of the shares. Neither Party purported to terminate the Agreement and, indeed, the conduct of both

294

Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.

Award

of the Parties reflected an understanding that the Agreement remained in full force and effect until

at least mid-November 2008.!°°

851. In the Tribunal’s view, the July 2008 Agreement was binding on both Parties. There was
no express condition that the Agreement was subject to the approval of the Argentine Congress.
The Tribunal is unable to accept Respondent’s argument that the reference in Article 2 of the
Agreement that the Government of Argentina “...shall take all steps legally required for the
purchase of [Interinvest]’s entire stockholding in Aerolineas and Austral” subjected the agreement
or the determination of the price for the purchase of the shares to the approval of Congress. Rather,
Article 2 of the agreement requires the Government of Argentina to take all the steps legally
required to complete the purchase of the shares. Article 6 of the agreement clearly states that the
third valuation to be sought from an impartial entity “... shall be final and definitive as between

the Parties.”

852. The Tribunal has carefully considered Respondent’s argument that at the time it executed
and ratified the July 2008 Agreement, it had insufficient information regarding the true state of the
affairs of the Airlines and that it was only after the TTN conducted its valuations that it discovered
the true situation of the Airlines such that the purchase and sale of the shares became unviable.
The Tribunal is unable to accept this argument. Since the June 2006 Agreement, Respondent had
two representatives on the Board of Directors of ARSA and one representative on its audit
committee and, in the words of Mr. Llorens, it began to participate in the daily affairs of ARSA.
Further, from that time forward, Interinvest and the Airlines had written to, and met with, the
Secretariat of Transportation, as well as other Government entities, regarding the difficult financial
circumstances of the Airlines and the need to implement airfare increases and other measures to

help them cover their costs. This difficult situation was repeatedly reflected in the various decrees

1056 Tn this regard, the Tribunal notes that at the meeting of the Board of Directors of ARSA on November 19, 2008,
Mr. Alak submitted a report to the Board regarding suggested improvements in ARSA’s internal controls and
information systems. Mr. Alak also reported that with respect to the National Audit Office all of its requirements to
date had been met, except for some documentation which would be provided the following day. See the Board Minutes
at C-212, pp. 28-29. Later during the course of the meeting, one of Interinvest’s appointees to the Board, Mr. Aranda,
raised the ie of the State’s compliance with the terms of the July 2008 Agreement in light of Mr. Alak’s continued
function as General Manager of the Airlines despite the fact that the Transition Committee had not met since October
8, 2008. As described above, after some di: sion, a decision was made to schedule a new meeting of the Board to
discuss this issue on November 25, 2008.

and resolutions adopted, including the continuation of the state of emergency in the air
transportation sector by Decree 1012/2006. Of particular note are Interinvest’s letters of March
26 and April 29, 2008, referred to above at paragraphs 412, 514 and 515, in which the very difficult
circumstances of the Airlines were set out in detail. After this, the Parties entered into the
May 2008 Agreement pursuant to which the Parties agreed to a reallocation of the capital stock of

the Airlines. !°7

853. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to accept that Respondent did not have access
to sufficient information and was unaware of the state of the Airlines when it signed the July 2008
Agreement. The Tribunal also notes that the Government of Argentina made the first two
contributions to ARSA’s capital to cover wages and other expenses and made its submission to
the court handling ARSA’s continuing insolvency proceedings prior to signing and ratifying the

July 2008 Agreement.

854. The Tribunal has also considered Respondent’s argument that not every breach of contract
by a State constitutes a violation of the duty of fair and equitable treatment.'°* The Tribunal
accepts this proposition.!°°° However, the July 2008 Agreement was not simply a commercial
agreement and, in the Tribunal’s view, Respondent failed to comply with an essential element of
that agreement. As described previously, the July 2008 Agreement was signed and ratified by the
Government of Argentina. Further, as reflected in the preamble and in Respondent’s arguments
and evidence throughout these proceedings, Respondent’s purpose for entering into the July 2008
Agreement was to fulfill its public obligation to guarantee the provision and continuity of air
transportation services in Argentina. In order to affect that purpose, it agreed to a specific

mechanism to determine the purchase price for all of Interinvest’s shares in the Airlines, which

1057 The May 2008 Agreement is entitled “Framework Agreement between the Owners of the Air Comet - Interinvest
Group and the Argentine State in connection with the Viability of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas
Aéreas - Cielos del Sur S.A. and the Allocation of their Capital Stock”. The Agreement also provided that Respondent
would increase its direct interest in the shares of ARSA and that the employees of the Company could hold up to a
maximum of 10% of the stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the price to be paid for the increase in the
capital stock of ARSA was to be fixed on the basis of the average of the appraisals conducted by the three consulting
firms identified in the Agreement.

1059 The Tribunal notes that the issue discussed here is different from the question of the breach of an umbrella clause,
which is discussed separately below.

represented the Claimants’ entire investment. The July 2008 Agreement was intended to put an
end to the long and difficult relationship between Respondent and Interinvest, Air Comet and the
Marsans Group. In the Tribunal’s view, the July 2008 Agreement was not a simple commercial

agreement.

855. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Interinvest and Claimants legitimately
expected Respondent to comply with its commitment to purchase all of the shares in the Airlines
at the price determined by the agreed mechanism in Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. The
Parties commenced performance under the terms of the agreement and Respondent sought to
enforce its terms by insisting on the production of Interinvest’s valuation in the appropriate format
and what it maintained was the required supporting information. Further, although Law No.
26,412 did not specifically refer to the July 2008 Agreement, Respondent consistently maintained
that the law enabled it to proceed with the purchase of the shares and to comply with the July 2008
Agreement. It was not until some point in November 2008 that Respondent apparently decided
that the July 2008 Agreement was not viable and decided to proceed by way of expropriation

without notice to Interinvest or Claimants.

856. In the Tribunal’s view, this conduct amounts to a breach of the FET standard. In addition,
the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s conduct, described above, in relation to the introductory
message and bill seeking approval of the July 2008 Agreement, the adoption of Law No. 26,412,
the objections as to the form the Credit Suisse valuation, the injunction appointing a comptroller
over the Airlines, the maintenance of Mr. Alak as General Manager of the Airlines and the decision

to proceed by expropriation lacked transparency and was arbitrary.

857. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s conduct in failing to comply with its
commitment under the July 2008 Agreement to proceed with the purchase of Interinvest’s shares
in the Airlines on the basis of the agreed mechanism contained in the agreement breached the FET

standard in the Treaty.

6. Assumption of Obligations under the Airbus Purchase Orders

858. The Tribunal has considered Claimants’ arguments relating to Respondent’s alleged breach
of the FET standard by failing to respect its commitment to assume ASTRA’s obligations under
the purchase orders placed with Airbus. Claimants say that Respondent reneged on its promise to
purchase 35 aircraft purchased by ASTRA (as part of its purchase of 73 aircraft from Airbus
between December 2006 and October 2007).!° At the heart of this claim is Claimants’ allegation
that Respondent initialled the Draft Agreement (the draft “Agreement for the Implementation of
Law 26,466”) which they say Respondent agreed to for the purpose of subrogating into ASTRA’s
aircraft purchase orders with Airbus and compensating them for the expropriation of the

Airlines. !°°!

859. The complex and extensive details of the various negotiations and draft agreements are
summarized above at paragraphs 456 through 464. Claimants say that the Draft Agreement would
have entailed the following benefits:
. Claimants would recover US$ 116,691,789 from Airbus in respect of pre-delivery payments
(“PDPs”) and buyer-furnished equipment payments (“BFEs”) made by Astra to Airbus for
aircraft allocated to ARSA and AUSA.

. Claimants would not be forced to pay the penalties associated with the cancellation of Astra’s
order for ARSA and AUSA.

* Claimants would receive US$150 million from Argentina in respect of the compensation for
the expropriation of the Argentine Airlines.

. Claimants would be able to maintain the Airbus contract and resell the remaining 38 Airbus

“slots” for a profit, 1°

860. Claimants say that due to Respondent’s failure to honor its commitments, ASTRA was
forced to cancel the Airbus purchase agreements and, as a result, the benefits set out above were
lost. Claimants say that coupled with the expropriation of the Airlines, the failure of the Draft
Agreement precipitated the collapse of the entirety of the Marsans Group. Claimants say that

of the Airbus purchase orders constitutes a violation of the FET standard and the obligations

relating to expropriation under Article V of the Treaty.!°%

861. Respondent denies that there was any agreement giving rise to any commitment relating to
the Airbus purchase orders. It says that it neither executed any agreement with ASTRA or Airbus,
nor undertook any commitments to them. It says that the negotiations with Interinvest were not
successful and did not give rise to any commitments regarding the settlement of the dispute

between the Parties.!0™

862. The Tribunal has reviewed the extensive evidence relating to Claimants’ allegation
regarding the assumption of the obligations under the Airbus purchase orders and concluded that
Respondent did not enter into any binding obligation in that regard. There was evidence of
negotiations between Interinvest and Respondent regarding the taking over of 35 of the purchase
orders from Airbus and that Respondent had some interest in doing so in order to acquire the
aircraft for the Airlines. There was also evidence of the dealings between Interinvest and ASTRA
and Airbus as well as between Respondent and Airbus regarding the assumption of the purchase
orders by Respondent. However, none of the relevant agreements under discussion were

concluded.

863. As discussed above, the proposed Draft Agreement is at the heart of Claimants’ claim.
However, this agreement was never executed and the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent
committed to signing and concluding that agreement. While Mr. Mujfioz Pérez testified that
Interinvest and Respondent had each initialed a copy of the Draft Agreement and provided it to
the other, Mr. Llorens denied that he had initialed or signed the Draft Agreement.!°° While there

was some evidence that the initial on Interinvest’s copy of the Draft Agreement was that of

Mr. Manuel Vazquez, '””° this was not clear. In any event, the Draft Agreement was never signed

on behalf of Respondent. !°°7

864. In contrast with the signature of the July 2008 Agreement, it does not appear that the
Parties’ negotiations led to any final agreement between them. The Tribunal accepts that there
were serious negotiations between the Parties to arrange for Respondent to take over ASTRA’s
purchase orders from Airbus for aircraft intended for the Airlines and to settle the disputes between
them. The Tribunal also accepts that such an agreement would have represented significant value
for both Respondent and Interinvest and Claimants. The Parties’ negotiations and the Draft
Agreement also confirm that ASTRA had identified a number of the aircraft it had ordered from
Airbus for use by the Airlines. However, the Tribunal is not persuaded that a final agreement was
ever reached. In these circumstances Claimants have not demonstrated that Respondent’s conduct
was in breach of a commitment or legitimate expectation such as to give rise to a breach of the

FET standard.

E. Conclusion on the alleged breaches of the FET standard

865. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that Respondent breached the obligation
of fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty in respect of its conduct relating to the July 2008
Agreement, described above at paragraphs 777 through 857. The Tribunal also finds that
Claimants have failed to prove a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in respect of

the other claims addressed in this section. Accordingly, the latter must be denied.

that the Parties were unable to reach agreement in respect of the Draft Agreement since agreement on behalf of
Respondent was dependent upon acceptance by Interinvest of a release or waiver of all judicial proceedings against

full protection and security and failed to observe obligations in regard of their investments.
Claimants also claim that Respondent failed to afford their investments protection pursuant to

Article III(1) of the Treaty.

867. Respondent disputes that Article IV(2) of the Treaty permits invoking the provisions of the
US-Argentina BIT that Claimants seek to apply. Respondent also disputes the merits of Claimants’
claims in respect of both full protection and security and breach of the umbrella clause contained

in the US-Argentina BIT.

868. Article IV of the Treaty reads in relevant part as follows:

TREATMENT

1. Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments
made by investors of the other Party.

2. In all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be no less favourable

than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory by investors of a third
country.

869. The relevant provisions of the US-Argentina BIT which Claimants seek to invoke provide

as follows:

ARTICLE IL

2. a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection
and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.

c) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments. °°
870. Claimants submit that the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty is very

broad and has been invoked and applied by previous tribunals to incorporate more favorable

provisions in other BITs concluded by Argentina or Spain. Further, they submit that many

tribunals have imported through MEN clauses more favorable substantive standards of treatment

accorded to investors of third countries.

871. Claimants say that the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT is a standard of treatment
granted to investors and, therefore, “a matter governed by” the (Spain-Argentina) Treaty.
According to them, by definition, the MFN Clause imports provisions that are absent from the base
treaty (in this case, the Treaty). According to Claimants, the most favored nation treatment
obligation applies as long as the third-party treaty provision containing the more favorable
treatment is of the same type, in this case, the same “matter regulated by” the base treaty. In other
words, as long as the third-party treaty addresses the protection of foreign investors, it applies. In
this regard, Claimants point to the award in MTD v. Chile where the tribunal incorporated an
umbrella clause taken from the Denmark-Chile BIT by means of an MEN clause in the Malaysia-

Chile BIT.!°”°

872. Claimants say that the fact that the Treaty is broad and covers the umbrella clause in the
US-Argentina BIT is supported by the fact that paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article IV of the Treaty
exclude a number of matters such as those granted by way of regional cooperation agreements
(Article [V(3)); tax treatment (Article IV(4)) and concessional funding (paragraph 1| of the Protocol
to the Treaty). They say that these matters are much further removed from the provisions in the
Treaty than the umbrella clause but that, because of the general nature of the MFN Clause, the
contracting parties to the Treaty nonetheless considered it prudent to exclude them. Claimants say
that other matters which are more directly related to the protection of foreign investments, such as
the umbrella clause, must be covered by the MEN provision. They also note that after the
conclusion of the Treaty in this case, Argentina has concluded numerous BITs which contain
umbrella clauses. This, they say, demonstrates that there is no public policy reason not to give

effect to the MFN Clause in the Treaty with respect to umbrella clauses contained in other BITs.!°7!

873. In response to Respondent’s arguments, Claimants say that the MFN Clause contained in
Article IV(2) of the Treaty does not apply only to matters that relate to fair and equitable treatment.
They say that Article IV(2) explicitly refers to “all matters” governed by the Treaty. They say that
the obligation to observe commitments undertaken towards claimants and their investments is a
“matter” that concerns the substantive treatment of investment protection promised by Respondent

in the Treaty. !°"

874. Claimants also reject Respondent’s argument that the MFN Clause does not apply to the
umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT because the Treaty in this case does not provide for an
umbrella clause itself. Claimants say that Respondent’s reasoning is circular and would negate
the meaning and basic purpose of MFN clauses. They say that if the Treaty contained an umbrella

clause, there would be no reason for Claimants to invoke the MEN Clause in the first place. 1073

875. Claimants go on to refer to a series of legal and contractual obligations which they say
were made with regard to Claimants’ investments. These include the commitment to allow the
Airlines to charge economically reasonable airfares (pursuant to the Air Business Law, Decree
No.6875/171 and the General Transfer Contract); the commitment to review airfares and to do so
according to specific and detailed mechanisms; the commitment to compensate airlines forced to
operate unprofitable routes; the obligation to allow airline companies to set airfares freely within
an air band; the obligation to exempt from VAT the purchase of fuel; and the obligation to exempt
from taxes the VAT for aircraft purchased or leased within a purchase option.'°’* With regard to
contractual obligations, Claimants say that Respondent undertook obligations in the May 2008
Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement. They say that under the May 2008 Agreement,
Respondent made a number of commitments relating primarily to the commitment to relieve

ARSA’s debt. In the July 2008 Agreement, Claimants say that Respondent committed to

Interinvest to co-manage the Airlines during the transition period.'°”>

876. Claimants say that the fact that the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement
were concluded between Respondent and Interinvest, and not directly between Respondent and
Claimants themselves, does not affect the claims based on these agreements. They say that the
umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT refers to obligations entered into “with regard to
investments”. At the time of the conclusion of these two agreements, Claimants held 99% of
Interinvest’s shares, which in turn held 94.41% of ARSA’s shares and 98.12% of AUSA’s shares.
According to Claimants, their interests in Interinvest (and thus, the Airlines) constitute
“investments” of Claimants. Claimants point to a number of awards in which tribunals have found
a breach of an umbrella clause as a result of breaches of agreements to which the claimants were
not direct parties.'°’ Claimants also say that Respondent failed to observe the obligations it
entered into with regard to Claimants’ investments pursuant to the various decrees and laws
previously described. They say that these instruments relate to Claimants’ investments and were
not in any way limited to Interinvest. Claimants say that they relied directly on these various
commitments when making, maintaining and, over the years, increasing their investment in the

Airlines.!0””

877. Respondent submitted that the scope of the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the
Treaty is restricted to fair and equitable treatment since it follows Article IV(1) which provides for
fair and equitable treatment of investments. Article IV(2) of the Treaty then refers to “such
treatment”. Respondent says that if the Parties to the Treaty had intended to grant the MFN Clause

a scope including “all treatments” instead of “such treatment”, they would have expressly stated

878. Respondent also says that neither the Umbrella Clause nor the full protection and security
provisions in the US-Argentina BIT fall within the scope of the MFN Clause since these are not
standards of treatment governed by the Treaty. Therefore, they cannot be considered as matters
governed by the Treaty and any attempt to expand the scope of the MFN Clause would be contrary
to the express intention of the Parties to the Treaty. It says that the States party to the Treaty were
fully aware of the existence of the umbrella clauses and full protection and security standards and

yet did not include them in the text of the Treaty. !°”

879. With respect to the question of full protection and security, Respondent acknowledges that
Article III(1) of the Treaty refers to the obligation of each party to “protect within its territory
investments made, in accordance with its legislation, or the investors of the [p]arty...”. However,
it maintains that in their Memorial Claimants did not raise this provision in support of their claim
that the full protection and security provision in the US-Argentina BIT should apply by virtue of
the MEN Clause. Therefore, according to Respondent, this argument was raised late and Claimants
should not be permitted to rely upon it. It says that Claimants attempted to import “full protection
and security” under Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT as a new guarantee or protection,

different from the one contained in Article III(1) of the Treaty. !°°°

880. The Tribunal commences with Respondent’s argument that the MFN Clause contained in
Article IV(2) of the Treaty applies only to fair and equitable treatment since the use of the language
“such treatment” can only refer to fair and equitable treatment which is provided for in the
preceding Article IV(1). The Tribunal is unable to accept this argument. Article IV(2) of the
Treaty expressly refers to “all matters governed by this Agreement”, which the Tribunal has found
to be unambiguously inclusive.'°*! This broad language is inconsistent with the notion that only
fair and equitable treatment was intended to be the subject of the most favorable nation treatment.
If such were the case, then the MFN Clause would apply only to more favorable FET provisions
contained in other BITs. In the Tribunal’s view, the plain or ordinary meaning of the language

does not sustain this interpretation. Rather, reading Articles IV(1) and (2) together, a more

harmonious and logical interpretation is that the parties to the Treaty are required to accord fair
and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of a Party and that in all matters
governed by the Treaty, the treatment accorded to investments (which must be fair and equitable
treatment pursuant Article TV(1)) shall be no less favorable than the treatment accorded to

investments made by investors of a third country.

881. Inthe Tribunal’s view, this interpretation reflects the ordinary meaning of the language of
Article IV of the Treaty. The Tribunal notes that this interpretation is consistent with previous
interpretations of Article IV(2) of the Treaty in the decisions in Maffezini, Gas Natural and Suez
cases.!°8? Further, in the Decision on Jurisdiction in this case, the Tribunal determined that the
MEN Clause contained in Article 1V(2) of the Treaty extends to matters other than fair and
equitable treatment when it applied it to the dispute resolution provisions contained in the
Australia-Argentina BIT.'°*° Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the MFN Clause contained in
Article IV(2) of the Treaty is not restricted to fair and equitable treatment provisions and can be
used in respect of all matters governed by the Treaty to incorporate more favorable provisions

from other BITs concluded by Argentina.

882. The Tribunal now turns to Respondent’s arguments that the MFN Clause does not apply to
permit Claimants to invoke the application of the umbrella clause or the full protection and security
provisions in the US-Argentina BIT because the Treaty in this case does not provide for an
umbrella clause or full protection and security. In this regard, Claimants argued that the MFN
Clause permits importing provisions that are absent from the base treaty and that if this were not
so, the MEN Clause would have no effect. Claimants say that pursuant to the ejusdem generis
principle, MFN treatment applies as long as the third-party treaty provision containing the more
favorable treatment is of the same type as in the base treaty. In this case, Claimants argue that the
Spain-Argentina BIT and the US-Argentina BIT are of the same type, or address the same “matter

regulated by the base treaty: the protection of foreign investors.” In this regard, as noted above at

paragraph 870, Claimants rely on the Award in MTD v. Chile which they say incorporated an
umbrella clause taken from the Denmark-Chile BIT by means of an MEN clause in the Malaysia-
Chile BIT. In respect of the question of having recourse to the provisions of the US-Argentina
BIT in respect of full protection and security, Claimants note that, in any event, the Treaty does
provide for protection of investments and, therefore, is specifically included as a matter governed

by the Treaty.

883. Respondent submits that the MFN Clause in Article IV(2) of the Treaty cannot be used to
introduce an entire umbrella clause or a full protection and security provision not contained in the
Treaty. Further, it seeks to distinguish the various decisions relied by Claimants (notably,
Maffezini, Gas Natural and Suez on the basis that they are irrelevant since they concerned the
incorporation of dispute settlement provisions rather than substantive provisions. Respondent also

distinguished the MTD and Bayindir cases on other grounds. !°%*

884. In the Tribunal’s view, in interpreting the scope of the MFN Clause contained in
Article IV(2) of the Treaty, meaning must be given to the critical words “[iJn all matters governed
by this Agreement”. According to Claimants, this language should be interpreted as referring
generally to the protection of foreign investors. This interpretation is too broad and disregards the
reference to all “matters” governed by the Treaty. In the Tribunal’s view, the plain and ordinary
meaning of this language is to refer to the various rights or forms of protection contained in the
individual provisions of the Treaty. The Tribunal accepts that the parties to the Treaty were in all
likelihood aware of the existence of umbrella clauses and if they had intended to include such a
clause in the Treaty, they would have done so.'°*> According to Respondent, use of the MFN
Clause to incorporate an umbrella clause into the Treaty would result in the incorporation of a new
right or standard of treatment not provided for the Treaty. On the basis of the specific language

used by the Parties in the Treaty, the Tribunal finds this argument persuasive.

885. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has considered Claimants’ argument that limiting
the application of the MFN Clause to the provisions or treatment that is already present in the base
treaty would deprive the clause of any effect. However, this does not appear to be correct since
the MEN Clause could clearly “improve” the standards of protection contained in the Treaty by
incorporating more favorable standards from another treaty. In this regard, the MFN Clause could
lead to the incorporation of more favorable standards in relation to, for example, discriminatory or
unjustified measures, fair and equitable treatment, expropriation and transfers of income or
earnings.'°*° As a result, the MFN Clause would not be deprived of any meaning or effect were

its scope to be limited to rights or standards contained in the Treaty.

886. The Tribunal has also considered the various authorities relied upon by Claimants in
support of their position that the MFN Clause can be applied to invoke the application of rights or
standards not contained in the Treaty. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that in the various cases
cited by Claimants, the relevant base treaties appear to have provided rights or protection which
the claimants sought to improve upon by having recourse to more favorable provisions in other
treaties. For example, in the cases dealing with more favorable dispute resolution provisions, the

base treaties already contained similar, albeit less favorable, dispute resolution provisions.

887. The cases of MTD v. Chile and Bayindir v. Pakistan are somewhat different. Nevertheless,
they are also distinguishable. In the case of MTD v. Chile, the question that the tribunal considered
relevant was whether the provision that the claimants sought to invoke from other treaties (which
dealt with the obligation to award permits subsequent to approval of an investment and to
fulfillment of contractual obligations) could be considered as part of fair and equitable treatment

(which was provided for the in the base treaty).!°°7 The MEN clause at issue provided as follows:

Investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting
Party shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable, and not less favourable than that accorded
to investments made by investors of any third State. !°**

1086 See Resp. Rej. | 767 where Respondent accepts that the MFN Clause covers any substantive issue governed by

the Treaty and provides these examples contained in Articles IV, V and VI of the Treaty.

all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment...”: as quoted in MTD v. Chile J 107.

In addressing that question, the tribunal held as follows:

104. The Tribunal considers the meaning of fair and equitable treatment below and refers to that
discussion. The Tribunal has concluded that, under the BIT, the fair and equitable standard
of treatment has to be interpreted in the manner most conducive to fulfill the objective of the
BIT to protect investments and create conditions favourable to investments. The Tribunal
considers that to include as part of the protections of the BIT those included in Article III(1)
of the Denmark BIT and Article III(3) and (4) of the Croatia BIT is in consonance with this
purpose. !°8?

In the Tribunal’s view, this distinguishes the MTD v. Chile case since the tribunal in that case
appears to have based its decision to permit the invocation of the clauses invoked from the Croatia-
Chile BIT and Denmark-Chile BIT on its interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard
in the base treaty between Malaysia and Chile.'° In addition, the language of the relevant MFN
clause in the MTD v. Chile case is different from that of Article [V(2) of the Treaty in this case in

that it does not contain the language “in all matters governed by this Agreement”.

888. In the Bayindir v. Pakistan case, the respondent does not appear to have raised the same
objection under consideration here. Rather, it argued the importation of a FET clause from another
BIT is only possible if it is not excluded by the intention of the Contracting Parties. '°°! The
relevant MFN clause in the Turkey-Pakistan BIT provided as follows:

Each Party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no less favourable than

that accorded in similar situations to investments of its investors or to investments of investors of
any third country, whichever is the most favourable.

The preamble to that treaty also contained the following language:

Agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable
framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources.

889. The tribunal of the Bayindir v. Pakistan case found that while this language of the BIT

offered little assistance since the preamble does not establish any operative obligation, it was

 

1089 MTD v. Chile J 104. It is worth noting that, as pointed out by Respondent, the respondent in the MTD v. Chile
case did not argue against the application of the provisions sought to be incorporated by use of the MEN clause.
Nevertheless, the tribunal considered it appropriate to examine the MFN clause in the base treaty and satisfy itself that
its terms permitted the use of the provisions from the other treaties.

109 Tn its final decision, the tribunal found that certain of the respondent’s conduct had breached the obligations under
Article III(1) of the Malaysia-Chile BIT, quoted above.

relevant for the interpretation of the MFN clause in its context and in light of the treaty’s object
and purpose. It was of the view that the reference to FET in the preamble, together with the absence
of an FET clause in the treaty, did not rule out the possibility of importing an FET obligation
through the MFN clause contained in the treaty. Rather, it stated that “[t]he fact that the States
parties to the Treaty clearly contemplated the importance of the FET rather suggests the contrary.
Indeed, even though it does not establish an operative obligation, the preamble is relevant for the

interpretation of the MFN clause...”.!°°

890. The Tribunal also notes that the language of the MFN clause at issue in the Bayindir v.
Pakistan case is different from the language of the Treaty. Again, there is no reference to the
relevant language relating to the scope of Article IV(2) of the Treaty: “in all matters governed by
this Agreement”. In the Tribunal’s view, the MTD and Bayindir decisions are distinguishable from
this case. The language of the relevant MEN clauses is different and the context and the provisions
sought to be included from third-party treaties are also different. In the MTD and Bayindir cases,
the MEN clause was used to invoke FET provisions in circumstances where there was reference
to fair and equitable treatment in the base treaties. In this case, Claimants seek to invoke the MFN
Clause to incorporate an umbrella clause in circumstances where there is no umbrella clause in the

Treaty, nor any reference to or mention of such a clause.

891. Asaresult, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the decisions in the MTD and Bayindir cases

support Claimants’ claim to invoke the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT in this case.

892. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Article IV(2) of the Treaty does not apply
to permit Claimants to invoke the umbrella clause from the US-Argentina BIT. Accordingly,

Claimants’ claim based on this clause must fail.

893. Claimants’ arguments with respect to invoking the full protection and security provisions
from the US-Argentina BIT are somewhat different. Claimants advanced a claim on the basis of

Article III(1) of the Treaty which provides that “each Party shall protect within its territory

10% Bayindir v. Pakistan | 155. The tribunal went on to refer to the MTD v. Chile decision and concluded that on the
basis of the MFN provision in the Turkey-Pakistan BIT, the claimant could invoke the application of the FET standard
in the Switzerland-Pakistan BIT. See Bayindir v. Pakistan ff 158-159 and 167.

investments made, in accordance with its legislation, or the investors of the other Party...”. In
addition, Claimants invoked Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT which requires “full
protection and security” to the extent that treatment was more favorable than the treatment
accorded under Article III of the Treaty. In its Reply, Claimants responded to Respondent’s
argument that since the Treaty did not contain any provision relating to “full protection and
security” (or an umbrella clause), the full protection and security standard did not constitute a
matter governed by the Treaty and therefore exceeded the scope of the application of the MFN
Clause. Claimants argued that it was not necessary for them to resort to the MFN Clause in order
to apply a “full” protection and security standard on the basis that there was no significant
difference between “protection” and “full protection and security”. In any event, Claimants
submitted that should the Tribunal find that Article II(1) of the Treaty does not in and of itself
require “full” protection and security, it invoked the MFN Clause to apply the full protection and
security standard contained in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT. In that regard, Claimants
argued that the Treaty does contain a protection clause and, therefore, they did not seek to import

an entirely new, substantive standard but, rather, sought to improve an existing one.'?

894. For its part, Respondent argued that this was a new claim or argument that should have
been presented in Claimants’ Memorial. Further, Respondent argued that the Tribunal should not
accept Claimants’ argument that they had implicitly raised this argument in their Memorial when
they argued that it was not necessary to resort to the MFN Clause to apply a “full” protection and
security standard since the Treaty already contained a provision on protection. Respondent argued

that Claimants should not be permitted to introduce a new argument at the reply stage. !°*

895. In the Tribunal’s view, in their Memorial, Claimants based their claim for a breach of the
standard of protection on both Article III(1) of the Treaty and, through the MFN Clause,
Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT. They argued that there was no significant difference
between the two standards but that in the event the Tribunal disagreed, they sought to invoke the

more favorable provision of the US-Argentina BIT. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that

Claimants did implicitly raise the argument that it was not necessary to resort to the MFN Clause
in order to apply a “full” protection and security standard in this case. In any event, the Tribunal
finds that when it raised in its Reply the argument that the Treaty contained a protection clause
and that it simply sought to improve the treatment accorded by that clause by having recourse to
the US-Argentina BIT, Respondent had ample opportunity to respond and has not demonstrated
any prejudice flowing from what it says are new arguments. Accordingly, Respondent’s objection

as to the timing of Claimants’ argument is dismissed.

896. Article III(1) of the Treaty contains an obligation that each Party shall protect within its
territory investments made by investors of the Party. As a result, protection of investments is a
matter governed by the Treaty and, for the reasons set out above, the MFN Clause contained in
Article IV(2) of the Treaty permits Claimants to invoke the full protection and security provision
contained in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT. The Tribunal now turns to whether there is
any significant difference between the standards in question and the merits of Claimants’ claim

that Respondent failed to protect their investments.

897. Having reviewed the authorities cited by Claimants, the Tribunal is of the view that there
is no significant difference between the duty to protect investments under Article III(1) of the
Treaty and the duty of full protection and security in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT for
present purposes.'”> In any event, to the extent the standard of “full protection and security” may
be more favorable, the Tribunal applies that standard as set out in Article II(2)(a) of the US-

Argentina BIT.
898. Claimants summarize the full protection standard as follows:

O — Generally, the standard imposes an obligation of “due diligence” and “vigilance” on the host
State with respect to the protection and security of investments (AAPL, AMT)

a More specifically, a host State is required to take all measures necessary to ensure the
protection and security of investments (AAPL, AMT)

a The standard is violated if a host State fails to comply with its own national laws or the
standard of protection required by international law (AMT)

a The standard is violated by a failure immediately to address and rectify acts that have harmed
an investment, such as a failure immediately to restore seized properties to an investor's
possession (Wena Hotels)

a A government will be charged with violating the standard if it could have directed others to
take such restorative acts but failed to do so (Wena Hotels)

O ‘The standard extends beyond “physical” security and requires a “secure investment
environment” (CME, Siemens, Azurix, Vivendi II, Frontier Petroleum, Biwater Gauff,
National Grid)

a The standard is violated if a government, through its laws or administrative applications,

withdraws approval of or devalues an investor’s investment (CME)!°°°

899. Claimants allege that Respondent breached this standard in the following ways. First,
Respondent failed to permit Claimants to charge economically reasonable airfares which had been
guaranteed in numerous Argentine laws, decrees and contractual commitments. Second,
Respondent failed to protect Claimants’ investments by appointing and maintaining in office, as
Undersecretary of Air Transportation, Mr. Cirielli. Third, Claimants say that Respondent breached
the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement and then unlawfully expropriated the

Airlines.

900. In response to Respondent’s arguments, Claimants submit that the weight of relevant
jurisprudence indicates that full protection and security clauses are not limited to physical harm
and cover the protection and security of intangible assets. Further, Claimants say that they do not
claim that the full protection and security standard amounts to “an obligation to assume full
responsibility”. However, the standard compels the host State to act with due diligence, requiring
the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected
to exercise in the circumstances. They note that the threshold for finding a violation of this

standard is low, since a mere lack of diligence will suffice and there is no need to establish malice

or negligence. Finally, Claimants note the close relationship between the full protection and

security standard and the fair and equitable treatment standard. !°°”

901. Respondent says that the full protection and security standard covers the obligation to
afford physical protection only. In any event, Respondent says that the standard could never
amount to an obligation to assume full responsibility on the basis of a strict or absolute obligation
upon the host State since it cannot be required to avoid any kind of act that may be detrimental to
a foreign investor. According to Respondent, the obligation entails the adoption of reasonable
measures, under the circumstances of the case, aimed at preventing hostile acts by the State itself
or a third party towards a foreign investor. Finally, Respondent says that the obligation to provide
full protection and security does not require a host State to refrain from altering its law, nor does
it extend to encompass the maintenance of a stable legal and commercial environment.!°°8 With
respect to the alleged similarity between the full protection and security standard and the FET
standard, Respondent says that since the Treaty provides for fair and equitable treatment and
protection and security in two distinct clauses, the Parties must have intended them to mean two
different things, and so in interpreting these two standards the Tribunal give effect to that intention

by giving the two concepts distinct meanings and fields of application. !°?

902. In respect of the specific merits of Claimants’ allegations, Respondent responded as

follows:

. The regulatory framework governing airfares applied to all airlines and was in place well
before the Marsans Group became involved in the Airlines. While the Airlines were under
the management of the Marsans Group, there were four airfare increases which were
sufficient to cover the costs of the Airlines during the relevant period. Further, the relevant

context was that of acute widespread crisis in Argentina.

. In respect of the conduct of Mr. Cirielli, he took a leave of absence from his position as

Secretary General of APTA when he was appointed as Undersecretary of Commercial Air

Transport. Therefore, he did not perform in both capacities at the same time. Further, there
is no evidence to support the allegation that Mr. Cirielli encouraged the strike in November
2005, referred to by Claimants. Finally, Respondent notes that it was through State
mechanisms that measures were implemented in order to prevent Mr. Cirielli from acting

in cases where there could be a conflict of interest with the Airlines.

. In respect of the May 2008 Agreement and July 2008 Agreement, Respondent says that
they did not fail due to its conduct. Rather, the Agreements were breached by Interinvest
or Air Comet. Respondent also says that the Agreements became meaningless due to the
reality of the Airlines’ condition which, when Respondent became aware of it, made it

impossible to maintain a purchase option in relation to the Airlines.

. In respect of the expropriation of the shares in the Airlines, Respondent says that it acted

in accordance with the applicable substantive and procedural laws.!!°°

903. Having considered the Parties’ arguments regarding the nature of the obligation to protect
investments and to provide them full protection and security, there is no significant difference for
the present purposes. As Claimants have invoked the application of the full protection and security
standard contained in the US-Argentina BIT, which the Tribunal has found to be valid, the relevant
question is whether Respondent has breached the obligation of providing full protection and

security.

904. In respect of the relationship between the standard of full protection and security and that
of fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal finds the distinction drawn in the Suez Decision on

Jurisdiction, cited by Respondent, persuasive.!!°!

In the Treaty, the provisions regarding
protection of investments and fair and equitable treatment are contained in two distinct articles,

which leads to the conclusion that the Parties must have intended them to address different things.

As a result, the Tribunal believes that these two standards should be given distinct meanings and

fields of application. !!°

905. Nevertheless, the Tribunal accepts there is considerable overlap between the concepts of
fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, as submitted by Claimants. In the
Tribunal’s view, the fair and equitable standard is broader than that of full protection and security.
As a result, while a breach of the full protection and security clause would likely constitute a
violation of fair and equitable treatment, the converse is not necessarily the case. Not all violations
of the fair and equitable treatment standard automatically constitute violations of the full protection
and security standard. Finally, having reviewed the various awards and authorities cited by the
Parties, the Tribunal is of the view while the traditional notion of full protection and security
addresses the protection of property from physical threats and injury, it can, in appropriate
circumstances, include the protection of intangible assets which fall within the scope of the

definition of an investment in the relevant treaty.

906. On the basis of the findings it has made in respect of the application of the FET standard,
set out above, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants have not demonstrated a breach of the full
protection and security standard in respect of their allegations relating to the regulatory framework
governing airfares and the appointment and maintenance of Mr. Cirielli as the Undersecretary of
Air Transportation. With respect to Claimants’ allegations relating to the May 2008 Agreement
and July 2008 Agreement and the expropriation of the Airlines, the Tribunal is of the view that
these relate more closely to the standard of fair and equitable treatment and the standard for
expropriation and are more appropriately considered as part of Claimants’ claims under those

standards.

907. In respect of Claimants’ claim relating to the regulatory framework and the Airlines
inability to charge economically reasonable airfares, the Tribunal has found that the conduct of

Respondent of which Claimants complain does not amount to a breach of the fair and equitable

1102 The Tribunal reaches this conclusion despite the fact that the full protection and security provision contained in
Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT refers to both fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in
the same article.

treatment standard. In that regard, the Tribunal found that although the airfares provided under
the regulatory framework were not sufficient to cover the Airlines’ costs, for various reasons this
did not amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. As a result, the Tribunal
is not persuaded that Respondent’s conduct in relation to the airfares amounts to a breach of the

full protection and security standard.

908. The Tribunal reaches the same conclusion with respect to Claimants’ allegations relating
to the appointment and maintenance in office of Mr. Cirielli. For the reasons stated above at
paragraphs 693 through 711, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent’s conduct does not amount
to a breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment. As a result, the Tribunal is not
persuaded that Respondent’s conduct in relation to the appointment and maintenance in office of

Mr. Cirielli amounts to a breach of the full protection and security standard.

909. As indicated above, Claimants’ allegations with respect to the May 2008 Agreement and
July 2008 Agreement and the expropriation of the Airlines are more closely linked to and
appropriately addressed under Claimants’ claims for breaches of the fair and equitable treatment
standard and the breach of Article V of the Treaty in respect of expropriation. As set out above at
paragraphs 777 through 857, the Tribunal has found that Respondent breached the obligation of
fair and equitable treatment in respect of the July 2008 Agreement.'!°? The Tribunal addresses

Claimants’ allegations with respect to expropriation below.

910. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have not demonstrated a breach of the full
protection and security standard in respect of its allegations relating to the regulatory framework,
the appointment and maintenance of Mr. Cirielli as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation and
the May 2008 Agreement. Further, the Tribunal finds that the claims relating to the July 2008
Agreement and the expropriation of the Airlines are more appropriately considered as part of

Claimants’ claims of a breach of the FET standard and of unlawful expropriation.

FET standard in respect of the May 2008 Agreement.

X. UNJUSTIFIED AND DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES

911. Claimants also allege that Respondent breached Article III(1) of the Treaty. That provision

reads as follows:

PROTECTION

1. Each Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its
legislation by investors of the other Party and shall not obstruct, by unjustified or discriminatory
measures, the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, where appropriate,
liquidation of such investments. !!+

912. Claimants say that the phrase “unjustified or discriminatory measures” uses the disjunctive
“or” and therefore either “unjustified” or “discriminatory measures” will violate Article III(1) of
the Treaty. !!°5

913. According to Claimants, the ordinary meaning of “unjustified” is “unreasonable” or
“arbitrary”. They say there is no relevant distinction between these terms in the context of
impairment clauses in BITs. In response to Respondent’s arguments on the meaning of arbitrary,
Claimants summarized that arbitrary treatment encompasses actions that: (i) bear no rational
relation to their stated purposes; (ii) were coercive, retaliatory or in bad faith; and (iii) were taken
in willful disregard of legal standards, due process and proper procedure. !!°°

914. Claimants say that the following measures adopted by Respondent were all unjustified,

unreasonable or arbitrary:

* The maintenance of Ricardo Cirielli as the public official responsible for the air transportation
sector, despite findings by a federal appellate court and the Argentine Anticorruption Office,
that he had a conflict of interest with respect to the Argentine Airlines;

* The GOA’s rejection of the Argentine Airlines’ requests for airfare increases and failure to
respect the legal framework in place at the time of and throughout the Claimants’ investment;

1105 The Spanish text of Article III(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:
PROTECCION
1.- Cada Parte protegera en su territorio las inversiones efectuadas, conforme a su legislacién,
0 inversores de la otra Parte y no obstaculizard, mediante medidas injustificadas 0 discriminatorias,

* The GOA’s judicial challenge of ARSA’s financial statements;
. The GOA’s breach of the May 2008 Agreement; and

. The GOA’s breach of the July 2008 Agreement and expropriation of the Argentine
Airlines. "7

915. Claimants also say that Respondent adopted discriminatory measures against their
investments. In this regard, they say that discrimination entails two elements: the measures
directed against a particular party must be for reasons unrelated to the substance of the matter; and,

discrimination entails like persons being treated in an equivalent manner. !!°

916. Claimants say that Respondent and its officials treated their investments discriminatorily
due to the fact that they were Spanish, and not Argentine. In this regard, Claimants point to the
following examples: Mr. Cirielli’s antagonism against Air Comet’s purchase of a controlling share
in the Airlines; favoring other Argentine airlines, including SOL, over the Airlines by, inter alia,
subsidizing fuel costs for certain flights; targeting the Airlines by refusing to sufficiently raise
airfares until it took control of them; expropriating the Airlines, at least in part, because Air Comet
and Claimants were Spanish (noting that none of the other airlines in Argentina were

expropriated). !!°

917. Respondent disputed Claimants’ interpretation of both “unjustified” and “discriminatory
measures”. It also denied that any of the conduct identified by Claimants constituted either

unjustified or discriminatory conduct.!!!°

918. With respect to unjustified measures, Respondent submitted that “unjustified” measures
are very similar to the notion of arbitrariness. It relies on the definition of arbitrariness set out in
the ELSI Decision of the International Court of Justice to the effect that arbitrariness is something

opposed to the rule of law and is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or

at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.!!!!

Respondent also relies upon the decision in
Noble Ventures v. Romania for the proposition that in examining the existence of arbitrariness,
account should be taken of whether the measures adopted by the State were a short-term solution
to avoid collapse and whether they were reasonable and well founded. Accordingly, it says that it

is important to consider the circumstances in which the measures were taken.!!!?

919. On the merits of Claimants’ claim of unjustified measures, Respondent contested each of

the allegations on the following basis:

. The Federal Court of Appeals and the Argentine Anti-Corruption Office addressed
the potential conflict of interest of Mr. Cirielli and did not request his removal.
Further, Mr. Cirielli took a leave of absence from his union duties upon
appointment as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Finally, Respondent submits

that Claimants have not provided reliable evidence of any discriminatory conduct.

. Respondent complied with the regulatory framework at the time the initial
investment was made and throughout its course. The rejection of any request for
airfare increases was justified on technical grounds and, even if these grounds were
incorrect (which is not admitted), this would not convert well justified measures

into unjustified measures. Further, the airfare increases granted were adequate.

. The challenge of ARSA’s financial statements before the courts was appropriate.

. Even assuming that there was any breach of the May 2008 Agreement and the July
2008 Agreement (which is denied), that would be, at best, contrary to a contractual
provision and would not amount to a breach of the standard of arbitrariness

articulated in the ELSI case.

apply only to investments made in accordance with the law. In addition, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should
also bear in mind that the investments invoked by Claimants caused serious economic losses to both Argentina and
Spain.

. The expropriation of the shares in the Airlines was conducted in accordance with
Argentine law and Article V of the Treaty, both of which were in place long before

Claimants’ investment was made.!!!3

920. In respect of the alleged discriminatory measures, Respondent submits that a breach of
Article III(1) of the Treaty requires treatment: (a) that is different for a foreign investor by reason
of its nationality; (b) that is less favorable than that accorded to other investors in like
circumstances; (c) that is intended to harm the foreign investor; (d) that causes actual harm to the
foreign investor; and (e) that is not justified by sufficient reasons. According to Respondent, these
elements are cumulative and must all be present in order for a measure to be deemed

discriminatory.!!!4

921. Inrespect of the substance of Claimants’ allegation of discriminatory conduct, Respondent

made the following points:

. Claimants did not provide proof that either Mr. Cirielli or the Government denied
airfare increases or expropriate the shares of the Airlines because they were owned

by Spanish entities.

. Claimants did not demonstrate how the other airlines alleged to have been favored

over the Airlines were in a similar situation.

. There was no evidence of a campaign to “re-Argentinize” the Airlines. If, in the
end, the Airlines had to be expropriated, this was due to the condition of the Airlines

which, in order to maintain public air transport service, left no other choice. !!!5

determine the claims relating to unjustified and discriminatory measures expeditiously. The

Tribunal’s conclusions set out below refer to and rely upon its earlier findings.

923. Commencing with the claims relating to unjustified measures under Article III(1) of the
Treaty, it appears to be common ground between the Parties that unjustified measures are
equivalent to arbitrary measures. This is consistent with the Tribunal’s view that the ordinary or
plain meaning of unjustified and arbitrary is very similar. With respect to the Parties’ difference
over the interpretation of “arbitrary” or “arbitrariness”, the Tribunal finds Claimants’ position
more persuasive. Since the ELS/ decision, several tribunals have gone beyond the limited notion
of arbitrariness set out in that case and, relying on the ordinary meaning of the term, have
articulated a broader notion of arbitrary treatment. In this regard, the Tribunal finds the definition
of “arbitrary”, in the decisions in Azurix, Siemens, LG&E and National Grid, reasonable and

persuasive. !!!¢

924. Turning to the measures that Claimants allege were unjustified or arbitrary, the Tribunal
finds that with the exception of the measures related to the July 2008 Agreement and the
expropriation of the shares of the Airlines, none of the impugned measures amount to unjustified
or arbitrary measures. These measures are reviewed above in the context of the allegations of

breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. 17 Th each case, the Tribunal found that the

1116 See Cl. Reply {519-525 and the sources cited there. Among these, Claimants refer to Prof. Christophe Schreuer,
who writes that various categories of measures can be described as arbitrary or unreasonable:
. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent or legitimate
purpose. The decisive criterion for the determination of the unreasonable or arbitrary nature
of a measure harming the investor would be whether it can be justified in terms of rational
reasons that are related to the facts. Arbitrariness would be absent if the measure is a
reasonable and proportionate reaction to objectively verifiable circumstances;

. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal
preference;
. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker.

This applies, in particular, where a public interest is put forward as a pretext to take measures
that are designed to harm the investor; and
*  ameasure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.

alleged conduct did not amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. For the
same reasons, the Tribunal finds that the measures in question were not unjustified or arbitrary in

breach of Article III(1) of the Treaty.

925. However, as set out above at paragraphs 823 through 857, the Tribunal has found that
Respondent’s conduct in respect of the July 2008 Agreement and its failure to observe its
commitment to purchase the shares of the Airlines in accordance with the third party valuation
mechanism contained in the agreement amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard. In reaching that conclusion, the Tribunal found that Respondent’s objections to the
Credit Suisse valuation submitted by Interinvest were artificial, that Respondent had sufficient
information to assess that valuation and, despite this, on the basis of these excuses failed to proceed
with the valuation procedure agreed with Interinvest. It then obtained an injunction to maintain
its appointee as the General Manager of the Airlines and proceeded to expropriate the shares of
the Airlines. The Tribunal has found that such conduct lacked transparency, was arbitrary and
amounted to a breach of the FET standard. For the same reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the

conduct in question also amounts to unjustified measures under Article III(1) of the Treaty.

926. In respect of Claimants’ allegations that Respondent hindered by discriminatory measures
Claimants’ investments in the Airlines, the Tribunal finds that these have not been proved. For
the reasons set out previously, Claimants have not demonstrated that the conduct of Mr. Cirielli or
Respondent was discriminatory. Further, the conduct Claimants complain of in regard to the
regulatory framework and the airfare increases applied to all airlines operating in Argentina and
did not single out the Airlines for special treatment. In addition, in respect of the alleged favoring
of rival airlines over ARSA and AUSA, Claimants have not sufficiently identified these incidents,
nor have they established that the other airlines and ARSA and AUSA were in similar or like
circumstances. Finally, with respect to the expropriation of the shares in the Airlines, Claimants
have not demonstrated that the expropriation was carried out because the shares were owned by
Spanish or foreign interests. Accordingly, Claimants’ claims in respect of discriminatory measures

have not been made out.

927. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has not breached the
obligation not to obstruct by discriminatory measures, but has breached the obligation not to hinder
by unjustified measures the management, maintenance, use, and sale of Claimants’ investment

pursuant to Article III(1) of the Treaty.

XI. ALLEGED BREACHES - CREEPING EXPROPRIATION

928. In addition to their central claim that the Airlines were illegally expropriated by
Respondent, Claimants maintain that there was also an indirect or creeping expropriation of their
investment. In this regard, Claimants point to a number of the measures already discussed above

in the context of their claim for a breach of the FET standard:

(a) The “airfare squeeze” !!!®

(b) The “serious conflict of interests” posed by Undersecretary Cirielli!!!°

(c) The acts taken by the “government-supported” air transportation unions!!2°

(d) Respondent’s acts with respect to the June 2006 Agreement, including
Respondent’s coercion of Claimants to obtain additional shares at no cost, its
unilateral modification of the text of the June 2006 Agreement, and its breach of
the June 2006 Agreement by failing to set TER-compliant airfares and contributing

to the promised 15% stock option of ARSA!!?!

representatives in early 2008!!22

(g) Respondent’s de facto confiscation in 2008!!74

929. In light of the overlap between the claims for breach of FET and creeping expropriation,
the Tribunal considers it most efficient to address the creeping expropriation claims at this stage

and before turning to the claims of direct expropriation.

A. Positions of the Parties on Indirect or Creeping Expropriation Claims

930. Claimants assert that the sum of Argentina’s measures, including the formal expropriation
of the Airlines and those measures constituting a breach of the FET obligation, also constitute
creeping expropriation under Article V of the Treaty.''?> Claimants assert that “[t]hrough its
conduct, the GOA gradually deflated the value of Claimants’ investment and deprived Claimants
of legal and contractual rights fundamental to their investment, as well as the use and enjoyment

of that investment.”!!¢

931. Respondent asserts that the acts cited by Claimants do not constitute creeping
expropriation. According to Respondent, they are merely regulatory and contractual claims that
fall outside the scope of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction and which, in any case, have not resulted in

B. Tribunal’s Analysis

932. The Tribunal will review the claims for unlawful expropriation in detail in the following
section. At this stage of the Award, the Tribunal will address only the claims that there was also
an indirect or creeping expropriation of Claimants’ investment. Claimants argue that the measures
noted at paragraph 928 above, in addition to amounting to unfair and inequitable treatment, also
resulted in a creeping expropriation of their investment that culminated in a formal taking at the

end of 2008. In this regard, Claimants rely on Article V of the Treaty and the decisions of other

124 C], PHB 181.

arbitral tribunals which have developed the test for finding an indirect or “creeping” expropriation

occurred. Article V of the Treaty provides:

Nationalization, expropriation or any other measure having similar characteristics or effects that
might be adopted by the authorities of one Party against investments made in its territory by
investors of the other Party shall be effected only in the public interest, in accordance with the law,
and shall in no case be discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay the investor or
his assignee appropriate compensation without undue delay and in freely convertible currency.

 

[Emphasis added]
933. Claimants note that Article V of the Treaty explicitly covers both direct and indirect
expropriation, as it refers not only to nationalization and expropriation but also “any other measure

having similar characteristics or effects”.'!8 The Tribunal agrees with this position. For an indirect

 

expropriation, the focus of the analysis is on measures other than nationalization or expropriation

 

that have “similar characteristics or effects” to those measures. Any measure with similar
characteristics or effects in order to be lawful under Article V of the Treaty must be affected only
in the public interest, in accordance with the law, without discrimination and must be accompanied
by appropriate compensation. Tribunals have considered the nature of nationalization or
expropriation in deciding whether certain measures had similar characteristics or effects so as to

engage the requirements for expropriation under treaties or customary international law.

934. In the decision in Santa Elena v. Costa Rica, the tribunal considered the nature of

expropriation in the following passage:

What has to be identified is the extent to which the measures taken have deprived the owner of the
normal control of his property...There is ample authority for the proposition that a property has
been expropriated when the effect of the measures taken by the state has been to deprive the owner
of title, possession or access to the benefit and economic use of his property...Stated differently,
international law does not lay down any precise or automatic criterion, such as the date of the transfer
of ownership [...] or judicial determination of the amount of compensation or by payment of
compensation. ...[what matters is] the date on which the governmental “interference” has deprived
the owner of his rights or has made those rights practically useless ... Although the expropriation
by the decree of 5 May 1978 was only the first step in a process of transferring the Property to the
Government, it cannot reasonably be maintained [...] that this Decree expressed no more than an
“intention” to expropriate or that, in 1978, the Government merely “sought to expropriate” ... As of
that date, the practical and economic use of the Property by the Claimant was irretrievably lost,

Award

notwithstanding that [the Claimant] remained in possession of the property. As of 5 May 1978,
Claimant’s ownership of Santa Elena was effectively blighted or sterilized...”!"°

935. Thus, in Santa Elena, it was recognized that the essence of expropriatory measures is “to
deprive the owner of the normal control of his property” and that this occurs when “governmental
‘interference’ has deprived the owner of his [ownership] rights or has made those rights practically

useless”.

936. Relying on Tippets, Abbett, McStratton v. TAMS-AFFA, Claimants argue that an
expropriation can occur even when legal title to the property has not been affected if “events
demonstrate that the owner was deprived of fundamental rights of ownership” and noted that the
appointment of a government manager has been found to be an act of expropriation, as it denied
the investor’s rights to manage and control their investment.''*° Claimants describe the 2008
formal expropriation as “the culmination of a long process of financial strangulation and gradual

expropriation of Claimants’ investment.”!!3!

937. The Tribunal considers that to the extent that Claimants argue that particular measures
deprived them of their rights of ownership, including legal title to their shares, the right to manage
the Airlines or actual control over them, it is clear that those measures would be expropriatory.
The essence of expropriation is a taking or deprivation of de facto or de jure rights of ownership.
There is no doubt that the formal taking of the Airlines through Law No. 26,466 on December 17,
2008 was expropriatory in that it authorized the expropriation of the investor’s indirectly held
shares of the Airlines and the exercise of the shares’ corporate rights by the Government. Law
26,412, which was enacted on September 18, 2008 and which approved Government of
Argentina’s “repossession” of the Airlines, was also expropriatory in nature as it contemplated the
taking of Claimants’ shares following valuation of compensation by the TTN. Whether the formal
taking of Claimants’ investment was lawful will be discussed in the next section of this award. At
this stage of the analysis, the Tribunal must consider whether any other acts in the series of

measures in this case - short of the formal taking of their ownership rights - were also

expropriatory.

938. Working back in time from these clearly expropriatory acts, the next measure that was
alleged to be expropriatory in nature was the transition in day-to-day management of the Airlines

from Claimants to Respondent through the appointment of a General Manager, Mr. Alak.

939. As has been discussed in detail in the section on FET, through the July 2008 Agreement,
Claimants agreed to sell their shareholdings in both ARSA and AUSA to Respondent within
60 days. Claimants were to appoint valuators to value each airline on a DCF basis with specific
agreed assumptions as to the cost of fuel and domestic airfares and Respondent was to seek the
same valuations of the Airlines as a whole from the TTN. In the event of differing results, a third
valuation was to be sought from an impartial, experienced and respected valuator.''*? During the
60-day transition period, the Parties were to set up a Transition Board made up of two
representatives of Claimants and two representatives of Respondent to manage the operations of

the Airlines.'!%

The Transition Board was to manage the Airlines and instruct the General
Manager to be appointed by Respondent and it was tasked with providing the necessary
information for the stock transfer and valuation.''** Although Mr. Alak’s appointment was made
pursuant to the July 2008 Agreement, which contemplated that the State-appointed General
Manager would take instructions from a transition committee jointly appointed by Claimants and
Respondent, the evidence indicates that, at some point in time, the General Manager began acting

on his own and was no longer instructed by the Transition Board.

940. On July 21, 2008, Mr. Julio Alak assumed the role of the Airlines’ General Manager. !!*5
Claimants, relying on the testimony of Mr. Mujioz, submit that as of that date, the Government of
Argentina took de facto control over the Airlines.'!° However, the contemporaneous documents

November 12, 2008. On that date, Interinvest wrote to Secretary Jaime to request that the
Transition Committee meet indicating that Argentina’s representatives had not attended any of the
committee’s weekly meetings since October 8, 2008. '137 Tnterinvest indicated that, as a result, Mr.
Julio Alak as General Manager was managing the Airlines without the guidance of the Transition

Committee. !!°

941. The Tribunal agrees that taking over management of an investment constitutes an indirect
expropriation and that there was evidence that Argentina did assume the management of the
investment at some point after the July 2008 Agreement and before the formal expropriation of
Claimants’ shares. In the Tribunal’s view, this amounted to an indirect expropriation. However,
the record is not entirely clear as to precisely when Argentina in fact took over the management of
the Airlines such as to amount to an expropriation. In light of the fact that Argentina proceeded to
formally expropriate Claimants’ shares in the Airlines thereby completing a de jure taking, the
Tribunal does not consider it necessary to determine the precise date at which a de facto taking
occurred. Accordingly, the Tribunal will discuss the consequences flowing from the indirect
expropriation of the Airlines through the takeover of management in the following section on

expropriation.

942. The Tribunal has also considered the events alleged to form part of the creeping
expropriation that took place before July 2008. The expropriatory nature of the other individual
impugned measures preceding the assumption of the day-to-day management is less clear. Having
reviewed the events and found that an indirect expropriation occurred at some point during the
course of events following the July 2008 Agreement, the Tribunal finds it convenient to address

the other components of Claimants’ creeping expropriation claims in chronological order.

943. Claimants argue that the airfare squeeze “gradually emptied the value of Claimants’

investment and enabled the ultimate ‘Argentinization’ (nationalization) of the two airlines at an

orchestrated, artificially-low price.”!'?? Claimants complain that in 2006, Respondent “coerced
Claimants to grant it an option to raise its stake in ARSA, first to 5% and then to 20%.”!"? In
2006, Respondent exercised its first option increasing its shareholding in ARSA from 1.2% to 5%.
Then in 2007, Respondent exercised its second option to increase its ownership to 20%. The
exercise of the second option was never perfected as Respondent failed to make the necessary
capital contribution for the shares. Finally, in 2008, Respondent took full control over the Airlines.
Claimants state that each progressive taking was without any compensation and that Respondent
required Claimants to transfer shares in exchange for promises to increase airfares and approve the
financial statements.''*! Claimants summarize their position as follows:

Argentina’s plan, initiated in late 2004, had finally come to fruition: After years of financial

asphyxiation, instrumentalized by: (i) preventing the Argentine Airlines from charging

economically reasonable airfares; (ii) blocking the adoption of ARSA accounts which, in turn,

prevented the financial expansion of the airlines; and (iii) escalating government-supported union

strikes and unreasonable salary demands leading to social unrest and a near paralysis in the operation

of the airlines, the GOA had essentially eviscerated the value of Claimants’ investment. Formal

expropriation in December 2008 was but the coup de grace, delayed only so as to allow the

authorities to walk away at lower cost. In the end, however, the GOA refused even to pay the

deflated 2008 value of Claimants’ investment. After four years of harassment, unfair treatment and
fraudulent maneuvers, it simply decided not to pay any compensation at all. !!47

 

 
  

944. Claimants argue that a “creeping” expropriation resulted from the series of measures,

which over time substantially impaired the value of the investment, even though each individual

1143

measure standing alone would not appear to amount to expropriation. In support of their

position, Claimants also quote Professors Reisman and Sloane on creeping expropriation:

Discrete acts, analyzed in isolation rather than in the context of the overall flow of events, may,
whether legal or not in themselves, seem innocuous vis-a-vis a potential expropriation. Some may
not be expropriatory in themselves. Only in retrospect will it become evident that those acts
comprised part of an accretion of deleterious acts and omissions, which in the aggregate
expropriated the foreign investor’s property rights. |!

945. Thus, Claimants submit that it is not necessary for each of the measures complained of to
be either illegal or expropriatory in themselves; as long as the measures formed part of a series of
“deleterious acts and omissions, which in the aggregate expropriated the foreign investor’s
property rights.”!'45 Claimants submit that the tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina similarly defined
creeping expropriation and it noted that “[o]bviously, each step must have an adverse effect but by

itself may not be significant or considered an illegal act.”!!#°

946. In specific response to the allegations that the measures constituted a creeping
expropriation (beyond those already discussed above in the context of Claimants’ FET claims),

Respondent submits:

(a) that the increase in Respondent’s participation in the Airlines was related to an
agreement entered into between Argentina and Interinvest, which was never
challenged by the parties and no coercion or duress was ever invoked in relation to

its execution. Further, Respondent emphasizes that Government of Argentina made

contributions for the payment of the companies’ fuel and wages;!!47

(b) that there was no evidence that any of the agreements entered into between

Interinvest and Argentina were entered into under coercion; !'48

(c) that even in a creeping expropriation the final result of each measure must be an

actual expropriation or deprivation of property rights;!'*? and

(d) that the impact required to give rise to a finding of expropriation must be

substantial, ie. an alleged partial reduction in the value of the shares does not

amount to expropriation. !!°°

947. As a result, Respondent submits that there was no creeping expropriation and that its
expropriation in December 2008 was lawful.!!>!

948. As just summarized, the Parties disagree as to whether, in order to prove that a creeping
expropriation occurred, the final result of each individual measure must be an actual expropriation
or deprivation of property rights. The Tribunal agrees that the relevant focus of the inquiry for this
purpose is the effect or result of the measure, as opposed to the purpose for which each measure
was undertaken. A creeping expropriation is a particular type of indirect expropriation, which
requires an inquiry into the particular facts. The use of the term “creeping” to describe this type of
expropriation indicates that the entirety of the measures should be reviewed in the aggregate to
determine their effect on the investment rather than each individual measure on its own. As

summarized by Reisman and Sloane:

A creeping expropriation therefore denotes, in the paradigmatic case, an expropriation accomplished
by a cumulative series of regulatory acts or omissions over a prolonged period of time, no one of
which can necessarily be identified as the decisive event that deprived the foreign national of the
value of its investment. Moreover, they may be interspersed with entirely lawful state regulatory
actions. By definition, then, creeping expropriations lack the vividness and transparency not only
of formal expropriations, but also of many regulatory or otherwise indirect expropriations, which
may be identified more closely with a few discrete events. The gradual and sometimes furtive nature
of the acts and omissions that culminate in a creeping expropriation tends to obscure what tribunals

ordinarily denominate the ‘moment of expropriation’ .!!*

  

949. However, it is still necessary for the individual measures to culminate in a taking or
deprivation of property rights. The Tribunal has found that the takeover of the day-to-day
management of the Airlines was an indirect expropriation; it was a substantial and permanent
deprivation of property rights. This event was expropriatory on its own even without reference to
the earlier impugned events. In the Tribunal’s view, a substantial and permanent deprivation of
property rights did not occur until the events of 2008. In order to conclude that a creeping
expropriation took place, the Tribunal must conclude that the earlier impugned events formed part

of the chain of events that led to the eventual substantial and permanent deprivation of property

rights. In the circumstances of this case, the same measures are alleged to form the basis of both

the FET claim and the creeping expropriation claim. The measures have already been reviewed

in detail in the context of the FET claims in the previous section. Accordingly, the Tribunal will

return to these only in a summary fashion here:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

The “airfare squeeze” - the Tribunal has found that although airfares were not
sufficient to cover the costs of airline operators and provide a rate of return, this did
not amount to a breach of the FET standard. Further, the Secretariat of
Transportation considered the requests for increases and did grant a number of

increases; !!53

The “serious conflict of interests” posed by Undersecretary Cirielli - the Tribunal
has found that while Mr. Cirielli may have had an unfavorable view of the Spanish
ownership of the Airlines, Claimants have not demonstrated that Mr. Cirielli’s
views or his conflict of interest caused the breach or impairment of the Airlines’
rights; !!54

The acts taken by the “government-supported” air transportation unions - the
Tribunal has found that Claimants have not demonstrated that the Government

controlled or sponsored the transportation unions or their strikes; !!°°

Respondent’s acts with respect to the June 2006 Agreement, including
Respondent’s coercion of Claimants to obtain additional shares at no cost, its
unilateral modification of the text of the June 2006 Agreement, and its breach of
the June 2006 Agreement by failing to set TER-compliant airfares and contributing
to the promised 15% stock option of ARSA - the Tribunal is not persuaded that
Respondent coerced Claimants to accept the June 2006 Agreement nor that

Respondent breached that agreement. Although Respondent did not contribute to

Respondent; 1156

(e) Respondent’s “lowball purchase offer,’ made by de facto Government
representatives in early 2008 - while Respondent may have encouraged or
facilitated the approach by Mr. Llorente, the Tribunal has been unable to conclude
that the approach was made by de facto representatives of the Government or that

the approach was an attempt to force out Claimants; !!*” and

(f) Respondent’s failure to comply with the May 2008 Agreement - the Tribunal has
found that neither Respondent nor Interinvest breached the May 2008

Agreement. !!98

950. In light of these findings, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that a creeping expropriation
of Claimants’ investment occurred. In most instances, Claimants’ underlying factual premises
have not been made out. While Claimants have demonstrated that the conduct they complain of
culminated in a deprivation of Claimants’ rights of ownership, they have not demonstrated that

there was a link between the individual measures and the ultimate taking.

951. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that an indirect expropriation took place following the July
2008 Agreement, but that the Claimants have failed to make out their claim for creeping
expropriation. Since there are also claims of unlawful expropriation, whether the indirect
expropriatory acts that preceded the formal expropriation in December 2008 were unlawful will

be discussed in the wider context of the claims related to the formal expropriation.

A. Did Respondent Expropriate Claimants’ Investment?

953. As set out at paragraph 951, above, the Tribunal has determined that an indirect
expropriation took place following the July 2008 Agreement, once Respondent took over the
management of the Airlines when Mr. Alak continued to act as General Manager without reporting
to the Transition Committee and following the injunction proceedings in the Argentine courts and
the injunction of November 21, 2008. For completeness, the Tribunal will briefly set out the events

related to the direct expropriation of Claimants’ investment.

1. Argentine Judicial Expropriation Proceedings

954. After Interinvest rejected the TTN’s January 2009 valuation prepared pursuant to Law
No. 26,466 (see paragraphs 841 to 844, above), the Government of Argentina filed an
expropriation lawsuit against Interinvest with the Argentine judiciary. On February 27, 2014, the
Argentine Federal Administrative Court rendered its decision on expropriation against Interinvest.
The decision perfected the expropriation of the shares by confirming the rejection of Interinvest’s

request for compensation and by transferring the title to the shares.!'>?

955. Respondent criticizes Interinvest’s participation in the Argentine legal proceedings. It
asserts that in answering the court complaint, Interinvest raised “generic objections” to Law No.
26,466, but did not specifically question the constitutionality of the act or the declaration of public
interest or the non-discriminatory nature of the expropriation. !!° Respondent asserts that after the
judge requested a valuation from the TTN, as required under the Expropriation Law, Interinvest
was entitled to appoint a member to the TTN, ensuring an adequate right of defense.''®! However,
Respondent alleges that Interinvest forfeited this right by failing to appoint a qualified
individual.''® Upon the TTN’s report valuing the Airlines at ARS - 3.275 billion, Interinvest
protested the valuation, arguing that the valuation was not fair and that the assessment methods

used were not compatible with international standards. However, according to Respondent,

Interinvest did not question the TTN’s compliance with Law No. 21,499, the Law on

Expropriation.

956. Respondent also argues that throughout the pendency of the lawsuit, Interinvest needlessly

delayed the court proceedings by petitioning for the suspension of proceedings and by failing to

produce documentary evidence required by the judge. !!°
957. Finally, Respondent argues that
[T]he fact that Clai: ts—thi h their led company Interinvest—had the ity to

 

object to the rules on expropriation and to the conclusion of the valuation in the case of
expropriation, but deliberately chose not to do so, renders any challenge to those measures in this
arbitration inadmissible. Claimants cannot assert something that is contrary to their own actions and
adopt a legal position that is inconsistent with that taken at the expropriation proceedings (especially,
without providing any justification for such change of mind). !"*

958. In response, Claimants argue that Interinvest did in fact raise the argument, during the
Argentine proceedings, that Law. No. 26,466 and the subsequent measures taken by Argentina
were unconstitutional.!!©> However, they note that “in 100 years of the Argentine Supreme Court
case law dealing with expropriation cases, there was not one declaration of unconstitutionality of
either the general expropriation statute or the relevant individual expropriations approved by
Congress under such statute.”!'® Claimants also point to what they allege is “the Argentine
judiciary’s lack of independence and vulnerability to political pressure.” !'®7 Claimants allege that
the judge granted Interinvest only five days to challenge the TTN’s new report, after the TTN had

180 work days to prepare the report. !!°8

959. Finally, Claimants concede that they requested suspension of the lawsuit, however, they
assert that their request was justified because “[i]n the context of intense settlement negotiations
between the parties that would have put an end to that local proceeding, it was entirely reasonable

for Interinvest to request the suspension of the local expropriation proceeding initiated by the

Tribunal and arbitration in order to obtain compensation.!!7°

2. Investment Directly and Indirectly Expropriated

960. As set out at paragraph 951, above, the Tribunal has determined that an indirect
expropriation took place following the July 2008 Agreement, once Respondent had taken over the
management of the Airlines following injunction proceedings in the Argentine courts. That
Respondent also formally expropriated Claimants’ shares in the Airlines in December 2008
through Law 26,466 is not disputed. !'”! The Tribunal pauses to note that it is possible, as occurred
in the circumstances of this case, for a State to both indirectly and directly expropriate the same
investment by different measures. The Tribunal notes that Claimants claim that both takings were
unlawful, but did not argue that they should be treated separately in the analysis of whether the
taking of shares complied with the expropriation provisions of the Treaty. Accordingly, in this
section of the Award, the Tribunal will determine whether the expropriation of Claimants’

investment was in accordance with the Treaty in light of the events of late 2008.

961. As has been discussed in detail in previous sections of this award, !!7? Claimants and
Respondent had reached an agreement in May 2008 whereby Claimants would reduce their
shareholdings in the Airlines by selling their shares to Respondent, employees and other private
investors. The private investor walked away from the deal leaving Claimants and Respondent to

negotiate a different solution to the Airlines’ distress.

962. Through the July 2008 Agreement, Claimants agreed to sell their shareholdings in both
ARSA and AUSA to Respondent following a 60 day transition period. Claimants were to appoint
valuators to value each airline on a DCF basis with specific agreed assumptions as to the cost of

fuel and domestic airfares and Respondent was to seek the same valuations of the Airlines as a

whole from the TTN.'!? In the event of differing results, a third valuation was to be sought from
an impartial, experienced and respected valuator.'!’* During the 60-day transition period, the
Parties were to set up a Transition Board made up of two representatives of Claimants and two
representatives of Respondent to manage the operations of the Airlines.'!'”> The Transition Board
was to manage the Airlines and instruct the General Manager appointed by Respondent. It was
tasked with ensuring the performance of various tasks by the Parties, including the provision of

necessary information, in order to perfect the purchase and sale of the shares.!!7®

963. On July 21, 2008, Mr. Julio Alak assumed the role of the Airlines’ General Manager.!!77
Claimants, relying on the testimony of Mr. Mujfioz Pérez, submit that as of that date, the

Government of Argentina took de facto control over the Airlines.!!78

However, the
contemporaneous documents indicate that Interinvest did not complain about the functioning of
the Transition Committee until November 12, 2008. On that date, Interinvest wrote to Secretary
Jaime to request that the Transition Committee meet indicating that Argentina’s representatives
had not attended any of the committee’s weekly meetings since October 8, 2008.!!”° Interinvest
indicated that, as a result, Mr. Julio Alak as General Manager was managing the Airlines without

the guidance of the Transition Committee. !!*°

964. As discussed above, the Tribunal agrees that taking over management of an investment can
constitute expropriation of an investment and that there was evidence that Argentina did assume
the management of the investment at some point after the July 2008 Agreement and before the
formal expropriation of Claimants’ shares. The Tribunal has concluded that in seeking and
obtaining the injunction that prevented the removal of Mr. Alak as General Manager, Respondent

indirectly expropriated Claimants’ investment. However, the Tribunal does not agree with

Claimants’ position that this was a direct expropriation. In the Tribunal’s view, a de facto taking,
without a transfer of title or physical seizure of the investment, is not a direct expropriation. The
classification of the expropriation as direct versus indirect has no consequence for the Tribunal’s
analysis as to its lawfulness, as Article V of the Treaty sets out Respondent’s obligations with
respect to both direct and indirect expropriation, which are identical. What is relevant is whether
the takeover of the day-to-day management of the investment was done in accordance with Article

V of the Treaty.

965. In addition, in light of the fact that Argentina proceeded to formally expropriate Claimants’
shares in the Airlines thereby completing a de jure taking of the investment by separate measures,
it is necessary to review the events surrounding the takings in order to determine whether they

were carried out in accordance with the Treaty.

B. The Standard for Lawful Expropriation

966. Claimants’ arguments with respect to unlawful expropriation relate to their claims of both

direct and indirect expropriation, which rely on Article V of the Treaty, which provides:

Nationalization, expropriation or any other measure having similar characteristics or effects that
might be adopted by the authorities of one Party against investments made in its territory by
investors of the other Party shall be effected only in the public interest, in accordance with the law,
and shall in no case be discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay the investor or
his assignee appropriate compensation without undue delay and in freely convertible currency.

 

967. Respondent agrees that Article V of the Treaty governs expropriation. '!*!

968. Article V of the Treaty provides that, in order for expropriation to be lawful: i) it must be
affected in the public interest; ii) it must be carried out in accordance with the law; iii) it must not

be discriminatory; and iv) it must be accompanied by appropriate compensation.

969. Claimants allege that Respondent unlawfully expropriated Claimants’ shares in the
Airlines in 2008, in violation of Article V of the Treaty. Claimants’ specific arguments relate to

various omissions and acts taken by Respondent in the expropriation process. In summary,

481 Resp. CM 4816.

Claimants assert that Respondent failed to pay adequate compensation; '’** that the expropriation

was not in the public interest;!!8?

that the expropriation was unlawful because it violated due
process, the Argentine Constitution, and Argentina’s statutory obligations;''* and that the
expropriation was discriminatory.''*> In addition, Claimants argue that Respondent, at the time of
the taking, was of the view that some compensation was owed to Claimants and that Respondent’s
failed promise to subrogate Claimants’ Airbus orders, which would have compensated Claimants
for their expropriated investment in the amount of USD 366-466 million, was also unlawful.!!%°
Claimants submit that the unlawfulness of the expropriation is crucial in this arbitration, as it
determines the date of valuation (date of the award) as well as the damages to which Claimants

are entitled. !!87
970. Respondent strenuously denies that the expropriation was unlawful.

971. The factual background relating to Claimants’ claims for expropriation has been set out in
detail in section V, above, and further discussed in the Tribunal’s analysis of Claimants’ claims
for breaches of the FET standard and creeping expropriation. Accordingly, this discussion will
not be repeated in this section of the award and the factual background will only be set out to the

extent it is necessary to review it in analyzing the lawfulness of the expropriation claims.

Cc. “Only in the public interest”
1. Positions of the Parties

972. Claimants assert that the expropriation was unlawful because it was not in the public
interest. According to Claimants, Respondent’s alleged desire stated in Law No. 26,466 “to
guarantee continuity and safety in the provision of the public service of commercial air
transportation, the protection of the workers’ jobs and the preservation of the assets of the airlines”

runs against its own actions. !'*® Claimants assert that if Respondent had truly wanted to ensure the

continuity and safety of the Airlines’ operations, it would not have refused to raise airfares,
appointed Undersecretary Cirielli, challenged ARSA’s financial statements or failed to grant the
promised tax benefits and subsidies.!'!*? According to Claimants, these acts by Respondent put the
Airlines into their difficult situation in 2008.!!°°

973. Claimants argue that international law requires that expropriation only be carried out when
it is necessary to serve the “public interest”.''!°! Claimants refer to various expressions of a genuine

public interest as “overriding purely individual or private interests”!!??

or “a bona fide public
purpose”.!!°3 Claimants submit that it is not sufficient for Argentina to declare that the Airlines’
shares were of public interest - Respondent must demonstrate that its expropriation was in the

iio

public interes and the Tribunal must determine that there was some genuine interest of the

public. !!°5

974. Further, Claimants argue that the particular wording of the Treaty that expropriation be
effected “only in the public interest” increases the burden of proof on Argentina to demonstrate
that the expropriation was solely in the public interest.''®® In this vein, to the extent that the stated
public interest was connectivity of remote areas by commercial air transport routes, Claimants
assert that Respondent could have taken other measures to guarantee continuity of flights; namely,

a state-owned airline called Lineas Aéreas del Estado.!!°7

975. Claimants’ argument with respect to the public interest is encapsulated in the following

submission:

In the present case, there is no apparent reason why the GOA must own what were previously private
airlines. Lest it be forgotten, this is not a case in which the GOA privatized public utilitie:
water or electricity supply and subsequently withdrew the concession for supply of certain public
services. In this dispute, no public utility or service is at stake. What were expropriated were shares

other, privately-held airlines. 1"

976. Claimants state that “any ‘public interest’ related to purely commercial air transportation
would have been much better served if the GOA would simply have abided by its own rules and
guarantees...[t]here was simply no need for an expropriation as higher tariff caps, subsidies and
other compensation...could have ended the strikes and put the airlines back on track.”!!”
Claimants note that these measures were taken by Respondent after it took control of the

Airlines. !7°°

977. Claimants argue that it is “particularly troubling” that Respondent also expropriated
AUSA, a private airline for domestic and regional flights, in which it was not previously a
shareholder along with the shares of ARSA, the original, state-owned airline of Argentina.'7°! In
their reply, Claimants also note that Respondent expropriated their shareholdings in Optar SA, Jet
Paq SA, Aerohandling SA and Air Patagonia SA, all of which provide services other than airline

1202

transportation. Claimants submit that the question under the Treaty is whether the measure

enacted was in the public interest, not whether the underlying sector of activity constitutes a public

service. !203

978. Respondent argues that regular air transportation is a public service,!* and that the

Argentine Republic had a very clear public interest in ensuring the connectivity of the country. !?°

Respondent points to the third recital in the July 2008 Agreement, which refers to the duty of the

is therefore undeniable that there were public interest reasons for the expropriation.!?
Respondent submits that even Claimants recognize this when they accept that “[t]he Tribunal must
grant the State a measure of deference in determining whether expropriation is in the public

21210

interest’ and that Claimants’ expert, Dr. Bianchi, confirmed that air transportation is a public

service. !?!!

979. Respondent says that “[t]his does not mean that the Tribunal must accept the declaration
of public interest contained in Article 1 of Argentine Law No. 26,466 as absolutely conclusive for
the purpose of the BIT, but that: i) the threshold for determining that there were no public interest
reasons is high (and was not met by Claimants), and ii) it is not for this Tribunal to consider
whether the measure was the best one bearing in mind the public interest involved, but to assess,
with the degree of deference referred to above, whether Claimants have successfully demonstrated

that there were no public interest reasons.” !?!7

980. Respondent asserts that Claimants “did not comply with the Argentine regulatory and
company laws by engaging in a conduct that was terribly detrimental to the Argentine
Airlines.”!?'3 As a result, the Argentine State was forced “to take control of an airline that was
totally abandoned, which, in turn, implied a risk for the country’s connectivity.”!?!4 Respondent
argues that expropriation “was the only viable alternative left in order to ensure the continued and
uninterrupted provision of the public service and connectivity in the country, considering the
circumstances and, particularly, the behaviour of the Marsans Group with respect to the Airlines,

which led to a situation of actual collapse.”!'> Respondent therefore asserts that this is a case of

981. In specific response to Claimants’ argument that Respondent’s expropriation of AUSA
could not have been in the public interest as it had never been the flag carrier, Respondent says
that the origin of the company is irrelevant to the declaration of public interest and that “it cannot

be seriously argued that [AUSA] and [ARSA] were two separate companies[.]”!?!7

982. Respondent disputes Claimants’ arguments that rather than resorting to expropriation of
the Airlines, the state-owned Lineas Aéreas del Estado could have taken over the Airlines’ routes
to ensure continuing service. Respondent makes two submissions. First, Respondent submits that
this airline does not present a viable alternative, as it is limited in its fleet and staff, and would not
be in a position to take over the Airlines’ routes.!?!® Second, Respondent says that this argument
is also legally irrelevant, as there is no “only way” standard that applies to expropriation for a

public purpose. '?!°

2. Tribunal’s Analysis

983. For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent has adequately
demonstrated that its expropriation of the shares of the Airlines (and their related entities) was

done in the public interest.

984. As submitted by both Parties, the analysis of whether the expropriation was in the public
interest must go beyond a State’s declaration. In this case, the fact that the Airlines provided a
public service was not in dispute. As is clear from the discussion elsewhere in this award, the
entire regulatory regime is premised on air transport being a public service. In addition,
Respondent consistently treated the Airlines’ services as not only providing a public service, but
also serving the identified public interest of connectivity. Argentina’s geography makes regular
air transport services for passengers and cargo necessary to ensure connectivity of remote areas
within the country. The Tribunal considers the stated and demonstrated need for connectivity in

Argentina to be a genuine public interest that overrides purely individual or private interests. !?”°

The evidence suggests that, although ultimately inadequate in the execution of measures,
Respondent recognized the need to provide for higher airfares and other assistance for Airlines
facing higher costs in order to maintain the industry as a whole, but also to ensure that lesser
trafficked routes continued to have service despite their commercial unattractiveness. Respondent
also provided bail out funds in 2008 in order to keep the Airlines in operation, which lends support
to the conclusion that the Airlines provided an important public service and that Government of
Argentina had an interest in their continued operation. In this context, the Tribunal is of the view
that Respondent’s decision to expropriate the Airlines’ shares and to continue operating the

Airlines were steps taken in the bona fide public interest to preserve connectivity.

985. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has noted and considered Claimants’ arguments
with respect to whether there were other measures (short of expropriation of the Airlines) that
Respondent could have taken in furtherance of its public interest and that the expropriation was
not “only” in the public interest. The Tribunal agrees that a State must be accorded a certain
amount of deference in determining how to best advance its public interest once a public interest
has been demonstrated as the reason for which an expropriation occurred. Further, there is no
requirement at international law that expropriation, in order to be in the public interest, must be
the only means available for the State to meet that interest. Moreover, there is also no requirement
that the entity being expropriated had to have previously been a State-owned entity. In light of the
substantial proportion of the domestic market served by ARSA and AUSA and their ongoing
financial difficulties, it was reasonable for Respondent to expropriate both airlines to ensure that

the public interest of connectivity continued to be served.

986. In summary, the Tribunal declines to find that the expropriation was not in the public
interest. Claimants’ challenge to the lawfulness of the expropriation on the basis that it was not in

the public interest is rejected.

D. “In accordance with the law”
1. Positions of the Parties

987. Claimants make several arguments to support their assertion that Respondent’s

expropriation of the Airlines was not “in accordance with the law.”

988. Claimants submit that Respondent’s alleged creeping expropriation was not in accordance
with the law. As discussed above at paragraphs 928 to 951, Claimants argue that from October
2004 to December 2008, Respondent’s measures amounted to a creeping expropriation of their
investment. Claimants argue that the measures constituting this alleged creeping expropriation
violated Argentine law, including statutory rights and contractually agreed commitments and were

contrary to basic principles of due process. !27!

989. In support of this aspect of their unlawful expropriation claim, Claimants import and rely
upon their claims of breach of the FET standard as conduct “a fortiori conduct not ‘in accordance
with the law’”.!???_ Claimants also say that in disregarding its contractual obligations under the
July 2008 Agreement for a third-party valuation in the event of disagreement between valuations
and in subsequently relying on the TTN “who had already found that the airlines were worthless”,
their basic due process rights were violated resulting in Respondent failing to expropriate the
investment “in accordance with the law”.'223 Further, in connection with this argument, Claimants
assert that the Credit Suisse valuation they submitted fully complied with the provisions of the

July 2008 Agreement, and that Respondent's rejection of their valuation was groundless. '?*+

990. Claimants also argue that Respondent breached the July 2008 Agreement by failing to
conduct a valuation (through the TTN) that was carried out in accordance with the agreed valuation
parameters set out in the July 2008 Agreement.!”5 Claimants submit that the TTN also failed to

value the proper subject matter - instead of valuing the shares that Respondent was expropriating,

the TTN valued the personal and real property of the Airlines. !?° Claimants say this amounted to

a ‘constitutional irregularity’ that tainted the entire process. '??7

991. Further, Claimants argue that Law No. 26,412, which was enacted on September 18, 2008,
the so-called “bail-out” law, was in breach of Argentine law.'?8 Law No. 26,412 approved
Respondent’s “repossession” of the Airlines with compensation to be calculated by the TTN and,
in effect, approved the July 2008 Agreement. !?”? In particular, Claimants submit that Law 26,412
was contrary to section 17 of the Argentine Constitution, which requires compensation before
expropriation and abolishes the confiscation of property by the state, including the forced sale of
property.'?°° Claimants say that Respondent never paid full compensation for the expropriated

shares and thus the expropriation was not in accordance with the law.

992. In addition, Claimants argue that Law No. 26,466 was also unlawful, as Respondent
unlawfully circumvented its constitutional and statutory obligations to pay compensation before
taking the property by ordering the “abnormal temporary occupation” of the Airlines’ shares to

effectively formalize the de facto control it already had.'?*!

993. Finally, Claimants argue that the formal expropriation of the shares was not in accordance

with the law, as Respondent violated due process by failing to provide for an independent valuation

of the Airlines. !7°

994. In response to Claimants’ arguments relating to the alleged creeping expropriation,
Respondent submits that it fully complied with the laws in force from 2004 to 2008.'° In effect,
Respondent says that there was no creeping expropriation, much less an unlawful one. Respondent

also points out that “[t]he Argentine Republic has never had - and does not have - any contractual

commitment to Claimants.”!?*4 Accordingly, Respondent argues that it has no obligations to

Claimants arising from either contract or the Treaty.

995. Respondent argues that the due process of law requirement under the Treaty requires an
applicable legal procedure regarding the expropriation that allows the affected party to have its
claim heard and that such procedure must be followed! and that the “in accordance with the
law” standard refers to “the specifically-relevant law of the state whose expropriation is
challenged.”!?° By this standard, Respondent argues that the expropriation of Claimants’ shares
was conducted in accordance with the laws in force at the time of the expropriation—laws that had
been in place before Claimants took control of the Airlines and remained unaltered during their
tenure.!?°7 Respondent cites Kardassopolous v. Georgia in support of its position:

The Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the ADC tribunal and, in particular, with the proposition

that whatever the legal mechanism or procedure put in to place, it “must be of a nature to grant an

affected investor a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have
its claims heard” if it is to be found to have been carried out under due process of the law. !758

996. Respondent says that the legal system in force in Argentina embraces these principles and
was complied with. Respondent submits that “[t]his fact has not been seriously questioned by
Interinvest, which is controlled by Claimants, which are - in turn - party to these proceedings.” !?°°
Respondent asserts, moreover, that Interinvest decided not to argue, during the course of the
Argentine judicial proceedings, that the expropriation process was not conducted in accordance
with the law. Respondent asserts that this alone is reason for this Tribunal to dismiss Claimants’

expropriation claim. !24°

997. Respondent submits that within the framework of the Expropriation Law and Argentine
Law No. 26,466, the TTN was to value the asset expropriated and that this valuation was carried

out in accordance with the applicable rules.'*4! Respondent says that the use of a different method

than the DCF method for estimating the value of a company with negative shareholders’ equity
has been recognized in international arbitration, by the World Bank Guidelines and by SEPI in

relation to the Airlines in 2001.!24

998. With respect to Claimants’ other allegations, Respondent argues that the July 2008

Agreement was not part of the law applicable to the expropriation process!?43

and that, in any
event, it was Claimants, and not Respondent, that failed to follow the requirements for the
valuation under the July 2008 Agreement, thereby breaching the Agreement. Specifically,
Respondent argues that Interinvest continually breached its obligations under the July 2008

Agreement to disclose information and to provide signed copies of the required documents. !?4

999. Inreply, Claimants submit that Interinvest’s failure to participate in the local expropriation
proceeding in 2009 was a result of its request for a suspension of those proceedings in favor of
intense settlement discussions ongoing at the time. Claimants also say that their decision was
justified by “the Argentine judiciary’s lack of independence and vulnerability to political
pressure”. !*45 Further, Claimants submit that it was reasonable for Interinvest not to participate in
proceedings before the TTN because it was not an independent body and did not have the expertise

the TTN had as their sole purpose to value the Airlines in complete disregard of the July 2008

Agreement, pursuant to which they had already challenged the TTN’s valuation reports. !747

request the invalidation of the expropriation before the Argentine courts entails acquiescence to
that measure and leads to inadmissibility of the claim submitted in the arbitration. !*4* Respondent

of the company cannot be allowed to invoke such invalidity in an arbitration proceeding.” '? In
addition, Respondent disputes Claimants’ allegation that the Argentine courts were not

independent and notes that Claimants did not submit any evidence in support of their assertion.

2. Tribunal’s Analysis

1001. The Tribunal begins its analysis by noting that in the circumstances of this case in order to
determine whether the expropriation was “in accordance with the law”, it must consider the process
for both the indirect taking of the investment and the process for the direct taking of the investment
through Law 26,466. The Parties agree that the “law” in issue for this branch of the test under the
Treaty is Argentine law and the requirements of due process. An expropriation that is carried out
in accordance with the local law will satisfy this branch of the test, but may still be unlawful at

international law if the other conditions for lawful expropriation have not been met.

1002. Turning first to Law 26,466 and the process for the direct expropriation of Interinvest’s
shares, the Tribunal notes that the evidence indicates that the law provided for expropriation in
accordance with the provisions of the Expropriation Law. Claimants did not seriously dispute that
the expropriation process provided Interinvest with a legal procedure that granted it “‘a reasonable
chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard”.
Regarding the direct expropriation process, the evidence demonstrates that Interinvest was
afforded the opportunity to claim its rights before the Argentine courts and to have its claims heard.
It appears that Claimants could have done so within a reasonable time and, in fact, Interinvest
chose to seek a suspension of those proceedings to provide time for settlement negotiations to

continue.

1003. Claimants’ arguments in this respect focused on the provision of Law 26,466 that allowed
Respondent to effect an “abnormal temporary occupation” of the shares, thus circumventing the
constitutional obligation to pay compensation before a taking. Both Parties submitted expert
opinion evidence on the Argentine law of expropriation and agreed that Government of

Argentina’s power to expropriate is limited by the Argentine Constitution. In the ordinary course

of expropriation proceedings in Argentina, in the event of a disagreement as to the value of the
property being taken, Government of Argentina may take possession of the property once it has
made a deposit of the value as determined by a tribunal. !7°° However, as Professor Mata explained,
“the State is empowered, in its capacity as the conceding authority, to directly provide any public
service in situations where its continuity or regularity is compromised.”!?°!_ While Claimants’
expert, Professor Bianchi, challenges Government of Argentina’s selection of the use of an
“abnormal temporary occupation” for this purpose, he did not challenge Government of
Argentina’s ability to order temporary occupation. It was not shown that Respondent selected this
method of occupation in order to circumvent Constitutional guarantees for compensation to be
paid in advance. In addition, the evidence indicates that at the time Law 26,466 was passed
Respondent had been advised that the Airlines had negative shareholders’ equity. Whether or not
this was correct, in these circumstances, it does not seem unreasonable for Government of
Argentina to have proceeded on the basis of an abnormal temporary occupation pending the final
valuation of the shares through the formal expropriation process. The formal expropriation as
commenced by Law 26,466 and the process that followed appears to have been in accordance with

Argentine law.

1004. The Tribunal finds that Claimants’ argument that the local process, which allegedly did not
provide for independent valuation, was in violation of due process is also without merit. While
the TTN was a government-appointed body and therefore not “independent” of the government,
the evidence indicated that the valuation process allows an affected party to challenge the TTN’s
valuations and submit its own evidence of value. The Tribunal considers this ability to provide

for due process such that this element of the expropriation was also in accordance with the law.

1005. The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s admissibility argument: that Claimants could
not argue in this arbitration that the expropriation was not in accordance with the law because
Interinvest did not challenge the lawfulness of the expropriation before the Argentine courts.

Respondent has not pointed to any requirement in the Treaty that the investor must have

participated in and challenged the legality of the local proceedings in order to be able to argue that
the expropriation was not in accordance with the law pursuant to the Treaty. While the failure to
raise arguments in the local expropriation proceedings can cause practical issues when asking an
international tribunal to assess whether those proceedings were in accordance with the local law,

this does not affect the admissibility of the arguments or claims in the arbitration.

1006. Turning next to Claimants’ claims that the alleged creeping expropriation was not in
accordance with the law, the Tribunal simply notes that Claimants have failed to make out their
claims of creeping expropriation. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider those

measures and whether they were in accordance with the law.

1007. Finally, the Tribunal turns to Claimants’ claims that the indirect expropriation of
Interinvest’s shares was not in accordance with the law. Claimants’ main arguments in this respect
are that the failure to accord the investment fair and equitable treatment is expropriation not in
accordance with the law; that Respondent failed to carry out the valuation agreed to in the July
2008 Agreement; that Respondent’s rejection of the Credit Suisse valuation was groundless; and

that the TTN valued the wrong asset.

1008. Respondent takes the position that the July 2008 Agreement (and Law 26,412) were not
parts of the law applicable to the expropriation process and thus are irrelevant to a determination

of whether the expropriation was conducted in accordance with the law.

1009. The Tribunal cannot agree with this position. The Tribunal has found that Respondent
indirectly expropriated the Airlines by taking over the day-to-day management before it passed
Law 26,466 purporting to directly expropriate the shares. In order to determine whether that
indirect expropriation was in accordance with the law, it would not be appropriate to have recourse
to the Expropriation Law, which was not the process by which Respondent indirectly took the
investment. Accordingly, for the determination of whether the indirect expropriation was in
accordance with the law, it is necessary to review whether Respondent’s measures following the
July 2008 Agreement met the requirements of due process and were in accordance with Argentine

law.

1010. As an initial matter, Claimants have made out their claim of breach of FET, as it relates to
Respondent’s measures following the July 2008 Agreement. In particular, Respondent’s lack of
transparency in agreeing to the July 2008 Agreement, passing Law 26,412 which resulted in the
TTN applying a valuation methodology that was inconsistent with that agreed to in the July 2008
Agreement and its arbitrary decision to expropriate the investment rather than proceed to a third-
party valuation as agreed, have all been found to be a breach of the FET obligations. The Tribunal
finds that Respondent’s breach of the FET obligations also meant that the indirect expropriation
of the investment was not in accordance with the law. Further, Claimants have demonstrated that,
according to Argentine law, the July 2008 Agreement created a vested right to a DCF valuation of
their shares, which they had agreed to sell to Respondent and that, as a result, Respondent’s failure
to carry out that valuation and instead indirectly expropriate the investment was also not in

accordance with the law.

1011. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s expropriation of the shares was not in

accordance with the law.

E. “Shall in no case be discriminatory”
1. Positions of the Parties

1012. Claimants assert that the expropriation of the Airlines was also discriminatory.!*°? In
support of this argument, Claimants return to many of the allegations that also feature in their FET
claims. Claimants submit that other airlines received more favorable treatment in the form of fuel
subsidies and approval of new international routes. They also say that their investment in the
Airlines was singled out for expropriation because ARSA was the former flag carrier now in

foreign hands.

1013. Regarding more favorable treatment, Claimants assert that Respondent provided fuel
subsidies of between 70 - 100% for flights to Santa Fe to Sol, one of ARSA’s and AUSA’s

1253

competitors, and that similar subsidies were not provided to the Airlines despite the fact that

the stated purpose of the subsidies was to address the escalating cost of jet fuel and the issues this

caused for the airline industry.'*+ A second example of alleged discrimination raised by

Claimants is evidenced by a 2006 report of the Argentine Chamber of Tourism. That report
indicates that the only step taken by Respondent to address the emergency situation in the airline
industry was the subsidization of fuel for one of ARSA’s and AUSA’s competitors, Southern
Winds, which operated in cooperation with LAFSA.!*°> This report criticizes the Government for

using public funds to assist one carrier and not others.

1014. In their initial memorial, Claimants also alleged that Respondent approved new
international routes for other airlines but not the Airlines and that this was discriminatory.
Claimants did not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support this allegation and its
argument in this regard was not developed in its later pleadings. As a result, the Tribunal will not

address this particular aspect of Claimants’ discriminatory expropriation claim any further.

1015. Claimants assert that Respondent’s hostility towards the Airlines under Claimants’ control
was due to its desire to “re-Argentinize” the Airlines and remove them from the control of a

Spanish owner.'2*° Claimants submit that “[a]n expropriation ‘that singles out aliens generally, or

aliens of a particular nationality, or particular aliens, would violate international law.’”!?°7

discriminatory. !?°*

1016. Respondent rejects Claimants’ assertions on discrimination, arguing that there was no
discrimination during the expropriation proceedings, which were conducted for the sole purpose
of ensuring the provision of a public service.!? Moreover, Respondent submits that Claimants
did not even attempt to demonstrate that there were other airlines in a similar situation to their
own, which would be necessary to prove allegations of discrimination.'? Finally, Respondent
says that if they were of the view that the expropriation was discriminatory, Claimants were free

to challenge this in the Argentine courts and that their failure to do so is telling. °°!

1017. In support for its position that there was no discrimination, Respondent suggests that the
successful entry of LAN into the Argentine market is evidence that airfares were sufficient and
that there was no discriminatory treatment toward Claimants. In reply, Claimants argue that
Respondent failed to increase airfares despite repeated requests, that this refusal resulted in the
financial strangulation of the Airlines. Further, Claimants submit that LAN could not be directly
compared to ARSA and AUSA because it proposed air services only with respect to the busiest
and most profitable routes. Claimants also note that LAN registered a positive net income in 2008,

but that its income was negative from 2005 to 2007.!7°

1018. In reply to Respondent’s position that Claimants could and should have made their
discrimination arguments in the Argentine courts, Claimants say that Interinvest did participate in

the domestic expropriation proceedings and challenged Government of Argentina’s allegations

2. Tribunal’s Analysis

1019. In analyzing whether the expropriations were unlawful because they were discriminatory,
the Tribunal must focus on the expropriations themselves and the evidence surrounding them.
Claimants’ arguments that Respondent discriminated against them in providing subsidies to
competitors but not the Airlines relate to measures found not to have been linked to the
expropriation of the investment.'? In order to make out this element of their claim, Claimants
must demonstrate that Respondent expropriated their investment in a discriminatory manner.
Discrimination requires differential treatment of Claimants’ investment from other similar

investments in like circumstances.

1020. As has been discussed in detail above,!?® Claimants have failed to demonstrate that
Mr. Cirielli’s and other individual government members’ statements about the alleged goal of “re-
Argentinizing” the Airlines led to discriminatory treatment that was unfair or inequitable. Further,
Claimants have not demonstrated that any of the government members alleged to have demanded
the re-Argentinization of the Airlines were involved in or had any influence on Respondent’s
decision to expropriate. Claimants have failed to prove that their investment was expropriated

because it was owned by foreigners.

1021. Further, Claimants did not provide evidence of other similar investors in like circumstances
whose investments were not expropriated. The evidence indicates that Claimants’ investment was
expropriated because its continued operation by Respondent would allow Government of

Argentina to fulfil the public interest of connectivity.

1022. As set out above, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s argument that an investment’ s
failure to participate in the local expropriation proceedings affects the admissibility of the claims

under the Treaty.

KF. “Adequate compensation”
1. Positions of the Parties

1023. The Parties do not dispute that Argentina did not pay Claimants when it expropriated the
Airlines in December 2008. Rather, they dispute whether compensation was in fact owed to

Claimants for the Airlines.

1024. Claimants assert that Respondent did not pay Claimants “appropriate compensation,
without undue delay and in freely convertible currency” as required by Article V of the Treaty.
Claimants cite the following facts in support of their assertion that they were owed more than

ARS 1 for the Airlines:

(a) Just before the Government of Argentina started the process of creeping
expropriation (in October 2004) and breaches of fair and equitable treatment (in
September 2002), the Airlines generated net income of USD 47 million (in 2003)
and USD 44 million (in 2004). !7°

(b) An advisor to the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Vazquez, offered to buy the

Airlines in May 2008 for USD 150 million. Claimants rejected this offer, because

they considered it too low.!7°

(c) The valuations of Deloitte, Morgan Stanley, and PricewaterhouseCoopers for

AUSA alone, done as a result of the May 2008 Agreement, averaged USD 450

million.!2%

(d) Claimants further allege that if Respondent had complied with the May 2008
Agreement and its option to purchase 15% of ARSA under the 2006 Agreement, it

would have had to make a capital contribution in ARSA of at least USD 75 million
(which is 15% of USD 450 million, which is the average valuation made by the

three independent valuators under the May 2008 Agreement).!?°°

(e) In October 2008, Credit Suisse valued the Airlines at between USD 330 and
USD 540 million.!?”

1025. Claimants submit that there is ample case law and commentary at international law that the
payment of compensation for an expropriated investment is a necessary element of lawful

expropriation. 27!

In particular, Claimants refer to a number of recent arbitral awards where
expropriations were found to be unlawful because compensation had not been paid, including
Vivendi II, Siemens v. Argentina and Azurix v. Argentina.'?”> Claimants distinguish this case from
others where the expropriating government did not pay the full amount of compensation in a timely

manner and highlight that no compensation at all was paid.!?”7

1026. Moreover, Claimants assert that, in fact, Argentina did attribute a positive value to
Claimants’ expropriated investment, as judged by its behavior. Claimants argue that the facts
demonstrate that the Airlines could not have had a negative value because, in that situation,
Claimants would not have wanted to keep the investment (but they did) and no rational government
would be keen to take it (as Argentina was).!?"* Again, Claimants assert that in April 2008 it
offered (through Mr. Vazquez) USD 150 million for the purchase of the Airlines. They also note
that in November 2008, Respondent valued AUSA at USD 79.9 million, and that in February 2009
it offered Claimants compensation of USD 150 million ‘to solve the problem of the

expropriation.’ !?7>

that this amount was the same as the representative value found to be owing in the expropriation

property had a negative market value. In these circumstances, Respondent says that the appropriate
compensation was zero.'?®° It also notes that Claimants did not challenge the appraisal submitted

appraisal of their own or, alternatively, challenge the valuation of the TTN. !2°!

valuations carried out by the TTN, which are consistent with the restated financial statements as

considered the Airlines to have a positive value.'?** Claimants also note that the TTN valuations
were not done in accordance with the methodology in the July 2008 Agreement and that they were
flawed for the following reasons. They did not consistently apply the DCF method; the TTN
lacked the technical know-how to assess the value of a going concern and, as a result, valued the
Airlines’ assets and liabilities rather than their shares; and the TTN is not an independent third
party, but rather a public agency whose members are all appointed by the Executive. '?*° Claimants
argue that the valuation done by SEPI in 2001 is of little to no use in determining the value of the
Airlines seven years later and that the date of valuation should be the date closest to the date of the

in the domestic court proceedings, Claimants submit that Interinvest sought to suspend the

domestic proceedings which overlapped with this arbitration for good and justified reasons. !?87

for the proposition that the TTN lacks the technical know-how to assess the value of a going

concern company because he is not an expert on valuation techniques. '?**

the State’s decision to expropriate. As conveniently summarized in the World Bank Guidelines

on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment:

1. A State may not expropriate or otherwise take in whole or in part a foreign private
investment in its territory, or take measures which have similar effects, except where this is done in
accordance with applicable legal procedures, in pursuance in good faith of a public purpose, without
discrimination on the basis of nationality and against the payment of appropriate compensation.

2. Compensation for a specific investment taken by the State will, according to the details
provided below, be deemed “appropriate” if it is adequate, effective and prompt.

3. Compensation will be deemed “adequate” if it is based on the fair market value of the taken
asset as such value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred or the
decision to take the asset became publicly known.

 

 

4. Determination of the “fair market value” will be acceptable if conducted according to a
method agreed by the State and the foreign investor (hereinafter referred to as the parties) or by a
tribunal or another body designated by the parties.

5. In the absence of a determination agreed by, or based on the agreement of, the parties, the
fair market value will be acceptable if determined by the State according to reasonable criteria
related to the market value of the investment, i.e., in an amount that a willing buyer would normally
pay to a willing seller after taking into account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in
which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics, including the period in which it
has been in existence, the proportion of tangible assets in the total investment and other relevant
factors pertinent to the specific circumstances of each case. !7°°

1034. Respondent has argued that it paid adequate compensation by providing a representative
ARS 1 for the shares of Interinvest because the investment was loss-making at the time of
expropriation and that, as a result, the shareholders’ equity had a negative valuation. Respondent
has also argued that ARS 1 was adequate compensation, because that was the valuation attributed

to the Airlines by SEPI when it sold the shares of Interinvest to Air Comet in 2001.

1035. The Tribunal notes that the relevant time period for determining whether the compensation
paid for the expropriation of an investment is adequate is immediately before the taking or
immediately before the taking became known. Accordingly, the valuation of the Airlines’ shares
in 2001 is irrelevant to the amount of compensation to be paid for the taking of those shares by

1036. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that there are circumstances in which no
compensation can be adequate compensation for an expropriation. This may be the case when an
investment is loss-making and no longer a going concern. In these circumstances, the State can
demonstrate that the investor did not suffer a financial loss as a result of the taking. In this case,
had the formal expropriation of the Airlines’ shares in December 2008 been the first measure taken
by the Respondent and had the Respondent otherwise treated the investment fairly and equitably,
it is possible that adequate compensation for the shares may have been ARS 1. However, in the
circumstances of this case, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent paid adequate

compensation for the taking of Claimants’ investment.

1037. In this case, there was a lengthy and politically-charged relationship between Claimants,
their investment and Respondent that preceded Respondent’s decision to directly expropriate the
investment. The Tribunal has dismissed many of Claimants’ claims with respect to the measures
that pre-dated the July 2008 Agreement. However, the Tribunal has found that the Parties entered
into that binding agreement, the purpose of which was to provide for Respondent to purchase the

Airlines’ shares at a price to be determined by a particular valuation technique.

1038. In the circumstances of this case, the July 2008 Agreement coincides with the time at which
the decision to take the asset became publicly known. In addition, the July 2008 Agreement
recorded the method agreed by Government of Argentina and the investor to determine the fair
market value of the investment. In the Tribunal’s view, whether either Credit Suisse or the TTN
conducted its respective DCF valuation in accordance with the July 2008 Agreement is irrelevant
for the determination of whether adequate compensation was paid by Respondent. The July 2008
Agreement provided for an independent, third party valuation in the event that the Parties’
respective valuations yielded different results and the Parties could not agree to a value. It was

not open to Respondent to unilaterally change the agreed valuation method.

1039. Had Respondent not breached the July 2008 Agreement and had the DCF analysis
described in that agreement been conducted by a third independent valuator as agreed, the resulting
valuation would have represented adequate compensation for the taking pursuant to the Treaty.

This is because in these circumstances the Parties had agreed to the method for determining the

Award

fair market value of the investment being expropriated. In refusing to complete that valuation and
instead proceeding to a formal expropriation on a different valuation methodology, Respondent

failed to provide adequate compensation for the taking of the investment.

G. Tribunal’s Conclusions on Unlawful Expropriation

1040. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the expropriation of the Airlines was unlawful, as
that taking was not in accordance with the law and Respondent failed to pay adequate

compensation.

XIII. THE DEFENSE OF NECESSITY

1041. In the event that the Tribunal were to find that Respondent breached the Treaty regarding
its measures related to airfare increases, Respondent invokes the defense of necessity.!?°!
Respondent asserts that “the crisis that hit Argentina in late 2001 amounts to a state of necessity
precluding any potential international responsibility in relation to the increase in airfares granted
to the airlines.” It argues that the Argentine Republic was forced to act as it did because it was
the only way to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and it notes that
all of the emergency measures were taken to the benefit of the commercial air sector.!?”
Respondent submits that if the measures were not sufficient, as alleged by Claimants, it is entitled
to rely on the defense of necessity to preclude any wrongfulness or liability under the Treaty with

respect to the sufficiency of the measures granting airfare increases. !?°4

1042. Respondent further argues that the emergency measures it adopted were critical to
overcoming the crisis and regaining economic, social, political and institutional normalcy.
Specifically, Respondent notes that the adoption of Emergency Law No. 25,561 and Presidential
Decrees No. 1654/02 and 1012/06 and the grant of other benefits to Argentine airlines was “the

best that could be done to preserve the air transport public service without affecting other essential

interests of the State, which were also at stake, in a historical context of acute national

emergency.” !?%

1043. For their part, Claimants argue that Argentina’s refusal to grant airfare increases, to which
the Airlines were legally entitled in the period between September 2002 and December 2008 and
especially after 2004 and up to the formal expropriation in 2008, bears no logical or temporal

connection with the 2001 economic crisis. !7°°

1044. Both Parties agree that the standard for Respondent’s necessity defense is Article 25 of the

International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.'?"’ Article 25 provides as

follows:
1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an
act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:
(a) _ is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and
eminent peril; and
(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the
obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.
2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness

if:

(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity;
or

(b) _ the State has contributed to the situation of necessity. !2°*

1045. The Parties each made detailed submissions on the applicability of the defense of necessity

in the circumstances of the instant case and addressed each of the four components of the defense

set out in Article 25 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility. !?”

formed the basis of other tribunals’ findings that Argentina was entitled to rely on the defense of

necessity, the Treaty has no analogous provision and thus the defense is unavailable.

1046. The Tribunal has dismissed Claimants’ claims for breach of FET to the extent that those
claims relate to the sufficiency of the airfare increases granted by Argentina during the period of
Claimants’ ownership of Interinvest. As Respondent only raises the defense of necessity in the
event that the claim relating to the airfare increase was accepted, it is not necessary for the Tribunal
to consider Respondent’s defense of necessity or Claimants’ specific arguments opposing that

defense.

XIV. RESPONDENT’S COUNTERCLAIM

1047. While maintaining its objections to jurisdiction and reserving its rights with respect to
ICSID’s jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims, Respondent submitted a Counterclaim seeking
US $1,636,600,000 in damages for what it says were the losses it suffered because of the poor state
of the Airlines at the time of expropriation.'°°° Claimants submit that the alleged Counterclaim
was vague and unsubstantiated and that it did not meet even the minimum requirements to
constitute a claim to which they could properly respond. As a result, Claimants submit that the

Counterclaim should be dismissed. '3°!

1048. For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ submission that

Respondent’s Cunterclaim should be dismissed.

A. Applicable Law

1049. Respondent submits that the rules applicable to its Counterclaim are Article 46 of the
ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 40. Article 46 of the Convention provides:
Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any
incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the

dispute provided that they are within the scope of consent of the parties and are otherwise within
the jurisdiction of the Centre.

1050. Respondent says that Article 46 of the Convention obliges an ICSID tribunal “to determine
a counter-claim filed by one party provided that it arises directly out of the subject matter of the
dispute, is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of

the Centre.” 3°

1051. While Claimants agree that this article addresses counterclaims, they submit that
Respondent’s damages claim is not a counterclaim, which is required to “be independent of the
principal claim in so far as it constitutes a separate ‘claim’, that is to say an autonomous legal act

the object of which is to submit a new claim[.]”?°

As such, Claimants submit that the
Counterclaim fails to meet the threshold requirement in Article 46. Claimants say that
Respondent’s Counterclaim is more appropriately viewed as a set of arguments related to the

valuation of the expropriated Airlines and a defense against Claimants’ claims. '°°

1052. In its Rejoinder, Respondent indicates that Claimants’ interpretation of the requirement
that counterclaims “aris[e] directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute” is inconsistent with a
requirement that a counterclaim be independent of the principal claim.'*°° Respondent also makes
further submissions as to how its Counterclaim is a separate claim - the claim for damages goes

1306

beyond the value of the expropriated shares. Respondent clarifies that the basis for its

Counterclaim is “article 46 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules and articles
X.1 and X.5 of the BIT, which grant the Tribunal jurisdiction to consider counterclaims ‘in
connection with investments’, in accordance with the BIT, Argentine law and international
law,1307
1053. The Parties agree that Article 46 obliges the Tribunal to “determine any incidental or
additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided

that they are within the scope of consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of

the Centre.” Accordingly, if Respondent establishes that (1) it has a counterclaim, (2) arising
directly out of the subject matter of the dispute that is (3) within the scope of consent of the parties
and otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre, the Tribunal agrees that it is obliged to
determine Respondent’s Counterclaim. However, if Respondent fails to establish any of these

three requirements, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to resolve Respondent’s Counterclaim.

1054. Respondent notes that Arbitration Rule 40 also governs counterclaims and restates the

requirements set forth in Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.'** Rule 40 provides:

(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or
counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary
claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the
Centre.

(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-
claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party
presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the
presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.

(3) The Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is
presented may file its observations thereon.

1055. Respondent takes the position that since its Counterclaim is included in its Counter
Memorial filed in the case, it has fulfilled the temporal requirement contained in Rule 40.!°
Claimants respond that since Respondent has failed to even identify the legal cause of action for
its Counterclaim, there is no claim to which to apply the provisions of the ICSID Convention or
Rules.'?!° Claimants elaborate that by not even identifying the legal cause of action for its claim,

Respondent has failed to present any such claim as required by Rule 40.'3!!

Resp. Rej. {. 839. However, Respondent did not indicate how those legal obligations related to Claimants or
Interinvest, on what basis any such duties would be owed to Respondent or the basis on which causation could be
shown. Even if these later formulations of a potential legal dispute had been elaborated, the Tribunal notes that these
were not presented in time to meet the temporal requirement of Rule 40.

1056. Respondent relies on these provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and
submits that the parties are entitled to present ancillary claims, including counterclaims and that
ICSID tribunals must determine such claims if all applicable conditions are met.'*!? Claimants
say that in addition to having to prove a legal basis for its claim, Respondent must also
substantively prove and support its Counterclaim. Claimants argue that “the gist of the
counterclaim is to total two sums: (i) the Argentine Airlines’ non-operating liabilities as of

December 2008, and (ii) their expected losses from December 2008 onward.” 33

1057. As noted above, the Tribunal agrees that the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules
provide a procedural basis and, in fact, an obligation for the Tribunal to decide Respondent’s
Counterclaim if Respondent’s claim meets the requirements in the applicable provisions.
Respondent does not seem to argue that these provisions provide the legal basis for its
Counterclaims, as it acknowledges that the counterclaim must be based on the substantive law that

applies to the dispute.

1058. Respondent cites the provisions of Article X.5 of the Treaty and submits that the
counterclaim, like the Claimants’ claim, must be decided on the basis of the Treaty and any other
treaties in force between Argentina and Spain; Argentine law, including its norms of private
international law; and the general principles of international law.'*'+ The Tribunal agrees with this
submission as the proper construction of the provisions of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.
Article 46 of the Convention only permits a tribunal to determine counterclaims that “are within
the scope of the consent of the parties.” The consent of the parties arises from the Treaty. Thus,
the determination of whether the claims are within the scope of that consent requires that they arise
from the Treaty and be disputes over which the parties granted their consent to ICSID arbitration.
Respondent relies on the Decision on Jurisdiction as the basis for its argument that its Counterclaim

falls within the scope of the consent of the parties. '*!°

B. Is Respondent’s Counterclaim a Claim?

1059. As noted above, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention applies to “any incidental or additional
claims or counterclaims” and any such counterclaim must substantively be based on the provisions
of the Treaty. The provision relates both to incidental or additional claims and counterclaims.

Thus, the first requirement is that Respondent’s Counterclaim be a counterclaim.

1060. Respondent submits that its Counterclaim “is based on the damage it suffered and which
resulted from Claimants’ administration of the Argentine Airlines and the state of such companies
as a consequence of such administration.”'*!® Claimants submit that this is not a counterclaim
because, in order to be a counterclaim, it must be “an autonomous legal act the object of which is
to submit a new claim to the Court.”!!7 Claimants submit that the counterclaim is really a defense
against Claimants’ compensation claim for expropriation and other Treaty breaches and not a

separate claim.!3!*

1061. In its Counter Memorial, Respondent does not set out a legal basis for its Counterclaim.
Other than the general reference above to Article X.5 and the statement that the counterclaim must
be based on the Treaty, Respondent does not cite any obligations contained in the Treaty (or other
treaties, Argentine law or international law referenced as potential sources of substantive law
contained in the Treaty) that were allegedly breached by Claimants.'*!° Instead, Respondent refers
to the Tribunal’s characterization of Claimants’ claims in the Decision on Jurisdiction as the basis

for its argument that the counterclaim meets the relevant requirements.

1062. Respondent summarizes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as having been asserted “‘on the basis
of a dispute whose purpose would be: i) Respondent’s ‘regulatory treatment’ ‘of Claimants’
investments in the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest,’ and ii) ‘the valuation of Interinvest’s shares

in the Argentine Airlines.’”!*?° Respondent also suggests that “the Tribunal concluded that the

dispute is not limited to claims based on alleged Treaty violations, but also extends to contract
issues and matters of domestic law.”!*?! Leaving aside the accuracy of Respondent’s summary of
the Decision on Jurisdiction, Respondent did not suggest that it had a counterclaim independent of

the claims submitted by Claimants and over which the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction.

1063. Respondent did not present its Counterclaim as a claim that was based on specific
provisions of the Treaty and that would fall within the scope of the jurisdiction as found by the
Tribunal. Respondent instead relies upon its summary of the Decision on Jurisdiction to submit
that because:
...Claimants seek damages allegedly arising out of the treatment_received during their
administration of the Argentine Airlines and Argentina seeks damages arising out of that
administration, the relationship between the claim and counter-claim is direct. They are two sides

of the coin, two claims based on the same facts: the ion of the Argentine
Airlines by the Marsans Group. [Emphasis added]

1064. According to this submission, Respondent’s Counterclaim is based on the treatment
received by Claimants during their administration of the Airlines. While the Treaty imposes
obligations on the States party to the Treaty to accord certain treatment to investments made by
investors, it does not impose reciprocal obligations on investments or investors. Respondent has
not pointed to any right that it has under the Treaty to certain treatment by an investment or an
investor. Similarly, in its Counter Memorial, Respondent pointed to no other right under Argentine

law or general principles of international law on which it based its Counterclaim.

1065. In its submissions regarding whether its Counterclaim was “otherwise within the
jurisdiction of the Centre”, Respondent noted that in order to meet this requirement the

counterclaim must involve “a legal dispute”.!*?? Paragraph 26 of the Report of the Executive

Directors on the Convention addresses this fundamental jurisdictional requirement: '7?3

26. Article 25(1) requires that the dispute must be a “legal dispute arising directly out of an
investment.” The expression “legal dispute” has been used to make clear that while conflicts of
rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not. The dispute must
concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation
to be made for breach of a legal obligation. [Emphasis added]

1066. Thus, in order to come within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for determination,
Respondent’s Counterclaim must meet this threshold; it must concern the existence or scope of a
legal right or obligation (and be a dispute arising directly out of an investment). Again, in its
Counter Memorial, Respondent did not identify any legal right or obligation on which it relied for
its Counterclaim. In its Rejoinder, Respondent focuses again on the relationship of the matters in
the counterclaim to the investment as the basis for jurisdiction ratione materiae,'**4 but does not
address a legal basis for its claim based on the Treaty. At best, Respondent’s Counterclaim is a
defense to Claimants’ claims for the damages arising from Respondent’s alleged breaches of the
Treaty. As concluded by the Hamester tribunal, “in the absence of any submissions on the nature
of the Respondent’s Counterclaim under the BIT, the Tribunal is unable to analyse whether it is
capable, in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, of falling within the parties’ scope of
consent.” 325 Argentina’s Counterclaim suffers the same deficiencies and precludes an analysis of

whether its claims fall within the scope of consent.

Cc. Tribunal’s Conclusion with respect to Respondent’s Counterclaim

1067. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s Counterclaim.

XV. DAMAGES

1068. The Tribunal has found that Respondent is liable for the following breaches of the Treaty:

(a) The obligations of fair and equitable treatment and not to take unjustified or
discriminatory measures, by breaching the July 2008 Agreement and by its non-

transparent and arbitrary behavior following the signing of that agreement; and

(b) Unlawful expropriation for its taking of the Airlines “not in accordance with the

law” and without payment of appropriate compensation.

1069. Of relevance to the damages assessment, Claimants have failed to prove that the facts

related to the Airfare Squeeze amounted to a breach of the Treaty.

1070. Claimants rely upon their valuation experts to quantify their damages claims. They
instructed the experts to provide their opinion on the damages flowing from the following
measures, which Claimants alleged to be unlawful: the Airfare Squeeze and the expropriation of
Claimants’ investment. Claimants alleged breaches of a number of treaty provisions in relation to
the same measures, but the measure of damages claimed does not depend upon the particular
provision of the Treaty alleged to have been breached. Therefore, their approach to damages
related to the particular measures and was independent from the legal theories upon which those
measures were said to be unlawful. However, Claimants submitted that the timing of the
assessment of damages could vary depending on the Tribunal’s findings with respect to the
lawfulness of the expropriation. In support of their damages claims, Claimants submitted evidence
of the alleged historical losses related to the Airfare Squeeze and the value of the Airlines in 2008,

2010 and 2013.

1071. At the hearing and in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants’ request for damages is structured

upon the Tribunal’s finding one of three potential “Scenarios” of liability under the Treaty.

(a) Scenario 1 envisions that this Tribunal would find that Respondent’s formal
expropriation of the Airlines was lawful and that there were no Treaty breaches
prior to the Airlines’ nationalization. In this case, Respondent would owe Claimants
compensation for the lawful expropriation of the Airlines in the middle of 2008.'°7°

Claimants calculate this amount at USD 445 million, based on the “‘as is” value of

AUSA,|??” as of January 1, 2008, before interest as of the date of this Award. !°8

(b) Scenario 2 envisions that this Tribunal would find that Respondent’s formal
expropriation was lawful, but that Respondent breached the Treaty prior to the

expropriation.'*? Specifically, Claimants point to the “airfare squeeze” that

preceded formal expropriation. '**° In this case, Respondent would owe USD 625

million, measured as the as-is value of AUSA plus damages from the airfare

squeeze in the amount of USD 268 million, before interest as of the date of the

Award, !33!

(c) Scenario 3 envisions that this Tribunal would find that Respondent’s formal
expropriation was unlawful, and that Respondent also breached the Treaty prior to
the expropriation. Under this scenario, the Tribunal would value the Airlines as of

1332

today, as if Claimants continued to operate them. The calculation for this

Scenario 3 is USD 1.3357 billion for AUSA and USD 254.3 million for ARSA, for
a total of USD 1.59 billion calculated with interest through July 31, 2013.!77

1072. Respondent took issue with Claimants’ Scenarios arguing that they were new valuation

methods that were not supported by Claimants’ experts. !?**4

1073. In response to this particular criticism, Claimants submit that there is no requirement at
international law that it present a litigation valuation by a party-retained expert. Claimants submit
that “true third-party contemporaneous non-litigation valuations, as exist here, are widely
considered to be the best and most reliable indicators of value.” !3°5

1074. In light of the fact that none of the various scenarios presented by Claimants precisely
reflects the Tribunal’s liability findings, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to review in
detail all three scenarios presented. The Tribunal notes that Scenario | is the most suitable starting
point, as it proposes valuations not based on the Airfare Squeeze. The specifics of the 2008

valuations and the criticisms of those valuations by Respondent will be discussed further below in

the context of the evidence on damages. The Tribunal’s damages analysis will look first to the
legal basis for damages and then turn to the evidence submitted by Claimants to support those

damages claims.

A. Applicable Law

1075. Claimants submit that the remedy for unlawful expropriation is not found in the Treaty;
instead it is found in customary international law and is usually referred to as “damages” or
“reparation”. '*°° Claimants argue that when a State lawfully expropriates an investor’s property,
it must pay compensation, usually described as appropriate or adequate compensation payable
without undue delay as provided by the Treaty. However, Claimants submit that when an
investment is unlawfully expropriated, customary international law principles apply to the amount
of compensation to be paid. Claimants say that customary international law requires the State to
pay damages that restore the investor to the position that it would have been in but for the unlawful
acts. Claimants submit that these damages include either restitution in kind or its monetary
equivalent and any additional loss that flows from the breach that has been proven to have been

suffered by the investor.

1076. Claimants rely on the oft-cited articulation of reparation as a principle of customary

international law found in the Chorzéw Factory case:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to
be established by international practice and in particular by decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that
reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all of the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.

 

It follows that the compensation due to the German Government is not necessarily limited to the
value of the undertaking at the moment of dis on, plus interest to the day of payment. This
limitation would only be admissible if the Polish Government had had the right to expropriate.

 

Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a
restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not
be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it.!°°7

1077. Claimants also rely upon the 2001 Draft Articles on State Responsibility of the
International Law Commission (“ILC Articles”), which address the elements of internationally
wrongful acts of States, attribution and the legal consequences of those acts. Article 31 contains

the general principle that a State must make reparation:

Article 31

Reparation
1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused
by the internationally wrongful act.
2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally

wrongful act of a State.
1078. Chapter II of the ILC Articles deal with reparation for injury and Claimants have
specifically invoked Articles 35 and 36 in support of their claim for damages. The Tribunal

considers it useful to set out here the text of Articles 34 through 36:

Chapter IT
Reparation for Injury
Article 34
Forms of reparation
Full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of
restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
Article 35
Restitution
A State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution,
that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided
and to the extent that restitution:
(a) is not materially impossible;

(b) does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution
instead of compensation.

able damage including loss of profits

 

1079. Respondent submits that the compensation standard for lawful expropriation and unlawful
expropriation (if unlawful for failure to pay compensation) is the same and is the one provided for
by the Treaty.'**8 With respect to compensation for other Treaty breaches or expropriation that is
unlawful for reasons unrelated to compensation, Respondent agrees that the principles of
customary international law apply but disputes that those principles arise from either the Chorzéw
Factory case or the ILC Articles.'*° Respondent submits that customary international law
“requires evidence of a general practice of the States with opinio iuris.”'*° Respondent says that
neither the Chorzéw decision nor the Draft Articles on State Responsibility are sources of

international law per se.'*4!

1080. Respondent argues that international customary law as it relates to compensation for
expropriation is reflected in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, approved by the

General Assembly of the United Nations with 120 votes in favor.'*4? Article II(2)(c) provides:

Each State has the right [t]o nationalize, expropriate or transfer ownership of foreign property, in
which case appropriate compensation should be paid by the State adopting such measures, taking
into account its relevant laws and regulations and all circumstances that the State considers pertinent.

1081. Based on this, Respondent submits that the applicable principle evidenced by the practice

of States accepted as law is that of “appropriate” or “fair” compensation. !*47

1082. Further, Respondent states that the ILC Articles are not prima facie applicable per se to
any compensation for damage sustained by a person or entity other than a State.'!*+ Respondent
relies on the ILC’s Report commentary to Article 28, which states that “[Part Two] does not apply
to obligations of reparation to the extent that these arise towards or are invoked by a person or
entity other than a State.” Respondent accepts that “certain general principles of international
customary law may be derived from the [ILC Articles]” but submits that they are not fully

applicable to this case. !*45

1083. Respondent notes that the ILC considered the significance of proportionality of
compensation in relation to damage caused, which Respondent says impacts the principle of full
reparation allegedly arising from or as articulated in the Chorzéw case. Respondent cites the ILC’s

Report as it relates to Article 34 of the ILC Articles:

Concerns have sometimes been expressed that the principle of full reparation may lead to
disproportionate and even crippling requirements so far as the responsible State is concerned. The
issue is whether the principle of proportionality should be articulated as an aspect of the obligation
to make full reparation. In these articles, proportionality is addressed in the context of each form of
reparation, taking into account its specific character. Thus restitution is excluded if it would involve
a burden out of all proportion to the benefit gained by the injured State or other party. Compensation
is limited to damage actually suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act, and excludes
damage which is indirect or remote. Satisfaction must “not be out of proportion to the injury”.
Thus, each of the forms of reparation takes such considerations into account. '*“

  

1084. Respondent submits that the general principles that must govern the quantification of
damages in this case are the specific content of the primary obligations allegedly breached, the
behavior of both parties, and the achievement of an equitable outcome.'*4” Respondent says that
the relevant criteria for fair compensation set forth by the general principles of international law
are the following:
. There must be a close causal link between the damage sustained by the Claimant and the
violation of international law;

. Compensation must be reasonable;

[Footnotes with citations omitted]

1085. Respondent notes that these general principles of international law are substantially in
accordance with Argentine law and thus, according to both, “the existence of an obligation to
compensate on the part of the Argentine State is subject to the satisfaction of a number of

requirements.” !*4

1086. In their Reply, Claimants state that the damages concepts as articulated by Respondent
“(other than the last two)” are uncontroversial and that Claimants have no fundamental
disagreement with any of them. Claimants submit that their damages claim is consistent with these
principles.'*°° Claimants maintain that the standard of compensation in international law for
unlawful expropriation is “full reparation” measured as the higher of the value of the expropriated
asset on the date of the taking or date of the award.'*>! Claimants say that this theory is sound
because it may be necessary to account for post-expropriation events that would have accrued to a
claimant’s benefit in absence of the unlawful taking. '°? Further, Claimants submit that “current
value is necessary as an alternative to restitution, since if the State refuses to restore the
expropriated asset in response to an arbitral award to that effect, the investor should receive the

asset’s value as of the date of the State’s refusal.” !55

(i) Claimants’ claim satisfies the requirement of causation, (ii) the duty to mitigate is not implicated
here, and (iii) Claimants’ damages claim is reasonable as it [is] comprehensively evidenced in CL’s
reports, as well as supported by the third-party valuations that did not even take account of the 2002-
2008 airfare squeeze yet still concluded that the airlines were worth on average of US$445 million
shortly before the expropriation. 3+

1088. The Tribunal notes that the Parties are in substantial agreement regarding the principles
applicable to damages in international law with one significant exception. Respondent takes the
position that compensation for expropriation, whether lawful or unlawful because of a failure to
pay adequate compensation at the time of taking, is governed by the appropriate compensation
standard in the Treaty. With respect to all other breaches, Respondent seems to argue that fair
compensation must be paid with regard to a number of criteria, but denies that there is a general
principle of customary international law to provide full reparation in these circumstances.
Respondent does not seem to dispute that the ILC Articles in general codify principles of
international law, including the obligation for a State to make full reparation in the event of a
breach of an international obligation. Instead, Respondent submits that that because of the scope
of the ILC Articles, the obligation to make reparation is only owed to other States. Respondent
also takes the position that the Chorzéw Factory case cannot be used on its own as a source of

customary international law, as customary international law requires opinio iuris.

1089. The Tribunal does not accept these technical objections. The Chorzéw Factory case is not
the source of the customary international law principle of full reparation, but the tribunal in that
case determined that that principle was one that had been established by international practice.
The adoption of the ILC Articles, which clearly articulate a State’s obligation to provide full
reparation in the event of a breach of an international obligation, and the practice of States in
paying reparations in these circumstances, suggest that States accept this obligation. This is not to
say that the general principle of international law that a State that has been found to have breached
an international obligation must make full reparation for any damages caused by its breach has any
impact on a State’s right to expropriate a foreigner’s property at international law. A State’s right
to do so exists at international law and, so long as the property is lawfully expropriated, there is an

obligation to compensate the owner, but not to make full reparation. The State’s obligation to

make full reparation is related to its breach of international law. Respondent’s concerns about the
obligation to make full reparation leading to disproportionate compensation are dealt with in the
limiting factors that the Parties agree are principles relating to damages in international law. With
respect to compensation, the ILC noted that “[c]ompensation is limited to damage actually suffered
as a result of the internationally wrongful act, and excludes damage which is indirect or remote.”
This is consistent with Respondent’s submissions on the “requirements” before damages can be

awarded, as set out above.

1090. The Tribunal notes that the principle of full reparation has been consistently applied by
tribunals. For example, the Vivendi IT tribunal concluded:

...it is generally accepted today that, regardless of the type of investment, and regardless of the

nature of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages awarded in international investment

arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to compensate the affected party fully and to eliminate the
consequences of the state’s action.

1091. The Annulment Committee in Azurix stated this in slightly different terms:

It is not in dispute between the parties, nor in the Committee’s view could it seriously be disputed,
that the Tribunal had the power in this case to award damages for any loss that the Tribunal found
to have been suffered by Azurix as a result of breaches of the BIT for which Argentina was
responsible. 1355

1092. Accordingly, international law requires Respondent to make reparation to Claimants for
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty and the Tribunal’s award of damages should seek to put
Claimants in the position they would have been in but for Respondent’s breaches. As with any
claim, it is for Claimants to prove that the damages suffered were caused by Respondent’s breaches

and the quantum of those damages.

B. Restitution in Kind

1093. At the hearing and in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants indicated that their preferred
remedy was the “restitution of their corporate rights in the Argentine Airlines (through

Interinvest)”. Claimants said that Respondent did not question their right to restitution and that,

Award

as a result, the Tribunal should award it as the primary form of relief. In addition, Claimants
suggest that the Tribunal’s award should also include compensation as an alternative, since an
award of restitution is not easily enforceable in the event Respondent refuses to comply with the
Tribunal’s award. !9°6

1094. Although Claimants’ request for relief in their Memorial includes a request for an award
of “restitution or the monetary equivalent of all damages caused”,!**’ the Tribunal notes that
Claimants initially indicated that they were not seeking the return of their corporate rights in this

arbitration:

Argentina must, therefore, “re-establish the situation which existed” before the wrongful act, that
is, before the expropriation, was Since Claimants are not i ion in kind
of their investment, Argentina must pay the monetary equivalent, that is, in the words of the
Chorzé6w Factory case, a sum which would “wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed.” In addition, Argentina must pay “damages for loss sustained which would not be
covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it.[Emphasis added]'*°*

 

1095. Unsurprisingly, Respondent’s Counter-Memorial does not specifically address Claimants’
request for restitution in kind. Respondent does, in the context of its submissions on the
requirement of proportionality of compensation in relation to the damage caused, refer to the
principle that restitution is excluded “if it would involve a burden out of all proportion to the

benefit gained by the injured State or other party.”!?°°

1096. In their Reply, for the first time Claimants make clear that they “seek first and foremost
restitution of the corporate rights attached to their shares in the expropriated Argentine Airlines,
plus all historical and consequential damages, including interest up to the effective payment of the
award.”!3 Claimants argue that although they still hold legal title to their shares in the Airlines,
Respondent confiscated their legal corporate rights attached to those shares. Claimants allege that

“Argentina has not challenged Claimants’ right to restitution of their investment.” °°!

Award

1097. In light of the confusion created by the way restitution in kind is addressed in Claimants’
Memorial, the Tribunal is of the view that it was not a fair characterization of Argentina’s position
in the Claimants’ Reply to say that it had not challenged Claimants’ right to restitution. In any
event, Claimants did not address Argentina’s general argument that the damages awarded,
including the possibility of restitution, must be proportionate to the benefit gained by Respondent.
In the Tribunal’s view, if Claimants were serious that restitution of their corporate rights was their
primary claim for damages, then they were under an obligation to establish that right in the
circumstances of this case and demonstrate that such an award was reasonable and
proportionate. '*°? The Tribunal notes that through the July 2008 Agreement Claimants agreed to
sell their shares in the Airlines to Respondent, thereby exiting the market. This indicates

Claimants’ acknowledgment that damages are a sufficient remedy.

1098. Further and in any event, the Tribunal is of the view that, in the circumstances of this case,
restitution in kind is neither practical nor practicable. Claimants are in bankruptcy and the Airlines
have now been operated by Respondent for a number of years. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses
Claimants’ request for restitution in kind and turns now to the assessment of their alternative claim

for the monetary equivalent of all damages caused to its investments.

Cc. Assessment of Damages

1099. Claimants argued that Respondent’s measures, the Airfare Squeeze and expropriation of
their investment, were breaches of the Treaty and caused them damages. The Tribunal has rejected
Claimants’ contention that the Airfare Squeeze rose to the level of a Treaty breach. The Tribunal
has found a breach of the FET standard related to Respondent’s measures following the July 2008
Agreement and its subsequent breach of that agreement. The Tribunal has also found that

Respondent’s expropriation of the Airlines was unlawful.

 

1362 The Tribunal notes that Claimants’ submi:

 

ns did not set out a different damages scenario based on the return
of the shares to Interinvest, as opposed to the appropriate compensation for the expropriation of those shares. In this
case, it would be inconsistent with restitution in kind to award both appropriate compensation for the shares and the
return of those shares to Interinvest.

1100. The Tribunal finds that while there were multiple breaches of the Treaty, there was only
one set of consequences flowing from those breaches. The Tribunal found that the July 2008
Agreement was a binding agreement in which Respondent agreed to purchase the shares of
Interinvest based on an agreed valuation methodology with certain agreed parameters. As has
been discussed in detail in earlier sections of this Award, Respondent, after executing the July
2008 Agreement, comported itself in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner and, eventually,
refused to carry out the valuation process set out in that agreement. Instead of purchasing the
shares as agreed, Respondent unlawfully expropriated those shares and the ownership rights that
attached to them. Accordingly, Respondent’s Treaty breaches deprived Claimants of the payment
for their shares of Interinvest as determined by the agreed valuation methodology in the July 2008
Agreement. This is the consequence of Respondent’s breach of the FET standard. It is also the

consequence of Respondent’s unlawful expropriation of Claimants’ investment.

1101. As has been noted above, Claimants provided a simplified summary of their damages
submissions based on various possible liability findings. They referred to these as Scenarios 1, 2
and 3.'%° Claimants explained their rationale for presenting multiple damages scenarios: “we
wanted to draw the Tribunal’s attention to how it could reasonably quantify damages based on the
existing record regardless of its ultimate determinations on liability.”!*° Claimants indicated that
they wished to avoid a further, separate quantum phase after a full hearing on liability, merits and

1365

quantum had already been conclude In this context, Claimants provided references to

evidence in the record of the value of the Airlines in 2008.

1102. Scenario 1 was described by Claimants to be the minimum compensation payable by

Respondent, representing what they submitted was “fair market value of their investment in the

Argentine Airlines in their ‘as is’ condition as of the date of nationalization in 2008.”!7%

Claimants rely on the third-party valuations prepared by the accounting firms and investment

banks in 2008. Claimants note that these valuations were performed by Deloitte, Morgan Stanley

that amounted to a breach of the Treaty. Since this has not been proved, these scenarios will not be discussed further.

averaged USD 415 million and for ARSA the average was USD 30 million. Claimants also

referred to the valuation prepared by Credit Suisse in the context of the July 2008 Agreement.

1103. At the hearing, Respondent objected to the third-party valuations on the basis that they
were not submitted during the merits phase of the case and that Scenario 1 was never valued by
Claimants’ experts.'**7 Respondent argued that Claimants had never submitted an expert valuation

of the Airlines as of 2008 and that this was a “fatal flaw” for Claimants’ case. !3°*

1104. Claimants respond that from the first page of their Memorial on the Merits, they maintained
the position that these valuations “were a reliable indicator of the minimum level of compensation
owed.” 36 Further, as noted above, Claimants submit that there is no requirement at international
law that it present a litigation valuation by a party-retained expert. Claimants submit that “true
third-party contemporaneous non-litigation valuations, as exist here, are widely considered to be

the best and most reliable indicators of value.”!3”°

Compass Lexecon’s calculation confirms the reliability of the other third-party valuations
performed in 2008. Claimants submit that there was a convergence in these valuations, which

supports their reliability as evidence of the Airlines’ value in 2008.

1106. The Tribunal is of the view that the third-party valuations of the Airlines in the record are
evidence of the Airlines’ value in 2008. There is no requirement for a claimant to submit an expert
valuation prepared for the arbitration in order to found its claim for damages. While expert
evidence is often used to support a damages analysis, this is not necessarily a requirement if other
reliable evidence exists to support quantification of damages. This case is unusual in that there
are a number of contemporaneous valuations in the record. While those valuations were not
prepared for the purpose of the arbitration, the Tribunal does not consider that a factor that makes
them less reliable indicators of value. In fact, the fact that they were prepared to support arm’s
length negotiations for the sale of the Airlines makes them sound indicators of the fair market
value in 2008. However, because they were not prepared for the arbitration, the third party
valuations may not perfectly address the specific damages to be awarded. The Tribunal must be
cautious to consider the basis on which the valuations were performed in order to determine their

relevance to the damages being claimed in this case in light of the Tribunal’s liability findings.

1107. The Tribunal notes that the third-party valuations prepared in relation to the May 2008
Agreement were all DCF valuations based on the Airlines’ projections as of early 2008. The
May 2008 Agreement contemplated the share price being established by the average of three
valuations, but that deal did not complete. The evidence indicates that the financial status of the
Airlines worsened between May and July 2008. Accordingly, these third-party valuations are not
of direct value in determining Claimants’ damages. They do, however, provide support for the

general range in values for the Airlines in the period preceding the July 2008 Agreement.

1108. The Tribunal has found that Respondent’s complaints about lack of access to financial
information about the Airlines or the true state of the extent of the Airlines’ financial difficulties

when they entered into the July 2008 Agreement were unfounded.'*° The July 2008 Agreement

was negotiated with the express intent of keeping the Airlines in operation in order to maintain
Respondent’s public interest in connectivity. Respondent was purchasing two operating airlines
with the intention of continuing to operate them. At the time, with knowledge of the financial
circumstances, the Parties - negotiating at arm’s length - agreed that the purchase price would be

determined using a DCF valuation.

1109. As the Tribunal has noted, although Claimants have proved multiple breaches of the Treaty,
the damages flowing from those breaches are all related. But for the breach of FET, Claimants
would have transferred their shares to Respondent at a price arrived at pursuant to an agreed
methodology. But for the unlawful expropriation, Claimants would have been paid fair market
value for their investment in 2008. As the Tribunal will discuss further below, it considers the best
evidence of fair market value to be the price for the shares to be determined by the pricing

mechanism agreed by Interinvest and Respondent in July 2008.

1110. The DCF methodology and parameters agreed in the July 2008 Agreement were a
negotiated compromise. In this way, the Credit Suisse valuation (performed pursuant to the July
2008 Agreement) differed from the other third-party valuations prepared in the context of the
May 2008 Agreement, which did not have similar negotiated constraints on the cash flow
estimates. Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement provided (in relevant part):

The valuation shall be performed using the discounted cash flow method. Such future cash flows.

shall be calculated using the following assumptions: (i) the cost of fuel at its current subsidized value

of $1.85 (one Argentine peso and eighty-five cents) per liter plus VAT; said price is to be changed

using reference prices and proportionately to price variations in the market; and (ii) the current fare
for domestic flights, modified proportionately to any changes projected for all other costs.

1111. Thus, the Parties agreed to limit both the extent of the costs (through the subsidized fuel
price with market increases) and the projected revenues (by using current fares increased
proportionately by projected costs). This was the best valuation that Claimants were able to
negotiate in the then financial circumstances of the Airlines, which were known to Respondent.
In the Tribunal’s view, the result of this valuation is the best approximation of fair market value

of the Airlines in July 2008.

1112. As discussed in detail at paragraphs 813 through 829, Credit Suisse prepared its valuation
pursuant to the July 2008 Agreement and returned a value of between USD 0 to USD 60 million
for ARSA and USD 330 million to USD 480 million for AUSA.'37” Respondent made a number
of formalistic objections to the Credit Suisse valuation, which the Tribunal has rejected.!*7* The
evidence indicates that the TTN was able to assess the Credit Suisse valuation and that the
controversies at the time did not focus on the substance of the valuation.'*”” The TTN clearly
disagreed with the use of a DCF methodology for the valuation of the Airlines. '*°° However, that
was the methodology agreed by the Parties. The Tribunal has found that the DCF analysis that
was performed by the TTN did not breach the July 2008 Agreement. Nevertheless, a number of
issues related to the substance and methodology of the TTN’s DCF valuation were raised at the
time and appear to be valid criticisms. '**! In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers the Credit
Suisse valuation to be the most reliable expression of the value of the Airlines as agreed by the
Parties under the July 2008 Agreement and the best evidence of the fair market value of the

Airlines in late 2008.

1113. In addition, Claimants’ experts adjusted their model in order to provide a proxy for the
value of AUSA in 2008 assuming no breaches of the Treaty and determined that value to be USD
357 million.'*** This provides the Tribunal with a check on the reasonableness of the Credit Suisse
valuation. The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s criticism that this calculation did not
represent a value as of 2008 because the experts discounted from the 2010 valuation to arrive at
the figure. The valuation date does not change the underlying cash flows (Compass Lexecon added
in the cash flows for 2009 and 2010). Thus, the difference between the value at the two different
dates is a simple mathematical exercise to account for the time value of money (discounting by the

WACC). The Tribunal notes that this valuation proxy was provided to value AUSA as of January

1377-201, p.7.

1378 Soe Gi] 823 - 825.

1379 See {| 826 - 828 and the sources cited there.

1389 The TTN’s valuations were based on the liquidation value approach. Compass Lexecon explains that this approach
is also inappropriate from an economic perspective, as it attributes no value to the intangible assets of the Airlines, it
only values assets owned by the Airlines and most of the assets were leased, and it fails to value any synergies between
the assets, which is inappropriate for a business that operates 's in a network rather than as individual assets.

2008 and that the value of the Airlines deteriorated during 2008. Also, this proxy was provided
for AUSA only, as the negative cash flows for ARSA in 2009 and 2010 did not permit a similar
exercise for ARSA.

1114. Accordingly, Claimants have proved that the fair market value of the Airlines in 2008 was
at least USD 330 million (USD 0 for ARSA and USD 330 million for AUSA) and that they
suffered damages of at least USD 320,760,000, which corresponds to their 97.2 percent
shareholding in AUSA.'*** In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has considered Respondent’ s
position that the two Airlines must be valued together because the claim in the arbitration was
brought with respect to Claimants’ share in Interinvest as the holding company that controlled both
Airlines.'**+ Since the Tribunal has accepted the Credit Suisse valuation performed on the basis
of the agreed DCF methodology in the July 2008 Agreement as the basis for Claimants’ damages
and that valuation did not return a negative valuation for either ARSA or AUSA, Respondent’s
argument in this respect is irrelevant. Further and in any event, the July 2008 Agreement clearly

provided for separate valuations of the shares of AUSA and ARSA.

1115. Claimants argued that in an unlawful expropriation scenario, they were entitled to the
greater of the fair market value at the time of the taking and the fair market value at the date of the
Award. While the Tribunal agrees that this may be an appropriate determination of reparation
when a State expropriates an obviously profitable asset, it is not appropriate in these circumstances.
The Airlines were in financial difficulty and the record indicated that significant cash investments
were required to allow them to continue to operate. Even if it were appropriate to award Claimants
a value that reflected a restructured and refinanced asset, the Tribunal is not persuaded that
Claimants have adequately proved a higher value for the shares of the Airlines than the USD 330

million, which reflects the minimum value calculated in the Credit Suisse valuation.

383 Claimants acquired a 97.4% participation in ARSA and 96.6% participation in AUSA in 2001. After Claimants
increased their participation in Interinvest, they had a 98.0% share in ARSA and 97.2% share in AUSA. As a result
of the June 2006 Agreement, Claimants transferred a 3.8% stake in ARSA to Respondent leaving them with 94.2%
participation in ARSA. See LECG ERI 21.

1116. In summary, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have proved damages in the amount of USD
320,760,000 for their shareholding in AUSA and ARSA flowing from Respondent’s breaches of
the Treaty.

D. Interest

1117. Claimants have requested the payment of pre-award and post-award compound interest
until the effective date of payment.'**° In their Memorial, Claimants requested the payment of
post-award interest at an “appropriate rate of interest, compounded at least semi-annually.”

According to Claimants, the award of compound interest is becoming widely accepted as an

appropriate and necessary component of compensation for expropriation. '°°

1118. Claimants request that if the Tribunal chooses a historical date of valuation, such as 2008,
that it calculate the value of pre-award interest as of the date of the award.'*8’ With respect to the
applicable rate of interest, Claimants submit that the Tribunal should award interest at either
LIBOR plus 2% or “the 8.75% rate that Argentina used in its recent settlement with Repsol”.!*8

In their Reply submission, Claimants submitted that the post-award rate should be at the weighted

average cost of capital (WACC) rate, compounded quarterly, until the date of payment. '3*

1119. Respondent takes the position that any interest awarded should be at a risk-free rate, which
it says is the usual practice in international arbitration. It also says that compound interest is
exceptional.'*°? With respect to the appropriate risk-free rate, Respondent points to a number of

awards in which the tribunals awarded interest at a risk-free rate using the US six-month Treasury

Bill rate or the rate for US six-month Certificates of Deposit.'*?!

Award

 

1120. The Tribunal notes that the ILC Articles also address interest as a component of a State’s

obligation to make full reparation. Article 38 provides:

Interest
1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in
order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve

that result.

2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the
obligation to pay is fulfilled.

1121. The Tribunal has no hesitation in accepting that the payment of interest forms part of the
obligation to make full reparation for a breach of an international obligation. This appears to be
common ground between the Parties. Accordingly, as the Tribunal has found breaches by
Respondent of its obligations under the Treaty, it is appropriate to award interest. The relevant
questions are the appropriate rate of interest, whether interest should be simple or compound and

the date from which interest should run.

1122. Claimants have proposed two alternative rates of interest: (i) LIBOR plus 2% or (ii) the
rate of 8.75% which they say is the rate Respondent agreed to use in a recent settlement. However,
Claimants have not supported these rates of interest in any way nor demonstrated how they relate
to the harm suffered by the delay in payment to them of the sums awarded. In this case, unlike in
Siag, the Treaty does not provide any guidance on the rate of interest applicable to compensation

due under the Treaty. !*9*

1123. On the other hand, Respondent submits that any interest payable should be at a risk-free
rate and it points to a number of awards in which such a rate was awarded and, in particular, the

rate for 6-month US Treasury Bills.!°°

1124. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it should award either of the
higher rates proposed by Claimants. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the appropriate interest

rate is the US six-month Treasury Bill rate.

1392 ©_342: Siag v. Egypt | 597 where the tribunal notes that Article V of the Italy-Egypt BIT at issue in that case
provided that compensation for expropriation should include interest at the current six-month LIBOR rate of interest.

v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1)
Award

 

1125. With respect to whether interest should be awarded on a simple or a compound basis, the
Tribunal is persuaded that the latter is appropriate. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the
tribunal in the Siag award that compound interest has been awarded more often than not and is
becoming widely accepted as an appropriate and necessary component of compensation. In the
Tribunal’s view, compound interest will better compensate for actual damages suffered since it is
consistent with contemporary financial practice and would have been available had the amount
awarded been paid in a timely manner.!*** In the Tribunal’s view, compounding on a semi-annual

basis would be appropriate.

1126. With respect to the date from which interest should commence, the Tribunal finds that
December 30, 2008 is the appropriate date. This is the date on which the Argentine Congress
adopted Decree 2347/2008 by which Respondent declared that all the rights granted by the shares
of the Airlines were to be exercised by the administrative entity appointed by the Government until
the expropriation process had been completed. While various aspects of Respondent’s breach of
the FET standard occurred somewhat earlier than this date, the Tribunal finds this an appropriate

and practical point from which to calculate interest.

1127. Accordingly, the Tribunal grants interest at the US six-month Treasury Bill rate
compounded semi-annually on the principal sum awarded as of December 30, 2008 until payment

in full.

1128. With respect to the amount awarded for costs in the next section, the Tribunal believes that
interest on the amount awarded should be at the same six-month US Treasury Bill rate as of the
date of this Award. The Tribunal fixes this date on the basis that it is not in a position to determine

the dates on which the various costs were incurred by Claimants.

1129. Finally, Claimants requested that the Tribunal calculate the value of pre-award interest.
Given the variable nature of the interest rate awarded over the relevant period, the Tribunal

declines this request.

XVI. COSTS OF THE PROCEEDING

1130. Claimants and Respondent each requested an award of costs against the other. !*°>

1131. Claimants submitted that they should be granted an award of all their costs and expenses,
including legal and experts’ fees on the basis of the principle of “loser pays” or that costs follow
the event. They also submitted that Respondent’s conduct justified such an award. In this regard,
Claimants pointed to Respondent’s reluctance or failure to provide access to certain documentation
as one example of that conduct. Claimants also say that Respondent’s conduct increased their

costs and this also supports their payment by Respondent.'?°

1132. In addition, Claimants submitted that the unlawful expropriation of their investment was
at the core of this case and that through one of its witnesses Respondent had acknowledged that it
owed Claimants at least USD 150 million for that expropriation. As a result, Claimants were
forced to incur significant costs and to wait a number of years to be compensated. They say that
if they are not compensated for these costs, they would not be made whole as required by

international law.'°°”

1133. In their First Statement Quantifying Costs, Claimants set out a breakdown of legal fees and
expenses and experts’ fees and expenses as well as other related expenses including translation
and reporting fees and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal. The total amount claimed was
USD 16,115,716.06. Claimants submitted that the fees and expenses claimed were necessary for
the proper conduct of the case and are reasonable and appropriate given the complex circumstances

of the case and the amount in controversy.

1134. In their Second Statement on Costs, Claimants updated their previous claim, again

providing a breakdown. Claimants’ updated claim for costs was as follows:

  

1395 The Parties’ requests for costs were set out in their pleadings in general terms and further specified in their post-
hearing briefs. Pursuant to the Tribunal’s instruction, the Parties made additional submissions in which they quantified
their claims for costs. These were made by way of initial statements on July 7, 2014 and updated statements on
December 16, 2016.

1135. In its request for costs, Respondent reviewed the various practices regarding the allocation
of costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, including a pro rata allocation according to
the outcome of the dispute and that each party bears its own costs. Respondent also submitted that
the conduct of the parties during the proceedings, as well as the circumstances of the case as a

whole, are significant and should be taken into account.

1136. Respondent submitted that on the basis of Claimants’ conduct, the Tribunal should order
Claimants to pay all costs, including the fees and expenses incurred by it as well as the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and other charges. Respondent says this is appropriate since Claimants’
resort to arbitration was abusive when, in the local expropriation proceedings which were lawful,
Claimants adopted a passive stance. Further, Respondent says that Claimants adopted an

obstructive approach and concealed information. '7°”

1137. In its First Statement on Costs, Respondent provided a breakdown of its costs which

totalled USD 2,243,572.44. Those costs were broken down as follows:

1138. In its Second Statement on Costs, Respondent updated this figure to include additional

costs and expenses which were set out as follows:

 

1139. It was common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal is required to assess the
expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with the arbitration and decide how and by whom

of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. In addition, Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules

appears not to have included other legal fees since it was represented by members of the Treasury Attorney General’s

provides how the Tribunal may fix and allocate costs. Each of the Parties based their arguments

on the exercise of the Tribunal’s discretion.

1140. In regard to the allocation of costs, having carefully considered the various pleadings and
applications, including Claimants’ various applications for interim measures, during the course of
these lengthy and complex proceedings, the Tribunal has determined that the appropriate basis on
which to allocate costs is the pro rata or proportional approach since Claimants were, ultimately,

successful in respect of a substantial part of their claim.

1141. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has considered the degree of success of each of
the Parties in the various interim measures and other applications made during the course of the
arbitration. In this regard, Claimants achieved mixed success. On the other hand, Claimants were

successful in defending against Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and its Counterclaim.

1142. The Tribunal has also considered the Parties’ respective submissions regarding the conduct
of the other during the course of the arbitration. In that regard, the Tribunal is not persuaded that
either Party’s conduct was such as to justify a special allocation of costs or departure from the

proportional approach adopted.

1143. In their claim, Claimants claimed restitution or the monetary equivalent of all damages
caused to their investments, including historical and consequential damages. The Tribunal has
found that restitution is not practical and has awarded approximately 20% of Claimants’ claim of
USD 1.59 billion under its scenario 3. The Tribunal believes that it would be appropriate to
allocate to Claimants their costs in approximately the same proportion. Accordingly, the Tribunal

determines that Claimants are entitled to payment of 20% of their costs claimed.

1144. Turning to the quantum of the costs claimed, the Tribunal notes that the Parties did not
raise any objections to the amounts claimed by the other. The Tribunal recognizes that Claimants’
costs are substantially higher than those of Respondent, primarily due to the difference in the legal
fees and expenses of external counsel. In this regard, Respondent was represented by the Treasury
Attorney General’s department, in respect of which Respondent have not made any claim for legal

fees.

1145. In respect of the legal costs sought by Claimants, the Tribunal is satisfied that the amount
claimed for legal fees and expenses is in line with the level of fees charged by a major international
law firm in a case of this size and complexity. As a result, the Tribunal concludes the legal fees

and expenses claimed by Claimants are reasonable.

1146. Accordingly, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal
concludes that it would be appropriate, in the exercise of its discretion, to order Respondent to pay
to Claimants the sum of USD 3,494,807 as a reasonable contribution towards their costs and
expenses. To this amount is added interest at the rate determined above at paragraph 1128

commencing as of the date of this award.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1)

DISSENTING OPINION OF KAMAL HOSSAIN

1. I regret that I am compelled to give a separate dissenting opinion. In my respectful
submission my main disagreement with my colleagues centres around setting out of
contentious factual positions regarding the identity of the Claimants and their investment
in Argentina. These issues have remains unresolved from the Decision on Jurisdiction
(when I provided a Separate Opinion) and were to be dealt with in the Award on the
Merits. The Award does not deal with or settle those outstanding issues. My objections
related to the preliminary, but fundamental, unresolved issues which were to be dealt
with in the Award on the merits upon consideration of the evidence on record, such as the
identity of the Claimants which is dealt with, but not resolved in the Award, in turn

giving rise to other abnormalities.

2. To determine the identity of the Claimants, the following simple, but crucial, issues
should have been resolved:
- Who are the Claimants?
- How and when did the Claimants invest in the Argentine Republic?
- What is the “investment” made by the Claimants?

- Does King and Spalding have a valid Power of Attorney ?

3. In the Award the term “Claimants” is used not only to refer to the three named Claimants
- Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercanias S.A., and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. — but

also to Air Comet, Interinvest, and/or other entities and individuals operating with the

Marsans Group. I cannot agree with this particularly because Claimants do not spell out

the ownership structure of the Marsans Group.

4. It may be useful at the outset to review the facts regarding the identity of the numerous
parties involved. It is crucial that we identify the “Claimants” and distinguish them from
other parties or non-entities. It is only the three named Claimants who can be considered
as asserting their own “rights” and claiming their “reliefs” for the infringement of their
rights of which only the Claimants can claim protection of the Argentina-Spain Bilateral

Investment Treaty (“BIT” or “Treaty”).

IDENTITY OF CLAIMANTS
5. The three named Claimants have failed to establish their investment in Argentina which
is protected by the BIT. The facts surrounding the identity of the Claimants are set out

below.

6. In the 1980s the Government of Argentina (“GOA”) initiated a general privatization
process pursuant to which the state-owned Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad del Estado
(“AASE”) was to be privatized. In 1990 AASE’s assets were transferred to a newly-
formed company named Aerolineas Argentina Sociedad Anénima (“ARSA”) which was
acquired by a group of investors including the Spanish state-owned airline Iberia Lineas
Aéreas de Espaiia, S.A. (“Iberia”). Iberia controlled 20% of the shares, other Spanish
investors 9.5%, and Argentine investors 55.5%. Subsequently, between 1990 and 1996,

the Spanish Government increased its participation in ARSA from 20% to 84%.

7. In 1971 Austral Lineas Aéreas, S.A. (“Austral”) was formed by the merger of two
privately-owned airlines Austral Compania Argentina de Transportes Aéreos Comercial
e Industrial and Aerotranportes Litoral Argentino. In 1985, Austral was purchased by
Cielos del Sur S.A., a holding company, which became Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A
(“AUSA”). During 1991 Iberia Lineas Aéreas de Espaiia, S.A. (“Iberia”) a Spanish state-
owned airline acquired Cielos del Sur. By 1991, the Spanish Government acquired
AUSA and became a significant shareholder in both ARSA and AUSA (collectively
referred to as the Argentine Airlines). It may be noteworthy that the Spain-Argentina BIT

came into force on 28 September 1992.

8. In 1994, Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest S.A.
(“Interinvest’”), to serve as the holding company for the Spanish investments in the
Argentine Airlines. As a result, Interinvest became the Argentine Airlines’ controlling

shareholder.

9. In 1995, the Spanish Government constituted Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones
Industriales (SEPT) to operate as the holding company for all companies fully or partially
owned by the Spanish Government. As a consequence, SEPI acquired Iberia’s

shareholding participation in Interinvest.

10. In 2001, the Argentine Airlines were owned by SEPI. SEPI was a holding company for
all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish government. SEPI owned the
Argentine Airlines through an Argentine intermediary company called Interinvest. SEPT
owned 99.2% of Interinvest, and Interinvest in turn held 92.1% of ARSA’s shares and
90% of AUSA’s shares.’ By mid 2001 the Argentine Airlines were experiencing financial
difficulties and ARSA filed for bankruptcy reorganization. In 2001 SEPI announced it

would sell its participation in Interinvest through a bidding process.

11. Air Comet, a Spanish company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) dated
October 2, 2001 with SEPI for the purchase of shares in Interinvest for a consideration of
United States Dollar One (US$ 1). It is important to note that Air Comet is not a

Claimant in this arbitration.

12. The changes in the shareholding of Air Comet were as follows:

2001:

In 2001 the shareholders in Air Comet were as follow:

July 2006: Teinver purchased the shareholding of Proturin and Segetur.

2006-2007: There were changes in the share structure of Air Comet several times, which
becomes majority shareholder of Air Comet and the shareholding in Air Comet stood as
follows:

October 2, 2007:

Teinver - 56%

Autobuses Urbanos -22%
Transportes de Cercanias -22%

December 31, 2007, Teinver purchased additional shares from Transportes de Cercanias
so that the shareholdings in Air Comet stood as follows:

Teinver - 66.67%
Autobuses Urbanos -22%
Transportes de Cercanias -11.33%

December 11 2008:

Request for Arbitration was received by ICSID from the Claimants on 11 December
2008, on which date the shareholding in Air Comet stood as follows:

Teinver - 96.77%

Autobuses Urbanos -2.13%

Transportes de Cercanias -1.1%

. On 30 January 2009 ICSID registered the Request and notified the parties, the case being

registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1.

. Two of the Claimants held shares in Air Comet, which was a Spanish company, when Air

Comet entered into the SPA with SEPI by investing US$1 to acquire the shares of
Interinvest, an Argentine company, holding shares of the Argentine Airlines. The third
Claimant, Teinver, was not even a shareholder of Air Comet when Air Comet acquired
the shares from SEPI through the SPA. Teinver cannot claim to have “acquired their
investment” by way of the SPA between Air Comet and SEPI when Teinver was not even

a shareholder of Air Comet. Similarly, for the other two Claimants (Spanish companies),

a

their shareholding in Air Comet (another Spanish company) cannot constitute an

“investment” in the Argentine Airlines under the Spain-Argentine BIT.

. Since Air Comet is not a Claimant, the burden of proof rests on the three named

Claimants to prove that their “investment” in the Argentine Airlines, to show what
liabilities were assumed, and what contributions were made by each of the Claimants to
the Argentine Airlines. Claimants have not discharged this burden of proof to show that
their shares in Air Comet, a Spanish limited liability company, falls within the definition
of “investment” under the BIT. Claimants made no financial contribution (since they
were not parties to the SPA) and assumed no liabilities under the SPA. The liabilities
were assumed by Air Comet, and not by Claimants. The rights of Claimants do not exist
independently of the rights of Air Comet. Claimants have not satisfied how their

shareholding rights in Air Comet can be treated as a protected investment under the BIT.

. No shares in Argentine Airlines were ever sold to the three named Claimants. Claimants

had the burden of showing when the shares in the Argentine Airlines were sold to the
three Claimants, which they have failed to do. The SPA between Air Comet and SEPI
does not provide proof of acquisition of shares by the Claimants, given the fact that the

Claimants were not even parties to the SPA.

. Claimants’ shares in Air Comet were not shares in Argentine entities. Air Comet was a

company incorporated in Spain. Claimants were all Spanish shareholders with no

connection to Argentina. The Claimants’ shareholding in Air Comet (under the laws of
Spain) could not have been an investment “acquired or effected in accordance with the
legislation of” Argentina or “shares in Argentine entities”. The Claimants’ shareholdings

thus fail to meet the territoriality requirement of the BIT?

MARSANS GROUP

18. The composition and legal character of the “Marsans Group” remain undefined. It is
evident that the “Marsans Group” is not a legal entity nor can it be treated as a party to
these proceedings. “Marsans Group” is also not party to any agreement related to the
transactions involved in these proceedings. Assertions that Claimants were “part of the
Marsans Group,”*, a Spanish consortium that was owned by the late Mr. Gonzalo Pascual
Arias and by Mr. Gerardo Diaz Ferran, do not give them any locus standi in this
arbitration. To make matters even more complex, the assets of the so-called Marsans

Group, including Teinver, were sold by Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias to a

1. The term "investments" in Article I of the BIT is defined to mean “any kind of assets, such as property and
rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the
investment and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:

- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;

The content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined
by the laws and regulations of the Party in whose territory the investment is situated. ...

4. The term "territory" shall mean the land territory of each Party, as well as the exclusive economic
zone and the continental shelf beyond the limits of the territorial sea of each Party over which it has or may
have, in accordance with international law, jurisdiction and sovereign rights for the purposes of
prospection, exploration and conservation of natural resources.

19.On April 14, 2010 Claimants entered into the “Burford Funding Agreement” with
Burford Capital Limited (“the Funder” or “Burford”), an investment company
headquartered in Guernsey, Channel Islands. The Burford Funding Agreement which
concerned the financing of Claimants’ litigation expenses in this arbitration. Respondent
has argued that Burford is a “vulture fund” that will be the primary beneficiary of any

ICSID award in this case.

allocations from any compensation paid to the Claimants by the Tribunal:

30% of the net recovery amount between $100 million and $500 million

25% of the net recovery amount between $500 million and $800 million

undefined group which was neither a party to the SPA, nor was it named as a Claimant,

can clearly not be treated as Claimant. In these proceedings Claimants can only be those

entities or persons who have instituted the arbitration, in other words, Claimants-on-

record.

These Claimants on record are:

TRANSPORTES DE CERCANIAS S.A.

AUTOBUSES URBANOS DEL SUR S.A.

TEINVER S.A.

None of the three Claimants nor “the Marsans Group”, the late Mr. Gonzalo Pascual
Arias, Mr. Gerardo Diaz Ferran, or Burford were a party to the SPA dated October 2,
2001. It was Air Comet which invested US$1 to acquire the shares of Interinvest in
Argentine Airlines. Air Comet, however, is not a Claimant. The Claimants were not

parties to the SPA and undertook no contractual responsibilities under the SPA.

The real identity of the “Claimants” is not an issue that can remain unresolved. Equally
important is how and when any investment was made by the three named Claimants,

which can claim to be protected under the BIT.

The scope of protection that can be claimed and granted to parties could be gathered from
the provisions of the BIT. The BIT will have to be reasonably construed, giving due

weight to the object of the BIT as set out in the following terms:

The Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as "the
Parties",

10

Desiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both
countries,

1; di 1

to create f conditions for in made by investors of
either State in the territory of the other State,

Recognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with
this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field.”

26. The Claimants Memorial on Merits (“CMM”) states in paragraph 2 that “Claimants
purchased the Argentine Airlines in 2001 and operated them until the GOA nationalized
them in 2008”. There are a number of statements in the CMM which instead of clarifying
the identity of the Claimants obscures it by confusing references to Claimants with

references to Air Comet and/or to the Marsans Group as summarized below:

(a) In paragraph 34 of the CMM it is stated that out of nine offers SEPI pre-selected

four bidders including the Claimants through Air Comet as part of the Marsans Group.

(b) In paragraph 35 it is stated that “SEPI ultimately selected Claimants’ offer.

(c) In paragraph 36 it is stated that “(a) Claimants offered certain synergies, (b) Air

Comet was owned by the Marsans Group” as explained by Gerardo Diaz Ferran, former

co-owner of Marsans Group.

(d) The Argentine Airlines was thus to become part of a larger network of companies

...”. We were owners of “Viajes Marsans, the number one travel agency in Spain ... Air

11

Comet which operated charter flights to the Caribbean, South America and Canary

Island”.

(e) In paragraph 40 it is stated that: “on 2 October 2001, SEPI and Air Comet
entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) through which the latter acquired
99.2% of the share of Interinvest while the purchase price was US$1, and Claimants

undertook a number financial commitments:

e To assume Interinvest’s, ARSA’s and AUSA’s liabilities (ARSA’s liabilities at
the time were in excess of US$1 billion);

e To retain ARSA’s and AUSA’s personnel for a period of two years;

e To maintain a majority interest in the Argentine Airlines for a period of two years;

e To restart flights on existing routes and develop new routes as soon as possible;

e To make a US$50 million capital contribution; and

e To modernize and expand the airlines’ fleet.

WHAT IS THE INVESTMENT? WHO MADE THE INVESTMENTS, WHEN AND

HOW?

27. As indicated above, instead of clarifying the identity of the Claimants the averments
reproduced above have made this task difficult, if not impossible. This is further evident
from the averments made regarding who are the investors and what investments are

claimed to have been made by them and on what dates. These are summarized below:

12

28. In Paragraph 41 of the CMM it is stated that:

(a) “In exchange for these commitments, SEPI agreed to contribute up to US$248

million to be applied by Claimants’ Air Comet in the implementation of a business plan,

(b) US$300 million to be applied to the payment of specific pre-existing debts. In
addition, given that the financial statements upon which SEPI launched the bidding
process and Claimants made their offer were updated as of July 2001, SEPI later agreed
to contribute an additional amount of US$205 million to cover the operational losses

suffered by the Argentine Airlines between July and October 2001.”

.In Paragraph | of the Claimants’ Post Hearing Brief (“CPHB”), it is stated that the
Claimants rely on their memorials which are hereby incorporated by reference, and then

go on to state in paragraph 7 as follows:

“7, During the merits hearing, Argentina argued that Claimants’ invested “not
even one peso” in the Argentine Airlines. But in fact, Claimants and their
subsidiaries invested millions of dollars in the Argentine Airlines. Claimants
made cash contributions of US$13.5 million in Interinvest, US$9.9 million in
ARSA, and US$0.8 million in AUSA. KPMG confirmed it. Further, Claimants
also reinvested in the Argentine Airlines the US$106 million in profits that ARSA

and AUSA made during 2002, 2003, and 2004.”

13

30. The averments made in the pleadings, in the CMM and CPHB somewhat disingenuously
refer to Grupo Marsans as the Claimants without any attempt to define the composition
and character of Grupo Marsans or to explain how an undefined consortium, embracing a
large number of entities (according to one report, consisting of at least 117 companies)
can be referred to as Claimants disregarding the fact that there are three named Claimants
of which one (Teinver) did not even acquire any shares before 2006/2007. Example of

such averments are summarized below:

(a) In paragraph 4 of the CPHB the Claimants expert Ricover is quoted as saying that
“T do not see any reasons to support that Grupo Marsans was not running the Argentine

Airlines efficiently”

(b) in the next paragraph 5, it is stated that “Claimants have demonstrated that these
achievements were direct consequences of their investments and sound management of

the Argentine Airlines.”

(c) In paragraph 6 Grupo Marsans is indicated to have been the bidder which had
entered into SPA, blatantly ignoring the fact that it was Air Comet which was bidder and

party to the SPA.

(d) Matters are not made clearer, by the further averments in paragraph 6 as follows:

This Tribunal already acknowledged the complexity of this transaction in which

14

Claimants and other companies of Grupo Marsans made a number of significant
commitments”. It is noteworthy that Air Comet did not institute the arbitration as a

Claimant.

. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention limit’s the Centre’s jurisdiction to the legal disputes
arising ‘directly out of an investment’. While the term ‘investment’ has been construed
widely, it is not without limits. The key to determining whether a activity constitutes an
investment is not “the area of economic activity covered, but the form and nature of that
activity”. In Fedax NV v Republic of Venezuela’ the basic features of an investment
have been described as involving a certain duration, a certain regularity of profit and
return, assumption of risk, a substantial commitment and a significance for the host
State’s development. Schreuer observes that the ICSID Convention ‘does not imply
unlimited freedom for parties...the term “investment” has an objective meaning

independent of the parties’ disposition’.

32. The Spain-Argentina BIT contains a definition of ‘investment’ and provides that:

The term "investments" shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights
of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the
country receiving the investment and in particular, but not exclusively, the
following:
- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;
-Rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of
creating economic value, including loans directly linked with a specific
investment, whether capitalized or not;
- Movable and immovable property and real rights such as mortgages,
privileges, sureties, usufructs and similar rights;

° ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3.

15

-Any kind of rights in the field of intellectual property, including patents,
trade marks, manufacturing licenses and know-how;

- Concessions granted by law or by virtue of a contract for engaging in
economic and commercial activity, in particular those related to the
prospection, cultivation, mining or development of natural resources.

33. The Preamble to the Spain-Argentina BIT provides:

“The Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as
"the Parties",

Desiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both
countries,

Intending to create favourable conditions for investments made by investors of
either State in the territory of the other State,

Recognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with
this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field,

Have agreed as follows:”

The purpose of the BIT was the promotion and protection of investment and the creation of
favourable conditions for investments made by investors in the territory of the host state for

the “economic benefit” of the host state.

34. The relevant test for the Tribunal to determine whether it has jurisdiction is a “double
keyhole approach” or a “double-barreled” test. Claimants have to satisfy the requirements
of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Under the double-barreled test the activities

of Claimants have to meet the definition of “investment” in the BIT as well as the

16

“objective” criteria of an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention (as held in CSOB v Slovakia’, Salini v Morocco®, and Joy Mining v Egypt’).

35. The ICSID Convention expressly states in Article 25 clause (1):
“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly
out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision
or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in
writing to submit to the Centre.”
For the purpose of proper definition of “investment” we need to interpret Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention requires that courts and
arbitral tribunals shall interpret treaties “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object
and purpose”. The Vienna Convention specifically states that the preamble and the
annexes qualify part of the text for the purposes of interpretation (Article 31(2)) and that
context includes “any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation” and “(c) any relevant
tules of international law applicable” (Article 31(3)(b) and (c)). The current leading

decision on the definition of “investment” in ICSID arbitration, Salini v Morocco", has

existed for more than a decade. It laid down the test that requires investment to have four

elements: (i) a contribution of money or other assets; (ii) a certain duration; (iii) an

element of risk; (iv) a contribution to the host State’s development.

. Claimants’ had not transferred any financial resources to the host state, Argentina, when

Air Comet bought shares in the Argentine Airlines for US$1. The SPA did not involve
any contribution of assets by Claimants. Air Comet received payments from SEPI to meet
the liabilities of the Argentine Airlines. Air Comet made a nominal payment of US$1 for
the shares. There was no risk borne by Claimants. In relation to the activities or
obligations undertaken by Air Comet under the SPA:

- there was no transfer of financial resources from Claimants to Argentina;

- the SPA involved a one-off transaction and not of any certain duration;

- there was no risk borne by Claimants; and

- there was no substantial commitment or significant contribution to Argentina’s

development.

Acquiring of the shares by Air Comet and subsequent transfers to the three named

Claimants could not properly, therefore, be treated as protected “investment”.

The Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction is based on a prima facie assessment. The
Tribunal in Siemens AG v Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on

Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004) explained the position in the following terms:

“At this [jurisdictional] stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to
consider whether the claims under the Treaty made by Siemens are correct. This
is a matter for the merits. The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, if the

18

Claimant’s allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has
jurisdiction to consider them.” [emphasis added]

 

39. Nothing stated by the Tribunal at the jurisdictional phase is conclusive on the basic issue
to whether Claimants have rights which fall under the definition of “investments” as
contained in Article I of the BIT and in respect of which protection can be granted under

the BIT.

40. The identification of the “investment”, that is the subject matter of the present claim, and
the identities of the investors, who are entitled to claim damages, are crucial issues to be
determined at the merits stage. The alleged violation of the investors’ rights, and the
potential relief than can be awarded, will depend on the answer to the following
questions:

- What constituted the “investment”?
- Who are the investors? What are the identities of the investors who can claim
damages under the BIT?

41. In the present case, the identification of the “investment” is difficult since the investment

arises from a complex transaction under which Claimants were purportedly undertaking
responsibilities and risks in assuming debts and liabilities of the airlines going forward
and the undertaking to maintain and expand the operations of the airlines. The questions
which need to be answered at the outset are:

- Which Claimant assumed what liability?

19

42.

43.

44.

- Whether Claimants assumed liabilities, by what means, and in relation to which
creditors?

Regardless of the complexity of the transactions, Claimants’ “investment” of which they

seek protection under the BIT has to be identified.

Can the shares that Claimants held in Air Comet S.A., a Spanish limited liability
company, fall under the definition of “investment” which states that the “investment” has
to be “acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving
the investment” and that the “content and scope of the rights corresponding to the
various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party
in whose territory the investment is situated”? Do we not need to consider under which
Argentine law Claimants acquired rights which can be treated as “investment” under the

BIT?

It seems disingenuous for Claimants to allege making an “investment” in the Argentine
Airlines. The Argentine Airlines were in operation long before Claimants bought on
different dates (as late as 2006 in the case of Teinver) shares in Air Comet, a Spanish

company. We need to ask the further questions —

Whether and how did each of the Claimants acquire shares in Air Comet? Can
Claimants’ acquisition of shares, in the circumstances of the case, be treated as an

investment made “in accordance with the legislation of’ Argentina? What are the

20

content and scope of the rights acquired by Claimants as determined by Argentine

law?

45. Since there is no evidence that Claimants made any financial contribution which can be
characterized as “investment” in the Argentine Airlines, it is not clear how any right in

respect of Claimants’ shares in Air Comet can be said to be protected under the BIT.

46. The issue to be decided is whether Claimants (as shareholders of Air Comet) may claim
compensation for alleged violations of the BIT when Air Comet (the company which
actually held the shares in Interinvest, the holding company of the Argentine Airlines)
itself does not make such claims before the Tribunal. Claimants have failed to show how
their shareholder rights exist independent of the rights of Air Comet and how those

shareholder rights can be treated as a protected investment.

47. It is necessary to look at the precise content and scope of the rights which Claimants
allege are their investments and to consider whether these rights constitute investments

which can claim to be protected by the BIT.

48. The term "investments" in Article I of the BIT is defined to mean

“any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, acquired or
effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the
investment and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:

- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;

- Rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of creating
economic value, including loans directly linked with a specific investment, whether
capitalized or not;

21

49.

50.

- Movable and immovable property and real rights such as mortgages, privileges,
sureties, usufructs and similar rights;

- Any kind of rights in the field of intellectual property, including patents, trade marks,
manufacturing licenses and know-how;

- Concessions granted by law or by virtue of a contract for engaging in economic and
commercial activity, in particular those related to the prospection, cultivation, mining or
development of natural resources.

The content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets
shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party in whose territory the
investment is situated.

No modification in the legal forum in which assets and capital have been invested or
reinvested shall affect their status as investments in accordance with this Agreement.

3. The terms "investment income or earnings" shall mean returns from an investment in
accordance with the definition contained in the preceding paragraph and shall expressly
include profits, dividends and interest.

4. The term "territory" shall mean the land territory of each Party, as well as the
exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf beyond the limits of the territorial sea
of each Party over which it has or may have, in accordance with international law,
jurisdiction and sovereign rights for the purposes of prospection, exploration and
conservation of natural resources.

Claimants cannot claim that their rights in respect of which they claim protection of the
BIT were “acquired or affected in accordance with the legislation of the country
receiving the investment” (that is the Argentine law) since Claimants’ rights are those of

a shareholder of Air Comet S.A., a limited liability company in Spain.

The precise content and scope of the rights alleged by Claimants as being violated must

be identified and the question that must be answered is whether the rights of Claimants

can be treated as “investments” as defined in Article I of the BIT.

22

IV. ISSUE OF ADMISSIBILITY AND STANDING NOT ADDRESSED IN THE

DECISION ON JURISDICTION

51. The issue of the Power of Attorney of King & Spalding to represent Claimants arose in

the context of the insolvency proceedings in respect of Claimants and of Air Comet.

5

N

. Insolvency Proceedings were commenced in respect of each of the Claimants on the dates
as noted below:
-  Teinver in December 2010.
- Transportes de Cercanias in February 2011.
- Autobuses Urbanos del Sur in April 2012.

- Air Comet in March 2008."!

5

ow

. The issue for this Tribunal to determine is whether King & Spalding has valid powers of
attorney at the present stage of this arbitration, now that each of Claimants’
administrative powers have been suspended. Claimants argue that the powers of attorney
are still valid and that the Claimants’ reorganization administrators are simply “stepping
into the shoes” of Claimants for purposes of the continuation of this arbitration.
Respondent argues, to the contrary, that Claimants’ power of attorney was extinguished
by the bankruptcy, that a new power of attorney is needed, and that a valid new power of

attorney has not yet been granted to King & Spalding or anyone else.

" Vol. 6, page 994-998.

23

54. The bankruptcy of Air Comet and of all three Claimants is related to certain factual and
legal disputes in this case. First, Respondent has asserted that Claimants’ bankruptcy
terminated King & Spalding’s power of attorney to represent Claimants in this case.
Second, the Parties disagree on the causes of Claimants’ and Air Comet’s bankruptcy.
Claimants, through witness Diaz Ferran, assert that the bankruptcies were the direct result
of Respondent’s unlawful acts and policies towards the Airlines. Respondent argues that
the bankruptcies were due to reasons wholly unconnected to Respondent’s actions,
including Claimants’ poor business management, lack of liquidity and failure to make
payments. With respect to Air Comet’s bankruptcy, Respondent argues that the company
was in a state of bankruptcy as early as April 2008, predating the expropriation of the
Airlines later in 2008. These arguments with respect to the causation of the Claimants’

insolvencies are relevant to both Claimants’ claims and Respondent’s counterclaim.

55. Moreover, Respondent argues that King & Spalding’s attempts to “ratify” its power of
attorney fail. While Claimants have produced letters written by the trustees in insolvency
for each of the Claimants that purport to ratify the power of attorney, Respondent asserts
that these letters are flawed. It notes that the letters are not addressed directly to ICSID
but rather to the King &Spalding attorneys representing Claimants. It also notes that the
letters are undated, and that they do not appear to have been notarized. Finally,
Respondent notes that the letters appear to have been executed unilaterally by the
trustees, and do not appear to be the result of an order from a commercial court of
Madrid. According to Respondent, the trustees lack the right to ratify the acts taken by

King & Spalding and to authorize the firm to carry on its activities. Respondent asserts

24

5

5

5

a

7.

oo

that “every lawyer is aware that, in order for a power of attorney to be renewed within the
context of an insolvency proceeding, there must be a court order authorizing such

renewal.”

. Claimants argue that the reorganization administrators “are not required to seek

authorization from the courts hearing Claimants’ reorganization proceedings,” noting that
“{iJn accordance with Article 51(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law, the court’s
authorization would only be required in order to withdraw, to accept a claim, in whole or

in part, and to settle disputes”.

With respect to the power of attorney granted to King & Spalding, Claimants’ expert
witness Aurora Martinez Florez asserts that after the suspension of powers, the board of
trustees directly steps into the shoes of the debtor in the agreements and powers of

attorney granted by the debtor before the declaration of bankruptcy.

. With respect to Article 48(3) of the Bankruptcy Law, which provides that “Any power of

attorney existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency proceedings shall be
affected by the suspension or control of financial and property-related powers,” Martinez

Florez argues that “affected” does not mean that powers of attorney are terminated.

59. The Respondent’s expert J.J. Cigaran Magan has testified that

Page 987, lines

12 .... Well, I think that in the courts, it is a
13 basic, essential rule, and any attorney knows that

25

14 they cannot go to a court without Powers of Attorney
15 granted in notarial instruments.

60. The onus was on the Claimants of proving that their standing and the continued capacity
of their lawyers to represent them subsisted after the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings. This onus has not been discharged. The undated non-notarized letters from
the trustees in insolvency which were not directly addressed to this Tribunal cannot be
accepted as proof that King & Spalding fulfilled the legal requirement for representing

the Claimants after the insolvency proceedings had commenced.

6

. The issue is further complicated by the third party funding arrangement which exists
under the Burford Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement, with effective date
April 14, 2010, is between
(i) Teinver S.A.,

(ii) Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and

understood how these individuals, not being Claimants, could execute the Funding
Agreement which states in the recital that
. Claimant “requires funding to meet the costs of preparing, submitting and

enforcing the Claim”,

. Claimant “sought to make arrangements to obtain funds”,
. Claimant “has approached the Funder”,
. and Funder has a “common legal interest” with the Claimant.
. Gonzalo Pascual Arias and Gerardo Diaz Ferran are persons against whom the Spanish

authorities had initiated criminal proceedings for embezzlement, and who have since
been convicted by the Spanish Courts. The criminal proceedings against Gonzalo Pascual
Arias (now deceased) and Gerardo Diaz Ferran (now convicted and serving sentence in a

Spanish prison) is dealt with in a separate section below.

. The Funding Agreement was not executed by Air Comet, which was a party to the SPA

and arguably may claim to have made an investment under the BIT. The reason Air
Comet did not, and could not, execute the Funding Agreement was that by April 14, 2010

Air Comet was already in insolvency proceedings.

. On January 4, 2010 ICSID informed that parties that the present Tribunal had been

constituted. The Funding Agreement, by which Burford got involved in this arbitration,
was executed within about four months from the constitution of the Tribunal, and well

before the filing of the Claimants’ Memorial on Merits dated September 29, 2010.

27

66. The Funding Agreement states

“WHEREAS

(A) Burford Capital Limited is an investment company headquartered in Guernsey and
publicly traded on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.

(B) The Claimant requires funding to meet the costs of preparing, submitting, conducting
and enforcing the Claim (as defined below). The Claimant has therefore sought to make
arrangements to obtain funds for such purpose that would allow repayment of such funds
to the Funder, plus consideration for the attendant risk, to be conditional upon recovery of
proceeds from the Claim.

(C) The Claimant has approached the Funder and for this purpose. The Funder has
concluded that the Claim is meritorious and the Funder has a common legal interest with
the Claimant in seeing that such Claim is pursued adequately.”

6

x

. Schedule 2 of the Funding Agreement states:

“The Recovery Amount shall be determined and distributed as follows.

1.First, the Expenses paid by the Funder shall be repaid to it and the Funder shall also
receive a priority return of three times the Expenses.

2. Any premiums or success fees due to counsel shall be paid.

3. The amount remaining after those payments shall be the “Net Recovery Amount”
which shall be allocated as follows:

3.1 In the event of a Settlement within twelve month of the Effective Date, 20% of
Net Recovery Amount to Funder and the remainder to the Claimant, provided however
that the total Recovery Amount payable to the Funder pursuant to section | and this
section 3.1 shall not exceed 25% of the Award less the Expenses.

3.2 Absent such a settlement,

40% of the first US$100 million of Net Recovery Amount to the Funder,

30% of any Net Recovery Amount between US$100 million and US$500 million to the
Funder,

25% of any Net Recovery Amount between US$500 million and US$800 million to the
Funder, and

15% of any Net Recovery Amount above US$800 million to the Funder, in each case
with the remainder to the Claimant.

4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Funder shall be entitled [to] receive a
minimum amount so as to provide the Funder with an internal rate of return of not less
than 50%.”

6

oo

. Clause 6 of the Funding Agreement states
“6.1 In consideration of the Funder’s undertakings in this Agreement, the Claimant

agrees to pay the Funder the Recovery Amount immediately following receipt of all or
any part of the Award...

28

69.

70.

71.

6.2 ... if the Claimant comes into possession of any Award proceeds, it shall immediately
pay all such proceeds immediately to the Nominated Lawyers [King & Spalding LLP] or
the escrow agent. The Claimant and the Funder both direct the Nominated Lawyers or the
escrow agent to pay the Recovery Amount to the Funder as soon as practicable, to pay
any outstanding invoices and to pay the remainder to the Claimant.”

As would be evident from the Funding Agreement (in particular clauses 6.1 and 6.2) the
Funder, which is not an “investor” under the BIT, is intended to be the principal
beneficiary, along with the Nominated Lawyers, of the proceeds of any award. The award
proceeds are to be immediately paid to the Nominated Lawyers (King & Spalding LLP)
or an escrow agent for payment to the Funder and payment of any outstanding invoices

(including those of the Nominated Lawyers). Only the remainder will be paid to

Claimant.

Despite not being an “investor” under the BIT and the funds provided by Burford not
being “protected investment” under the BIT, these proceedings have continued because
Burford and the Nominated Lawyers have been assured of receiving significant amounts
from any award which may be made by the ICSID Tribunal. Burford is a third party and
as the Respondent states “is abusing the ICSID system by bringing forward a claim that is
contrary to the purposes and goals of the Convention in order to make astronomical

profits” .

In addition, according to Schedule 2, paragraph 4 of the Funding Agreement, Burford is

guaranteed an internal rate of return of not less than 50% on its “investment”.

29

72. Burford may have “invested” in the present arbitration proceedings by agreeing to fund
the legal expenses but such an “investment” based on speculating on the prospect of
obtaining a substantial portion the proceeds of any award resulting from a pending
arbitration cannot be treated as protected “investment” under the BIT. The BIT
guarantees the rights of “investors” who have made an “investment” in the territory of the
host state. The BIT is not intended to enable payment of awards to third party funders
who are not “investors” and who have no protected “investment”, and who only come
into the situation in the circumstances described above to advance funds in order to

speculate on the outcome of a pending arbitration.

73. The practice of third party funding investment arbitration continues to be criticized by
academics and professionals. The Funder’s role in this case may well be characterized as
“champerty”, which has long been considered under English common law as being
against public policy as it encourages vexatious litigation. A contract may be void for
champerty, though it may not strictly amount to criminal offence. The purchase of a law
suit by an attorney is champerty in its most odious form as has been held in a judgment of

the English Chancery Division:

So odious in the eyes of the law are these contracts, that they confer no rights on the

parties making them, and if one pay out money under them he cannot recover it. 7

74. Burford cannot, on any reasonable construction be characterized as an investor entitled to
protection under the BIT. The Tribunal cannot, in these circumstances, be considered to

have jurisdiction to grant an award to a party, such as Burford, which is not an investor

under the BIT and has made no “investment” which can claim to be protected by the BIT.

. The questions about how any activities of the Marsans Group can be attributed to the

Claimants remain pertinent.

It was not the Claimants but Air Comet which had entered into the SPA with SEPI.
Claimants were not a party to the SPA. The Claimants’ management of the Argentine
Airlines is not established, nor have their claim, or what they had “invested”. The burden

of proof was on Claimants and they have failed to discharge it.

Air Comet, the party to the SPA, received from SEPI US$300 million which was to be
used for liquidating ARSA’s liabilities. There is no evidence that Air Comet used the
funds for the purpose stipulated in the SPA. So there can be no basis for a claim by Air
Comet nor by the three named Claimants as indirect shareholders of Air Comet to be

treated as an “investor”.

. Since the Marsans Group are not Claimants and indeed the composition and status of the

Marsans Group have remained undefined, no alleged contribution of the so-called

Marsans Group can be treated as “investment” within the meaning of the BIT.

. Mr Gerardo Diaz Ferran has been found criminally liable and sentenced to two years and

two months’ imprisonment by the Judgment of the Spanish Central Criminal Court No.1

31

(RA 669). The judgment (RA 669) sheds clear light on how through a complex set of
transactions the funds which were meant to be applied to liquidate the liabilities of ARSA
(and if indeed had they been applied might be treated as an “investment”) had in fact
been misappropriated.

80. The relevant portions of the Spanish Court Judgment (RA 669) are reproduced below:

“ESTABLISHED FACTS

In accordance with the private agreement entered into between AIR COMET and its
shareholders on 3 December 2001, which was notarially recorded on the same day, AIR
COMET S.A. irrevocably agreed that the claims acquired would only be used as funds of

its own_to_ increase capital or make irrevocable capital contributions to ARSA_and

 

undertook to fulfil such c i within_six_months as from approval of ARSA’s
Reorganization Plan. If the claims were not used as agreed upon, SEPI would be entitled

to require the parties to repay any sum that was otherwise allocated.

In view of the fact that the claims assigned to AIR COMET remained effective, AIR

COMET obtained a benefit since these claims were acquired using funds provided by

SEPI for no valuable consideration.

Thus no investment can be said to have made by Air Comet. The Spanish Court Judgment (RA

669) further concludes:

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

32

Nonetheless, in reality, the millions of dollars given by SEPI to meet INTERINVEST’s
liabilities were used by AIR COMET to purchase the claims, thereby subrogating to the
rights of ARSA’s creditor and participating in its reorganization proceedings (Report

issued by the Spanish Court of Audit).

It is thus evident that Air Comet was the only holder of the claims acquired through the

USD 300 million provided by SEPI.

In accordance with the agreement of 3 December 2001 between AIR COMET and its
shareholders (Transportes de Cercanias, Busursa, Segetur and Viajes Marsans), the
company [Air Comet] undertook to acquire a series of claims [debts]to be paid by ARSA,

thus subrogating to the rights of the creditors.

It may be noted that the two of the three named Claimants were not shareholders of Air Comet at
the relevant time. Regarding the fraud committed by Air Comet the Spanish Court Judgment

(RA 669) noted:

.. The claims acquired were used to increase ARSA’s capital. Therefore, AIR COMET
ended up increasing its stake in ARSA by using funds granted by SEPI to
INTERINVEST, which were aimed at paying ARSA’s liabilities.

..Jn fact, since AIR COMET acquired the claims —assets— without having the necessary

funds to do so —with funds granted by INTERINVEST-— this was actually an assignment

33

for no consideration, a gift or a case of unjust enrichment, if not a mere present given
by the donor. The ultimate beneficiary was AIR COMET, since it was its value that

increased, and this fact cannot be concealed.

The claims were not settled. If they had, they would have produced no benefits, which is
the theory advanced by the accused at trial in stating that Air Comet was “a simple
agent”. However, since those claims remained effective, Air Comet, in acquiring them,
received the benefit deriving from its inclusion as a new creditor in ARSA’s

reorganization.

..Jn this respect, Judgment STS 979/2011 should be highlighted, among others: “The
companies constitute a business structure that is controlled by a single person (in this
case, the accused and their companies). There is no separation of assets in the conduct of
their business that justifies the conclusion that they operate independently of each other.
Their respective personalities are nothing but a front. There is actually a single
economic structure that is used to commit fraud or to harm a third party and thus
cannot enjoy the protection granted by the law to an entity that has a legal personality

of its own”.

. From the above judgment the following facts become clear that under the SPA by which

Air Comet obtained shares of Interinvest for USD 1, SEPI had provided USD300,000 for

the reduction of liabilities of Argentine Airlines and Air Comet had undertaken to utilize

34

8

8

8

8:

Nv

w

&

n

that amount for the specific purpose of reduction of liabilities of Argentine Airlines. This

was not done.

. Despite contributions by SEPI for reducing the liabilities of ARSA the fact is that ARSA

remained indebted since the obligations undertaken by Air Comet in the SPA were not
fulfilled. The assertion that Air Comet “invested” that amount is, in fact, palpably
unwarranted. The millions of dollars given by SEPI to meet Interinvest’s liabilities were
not so used but were used by Air Comet to purchase the claims. This cannot be treated as

an investment of Air Comet in the Argentine Airlines.

. The effect of this transaction was that the Interinvest’s liabilities (and Argentine Airlines’

liabilities) continued to be liabilities while Air Comet illegally acquired claims over the

Argentine Airlines through fraudulent means.

. Through the fraud so committed harm was caused to the Argentine Airlines to the extent

that SEPI funds meant for reducing the liabilities of the Argentine Airlines were not so
used, but were actually used to increase the share capital of Air Comet. Such a misuse of
the funds which were intended to reduce the liabilities, but were misappropriated, cannot

be regarded as Claimants’ “investment”.

. Air Comet’s acquisition has been found by the Spanish Court to have been “an

assignment for no consideration, a gift or a case of unjust enrichment”.

35

86. The Spanish Court has found that in this transaction there is “actually a single economic
structure that is used to commit fraud or to harm a third party [the Argentine

Airlines] and thus cannot enjoy the protection granted by the law”.

87. In such a situation, where a Spanish Court has found that a fraud had been committed by
Air Comet and Mr Ferran to harm the Argentine Airlines, it cannot be legally tenable to
treat such misuse of the funds as an “investment” which may seek the protection of the

BIT.

ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
PROVISION

88. My concerns regarding the identity of the Claimants are also relevant in assessing the
Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Government of Argentina and

Interinvest (“the July 2008 Agreement”).'

89. The crucial issue remains that none of the three Claimants were parties to this July 2008
Agreement and thus had no rights under the July 2008 Agreement. As Professor Kinsbury
has stated in his expert opinion an investor cannot invoke commitments under an
agreement unless it is “a contract between the Claimant and the Government”. I am in
agreement with Professor Kinsbury and am of the view that since none of the three

named Claimants were parties to the July 2008 Agreement they cannot claim for

' Claimant's Exhibit C-190.

36

contractual breaches of that July 2008 Agreement. Further, in Professor Kinsbury’s

opinion a simple breach of contract cannot be regarded as a breach of the BIT.'*

9

S

. The issue is whether the Claimants can claim a treaty breach under the BIT for any
violations of the July 2008 Agreement between Interinvest and the Argentine
Government. If there was a breach Interinvest, being an Argentine company, could not
claim under the Spain-Argentina BIT. Air Comet, the Spanish shareholders of Interinvest,
did not lodge any claims before this Tribunal and are not the Claimants. I am of the view
that Claimants do not have standing to bring claims for treaty breaches for any alleged

violations of the contractual terms of the July 2008 Agreement by Argentina.

9

. The factual and legal context of the July 2008 Agreement is important in order to assess

breaches of the Claimants’ treaty rights by the Respondent.

9:

N

. The July 2008 Agreement was executed between Argentina and Interinvest since a
potential investor, Mr. Mena, withdrew and “the reason Mr. Lopex Mena withdrew from
the acquisition of the Airlines was that he could never have sufficient information of the
economic, financial and operational situation of the Airlines because, as was said, the

Marsans Group did not provide the necessary information”.'°

9.

wo

. It is important that the July 2008 Agreement is not an agreement for sale of shares. The
price of the shares which were to be transferred from Interinvest, arguably the most

' Respondent’s PHB, Para 134.
'S Exhibit RA 555; Respondent’s PHB, Para 144.

37

crucial element of any transfer of shares, remained to be agreed between Interinvest and

the Respondent.

9.

&

. The main disagreement between Interinvest and Argentina that led to the failure of the
July 2008 Agreement was the price valuation of the Argentine Airlines. Regardless of the
price valuation, it was an agreed position that the financial condition of the Argentine
Airlines was very bad — Respondent characterizes the Airlines as being “in truly bankrupt

condition”’®

and Claimants assert that by mid 2008 “the Argentine Airline’s financial
condition hit its worst point since Claimants acquired them in October 2001”"”. It may be
pertinent that in 2001 when the SPA was executed the valuation of the Argentine Airlines
was US$1. If the financial position in July 2008 was worse than that in 2001 then it
appears that the Respondent’s negative valuation (as conducted by TTN) of the Airlines

is more credible than the Claimants’ non-independent valuation conducted by Credit

Suisse.

9:

n

. Since the price of the shares was not agreed between Interinvest and the Respondent, I
cannot agree with the conclusion in paragraph 782 of the Award that the July 2008
memorandum “constituted a binding agreement between Interinvest and the Government
of Argentina pursuant to which the two parties agreed to the purchase and sale of
Interinvest’s shares in the Airlines on the terms set out in the Agreement”. Since the price
was not agreed, the memorandum of July 2008 (referred to as July 2008 Agreement)
cannot be treated as a binding agreement for the sale and purchase of the Airlines. A

'® Respondent’s Counter Memorial, Para 478; Respondent’s Rejoinder, Para 466.
" Claimant’s Reply, Para 287.

38

binding agreement for sale was yet to be reached upon agreement of the price between
the parties. The failure to reach an agreement cannot be treated as a breach of the treaty
rights of the Claimants. There was no guarantee from the Government that the shares of
the Airlines would be purchased. The July 2008 Agreement was merely an agreement to
explore for a limited period of 60 days the possibility of a purchase of shares provided

that the price valuation could be carried out.

or

a

. The failure of the parties to agree to appoint an independent expert cannot be attributed as
a treaty breach of the Claimants’ rights under the BIT by the Respondent. The
Respondent has consistently held that Interinvest failed to provide financial information
required under the July 2008 Agreement.'* Mr Munoz Perez also confirmed that even
Credit Suisse valuation was done on the basis of a “Business Plan” prepared by “the
Board of Directors of the Marsans Group”.'? A credible valuation by Credit Suisse would
have required the auditors to independently to verify or carry out any audit the
documents. This was not done. I cannot agree with the Tribunal that Respondent’s

complaints regarding the Credit Suisse valuation were formal and artificial.

9

x

-I am of the view that the 2008 Agreement contained no commitments from the
Respondent to the three named Claimants. The 2008 Agreement was not a binding
agreement for the sale of shares but was a memorandum to explore the option of the sale
of shares provided the price of the shares could be agreed at and other conditions could

be met within a transition period of 60 days, which expired on 14 October 2008. For

' Respondent’s PHB, Para 40, citing testimony of M Perez, transcript p.489.

39

98

these reasons, the 2008 Agreement cannot be the basis of finding a treaty breach of

obligations owed to the three named Claimants by the Respondent.

. In conclusion, for all the reasons stated above, I consider and find that this Tribunal has

no jurisdiction to grant reliefs under the Argentina-Spain Treaty to the Claimants in the
form of declarations set out in paragraphs 1148 (a)-(c) or the directions set out in
paragraphs 1148 (d)-(g) of the majority award, as Claimants have failed to establish that
they are investors entitled to protection under the Treaty or that their investments in
respect of which protection was sought are protected investments under the Treaty. With
due respect to my co-arbitrators, I cannot concur in the majority award and enter this

dissenting opinion.

I. Facts Relevant to Jurisdiction

a. Parties

This claim is brought by Teinver S.A. (“Teinver”), Transportes de Cercanias S.A. (“Transportes
de Cercanias”) and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. (“Autobuses Urbanos”) (collectively,
“Claimants”), all companies incorporated in the Kingdom of Spain, against the Argentine
Republic (“Respondent”), under the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the
Kingdom of Spain on the Promotion and Protection of Investments of October 3, 1991 (the
“Treaty”).! Claimants are members of a group of companies known collectively as the Grupo
Marsans.

b. Dispute

This dispute concerns Claimants’ allegations that Respondent has violated the Treaty,
international law, and Argentine law, as well as commitments and representations made by the
Respondent to Claimants, by unlawfully re-nationalizing and taking other measures regarding
Claimants’ investments in two Argentine airlines: Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (“ARSA”) and
Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A. (“AUSA”) (collectively, “the Argentine Airlines”).?

i. Acquisition of the Argentine Airlines

By 1991, the Spanish government, through asset purchases made by the state-owned airline
Iberia Lineas Aéreas de Espajfia, S.A. (“Iberia”), was a significant shareholder in both of the
Argentine Airlines. In 1994, Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest
S.A. (“Interinvest”), to serve as the holding company for the Spanish investments in the
Argentine airline industry In 1995, the Spanish government created the Sociedad Estatal de
Participaciones Industriales (“SEPI”’) to operate as the holding company for all companies fully
or partially owned by the Spanish government.’ As such, SEPI acquired Iberia’s shareholdings
in Interinvest at that time.

By mid-2001, the Argentine Airlines were experiencing financial difficulties, and ARSA filed
for bankruptcy reorganization.> In June 2001, SEPI announced that it would sell its participation
in Interinvest through a bidding process. At the time, SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest, and in
turn Interinvest held 92.1% of ARSA’s shares and 90% of AUSA’s shares.° Air Comet S.A.
(“Air Comet”), a Spanish subsidiary of Grupo Marsans, bid on Interinvest and won. At this time,

' The authentic language of the Treaty is the Spanish text. This Decision will generally refer to the English-
language translation (Ex. C-1(ENG)), although it will revert to the authentic Spanish text where the translation is
ambiguous or otherwise unsatisfactory.

Air Comet was owned by two of the three Claimants, Autobuses Urbanos (35%) and Transportes
de Cercanias (35%), as well as by two other Spanish companies, Proturin S.A. (29.8%) and
Segetur S.A. (0.2%).’ (Claimant Teinver became a shareholder of Air Comet later, that is, on
July 20, 2006, when it purchased Proturin’s and Segetur’s entire shareholdings.*)

On October 2, 2001, Air Comet and SEPI entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”),
through which Air Comet acquired SEPI’s 99.2% interest in Interinvest (which, in turn,
maintained the interests in the Argentine Airlines noted above).”

Air Comet paid a purchase price of US$1 for the interest in Interinvest.'? Under the SPA, Air
Comet agreed, in accordance with the industrial plan it created for the Argentine Airlines, to
assume the assets and liabilities of the Airlines, to retain airline employees for two years, to
make a US$50 million capital increase, to maintain its majority interest in the corporations, to
service specified flight routes, and to expand aircraft fleets.'' For its part, SEPI agreed to assume
the airlines’ liabilities up to US$300 million, and to assume commitments resulting from the
implementation of the industrial plan up to US$248 million.'* SEPI later agreed to contribute an
additional US$205 million to cover the operational losses suffered by the airlines between July
and October 2001.'°

In December 2002, ARSA and a majority of its creditors reached a settlement on debt
restructuring, which was subsequently approved by an Argentine commercial court, as well as a
court of appeals."

ii. Nature of the Dispute

Claimants allege that Respondent has unlawfully expropriated their investment in the Argentine
Airlines.'> Claimants characterize this expropriation as consisting of two parts. The “formal”
expropriation occurred when the Argentine Congress “purposefully and explicitly” enacted the
nationalization of the companies in December 2008.'° However, this formal expropriation was

® See Claimants’ letter of June 16, 2011 at 5. Since Teinver’s initial share purchase in 2006, the shareholding
structure of Air Comet has changed several times. On October 2, 2007, Teinver became Air Comet’s majority
shareholder, with the following distribution of shares: Teinver (56%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and Transportes de
Cereanias (22%). Id. Teinver purchased additional shares from Transportes de Cercanias on December 31, 2007,
with the following distribution of shares: Teinver (66.67%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and Transportes de
Cercanias (11.33%). Id. at 6. On February 8, 2008, Claimants’ respective participations shifted substantially:
Teinver (96.77%), Autobuses Urbanos (2.13%) and Transportes de Cercanias (1.1%). Id. at 6. This was the
ownership structure in place at the time that Claimants instituted this arbitration on December 11, 2008. During this
time, Air Comet has kept its shareholdings in Interinvest, which in turn has kept its shareholdings in ARSA and
AUSA. Id. at 5. On December 10, 2009, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos sold their remaining
shareholdings in Air Comet to Teinver, leaving Teinver as the sole shareholder of Air Comet. Id. at 6.

allegedly the culmination of a long process of “creeping” expropriation which started in October
2004 or earlier.'’ As such, according to Claimants, the dispute centers on two primary issues: (i)
a disagreement between the Parties as to the Argentine regulatory framework—regarding airfare
caps in particular—within which the Argentine Airlines were required to operate between 2002
and 2008, and (ii) disagreement between the Parties as to the remedy due to Claimants for the
expropriation of their shares in those airlines.'*

Il. Procedural Matters

a. Request for Arbitration and its Registration by ICSID

On December 11, 2008, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”
or “the Centre”) received a Request for Arbitration (“the Request”) against Respondent from
Claimants. The Request concerned the alleged nationalization of two commercial airlines, and
their subsidiaries, in which Claimants alleged having invested.

In the Request, Claimants invoked Argentina’s consent to dispute settlement through ICSID
arbitration provided in the Treaty, and, by way of an Most-Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause
contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty, in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the
United States of America and the Argentine Republic (the “U.S.-Argentina BIT”).

On December 17, 2008, ICSID, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Institution Rules”),
acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted a copy to the Argentine Republic and to the
Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.

On January 30, 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request and
notified the Parties thereof, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (“the ICSID Convention”) and
in accordance with Rules 6(1)(a) and 7(a) of the ICSID Institution Rules. The case was
registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1. On that same date, and in furtherance of Rules 7(c)
and (d) of the ICSID Institution Rules, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to communicate
any agreements reached regarding the number of arbitrators and the method for their
appointment, and to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.

b. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal

On April 3, 2009, Claimants requested that the Arbitral Tribunal be constituted in accordance
with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; that the Tribunal shall
consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the third, the President of the
Tribunal, be appointed by agreement of the Parties. On that same date, ICSID acknowledged
Claimants’ letter, and further advised the Parties that pursuant to Rule 3(1) of the ICSID Rules of

" Merits | 357.
OM 499.

Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Arbitration Rules”), either Party was to proceed
to name two persons, one as their party-appointed arbitrator, and the other for the position of the
President of the Tribunal. This first Party was to then invite the other Party to concur on the
proposal for the position of the President of the Tribunal, and to name its party-appointed
arbitrator.

On April 27, 2009, Claimants appointed Henri C. Alvarez, a Canadian national, as arbitrator.

On May 12, 2009, Claimants informed ICSID that Respondent had failed to appoint an arbitrator
and had made no proposals for the position of the President of the Tribunal, and in accordance
with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules requested
that the Chairman of the Administrative Council appoint the two arbitrators that had not been
appointed. The following day, ICSID informed Respondent that unless notification was received
by May 29, 2009 that it had appointed an arbitrator, and that the Parties had reached an
agreement on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal, then ICSID was to proceed to
make the appointments in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention,
ICSID Arbitration Rules and the normal procedures of the Centre.

On June 1, 2009, Respondent appointed Dr. Kamal Hossain, a Bangladeshi national, as
arbitrator.

Following some exchanges between the Parties and ICSID, the Parties were informed on
December 14, 2009, that ICSID was to propose to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative
Council the appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal, a United States national, as the President
of the Tribunal. The Parties were invited to provide observations to the proposed appointment
by December 21, 2009.

On December 21, 2009, both Parties informed ICSID that they did not have any observations on
the proposed appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal.

On December 28, 2009, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge
Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal.

By letter of January 4, 2010, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the
Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties and the arbitrators that the Tribunal was thus
constituted by (i) Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, QC (appointed by Claimants), (ii) Dr. Kamal Hossain
(appointed by Respondent), and (iii) Judge Thomas Buergenthal (appointed by ICSID pursuant
to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention). Further, the Tribunal was informed that Dr. Sergio
Puig, Counsel at ICSID, would serve as the Secretary to the Tribunal. He was subsequently
succeeded in this capacity by Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Counsel, ICSID.

c. Arbitral Procedure
The First Session of the Tribunal with the Parties was held on March 22, 2010, at the World

Bank’s Paris Conference Centre, at which the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal
had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID

Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and that they did not have any objections in this
respect.

During the session, the Parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters, and that
Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits would be filed by September 22, 2010. The Tribunal then
proposed two schedules for the written and oral pleadings in this case.

On April 16, 2010, both Parties confirmed their agreement with the schedule proposed.
Respondent, however, made a reservation to its agreement, noting that should the Tribunal
decide to bifurcate, then a specific schedule for the proceedings on jurisdiction should be
established.

On April 23, 2010, Respondent informed ICSID and the Tribunal of newspaper publications, in
which it was reported that the alleged majority shareholder of some of the Claimants had
transferred part of its ICSID claim to a U.S. investment fund in exchange for a contribution to
pay the costs arising in the proceedings. Respondent requested that the Tribunal require
Claimants to provide all available information regarding the matter and the content of the
agreement that was signed with said investment fund, and to also submit all related
documentation.

On May 28, 2010, Claimants filed their response stating that they had not sold their claim as
alleged by Respondent. Claimants stressed that they had no obligation to disclose any
agreements with third parties with respect to the funding of costs in this proceeding, and that
Respondent did not argue the necessity or relevance of its request. Claimants further argued that
due to Respondent’s conduct (alleged nationalization) and refusal to pay any compensation,
Claimants’ group of companies were in a distressed financial state, and thus had no choice but to
obtain external funding in order to afford the costs of the arbitration and pursue their claim
against Respondent. Claimants lastly noted that in any instance, this financing did not affect the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

The Parties were informed on June 16, 2010 that after careful consideration of their respective
positions on the matter of obtaining third-party funding, the Tribunal had decided not to grant
Respondent’s request at this early stage as it did not consider the currently available information
on record as sufficient. However, the Tribunal added that it did not preclude granting a similar
request in the future once the main pleadings had been filed.

On September 21, 2010, the Tribunal granted an extension of the deadline for the filing of
Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits until September 29, 2010, as agreed by the Parties, noting
that Respondent would then have a one-week extension of the deadline for the filing of its
subsequent submission.

On September 29, 2010, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits.

On December 6, 2010, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction, and Claimants’ Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction was subsequently filed on January 24, 2012.

On February 4, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.1, ruling that Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections would be dealt with as a preliminary question, and that the proceeding
on merits was accordingly suspended. The Tribunal also decided that a second round of
pleadings on jurisdiction would be filed, with Respondent to file their Reply on Jurisdiction by
March 7, 2011, and Claimants to file their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction within thirty (30) days of
their receipt of Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction. Additionally, the Tribunal proposed two
sets of dates for the hearing on jurisdiction.

On February 9, 2011, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of
documents. Subsequently, Claimants filed observations on the Respondent’s request on
February 14, 2011, and Respondent filed a response on February 21, 2011.

On February 24, 2011, the Parties were invited to consult in regard to the schedule for the
forthcoming hearing, and to submit an agreed proposal by April 25, 2011.

On February 28, 2011, Claimants filed a reply on Respondent’s request for production of
documents.

On March 1, 2011, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal, after careful and due
deliberation, had decided not to grant Respondent’s Request for the Production of Documents at
this jurisdictional stage. It was added, however, that the Tribunal did not preclude a similar
request at a later stage.

On March 10, 2011, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction.

On April 12, 2011, Claimants filed a request for provisional measures, asserting that Respondent
had initiated measures to collect taxes that would result in Respondent’s effective acquisition of
title to Claimants’ Argentine holding company, Interinvest S.A. (“Interinvest”), and was thus
requesting that the Tribunal order Respondent to halt any court or administrative collection
proceedings against this company. Specifically, Claimants sought an interim order directing
Respondent to withdraw or otherwise cease and desist from enforcing the tax-related payment
orders that it had issued until the Tribunal rendered its award. They also requested that the
Tribunal issue an immediate order preserving the status quo ante until such time as it ruled on
this application for provisional measures. Claimants further requested that the Tribunal issue an
emergency, temporary order prohibiting Respondent from enforcing the existing tax payment
orders or from issuing any new ones.

On April 13, 2011, the Tribunal fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties’
submissions on Claimants’ request for the Tribunal to decide on provisional measures.

On April 20, 2011, Respondent submitted its observations on Claimants’ request for an
emergency, temporary order, stating that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules
made provision for the issuing of emergency, temporary orders, and that in any case, the absence
of urgency was manifest in this instance. As such, Respondent requested that the Tribunal reject
the request, and in addition reserved its rights and the State’s power to levy taxes and to enforce

such rights through such channels and in such courts, tribunals and otherwise as may be
appropriate.

On April 26, 2011, Respondent requested an extension of the deadline that had been set out
during the first session for the filing of new documents.

After consulting with the Parties, on April 27, 2011, the Tribunal extended the deadline for the
Parties to submit new documents; fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties’
subsequent submissions on Claimants’ requests for provisional measures; and invited the Parties
to confer and to reach agreement on the structure, schedule and other matters regarding the
hearing.

Also on April 27, 2011, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.

On April 29, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, denying Claimants’ request for
an emergency, temporary order, noting that the Parties would be able to fully present their
arguments in such regard during the hearing on jurisdiction. The Parties were further invited to
refrain from aggravating or extending the dispute.

On the same date, Claimants renewed their request for an emergency, temporary order, in light of
the fact that Interinvest had been served with a notice for immediate payment of taxes.
Respondent was invited to comment on Claimants’ request by May 4, 2011.

Also on April 29, 2011, Respondent filed observations on Claimants’ request for provisional
measures of April 12, 2011. Claimants filed a response on May 4, 2011.

On May 6, 2011, Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Parties’ agreement concerning the
organization of the hearing on jurisdiction, which was later confirmed by the Respondent. On
the same date, Claimants filed their Reply on their Request for Provisional Measures.

On May 13, 2011, the Parties were informed that further to their exchanges on the matter of
Claimants’ request for an emergency temporary order of April 29, 2011, the Tribunal had
determined that in view of the proximity of the hearing, there was no imminent or sufficiently
imminent threat until the hearing, and as such Claimants’ request was denied.

Also on May 13, 2011, Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Provisional Measures.

On May 27-31, 2011, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction and Provisional Measures at the
seat of the Centre in Washington D.C.

On June 8, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, posing questions to the Parties
after the hearing.

The Parties filed their answers to the questions posed by the Tribunal in accordance with the
procedural calendar that was set forth in Procedural Order No. 3, and on July 5, 2011, Claimants
made a further submission to complement their answers.

On August 26, 2011, Ms. Annalise Nelson was appointed Assistant to the President of the
Tribunal with the agreement of the Parties.

On August 30, 2011, Claimants filed a letter concerning the conclusion of the reorganization
proceedings of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. in Argentina and addressing recent case law,
including the recent Decision on Admissibility and Jurisdiction in Abaclat and others v.
Argentina’, and the Order Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Annulment Proceeding in
ATA v. Jordan.”°

On October 26, 2011, Respondent filed a letter in response to Claimants’ letter of August 30,
2011, and adjoining the expert report of Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez.

On November 8, 2011, Claimants filed a letter in response to Respondent’s letter of October 26,
2011. In their letter, Claimants characterized portions of Respondent’s letter as rearguing out-of-
time its jurisdictional objection arising out of Claimants’ alleged lack of jus standi. Claimants
requested the Tribunal to strike Argentina’s belated arguments and disregard the new expert
report from Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez. Claimants also noted recent case law,
including the Impregilo v. Argentina award’! and the Decision on Jurisdiction in Hochtief.

On December 15, 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties, that it had taken note of the arguments
made in Respondent’s October 26, 2011 letter and Claimants’ November 8, 2011 letter as they
relate to the pleadings on jurisdiction, with the exception of the expert report of the Spanish
attorney, Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez, attached to Respondent’s letter, and
Respondent’s arguments based thereon.

Also on December 15, 2011, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to file certain
dissenting opinions in recent case law. The Tribunal granted Respondent’s request on December
20, 2011.

On December 22, 2011, Respondent filed a letter attaching the above-mentioned dissenting
opinions, including those of (i) Professor Brigitte Stern in Impregilo; (ii) Mr. Chris Thomas in
Hochtief; and (iii) Professor Georges Abi-Saab in Abaclat.

On February 17, 2012, Respondent filed a letter requesting leave from the Tribunal to introduce
into the record the recently adopted decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the

' Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic (case formerly known as Giovanna a Beccara and others) (ICSID Case

District of Columbia Circuit in Republic of Argentina v. BG Group ple of January 17, 2012,73
and of the arbitral tribunal in the UNCITRAL case, ICS v. Argentine Republic.**

On February 22, 2012, the Tribunal accepted Respondent’s letter of February 17, 2012, and
provided Claimants with the opportunity to respond to this letter.

On February 28, 2012, Claimants filed a letter in response to Respondent’s letter of February 17,
2012.

On March 26, 2012, Claimants filed a second request for provisional measures, alleging that
Respondent had taken unlawful actions on March 14, 2012 that irreparably threaten to harm
Claimants’ investment and the rights Claimants seek to protect in this arbitration. Specifically,
Claimants asserted that Respondent, acting through the Boards of Directors of the Argentine
Airlines and their related service companies, which Respondent now controls, announced that
they would submit Amended Financial Statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008
for approval at upcoming Shareholders’ Meetings. According to Claimants, the amended 2008
financial statements would also amend previously-approved and final financial statements for the
fiscal years ending in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.7

In their second request for provisional measures, Claimants sought an interim order directing
Respondent to stop any procedures aimed at approving any formal or material changes to the
financial statements of the Argentine Airlines for any year prior to 2008; to stop any procedures
aimed at approving the 2008 Amended Financial Statements; to make available to Claimants’
representatives in Interinvest, in their capacity as shareholders of the Argentine Airlines, all
information available and subject to discussion and vote in any shareholders’ meeting(s) to be
scheduled in this respect; and to authorize Claimants’ representatives in Interinvest to attend,
participate and/or exercise their voting rights in any shareholders’ meeting(s) to be scheduled in
connection with the alleged “adjustments” to the Argentine Airlines financial statements, and in
all cases free of any coercion, or physical or legal threat, until the Tribunal renders its Award.?°
Claimants also requested that the Tribunal issue an emergency temporary order preserving the
status quo ante with respect to the financial statements until such time as it ruled on this
application for provisional measures.

Also on March 26, 2012, Respondent filed a letter, with attachments, informing the Tribunal of
“some new developments of a serious nature” that had unfolded in criminal proceedings in
Spain.

On March 28, 2012, the Tribunal fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties’
submissions on Claimants’ second request for the Tribunal to decide on provisional measures
and for Claimants’ response to Respondent’s letter regarding the Spanish criminal proceedings.

On April 1, 2012, and following correspondence from the Parties, the Tribunal amended the
procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties’ submissions on Claimants’ second request for
provisional measures. The Tribunal directed the Parties to take no actions or steps to aggravate
the dispute or to render Claimants’ application moot pending the Tribunal’s consideration of it.

On April 4, 2012, Claimants filed a response to Respondent’s March 26, 2012 letter concerning
the “new developments” in the Spanish criminal proceedings.

On April 11, 2012, Respondent filed observations on Claimants’ second request for provisional
measures.

On April 23, 2012, Claimants filed observations in reply to their second request for provisional
measures.

On May 4, 2012, Respondent filed observations in rejoinder on Claimants’ second request for
provisional measures.

On May 24, 2012, Respondent filed further observations concerning Claimants’ second request
for provisional measures and Respondent's fourth objection on jurisdiction. On May 25, 2012,
the Tribunal invited Claimants to file a response to Respondent's submission by June 1, 2012. On
June 1, 2012, Claimants filed a response to Respondent’s submission of May 24, 2012

On September 28, 2012, Respondent directed the Tribunal’s attention to (i) the award rendered
on August 22, 2012 in Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No.
ARB/05/1); (ii) the decision rendered by a Swedish court on November 9, 2012 concerning the
award rendered on October 1, 2007 in the case RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,
SCC Case No. V079/2005; and (iii) to a recent submission before the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in the case of Thai-Lao Lignite (Thailand) Co., Ltd & Hongsa
Lignite (Lao PDR) Co., Ltd v. Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. By letter
of October 9, 2012, Claimants, upon invitation from the Tribunal, provided their comments on
Respondent’s submission of September 28, 2012.

Ill. Position of the Parties on Jurisdiction

a. Respondent’s position

In its written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, Respondent argues the following:

i. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants failed to meet the requirements
set forth in Article X of the Treaty;

ii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants have no legal standing to claim
for legal rights that belong to another legal person;

73.

iii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate certain of Claimants’ allegations that
concern the acts of non-state entities, which cannot be attributed to Respondent;
and

iv. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investment invoked by Claimants is
not an investment protected by the Treaty.

The Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare, pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, that the Centre has no jurisdiction and that the Tribunal has no competence

over this case and, therefore, to dismiss the claim, ordering costs and fees against Claimants, plus
interest, pursuant to Rule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules.

b. Claimants’ position

In their written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, Claimants argue the following:

The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims because Claimants have
satisfied the procedural provisions of the Australia-Argentina BIT, which they
may rely on through the application of the Treaty’s MFN clause;

The Tribunal has jurisdiction, in the alternative, because Claimants have satisfied

and/or are excused for reasons of futility from the requirements set forth in Article

X of the Treaty;

iii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims because Claimants are
legitimate parties to this arbitration;

iv. The Tribunal should defer questions of state attribution for acts of non-state
entities to the merits phase of this arbitration or, in the alternative, determine that
the acts alleged are attributable to Respondent; and

v. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims because Claimants’

investment was acquired and effected in accordance with the legislation of

Argentina and in good faith.

Claimants request the following relief: i) a declaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction
of the ICSID Convention and within the competence of this Tribunal; ii) an order dismissing all
of Respondent’s objections to the admissibility of the dispute and dismissing all of Respondent’s
objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal; and iii) an order
that Argentina pay the costs for these proceedings,”* including the Tribunal’s fees and expenses,
and the costs of Claimants’ representation, subject to interest until the day of payment.”

IV. Analysis

a. First Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants’ Fulfillment of the Procedural
Requirements of Article X of the Treaty

Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection to this dispute is rooted in Article X of the Treaty,
which provides that

1. Disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in
connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement shall, as far as
possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.

2. If a dispute within the meaning of section 1 cannot be settled within six months
as from the date on which one of the parties to the dispute raised it, it shall be
submitted, at the request of either party, to the competent tribunals of the Party in
whose territory the investment was made.

3. The dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal in any of the
following circumstances:

(a) At the request of one of the parties to the dispute, when no decision has been
reached on the merits after a period of 18 months has elapsed as from the moment
the judicial proceeding provided for in section 2 of this article was initiated or

When such a decision has been reached, but the dispute between the parties
persists;

(b) When both parties to the dispute have so agreed.

According to Respondent, Claimants have failed to meet the requirements of Article X.
Specifically, Respondent alleges that Claimants have not attempted to amicably settle their
dispute in accordance with Article X(1) and (2) of the Treaty. Respondent also alleges that
Claimants have not subjected their dispute to the Argentine courts for a period of eighteen
months before seeking this arbitration, in accordance with Article X(3).

The Claimants have made two responses to this objection. First, Claimants assert that they are
entitled to invoke the Treaty’s MFN clause in Article IV(2) in order to benefit from the more
favorable dispute settlement provisions of other BITs negotiated by Argentina. Second,
Claimants assert that even if the Treaty’s MFN clause does not permit them to borrow the
dispute settlement provisions from other Argentine BITs, they have satisfied the requirements of
Article X of the Treaty, or, in the alternative, that they should be excused from Article X’s
requirements for reasons of futility.

As the Parties’ submissions concern two distinct arguments in the alternative, the Tribunal will
address each of them in turn. The Tribunal will first address the issue of Claimants’ compliance

82.

with the requirements of Article X of the Treaty. The Tribunal will then assess, on an alternative
basis, the issue of the applicability of the MFN clause to Article X of the Treaty.

i. Compliance with the Requirements of Article X
1. Position of Respondent

6-month requirement

Respondent argues that Claimants resorted to the jurisdiction of ICSID without first conducting
amicable negotiations for at least six months with the Argentine Republic, even though the
fulfillment of this requirement is one of the conditions upon which Respondent’s consent to
ICSID arbitration is based.*°

Under Article X(1) and (2) of the Treaty, disputes “shall, if possible, be amicably settled” within
a term of six months.*' Article X(2) provides that the 6-month negotiation period must be
counted from the date of submission of such dispute by either party.*” According to Respondent,
the period starts to run once a party claims that there is disagreement about the facts and rights
related to the Treaty, not when the Treaty is breached.*?

Respondent asserts, moreover, that investors must give formal notice of the dispute to
Respondent’s competent authorities, in order for the government to be aware of the dispute.
This notice should describe the nature of the dispute and express the intent to commence
amicable negotiations for the purpose of resolving the conflict within the framework of the
Treaty.

Respondent contends that Claimants failed to give notice to the Argentine authorities of the
formal commencement of amicable negotiations and that these negotiations never actually took
place.** It was only on November 20, 2008 that Claimants notified Respondent of the filing of
their claim under the Treaty, when they sent a letter informing Respondent that Claimants had
decided to submit an investment dispute under the Treaty.*”

Respondent further submits that none of the documents submitted by Claimants as proof of
negotiations mention the rights provided for in the Treaty, international arbitration proceedings,
or even the Treaty’s requirement to hold amicable negotiations for a term of six months.

Although Claimants reference meetings with Argentine officials, nothing demonstrates that those
discussions were held within the context of Article X(1). To the contrary, those meetings

concerned the local legal framework applicable to Argentina’s commercial air transportation
: 39
industry.

Respondent notes that Claimants have submitted purported evidence, including newspaper
articles and statements by Argentine senators and congressmen, that Respondent was aware that
Claimants would resort to ICSID proceedings, but Respondent argues that this evidence is
irrelevant.” Respondent’s objection is based on Claimants’ failure to meet the 6-month
amicable settlement requirement.*' Claimants’ obligation under Article X(1) and (2) is not
fulfilled by media discussions regarding the possibility of resorting to ICSID in the event that
negotiations are unsuccessful.” Likewise, the statements made by Respondent’s congressmen
and senators regarding Claimants’ possible resort to ICSID do not constitute negotiations; such
statements are speculative and do not express the will of the National Congress or the
Respondent.?

18-month local court requirement

According to Respondent, the language of Article X(2) and (3) of the Treaty requires that
disputes must first be submitted to the domestic courts of competent jurisdiction before they can
be submitted to international arbitration. This language is mandatory, and the prior submission
of disputes to the local courts is a jurisdictional requirement which may not be set aside or
disregarded.**

Respondent disputes Claimants’ assertion that they have met this requirement, based on an
expropriation suit that was filed by the Argentine Republic against Interinvest in the Argentine
courts. According to Respondent, the expropriation lawsuit under Argentine law and the present
arbitration are clearly different, as they do not involve the same parties or subject matter."* The
purpose of the expropriation lawsuit is for the domestic court to determine the value of the
property expropriated by Argentina, while the subject of the arbitration is not only expropriation
but also allegations of unfair treatment, arbitrary measures, and failure to grant full protection
and security, which are all governed by the Treaty.

Respondent further argues that the Request for Arbitration filed with ICSID should have been
submitted only after the dispute had been submitted to the local courts for 18 months. However,
the expropriation suit commenced on February 5, 2009, while the Request for Arbitration was
filed by Claimants earlier, on December 11, 2008.8

Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants’ assertion that they have satisfied the 18-month court
requirement contradicts their invocation, through the Treaty’s MFN clause, of the Argentina-
U.S. or Argentina-Australia BITs. Both of the latter BITs establish that disputes may only be
submitted to international arbitration if they have not been submitted to the local courts.”

Futility

Respondent argues that Claimants are not entitled to an excuse from the requirements of Article
X by reason of futility. Argentine law guarantees the judicial protection of the rights at issue,
and Claimants did not encounter any obstacles in the filing of judicial claims. The Argentine
courts routinely adopt final and provisional decisions in less than eighteen months, in both
ordinary and expedited summary proceedings.” Moreover, there is no basis for Claimants to
assert that they would be required to incur disproportionate court costs in pursuing a remedy
before the Argentine courts, and there is no basis on which to conclude that the Argentine courts
lack independence.*!

2. Position of Claimants

6-month requirement

Claimants assert that they have complied with the 6-month period in the Treaty, as they
submitted their request for arbitration well after six months had elapsed from the time Argentina
“instigated” the dispute.*> By December 11, 2008, the Parties had gone through more than a year
of intense negotiations and no fewer than three attempted settlement agreements.”

Claimants assert that Article X requires neither a formal notice nor express allegations of Treaty
breaches. The first part of Article X(1) of the Treaty broadly defines the term “disputes” as
“{d]isputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with
investments within the meaning of this Agreement.” This broad definition of disputes does not
refer to the legal basis of such disputes nor does it require that any settlement negotiations be
formally held under the Treaty or address or allege breaches of specific Treaty provisions. It
requires only that the dispute be related to an investment.**

According to Claimants, Article X(1) provides a “best-efforts” clause to attempt to settle the
dispute, and Article X(2) provides a “cooling-off’ period whereby either party can proceed to the
next stage as soon as six months have passed since the instigation or initiation of the dispute
itself.°> The sole condition for proceeding from amicable settlement attempts to the next step is
that the dispute “cannot be settled within six months from the date on which one of the parties to
the dispute instigated it.”*°

Claimants assert that the Treaty’s 6-month cooling off period starts to run as of the date on which
one of the parties to the dispute “instigated” (“promovid”) the dispute.”’ This “instigation” of a
dispute refers to the act or omission actually triggering the dispute. Thus, the 6-month period
starts to run not when a formal breach of the treaty is alleged, raised or communicated, but rather
when the disputed conduct occurs.**

Claimants note that while other treaties to which one of the Parties is a signatory may explicitly
require a notification of the dispute under the BIT before the 6-month period can began to run,
no such requirement is included in Article X of the Treaty.” Furthermore, under Article X, there
is no requirement that a claimant raise formal or explicit allegations of the Treaty breach.
Considering that the dispute is to be submitted first to local tribunals and only thereafter to
international arbitration, Article X cannot reasonably be construed to require that formal treaty
allegations be made for the “dispute” to exist.°' Furthermore, international jurisprudence holds
that it is not necessary for a State to expressly refer to a specific treaty in its exchanges with the
other State—what matters is that the exchanges “refer to the subject-matter of the treaty.”

Claimants assert that, as a matter of fact, Respondent “instigated” this dispute as early as October
2002, after it failed to implement promised relief measures for the Argentine Airlines.°
Alternatively, Claimants assert that the “dispute” began in October 2004, when Respondent
rejected Claimants’ request for an airfare increase. The dispute intensified in 2005 and 2006,
and, after lengthy negotiations, Respondent again promised relief measures. However, by
approving an insufficient airfare increase and failing to provide promised subsidies, Respondent
again breached its agreement with Claimants.

According to Claimants, the dispute continued in April 2008, when Claimants requested
Respondent to take urgent action to correct governmental measures impacting its operations,
including the approval of airfare increases or subsidies. In May 2008, Respondent, Interinvest
and the Argentine Airlines concluded an agreement to change the Airlines’ corporate structure,
increasing Respondent’s interest and granting a controlling interest to a prospective private
Argentine investor. As part of this agreement, Respondent agreed to raise domestic fares and
grant relief measures. However, Respondent failed to do so, and the deal with the prospective
investor ultimately fell through.”

On July 17, 2008, the Parties reached an agreement regarding the sale of the Argentine Airlines
to Respondent. Under the agreement, the Parties agreed that the purchase price would be

determined by independent appraisers appointed by each Party and that, if there were still a
disagreement on the price, the Parties would appoint a third independent appraiser.®* According
to Claimants, however, Respondent continued the dispute on July 24, 2008, when it submitted a
bill to Congress for the “repossession” of the Argentine Airlines. In doing so, Claimants allege,
Respondent breached the July 17, 2008 Agreement. On September 18, 2008, the Argentine
Congress passed a law approving Respondent’s repossession of the Argentine Airlines.
However, Congress determined that the amount of compensation would be calculated
exclusively by the Argentine Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Nacion, in disregard of the third-party
valuation mechanism set out in the July 2008 Agreement, thus further entrenching the dispute.”

Finally, Claimants assert that even if this Tribunal required the “dispute” between the Parties to
concern the Treaty, Claimants have met this requirement. Respondent was aware that, if the
ongoing negotiations failed, Claimants could submit an ICSID complaint. The dispute between
Claimants and Respondent was a national event and was extensively discussed in the Argentine
press starting in early 2008.” During a Congressional debate in August 2008, various
congressmen acknowledged that Claimants were preparing their ICSID arbitration under the
Treaty. Moreover, during a September 1, 2008 Congressional hearing, Claimants’
representatives confirmed they would resort to international arbitration if Respondent failed to
pay fair compensation.”

Therefore, according to Claimants, even if a “dispute” did not exist between the Parties between
2002 and 2007, the evidence demonstrates that the current dispute in connection with Claimants’
investments had been instigated, raised and formally discussed by May 2008. The evidence also
demonstrates that the Parties had attempted to solve this dispute amicably through several
negotiations that lasted more than six months, including the negotiations that surrounded the
May 15, 2008 Agreement and the July 17, 2008 Agreement.”*

18-month local court requirement

According to Claimants, the 18-month local court requirement of Article X(3) has been satisfied,
because Argentine tribunals have had the opportunity to undo the measures giving rise to this
dispute for more than eighteen months, and yet have failed to do so.” Claimants cite to multiple
actions brought before the Argentine courts. First, the Tribunal de Tasaciones, in two different
valuations, in October 2008 and in January 2009, found that the Argentine Airlines were worth
approximately negative US$832 million and negative US$770 million.’> Second, following
Interinvest’s rejection of the January 2009 valuation, Respondent initiated a lawsuit in an
Argentine court seeking the expropriation of the shares of the Argentine Airlines. That court has
not yet issued a substantive decision in the case.”°

Claimants acknowledge that both the Tribunal de Tasaciones’ valuation and the expropriation
lawsuit initiated by the GOA are based exclusively on Argentine law. However, these suits
relate to the same subject matter now before this Tribunal: the question of compensation for
Respondent’s take-over of Claimants’ investments.

Claimants also acknowledge that the 18-month period had not lapsed when they requested
arbitration on December 11, 2008. However, at present, Respondent’s expropriation lawsuit has
been before Argentine tribunals for well over 18 months without resulting in any substantive
decision.”* Claimants assert, as a result, that (i) Argentine courts have had more than 18 months
to decide the main issues in this dispute and that (ii) the core purpose of the local court
requirement—to give the host State the opportunity to consider and/or remedy the disputed
measures before they are brought to international arbitration—has been satisfied.” International
Jurisprudence supports the position that under these circumstances, such preconditions have been
met.

Finally, Claimants assert that their satisfaction of the 18-month local court requirement of Article
X(3) does not contradict the dispute settlement provisions of the U.S.-Argentina BIT.*' The
U.S.-Argentina “fork in the road” clause requires the investor to choose either a local court
remedy or international arbitration. However, here, it was Respondent, and not Claimants, who
initiated the local expropriation suit. According to Claimants, this position is fully in
accordance with Article X(2) of the Treaty, which makes clear that the proceedings before local
tribunals may be submitted “at the request of either party.”**

Futility

Claimants submit that even if this Tribunal were to determine that the requirements of Article X
have not been met, it would be futile to require Claimants to make further attempts at amicable
settlement or to require Claimants to resubmit the dispute to the Argentine courts for an
additional 18 months.

According to Claimants, they have attempted to amicably settle the present dispute on several
occasions from September 2002 onwards, and with even greater focus as of May 2008. In
addition to these negotiations, Claimants have also held additional negotiations with Argentina,
from October 2008 until early 2010, specifically concerning the compensation due to Claimants
for the expropriation of their investment.*°

Claimants also argue that requiring them to resubmit the dispute once they have satisfied the 18-
month local court requirement would serve no purpose whatsoever and would only add cost and
time to the proceedings.*” Furthermore, the fact that the core matter of the dispute has already
been pending for more than 18 months demonstrates that it would be futile to now require
Claimants to litigate for an additional 18 months.** Jurisprudence supports the view that when a
requirement to resort to local courts would be futile, ineffective and/or would not provide the
claimant with appropriate means of legal redress, that requirement should be waived.”

Claimants argue that in any event, the failure to comply with the 6- and 18-month waiting
periods is not a bar to jurisdiction. According to Claimants, the majority of ICSID tribunals
addressing this issue have found that such waiting periods constitute procedural, rather than
jurisdictional, requirements.”°

3. Analysis of the Tribunal
(a) The Requirements of X(1) and X(2)
Article X(1) and (2) reads as follows:

1. Disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection
with investments within the meaning of this Agreement shall, as far as possible,
be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.

2. Ifa dispute within the meaning of section 1 cannot be settled within six months as
from the date on which one of the parties to the dispute raised it, it shall be
submitted, at the request of either party, to the competent tribunals of the Party in
whose territory the investment was made. [Si una controversia en el sentido del
parrafo I no pudiera ser dirimida dentro del plazo de seis meses, contando desde
la fecha en que una de las partes en la controversia la haya promovido, sera
sometida a peticién de una de ellas a los tribunales competentes de la Parte en
cuyo territorio se realizé la inversion. ]

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that Article X(1) can fairly be interpreted as a general “best
efforts” obligation for the parties to attempt to amicably settle their dispute. However, it would
be an overly literal interpretation of Article X(2)’s “cannot be settled within six months”
language to read it as simply requiring that the Parties wait for six months after the dispute began
before they proceed to the next step in the dispute settlement process. The natural reading of
Articles X(1) and (2) together is that the Parties are obligated to make their best efforts to
amicably settle their dispute, and that they are required to do so for six months before proceeding
to the next step.

i. The Commencement of the 6-Month Period

109. Claimants assert that the relevant moment for Article X(2) is the date on which Respondent’s

substantive conduct that is in dispute takes place.”' In other words, the key inquiry is when the
act or omission that triggered the dispute occurred. To reach this conclusion, Claimants point to
the use of the word “promover” in the Spanish language original of Article X(2), the relevant
portion of which reads “contando desde la fecha en que una de las partes en la controversia la
haya promovido.” They translate “promover” as “initiate,” “provoke,” “give rise to,” “cause,”
and “instigate.” From this, Claimants conclude that “promover una controversia” refers to the
“substantive conduct, acts or omissions” committed by Respondent that are at the origin of this
dispute.”? Claimants note that “promover” is different from the verbs used in the dispute
resolution preconditions of other BITs, which instead require the parties to “someter” a dispute

or define the date that a dispute “surgid.

Claimants’ interpretation does not ascribe a natural or ordinary meaning to the phrase “promover
una controversia” or “instigate a dispute.” Claimants’ argument focuses almost exclusively on
the word “promover,” while largely ignoring the meaning or importance of the word “dispute.”
While “instigate” or “initiate” or “provoke” all suggest the commencement of something, that
something in question is the dispute itself, not the acts giving rise to the dispute. Both “dispute”
and “controversia” are synonyms for “argument” or “disagreement.” As stated by the PCIJ in
Mavrommatis, “[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or
of interests between two persons.””” To instigate a dispute, therefore, refers to the time at which
the disagreement was formed, which can only occur once there has been at least some exchange
of views by the parties. It does not refer to the commission of the act that caused the parties to
disagree, for the very simple reason a breach or violation does not become a “dispute” until the
injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.

Claimants assert that their interpretation is not unprecedented and that other investment treaties
have similar provisions. However, the only provision Claimants have identified is NAFTA
Article 1120, which has starkly different language from Article X(2).°° NAFTA Article 1120
includes the clause “provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to a
Claim.” But Article X(2) makes no mention of “the events giving rise to the claim,” and it
would be a stretch to read such a phrase into the plain meaning of “promover una controversia.”
Furthermore, to the extent that the purpose of the 6-month requirement is to grant the host state
the opportunity to redress the problem before the investor submits the dispute to arbitration,
measuring from the date that the breach occurred would not further this policy goal.°” Without

some exchange of views, Respondent could have no idea that an investor believed it to be in
breach.

ii. The Requirement of Formal Notification

The ordinary meaning of Article X(1) supports Claimants’ argument that they were not required
to give formal notice in order to commence settlement negotiations. Article X(1) simply defines
“disputes” as “arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with
investments within the meaning of this Agreement.” There is nothing in this language that
suggests that Claimants must formally notify Respondent that there is a dispute under the Treaty
or identify the specific provisions of the Treaty that are the basis of the dispute. All that is
required for a dispute to exist under Article X(1) is that it be “in connection with investments.”
In this regard, Claimants’ citation of Vivendi I is on point.°* Vivendi I concerned the France-
Argentina BIT, which contained an article with a similar definition of disputes as “relating to
investments made under this Agreement.” The tribunal concluded that this article “does not use
a narrower formulation, requiring that the investor’s claim allege a breach of the BIT itself.
Read literally, the requirements for arbitral jurisdiction in Article 8 do not necessitate that the
Claimant allege a breach of the BIT itself: it is sufficient that the dispute relate to an investment
made under the BIT.””

Claimants correctly point out that other BITs expressly define “dispute” with reference to the
dispute’s legal basis under those BITs. For example, the U.S.-Ecuador BIT describes disputes as
follows:

For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party
and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to: (a) an
investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an
investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to
such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or
created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.'”

The U.S.-Ecuador BIT was addressed by the tribunals in Murphy'®! and Burlington,' which
determined that a dispute does not exist, and settlement of this dispute cannot be attempted, until
it has been articulated in terms of a treaty breach. Specifically, the tribunal in Murphy held that
the claimants were required to inform the respondent of their intention to hold talks for purposes
of settling their claim under the BIT.'® However, both Murphy and Burlington are

 

 

This from the purpose of the waiting period, which is to allow the parties to enter into good-faith negotiations
before initiating the arbitration.”).

distinguishable based on the language of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, and both tribunals make clear
that their determination is predicated on the treaty’s definition of “dispute.”!*

International jurisprudence also supports the general proposition that there is no requirement that
a party formally notify the other party that negotiations are occurring under a particular treaty, in
order for negotiations to be occurring with respect to a dispute. As the International Court of
Justice (“ICS”) has stated:

[I]t does not necessarily follow that, because a State has not expressly referred in
negotiations with another State to a particular treaty as having been violated by
conduct of that other State, it is debarred from invoking a compromissory clause
in that treaty. The United States was well aware that Nicaragua alleged that its
conduct was a breach of international obligations before the present case was
instituted; and it is now aware that specific articles of the 1956 Treaty are alleged
to have been violated. It would make no sense to require Nicaragua now to
institute fresh proceedings based on the Treaty, which it would be fully entitled to
do.

Because Article X and international jurisprudence are clear that, under these circumstances,
Claimants were not obligated to initiate formal negotiations under the Treaty or to notify
Respondent of their possible resort to ICSID arbitration under the Treaty, the Parties’
voluminous materials regarding discussions in the Argentine media and within the Argentine
Senate regarding the possibility of recourse to ICSID arbitration are not relevant.

iii. Determining When the Dispute Began

Considering that a formal notification of the existence of the dispute or the start of the
negotiation period was not required, the issue for the Tribunal is to identify when the “dispute”
can be considered to have begun. Considering that the Request for Arbitration was brought on
December 11, 2008, the critical date is therefore June 11, 2008, six months earlier.

It is clear from the voluminous briefing on this subject that the two sides have had differing
views on the regulation and control of the Argentine Airlines for years, and that the Parties have
had numerous communications and exchanges, that have included the highest levels of the
Argentine government.'° However, the disagreements during this period have been dynamic,
and Claimants’ arguments reflect this. Claimants have identified two “core issues” to their
dispute: 1) a disagreement over the regulatory framework that was applied to Claimants

1 See Burlington v. Ecuador, Decision on Jurisdiction at $f] 335-337 (“[T]he “dispute” to which Article V1(3)(a)
refers is one that relates to “an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an
investment.” Stated otherwise, as long as no allegation of Treaty breach is made, no dispute will have arisen giving
access to arbitration under Article VI.”); see also Murphy v. Ecuador, Decision on Jurisdiction, at {| 103.

(regarding the airfare caps imposed upon the Argentine Airlines) and 2) a disagreement over the
compensation owed to Claimants for the expropriation of their investment (through
Respondent’s direct expropriation of Interinvest’s shares).'°’ The first issue, an alleged
“creeping expropriation” of the Argentine Airlines, purportedly began in 2004.'* The second
issue, the alleged direct expropriation of Jnterinvest’s shares in the Argentine Airlines, began
much later.

International courts and tribunals agree that for a dispute to exist, it must have crystallized into
an actual disagreement. As the ICJ held in Mavrommatis, “A dispute is a disagreement on a
point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.” It must be
shown that “the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other.”!'° As the Maffezini
tribunal recognized, the dispute “must relate to clearly identified issues between the parties and
must not be merely academic...The dispute must go beyond general grievances and must be
susceptible of being stated in terms of a concrete claim.”"!' A diplomatic request by an investor
to a host State for further assistance does not, on its own, necessarily express disagreement on
the parties’ rights and obligations.''? Instead, only when a request “manifest[s] a disagreement
over the rights and obligations” can it be considered a dispute.''

It is clear that a disagreement between the Parties regarding the regulatory treatment of the
Argentine Airlines had developed long before the June 11, 2008 critical date, and that the Parties
had conducted substantial negotiations regarding this disagreement. Claimants assert that a
dispute has existed in this case since late 2004, when the Respondent rejected the Argentine
Airlines’ request for an increase in airfare caps.''* This dispute allegedly escalated in 2006
when, despite prior promises to increase the airfare caps, Respondent now conditioned this and
other measures on Claimants’ transfer of a percentage of their shares in ARSA.'!> It is true that
many of the discussions between the Parties took the form of a request from Claimants for
various promised regulatory changes. However, a 2004 letter from the Argentine Airlines to
Respondent makes clear their position that Respondent has failed to properly apply its

regulations.''* This demonstrates that Claimants plainly disagree with Respondent over the

application of Argentine laws and regulations to them.

It is less clear that a disagreement between the Parties regarding the expropriation of
Interinvest’s shares existed before June 11, 2008. While Claimants assert that they disagreed
with Respondent over the fair valuation of their investment by April 2008,'"” the evidence on this
is not so clear. At that point, Respondent’s first attempt to find a buyer for the Argentine
Airlines had failed, because Claimants had rejected the potential buyer’s purchase offer.''*
However, it seems difficult to characterize Claimants’ rejection of a third party’s purchase offer
as a legal dispute with Respondent, rather than simply a failed business transaction. The Parties
subsequently executed an agreement providing for Respondent to buy the shares of the Argentine
Airlines on July 17, 2008. While Claimants argue that the negotiating environment of this
agreement was hostile and threatening,''’ it is conceptually difficult to view an executed
agreement as constituting a legal dispute.'”°

The issue, therefore, is whether it is enough for purposes of Article X(2) that by June 11, 2008, a
disagreement existed concerning the regulatory treatment of the Argentine Airlines (and was
being negotiated), even if a clear disagreement regarding the valuation of Interinvest’s
(ultimately expropriated) shares in the Argentine Airlines had not yet crystallized. In other
words, are these two disagreements sufficiently related that negotiations under the first
disagreement are enough to satisfy Article X(2)?

The answer to this question is yes. International jurisprudence suggests that the subject matter of
the negotiations should be the same as the dispute that is brought before the court or tribunal. In
the recent Georgia v. Russia case, the ICJ noted that “the exchanges must refer to the subject-
matter of the treaty with sufficient clarity to enable the State against which a claim is made to
identify that there is, or may be, a dispute with regard to that subject-matter.”'?! The tribunal in
CMS, describing the existence of multiple types of sovereign actions that could constitute
disputes, noted that “as long as [these multiple different actions] affect the investor in violation
of its rights and cover the same subject matter, the fact that they may originate from different

"6 See, e.g., Merits | 124, citing an October 4, 2004 letter from the Argentine Airlines to the Argentine Secretary of
Transportation, Mr. Ricardo Jaime, in which they request an increase in the airfare caps. In this letter, the Argentine
Airlines assert that the current airfare caps imposed on them are “completely out of step with the cost increases
brought about by the fuel price increase, thereby distorting the remunerative rate concept established in Law No.

'20 Later, on September 18, 2008, Congress passed a law approving Respondent’s repossession of the Argentine
Airlines, and authorized compensation to be calculated by the Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Nacién, in disregard of
the third-party valuation mechanism of the July 2008 agreement. CM 4 123. Following a disagreement between the
Tribunal de Tasaciones and Credit Suisse, Claimants’ valuator, as to the value of the Argentine Airlines, Congress
passed a law on December 22, 2008 authorizing the expropriation of the Argentine Airlines’ shares that belonged to

sources or emerge at different times does not necessarily mean that the disputes are separate and
distinct.”"

Claimants have characterized the subject matter of their dispute as concerning Respondent’s
treatment of Claimants’ investments in the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest.'"* Respondent
has retorted that the subject matter of the negotiations between the Parties was merely contract
issues and matters of domestic law, which is different from the subject matter of a BIT claim.'™4
However, Respondent’s argument is really just a general assertion that the claim must be
characterized in the same terms (and possibly employing the same legal theories) when it is
being negotiated as when it is finally subjected to arbitration. Again, nothing in the text of
Article X(1)’s reference to “a dispute in connection with investments” requires that the dispute
be characterized solely in terms of Treaty violations.

Given that the formal expropriation alleged does indeed appear to be closely related to, and
follow, what the Claimants characterize as “only the culmination of a creeping expropriation”
that began in October 2004,'° it appears reasonable to conclude that these two core issues are
related to the point that they share the same subject-matter. Therefore, given that the dispute had
crystallized before June 11, 2008, and that the Parties continued to exchange views and work
towards agreement after this point, it is clear that the Claimants have satisfied the 6-month
amicable settlement period.

(b) Futility

Even if the Tribunal were to find that Claimants had not formed a “dispute” within the meaning
of Article X(1) before June 11, 2008, and had not attempted to amicably settle the dispute by the
time they filed the Request for Arbitration on December 11, 2008, the Claimants’ failure to
comply with this obligation should be excused for reasons of futility. Claimants have asserted
that further negotiations with Respondent would be futile, because they have attempted to settle
this dispute from 2002 until May 2008, and then again between October 2008 and early 2010.

ICSID tribunals have held that waiting periods may be waived when further negotiations would
be futile. For example, the tribunal in Occidental held that additional “attempts at reaching a
negotiated solution were indeed futile in the circumstances” where the investor had sought to
rebut allegations in a caducidad proceeding, to no avail, for 18 months before the caducidad
decree was finally issued.'7°

Claimants assert that they continued negotiations with Respondent between October 2008 and
early 2010.'2” These negotiations concerned a potential transaction whereby Respondent would
assume Claimants’ obligations and rights with respect to purchase orders Claimants had placed

for several Airbus aircraft on the Argentine Airlines’ behalf. According to Claimants,
Respondent was interested in assuming these commitments in exchange for the termination of
these ICSID proceedings.'** Respondent has not challenged this assertion.'2” While a draft
agreement was initialed on February 8, 2009, and although Respondent later obtained financing
from the Spanish government for this agreement, Respondent ultimately did not sign the

agreement. 130

This failed transaction, the negotiations for which lasted at least six months, demonstrates that
even after Respondent had received formal notice of Claimants’ legal claims against Respondent
under the Treaty, the Parties continued to attempt but were ultimately unable to reach any sort of
amicable agreement. It is clear, therefore, that requiring Claimants to engage in any further
settlement attempts would serve no further purpose.

(c) The Local Court Requirement of Articles X(2) and (3)

Respondent also argues that Claimants have failed to comply with Articles X(2) and (3), which
require that Claimants’ dispute must be submitted to a local court of the host State for a period of
18 months before they may submit the dispute to this Tribunal.'*' In response, Claimants have
identified two different proceedings that they assert “count” for purposes of Articles X(2) and
(3): first, the valuations of the Argentine Airlines that were conducted in October 2008 and
January 2009, and second, the expropriation lawsuit that was initiated by Respondent against
Interinvest shortly after the January 2009 valuation was completed.

Respondent raises several issues with Claimants’ identified proceedings. First, Claimants’
Request for Arbitration should have been filed only after the dispute was brought before the
Argentine courts; in fact, the expropriation proceedings post-date the filing of these ICSID
proceedings. Second, the expropriation proceedings only concern local laws, not international
investment claims. Third, the parties in the expropriation proceeding—namely, Respondent and
Interinvest—are not identical to the parties to this arbitration proceeding.

The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent’s assertion that the subject matter of the
expropriation suit in domestic court is not the same as the subject matter of this arbitration. It is

29 See also Exhibit C-235, containing a February 8, 2009 draft agreement between Respondent and Interinvest. In

derechos que pudiera eventualmente invocar, como también a todas las acciones entabladas 0 en curso, fundados 0
vinculados a las medidas mencionadas en el pdrrafo anterior [la re-nacionalizacién, estatizacién, expropiacién

3. The dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal in any of the following circumstances: (a) At
the request of one of the parties to the dispute, when no decision has been reached on the merits after a period of 18
months has elapsed as from the moment the judicial proceeding provided for in section 2 of this article was initiated
or When such a decision has been reached, but the dispute between the parties persists; (b) When both parties to the

an

true that the Argentine court proceedings only involved the determination of the value of the
expropriated assets, while the ICSID proceeding raises specific issues related to the validity of
the expropriation (i.e., fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary and unjustified measures, and full
protection and security). As a matter of substance, however, the goal of both suits is to make the
Claimants (and Interinvest, in the case of the Argentine proceeding) whole for the economic loss
suffered as a result of the nationalization. As the ICJ Chamber in ELSI noted,

[T]he local remedies rule does not, indeed cannot, require that a claim be
presented to the municipal courts in a form, and with arguments, suited to an
international tribunal, applying different law to different parties: for an
international claim to be admissible, it is sufficient if the essence of the claim has
been brought before the competent tribunals and pursued as far as permitted by
local law and procedures, and without success.'*”

The Tribunal also finds that the fact that the local court proceeding was brought by Respondent
against Interinvest rather than against Claimants themselves does not affect Claimants’
fulfillment of this requirement. As the ELSJ Chamber acknowledged, international legal
remedies may apply “different law to different parties” than local law remedies do, and this
should not be a barrier to the fulfillment of any local court remedy requirements. That the
domestic expropriation proceedings were brought against Interinvest, an Argentine company
owned by Claimants through Air Comet, does not prevent those proceedings from counting for
purposes of Article X(2) and (3) when the subject matter of those proceedings is the same as that
before this Tribunal.

The Tribunal notes, moreover, that the Treaty permits either party to initiate local court
proceedings for purposes of Article X. In this case, it was Respondent that initiated the dispute
against Interinvest. Therefore, the manner in which the proceedings have been cast by
Respondent in local courts should not give rise to a successful objection against the Claimants
that they failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Article X, as long as the subject
matter of the dispute under the Treaty was considered in the local proceedings, which, in this
case, it was.

Finally, while Claimants concede that the 18-month local court period had not lapsed at the time
they filed their Request for Arbitration, they are correct to note that 18 months have subsequently
passed, and the local suit remains pending. As such, the core objective of this requirement, to
give local courts the opportunity to consider the disputed measures, has been met. To require
Claimants to start over and re-file this arbitration now that their 18 months have been met would
be a waste of time and resources. '*?

alternative, the application of the Treaty’s Most-Favored Nation Clause in relation to
Respondent’s first objection, the Tribunal now turns to this claim.

Dispute Settlement Provisions

Article IV(2) of the Treaty provides that

In all areas governed by this Treaty, such treatment shall not be less favourable
than that accorded by each Contracting Party to investments made within its
territory by investors of a third country.

In their Request for Arbitration, Claimants invoked the MFN clause in Article IV(2), and
asserted that this clause entitles them to use “the more favorable treatment accorded to investors
under, for example, the U.S.-Argentina BIT.”"*4 In their Memorial on the Merits, Claimants
again invoke the MFN clause, reference the U.S.-Argentina BIT as an example, and assert that
they have complied with all the requirements of the U.S.-Argentina BIT in order to access ICSID
arbitration.'*° Then, in their Counter-Memorial, Claimants assert that they rely on the dispute
settlement provisions of the Australia-Argentina BIT.'*° Article 13(1) of the Australia-Argentina
BIT provides that

Any dispute which arises between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party relating to an investment shall, if possible, be settled amicably.
If the dispute cannot so be settled, it may be submitted, upon request of the
investor, either to:

(a) the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party which has admitted the
investment; or

(b) international arbitration in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.

Article 13(3), in turn, provides that the investor may choose international arbitration proceedings
through either ICSID, a tribunal governed by UNCITRAL Rules, or any other mutually-agreed
arbitration rules.

1. Position of Respondent

Respondent asserts that the MFN clause of Article IV(2) of the Treaty may not be used by
Claimants to access the dispute settlement provisions of another BIT to which Argentina and a
third State are parties, for the following reasons:

First, Respondent argues that the obligations contained in Article X—to first hold negotiations
and to submit the dispute to the Argentine courts for 18 months—are jurisdictional requirements
that may not be set aside or disregarded.'*”

Second, Respondent characterizes Article X as part of its standing, unilateral offer to arbitrate.'**
This unilateral offer must be accepted by the investor in order for there to be an arbitration
agreement, and in accepting the offer the investor is not entitled to alter the terms of
acceptance.'*” Arbitration is based on consensus, and if there is no respect for the established
conditions of Respondent’s offer, there can be no consent to arbitration.'”

Third, Respondent asserts that as a rule, MFN clauses contained in BITs are neither arbitration
agreements nor part of the treaty’s offer to arbitrate; they cannot therefore be applied to
jurisdictional matters.'*' An MEN clause may only apply to jurisdictional matters where the
State Parties have so consented. This consent, in turn, must be based on the States’ clear and
unequivocal intentions as expressed in the treaty.

Respondent concedes that arbitral tribunals have not adjudicated this issue uniformly. However,
according to Respondent, starting with Maffezini v. Spain, those tribunals applying MFN clauses
to jurisdictional matters have failed to understand that MFN clauses do not extend to dispute
settlement provisions and are not a part of offers to arbitrate.'** Nor do such decisions reflect the

majority view on the subject. Indeed, an “equal number of decisions” have rejected recourse to
dispute settlement provisions through a treaty’s MFN clause.'* Respondent also notes that
“many” States have subsequently explicitly limited the scope of the MFN treatment in their
bilateral investment treaties in order to avoid the result reached in Maffezini.'**

Fourth, Respondent argues that the ordinary meaning of the Treaty’s MFN clause does not
demonstrate the two States’ clear and unequivocal intention to apply it to the provisions on the
settlement of disputes, either in accordance with the rules on treaty interpretation in the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”) or in accordance with the ejusdem generis
principle.

To the contrary, argues Respondent, substantial evidence demonstrates that the States’ intention
was for the MEN clause not to apply to matters of jurisdiction and procedure.'*” Respondent
asserts that the 18-month clause is an essential provision of the Treaty which was specifically
negotiated by Argentina and Spain, as it has been in some—but not all—of Argentina’s BITs.'**
Moreover, at the time the Treaty was concluded, both Parties had entered into other BITs that did
not contain local court preconditions. It is therefore impossible that the Parties intended for the
Treaty’s MFN clause to apply to dispute settlement provisions, because such an interpretation
would have immediately deprived Article X of all effect.’ Finally, Argentina continued to
include 18-month court provisions in subsequent BITs. Such provisions would be meaningless if
it was possible for them to be set aside by applying an MEN clause.'”

Fifth, Respondent asserts that Claimants cannot be allowed to import parts of the dispute
settlement clause of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which contains a fork-in-the-road provision.'*! The
dispute settlement provisions of the Treaty and the U.S.-Argentina BIT are fundamentally
different and incommensurate. Under the Treaty, if the dispute is not submitted to the Argentine
courts, it may not proceed to international arbitration, whereas under the U.S.-Argentina BIT, if
the dispute is submitted to the Argentine courts, it may not subsequently proceed to international
arbitration. There is no evidence that Spain and Argentina accepted, through the application of
the Treaty’s MFN clause, such a “radical change” in their consent to international jurisdiction.

Sixth, Respondent argues that the authentic interpretation of the State Parties to the Treaty is
clear. In Maffezini, in which an Argentine investor sued Spain under the Treaty, the Kingdom of
Spain adopted the same position as the Argentine Republic is taking in the instant case regarding
the inapplicability of the MFN clause to dispute settlement provisions.'*> The unilateral
interpretation previously made by Spain has now been upheld by the Argentine Republic, thus

making it an authentic interpretation of the Treaty in accordance with Article 31(3) of the
VcLT.'*

Seventh, Respondent asserts that Claimants’ invocation of Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina
BIT, through application of the MFN clause in their Counter-Memorial, is not timely and must
be dismissed.'* To change the instrument upon which they are relying at this point is against the
principle of good faith and should be barred by estoppel.'*° It also severely affects Respondent’s
right to defend itself and turns the jurisdiction of this Tribunal into a moving target.'*”

2. Position of Claimants

Claimants assert that through the operation of the MFN provision in Article IV(2) of the Spain-
Argentina BIT, they may rely on the procedural rules on admissibility of investor-state claims
contained in Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT, rather than the provisions set forth in
Article X of the Treaty. Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT provides neither the 6-month
nor the 18-month requirements contained in the Treaty’s Article X.!°*

Claimants assert that the text of Article IV(2) of the Treaty clearly indicates that the MFN
standard can be relied on with respect to the waiting periods provided in Article X.'*” The MEN
clause is extremely broad because it encompasses “all matters” dealt with in the Treaty.’ The
third and fourth paragraphs of Article IV list exhaustively those matters that are excluded from
the scope of the MFN clause. This list does not include dispute-resolution provisions or “waiting
periods.”'*! Therefore, on the basis of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the MEN clause
extends to all matters not expressly excluded.'

Second, according to Claimants, there is no rule that an MFN clause can only be deemed to
apply to dispute settlement provisions where there is evidence that this is the Parties’ clear and
unequivocal intention. Argentina’s reliance on this purported special presumption finds no
support in either the VCLT or international jurisprudence.’

Third, Claimants assert that the case law decided under the Treaty’s MFN clause'™ unanimously
supports Claimants’ position. In each of the four cases, the claimants invoked Article IV(2) to

. Fourth, Claimants note that a number of other arbitral tribunals have permitted claimants to

invoke MEN clauses of their applicable BITs in order to bypass waiting periods. In those cases,
despite the fact that the base BIT contained waiting periods, the tribunals granted the claimants
the more favorable treatment of other treaties.'°° According to Claimants, only three'®’ out of a
total of thirteen tribunals have rejected the invocation of an MFN clause to displace an 18-month
local court precondition to international arbitration.'** However, the MFN clauses of the
applicable BITs in Wintershall, ICS and Daimler were substantially different from that of the
present Treaty’s MEN clause, and the facts of those cases were also substantially different.'°

Claimants argue that Respondent is wrong to characterize the jurisprudence on this issue as being
sharply divided.'” Instead, Respondent included in its case survey a series of decisions which
are distinguishable from the instant case.'’! Those cases did not concern use of the MFN clause
to bypass procedural or admissibility-related waiting periods (which depend solely on the action
and filing date of the claimant). Instead, the claimants in those cases sought to use the MFN
clause to extend the Tribunal’s substantive jurisdiction.'”

. Fifth, Claimants assert that Respondent’s treaty negotiation practice demonstrates that it did not

include waiting periods in many of its BITs. Only 10 of the 50 BITs referenced in Respondent’s
Memorial provide for the 18-month period. This further confirms that such provisions are
procedural and technical in nature, and do not relate to matters of fundamental public policy for
Argentina.

Sixth, according to Claimants, Respondent has not put forth an “authentic interpretation” of the
text based on the State Parties’ subsequent practice. What Argentina is claiming is not an

courts. Claimants, therefore, would not be precluded from going to international arbitration
under the U.S.-Argentina BIT.'””

Finally, Claimants assert that their invocation of the Australia-Argentina BIT is not untimely.
According to Claimants, they relied on the MFN clause even before they submitted their Request
for Arbitration.'”* Moreover, Claimants relied on the Australia-Argentina BIT for the first time
in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction because Argentina itself only raised its objection with
respect to the 6-month waiting period for the first time in its Memorial on Jurisdiction.'”

3. Analysis of the Tribunal

b. The Ordinary Meaning of Article IV

159. Article IV, captioned “Treatment,” provides as follows:

1. Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of
investments made by investors of the other Party.

2. In all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be not less
favourable than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory
by investors of a third country.

3. Such treatment shall not extend, however, to the privileges which either Party
may grant investors of a third State by virtue of its participation in:
-a free trade area;
-a customs union;
-a common market;
-a regional integration agreement; or

for example to the investors of the United States or the Republic of Chile”).

An organization of mutual economic assistance by virtue of an agreement

4. The treatment accorded under this article shall not extend to tax deductions or
exemptions or other analogous privileges granted by either Party to investors of
third countries by virtue an agreement to prevent double taxation or any other tax
agreement.

160. On its face, the language of Article IV(2) is broad. It applies to “‘all matters governed by this

16

Agreement.” Its language in Spanish is no less broad: “en todas las materias regidas por el
presente Acuerdo.” “All,” or “todas,” is unambiguously inclusive. “Matters,” or “materias,” is
also broad and general. While not decisive on the issue, it is illustrative to note that other BITs
have confined the application of MFN treatment to a smaller category of activities than Article
IV(2)’s broad “all matters” language. The Argentina-Germany BIT,” for example, contains
more constrained provisions:

- Article 3(1): None of the Contracting Parties shall accord in its territory to the
investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party or to
investments in which they hold shares, a less favorable treatment than the
treatment granted to the investments of its own nationals or companies or to the
investments of nationals or companies of third States.

- Article 3(2): Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards its activities related to
investments, to a less favorable treatment than the one accorded to its own
nationals and companies or to nationals and companies of third States.'*!

. The MFN clause in the Italy-Jordan BIT at dispute in Salini v. Jordan also contains a more

limited scope of application:

- Both Contracting Parties, within the bounds of their own territory, shall grant
investments effected by, and the income accruing to, investors of the Contracting

'89 The Argentina-Germany BIT was at issue in Wintershall, Hochtief, Daimler and Siemens AG v. Argentine
Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Decision on Jurisdiction, August 3, 2004 (hereinafter “Siemens v.
Argentina”), Exhibit C-330.

'S! Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments, April 9, 1991, UNTS Vol. 1910, 171 (1996)(emphasis added). Ad Article 3 in
the Protocol to the Argentina-Germany BIT provides as follows: “(a) The following shall more particularly, though
not exclusively, be deemed “activity” within the meaning of article 3, paragraph 2: the management, utilization, use
and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed
“treatment less favourable” within the meaning of article 3: less favourable measures that affect the purchase of raw
materials and other inputs, energy or fuel, or means of production or operation of any kind or the marketing of
products inside or outside the country. Measures that are adopted for reasons of internal or external security or
public order, public health or morality shall not be deemed “treatment less favourable” within the meaning of article

Party no less favourable treatment than that accorded to investments effected by,
and income accruing to, its own nationals or investors of Third States.!

Likewise, the MFN clause in the U.K.-Argentina BIT at dispute in JCS v. Argentina contains a
more limited scope of application:

- Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other
Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it
accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State.'**

In the BITs referenced above, MFN treatment only applies to qualifying “investments,”
“activities related to investments,” “income accruing” to investors, or “management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of those investments. Such terms are narrower than
the general “matters” language contained in the Treaty. Moreover, none of these other BITs
contains the simple and expansive “all” of the Treaty.'**

Other subsections of Article IV of the Treaty contain explicit carve-outs to the application of
MEN treatment. Article IV(3) provides that MFN treatment shall not extend to the treatment
either Party extends to third states by virtue of their common participation in a free trade area, a
customs union, a common market, a regional integration agreement or an organization of mutual
economic assistance. Article IV(4) provides that MFN treatment shall not extend to the
treatment either Party extends to investors of third states concerning tax deductions or similar
provisions. The issues of jurisdiction and admissibility are absent from this list of explicit carve-
outs.

The Tribunal notes that investment arbitration jurisprudence on the ordinary meaning of MFN
provisions has not been entirely consistent, even when the same BIT is concerned. Notably, each
of the cases that has addressed Article IV(2) of the Treaty has concluded that the broad language
of the MEN clause applies to the Article X dispute resolution provisions.'** However, other

'8 ICS vy. Argentina, Award on Jurisdiction, at {| 65. As noted above, the JCS Tribunal determined that the MFN
clause of the U.K.-Argentina BIT did not apply for purposes of dispute settlement provisions, In reaching this
conclusion, the tribunal pointed to 1) the state of the law at the time the BIT was concluded and the expectation of
the parties were such that, without express language in the treaty, treatment could not have extended to dispute
resolution mechanisms (| 285-296); 2) the contextual language established that “treatment” only referred to the
“management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of” an investment (4 297-304); and 3) the phrase “in its
territory” imposes a territorial limitation that excludes international arbitration, which is in the nature of an extra-
territorial dispute settlement procedure (4{] 305-309).

Spain, “the only one that speaks of “all matters subject to this Agreement” in its most favored nation clause, is the
one with Argentina, All other treaties, including those with Uruguay and Chile, omit this reference and merely
provide that “this treatment” shall be subject to the clause, which is of course a narrower formulation.”).

an

tribunals have disagreed. The Belgium/Luxembourg-Soviet Union BIT applied by the tribunal in
Berschader contained “all matters” language similar to that of the Spain-Argentina BIT.
Nonetheless, the Berschader tribunal rejected the claimant’s attempt to use the MFN clause. In
contrast with the tribunals in Maffezini, Gas Natural and the Suez cases, the tribunal in
Berschader noted that “all matters covered by the present treaty” cannot be interpreted
“literally,” because the MFN clause is not capable of being applied at all to several of the matters
covered by the BIT.'*°

Likewise, the tribunals that have adjudicated the MFN provisions of the Argentina-Germany BIT
have not uniformly interpreted the ordinary meaning of that BIT’s MEN provisions.'*’ The
tribunals in Siemens and Hochtief concluded that the language of the MFN provisions (language
that is less sweeping and more particularized than the MFN clause in the instant Treaty)
implicitly included dispute settlement provisions.'** However, the tribunals in Wintershall and
Daimler disagreed.'*” The Wintershall tribunal determined that the BIT’s MEN clause in
Article 3 “does not mention that the most-favoured-nation “treatment” as to investments, and
investment related activities, is to be in respect of “all relations” or that it extends to “all
aspects” or covers “all matters in the treaty.”””'°° The Daimler tribunal, for its part, determined
that the language of the Argentina-Germany BIT’s MFN clause was territorially limited, that
“treatment” was intended by the parties to refer only to treatment of the investment, and that the
BIT did not extend MEN treatment to “all matters” subject to the BIT."

(a) Jurisprudence Concerning the Application of MFN Clauses to
Dispute Settlement Provisions

This Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of previous tribunals, and it makes its determination
on a basis of the text of the Treaty and the factual and legal arguments put forth by the Parties.
Nonetheless, the Tribunal acknowledges that it does not adjudicate in a vacuum. The issue of
application of MFN clauses to dispute settlement provisions has been addressed by numerous
panels and in numerous factual scenarios. Moreover, both Parties have made extensive analyses
and arguments on the case law on this issue. Below, the Tribunal will identify the points on
which the different case holdings can be distinguished, and the points on which there is
analytical disagreement between tribunals.

i. UNCTAD’s Case Taxonomy

168. As noted by Claimants, UNCTAD’s recent publication on Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment”

169.

170.

171.

categorizes the cases addressing the application of MFN clauses to jurisdiction in a way that
largely corresponds with each case’s outcome.

UNCTAD sorts the cases into two categories. In the first category, claimants “have invoked the
MEN treatment clause to override a procedural requirement that constitutes a condition for the
submission of a claim to international arbitration.”"?> UNCTAD refers to this category of cases
as concerning “admissibility” requirements. In the second category, claimants “have attempted
to extend via MFN the jurisdictional threshold, i.e., the scope of the mandate of the arbitral
tribunal, beyond that specifically set forth in the basic treaty. This use of the MFN clause would
give the arbitral tribunal jurisdiction to hear issues or disputes that the basic treaty does not
contemplate or expressly excludes.”'°* UNCTAD refers to this category of cases as concerning
“scope of jurisdiction.”

UNCTAD identifies the following cases as fitting within the “admissibility” '° category:
Maffezini, Siemens, Gas Natural, National Grid, 6 Suez InterAguas, AWG Group!” and
Wintershall. To these cases, the Tribunal would add Impregilo,'°* Hochtief ,'”
Abaclat2° ICS2°' and Daimler?” In each of these cases, the claimant was required under the
respective terms of its BIT’s dispute settlement provisions to seek a remedy before a local court
of the host State for a period of time before bringing arbitration. Each of the claimants in these
cases sought to use its BIT’s MFN clause in order to “borrow” a dispute settlement provision
from another treaty that did not contain a local court requirement as a precondition of arbitration.
With the exceptions of Wintershall, ICS and Daimler the claimants’ arguments were successful.
UNCTAD identifies the following cases as fitting within the “scope of jurisdiction” category:
Salini, Plama, Telenor, Berschader, and Tza Yap Shum. 4 Tn these cases, the claimants sought
to use the MFN clause to expand the scope of jurisdiction under their applicable BIT. In Salini,
the claimant attempted to use the MFN clause to bring in contract claims before an ICSID
tribunal. In Plama, the claimant attempted to use the MFN clause to broaden the scope of

jurisdiction beyond that of its applicable BIT, which only provided jurisdiction to resolve issues
of compensation in the case of an expropriation.2°° Similarly, in Telenor and Berschader, the
claimants attempted to use the MFN clause to broaden jurisdiction beyond their BITs, which
only provided jurisdiction over expropriation claims.” In each of these cases, the claimant’s
attempts to rely on the MFN clause were rejected by the tribunals. UNCTAD identified only one
case within this category, RosInvestCo, that departed from this trend.?””

Looking at the taxonomy above, it is clear that Claimants’ position falls within the
“admissibility” category of cases cited by UNCTAD, in which tribunals normally rule in favor of
applying the MFN clause. Claimants are seeking to apply the Treaty’s MFN clause in order to
dispense with the requirements of Article X, namely, that the Parties attempt to amicably settle
their dispute for 6 months, and that their dispute be subjected to the local courts of Argentina for
18 months.

ii. Other Interpretative Issues

In addition to looking at case law according to outcome, the Tribunal considers the interpretative
assumptions underlying tribunals’ decisions. At least one of the tribunals in the “admissibility”
cases identified by UNCTAD looked for evidence that the State parties did not intend to include
dispute settlement provisions within the scope of the MFN clause. As the tribunal in Gas
Natural stated, “Unless it appears clearly that the state parties to a BIT or the parties to a
particular investment agreement settled on a different method for resolution of disputes that may
arise, most-favored-nation provisions in BITs should be understood to be applicable to dispute
settlement.”

In contrast, tribunals in the “scope of jurisdiction” cases have taken as a starting principle that
the extension of the MFN clause to cover jurisdictional issues cannot be assumed. As the
tribunal in Plama set forth, “an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by
reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, unless the
MEN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to
incorporate them.” According to Plama, “an arbitration clause must be clear and
unambiguous and the reference to an arbitration clause must be such as to make the clause part
of the contract (treaty).””"°

Likewise, tribunals have differed in their views on whether dispute settlement provisions
constitute a vital protection of foreign investors. Many of the tribunals following the Maffezini

38

Decision on Jurisdiction have determined that these provisions are a fundamental part of the
“treatment” or protection owed to investors:

“Notwithstanding the fact that the basic treaty containing the clause does not refer
expressly to dispute settlement as covered by the most favored nation clause, the
Tribunal considers that there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute
settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign
investors, as they are also related to the protection of rights of traders under

. p 992
treaties of commerce.”*"!

“From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the
stated purposes of both the Argentina-Spain BIT and the Argentina-U.K. BIT,
dispute settlement is as important as other matters governed by the BITs and is an
integral part of the investment protection regime that the respective sovereign
states have agreed upon.” 2

“(T]he Tribunal considers that the critical issue is whether or not the dispute
settlement provisions of bilateral investment treaties constitute part of the bundle
of protections granted to foreign investors by host states. As the Tribunal sees the
history, first of the ICSID Convention, which created the institution of investor-
state arbitration, and subsequently of the wave of bilateral investment treaties
between developed and developing countries (and in some instances between
developing countries inter se), a crucial element — indeed perhaps the most
crucial element — has been the provision for independent international arbitration
of disputes between investors and host states. The creation of ICSID and the
adoption of bilateral investment treaties offered to investors assurances that
disputes that might flow from their investments would not be subject to the
perceived hazards of delays and political pressures of adjudication in national
courts.”

“Access to [dispute settlement] mechanisms is part of the protection offered under

the Treaty. It is part of the treatment of foreign investors and investments and of
. 2

the advantages accessible through a MFN clause. |

“Article X[’s dispute settlement provision] is a benefit conferred on investors and
designed to protect their interests and the interests of a State Party in its capacity
as a host State party to a dispute with an investor: it is a protective right that sits
alongside the guarantees against arbitrary and discriminatory measures,
expropriation, and so on!

~

The above tribunals do not share the concern expressed by Respondent, and by a few other
tribunals, that such an approach disregards the fundamental requirement that a State Party
consent to jurisdiction. For example, the tribunal in Telenor noted, “[W]hat has to be applied is
not some abstract principle of investment protection in favour of a putative investor who is not a
party to the BIT and who at the time of its conclusion is not even known, but the intention of the
States who are the contracting parties.”*'* Because consent is a basic requirement for
jurisdiction over a State, and because the terms of consent to arbitration are negotiated on an
individual basis for each BIT, these tribunals were unwilling to assume, without explicit
language by the State Parties on this point, that the jurisdictional requirements of one BIT can be
borrowed by an investor of a third State.

The position taken by each tribunal may very well be influenced to an extent by the facts before
it. The tribunals that considered whether MFN protection could extend to admissibility
requirements were not asked to extend the reach of MFN protection to provisions that would
change the arbitral forum or the scope of matters that could be subjected to arbitration. In
contrast, the tribunals that considered the latter issue were not required to assess whether MFN
protection could cover admissibility requirements.

In Plama, for example, while the tribunal held that the MFN clause could not be used to
substitute the BIT’s dispute settlement mechanism in favor of ICSID arbitration, it also
expressed a certain sympathy for the Maffezini tribunal:

The decision in Maffezini is perhaps understandable. The case concerned a
curious requirement that during the first 18 months the dispute be tried in the local
courts. The present Tribunal sympathizes with a tribunal that attempts to
neutralize such a provision that is nonsensical from a practical point of view.
However, such exceptional circumstances should not be treated as a statement of
general principle guiding future tribunals in other cases where exceptional
circumstances are not present.”!”

What the Plama tribunal characterized as Maffezini’s “curious” 18-month local court
requirement has not proved to be as “exceptional” as the Plama tribunal suggests. Since the
Plama decision on jurisdiction was issued, numerous tribunals have addressed the application of
MEN clauses to 18-month local court requirements.”'* In any case, the Plama tribunal’s dictum
suggests a view that treatment of a requirement may vary depending on the nature of that
requirement.

Moreover, the tribunal in Maffezini itself was careful to stress that its decision was bounded by
“important limits arising from public policy considerations.””'? Maffezini included within these
limits BIT clauses that provide for a specific arbitration forum, such as ICSID, and that provide

216 Telenor v. Hungary, Award, at | 95. See also Wintershall v. Argentina, Award, at { 179, which notes with
approval the tribunals that do not “regard as sufficient a consent of the Host State to international arbitration which
would be a merely presumed consent.”

for a highly institutionalized system of arbitration with precise rules of procedure.” For the
Maffezini tribunal, such provisions cannot be replaced or bypassed.

To be sure, several tribunals have criticized the Maffezini public policy limits. The Plama
tribunal noted that Maffezini did not specify the origin or the basis of these “public policy”
considerations.”! The Salini and Wintershail tribunals asserted that the limits identified by
Maffezini did not do enough to prevent the risk of treaty shopping.*” Nonetheless, a significant
number of tribunals have either directly applied Maffezini’s four limitations or have used its
discussion as the basis for an inquiry into what public policy considerations animated the State
parties’ formulation of their MFN clauses. For example, in Plama and Berschader, the tribunals
found it significant that the BIT was concluded while the State respondents were still communist
governments, favoring limited dispute settlement and limited protections for investors.””?

In light of the above discussion, the Tribunal is cognizant of the concern articulated by numerous
tribunals that the reach of the MFN clause not extend beyond appropriate limits. The Tribunal
also acknowledges that the nature of the dispute settlement provisions that Claimants seek to
replace via the Article IV(2) MEN clause is relevant to any such determination.

In that respect, the Tribunal finds it significant that Claimants have not requested that the
Tribunal apply the MFN clause in order to replace the Treaty’s provisions on the arbitral forum
or rules. Nor have Claimants requested that the Tribunal apply the MFN clause in order to
broaden the scope of legal issues that may be adjudicated through arbitration. Instead, they have
argued that the procedural requirements of Article X, namely the negotiation and local court
requirements, may be bypassed in favor of the more procedurally limited dispute settlement
provisions of the Australia-Argentina BIT.

(b) The dispute settlement clause of the U.S.-Argentina BIT and
the Australia-Argentina BIT

As a final argument, Respondent has protested Claimants’ invocation of the U.S.-Argentina BIT
and the Australia-Argentina BIT on two grounds. First, Respondent asserts that Claimants
cannot take advantage of the U.S.-Argentina BIT’s dispute settlement provisions because there is
no advantage to take; the U.S.-Argentina BIT’s fork-in-the-road provisions (providing for either
a local court remedy or an arbitral remedy) are not better, but simply constitute a different
settlement regime. Second, Respondent argues that Claimants’ invocation of the Australia-

3 Plama y. Bulgaria, Decision on Jurisdiction, at ] 195-97; Berschader v. Russian Federation, Award, at §§ 200,
203.

24 The relevant provisions of Article VII of U.S.-Argentina BIT, on dispute settlement include the following:
Article VII(2): “In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution
through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned
may choose to submit the dispute for resolution: (a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party | that is a
party to the dispute; or (b) in dance with any applicable, previously agreed disput or
(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.” Article VII(3) provides that “Provided that the national or
company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b)... the national or

Argentina BIT is inadmissible because it was untimely presented, and that modifying the dispute
settlement procedures invoked “severely affects” its right to defend its interests.

On the first point, it is clear that the U.S.-Argentina BIT (and the Australia-Argentina BIT) has
advantages that the Treaty does not; under the former, it is possible to access arbitration with
fewer procedural preconditions. Moreover, Claimants have not already selected the local court
“fork” under the U.S.-Argentina BIT. Article X(3)(a) of the Treaty is satisfied when either the
Respondent or the investor brings the suit before a local court. Here, it was the Respondent that
brought a suit against Interinvest in the Argentine courts relating to the expropriation of the
Argentine Airlines. As such, it is clear that Claimants have not already “picked” the local court
“fork,” thereby forfeiting their access to arbitration.

On the second point, the Tribunal notes that Respondent does not point to any actual or
perceived harm, nor is there any evidence that Claimants’ switch from relying on the U.S.-
Argentina BIT to relying on the Australia-Argentina BIT would have any effect on the
arguments made by Respondent. As such, the Tribunal rejects this argument.

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that Claimants may equally rely on the Article IV(2) MFN
clause of the Treaty to make use of the dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 13 of
the Australia-Argentina BIT. The broad “all matters” language of the Article [V(2) MFN clause
is unambiguously inclusive. Moreover, applying the dispute settlement provisions contained in
Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT would not change the scope, the forum or the rules
applicable to this arbitration. Claimants have satisfied the requirements of Article 13 of the
Australia-Argentina BIT, which states that any dispute “shall, if possible, be settled amicably,”
and which permits an investor to submit the dispute to international arbitration in the event that it
cannot be settled. Claimants have clearly complied with this provision.

ce Second Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants’ Standing
i. Claimants’ Investment in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines
1. Position of Respondent

Respondent argues that Claimants’ claims, which are based on the alleged violation of rights
held by Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines, are derivative and indirect in nature. As such,
argues Respondent, Claimants do not have standing to bring this claim. On one hand, Claimants
are claiming rights that are vested in third parties (namely, Interinvest and the Argentine

 

company may choose to consent in writing to the submission to the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration” to
ICSID, to the ICSID Additional Facility, in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration or to any other mutually
agreed arbitration institution. Note that Respondent’s argument could be extended to the Australia-Argentina BIT
invoked by Claimants. Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT provides that “1. Any dispute which arises
between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party relating to an investment shall, if
possible, be settled amicably. If the dispute cannot so be settled, it may be submitted, upon request of the investor,
either to: (a) the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment; or (b) international
arbitration,” including to ICSID, in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or to any other mutually
agreed arbitration institution.

Airlines) who are not parties to this arbitration.”° On the other hand, Claimants have only

indirect shareholdings in these companies, which they hold through the Spanish intermediary
company Air Comet S.A.””

According to Respondent, Claimants bring two different indirect claims. The first of these
claims relates to Interinvest S.A.’s rights. Respondent asserts that Interinvest, an Argentine
company which is not protected under the Treaty, is the only entity with legal standing to
complain of the alleged expropriation of the Argentine Airlines’ shares.”* The second of these
claims relates to the rights of ARSA and AUSA. Here, according to Respondent, Claimants also
invoke a set of rights which are not held by them.’ The only entities with legal standing to
complain of the adoption of airfare regulatory measures are ARSA and AUSA, the parties whose
assets were affected by the measures.”*°

Respondent asserts that it did not adopt any measure to the detriment of Claimants’ own
investment. None of Claimants’ shares in Air Comet were expropriated. Furthermore, the rights
deriving from those shares were not infringed, nor was their exercise limited in any way.”"!
There is a distinction between the rights of companies and of their shareholders,”” and it would
be unjust to award compensation to a person or an entity that is not entitled to obtain redress.**

According to Respondent, Claimants’ indirect claim is inadmissible under the Treaty, which
affords no protection to indirect shareholders.** Respondent notes that while some investment
treaties refer to the “direct or indirect” control of assets or provide for the protection of both the
rights and interests of investors, the Treaty does not allow indirect claims to be filed.’*°
Moreover, in defining “investment,” the Treaty includes property and rights acquired by foreign
investors."*° It does not protect the mere shareholders’ interests in the companies in which they
have an indirect shareholding.”*”

Furthermore, Respondent asserts that Claimants’ indirect claim is inadmissible under general
international law.”** It is a general principle of law that the company’s shareholders cannot
complain of alleged violations of rights vested in the company in which they hold shares.” The
decisions rendered by the International Court of Justice have consistently maintained that, under
international law, shareholders are not entitled to assert the rights of the companies in which they
have a shareholding. In other words, derivative claims are not valid.“° Respondent notes that

the European Court of Human Rights has also rejected the admissibility of indirect actions.”4!
Under international law, indirect or derivative claims can only be accepted where a treaty has
expressly provided for indirect or derivative actions,”

Respondent also argues that the ICSID Convention does not allow indirect or derivative claims
to be filed. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention lays down the objective criteria for a dispute to
fall within the jurisdiction of the Centre.? When the ICSID Convention was drafted, the
drafters considered allowing controlling shareholders of domestic companies to bring claims to
enforce the rights of the companies in which they held shares.“* However, the drafters
ultimately rejected this possibility. Instead, they drafted Article 25(2)(b), which provides for the
possibility of a domestic but foreign-controlled company to sue its own State when the parties
agreed that the domestic company would be treated as a national of the other State due to its
foreign control.“

It is further Respondent’s view that neither the ICSID Convention nor international investment
law or customary or general international law provide for a jurisprudence constante principle.”*°
The judicial decisions cited favorably by Claimants that concern BITs permitting indirect
shareholding are not applicable to this dispute.”4”

Respondent also urges that Claimants’ indirect claim is inadmissible under Argentine law.
Argentine law does not allow indirect claims to be filed, and the corporation is the only entity
empowered to defend its own interests.“* Respondent notes that general international law and
the Treaty require that the Tribunal apply the domestic law of the State in which the shareholder
holds interests in order to decide on the rights that may be invoked by a shareholder under
international law.” It has been recognized in ICSID decisions that domestic law is relevant for
the purposes of determining ICSID’s jurisdiction.”

Respondent makes a number of policy claims regarding Claimants’ standing. It asserts that
Claimants disregard the set of legal relationships existing among the companies which are part of
the corporate chain connecting Teinver S.A. to the Argentine Airlines, as well as those
relationships between these companies and their own creditors.”*' If the Tribunal were to order
Respondent to pay Claimants compensation, then Claimants would be allocated payments that
should have been prioritized for the Argentine Airlines’ creditors and the remaining intermediary
companies. Claimants, as the last link in this chain of creditors and shareholders, would be
unjustly enriched.”

Furthermore, Respondent asserts that there is an actual risk of double or multiple claims, because
there is nothing to prevent Interinvest S.A. from filing an action before the Argentine courts in
parallel with the present arbitration.“ Multiple claims could potentially lead to a situation of
double recovery. In addition, allowing Claimants to file this indirect action erroneously
implies that shareholders have a right to the preservation of the value of their holdings, when in
fact, the value of stockholdings varies according to the fluctuations in corporate assets.”°>

Finally, Respondent points out that only Teinver S.A. currently owns shares in Air Comet.
Between October 2007 and December 2009, both Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses
Urbanos transferred all of their shares in Air Comet to Teinver. As such, Transportes de
Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos are neither direct nor indirect shareholders in the Argentine
companies.”*°

2. Position of Claimants

Claimants assert that they are not claiming rights held by Interinvest and/or the Argentine
Airlines. Rather, they are claiming in their own name and on their own behalf, on the basis of
the rights conferred on them by the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.” Claimants reiterate that
their own claims include the following actions taken by Respondent: 1) formally expropriating
Claimants’ investment in the Argentine Airlines without any compensation; 2) effectuating the
creeping expropriation of their investments in the Argentine Airlines; 3) failing to treat
Claimants’ investment in Interinvest and the Argentina Airlines fairly and equitably; 4)
impairing by unjustified and discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, extension or disposal of Claimants’ investments in Interinvest and the Argentine
Airlines; 5) failing to provide the required protection to Claimants’ investments in Interinvest
and the Argentine Airlines; and 6) violating specific obligations entered into with respect to
Claimants’ investment in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines.”

Claimants argue that these claims arise directly from their rights under the Treaty, that is, the
protection that Respondent owes directly to Claimants as Spanish investors in Argentina.
Claimants are thus not asserting contractual rights held by the Argentine companies in question.
Claimants are entitled to claim that Respondent’s conduct was in breach of the Treaty, regardless
of whether that conduct may also amount to a breach of Interinvest’s or the Argentine Airlines’
rights under local law.”

Claimants assert that claims by both direct and indirect shareholders for measures impacting
their shareholdings are admissible under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, and are well
recognized in international law. First, Claimants assert that claims by shareholders for harm
caused to their shareholdings have been unanimously upheld by ICSID tribunals. While

Respondent asserts that a shareholder may not recover damages for harm caused to its “shares
and other forms of participation” in companies incorporated in the host-State, virtually all ICSID
tribunals that have decided similar objections unanimously have rejected them. Moreover,
ICSID tribunals have acknowledged that an indirect shareholder could claim damages “suffered
by a company in which it holds shares,” even though the applicable BIT did not contain the
“direct or indirect” wording.”“!

. Second, Claimants argue that claims by indirect shareholders are admissible under the wording

of the Treaty. While the Treaty does not contain “direct or indirect” language, Article I(2) of the
Treaty provides that “any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind [including]
shares and other forms of participation in companies” constitute qualifying investments. Under
this inclusive formulation, indirect shareholders may pursue claims for measures affecting their
“shares and other forms of participation in companies.” This conclusion was also reached by
other ICSID tribunals interpreting Article 1(2) of the Treaty." Furthermore, the object and
purpose of the Treaty is to create favorable conditions and to promote capital flow and
investment between investors of the Contracting Parties. This aim is equally pursued through
direct and indirect ownership of investments.”

Third, Claimants argue that international law does not support Respondent’s position, and that
Argentina’s reliance on ICJ case law is misplaced. According to Claimants, the question
addressed in those cases was not whether the shareholders had a cause of action under
international law, but whether, under customary international law, a State could exercise
diplomatic protection over its nationals, who are shareholders with investments affected by a
third State. The right of a particular State to exercise diplomatic protection in favor of its
nationals—even if they are shareholders in foreign companies—is irrelevant to the issue of
whether an investor has standing under a BIT to claim for measures impacting its shareholding in
local companies.”

Fourth, in Claimants’ view, Respondent misinterprets Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.
Article 25(2)(b) is not applicable to the present dispute, since the Treaty lacks any reference to
the Parties’ consent to treat a company incorporated in the host State and controlled by a foreign
investor as a foreign investor for the purposes of the Treaty. Claimants have not even attempted
to invoke 25(2)(b) as a source of jurisdiction.” Furthermore, Argentina misunderstands the
negotiating history of this provision. The issue before the drafters concerned whether to allow
local companies access to the ICSID Convention in certain situations such as when they were
owned by foreign nationals.”

Fifth, Claimants assert that Argentine corporate law is irrelevant to decide whether Claimants
have jus standi under the Treaty and international law. Claimants’ claims are Treaty claims, and
they do not constitute an exercise of rights under Argentine domestic law.?”

Sixth, Claimants argue that Argentina’s policy concerns are immaterial to the outcome of the
current arbitration and, in any case, are misleading and unfounded. Claimants assert that none of
Respondent’s policy objections has any support in the Treaty, the ICSID Convention or
international law, including investment case law.?” Respondent’s concerns about preferential
treatment over third parties (including creditors), double recovery and double-payment pertain to
the merits of the dispute, not to the jurisdictional stage.

Finally, Claimants assert that Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos are legitimate
parties to the arbitration. Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos transferred their
shares to Teinver on December 10, 2009, but this transfer has no impact on their standing in the
current arbitration. The relevant dates for determining ICSID jurisdiction are the dates of
consent and/or registration of the dispute.?” Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos
indirectly held shares in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines both when consent was perfected
and at the time the Request for Arbitration was submitted?”

3. Analysis of the Tribunal

In maintaining that the Claimants do not have standing because they are merely “indirect”
shareholders in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines, Respondent advances two distinct legal
arguments.” The first argument addresses the question whether Claimants, as shareholders, can
recover damages for harms that were inflicted upon the companies in which Claimants invested
(i.e., Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines), as opposed to harms that were inflicted directly
upon Claimants themselves. This will be referred to below as Respondent’s “derivative claim”
argument. Respondent’s second legal argument concerns the question whether Claimants must
be direct shareholders, in the sense that they must directly own the shares in Interinvest, rather
than through an intermediary subsidiary such as Air Comet. This will be referred to below as
Respondent’s “intermediary investor” argument.

(a) Respondent’s “Derivative Claim” Argument
i. Article I of the Treaty

According to Respondent, the Treaty provides no protection to “derivative” shareholders. While
it protects the shareholders’ direct rights arising out of the shares, it does not, in Respondent’s
view, protect the shareholders’ “mere interests” in the companies in which they have the
shareholding. Respondent asserts that while some investment treaties may provide for the

S

protection of both the rights and interests of investors, the Treaty does not provide for this
possibility. Respondent contrasts the language of Article I(2) with the analogous provision of
the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which extends protections to “a company or shares of stock or other
interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof?" Respondent also notes that the U.S.-
Argentina BIT, in contrast to the Treaty, protects investments that are “owned or controlled
directly or indirectly.”?”

While Respondent is correct to note that Article I(2) of the Treaty does not explicitly include or
exclude “indirect” investments from its coverage, the broad and inclusive language of this
provision suggests that “indirect” shareholders are protected by the Treaty. Article I(2) sets forth
the definition of “investments” that are protected under the Treaty:

The term “investments” shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights
of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the
country receiving the investment and in particular, but not exclusively, the
following:

-shares and other forms of participation in companies;

This definition is broad and inclusive. “Investment” encompasses “any kind of assets,”
“property and rights of every kind,” and the list of qualifying investments that follows the
definition is exemplary rather than exclusive. Other ICSID tribunals interpreting the Treaty have
noted the breadth of this definition. The tribunal in Gas Natural noted that “while the ICSID
Convention does not define the term ‘investment,’ the BIT clearly does so in an inclusive way,”
and that the Treaty’s definition “follows the almost universal practice of BITs to define the
subject of the Treaty as comprehensively as possible.”?””

The other ICSID tribunals that have looked at the Treaty have found Article I(2)’s broad
language to implicitly permit the kinds of claims that Claimants have advanced. In the Suez
Vivendi and Suez InterAguas arbitrations, Argentina raised an identical argument, asserting that
the shareholder claimants had no standing to bring the dispute because they were alleging a
merely “derivative” injury based on the injury to the company in which they hold shares, rather
than a direct injury claimants had suffered. The tribunals in these cases rejected this argument,
finding that claimants had a valid “investment” under the terms of the Treaty:

“(U]nder the plain language of these BITs, the Tribunal finds that Suez’s as well
as AGBAR’s and InterAguas’ shares in APSF are “investments” under the
Argentina-France and Argentina-Spain BITs. These shareholders thus benefit
from the treatment promised by Argentina to investments made by French and
Spanish nationals in its territory. Consequently, under Article 8 of the French
treaty and Article X of the Spanish treaty, these shareholder Claimants are entitled
to have recourse to ICSID arbitration to enforce their treaty rights. Neither the

Argentina- France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, nor the ICSID Convention limit
the rights of shareholders to bring actions for direct, as opposed to derivative
claims. This distinction, present in domestic corporate law of many countries,
does not exist in any of the treaties applicable to this case.”””*

It is notable that the Suez tribunals described the Treaty as not limiting the rights of shareholders
to bring “derivative” claims. The tribunals explicitly rejected the notion that there is any
“default” under international investment law that restricts what kinds of claims can be brought.
In this respect, the tribunals refused to take their cues from domestic corporate law. Under this
logic, the fact that the Treaty does not explicitly permit “derivative” actions is irrelevant, because
the very concept of a “derivative” claim is alien to the Treaty or the ICSID Convention.

The tribunal in Gas Natural reached a similar result as the Suez tribunals, using a slightly
different reasoning. In Gas Natural, Argentina again argued that claimant, a shareholder in an
Argentine company that was granted concessions, lacked standing to bring its claim. The
tribunal disagreed. After finding claimant’s shareholdings in the Argentine company to
constitute a valid “investment” under the Treaty, it found the claimant to have standing because
“a claim asserting the impairment of the value of the shares held by Claimant as a result of
measures taken by the host government gives rise to an investment dispute within the meaning of
Article X of the BIT[.]”” The tribunal in Gas Natural accepted that a diminution in the value
of the claimant’s shares constituted an injury under the Treaty. Like the Swez tribunals, the Gas
Natural tribunal was simply not perturbed by the possibility that this claim was merely
“derivative” of an injury to the Argentine company.”*”

In light of the language of Article I(2), this Tribunal finds that the Claimants have standing based
on their investments in the Argentine Airlines. Respondent’s subsequent legal arguments, which
draw on ICJ case law, the ICSID Convention and Argentine law, assert that the “derivative”
distinction matters for purposes of interpreting the Treaty. However, none of Respondent’s
arguments, which are analyzed below, undermine the conclusions reached by this Tribunal in
light of the text of Article I(2).

ii. ICJ Case Law

Respondent asserts that general international law does not permit indirect claims brought by
shareholders for harms suffered by the companies in which they hold shares. Specifically,

Jurisdiction, at | 49.

2” Gas Natural v. Argentina, Decision on Jurisdiction, at §§] 34-35.

°8 The Gas Natural tribunal also implies that it is generally understood that foreign investors acquire rights under
the ICSID Convention and the applicable BIT when they purchase shares in a locally-established corporation:
“Indeed, the standard mode of foreign direct investment, followed in the present case and in the vast majority of
transnational transfers of private capital, is that a corporation is established pursuant to the laws of the host country
and the shares of that corporation are purchased by the foreign investor, or alternatively, that the shares of an
existing corporation established pursuant to the laws of the host country are acquired by the foreign investor. The
scheme of both the ICSID Convention and the bilateral investment treaties is that in this circumstance, the foreign
investor acquires rights under the Convention and Treaty, including in particular the standing to initiate international
arbitration.” (Id. at § 34).

Respondent points to Barcelona Traction (Belgium v. Spain), in which the ICJ held that Belgium
lacked jus standi to exercise diplomatic protection of Belgian national shareholders with respect
to measures taken by Spanish authorities that affected the Canadian company in which the
Belgian nationals held shares.

Claimants argue that Barcelona Traction is not applicable, because the case’s holding does not
concern the direct standing of shareholders, but only whether a right of a state had been violated
as a result of its nationals having suffered an infringement of their rights as shareholders.
However, in order to determine whether Belgium had a right to bring its case, the Court had to
first address the scope of the Belgian nationals’ rights as shareholders. On that issue, the Court
concluded that “Not a mere interest affected, but solely a right infringed involves responsibility,
so that an act directed against and infringing only the company’s rights does not involve
responsibility towards the shareholders, even if their interests are affected.””*!

Nonetheless, Barcelona Traction’s discussion of shareholder rights is inapposite to the
circumstances of the present case for two reasons.

First, the Court’s decision was made in the absence of the specific framework of a BIT. The
Court noted that such treaties, while not applicable to the Belgian shareholders, could give
shareholders a “direct right to defend their interests against states.”*? This indeed is the
Claimants’ case since they brought their claim under a BIT that explicitly protects investments
they have made in any kind of assets, including shares.

Second, the Court acknowledged that international law was silent on the issue of shareholder
rights. In the absence of any international authority, the Court explicitly resorted to municipal
law to provide the content of the shareholders’ rights.’** In the present case, there is no reason to
resort to municipal law when the treaty instrument provides the source of the rights asserted by
the Claimants.

The Court’s analysis in Barcelona Traction was confirmed in its 2007 judgment on preliminary
objections in Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Guinea v. DRC), where the Court noted that foreign
investment treaties have taken primacy under international law in adjudicating the rights of
companies and their shareholders:

The Court is bound to note that, in contemporary international law, the protection
of the rights of companies and the rights of their shareholders, and the settlement
of the associated disputes, are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral
agreements for the protection of foreign investments, such as the treaties for the
promotion and protection of foreign investments, and the Washington Convention
of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States, which created an International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID), and also by contracts between States and foreign
investors. In that context, the role of diplomatic protection somewhat faded, as in

practice recourse is only made to it in rare cases where treaty régimes do not exist
. a?
or have proved inoperative.”

In Diallo, for the reasons explained in Barcelona Traction, the Court was compelled to resort to
the municipal law of the DRC to assess the scope of Mr. Diallo’s rights in the absence of an
applicable BIT.2*°

Contrary to Respondent’s assertions, Barcelona Traction and Diallo do not solidify any general
principle of international law on shareholder rights that should be applied to the present dispute.
Indeed, the Court has taken pains in both Barcelona Traction and Diallo to distinguish these
cases from the situation in which an investment treaty regime would apply.

iii. The ICSID Convention

Respondent argues that the ICSID Convention does not extend protections to claims by
shareholders. Specifically, Respondent asserts that the ICSID Convention’s drafters had
discussed the possibility of allowing shareholders of domestic companies to bring claims, but
that this idea was ultimately rejected in favor of Article 25(2)(b) as it currently stands.

However, there is no evidence that the ICSID Convention’s drafters rejected the possibility of
shareholders bringing “derivative” suits under the ICSID Convention. The history cited by
Respondent only concerns a very specific issue that arose in the ICSID Convention’s
negotiations concerning the nationality of claimants. As Christoph Schreuer explained in his
authoritative Commentary, while the ICSID Convention was intended for disputes between a
State and a national of another State, and not for disputes between a State and its own nationals,
the drafters were aware that the reality on the ground could be more complicated. Many States
required a foreign investor to carry out its activities under a locally incorporated company.”**
While such a company would otherwise be precluded from bringing a suit because of its
nationality, the drafters ultimately created Article 25(2)(b) as an exception to the nationality
requirement to accommodate this situation.

Therefore, to the extent that the drafters “rejected” the suggestion that the local company’s
shareholders be granted standing, it was only in this specific and limited context. Moreover, the
drafters rejected this suggestion in this specific context for practical reasons rather than because
of any general view that “derivative” actions should not be permitted under the ICSID
Convention: they noted that such an arrangement “would not be feasible where shares are widely
scattered and their owners are insufficiently organized.”?*’

Finally, Article 25(2)(b) simply is not relevant to these proceedings. Claimants are nationals of
another State, not a local Argentine company. Moreover, in order for Article 25(2)(b) to apply,
the State parties to a BIT must agree to treat locally incorporated companies in this manner.
Spain and Argentina did not so agree in their Treaty or elsewhere.

iv. Argentine Law

Respondent has asserted that Argentine law does not permit “derivative” claims to be brought by
shareholders to recover for injuries done to the companies in which shareholders own shares.
However, Respondent fails to demonstrate how Argentine corporate law is relevant to the issue
of jurisdiction.

Respondent has argued that “it has been recognized that domestic law is relevant for the
purposes of determining ICSID’s jurisdiction.”*** Respondent is, of course, correct that
domestic law may be “relevant” to jurisdictional issues. However, the cases cited by Respondent
address the situation in which domestic law is used by a tribunal to determine a question of fact
in connection to a jurisdictional issue.” In none of these cases does domestic law define the
basic jurisdictional requirements. Instead, domestic law may be used by a tribunal in order to
determine whether a claimant has, as a matter of fact, satisfied the legal requirements for ICSID
jurisdiction that are set by the applicable BIT and the ICSID Convention.

Respondent itself has acknowledged that the jurisdictional requirements for this dispute are
contained in the ICSID Convention and in the applicable BIT. It stated in its Memorial on
Jurisdiction that “The question relating to the competence of this Tribunal consists, therefore, in
determining how a foreign investor may acquire ius standi. The answer to this question may be
found in the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.”””” Furthermore, investment arbitration case law
on this point is well-documented and consistent’! In BG Group pic v. Argentina, for example,
the tribunal rejected the very argument made here by Respondent. As that tribunal noted:

Argentina’s reliance on principles of domestic corporate law must fail. BG’s
claim is made under the Argentina-UK BIT. BG is an “Investor” who has made
an “Investment” in Argentina within the definition of Article 1(a)(ii) of the treaty.
It is further uncontroverted that BG’s shares in [the local companies] are “assets”
within the meaning ascribed to the term in this award pursuant to Argentine law.
The meaning of the BIT is to be determined not by analogy with private law rules,
but from the words of [the] treaty itself and in the light of the purpose which it
sets out to achieve?”

(b) Respondent’s “Intermediary Investor” Argument

229. In addition to its “derivative claim” arguments, Respondent also argues that the Treaty does not

230.

231.

provide standing to an “indirect” shareholder who only owns shares in the allegedly injured
company through an intermediary (in this case, Air Comet).?”? Respondent suggests that because
Article I(2) does not explicitly refer to investments made “directly or indirectly,” indirectly-held
investments are not protected.

Contrary to Respondent’s assertions, nothing in the broad language of Article 1(2) of the Treaty
suggests that shares held through subsidiaries are excluded from coverage under Article 1(2).
Again, the language of Article I(2) affirmatively extends the definition of protected
“investments” to “any kind of assets” and “property and rights of every kind.” For this reason,
the Tribunal considers that Claimants’ shareholdings in the Argentine Airlines constitute
“investments” under Article I(2).

Moreover, the Tribunal’s conclusion is consistent with previous awards. In Siemens v.
Argentina, which concerned a BIT with language very similar to Article I(2) of the Treaty, the
tribunal conducted a close textual analysis of the relevant treaty provision that is instructive to
the present dispute. The claimant in Siemens was a German investor who held shares in an
intermediary company, which in turn held shares in a local company. The tribunal concluded
that the claimant’s investment was covered by the BIT, using the following reasoning:

The Tribunal has conducted a detailed analysis of the references in the Treaty to
“investment” and “investor.” The Tribunal observes that there is no explicit
reference to direct or indirect investment as such in the Treaty. The definition of
“investment” is very broad. An investment is any kind of asset considered to be

 

Jurisdiction, at 4/31 (“Argentina in its allegations has not distinguished between the law applicable to the merits of
the dispute and the law applicable to determine the Tribunal's jurisdiction. This being an ICSID Tribunal, its
jurisdiction is governed by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the terms of the instrument expressing the
parties’ consent to ICSID arbitration, namely, Article 10 of the Treaty.”).

°° BG Group ple v Argentine Republic, UNCITRAL, Final Award, December 24, 2007, §{| 203-04, Exhibit C-340.
Note, that the Final Award rendered by the Tribunal was subsequently denied enforcement on different grounds by
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The D.C. Circuit decided the appeal on the
basis of arbitrability, finding that BG and Argentina had not agreed to submit the arbitrability question itself to
arbitration, and that the BG tribunal did not have jurisdiction to consider the matter of its own competence. See
Republic of Argentina v. BG Group ple, D.C. Cir., No. 11-7021 (January 17, 2012).

such under the law of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made.
The specific categories of investment included in the definition are included as
examples rather than with the purpose of excluding those not listed. The drafters
were careful to use the words “not exclusively” before listing the categories of
“particularly” included investments. One of the categories consists of “shares,
rights of participation in companies and other types of participation in
companies.” The plain meaning of this provision is that shares held by a German
shareholder are protected under the Treaty. The Treaty does not require that there
be no interposed companies between the investment and the ultimate owner of the
company. Therefore, a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation
that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.””*

an

investments, even where the BIT does not explicitly refer to “directly or indirectly” held
investments. For example, the tribunals in Kardassopoulos v. Georgia??> Cemex v.
Venezuela,°® and Mobil v. Venezuela” addressed similar fact patterns and reached similar
conclusions to that in Siemens.

(c) Respondent’s Policy Arguments

In addition to its legal arguments regarding the issue of the “indirectness” of Claimants’
shareholdings, Respondent has advanced a number of policy arguments against Claimants’
standing in this dispute. According to Respondent, the Claimants are upsetting the hierarchy of
creditor claims against the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest, and it is inappropriate to award
damages to a shareholder rather than to the company that has actually suffered injury.
Respondent also expresses its concern that this suit could increase the risk that Respondent could
be subjected to double-payment, because Interinvest could recover through the Argentine Courts
in addition to any recovery by the Claimants under the Treaty.

Respondent’s assertions could have relevance in the merits proceeding of this case, but
Respondent fails to demonstrate why these assertions are relevant at the jurisdictional stage.
Moreover, Respondent has failed to articulate why these policy issues, as specifically applied to
the facts at hand, should affect the outcome of this jurisdictional objection. Respondent has not
attempted to demonstrate the extenuating nature of the facts here, or to differentiate the facts in
this case from the large number of other ICSID cases in which claimant shareholders were found
to have standing.

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that Claimants, as indirect shareholders, have standing to recover
for damages that were inflicted upon the companies—i.e., Interinvest and the Argentine

Airlines—in which Claimants invested. The ordinary language of Article I(2) is designed to
protect “all assets”—including indirect shareholdings. The Tribunal also finds that Claimants
are not deprived of standing by the fact that their investments were made through their
subsidiary, Air Comet.

ii. Claimants’ Other Investments
1. Positions of the Parties

Claimants assert that they have made several qualifying investments under Article I(2) of the
Treaty, and that these investments in Argentina go beyond the ownership and control of “shares
and other forms of participation in companies.”””* Specifically, Claimants assert that they have
also made the following qualifying investments under the Treaty: (a) significant capital
contributions to expand and support the Argentine Airlines’ operations, (b) concessions to
operate in the Argentine airlines sector, (c) investment in management and know-how, (d) rights
relating to aircraft, engines, a flight simulator, etc., and (e) movable and immovable property.””

Respondent disputes that these investments qualify under Article 1(2). Specifically, Respondent
asserts that Claimants have not substantiated by evidence their capital contributions, nor would
such contributions confer any rights other than those vested in shareholders. Respondent
asserts that Claimants do not directly hold concessions to operate in the Argentine airlines sector
and that they did not invest in other property and rights already within the possession of the
Argentine Airlines at the time of investment.*”' Finally, Respondent asserts that Claimants have
not demonstrated that they actually made investments in the Argentine Airlines’ aircrafts, or that
the Argentine Airlines were the recipients of aircrafts ordered by Astra, an Irish subsidiary of
Claimants, nor would these activities constitute qualifying “investments” under the Treaty.*””

2. Analysis of the Tribunal

The Tribunal will not address Claimants’ other alleged investments at this time. The Tribunal
has concluded that Claimants’ indirect shareholdings constitute an “investment” under the
Treaty. Consequently, Claimants have standing to bring this dispute. The Tribunal may
consider Claimants’ other alleged investments at the merits stage of these proceedings.

iii. Claimants’ Third-Party Funding Agreement and Assignment of Award
Proceeds

During the hearing on jurisdiction, Respondent raised its concern that Claimants’ and Air
Comet’s recent reorganization proceedings in Spain could affect Claimants’ authorization to
bring this case°* In its post-hearing submissions, Respondent has also questioned two

S

agreements entered into by Claimants subsequent to commencing this arbitration. One of these,
a Credit Assignment Agreement among Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses
Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee (the “Assignment Agreement”), dated
January 18, 2010, concerned the assignment to Air Comet of the proceeds of a potential award in
this arbitration. The other, a Funding Agreement made between Claimants and Burford Capital
Limited, an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, and effective as of April 14, 2010
(the “Funding Agreement”), concerned the financing of Claimants’ litigation expenses in this
arbitration.

The Parties do not dispute that Air Comet commenced voluntary reorganization proceedings on
April 20, 2010. Nor do they dispute that the Claimants each commenced voluntary
reorganization roughly a year later, with Teinver on December 23, 2010, Autobuses Urbanos on
January 28, 2011, and Transportes de Cercanias on February 16, 2011.°°°

The Parties also acknowledge that Claimants concluded the Assignment Agreement, by which
Claimants agreed to assign to Air Comet proceeds of an eventual award in this case.°° In
addition, the Parties acknowledge that Claimants executed the Funding Agreement with
Burford.*°’ However, the Parties disagree as to the effects of these agreements on Claimants’
standing in this case.

1. Position of Respondent

As a procedural matter, Respondent asserts that Claimants concealed their reorganization
proceedings as late as April 12, 2011, and that Claimants were under a duty to make registration
documents and court filings available to the Tribunal and Respondent.

Respondent asserts that Claimants’ assignment to Air Comet of proceeds from an eventual award
in this case was “fraudulent,” because it was made on a date “suspiciously close” to Air Comet’s
reorganization, and “gratuitous,” because it was not backed by consideration.” Respondent
asserts that Claimants should have notified Respondent as the alleged debtor of the agreement.*!°
Moreover, Respondent argues that the agreement contravenes Spanish public policy on
collection preferences, and that consequently the parties to the agreement were required to obtain
judicial authorization from the Spanish courts in order to proceed.*"!

As for the assignment itself, Respondent maintains that Claimants assigned to Air Comet a right
they never owned, because Claimants themselves lack jurisdiction to bring this dispute and claim
a remedy. Such an assignment would violate the general principle of law under which “a person

can transfer no greater right than he owns[.]”*'? Moreover, Claimants’ lack of standing is clear
in light of the very text of the assignment to Air Comet and related court-filed writings, which
note that “AIR COMET is the one that is in fact affected by the expropriation since it owns
100% of Interinvest S.A., which in turn owns 100% of Aerolineas Argentinas’ shares...”*!>

Regarding Claimants’ Funding Agreement with Burford, Respondent asserts that it is Burford,
and not Claimants, that is the real party interested in this arbitration. According to Respondent,
Burford has “not only invoked that it holds a purported “common legal interest” with the
Claimants in this proceeding, but it is also the only party that would seem to be potentially
benefited in the case of a hypothetical award against Argentina in the instant case.”*!

According to Respondent, Burford does not meet the basic jurisdictional requirements under the
ICSID Convention. Burford is not an investor in Argentina, nor is it a company organized in
Spain that could invoke the Treaty relied upon by Claimants to institute this arbitration
proceeding.*!> Thus, allowing Burford to benefit from a dispute settlement mechanism
authorized under the Treaty is contrary to the object and purpose of the latter, and would
impermissibly bypass the limits of Argentina’s and Spain’s consent to arbitral jurisdiction.*"°

2. Position of Claimants

Claimants contest Respondent’s assertion that Claimants have purposefully concealed
information from this Tribunal regarding the voluntary reorganizations. Claimants assert that
they have disclosed in good faith all relevant facts during this arbitration proceeding, and that the
allegedly “concealed” reorganizations have no bearing on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Likewise,
the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement are irrelevant to the question of the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal.*!”

According to Claimants, Respondent’s assertions are misplaced for the following reasons: (i)
Claimants’ standing to bring this arbitration is exclusively governed by the ICSID Convention
and the Treaty; (ii) under the ICSID Convention, the Treaty and international law, the relevant
date for the purposes of determining the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is the date of the institution of the
proceedings; and (iii) both the Spanish reorganization proceedings and the Assignment
Agreement post-date the institution of the proceedings.*'*

Claimants emphasize that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention defines “national of another
contracting state” as “any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such
dispute to conciliation or arbitration”*"” According to Claimants, this principle has been firmly

established by ICSID tribunals, and moreover, is a firmly established rule in international
adjudication.”

Claimants note that consent was perfected on November 20, 2008, that the Request for
Arbitration was filed on December 11, 2008, and that registration of their Request by ICSID took
place on January 30, 2009. No events between those dates would affect the Claimants’ standing
in these proceedings.*! Each of Respondent's allegations occurred after the institution of these
proceedings, and is therefore irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction. Specifically, the Assignment
Agreement between Claimants and Air Comet was executed January 18, 2010. The Funding
Agreement between Claimants and Burford took effect on April 14, 2010. Claimants’ Spanish
reorganization proceedings occurred starting in late December, 2010.

With respect to Claimants’ Spanish reorganization proceedings, Claimants note that these
proceedings were voluntarily initiated, and that Claimants have kept the administration and
disposition powers over their assets. Claimants assert that under Spanish law, they do not
need the express authorization of their respective reorganization administrators to continue any
arbitration proceedings, including the instant one before ICSID, unless they were to withdraw, to
accept a counter-claim, or to settle the dispute." Nonetheless, their respective reorganization
administrators have provided letters demonstrating their knowledge and acquiescence to continue
this arbitration.

Claimants argue that their assignment of the rights of the net proceeds of this arbitration to Air
Comet has no bearing on Claimants’ standing to bring this arbitration. The Assignment
Agreement is a valid transaction which remains in full force and effect. Even if the Assignment
Agreement was declared null and void, such circumstance would not undermine Claimants’
standing to bring the present claim against Argentina. Claimants’ position as Argentina’s
creditor would remain unaltered, and Air Comet would be the only one affected by the
declaration of nullity.*?°

Furthermore, Claimants argue that Respondent incorrectly characterizes the Air Comet
assignment as an “assignment of a claim.” In fact, Claimants have executed an assignment of the
rights to the net proceeds that may be obtained from an eventual award against Argentina.
Claimants remain the legal holders of the claim against Argentina.”° Under the assignment, Air
Comet is to receive any proceeds that may remain after deducting all payments.*””

Finally, with respect to the Burford Funding Agreement, Claimants submit that Burford is not a
party to the arbitration. The Claimants did not sell or transfer the claim to Burford. Rather,
Burford funds the arbitration in exchange for a percentage of the recovery in the case of a
successful claim. Such financing agreements are frequently made, and Respondent has pointed

to no investment award or decision finding third-party funding to be illegitimate, unlawful or
inappropriate.***

3. Analysis of the Tribunal
(a) Existence of Jurisdiction

First, international case law has consistently determined that jurisdiction is generally to be
assessed as of the date the case is filed:

- The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its jurisdiction must
be determined at the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed. Thus, if
the Court has jurisdiction on the date the case is referred to it, it continues to do so
regardless of subsequent events.”

- [I]t is generally recognized that the determination of whether a party has standing
in an international judicial forum, for purposes of jurisdiction to institute
proceedings, is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are
deemed to have been instituted. ... This is not only a principle of ICSID
proceedings, it is an accepted principle of international adjudication that
jurisdiction will be determined in the light of the situation as it existed on the date
the proceedings were instituted. Events that take place before that date may affect
jurisdiction; events that take place after that date do not. The ICJ developed
cogent case law to this effect in the Lockerbie case. (...) The consequence of this
tule is that, once established, jurisdiction cannot be defeated. It simply is not
affected by subsequent events. Events occurring after the institution of
proceedings (...) cannot withdraw the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the dispute.”

Second, to the extent that Respondent’s standing argument is based on the assertion that
Claimants transferred their rights or interests in this case to Burford after initiating this
arbitration, this argument is unavailing. As Schreuer notes, “ICSID Tribunals have applied [the
principle that jurisdiction is determined as of the date of filing] consistently. In some cases the
claimants had divested themselves of or had transferred the rights that had given rise to the
dispute after the institution of proceedings. Tribunals have rejected the argument that, as a
consequence, claimants in the proceedings were no longer the real parties in interest.”**! In
CSOB v. Slovakia, the claimant had, subsequently to filing the arbitration, assigned its arbitral
claims against the respondent to a third party. The tribunal in CSOB held that

Commentary, Ex. C-761 at 92 (“It is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be
determined by reference to the date on which the judicial proceedings are instituted. This means that on that date all
jurisdictional requirements must be met. It also means that events taking place after that date will not affect
jurisdiction.”).

258.

it is generally recognized that the determination whether a party has standing in
an international judicial forum for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings
is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have
been instituted. Since the Claimant instituted these proceedings prior to the time
when the two assignments were concluded, it follows that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction to hear this case regardless of the legal effect, if any, the assignments
might have had on Claimant’s standing had they preceded the filing of the case.*”

Third, to the extent that Respondent’s characterization of the Assignment Agreement as
“fraudulent” implies that Claimants committed illegalities under Spanish law with respect to the
performance of their investment, this argument is similarly unavailing. In Hamester v. Ghana,
the respondent argued that claimant had committed illegalities in the performance of the
investment.**? Like the Treaty, the BIT in Hamester required the investment to be legally
acquired. However, the Tribunal found that subsequent illegality did not affect its jurisdiction
over claimant’s dispute.

Respondent has not countered these cases with any opposing case law, nor has it seriously sought
to distinguish the facts in the current dispute. As a factual matter, Respondent does not contest
Claimants’ assertion that consent to this arbitration was perfected on November 20, 2008, that
the Request for Arbitration was filed on December 11, 2008, and that registration took place on
January 30, 2009. Nor does Respondent assert that any of the events it alludes to occurred prior
to this time. Ordered chronologically, the subsequent events referred to by Respondent in its
pleadings occurred as follows:

proceedings of an award under this arbitration from Claimants to Air Comet

life or performance of the investment is not addressed in Article 10. It follows that this does not bear upon the scope
of application of the BIT (and hence this Tribunal’s jurisdiction) — albeit that it may well be relevant in the context
of the substantive merits of a claim brought under the BIT. Thus, on the wording of this BIT, the legality of the
creation of the investment is a jurisdictional issue; the legality of the investor’s conduct during the life of the
investment is a merits issue. Therefore, in this first step of the analysis of the case relating to jurisdiction, the
Tribunal is only concerned with allegations of fraud in the initiation of the investment, and not with the multiple
allegations of fraudulent conduct during the life of the investment. . . .”).

Based on the fact that each of the allegations made by Respondent concerns an event—the
Claimants’ reorganizations, the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement—that post-
dates the filing of the arbitration, the Tribunal finds this sufficient grounds to reject Respondents’
objection. The Tribunal will not address Respondent’s remaining allegations regarding the
Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement as they concern Claimants’ standing,
without prejudice to further submissions by the Parties in respect of the Respondent’s allegations
in so far as they affect the merits of Claimants’ claims, as appropriate, during the merits stage.

d. Third Jurisdictional Objection: Issues of State Attribution

In their Memorial on the Merits, Claimants have asserted that the administration of Argentine
President Nestor Kirchner was “hostile towards Claimants’ management of the Argentine
Airlines and seemed driven by a desire to ultimately “re-Argentinize” the companies.”**
Claimants assert that the administration took a number of measures that destabilized the legal
and business environment surrounding Claimants’ investment.>°°

In particular, Claimants highlight President Kirchner’s appointment of Mr. Ricardo Cirielli as
Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Claimants describe Mr. Cirielli as a powerful union leader
who had a record—both before and after his appointment—of being openly critical of Claimants’
management of the Argentine Airlines.*” Claimants assert, moreover, that during his
appointment as Undersecretary of Air Transportation, Mr. Cirielli repeatedly lent his support to
the unions and spoke out against airfare increases requested by the Argentine Airlines.

Claimants also assert that the Government of Argentina “implicitly support[ed]” strikes
organized by the Argentine Aeronautical Technical Staff Association (“APTA”) and the
Argentine Airline Pilots Association (“APLA”)8 Claimants point to a 9-day strike that was
organized by APLA and APTA in November 2005. Claimants allege that this strike severely
affected the Argentine Airlines generally and ARSA in particular, affecting around 95,000
passengers, causing nearly 380 flights to be suspended and causing a loss of approximately
US$12 million to the Argentine Airlines.*”

i. Position of Respondent

Respondent argues that Claimants have attempted to attribute responsibility to Respondent for
acts by non-state entities. According to Respondent, Claimants make the following allegations:

1) that Respondent is responsible under international law for the acts of two Argentine labor
unions, APTA and APLA; 2) that Respondent is responsible under international law for the acts
of these unions because they were coordinated by Mr. Ricardo Cirielli to commit acts
detrimental to the Argentine Airlines and thus force the nationalization of the companies; and 3)
that Respondent is responsible for the acts of Mr. Cirielli before he took office as Undersecretary
of Air Transportation in Argentina.*“°

Respondent asserts that it is not responsible for the acts of the two unions, which are not state
organs and do not exercise governmental authority or act on the instructions or under the
direction or control of Respondent.*' Under international law, a labor union is neither a “State
organ” nor does it exercise elements of “governmental authority” as defined in Articles 4 and 5
of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International
Law Commission (“ILC Articles”)? Nor have Claimants met the test of attribution set forth in
Article 8 of the ILC Articles. Claimants have failed to prove the existence of an instruction or
order by Respondent to individuals or entities or the existence of the effective control by the
Government over them. Moreover, the “overall control” standard relied on by Claimants is
inappropriate to use as a standard here.** In any case, the evidence submitted by Claimants in
these proceedings does not even rise to the level of satisfying the “overall control” standard.**°

Respondent also argues that the acts committed by Mr. Cirielli prior to his appointment as
Undersecretary or following his period in public office cannot be attributed to the Argentine
Government.*** Moreover, while Claimants also seek to attribute responsibility for the acts
committed by Mr. Cirielli as a public officer based on the control that he allegedly exerted over
the labor unions, Claimants do not point out any act giving rise to the responsibility of States.*4”
The fact that Mr. Cirielli was the Secretary General of APTA before and after becoming a public
officer does not mean that APTA’s actions can be attributed to him.*“*

Finally, according to Respondent, the issue of attribution of responsibility under international
law is jurisdictional in nature.*? Claimants must prove that they have a prima facie case of
attribution of responsibility in order for the subject-matter of the attribution to be argued on the
merits of the case.**’ According to Respondent, case law has held that it is more appropriate to
examine this question at the jurisdictional stage where it becomes apparent that the State is not
involved at all or where the question of attribution may be resolved on the basis of a preliminary
analysis. This is exactly the case here.**!

ii. Position of Claimants

Claimants assert that questions of state attribution should be decided in the merits phase of this
arbitration.’ Several investment law awards have held that whether state attribution is a
question of jurisdiction or of merits is not clear-cut, and depends on the given case. Here,
because the question of state attribution is closely intermingled with the merits, and because it
requires an in-depth analysis of the complex relationships between certain acts and the state, it is
appropriate to resolve these issues during the merits phase.*™*

In the alternative, Claimants argue that the acts of the unions are attributable to Respondent.
There is ample evidence that in various instances, APTA and APLA acted “on the instructions or
under the direction or control” of Respondent. Respondent maintains that the acts of the
unions can only be attributable to the GOA if the government exercised “effective control” over
them. Some tribunals have, however, rejected this “effective control” test in favor of an “overall
control” test, including the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia and the European Court of Human Rights.**° Claimants assert that there is
ample evidence that Respondent exerted overall control over the unions, especially through Mr.
Cirielli*’ By appointing Mr. Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation while allowing
him to simultaneously retain a position as union leader, Respondent created the situation of
control over the union.*** Respondent also, at least implicitly, supported strikes organized by
APLA and APTA, including strikes in November 2005, September and October 2007, and
January 2008, which caused the Argentine Airlines significant harm.*”

Claimants assert that they do not currently seek to attribute to Respondent acts by Mr. Cirielli
made prior to his appointment as Undersecretary. Claimants simply seek to demonstrate that
the Argentine Government knowingly appointed and kept in office an Undersecretary of Air
Transportation who had previously served as the Secretary General of the powerful APTA union
and who was openly hostile to Claimants’ management of the Argentine Airlines as an element
of their allegations of unfair treatment under the Treaty at the hands of the Respondent.**!
Moreover, Respondent does not dispute that the acts by Mr. Cirielli during his tenure as
Undersecretary are attributable to Respondent.’ Citing Article 4 of the ILC Articles, Claimants
assert that such acts are attributable to Respondent, even if they amount to an abuse of power.

iii. Analysis of the Tribunal

270. The Tribunal notes that Respondent has not asserted that none of the acts alleged in Claimants’

271.

272.

N

Memorial on the Merits are attributable to the Argentine Government. Rather, Respondent’s
arguments in this regard concern only whether certain alleged acts committed by two Argentine
labor unions and by the Argentine Undersecretary of Air Transportation may be attributed to the
State.

While Respondent asserts that substantial case law supports its position that the question of
attribution is jurisdictional in nature,*™ this case law also recognizes that not all questions of
attribution are identical or involve an identical context. Case law on this subject does support the
conclusion that matters of state attribution should be adjudicated at the jurisdictional stage when
they represent a fairly cut-and-dry issue that will determine whether there is jurisdiction.

For example, the issue before the Maffezini tribunal concerned the question whether the dispute
between the claimant and respondent, a private commercial corporation established by the
Spanish government, constituted an investor-State dispute under the meaning of Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention, or whether it merely constituted a private dispute. The Maffezini tribunal
determined that the question whether the respondent could be considered a state entity was
critical to whether the tribunal could take jurisdiction over the case.“ In CSOB, and also for
purposes of determining whether the dispute constituted an investor-State dispute under Article
25, the tribunal had to determine whether the claimant was a private entity or subject to state
control.

54 Mem. 4] 220.

*6 Maffezini v. Spain, Decision on Jurisdiction, at 4 75. The tribunal noted that the issue of whether the private
commercial corporation was a state entity for purposes of determining the jurisdiction of the Centre and the
competence of the tribunal was necessarily an issue to be decided at the jurisdictional stage of these proceedings.
However, the tribunal noted that the issue of whether the actions and omissions complained of by the claimant were
imputable to the State was an issue that “bears on the merits of the dispute and can be finally resolved only at that
stage.” Id.

5 CSOB y. Slovak Republic, Decision on Jurisdiction, at | 27. In CSOB, the respondent had argued that the
claimant did not meet the requirement of Article 25(1) that a dispute must be between a Contracting State and a
national of another Contracting State. Specifically, the respondent had argued that the dispute was between two
Contracting States because the claimant was purportedly a state agency of the Czech Republic rather than an
independent commercial entity, and because the real party in interest to the dispute was the Czech Republic. The
tribunal concluded, however, that the respondent failed to sustain its contention that the Centre lacked jurisdiction
and the tribunal competence to hear the case on the ground that the claimant was acting as an agent of the State or
discharging essentially governmental activities. See also Hamester v. Ghana, Award, at 141 (“For a jurisdictional
objection to prosper, it has to be such a definitive impediment that the Tribunal has no right to entertain, or enquire
into, the dispute. If, for example, one takes the jurisdictional requirements ratione personae as set out in Article 25
of the ICSID Convention, i.e. that the dispute is a legal dispute between a Contracting State of the ICSID
Convention and investors of another Contracting State, the determinative criteria are clear and easily answered: the
two Parties must respectively be a foreign investor from a Contracting State, and a Contracting State, for jurisdiction
to exist. Here, as jurisdiction depends on the German/Ghana BIT, the Tribunal can deal with a dispute between the
German company Hamester and the Republic of Ghana. In other words, if Hamester was not a German company, or
if the case had been brought against a State other than Ghana, there would evidently have existed a clear
jurisdictional objection. Not all issues, however, are so discrete or easily answered. Many—as is the case with
attribution—entail more complex considerations, which could be characterized both as jurisdictional and relevant to
the merits (and so to be considered only if the Tribunal has jurisdiction). Moreover, each of the alleged acts is
closely connected to the question of whether Respondent has committed substantive violations of the BIT.”).

 

64

273.

274.

275.

Here it is not necessary for the Tribunal to attribute the acts of the unions and Mr. Cirielli to the
Respondent in order for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the dispute. The Claimants allege
actions by Argentine government institutions contrary to the Treaty, whose attribution to the
Respondent is not in dispute. Moreover, the issue of the attribution of the acts by the unions and
Mr. Cirielli is not clear-cut. As the tribunal in Hamester noted:

[I]n many instances, questions of attribution and questions of legality are closely
intermingled, and it is difficult to deal with the question of attribution without a
full enquiry into the merits. In any event, whatever the qualification of the
question of attribution, the Tribunal notes that, as a practical matter, this question
is usually best dealt with at the merits stage, in order to allow for an in-depth
analysis of all the parameters of the complex relationship between certain acts and
the State... This approach — to deal with the question of attribution as a merits
question — is particularly appropriate, in the Tribunal’s view in this case. The
Tribunal is not faced here with a situation where it is readily evident that the State
is not involved at all, or where the issue is capable of an answer based upon a
limited enquiry (akin to other jurisdictional issues).*”

Respondent argues, based on Hamester, that it is clear that Respondent is not involved at all with
these alleged acts, and that this issue can be resolved on a preliminary basis. However, the issue
is not as straight-forward as Respondent asserts.

Claimants’ assertions regarding the unions and Mr. Cirielli are closely connected to their
allegation that Respondent has violated the Treaty. Both sets of assertions concern the difficult
and fact-intensive question of whether the Argentine government tolerated or encouraged or
otherwise supported the union activities in question. In the case of the unions, Claimants assert
that Respondent’s support of the unions was part of its broader goal to renationalize the
Argentine Airlines.** In the case of Mr. Cirielli, Claimants seek to demonstrate that Respondent
knowingly appointed and kept in office an individual who was hostile to the Claimants’ presence
in Argentina.*” If the Tribunal were to resolve these issues at this jurisdictional stage, it would
do so only on the basis of the Parties’ arguments from their jurisdictional pleadings. The
Tribunal would not have the benefit of the Parties’ further pleadings on the merits or any further
evidentiary submissions that may touch upon these issues. Given the fact-intensive nature of
Claimants’ allegations, the Tribunal must postpone adjudication of this issue until the merits
phase. Consequently, Respondent’s jurisdiction objection is rejected.

Given this conclusion, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to address in detail the substance of
Respondent’s arguments regarding attribution. The Tribunal does note, however, that
Respondent has requested the Tribunal to expressly declare that the acts of labor unions are not
attributable to the Argentine Republic under Articles 4 or 5 of the ILC Articles,’”° which address,
respectively, the conduct of organs of a State and of persons or entities that are empowered by

56 Hamester v. Ghana, Award, at {§ 143-45.

276.

277.

the law of that State to exercise elements of government authority. Claimants have responded to
this request, arguing that they do not in fact maintain that the unions fall within Articles 4 or 5 of
the ILC Articles. Rather, to Claimants, the issue is whether they fall within Article 8 of the ILC
Articles,”' which concerns conduct of a person or group acting on the instructions of, or under
the direction or control of a State. Because the two Parties agree that Article 8, and not Articles
4 or 5, would be relevant to the analysis of the unions’ conduct,*” there is no need for this
Tribunal to make any such declaration.*”

Finally, it should be clarified that both Parties agree that the current objection on the attribution
of state acts refers to Mr. Cirielli’s acts before and after his tenure as the Undersecretary of Air
Transportation. While Claimants discuss Mr. Cirielli’s acts during office in their pleadings,>“
this issue was not within the scope of Respondent’s original objection.’ Furthermore,
Claimants assert that they do not seek to attribute liability to Respondent for Mr. Cirielli’s pre-
office acts.*” As such, the Parties do not appear to actually disagree on the issue of attribution
as it concerns Mr. Cirielli’s conduct before and after holding his office.

e Fourth Jurisdictional Objection: The Legality of Claimants’ Investment

i, Position of Respondent

In Respondent’s fourth and final objection, it asserts that Claimants’ investment is not protected
by the Treaty because of alleged illegalities connected to that investment. Specifically,
Respondent asserts that Claimants, by certain actions taken with respect to their investment, have
violated Spanish and Argentine law and have committed other misdeeds.

57 Rej. 4307

5” See also Rep. § 256.

° The Tribunal notes that while the Parties agree that Article 8 of the ILC Articles applies to the unions’ activities,
they remain at odds over the proper interpretation of the term “control” as used in Article 8. As noted above,
Respondent maintains that the rigorous standard of “effective control,” which has been used in Military and
Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States), Merits, Judgment, (“Nicaragua
Merits”) 1.C.J. Reports 1986, § 115, and Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), 2007 ICJ Reports 1, §
396 et seq. (February 26) (LA AR 75), and which is described in the ILC Commentary at Article 8, 4, is the
appropriate legal standard. Claimants maintain, instead, that the proper standard to be applied to the unions is the
less rigorous standard of “overall control,” which has been used in Prosecutor v. Dusko Tadic, International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Case IT-94-1-A (1999), ILM, vol. 38, No. 6 (November 1999), p. 1518, at
1541, § 117 and p. 1546, 4 145, Exhibit C-504; and in Loizidou v. Turkey, Merits, ECHR, Judgment, December 18,

57” The Tribunal notes that the Parties appear to disagree on the legal standard applicable to Mr. Cirielli’s conduct
while in office. Claimants assert that ILC Article 4 is applicable to his acts (CM 4 302, Rej. § 316), while
Respondent suggests that Article 8 should apply (Rep. 4] 279). For the reasons indicated previously, and because
Mr. Cirielli’s conduct while in tenure of his position was not the subject of Respondent’s objection, the Tribunal
declines to address these arguments at this time.

Alleged Violations of Spanish Law

Respondent bases its allegations on a pending proceeding in Spain involving the directors of Air
Comet. Respondent alleges that subject matters of the investigation have a direct impact on and
relation to this arbitration.

Respondent bases its allegations on facts alleged by the Office of the Attorney General in an
ongoing Spanish court investigation of directors of SEPI and Air Comet, involving acts related to
the 2001 Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) between SEPI and Air Comet.*” According to
Respondent, the investigation concerns whether these actors were guilty of misappropriation of
public funds, fraud or illegal exaction, document forgery, fraudulent use of process, and/or
crimes against the federal treasury in connection with the SPA.**°

The SPA, which provided for the transfer of SEPI’s 99.2% shareholding in Interinvest to Air
Comet, was approved by the Spanish Cabinet and was subsequently executed on October 2,
2001. As part of the SPA, SEPI sold to Air Comet S.A. its interest in Interinvest for US$ 1
dollar, while SEPI agreed to transfer $300 million to Interinvest to service ARSA’s liabilities (in
addition to transferring other funds to Air Comet).**' Respondent alleges that instead of
complying with the terms of the SPA, Air Comet used the SEPI funds to buy the existing claims
against ARSA, with Air Comet subrogated as a creditor."

According to Respondent, the defendants in this investigation purportedly have asserted that
SEPI and Air Comet executed a supplemental private agreement, signed on October 15, 2001, in
which the parties agreed that Air Comet would subrogate the claims as described above.
However, the Spanish Office of the Attorney General believes this document may either be a
false document created after its indicated date, or, to the extent it is an authentic document, it
concems conduct that deviates from that which was authorized in the SPA by the Spanish
Cabinet.

Respondent alleges that Air Comet committed tax fraud in connection with its subrogation of
ARSA’s debt claims. Respondent asserts that Air Comet failed to declare its subrogation for tax
purposes, even though it created a taxable event under Spanish law when it acquired claims
against ARSA.*™ According to Respondent, several of the defendants in the proceeding have
already made court statements and the State Agency of the Tax Administration has issued an
expert report.”

Respondent notes that the Spanish Central Court for Investigative Proceedings No. 6 of Madrid
concluded on September 7, 2011 that the investigations in this proceeding allow the inference
that Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias and Mata Romayo were involved in conduct that could be

“presumably and initially qualified as a crime against the Treasury Department committed by Air
Comet.”**° Respondent also notes that the Prosecution of the Spanish National Court has
requested a penalty of imprisonment for Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias and Mr. Antonio
Mata Ramayo, along with a joint compensation amounting to 99 million euros.**”

In addition to this investigation, Respondent notes a number of “new developments” as of March
26, 2012 in pending Spanish criminal proceedings that directly involve Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr.
Pascual Arias.***

First, Respondent notes that the Central Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 1 of Madrid
admitted a criminal investigation proceeding on February 2, 2012 against Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr.
Pascual Arias and Mr. Ivan Losada (administrator of Teinver S.L.) in connection with their
management of Viajes Marsans.**”

Second, Respondent notes that Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias are being investigated in
another proceeding by the Spanish National Court in connection with the potential commission
of procedural fraud. According to Respondent, the two men alle; llegedly submitted false
documentation to a judge in order to obtain an unfair judicial resolution.*

Third, Respondent notes that one of the Marsans Group’s creditors has brought a criminal action
against Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias, Mr. Ivan Losada and Mr. Angel de Cabo in the
Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 8 of Madrid, concerning their actions with respect to
insolvency proceedings. According to Respondent, Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias sold
their companies to Possibilitum Business, controlled by Mr. de Cabo, which had engaged in
illegal activities in the course of reorganization proceedings.

Fourth, Respondent points to a proceeding pending before Commercial Court No. 12 of Madrid,
and notes that the Province of Madrid’s Prosecutor (Economic Crimes Section) has requested the
court that Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias and Possibilitum Business be declared guilty with
respect to acts taken as the de facto and de jure administrators in the reorganization of Viajes
Marsans S.A., Viajes Crisol S.A.U., Rural Tours S.A.U. and Tiempo Libre S.A.U.5”?

Fifth, Respondent notes that the Commercial Court No. 9 of Madrid found Mr. Diaz Ferran and
Mr. Pascual Arias “guilty of the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio S.A.”°°> Respondent notes that
the court also found Teinver and other Marsans Group companies “liable as accomplices to the
bankruptcy.”°** Specifically, Teinver and the other companies directly took part in transactions,

Alleged Violations of Argentine Law

Respondent notes that Air Comet was engaged in “irregular and fraudulent behavior” during the
course of ARSA’s reorganization proceedings.*°° Respondent asserts that during the
reorganization proceedings, Air Comet was both the controlling company of the airline and its
main creditor, thereby acting in an impermissible double role under Argentine law.*””

Respondent also notes that a criminal investigation has been filed in the Argentine courts against
Antonio Mata Ramayo, Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias and others, as directors of ARSA, regarding
the “fraudulent administration” of the company.°* The investigation comprises several
components. First, and similar to the Spanish investigation above, the subjects of investigation
have been charged with causing Air Comet’s fraudulent diversion of SEPI funds intended to
settle ARSA’s liabilities.°°? Second, the investigation concerns ARSA’s December 31, 2001
balance sheet, which allegedly included bogus entries regarding SEPI’s alleged capital
contribution of ARS 1.238 million in 2001. Respondent asserts that these bogus entries resulted
in the dilution of the Argentine State’s shares in the airlines, reducing its participation below the
minimum legal threshold for active participation as a shareholder.’ Third, the investigation
concerns possible crimes committed by Mr. Mata and others in relation to Air Comet’s
subrogation of claims previously held by third-party creditors. Allegedly, Air Comet re-assigned
these claims to another company, Royal Romana Playa S.A., for valuable consideration,
allowing the latter to cast a vote in ARSA’s reorganization plan.*”!

Finally, Respondent asserts that it is irrelevant that the Commercial Court of Buenos Aires ended
ARSA’s reorganization proceedings on June 17, 2011. The termination of those proceedings
does not demonstrate that Claimants committed no illegalities with respect to ARSA’s
reorganization, and indeed, the criminal investigations in Spain and Argentina are ongoing with
respect to Claimants’ fraudulent conduct and irregularities in connection with ARSA.*

Other Alleged Misdeeds

Respondent also points to a number of “issues” with the business management of the Grupo
Marsans and of the Argentine Airlines. Respondent characterizes Marsans’ management
worldwide as “deplorable,” noting that Air Comet’s operations halted in 2009, that a number of
writs of attachment have been issued against Marsans’ owners, Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias,
that other legal suits that have been brought against certain Marsans affiliates, and that certain

Marsans affiliates are undergoing reorganization.’ Respondent also notes “accounting
irregularities” in the Argentine Airlines, including the commingling of assets.*”°

The Relevant Inquiry of Legality for Purposes of Jurisdiction

Respondent asserts that the Treaty only protects investments that were made and carried out in
accordance with the laws of the host state.°° The purpose of Article I(2), which defines
“investments,” is to prevent the Treaty from protecting investments that should not be
protected.*”” Moreover, there is consensus within international investment law that fraud is
prohibited according to good practices and international public policy.

Respondent does not believe that the jurisdictional issue solely concerns whether the investments
were made in accordance with Argentine law; this interpretation leads to results contrary to the
object and purpose of the Treaty.*” If the investment’s inception was the only relevant criterion
at the jurisdictional stage, this would lead to an absurd situation in which transactions that were
made legally, but were followed by “an everlasting series of illegal acts” following their creation,
nonetheless still benefit from the Treaty’s protections.*"° Moreover, it would be necessary to
consider the time at which each investment was made, which would be infeasible in most
disputes in which there are numerous investment transactions involved.*!

Respondent asserts that even if the jurisdictional test is limited to the time of the investment’s
inception (here, the acquisition by Air Comet of Interinvest), the Tribunal is not limited to
assessing only the formal act of executing the SPA.*" Rather, the Tribunal must take account of
the whole complex transaction leading to the “inception” of the investment, which includes both
the execution of the SPA and the breach of or compliance with its terms.*"?

Finally, Respondent notes that even though this Tribunal is not bound by the conclusions made
by local authorities, they may be of “substantial assistance” for the Tribunal to determine the
legality of Claimants’ investments.*'* Furthermore, the “presumption of innocence” criminal
law standard cannot be imputed into the context of international investment law, as Claimants
have argued.*!5

Good Faith

As a final argument, Respondent asserts that an investment that “deliberately runs afoul of the
law of the state” cannot be considered to have been made in good faith.*'® Respondent points to
Claimants’ alleged breach of good faith in Air Comet’s subrogation of ARSA’s creditors’ claims
and in Air Comet’s failure to declare this subrogation to the Spanish authorities due to its
character as a taxable event.'’ Respondent also accuses the Grupo Marsans of ignoring good
faith principles “in multiple jurisdictions.”*"*

ii. Position of Claimants

Claimants argue that Respondent has failed to establish that Claimants’ investments do not
conform to Argentine or Spanish law. According to Claimants, Respondent’s allegations of
illegality are “meritless.”*"” The mere existence of investigations in Spain and Argentina
regarding Claimants’ investments does not provide grounds for the Tribunal to deny
jurisdiction.” Moreover, Respondent fails to demonstrate how the issues at play in the Spanish
investigation would render Claimants’ acquisition of its investment illegal under Argentine
law.”! Claimants assert that, in any event, the Treaty only requires that the investment be in
conformity with the host State’s law at the time of the initiation of the investment, which it did.

Alleged Violations of Spanish Law

According to Claimants, the Spanish legal investigations are not relevant to the jurisdictional
inquiry because they do not concern Claimants’ acquisition of their participation in the
Argentine Airlines. Respondent has not claimed that Claimants made their acquisition through,
for example, an act of corruption or fraud.*”? Instead, the Spanish investigations concern 1)
whether, in the performance of the SPA, SEPI should have requested prior consent of the
Spanish Cabinet before allowing Air Comet to subrogate the rights of ARSA creditors,*”* and 2)
whether Air Comet should have considered the acquisition of those credits for purposes of
corporate income tax.”

Moreover, Claimants assert that Air Comet properly used the funds provided by SEPI,*? and it
did so with SEPI’s consent.*”° Claimants state that Respondent is also mistaken in its allegation
that Air Comet gratuitously increased its patrimony with SEPI funds while failing to add them to
its asset base for Spanish corporate tax purposes. Those credits against ARSA never actually
entered into Air Comet’s patrimony. Air Comet acted in accordance with the SPA and the

a

December 2001 Agreement in using SEPI’s funds in direct benefit of ARSA’s shareholder
(Interinvest), which in return capitalized the credits, increasing its stockholding in ARSA and
reducing the airline’s debt.””

Claimants argue that the “mere existence” of the investigations and court proceedings in Spain
and Argentina is insufficient to demonstrate an illegality.°* Claimants note that even if a
Spanish or Argentine court was to render a decision finding that Claimants had breached
domestic law when making their investments, such a decision would not be binding on this
Tribunal.” Respondent must prove its allegations of illegality before this Tribunal.

More specifically, Claimants disagree with Respondent regarding the contents of the September
7, 2011 Spanish court order. Claimants assert that the order did not make a final determination
that crimes had been committed.*” Rather, the court decided to continue with its investigation
based on its finding that a crime may have been committed against the Spanish Treasury with
respect to Air Comet’s Spanish corporate income tax for 2002."°! In that same order, however,
the court also ordered the dismissal of every other accusation against Air Comet and the other
individuals, including Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, which included the crimes of falsification,
unlawful exaction, procedural fraud, and misappropriation of public funds.” With respect to the
alleged crimes against the Spanish Treasury, there has been no decision on the preliminary
investigation.

According to Claimants, even assuming that Respondent had provided sufficient legal and
factual elements for the Tribunal to find a violation of Spanish law, it fails to demonstrate how
such breaches of Spanish law could amount to breaches under Argentine law, which is the only
standard under the Treaty (Art. 1(2)).44

With respect to the “new developments” alleged by Respondent, Claimants assert that these
developments have no bearing on either the inception of Claimants’ investment or on Argentine
law, and that in any case, these developments consist of “mere allegations.”**°

First, with respect to the proceedings at the Central Court for Investigation Proceedings No.1 of
Madrid regarding the alleged embezzlement by Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias and Mr. Ivan
Losada, Claimants assert that these proceedings are totally unrelated to the jurisdiction of this
Tribunal and to the subject matter of the arbitration.**°

Second, with respect to the procedural fraud claims, Claimants deny the validity of the claims as
well as Respondent’s purportedly unsupported conclusions.**”

Third, with respect to the investigation concerning the legality of operations within the
reorganization proceedings pending before the Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 8 of
Madrid, Claimants assert that neither the claims nor the reorganizations themselves have any
bearing on the present arbitration.***

Fourth, concerning the reorganization proceeding pending before Commercial Court No. 12 of
Madrid, Claimants assert that this proceeding is irrelevant to the present arbitration. Moreover,
the Prosecutor’s petition has been opposed by the interested parties and no decision has yet been
5 439

issued.

Fifth, Claimants address the Commercial Court No. 9 of Madrid’s findings that Gerardo Diaz
Ferran and Gonzalo Pascual Arias were “guilty of the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio, S.A.”
and that Teinver and other Marsans Group companies were liable as accomplices. Claimants
assert that the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio S.A. is “unrelated to Claimants’ second request
for provisional measures, the jurisdiction of this tribunal, or even the subject matter of these
proceedings.“ Moreover, the Court’s May 11, 2012 decision is not final, and Claimants
understand that such appeal will be filed in due course.

Alleged Violations of Argentine Law

Claimants assert that Argentine investigations into fraudulent management are groundless. First,
Claimants state that the funds obtained from SEPI were properly used and directly or indirectly
resulted in a benefit to ARSA and AUSA.“” Second, Claimants note that Respondent did not
disapprove of ARSA’s 2001 balance sheets, and that Respondent’s participation levels shrank
after it failed to make the necessary contributions to maintain its participation at prior levels.*
Claimants note that the Argentine proceedings remain at the preliminary investigation stage.**

Claimants also assert that Air Comet fully complied with the Argentine Bankruptcy Law with
respect to the reorganization of ARSA.“° The majority of ARSA’s trustees approved the
settlement agreement between ARSA and its creditors, and this settlement was subsequently
approved by the responsible Argentine court.“° Furthermore, the Commercial Court of Buenos
Aires ended ARSA’s reorganization proceedings on June 17, 2011. The court made no finding
that Claimants, Air Comet or Interinvest had committed irregularities or illegalities during the

reorganization. This decision therefore confirms that Respondent’s accusations of
“irregularities” in the context of ARSA’s reorganization are groundless.**”

Other Alleged Misdeeds

Claimants respond that Respondent has failed to demonstrate the relevance of the bankruptcy
proceedings or of the other circumstances surrounding Grupo Marsans’ financial difficulties.“*
Furthermore, Claimants assert that it was Respondent’s own failure to grant prompt and adequate
compensation and to observe its commitments that severely impacted Claimants’ group of
companies.

The Relevant Inquiry of Legality for Purposes of Jurisdiction

Claimants assert that the Treaty only requires that the investment conform to law of the host
State at the time it was “acquired or effected.’ In other words, the analysis of the Tribunal at
this stage must focus on the initiation of the investment. This assertion is also confirmed by
relevant case law.**! Claimants note that Respondent has not denied that Air Comet prevailed at
the SEPI auction and legally acquired 99.2% shares of Interinvest, and that the SPA is a legal
and binding agreement under Spanish law.*

Respondent’s allegations refer only to the performance, rather than the inception, of Claimants’
investment.*** But Respondent has failed to provide any authority in support of its assertion that
an investment must conform to the host state’s law throughout the course of its operation and not
just at the time of its commencement in order for it to fall within the protection of the Treaty. If
such a requirement existed, almost any investment could be disqualified from Treaty coverage by
pointing to technical violations of local law in the operation of the investment.*4 Furthermore,
as described above, Respondent has failed to substantiate its allegations on non-performance.***

Good Faith

Claimants assert that Respondent has not provided evidence that Claimants acted in bad faith at
the time of making the investment (or later).4°° Unlike the case law cited by Respondent, there is
no evidence of fraud on the part of Claimants at the time of the making of their investment, nor is
there evidence that Claimants have attempted to gain access to an ICSID arbitration procedure to
which they would not otherwise have been entitled.**” Respondent has simply repeated certain

allegations such as the allegation that Air Comet purportedly committed tax fraud under Spanish
law in its acquisition of liabilities of ARSA.***

iii. Analysis of the Tribunal

The Parties disagree on two initial legal issues regarding the above allegations. First, they
disagree over whether, under the Treaty and international investment law, all illegalities
committed by investors in connection with an investment can deprive the investor of protection
under the Treaty, or only illegalities that are related to the inception of the investment. Second,
the Parties disagree on whether, as a factual matter, the illegalities alleged to have been
committed by the Claimants occurred at the “inception” of the investment or at a subsequent
time.

1. Timing of the Alleged Illegality

As Respondent notes, it is widely acknowledged in investment law that the protections of the
ICSID dispute settlement mechanism should not extend to investments made illegally. As noted
recently by the tribunal in Hamester v. Ghana,

An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national
or international principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful
conduct; or if its creation itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international
investment protection under the ICSID Convention. It will also not be protected if
it is made in violation of the host State’s law (as elaborated, e.g. by the tribunal in
Phoenix).

However, as the Treaty itself makes clear, the critical time period for determining an
investment’s legality is the time the investment was made. Articles 1(2), II and III(1) of the
Treaty address qualifying investments made by investors. Article I(2) defines “investments” as
follows:

The term “investments” shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights
of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the
country receiving the investment{.] (emphasis added)

The application of ordinary meaning of Article I(2) to the Claimants is perfectly straightforward:
in order to qualify as an “investment” under the Treaty, Claimants’ investments must have been
acquired or effected in accordance with Argentine law, the country receiving the investment. In
other words, the relevant inquiry is whether Claimants’ entry into the investment, here its
acquisition of shares in Interinvest through Air Comet, is legal.

Other provisions of the Treaty support this interpretation. Article II(1), which concerns the
promotion and acceptance of investments, states that “[e]Jach Party shall encourage, to the extent

possible, investments made in its territory by investors of the other Party and shall accept those

ay.

321.

32!

S

N

investments in accordance with its legislation.” (emphasis added) Article III(1), which addresses
the protection of investments, requires each party to “protect within its territory investments
made, in accordance with its legislation, or the investors of the other Party[.]” (emphasis added).

Case law addressing BITs with similar language also supports this interpretation. The Germany-
Ghana BIT at issue in Hamester contained similar language to the Treaty, and the tribunal ruled
that only the inception of the investment was relevant for its jurisdictional inquiry:

The Tribunal considers that a distinction has to be drawn between (1) legality as
at the initiation of the investment (“made”) and (2) legality during the
performance of the investment. Article 10 legislates for the scope of application
of the BIT, but conditions this only by reference to legality at the initiation of the
investment. Hence, only this issue bears upon this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Legality in the subsequent life or performance of the investment is not addressed
in Article 10. It follows that this does not bear upon the scope of application of
the BIT (and hence this Tribunal’s jurisdiction) — albeit that it may well be
relevant in the context of the substantive merits of a claim brought under the BIT.
Thus, on the wording of this BIT, the legality of the creation of the investment is a
jurisdictional issue; the legality of the investor’s conduct during the life of the
investment is a merits issue.

Similarly in Fraport, the respondent in that dispute had asserted that in order for the claimant to
maintain jurisdictional standing under the Germany-Philippines BIT, the investment must not
only be in accordance with the domestic law at the commencement of the investment but must
also continually remain in compliance with the domestic law. While the tribunal ultimately
agreed with the respondent that the investment was illegally acquired, **' the tribunal rejected the
respondent’s interpretation regarding the continuation of the investment. It noted,

The language of both Articles 1 and 2 of the BIT emphasizes the initiation of the
investment. Moreover the effective operation of the BIT regime would appear to
require that jurisdictional compliance be limited to the initiation of the
investment. If, at the time of the initiation of the investment, there has been
compliance with the law of the host state, allegations by the host state of
violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a justification for state
action with respect to the investment, might be a defense to claimed substantive
violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority
of the BIT of its jurisdiction.“

Even in Inceysa, a case in which the tribunal determined that the claimants had committed
numerous fraudulent acts, the tribunal’s inquiry was directed towards the inception of the

investment: “[T]Jhe foreign investor cannot seek to benefit from an investment effectuated by
means of one or several illegal acts and, consequently, enjoy the protection granted by the host
state, such as access to international arbitration to resolve disputes, because it is evident that its
act had a fraudulent origin and, as provided by the legal maxim, “nobody can benefit from his
own fraud.“ All of the Inceysa tribunal’s factual findings of fraud concerned the inception of
the investment, including the claimant’s presentation of false information as part of its bid
tender, false representations made during the bidding process, false documents submitted as part
of its bid, and a hidden relationship with another bidder in contravention of the bidding rules."

In addition, the Tribunal notes that the relevant law for purposes of determining whether the
investment was legally made is the law of the host State. Several of Respondent’s arguments
concern allegations of illegality under Spanish law. In support of these arguments, Respondent
asserts that “the general principles that endorse the non-protection of illegal investments or
investments made in bad faith ... are not limited to the law of the host State, but also to the laws
of other countries that may be involved.“ Once again, however, Article I(2) of the Treaty,
which refers to investments “acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the
country receiving the investment,” makes clear that the relevant law for this issue is the
legislation of Argentina.

2. Claimants’ Alleged Illegalities

Respondent has failed to demonstrate that Claimants, as a factual matter, committed illegalities
in the process of acquiring their investment in the Argentine Airlines. In this respect, the onus is
on Respondent. While Claimants must make a prima facie showing that their investment comes
within the protections of the Treaty,“ Respondent has not, with this objection, raised any issue
of fact to counter Claimants’ showing.*”

As Claimants note, Respondent has not denied that Air Comet prevailed at the SEPI auction and
legally acquired 99.2% shares of Interinvest, and that the SPA is a legal and binding agreement

463 Inceysa v. El Salvador, Award, at § 242 (emphasis added).

464 Td at | 236.

465 Mem. § 340.

466 See, e.g., Salini v. Jordan, Decision on Jurisdiction, {| 151 (“In conformity with [substantial] jurisprudence, the
Tribunal will accordingly seek to determine whether the facts alleged by the Claimant in this case, if established, are
capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.”).

467 4 number of tribunals have held that a respondent bears the burden of proof with respect to the facts alleged in its
jurisdictional objections. See, e.g., Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3), Decision on
Jurisdiction, April 18, 2008, 4] 75, Exhibit C-523. (“It will be seen that the jurisdictional objection entails issues of
fact (whether the investments were and are under Mr. Patriciu’s dominant control; whether the origin of the
investment funds was Romanian), and issues of law (what effect such factual circumstances would have on the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear a complaint by the investor). The issues of fact are ones which the Respondent bears
the burden of proving according to the requisite standard, in order to sustain the claims of law it bases on them. The
Parties are in dispute over both the issues of fact and the issues of law.”); Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic
of Yemen (ICSID Case No. ARBO5/17), Award, February 6, 2008, 105 (LA AR 83) (“the Respondent has not
come close to satisfying the Arbitral Tribunal that the Claimant made an investment which was either inconsistent
with Yemeni laws or regulations or failed to achieve acceptance by the Respondent.”); Hamester v. Ghana, Award
at | 132 (“Having carefully considered all the evidence, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not fully
discharged its burden of proof” with respect to respondent’s allegation of illegality in the inception of the
investment).

  

77

326.

327.

329.

under Spanish law.** Instead, Respondent relies on the argument that account must be taken of
the whole complex transaction leading to the “inception” of the investment—i.e., the SPA and its
“related legal acts, including the breach of or compliance with its terms.“

However, Respondent’s reliance on the whole of the SPA “transaction” is misplaced. The SPA
is a contract between SEPI and Air Comet to effectuate an exchange of benefits, liabilities and
obligations. Some of the commitments made by the parties relate to the transfer of share
ownership in Interinvest.*”” However, the SPA’s other commitments concern not only SEPI’s
assumption of liabilities and other economic commitments of the Argentine Airlines, but also
obligations as diverse as management structures, the size of the Argentine Airlines’ aircraft fleet,
the air routes to be taken by the Argentine Airlines, and employee headcount.‘”! Each of these
commitments, whether they are related to the transfer of shares or not, represents a promise to
perform once the contract has been executed. As such, any question of whether either party has
complied with or breached any of these terms of the SPA is a question of performance. Any
breach that occurs later does not retroactively invalidate, render illegal or otherwise undermine
the integrity or binding nature of the SPA itself; rather, it triggers a party’s legal liability under
the SPA.

As discussed above, the relevant jurisdictional inquiry is whether Claimants acquired or made
their investment in compliance with Argentine law. Here, Claimants made their investment by
entering into the SPA. There is no evidence on the record that Claimants failed to comply with
any Argentine laws or committed any illegalities in entering the SPA. No evidence suggests that
either Claimants or SEPI were not authorized to sign the agreement, that Claimants committed
fraud or made a critical omission in how they represented themselves during the bidding process,
or that Claimants engaged in any corruption or failure to comply with bidding or other
procurement requirements.

Consequently, this Tribunal finds that each of Respondent’s allegations concerns either
Claimants’ performance under the SPA (i.e., Claimants’ subrogation of ARSA’s creditors’
claims) or other events subsequent to the acquisition of their investment. Respondent’s
allegations regarding whether Claimants wrongly approved of ARSA’s 2001 balance sheets,
whether Claimants’ role in ARSA’s reorganization violated Argentine law, and whether the
Marsans Group “deplorably managed” its investments, are all issues arising subsequently to
Claimants’ acquisition of their investment.

3. Claimants’ Alleged Lack of Good Faith

As a final argument, Respondent asserts that Claimants breached good faith principles when Air
Comet subrogated ARSA’s creditors’ claims and when it failed to declare this subrogation to the

468 CM 4313.

332.

responsible tax authorities.” Respondent also generally accuses Grupo Marsans of ignoring
good faith principles “in multiple jurisdictions.”*”*

None of these alleged acts relate to the acquisition of Claimants’ investment, but rather post-date
the making of the investment. Moreover, the cases cited by Respondent held that the relevant
inquiry for whether an investment breaches good faith principles is determined with respect to
the acquisition of their investment. In Inceysa, the case upon which Respondent principally
relies, the tribunal found that the claimant’s numerous fraudulent representations violated the
fundamental rules of the bidding process and constituted a breach of good faith.’ Unlike the
present case, Inceysa concerned the claimant’s acts with respect to the acquisition of its
investment. Likewise, in Phoenix, the tribunal found that the claimants had made no actual
“economic investment” but rather “simply a rearrangement of assets within a family to gain
access to ICSID jurisdiction to which the initial investor was not entitled.”*”* Phoenix is simply
not on point to the circumstances of the present dispute. Therefore, Respondent has failed to
demonstrate that Claimants did not act in good faith in acquiring their investment.

In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s fourth objection.
The Tribunal notes that certain of the allegations raised under this objection may affect the
merits of the claim and that it will be open to the Parties to make further submissions in respect
of these allegations as appropriate during the merits stage of the Arbitration.

Vv. Costs

Both Parties have requested the Tribunal to order costs and fees, plus interest, against the
opposing Party. The Tribunal reserves this question for subsequent adjudication.

SEPARATE OPINION OF DR. KAMAL HOSSAIN
INTRODUCTION

While I agree with the Decision on Jurisdiction (“the Decision’) to the extent that the
Objections to Jurisdiction cannot be accepted at this stage (the jurisdiction stage), I
am of the view that some critical issues involved can be properly determined only
after consideration of evidence, which may be presented at the merits stage. I am,
therefore, setting out below reasons for my Separate Opinion.

I. FACTS RELEVANT TO JURISDICTION
a. Parties

The statement in paragraph 1 of the Decision that Claimants are members of a group
of companies known collectively as the Grupo Marsans does not substantiate or
clarify the averments in paragraph 2 of the Claimants’ Memorial on Merits dated
29.9.2012 (“CMM”) to the effect that the Claimants purchased Argentine Airlines in
2001 and owned and operated them until the Argentine Government nationalized
them in 2008. These averments remain unproven assertions and would have to be
proved by production of evidence. The rejection of Objections to Jurisdiction,
therefore, is subject to the power reserved by the Tribunal to conclusively determine
the objections after consideration of the evidence presented at the merits stage.

b. Dispute
@ Acquisition of the Argentine Airlines

From the evidence thus far produced at the jurisdiction stage it is clear that it was a
Spanish Company, Air Comet, which acquired the shares held by Sociedad Estatal de
Participaciones Industriales (“SEPT”), a Spanish Government entity for one dollar
under the Share Purchase Agreement dated 20 October, 2001 (“SPA”). As noted
above in paragraph 1, the Claimants’ assertion in the CMM that the Claimants
purchased Argentine Airlines in 2001 and owned and operated them until 2008
remains an unproven assertion. Footnote 8 in the Decision starts with the assertion
that Teinver’s initial share purchase (was) in 2006, which is clearly inconsistent with
the statement in paragraph 2 of the Claimants CMM that “Claimants purchased the
Argentine Airlines in 2001”. In that footnote, the ownership structure in place at the
time that Claimants instituted this arbitration on December 11, 2008 is described, and
it concludes with the following statement: “During this time, Air Comet has kept its
shareholdings in Interinvest, which in turn has kept its shareholdings in ARSA and
AUSA.” What is meant by “during this time” in this statement needs to be clarified.

Without these clarifications, and consideration of evidence, the following statements
in paragraph 8 of the Decision raise certain questions:

“TA]cording to Claimants, the dispute centers on two preliminary issues:

(i) a disagreement between the Parties as to the Argentine
regulatory framework—regarding airfare caps in particular—within

IL.

Il.

6.

which the Argentine Airlines were required to operate between 2002
and 2008, and

(ii) disagreement between the Parties as to the remedy due to
Claimants for the expropriation of their shares in those airlines”.

The questions raised are as follows: Who are “the Parties” referred to in sub-
paragraph (i) above, which shares can be described as “their (Claimants’) shares” and
on what basis can the Claimants assert ownership of shares which are described in
sub-paragraph (ii) above as “their shares” in the airlines ?

The answer to these questions will have to be taken into account in order to arrive at
definitive findings at the merits stage on key questions such as Claimants’
investments. The statement in paragraph 2 of the CMM that: “This is a
straightforward case of formal expropriation without compensation by the
Government of Argentina ... the GOA has paid no compensation to the Claimants
for taking of their investments” requires consideration of evidence to determine what
is meant by Claimants’ investments and whether their investments have been the
subject-matter of expropriation.

PROCEDURAL MATTERS
a. Request for Arbitration and its Registration by ICSID

The Separate Opinion relies on the Procedural History set out in Part II of the
Decision.

POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON JURISDICTION
Respondent’ submissions are summarized in paragraph 72 of the Decision as follows:

i. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants failed to meet the

requirements set forth in Article X of the Treaty;

ii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants have no legal
standing to claim for legal rights that belong to another legal person;

iii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate certain of Claimants’
allegations that concern the acts of non-state entities, which cannot be
attributed to Respondent; and

iv. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investment invoked by
Claimants is not an investment protected by the Treaty.

The Claimants’ Submissions on Jurisdiction are summarized in paragraph 73 of the
Decision as follows:

i. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims because
Claimants have satisfied the procedural provisions of the Australia-
Argentina BIT, which they may rely on through the application of the
Treaty’s MEN clause;

IV.

. The Tribunal has jurisdiction, in the alternative, because Claimants
have satisfied and/or are excused for reasons of futility from the
requirements set forth in Article X of the Treaty;

iii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims because

Claimants are legitimate parties to this arbitration;

iv. The Tribunal should defer questions of state attribution for acts of non-
state entities to the merits phase of this arbitration or, in the alternative,
determine that the acts alleged are attributable to Respondent; and

v. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims because

Claimants’ investment was acquired and effected in accordance with

the legislation of Argentina and in good faith.

JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS

a. First Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants’ fulfillment of the procedural
requirements of Article X of the Treaty

According to Respondent, Claimants failed to meet the requirements of Article 10.
Specifically, Respondent alleges that Claimants have not attempted to amicably settle
their dispute in accordance with Article X(1) and (2) of the Treaty and further that
Claimants have not subjected their dispute to the Argentine courts for a period of
eighteen months before seeking this arbitration, in accordance with Article X(3).
(Paragraphs 2 to 25 — Respondent’s Memorial on Objection to Jurisdiction -
“RMOJ”).

The Claimants have made two responses to this objection. First, Claimants assert that
they are entitled to invoke the Treaty’s MFN clause in Article ITV(2) in order to
benefit from the more favorable dispute settlement provisions of other BITs
negotiated by Argentina. Second, Claimants assert that even if the Treaty’s MFN
clause does not permit them to borrow the dispute settlement provisions from other
Argentine BITs, they have satisfied the requirements of Article X of the Treaty, or, in
the alternative, that they should be excused from Article X’s requirements for reasons
of futility. (Paragraphs 7 to 10 — Claimants’ Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction
“(MJ”).

i. Compliance with the requirements of Article X

The Tribunal first addressed the issue of Claimants’ Compliance with the
requirements of Article X of the Treaty. After a careful and exhaustive consideration
of the submissions and the evidence presented and the reasons articulated in
paragraphs 107 to 136 the Tribunal found that the Claimants have satisfied the
requirements of Article X(1-3) of the Treaty (paragraph 116 of the Decision).

In my view, therefore, since the Tribunal has arrived at an agreed finding that the
Claimants have satisfied the procedural requirements of Article X of the BIT, it is not
necessary for the Tribunal to embark upon consideration of the alternative submission
invoking the MEN clause. In my view when an issue can be resolved, as in this case,
by relying on an express provision (Article X) and a clear finding can be, and has
been, arrived at that its requirements have been fulfilled, recourse to the MFN clause

is not justified. That would involve reaching out to other agreements and
consideration of contested issues on which an agreed interpretation would be difficult
and may even prove to be impossible. This is why recourse in these circumstances to
the MFN clause may well be avoided. The more so, since jurisprudence on the issue
of whether an MEN clause can be applied to jurisdictional issues reveals considerable
divergence of juristic views and is the subject of continuing controversy.

The parties had pointed to a significant body of jurisprudence on the issue of whether
MEN clauses can be applied to jurisdictional issues. Both parties had acknowledged
that this body of case law is not consistent, and that there remains a great deal of
controversy on this issue.”'. The divergence of opinions by tribunals on MEN clauses
is not only with regard to the interpretation of ordinary meaning.

Investment arbitration jurisprudence on the ordinary meaning of MEN provisions has
not been entirely consistent, even when the same BIT is concerned. Notably, each of
the cases that has addressed Article IV(2) of the Spain-Argentina BIT has concluded
that the broad language of the MEN clause applies to the Article X dispute resolution
provisions. However, other tribunals have disagreed. The Belgium/Luxembourg-
Soviet Union BIT applied by the tribunal in Berschader contained “all matters”
language similar to that of the Spain-Argentina BIT. Nonetheless, the Berschader
tribunal rejected the claimant’s attempt to use the MFN clause. In contrast with the
tribunals in Maffezini, Gas Natural and the Suez cases, the tribunal in Berschader
noted that “‘all matters covered by the present treaty” cannot be interpreted “literally,”
because the MFN clause is not capable of being applied at all to several of the matters
covered by the BIT.

I would like to express my reservation with regard to the analysis and observations set
out in paragraphs 137 to 186 of the Decision and to express my disagreement with the
conclusion expressed in paragraph 186 which commences with statement that: “the
Tribunal finds that Claimants may equally rely on the Article 1V(2) MFN clause of
the Treaty to make use of the dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 13 of
the Australia-Argentina BIT.”

I find support for my view in recent juristic writing, in which the cases have been
critically analyzed. Newcombe and Paradell? after reviewing the jurisprudence
observe that: “... the overview of the jurisprudence ... highlights (that) tribunals have
adopted conflicting approaches to the application of MEN clauses to investor-state
arbitration provisions” and that “(t)he use of MFN treatment to obtain the more
favourable procedural treatment in other investor-state arbitration provisions has been
criticized on the basis that it amounts to cherry picking”, and conclude that: “At
present, the more persuasive view is that MFN treatment obligations with respect to
foreign investment and investors arise only on the basis of an express treaty
obligation.”

Campbell McLachlan QC et al. have expressed their views in the following terms:?
“This analysis led the Tribunal to substitute instead a simple rule of construction to
the effect that an MEN provision would not apply to dispute settlement provisions
unless the parties expressly provided that it did. It is submitted that the reasoning of
the Tribunal in Plama is to be strongly preferred over that in Maffezini .... The result,
if , as is suggested, the approach in Plama is preferred, will be that the MFN clause
will not apply to investment treaties’ dispute settlement provisions, save where the
States expressly so provide.”

A critical review which covers some of the most recent cases by Paparinskis
concludes that: *

“The cases after 2007 are less easily read as reflecting an even implicit
consensus. Some recent decisions follow the earlier approaches. The 2009
decision in Tza Yap Shum and the majority decision in Austrian Airlines
rejected the investors’ argument for the extension of its jurisdiction. The
former tribunal explained itself as following both Plama and Maffezini and the
majority of the latter tribunal also relied on the distinction between substantive
and procedural rules attracted by the MFN clause. In 2011, a majority of the
Impregilo tribunal explicitly situated itself within the Maffezini line of
decisions. However, the recent general trend rejects earlier practices and
explanations.”

I find the analysis in the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Professor Brigitte
Stern in the Jmpregilo case persuasive. The following extracts from that Opinion are
set out below:*

Professor Brigitte Stern.

“78. Just as an MEN clause cannot change the conditions ratione personae,
ratione materiae, and ratione temporis, as has just been demonstrated, it must
be equally true that an MFN clause cannot change the condition ratione
voluntatis, which is a qualifying condition for the enjoyment of the
jurisdictional rights open for the protection of substantial rights.

79. In other words, before a provision relating to the dispute settlement
mechanism can be imported into the basic treaty, the right to international
arbitration — here ICSID arbitration — has to be capable of coming into
existence for the foreign investor under the basic treaty, in other words the
existence of this right is conditioned on the fulfillment of all the necessary
conditions for such jurisdiction, the conditions ratione personae, ratione
materiae, and ratione temporis as well as a supplementary condition relating
to the scope of the State’s consent to such jurisdiction, the condition ratione
voluntatis.

80. As long as the qualifying conditions expressed by the State in order to give
its consent are not fulfilled, there is no consent, in other words no access of the
foreign investor to the jurisdictional treatment granted by ICSID arbitration.
An MEN clause cannot enlarge the scope of the basic treaty’s right to
international arbitration, it cannot be used to grant access to international
arbitration when this is not possible under the conditions provided for in the
basic treaty.

83. There appears to be no legal reason to treat differently these two types of
requirements that condition the State’s consent. On this issue, I am in
agreement with my co-arbitrator Charles Brower, who explained in his
Separate opinion in Renta 4, that “ ... there is no reason to differentiate
between admissibility-related aspects of accessing investor-State arbitration
and matters of jurisdiction ...”

93. The importance of consent has always been stressed in international
arbitration cases and especially in ICSID cases. Plama, of course, has laid a
great emphasis on the necessity of a clear an unambiguous consent:

In the view of the Tribunal, the following consideration is equally, if
not more, important. ... Nowadays, arbitration is the generally accepted
avenue for resolving disputes between investors and states. Yet, that
phenomenon does not take away the basic prerequisite for arbitration:
an agreement of the parties to arbitrate. It is a well-established
principle, both in domestic and international law, that such an
agreement should be clear and unambiguous. In the framework of a
BIT, the agreement to arbitrate is arrived at by the consent to
arbitration that a state gives in advance in respect of investment
disputes falling under the BIT, and the acceptance thereof by an
investor if the latter so desires.

18.

Doubts as to the parties’ clear and unambiguous intention can arise if
the agreement to arbitrate is to be reached by incorporation by
reference”.

96. The decision in Wintershall has insisted again on the idea that
the State must have given its consent and that this consent is a
condition for the access to international arbitration:

In the present case, therefore the BIT between Argentina/and Germany
is a treaty undoubtedly providing for a right of access to international
arbitration (ICSID) for foreign investors, who are German nationals —
but this right of access to ICSID arbitration is not provided for
unreservedly, but upon condition of first approaching competent
Courts in Argentina ... a local-remedies rule may be lawfully provided
for in the BIT — under the first part of Article 26; once so provided, as
in Article 10(2), it becomes a condition of Argentina’s “consent” —
which is, in effect, Argentina’s “offer” to arbitrate disputes under the
BIT, but only upon acceptance and compliance by an investor of the
provisions inter alia of Article 10(2); an investor (like the Claimant)
can accept the “offer” only as so conditioned.”

I am, therefore, of the view that recourse to the MFN clause in the present case is
neither necessary nor justified.

b. Second Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants’ Standing

. Claimants’ Investment in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines

The Respondent’s position as elaborated in paragraphs 85 to 215 of the Memorial on
Objections to the Jurisdiction dated 6 December, 2010 (“MOJ”), at pages 41 to 79
may be summarized as follows:

(a)
(b)
(c)

Argentina-Spain BIT does not afford any protection to “indirect shareholders”
No “investment” recognized by Argentine law was expropriated.
The definition of “investment” under the Argentine-Spain BIT is clearly

narrower than that under the US-Argentina BIT. The following submission is
made in paragraph 164 of the MOJ, page 64:

“164. The concept of investment under the US-Argentina BIT is
clearly broader than that of the Argentina-Spain BIT. For these
reasons, the material scope of the Argentina-Spain BIT should not be
extended, as Claimants wrongly expect, to include their mere interests
in the indirect shareholdings they currently have (in the case of Teinver
S.A.) or previously had (in the case of Transportes de Cercanias S.A.
and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.) in Interinvest S.A., Aerolineas
Argentinas S.A. and Austral-Cielos del Sur. Claimants cannot interpret

20.

21.

22.

the applicable BIT in an extensive manner, distorting its content and
invoking a scope of protection that simply does not exist.”

I find that the Decision has not addressed the reasoning underlying the above
arguments but tends to follow, what in my view, are questionable assertions in some
earlier ICSID cases. The facts of this case do not justify simply adopting the
interpretations which found favour in earlier cases, in particular in cases such as
Siemens v. Argentine Republic or Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela.

I find it difficult to accept the reasoning in the Siemens case which is set out in the
following terms (emphasis added):

“The Tribunal has conducted a detailed analysis of the reference in the Treaty
to “investment” and “investor”. The Tribunal observes that there is no
explicit reference to direct or indirect investment as such in the Treaty.”

“The Treaty does not require that there be no interposed companies
between the investment and the ultimate owner of the company.
Therefore, a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation that
the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.” (paragraph No.
137 of the Decision on Jurisdiction dated 03.08.2004 in Siemens Ag v.
Argentine Republic.)

“The tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect
investments in the BIT. The definition of investment given in Article 1 is
very broad. It includes “every kind of assets” and enumerates specific
categories of investments as examples. One of those categories consists of
“shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and joint
ventures”.

“The BIT does not require that there be no interposed companies between
the ultimate owner of the company or of the joint venture and the
investment. Therefore, a literal reading of the BIT does not support the
allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.”

I find equally unacceptable the reasoning in the Mobil case referred to which is stated
in the following terms: “Investment as defined in Article 1 could be direct or indirect
as recognized in similar cases”. (Paragraph No. 165 of the Decision on Jurisdiction
dated 10.06.2010 in Mobil Corporation, Venezuela and others vs. Venezuela.)

In Article I(2) of the BIT: (emphasis added in dark bold letters):
“The term “investments” shall mean any kind of assets, such as property
and rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the
legislation of the country receiving the investment and in particular, but not

exclusively, the following:

- Shares and other terms of participation in companies;

23.

24.

25.

The content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories
of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party in
whose territory the investment is situated.”

The words “in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving
investments” in Article I(2) must be given due weight.

In my view on a plain reading of the words in Article I(2) of the BIT shares held in a
company means shares directly held, unless indirectly held shares are expressly
included. An interpretation, which would expand the meaning to include shares
“indirectly held” cannot be understood to be the plain meaning of the word “held”
since “indirectly held” widens the scope without limit, and enlarges the obligation
imposed (also without limit). It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that to include
“shares indirectly held” this must be done expressly as in the US BITs.

I think we need to heed the caution counseled by Campbell McLachlan and his co-
authors in the following terms:

“Those involved in investment treaty arbitrations should take care not to allow
the use of other awards to transgress the appropriate boundaries. Their citation
should not overwhelm a tribunal’s consideration of the case before it.””

In my view the following submissions merit serious consideration:

(a) The interpretative principle of in dubio mitius, requires that in interpreting
treaties, if the meaning of a term is ambiguous, that meaning is to be preferred which
is less onerous to the party assuming an obligation, or which interferes less with the
territorial and personal supremacy of a party, or involves less general restrictions
upon the parties.”

(b) The Respondent in its Memorial on Objections to the Jurisdiction dated 6
December 2010 submits that: “Under international law, indirect or derivative claims
cannot be filed. Nonetheless, some treaties have expressly provided for indirect or
derivative actions under extraordinary circumstances. This constitutes an exception to
the general principle that no person may bring a claim on behalf of another” (p. 56,
para 141). In support of its argument the Respondent cites the Case Concerning
Ahmadou Sadio Diallo® and International Thunderbird Gaming Corp and the United
Mexican States, UNCITRAL case under the NAFTA rules (Submission of the United
States of America, paras 4-9.)

26. In a recent survey of awards by M. Valasek and P. Dumberry, the following views are
expressed?

“\.. arbitral tribunals have also recognized the right of intermediate (‘shell’)
corporations to submit their own claims to arbitration. These developments
have even led some authors to suggest the existence of a new “rule” of
customary international law providing shareholders with a procedural “right”
to bring arbitration claims against the State where they make the investment.
These are undoubtedly overall positive developments for the protection of
foreign investors. This evolution nevertheless gives rise to several legitimate
concerns from the perspective of capital-importing States that have entered
into numerous BITs.

The first area of concern relates to the fact that BITs typically do not
distinguish between minority and majority shareholders which can submit
separate claims from that of the corporation. As a matter of principle, all
shareholders big and small, should receive legal protection under a BIT that
does not expressly distinguish between them. This situation nevertheless raises
some concerns where a corporation’s share capital is divided between
numerous shareholders each holding a very small percentage of the total
number of shares (imagine, for instance, 100 different shareholders each
owning a mere 1% of the corporation’s share). Nothing (apart, of course, from
the high costs of pursuing international arbitration) would prevent all these
different shareholders from filing their own separate claims against the host
State for the same treaty breach. Another area of concern is related to the
protection offered to indirect investments made through multiple layers of
intermediate corporations. Again, under a typical BIT, each holding company
in a long chain of ownership could file its own separate claim against the host
State for the same treaty breach.

As a result, capital-importing countries having entered into a significant
number of BIT’s will increasingly run the risk of being respondents in
multiple (and often simultaneous) arbitration claims filed by different entities
included in the increasingly sophisticated and complex corporate structure of
foreign investors. Such multiple claims will clearly result in very high legal
costs for respondent States. They will also increase the likelihood of
inconsistent arbitral decisions.

This possibility is not merely theoretical, as shown by the Lauder saga. Mr.
Lauder, a U.S. national, was the ultimate beneficiary of an investment he made
in the Czech Republic through an intermediate corporation (CME, a Dutch
corporation). Mr. Lauder commenced an arbitration claim under the U.S. —
Czech Republic BIT, while CME, 6 months later, started its own proceeding
before a different arbitral tribunal under the Netherlands —Czech Republic
BIT. Both claims arose from the same facts. It should be noted that the Czech
Republic refused to consolidate the proceedings as requested by the

“Developments in the Legal Standing of Shareholders and Holding Corporations in Investor-State
Dispute”, ICSID Review, Spring 2011, p. 73 et seq.

27.

28.

29.

11

Claimants. The disturbing aspect of these two parallel arbitration cases is that
one Tribunal concluded that the Czech Republic had expropriated the
investment and awarded $360 million in damages to the Claimant, while the
other Tribunal rejected the claim.

The scenarios envisaged above also raise the issue of remoteness between a
shareholder and the actual investment ... This issue was addressed by the
Enron Tribunal, which summarized a concern raised by Argentina as follows:

The Enron Tribunal concluded that such concern raises the “need to establish
a cut-off point beyond which claims would not be permissible as they would
have only a remote connection to the affected company. For the Enron
Tribunal, the establishment of a “cut-off point” beyond which claims by
indirect shareholders would not be allowed should be based on “the extent of
the consent to arbitration of the host State:”

Tf consent has been given in respect of an investor and an investment, it can be
reasonably concluded that the claims brought by such investor are admissible
under the treaty. If the consent cannot be considered as extending to another
investor or investment, these other claims should then be considered
inadmissible as being only remotely connected with the affected company and
the scope of the legal system protecting that investment.

The issue of remoteness of claims is likely to be one of the most contentious in
the future. While some authors have criticized the Enron Tribunal’s reasoning
on the “cut-off point” as lacking any “legal foundation”, recent awards have
acknowledged the seriousness of the issue. As explained by the Phoenix
Tribunal, some concern has indeed been voiced by international tribunals, and
is shared by this Tribunal, that not any minor portion of indirectly owned
shares should necessarily be considered as an investment. For good reasons,
tribunals will, however, be reluctant to establish in each case where exactly
should be the cut-off point. Indeed, no consensus exists on what “too remote”
really means in practical terms.”

The Argentine Republic has rightly raised a concern about the fact that if minority
shareholders can claim independently from the affected corporation, this could trigger
an endless chain of claims, as any shareholder making an investment in a company
that makes an investment in another company, and so on, could invoke a direct right
of action for measures affecting a corporation at the end of the chain.

In the instant case, there is no evidence at this stage that participation of the
Claimants’ investments was specifically sought by the host state so that they may be
treated as included within the consent to arbitration given by the Argentine Republic.

On the basis of the evidence thus far presented it is not possible to arrive at a finding
that the Claimants have established that they have “indirect investment” through
multiple-layers of corporate entities which can qualify as “protected investment”
under Article I(2) of the BIT. In the article cited above, in paragraph 26, it is stated
that some authors suggest the existence of a new rule of customary international law
providing shareholders with a procedural right to bring arbitration claims against the

30.

31.

32.

33.

12

state where they make the investment. It is noteworthy that both the words “rule” and
the word “right” in the passage quoted are advisedly placed within inverted commas
indicating that the new rule has yet to be recognized as an established rule on which
there is general consensus. Indeed the circumstances in which shareholders may
exercise a “right” against the host state of a company located within the state would
depend upon the specific facts and circumstances and the terms of the relevant treaty
and contractual arrangements.

When a Treaty provision, Article I(2), defines terms which necessarily require
consideration of Argentine law, such as whether an investment has been made in
accordance with Argentina law, and where it expressly provides that the scope and
content of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be
determined by Argentine law, it is necessary to consider whether the “rights” or
“assets” are recognized as such by Argentine law.

In paragraph 233 of the Decision Respondent’s policy arguments against the
Claimants asserting claims on the basis of indirect shareholding are noted. I agree
with the observation in paragraphs 234 of the Decision that Respondent’s assertion
could have relevance in the merits stage proceeding of this case, but are not relevant
at the jurisdictional stage. I, however, disagree with the views expressed in paragraph
235, in particular, with the concluding sentence to the effect that the Claimants have
standing to recover for damages that were inflicted upon the companies and that
ordinary language of Article 1(2) is designed to protect “all assets” including
indirect shareholdings and the finding “the Tribunal also finds that Claimants are not
deprived of standing by the fact that their investments were made through their
subsidiary, Air Comet.” This should not preclude consideration by the Tribunal at the
merits stage of the issue whether reliefs sought on the basis of “rights” asserted in
respect of “investments” made through Air Comet can be granted. These “findings”
while they may be seen as rejecting the jurisdictional objection to standing cannot
definitively determine the question without consideration of the evidence to be
presented at the merits stage together with provisions of Argentine law which are
relevant to determine whether the Claimants’ rights may be enforced and the reliefs
claimed may be granted.

The relevant provisions of Argentine corporate law would need to be considered and
interpreted before such findings can be arrived at.

ii. Claimants’ other investments

I agree with the first sentence of paragraph 238 that the Decision to the effect that the
Tribunal will not address Claimants’ other alleged investments at this time, but cannot
agree with the definitive finding expressed in the second sentence that the Tribunal
find that Claimants’ indirect shareholdings constitute an “investment” under the
Treaty. While for the purpose of determining standing such evidence as has been
placed at the jurisdiction stage may be sufficient to justify that finding, this cannot be
definitive when other issues are concerned, such as the effect of illegality or fraud
committed in the course of performance as well as the effect of an assignment
agreement and a funding agreement entered into after the initiation of the arbitration
which could materially affect rights relating to that investment and their enforceability
in the sense of grant of reliefs claimed in respect of those rights.

37.

38.

iii. Claimants’ third-party funding agreement and assignment of
award proceeds

During the hearing on jurisdiction, Respondent raised its concern that Claimants’ and
Air Comet’s recent reorganization proceedings in Spain could affect Claimants’
authorization to bring this case. In its post-hearing submissions, Respondent has also
questioned two agreements entered into by Claimants subsequent to commencing this
arbitration. One of these, a Credit Assignment Agreement among Teinver,
Transportes Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the
assignee (the “Assignment Agreement”), dated January 18, 2010, concerned the
assignment to Air Comet of the proceeds of a potential award in this arbitration. The
other, a Funding Agreement made between Claimants and Burford Capital Limited,
an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, and effective as of April 14, 2010
(the “Funding Agreement”), concerned the financing of Claimants’ litigation expenses
in this arbitration.

The Parties do not dispute that Air Comet commenced voluntary reorganization
proceedings on April 20, 2010. Nor do they dispute that the Claimants each
commenced voluntary reorganization roughly a year later, with Teinver on December
23, 2010, Autobuses Urbanos on January 28, 2011, and Transportes de Cercanias on
February 16, 2011.

The Parties also acknowledge that Claimants concluded the Assignment Agreement,
by which Claimants agreed to assign to Air Comet proceeds of an eventual award in
this case. In addition, the Parties acknowledge that Claimants executed the Funding
Agreement with Burford. However, the Parties disagree as to the effects of these
agreements on Claimants’ standing in this case.

T agree with the statement in paragraph 255 of the Decision that international case law
has consistently determined that jurisdiction is generally to be assessed as of the date
the case is filed. I, therefore, agree with the conclusion of the Tribunal that
Respondent’s jurisdictional objection may be rejected to the extent that the allegations
concern events that post-date the filing of the arbitration. I also agree with the view of
the Tribunal expressed in paragraph 259 that it will not address Respondent’s
allegations regarding Claimants’ reorganization, assignment agreement and the
funding agreement which post-date the filing of the arbitration, but that these will
receive due consideration at the merits stage.

c Third Jurisdictional Objection: Issues of State Attribution
I agree with the view of the Tribunal 274 of the Decision that: “... Given the fact-

intensive nature of Claimants’ allegations, the Tribunal must postpone adjudication of
this issue until the merits phase.”

d. Fourth Jurisdictional Objection: The Legality of Claimants’ Investment
i. Position of Respondent

The Respondent asserted that the Claimants have violated Spanish and Argentine law,
and committed other misdeeds and, therefore, they cannot assert any rights claimed
under the Claimants’ alleged investments or seek to enforce them or obtain any relief
with respect to those “rights”. The violations of Spanish law are summarized in
paragraph 278 to 289 and the violations of Argentine law are summarized in
paragraphs 290 to 292. Other misdeeds are referred to in paragraphs 293.

The Respondent by is letter dated 24 May, 2012 notified the Tribunal as follows:

“... the Commercial matter No. 9 of Madrid found Gerardo Diaz Ferran and
Gonzalo Pascual Arias — holders of a controlling interest in Claimants and
witnesses in this arbitration — guilty of the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio,
S.A. Furthermore, the court found Teinver S.L., one of the Claimants in this
arbitration proceeding, and other companies of the Marsans Group, such as
Viajes Marsans S.A. and Hotetur Club S.L, liable as accomplices to the
bankruptcy” and than “... fraudulent acts were carried out by means of
complex legal and accounting operations. In the opinion of the court, “all of
them are part of a coordinated action aimed at removing the assets of the
reorganized company in favour of other companies of the group.

In this sense, for instance, the court established that “by virtue of a private
agreement entered into with a company in which Teinver has a 100% interest,
related to Seguros Mercurio and also owned by Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias
through other companies, Seguros Mercurio proceeded to make payments in
the amount of 5,847,039.84 euro in favour of other companies of the group
other than the purchaser company.” In light of the explanations afforded by
the accused parties with respect to the terms of such operation, the court
concluded that “the explanations provided by Mr. Diaz Ferran at the hearing
were devoid of any logic.

Another questionable operation took place on October 30, 2009 and involves
the sale of real property by Teinver to Seguros Mercurio. Oddly enough, it
was found that at the time of the sale the property was about to be foreclosed
at the request of the mortgagee. In this respect, the court held that “the
operation is censurable from the legal point of view since it can be affirmed
that, through it, a sham has been attempted in order to convey a property
image different from the actual one.

Specially in relation to Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, the judge concluded
that they should be reached by the declaration of guilt as “as they
acknowledged in the act of the trial, they designed the operations described,
controlling and deciding on the management not only of Seguros Mercurio,
but of the entire Group, of which they were practically the sole shareholders.”

The Respondent submits that the above facts provide a ground to the Tribunal for
rejection on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.

I agree with the general observation in the Decision that for the purpose of jurisdiction
timing is relevant, and that the Tribunal should focus on illegality at the initiation of
the investment. Matters which arise during performance of the investment or which
are subsequently found to have occurred would not sustain a jurisdictional objection.
I, however, agree with the view elaborated in the Hamester case cited in paragraph
320 of the Decision, as follows:

“... Legality in the subsequent life or performance of the investment is not
addressed in Article 10. It follows that this does not bear upon the scope of
application of the BIT (and hence this Tribunal’s jurisdiction) — albeit that it
may well be relevant in the context of the substantive merits of a claim
brought under the BIT. Thus, on the wording of this BIT, the legality of the
creation of the investment is a jurisdictional issue; the legality of the investor’s
conduct during the life of the investment is a merits issue.”

Iam, therefore, of the view that observation in the Decision on issues which are post-
commencement would not prejudice the Tribunal’s consideration of those matters in
the light of evidence and submissions presented at the merits stage.

I, therefore, agree with the conclusions in paragraph 331 of the Decision that “The
Tribunal notes that certain of the allegations raised may affect the merits of the claim
and that it will be open to the parties to make further submissions in respect of these
allegations as appropriate during the merits stage of the arbitration.”

I agree with the Tribunal’s view in paragraph 332 reserving this question for
subsequent adjudication.

VI. DECISION ON JURISDICTION

45. I agree (subject to the observations and reservations set out above in my Separate
Opinion) with the Decision of the Tribunal set out in paragraph 333 as follows:

qd) The Objections to Jurisdiction are rejected;

(2) It joins to the merits the determination of Respondent’s responsibility for the
acts of non-state entities.
