SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Claimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The

Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page 2.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 26 August 2016, Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration (“RfA”) with the Arbitration
Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, (“SCC”) pursuant to Article 26(4)(c) of
the ECT and Article 2 of the Arbitration Rules of the SCC 2010 (“SCC Rules”). The SCC

confirmed receipt of the RfA by correspondence of the same date.

In its RfA, Claimants proposed that the Tribunal should consist of three arbitrators.
Claimants appointed Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs as their party-appointed arbitrator pursuant to
Article 13 SCC Rules. Further, Claimants proposed that the Chairperson of the Tribunal be
selected by the two party-appointed arbitrators, with agreement of the parties. In addition,
Claimants proposed Geneva, Switzerland as the seat of arbitration, and English as the

procedural language for the arbitration.*

By correspondence dated 29 August 2016, the SCC sent a copy of the RfA to Respondent,

inviting it to submit its Answer by 29 September 2016.

By correspondence dated 8 September 2016, Respondent acknowledged receipt of the RfA
and requested the SCC to extend the deadline for submission of its Answer to 30

November 2016.

Upon being invited by the SCC to comment on Respondent’s request for extension, on 15
September 2016, Claimants informed the SCC that they considered Respondent’s request
for a two-month extension to be unreasonable, and were instead prepared to agree to an

extension until 31 October 2016.

On 16 September 2016, the SCC granted Respondent an extension of time until 31 October

2016 to submit its Answer, stating that the Answer may be brief.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

On 31 October 2016, Respondent submitted its Answer to Claimants’ RfA, together with a
Request for Dismissal under Article 10 SCC Rules, on the ground that the SCC manifestly

lacked jurisdiction over the dispute (“Answer and Request for Dismissal”).°

In its Answer and Request for Dismissal, Respondent stated that in the event the case was
not dismissed under Article 10 SCC Rules, it would agree with Claimants’ proposals that
the Tribunal be composed to three arbitrators, and that the Chairperson of the Tribunal be
selected by the two party-appointed arbitrators with agreement of the parties (see J 8
above). Respondent requested until 7 November 2016 to indicate its party-appointed
arbitrator. In addition, Respondent proposed Rome, Italy as the seat of arbitration, and

Italian as the procedural language.°

On 7 November 2016, Respondent appointed Prof. Andrea Giardina as its party-appointed

arbitrator pursuant to Article 13 SCC Rules.

On 9 November 2016, Claimants provided their comments to Respondent’s Answer and
Request for Dismissal, requesting that the SCC Board of Directors (“SCC Board”) dismiss
Respondent’s Request for Dismissal under Article 10 SCC Rules. Further, Claimants
rejected Respondent’s proposal of Rome, Italy as the seat of arbitration and Italian as the

procedural language.

By correspondence dated 17 November 2016, the SCC informed the Parties that the SCC
Board had decided that (i) the SCC did not manifestly lack jurisdiction under Article 10
SCC Rules; and (ii) the seat of arbitration shall be Stockholm, Sweden. In the same
correspondence, the SCC stated that it shall proceed to give the two party-appointed
arbitrators the opportunity to appoint the Chairperson of the Tribunal. The SCC wrote to
the party-appointed, in this regard, on 17 November 2016, requesting them to provide the

SCC with the selected Chairperson’s name by 2 December 2016.

On 13 January 2017, the SCC informed the Parties that the party-appointed arbitrators had
jointly appointed Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg as the Chairperson of the Tribunal, and that

the SCC shall refer the case to the Tribunal shortly.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Pursuant to Article 18 SCC Rules, the SCC referred the case to the Tribunal on 16 January
2017.

By correspondence dated 27 January 2017 to the Tribunal, the European Commission
(“EC”) filed an Application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in this
arbitration (“EC Intervention Application”). In the EC Intervention Application, it
questioned the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to arbitrate the present case, inter alia, on the ground
that the case pertains to obligations of European Union (“EU”) Member States inter se,
which cannot be resolved by way of investor-State dispute settlement under the ECT.’ The
EC invoked the Tribunal’s “case-management powers” under Article 19 SCC Rules to
grant its request for intervention as a non-disputing party.* On this basis, it requested the
Tribunal to (i) set a deadline for the EC to file a written submission; (iii) allow the EC
access to the documents filed in the case, to the extent necessary for its intervention; and

(iv) grant the EC leave to present its views at an oral hearing, if any takes place.”

By correspondence dated 31 January 2017, the Tribunal wrote the Parties (i) proposing to

and to what extent the EC shall be given access to the documents filed in these
proceedings.'? The Tribunal informed the EC of its decision to partially grant the EC

Intervention Application by correspondence dated 17 March 2017.

Thereafter, by correspondence dated 21 March 2017, the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 37
SCC Rules, requested the SCC Board to extend the time limit for rendering the Final
Award, in light of the fact that the Timetable for these proceedings, established with the

Parties’ consent, extended at least until mid-2019.

submit any comments on the Tribunal’s request for extension of the time limit for

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

EVOLUTION OF ITALY’S GENERAL POLICIES ON RENEWABLE ENERGY

 

Italy started taking steps towards promoting energy consumption through non-fuel energy
sources in the 1980s and 1990s. This was motivated, at least in part, by the EU’s objective
to move towards harmonizing the energy market of its Member States, while
simultaneously endorsing production of electricity through renewable energy. This
evolution of Italy’s and the EU’s initial polices relating to renewable energy shall be

discussed in Sections (1) and (2) below, respectively.

(1) | Italy’s Policies through 1980s and Early 1990s

In 1982, Italy enacted the Law No. 308/1982, which aimed to promote, “consistently with
the European Community energy policy, the limitation of energy consumptions and the use
of renewable energy sources”.!° To this end, Italy committed to provide certain capital
contributions and other financial incentives to promote renewable energy.'® In this
connection, Law No. 308/1982 also envisaged the sale, trade and dispatch of the electricity
generated by renewable energy plants under the capacity of 3000 kW shall be “regulated
by ad hoc agreements” with the National Entity for Electricity, which was a state-owned
company then. The sale price of electricity was to be established by an Inter-Ministerial

Committee of Prices.!”

The general framework contained in Law No. 308/1982 was followed by the National
Energy Plan of 1988 in Italy (“1988 Energy Plan”). The 1988 Energy Plan laid out
specific aims and strategies concerning Italy’s energy plan until the year 2000.'* In
particular, the 1988 Energy Plan laid out five primary objectives for Italy’s energy policy.
These were (i) energy savings; (ii) environmental protection; (iii) development of natural
resources; (iv) diversification in the use of the various import sources and the geographic
and political diversification of procurement areas; and (v) the competitiveness of the

production system.!?

Thereafter, Italy introduced the first specific incentive regime in support of renewable
energy facilities by way of Law No. 9/1991.7° Law No. 9/1991 crucially removed the
capacity limit of the Law No. 308/1982 of 3000 kW (see { 93 above), so that the
competitive pricing of electricity established by the Inter-Ministerial Committee of Prices

could benefit all renewable energy facilities in the country.?!

Further to this, the Inter-Ministerial Committee of Prices established a new price regime on
29 April 1992.” This price regime of 1992 specifically provided for a three-fold incentive
scheme for renewable energy facilities as well as for the “assimilated” sources including
thermal and gas facilities. First, these facilities were entitled to the so-called “avoided
costs” for a period of 15 years since the entry into operation.” Second, they were entitled

to an incentivizing component for a period of eight years differentiated based on the source

(2) EC’s Directives and Italy’s Policies through 1990s and Early 2000s

Italy’s early steps towards safer and environmentally friendly energy sources in the 1980s
and early 1990s was followed by the EU taking steps towards the harmonization and

liberalisation of the electricity market of EU Member States.

In 1996, the EC issued the EC Directive 96/92/EC, which entered into force in February
1997.6 The EC Directive 96/92/EC primarily aimed at liberalising the common electricity
market of the EU, but it also mentioned that “priority may be given to the production of
electricity from renewable sources” by EU Member States for reasons of environmental

protection.?’

In February 1998, the EC prepared a report in relation to this EC Directive 96/92/EC,
specifically concerning renewable energy and the EU’s targets under the Kyoto Protocol,
which had been adopted in December 1997.78 In this connection, the EC’s report, inter
alia, stated that pursuant to “[t]he ‘Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations
framework on Climate Change’ . . . held in Kyoto in December 1997 . . . the [EC] agreed
to a commitment of an 8% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008 to
2012 compared to 1990.” This would require “[m]ajor energy policy decisions, focusing on
reducing energy and carbon intensity”, and “[a]ccelerating the penetration of renewable

energy sources in the production of electricity”.””

100. Italy signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998.%° Shortly thereafter, in April 1999, Italy’s

101.

National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development
issued a White Paper for the development of renewable energy sources.*! The White Paper
considered numerous principle and strategy matters relating to the growth of renewable

energy in Italy, while recognizing the EU’s targets as well.

Pertinently, the White Paper laid out a target of “additional contribution of renewables of
approximately 8.6 Mtoe running from 11.7 Mtoe to 20.3 Mtoe for 2008-2012 in terms of
substituted conventional fuel”.*? Further, in respect of photovoltaic solar energy, while
recognizing that significant research is required in this field, which was still in its “young”

stage, the White Paper, inter alia, stated the following:

At this time in fact, the cost of electric energy from photovoltaic plants
connected to the network is comprised between 500 and 1000 L/kWh, and the
margins for further reductions seem limited if we take into account only scale
economies. Therefore, for the time being, it is not appropriate to build other

large plants with public intervention.**

Photovoltaic is, in principle, the most attractive renewable energy.

Considering its own characteristics and the great potential, even in the absence
of sure prospects on cost reduction, we believe that photovoltaic must be
developed to the highest levels possible, if anything so as to pre-establish a
“reserve” option, in order to face undesirable environmental and energetic
emergencies, always possible for the decades to come.**

102. Thus, during this time, Italy was moving towards the objectives of enhancing energy

security through independence and liberalization of the market, while simultaneously

achieving environmental targets.*> In this connection, Italy also implemented the EC

Directive 96/92/EC in March 1999, by way of the Legislative Decree No. 79/1999.*° This
was motivated towards the above-mentioned two objectives. First, the Legislative Decree
No. 79/1999 liberalized the electricity market by implementing anti-monopoly rules and
requiring the National Entity for Electricity, the state-owned electricity company in Italy
monopolizing electricity generation until then, to sell off 15,000 MW of its capacity in the
year 2000.*” On a related note, the Decree established a state-owned company, i.e., Gestore
della rete di transmission nazionale Spa (“GRTN”), for dealings with renewable energy

producers.**

The second important step taken under this Legislative Decree No. 79/1999 was to give
renewable energy facilities priority access to the grid.*? Further, to support renewable
energy, the Legislative Decree No. 79/1999 also provided for what was called a green
certificate incentive program. This program, inter alia, required the importers and
producers of energy in Italy, who produce more than 100 GWh per year from non-
renewable sources of energy, to introduce into the national electric grid a certain

percentage of electricity produced by renewable sources.“°

With the advent of the new millennium, on 27 September 2001, the European Parliament
and Council issued EC Directive 2001/77/EC. This EC Directive, for the first time, dealt

specifically and in detail with production of electricity through renewable energy sources

14!

in order to meet the international targets set by the Kyoto Protocol.*’ Thus, it formed a

significant component of the EU’s overall attitude towards renewable energy. Some of the
principal objectives pursued by this EC Directive 2001/77/EC were laid down in the

preamble, inter alia, in the following terms:

The Community recognises the need to promote renewable energy sources as a
priority measure given that their exploitation contributes to environmental
protection and sustainable development.

Member States operate different mechanisms of support for renewable energy
sources at the national level, including green certificates, investment aid, tax
exemptions or reductions, tax refunds and direct price support schemes. One
important means to achieve the aim of this Directive is to guarantee the proper
functioning of these mechanisms, until a Community framework is put into
operation, in order to maintain investor confidence.

It is too early to decide on a Community-wide framework regarding support
schemes, in view of the limited experience with national schemes and the
current relatively low share of price supported electricity produced from
renewable energy sources in the Community all Member States should be
required to set national indicative targets for the consumption of electricity
produced from renewable sources.*”
The EC Directive 2001/77/EC also spoke about setting “national indicative targets” for
each of the Member States for consumption of energy through renewable sources, keeping
in mind the global target of 12% of consumption through renewable sources by 2010, with
which the EU’s target aligned. The EC envisaged the possibility of setting mandatory
targets in future based on the extent of progress made by Member States.*? In this
connection, the Member States were required to set national indicative targets by 27
October 2002 (and then every five years) for future consumption of energy produced from
renewable sources in terms of a percentage, by taking into account, inter alia, reference
values set in the Annex to the EC Directive 2001/77/EC. Italy was ascribed the reference
value for a national indicative target of 25% of the total energy consumption from

renewable sources."

Thereafter, the EC was to assess by 2004-2005, inter alia, (i) the progress made by the
Member States in achieving their national indicative targets; (ii) whether the national

indicative targets were still consistent with the global indicative target of 12% of

consumption through renewable sources of energy;*° and (iii) the overall experience gained
with the application and coexistence of the different support schemes for renewable

energy, “including cost-effectiveness, of the support systems . . . in promoting the
consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources”.*°

On 1 March 2002, Italy enacted Law No. 39/2002, wherein it took steps towards
implementing EC Directive 2001/77/EC. In Law No. 39/2002, it was, inter alia, envisaged
that within the following 18 months, the government will issue one or more legislative
decrees that would provide incentive policies for renewable energy. In this regard, Law
No. 39/2002 specifically provided that these incentives should (i) be based on mechanisms

that promoted both competitiveness and cost reduction; and (ii) not create greater or new
burdens on the State budget.*”

Also in 2002, Italy enacted Law No. 120/2002 for the ratification and implementation of
the Kyoto Protocol in Italy, which it had signed in 1998 (see {| 100 above).

On 26 June 2003, the EC replaced its earlier EC Directive 96/92/EC (see {| 98-99 above)
with EC Directive 2003/54/EC containing new rules on the internal electricity market of

the EU.”? In this connection, the EC Directive 2003/54/EC mentioned that:

Experience in implementing [EC Directive 96/92/EC] shows the benefits that
may result from the internal market in electricity, in terms of efficiency gains,
price reductions, higher standards of service and increased competitiveness.
However, important shortcomings and possibilities for improving the
functioning of the market remain, notably concrete provisions are needed to
ensure a level playing field in generation and to reduce the risks of market
dominance and predatory behaviour, ensuring non-discriminatory transmission
and distribution tariffs, through access to the network on the basis of tariffs
published prior to their entry into force, and ensuring that the rights of small
and vulnerable customers are protected and that information on energy sources

110. To this end, the EC Directive 2003/54/EC required Member States to designate regulatory
authority(s) to monitor, inter alia, “the terms, conditions and tariffs for connecting new

discriminatory, in particular taking full account of the costs and benefits of the various
renewable energy sources technologies, distributed generation and combined heat and

The EC Directive 2003/54/EC and the Law No. 39/2002 laid the foundation for many
specific regulatory decrees passed by the concerned Ministries in Italy regulating the
incentive tariff regime for renewable energy facilities, and in particular photovoltaic/solar

facilities.

112. Further to Law No. 39/2002, on 29 December 2003, Italy enacted the Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003 implementing the EC Directive 2001/77/EC (see {| 104-105 above). In this
Legislative Decree, instructions were issued to the Ministry of Productive Activities to
work with the Ministry of the Environment to establish specific criteria to incentivize
electricity produced from photovoltaic/solar energy, which was to be done by the adoption
of one or more decrees within six months of the date of entry into force of Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003. These new decrees were required to take into account many enlisted

criteria, including to “provide a specific incentive rate, decreasing amount and duration as

renewables. This raises the cost of the promotion of renewables and risks hampering both the further growth of
renewables and the completion of the internal electricity market.”)

facilities.*”
As mentioned in Law No. 39/2002, this Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 reiterated that no

incentive scheme could create greater or new burdens on the state budget.>?

Contemporaneously, the Productive Activities Committee affirmed the Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003 at the Parliament by stating, inter alia, that increasing the production of
electricity from renewable sources was an “absolute priority” in Italy, and that the same
would require a “stability of the regulatory framework which the investors shall rely on in

the medium to long term period”.**

Thereafter, on 18 April 2005, the Italian Parliament directed the implementation of the EC
Directive 2003/54/EC (see {J 109-111 above) by way of Law No. 62/2005, which, inter
alia, provided for the introduction of incentive mechanisms in the renewable energy sector
“based on tenders for the promotion of the most advanced technological solutions that are

still far from being commercially competitive”.*>

These Legislative Decrees implementing the EC Directives were followed by the
enactment of the five Ministerial Decrees, known as “Conto Energia” or “Energy
Accounts”, which established the terms and conditions for the incentive tariff regime
specifically for photovoltaic facilities. These Conto Energia Decrees are discussed
individually in this Section, and shall progressively be referred to as “First Conto
Energia”, “Second Conto Energia”, “Third Conto Energia”, “Fourth Conto Energia”,

Subsequently, the Fourth and Fifth Conto Energia Decrees were enacted by the concerned
ministries pursuant to the principles and standards established under the Romani Decree,
which was enacted to implement the EC Directive 2009/28/EC that replaced the EC
Directive 2003/54/EC (discussed in Section (4) below).°*”

(1) First Conto Energia Decree

The First Conto Energia Decree contained the first incentive tariff program and was
enacted on 28 July 2005 in furtherance of the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and Law
No. 62/2005.** It was directed towards photovoltaic facilities with individual capacity
between 1 kW and 1 MW, granting them the right to receive specific incentive tariff for
every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced.’ The cumulative threshold for granting

incentive tariffs under the First Conto Energia was initially set at 100 Mw.

The incentive tariff rates established by the First Conto Energia ranged between 0.445-
0.490 EUR/KWh, subject to the nominal capacity of the plants.°! These tariffs were to
reduce on an annual basis by 2% after 2006 based on the date of entry into operation of a
plant. Further, the duration for which these tariff rates would apply was twenty years,

subject to any adjustments based on the ISTAT inflation index.

In order to qualify for the incentive tariffs under the First Conto Energia Decree, the
photovoltaic plants had to provide preliminary project proposals for the plant in question,

including, inter alia, technical specifications, capacity and a commitment to obtain the

necessary authorizations relating to construction and operation of the plant.®* Thereafter,
the “implementing body”, which was a company called the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici
(“GSE”), i.e., the successor of GRTN,” had 90 days to communicate the outcome of the
plant operators’ preliminary project proposal by way of a formal letter.® After the letter
from GSE, the plant operators had the authorization to commence construction within 6-12
months and connect the plant to the grid within 12-24 months. GSE also entered into
contracts with the photovoltaic plants that qualified for the incentive tariffs based on a

sample agreement prescribed in this regard.°”

122. After the enactment of the First Conto Energia Decree, there was an increase in
investments and number of photovoltaic facilities overall, such that the “cumulative
capacity for all plants in respect of which an application has been submitted for the purpose
of obtaining incentive tariffs under the [First Conto Energia Decree was] in excess of 100
MW”.® Thus, on 6 February 2006, Italy amended the First Conto Energia Decree to raise
the overall threshold of 100 MW to 500 MW. This enhanced threshold capacity of 500
MW was exhausted in July 2006, after which Italy accepted another 387 MW of
photovoltaic capacity into the program of the First Conto Energia. This was followed by

the Second Conto Energia Decree.”

into operation.’”* Now, the implementing body, i.e., GSE, was to “verify compliance with
the provisions of this [D]ecree” after the preliminary project proposal was made by a plant
operator, and not already communicate the outcome concerning the tariff awarded, which

was done after the entry into operation of a plant.”

126. Second, while the minimum threshold of individual capacity of a plant to be entitled to the
incentive tariff was maintained at 1 kW by the Second Conto Energia Decree,” the upper
limit of 1 MW prescribed in the First Conto Energia (see { 119 above) was removed.
Further, the cumulative capacity threshold was increased from 500 MW to 1200 MW, with
a possibility for facilities that were connected to the grid 14 months after the date on which
Italy reached the 1200 MW threshold to also receive incentive tariffs under the Second

Conto Energia.”®

Third, the Second Conto Energia Decree introduced multiple criteria for affixing tariff
rates for any eligible photovoltaic plant facility, including the facility’s nominal capacity,
the plant’s size and architectural integration, and whether it was partially or totally
integrated into the grid.’’ Such criteria did not exist under the First Conto Energia Decree,

which considered only capacity of the plant (see { 120 above).

Fourth, the tariff rates were reduced in comparison to the First Conto Energia Decree. The
new tariff rates ranged between 0.346-0.490 EUR/kWh, which would be reduced on an

annual basis based on the date of entry into operation of a plant.’

The above aside, with respect to the duration of the incentive tariffs, the Second Conto
Energia Decree stated that “[t]he tariff identified . . . is awarded for a period of twenty
years commencing from the date of entry into operation of the plant and shall remain
constant in current currency for the entire twenty year period”.”” This was also mentioned
in the confirmation letter to be sent by the GSE to notify the plant operator of the tariff it
was awarded,®° and in the contracts to be entered into between GSE and the photovoltaic
plant operators, as was evident from the sample agreement also prescribed under the

Second Conto Energia Decree.*!

The Second Conto Energia envisaged the enactment of another decree revising the
incentive tariffs for photovoltaic plants connected to the grid after 2010.*? However, in the
interim, Legislative Decree No. 3/2010 was enacted on 25 January 2010 (“Salva Alcoa
Decree’), and converted into Law No. 129/2010 on 22 March 2010. The Salva Alcoa
Decree extended the Second Conto Energia tariffs to the plants that were built by 31

December 2010, but connected to the grid later, ie., until 30 June 2011.83 The Second

Conto Energia subjected the grid manager to penalties in the event plants were not
connected to the grid in a timely manner.** This context behind the enactment of the Salva
Alcoa Decree is reflected in the legislative history and also endorsed in Decision No.

51/2017 of the Italian Constitutional Court.®>

This was followed by GSE explaining, in a report on “Operating Procedure for Managing
Communication to GSE for Works Completion”, the various steps that photovoltaic plant
operators had to take from their end in order to ensure that there were no gaps in respect of
connection of new plants to the grid. This included the procedure for a specific request by a
plant operator for grid connection to be made to grid operators, in order to have a starting

point for the deadline for grid operators and/or manager to connect a plant to the grid.*°

132. In 2009, the installed capacity of photovoltaic facilities was double of the capacity added in
2008, and by then, Italy became the second largest photovoltaic market in the world as per

GSE’s estimate.*’

133. This, together, with further expected growth in the installed capacity, lead to the GSE
Managing Director, Mr. Nando Pasquali, stating in an interview in May 2010 that 2010
will be a “record breaking year” in the photovoltaic sector in Italy, requiring a new Conto

Energia Decree to be enacted, which will reduce the incentive tariffs further.*®

134. In June 2010, the target of 1200 MW capacity under the Second Conto Energia Decree

was reached, as mentioned in a GSE presentation of 7 July 2010.°?

(3) Third Conto Energia Decree

On 6 August 2010, the Italian Ministry for Economic Development jointly with the
Ministry for Environment enacted the Third Conto Energia Decree. The Third Conto
Energia Decree reduced the existing tariff rates due to a corresponding reduction in the
costs of photovoltaic technology since the entry into force of the Second Conto Energia.
The new tariff rates ranged between 0.251-0.402 EUR/kWh,” which were to now be
reduced on a tri-annual basis based on the date of entry into operation of a plant,°! as
opposed to the earlier annual revision provided in the Second Conto Energia (see { 128
above). This change in tariff regime was motivated, according to Respondent, by “the
evolution of photovoltaic technology recorded . . . and in particular the significant
reduction of costs components and photovoltaic systems .. . in order to respect the

principle of fair return on the costs” established by Legislative Decree No. 387/2003.°7

The Third Conto Energia Decree also introduced nuanced categories of photovoltaic plants
in order to diversify the incentive tariffs available to them. These categories included (i)
photovoltaic plants, further divided into (a) works on buildings and (b) other photovoltaic
systems; (ii) integrated photovoltaic systems with innovative features; and (iii)

concentrated photovoltaic plants, photovoltaic systems with technological innovation.”

The cumulative threshold of the capacity of photovoltaic plants admitted to the program
was increased from 1200 MW in the Second Conto Energia Decree to 3,000 MW in the
Third Conto Energia, extendable to the plants that were connected to the grid within 14

months of the date on which this threshold was reached by Italy.**

138. Similar to the previous two Conto Energia Decrees, the 20 year duration for the incentive
tariffs remained,” as did the regime for GSE to enter into contracts with the producers of

the facilities accepted under the Third Conto Energia.°°

139. The Third Conto Energia Decree was originally intended to apply to facilities that entered
into operation from 2011 to 2013, with the tariffs reducing by 6% for plants that entered
into operation in 2012 and 2013. The Third Conto Energia envisaged the enactment of a
subsequent decree establishing the rate for incentive tariffs for plants that would enter the

grid after 2013.°”

140. In January 2011, it was reported that Italy had already achieved 4.5 GW in new
photovoltaic installations in the year 2010.%* Its overall normalised electricity production

through renewable energy sources in 2010 was 69 TWh.”

(4) EC Directive 2009/28/EC and the Romani Decree

141.

In the interregnum between the Second and the Third Conto Energia Decrees, the EC
issued another significant Directive, being EC Directive 2009/28/EC on 23 April 2009 for
the promotion of use of energy from renewable sources. The EC Directive 2009/28/EC

repealed its predecessor EC Directive 2001/77/EC with effect from 1 January 2012.!°

142. The national indicative targets (see {| 104-105 above) set by the EC Directive 2001/77/EC
were thus replaced with “mandatory national overall targets” for electricity consumption

based on renewable energy in the new EC Directive 2009/28/EC.'°! Italy’s mandatory

target was to have a gross consumption of 17% through energy produced from renewable

sources by 2020.!°

143. Further, the EU’s overall target was revised from 12% to 20% of gross energy
consumption to be achieved through renewable sources by 2020, together with 10% of
transport fuels to be sourced from renewable energy. This came to be known as the EU’s
20-20-20 plan.!03 In this connection, the notable recitals of the EC Directive 2009/28/EC,

stated the following:

The Commission communication of 10 January 2007 entitled ‘Renewable
Energy Roadmap — Renewable energies in the 21st century: building a more
sustainable future’ demonstrated that a 20% target for the overall share of
energy from renewable sources and a 10% target for energy from renewable
sources in transport would be appropriate and achievable objectives, and that a
framework that includes mandatory targets should provide the business
community with the long-term stability it needs to make rational, sustainable
investments in the renewable energy sector which are capable of reducing
dependence on imported fossil fuels and boosting the use of new energy
technologies. Those targets exist in the context of the 20 % improvement in
energy efficiency by 2020.

 

For the proper functioning of national support schemes it is vital that Member
States can control the effect and costs of their national support schemes
according to their different potentials. One important means to achieve the aim
of this Directive is to guarantee the proper functioning of national support
schemes, as under Directive 2001/77/EC, in order to maintain investor
confidence and allow Member States to design effective national measures for
target compliance.!*

144. While calling upon the EU Member States to adopt national renewable energy plans, the
EC Directive 2009/28/EC required the Member States to take into account, inter alia, “the
effects of other policy measures relating to energy efficiency on final consumption of

energy” and “energy saving”.!°

Like its predecessor EC Directive 2001/77/EC, the Directive 2009/28/EC also envisaged
the possibility of “support schemes” to be established by Member States in order to
achieve their renewable energy targets.!°° By definition, these “support schemes” could
include “any instrument, scheme or mechanism applied by a Member State . . . that
promotes the use of energy from renewable sources by reducing the cost of that energy,
increasing the price at which it can be sold, or increasing, by means of a renewable energy
obligation or otherwise, the volume of such energy purchased. This includes, but is not
restricted to, investment aid, tax exemptions or reductions, tax refunds, renewable energy
obligation support schemes including those using green certificates, and direct price

support schemes including feed-in tariffs and premium payments.”!°”

In June 2010, pursuant to the EC Directive 2009/28/EC, Italy finalized a National Action
Plan to reach the EU’s revised renewable energy targets.!°° The National Action Plan
shared the burden of renewable energy consumption between the electricity, hearing,
cooling and transport sectors. Specifically for the electricity sector, the target was equal to
26.4% consumption by 2020, which would require a normalized generation of 99 TWh per
year, !0 In the National Action Plan, Italy further stated, inter alia, the following:

The current incentive systems . . . represent consolidated instruments of the

national energy system, which one can also take into consideration, with the

necessary adjustments, for the upcoming period as an important element of
continuity for the achievement of the new EU objectives.!!”

Compared with the current situation, the introduction is envisaged of certain
corrections to the existing framework, in a logic aimed at increasing energy
production, but making the support tools more efficient, in order to avoid a
parallel growth of production and of burden of the incentives.!!!

The feed-in tariff [Conto Energia] is a support scheme which guarantees
constant remuneration at current currency values for the electricity produced by
plants for a set period of time . . . Moreover, the scheme is subject to regular
adjustments which take into account the trends in the prices of energy products
and components for photovoltaic plants . . ., with the intention of limiting the
medium- and long-term costs to the community. In any case, the incentive
tariff paid when the plant becomes operation[al] remains fixed for the whole
entitlement period.!!*

147. On 3 March 2011, Italy implemented the EC Directive 2009/28/EC by way of the
Legislative Decree No. 28/2011 (“Romani Decree”). The Romani Decree specifically
envisaged the maintenance of the incentives for renewable energy, which had the purpose
of ensuring a fair remuneration or return of the investment and operating costs.'!? In this

connection, Article 24 of the Romani Decree is worth quoting, in its relevant part:

Article 24 Incentive mechanisms

(1) The production of electricity from plants using renewable sources that
enter into operation after December 31, 2012, will be promoted through
the instruments and according to the general criteria set out in paragraph
2 and the specific criteria set out in paragraphs 3 and 4. The safeguard of
non-incentivized plants is ensured through the mechanisms under art. 8
hereof.

(2) The production of electricity by the plants referred to in paragraph 1 is
supported on the basis of the following general criteria:

a) _ the incentive has the purpose of ensuring a fair remuneration of the
investment and operating costs;

b) _ the period one is entitled to receive the incentive all through is
equal to the average conventional lifecycle of specific kind of
plant, and starts from the date of entry into operation thereof;

c) the incentive remains constant throughout the support period to
which one is entitled under the law and may take into consideration
the economic value of energy produced;

With respect to the remunerations and the rate of incentives, the Romani Decree
specifically mentioned that “the period one is entitled to receive the incentive all through is
equal to the average conventional lifecycle of specific kind of plant, and starts from the

date of entry into operation thereof.”!!>

Like the Legislative Decree 387/2003, which had implemented the previous EC Directive
2001/77/EC in Italy (see {{ 112-116 above), the Romani Decree also tasked certain
ministries, i.e., the Ministry for Economic Development and the Ministry for Environment
an Sea Protection, to determine the incentive regime for renewable energy investments by
way of specific legislative decrees.'!° Notably, while Legislative Decree 387/2003 tasked
the Ministry for Productive Activities in this regard, to, inter alia, “provide a specific
incentive tariff, decreasing amount and duration as to ensure fair remuneration of each
investment and operating costs”,!'7 the Romani Decree required the concerned Ministries
to promote renewable energy on the basis of incentives that have “the purpose of ensuring

a fair remuneration of the investment and operating costs”.!!8

Further, the Romani Decree also contained other specific provisions relating to
photovoltaic energy. In this connection, the Romani Decree limited the applicability of the
Third Conto Energia to plants that were connected to the grid by 31 May 2011, as opposed
to the originally envisaged end-date of 31 December 2013. Also, the Romani Decree added
further conditions to the eligibility of plants receiving incentive tariffs, based on size,

organization, and zoning of land.'!°

Moreover, the Romani Decree added provisions relating to sanctions for investors that
submitted false declarations to GSE regarding their eligibility to receive the Conto Energia
incentive tariffs, and also generally empowered the GSE to control and monitor facilities

operating under this regime.!”°

Lastly, the Romani Decree envisaged the enactment of a new decree by the Ministry for
Economic Development establishing revised incentive tariffs for plants connected to the
grid after 31 May 2011. In this connection, it further prescribed the establishment of annual
limits for installed capacities that could benefit from the incentive tariffs, and adjustment
of tariff values based on reductions in cost of technology and equipment as well as

incentives applied in other EU Member States.'?!

It is worth noting that some photovoltaic plant operators who were unable to obtain
benefits under the Third Conto Energia Decree as a result of the Romani Decree, instituted
complaints in Italian courts against the Romani Decree and its prescription of a new tariff
regime with effect from 31 May 2011.!”7 In one of these cases, the Consiglio di Stato
decided against one such renewable energy producer, who had intended to register its
photovoltaic facilities under the Third Conto Energia Decree, but had not yet received a
written confirmation of the incentive tariffs it was entitled to from the GSE when the
Romani Decree was enacted.'?? The Consiglio di Stato made certain relevant findings,
relating to the EC Directive 2009/28/EC and the general regulatory regime concerning the
electricity market. In particular, it found, inter alia, that “the sector of renewable energies
in general and photovoltaics in particular is not a free or liberalized market, but subject to
programming, planning, targets compatible with burdens upon the users to be in fact
reduced, decreasing profitability commensurate to actual overhead and technology costs as
applied internationally.” It further noted that the EC Directive 2009/28/EC did not rule out
that “the interest in the promotion of energy production” needs to be reconciled with “the
preservation of other values of obvious internal constitutional relevance (purposes of the
national plan, respect of quotas between the various energy components, installed power,

size of the achieved flows, protection of the territory, environment and landscape.”!*

(5) Fourth Conto Energia Decree

Pursuant to the stipulations of the Romani Decree, on 5 May 2011, the Ministry for
Economic Development enacted the Fourth Conto Energia Decree.'*> The preamble of the
Fourth Conto Energia Decree mentioned that within a few years Italy would achieve “grid
parity”, i.e., a situation where generation of power through photovoltaic plants would be at

an equal or lower cost than the price of purchasing power form the electricity grid.!”°

The Fourth Conto Energia Decree applied to plants that would be connected to the grid
between 31 May 2011 and 31 December 2016.'?’ Further, for the first time, a “national
indicative installed capacity target” for photovoltaic plants was introduced, which was set
at 23 GW. The installed capacity target corresponded to a yearly indicative cumulative cost
of incentives between EUR 6 to 7 billion.'® The incentive regime was thus tied to this
yearly cumulative cost threshold, and the Ministry for Economic Development was now
entitled to revise the incentive tariffs for future plants when Italy reached the lower end of
this yearly threshold, i.e., EUR 6 billion.'?? Respondent attributes this realignment of tariff
rates to the rise in the costs of maintaining the incentive regimes under the first three Conto
Energia Decree, due to the rise in “producability” of solar energy, resulting in “excess

remuneration” being received by photovoltaic plants.'*”

Akin to its predecessors, the Fourth Conto Energia Decree also stated that the incentive
tariffs granted to qualifying photovoltaic plants would be constant for a 20 year period

starting from the date of the plant’s connection to the grid.'*! The regime relating to the

contracts entered into between GSE and producers whose plants qualified for incentives

was also maintained under the Fourth Conto Energia Decree.'*?

157. The above aside, the Fourth Conto Energia Decree was different from the previous three in

certain respects. For instance, the Fourth Conto Energia built on the nuanced distinctions
created in the Third Conto Energia Decree between different kinds of photovoltaic plants
(see { 136 above) and created a further demarcation between “small plants” and “large
plants”. “Small plants” were defined as “photovoltaic plants realised on buildings with
capacity no greater than 1000 kW, any other photovoltaic plants with capacity no greater
than 200 kW, operating according to the net-metering scheme (regime di scambio sul
posto), and photovoltaic plants with any capacity realised on buildings and in areas owned
by the Public Administrations under article 1 (2) of [L]egislative [D]ecree [N]o. 165,
2001”.'*? “Large plants” were any photovoltaic plant other than the ones which were

“small plants”.'3+

158. In this regard, the Fourth Conto Energia Decree established other checks and controls on

the entitlement of incentive tariffs in order to regulate the costs. For instance, a registry for
“large plants” was established, which was to be maintained by the GSE.'** Further,
photovoltaic plant operators were now required to “notify GSE about completion of works
for the realisation of the plant, enclosing a certified expert report certifying compliance

with” certain requirements contained in Annex 3-B to this Conto Energia.'*°

Tf a plant
enrolled in the register fell with the cost threshold envisaged under the Fourth Conto
Energia, but had not provided such a certificate of completion of works, its registration

was considered forfeited.'°7 Also, the Fourth Conto Energia Decree established different

tariff limits for the “large plants” for every semester, beyond which limit the incentive

tariffs would no longer be available for new facilities during that semester.'**

The Fourth Conto Energia Decree had foreseen that the total cost would likely reach EUR
3.5 billion per annum by 2011.'*° By the end of 2011, Italy had reportedly added over 4.3
GW of additional installed photovoltaic capacity under the Fourth Conto Energia,'*° and
by early 2012, Italy was approaching the cost threshold of the Fourth Conto Energia, i.e.,
EUR 6 billion.'*! In light of the cost threshold being reached, Italy was entitled by the
Fourth Conto Energia Decree to revise incentive tariffs, and this was done by the

enactment of the Fifth Conto Energia Decree.

(6) Fifth Conto Energia Decree

On 5 July 2012, the Italian Ministry for Economic Development enacted the Fifth and last
Conto Energia Decree, which was to enter into force 45 days after a resolution by the
Italian Electrical Energy Authority that the cost threshold of EUR 6 billion for incentive
tariffs under the Fourth Conto Energia Decree was reached.'*? That resolution was issued

on 12 July 2012.4
In light of the technological progress and decrease in cost of photovoltaic plants and a

corresponding increase in the number of plants connected to the grid, the renewable energy

production, by the end of 2011, was at 94 TWh, i.e., only 6 TWh short of the 2020 target

set by the EU.'*4 Accordingly, the Fifth Conto Energia Decree reduced the cost threshold

of incentive tariffs to EUR 700 million per year.'*°

In this connection, the Fifth Conto Energia Decree provided for two different incentive
regimes based on the photovoltaic plants’ capacities. The first regime applied to plants up
to the 1 MW capacity, and awarded them an “all-inclusive tariff’, which included the price
of the electricity and the value of the incentive.'4° The second regime applied to plants of
capacity exceeding 1 MW, and awarded them an amount equal to the difference between
the all-inclusive tariff and the market price of electricity plus the revenues deriving from
the sale of the energy to the market.'47 In addition, all plants, regardless of their capacity

were entitled to a bonus tariff on the electricity produced and consumed by them.'4*

The Fifth Conto Energia Decree was similar to its predecessors inasmuch as the incentive
tariffs therein also applied for a period of 20 years. The contracts to be executed between
the GSE and the producers also retained a similar form, except in respect of a specific

stipulation entitling GSE to unilaterally modify the contracts. '*

Lastly, the Fifth Conto Energia Decree stated that it would cease to apply to new
photovoltaic plants 30 days after a resolution by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority that
the cost threshold of EUR 700 million (bringing the total cost to EUR 6.7 billion per year)
for incentive tariffs was reached.!*° This resolution was passed on 6 June 2013, and after 6
June 2013, no incentive tariffs were made available by Italy to any new photovoltaic plant

installed and connected to the grid.!>! The rise towards this total cost threshold of EUR 6.7

Cc. OFF-TAKE REGIME AND MINIMUM GUARANTEED PRICE

167. In addition to the Conto Energia based incentive regime, Italy created another regime,
through Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, by virtue of which grid managers and GSE were
required to purchase all electricity injected into the grid by renewable energy producers, if

the producers so requested.!*4

168. This regime, categorized by the Parties as the “off-take regime”, operated in the alternative
to or to the exclusion of the free market prices.'** It entitled eligible producers, specifically
renewable energy producers with capacity under 10 MW, to benefit from a fixed price per

kilowatt at which they could sell their electricity to grid managers and/or the GSE.!°°

169. The Italian Electrical Energy Authority was tasked with establishing the modalities of this

7

regime,'°’ and further to this, it laid down principles for this regime primarily in

Resolutions No. 34/2005 and 280/2007.'** Each of these Resolutions was preceded by a
consultation process initiated through Consultative Documents dated 20 October 2005 and

4 July 2007 respectively, by which comments of the stakeholders were invited.'>?

170. By way of Resolution No. 34/2005, a minimum price was guaranteed for small
photovoltaic plants (together with hydroelectric plants and other renewable energy plants)
with the capacity up to 1 MW to ensure the coverage of their production costs.!© This
Resolution applied only to the first two million kWh of electricity produced and injected

into the grid by such plants.

171. Thereafter, in the interim, Resolution No. 317/2006 was passed by the Italian Electrical

Energy Authority, which sought to propose revised values of minimum guaranteed prices,
based, inter alia, on consultations with some producer groups in relation to factors such as
production costs of electricity from renewable sources, the implementation of the incentive

tariff regime etc.!°!

172. This was followed by Resolution 280/2007, which replaced Resolution 34/2005.

Resolution 280/2007 confirmed this minimum guaranteed price regime for photovoltaic
plants contained in its predecessor. In particular, Resolution 280/2007 provided that from
2008 onwards, the minimum guaranteed price would be revised each year and
distinguished based on the source of the renewable energy, so as to account for the

peculiarities of each kind of renewable energy facility.'®

173. Further, Resolution 280/2007 implemented the compensation regime for situations where

the free market price of the electricity rose higher than the minimum guaranteed price, in
which case GSE was obliged to pay the difference between the two to the producers.!°
Accordingly, the minimum guaranteed price was the hourly zonal price that was
determined on a daily basis further to negotiations within the Italian Power Exchange.'™
Respondent categorizes GSE’s role in this regime as that of a “commercial broker between

the producer and the other operators within the electricity system”.!°

174. The motivation behind this minimum guaranteed price regime was “to ensure the economic

survival of the smaller plants . . . even if market prices were to fall significantly”, and to

“provide dedicated simplifications” of the market by virtue of guaranteed remunerations.!°

175. In furtherance of Resolution 280/2007, GSE entered into agreements with each qualifying

agreements were valid for one-year terms renewable automatically unless the producers

indicated otherwise.”

176. In 2011, this Italian Electrical Energy Authority issued Resolution No. 103/2011, which
was preceded by a consultation process similar to the ones conducted for Resolutions No.
34/2005 and 280/2007.'® Resolution No. 103/2011 sought to differentiate the minimum
guaranteed prices between different power plants based on the source of renewable energy

with effect from 2012.!°

177. For the interim period, Resolution No. 103/2011 fixed a “basic” minimum guaranteed price
of EUR 76.2/MWh.'” This “basic” minimum guaranteed price was the price for electricity
purchased after the first 25,000 kWh and until 2 MWh. The minimum guaranteed price
was higher for the first 3750 kWh of electricity purchased (100 EUR/MWh) and then
progressively reduced for the electricity purchased between 3750 kWh and 25,000 kWh
(90 EUR/MWh).!7! Other than that, Resolution No. 103/2011 maintained the minimum

guaranteed price regime as per the earlier situation with a provision for annual review.

178. The Romani Decree, which was enacted on 3 March 2011, i.e., a few months prior to
Resolution No. 103/2011 (mentioned in {J 141-152 above), also contained a provision

relating to this regime of minimum guaranteed prices, which provided as follows:

[B]y 31 December 2012, on the basis of the Ministry of Economic
Development’s guidelines, the [Italian Electrical Energy Authority] defines the
minimum guaranteed prices, that is the integration of the revenues deriving
from the participation to the electric market, in relation to the production of
renewable energy systems which continue to be operated without incentives
and for which . . . the production’s safeguard is not ensured by the participation
to the market.!”

RESOLUTION 111/06 REGARDING IMBALANCE COSTS

In order to prevent an imbalance between the supply and demand of electricity, Italy
maintained some reserve capacity from gas-fired turbines that could increase and decrease
production rapidly subject to the demand. In order to regulate the costs of maintaining such

reserve capacity of energy,!”*

the Italian Electrical Energy Authority passed a Resolution
on 9 June 2006 (“Resolution 111/06”), which required energy producers to provide in
advance a projected figure of the amount of electricity they could inject into the grid. In the
event that a producer deviated from its injection projections, it was required to pay what
were known as “imbalance costs” or “imbalance compensation” under this Resolution
111/06.'7° In this connection, the following provisions of the Resolution 111/06 are
important to note:

39.2. In the event in which the actual imbalance for a dispatching point in a

relevant period were to be negative, the dispatching user pays . . . an actual

imbalance compensation for the electric energy purchased within the ambit of
the dispatching service.

40.4. The imbalance compensation for the measurement of the negative actual
imbalances of which in paragraph 40.1, letter b), is equal:

(a) in each relevant period in which the aggregate imbalance by zone is
positive, to the assessment price of the sales offers accepted in the market on
the day before the relevant period in the zone in which the dispatching point
is located;

(b) in each relevant period in which the aggregate imbalance by zone is
negative, to the maximum value of the following:

(i) the highest price among those of the sales offers accepted in the
market for the dispatching service for the purposes of balancing in real

time in that relevant period, in the zone in which the dispatch point is
located, and

ii) the measurement price of the sales offers accepted in the market on the
preceding day in the relevant period, in the same zone.!7°

In respect of “non-programmable renewable energy sources”, Resolution 111/06

mentioned the following:

40.6. For the dispatching points by production unit powered by non-
programmable renewable energy sources, as well as for the import or export
dispatching points relating to electric frontiers belonging to a connection
network for which there is no implemented verification of the programmed
exchanges, the imbalance compensation is equal to the assessment price of the
sales offers of electric energy accepted in the market_on the day before the
relevant period and in the zone in which the dispatch point is located.!””
(emphasis added)

182. In essence, renewable energy producers were effectively exempted from paying imbalance

costs under this regime because of their non-programmable nature.'’* Further, the Parties
agree that until 2012, all imbalance costs were passed on to end-consumers via electricity

bills under Italy’s socialized electricity regime.'”

187. Mr. Ryan Shockley explains this joint venture relationship in his Witness Statement on
behalf of Claimants, dated 28 July 2017, in the following terms:
Discussions between the two companies took place over many months and
resulted in the execution of a Framework Agreement in May 2010. For its part,
First Reserve agreed to commit US $150 million to renewable energy projects
in the targeted countries. SunEdison would propose specific renewable energy
projects to be included in the joint venture i.e., that SunEdison would construct
and that a joint venture company would then purchase and, by the time the
framework agreement was concluded, SunEdison had developed an impressive
list of potential projects.'*°
188. The First, Second and Third Claimants were amongst the joint venture companies created
to acquire and develop photovoltaic projects pursuant to the above described
arrangement.'®” The joint venture companies envisaged investments in various countries,
including the United States and Canada,'** but 50% of the total capital investments was to
be used in Italy due to the favourable conditions created by the Conto Energia regime and
the off-take and minimum guaranteed price regime.'*? It is in reliance of this regime that

Claimants contend they began investing in Italy’s photovoltaic energy market.

(2) First Claimant’s Investments

189. Between 2010 and 2011, the First Claimant, i.e., SunReserve Luxco Holdings SARL,
acquired a total of seven photovoltaic plants in Italy, which constituted a portfolio of 27.7

MW. In this process, according to Claimants, the First Claimant invested more than EUR
61 million.!°

190. The acquisition of the seven photovoltaic plants by the First Claimant was done in four
batches. Each of these acquisitions was a result of the First Claimant acquiring the special

purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) that had developed and/or was operating the photovoltaic plant

ITALY’S MEASURES AFTER THE FIFTH CONTO ENERGIA FROM 2012 TO 2014

As mentioned in Section B(6) above, the Fifth Conto Energia Decree was enacted on 5
July 2012, and provided for a cost threshold of incentive tariffs upto EUR 700 million per
year, so as to reach the total cost of EUR 6.7 billion for the incentive program. In this
connection, the Preamble of the Fifth Conto Energia contained the following relevant
recitals:
Ir BEING HELD that, due to the high level of charges accrued and the state of
and prospects for technologies, it is sufficient to commit a further 700 million
€/year approximately in incentive costs, for the purpose of accompanying
[photovoltaic] energy in its progress towards competitiveness, outside the
scope of support schemes. This amount will cover charges for plants on the
register, those which access tariffs freely and plants which become operational
during transitional periods ...??°
According to the report of Claimants’ regulatory expert, FTI Consulting, Italy surpassed
the level of photovoltaic production projected for 2020, by 2012 itself, i-e., 8 years in

advance of the objective.?*°

From 2012 onwards, i.e., since and including the enactment of the Fifth Conto Energia
Decree, until 2014, Italy undertook certain additional administrative and/or fiscal
measures, which are under challenge by Claimants, and thus, a subject of dispute between
the Parties. In brief, these measures include (1) an Administrative Management Fee
imposed on photovoltaic energy producers; (2) changes to the Minimum Guaranteed Prices
under the Off-Take Regime; (3) an obligation on the photovoltaic energy producers to pay
“imbalance costs”; (4) the resolution of domestic complaints relating to one “Robin Hood

Tax”; and (5) the classification of photovoltaic plants as “immovable property”.

(1) Administrative Management Fee in the Fifth Conto Energia

Together with provisions relating to the incentive tariff regime, the Fifth Conto Energia
also contained a provision requiring photovoltaic energy producers to pay an annual
administrative fee of EUR 0.0005/kWh of incentivized energy (“Administrative

Management Fee”). This provision applied, as of 1 January 2013, to all photovoltaic
energy producers benefitting from the incentive tariffs under any of the Conto Energia
Decrees. It stated the following:
To cover GSE management costs, and the cost of checks and controls by GSE,
the plant operators that access incentive tariffs under this decree and decrees
issued in implementation of article 7 of legislative decree no. 387, 2003 [Off-
Take Regime] and article 25 (10) of legislative decree no. 28, 2011 [Romani
Decree], are under an obligation, commencing from 1 January 2013, to pay
GSE a contribution of 0.05 euro cents for each kWh of subsidised energy, also
by means of offset with incentives owed.?*!
Articles 10.5 and 10.6 of the Fifth Conto Energia provided that GSE will specify “the
application rules for . . . access to the incentive tariffs under this decree” and “[t]he
procedures for payment of the contributions”. Pursuant to this, GSE clarified on its website
in 2013 that the annual Administrative Management Fee shall be offset against GSE’s first

payment of incentive tariffs to any producer in a given year.?**

This policy decision to impose Administrative Management Fee found a mention in the
subsequently enacted Spalma-incentivi Decree dated 24 June 2014? as well (discussed in
Section IV.G below). In particular, Articles 25(1) and 25(2) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree

provided, in their relevant part, as follows:

Article 25(1): Charges incurred by the GSE for the conduct of management,
audit and control activities, related to the incentive and support mechanisms,
are to be borne by the beneficiaries of the same activities ....

Article 25(2)(3): Within 60 days from the date of entry into force of this
Legislative Decree, and every three years thereafter, the GSE proposes to the
Minister of economic development the size of tariffs for the activities referred
to in paragraph | to be applied as from 1 January 2015 and valid for three
years. Rates are set by the GSE on the basis of costs, of planning and of
development forecasts of the same activities. The proposal includes the
methods of payment of the fees.?**

Further, the GSE submitted a report to the Ministry for Economic Development on 21

August 2014, wherein it estimated, according to Respondent, that the Administrative

Management Fee would constitute 0.17% of the incentives received by the beneficiaries

under the Fifth Conto Energia.?*>

(2) Changes to the Minimum Guaranteed Price under Off-Take Regime

As mentioned in Section IV.C above, Italy had established an Off-Take Regime, which
constituted, inter alia, a minimum guaranteed price for electricity produced by small
photovoltaic plants with capacity up to 1 MW. This entitlement to a minimum guaranteed
price operated in conjunction with the incentive regime under the Conto Energia Decrees,
except in respect of the all-inclusive tariff provided for in the Fifth Conto Energia, which
Respondent submits was incompatible with the minimum guaranteed price regime.”*° The
modalities of this Off-Take Regime were formulated by the Italian Electrical Energy

Authority, which fixed the minimum guaranteed price on a yearly basis.

In this connection, the Italian Electrical Energy Authority established the minimum
guaranteed price for the year 2013 as EUR 105.8/MWh up to 3,750 kWh of annual energy
purchase; EUR 95.2/MWh for annual energy purchase between 3,750 kWh to 25,000 kWh;
and EUR 80.6/MWh for annual energy purchase from 25,000 kWh to 2,000,000 kWh.237

In the meantime, the Italian Electrical Energy Authority had invited Politecnico di Milano
to prepare a report based on (i) the analysis of average electricity production costs from
different sources of renewable energy, depending on data from power plants with a
capacity up to | MW, and (ii) the analysis on the scale of progressive brackets that could
be used to ensure coverage of operating costs and fuel costs for each source. The data
relating to operating costs and fuel costs was provided by electricity producer associations
in Italy, including, inter alia, Assoelettrica,*® which Claimants contest was incomplete and

unclear.” The report was prepared by Politecnico di Milano in July 2013, and provided,

inter alia, that operating costs are only significant in comparison to the market electricity
prices in the case of very small scale power plants such as household installations upto 3

kW, and not for the medium scale or large scale power plants.”“?

221. Thereafter, on 31 October 2013, the Italian Electrical Energy Authority issued a document
for public consultation bearing No. 486, inviting the stakeholders’ comments by 25
November 2013.74! The public consultation document proposed a new formula for the
calculation of minimum guaranteed prices amounting to the average operating costs of
renewable energy facilities plus 8%. Applying this formula, Claimants submit that the
minimum guaranteed price for photovoltaic plants would be EUR 37.8 per MWh of

electricity produced.”4”

222. This public consultation document was followed by a Resolution No. 618/2013/R/EFR
dated 19 December 2013 by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority (“Resolution 618”).
This Resolution revised the minimum guaranteed price for photovoltaic plants with a
capacity beyond 20 kW for the year 2014 to EUR 38.9/MWh, i.e., applying a 10% increase
of the average operating costs, which were calculated as 35 EUR/MWh.”* The press
release corresponding to this Resolution 618 stated that “the consumer prices index for

families and workers has increased by 1.1% in 2013 compared to 2012.”244

223. Further, the Resolution 618 stated that limited the minimum guaranteed prices to the first
1.5 million kWh of energy purchased per year (instead of the earlier threshold of 2 million
kWh per year). On a related note, the distribution based on the amount of electricity
purchased, resulting in a progressive decrease of the minimum guaranteed price (see {| 219

above), and consequently a “basic” minimum guaranteed price (see { 177 above), was

This was followed by minimum guaranteed prices for 2015 and 2016 to be established at
39 EUR/MWh.™° According to Claimants, the minimum guaranteed prices established by
the Italian Electrical Energy Authority for photovoltaic plants since 2014 onwards were

lower than the average market price of electricity.?*”

Four days after Resolution 618 was issued by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority, the
Italian Government enacted the Legislative Decree No. 145/2013, which was known as the
Destinazione Italia (“Destinazione Italia”). This Legislative Decree, inter alia, provided
that the minimum guaranteed price for all photovoltaic plants benefiting from the Conto
Energia Decrees would be equal to the hourly zonal price, with the exception for

photovoltaic plants with a capacity below 100 kw.748

The Destinazione Italia was subjected to criticism by the President of the Italian Electrical
Energy Authority, Mr. Guido Bortoni, and by Members of Parliament, during a session
discussing the enactment of the Decree.? For instance, Mr. Bortoni mentioned the

following in a speech before the Parliament:

The Legislative Decree, instead, provides for the minimum guaranteed prices
to be always equal to the energy market prices, thus basically neutralizing the
goals for which [the minimum guaranteed prices] had been introduced in the
first place. These measures would require deep analysis of costs. Additionally,
this measure might compromise the economic balance of those plants only
partially benefiting from support regimes (as for example in case of repowering
or revamping) which would be excluded from the application of minimum
guaranteed prices in relation to the entire quantity of energy generated. In

conclusion, in light of the foregoing considerations, we ask to restore the
framework existing before the issue of the Legislative Decree.?°°
On 21 February 2014, the Destinazione Italia was enacted into Law No. 9/2014 by the
Parliament establishing the minimum guaranteed price regime established under the

Destinazione Italia.?>!

Thereafter, on 17 April 2014, the Italian Electrical Energy Authority issued Resolution
179/2014, which envisaged that the minimum guaranteed price would be allocated for the
first 1.5 million kWh of electricity purchased by photovoltaic plants having a capacity
above 100 kw.??

(3) The Imbalance Costs

As mentioned in Section IV.D above, the “imbalance costs” that renewable energy
producers were required to pay in Italy was equal to the market price of energy on the day

before the relevant period and in the zone in which the dispatch point was located.”°?

With respect to these “imbalance costs”, the Italian Electrical Energy Authority passed a
Resolution 281/2012/R/EFR on 5 July 2012 (“Resolution 281”). In this Resolution 281, it
was, inter alia, mentioned that the treatment of “non-programmable renewable energy
sources” in respect of the obligation to pay “imbalance costs” should be equated with the
treatment “provided for other production units not entitled to participation in the Market

for Dispatching Services”.*>+

This implied that the non-programmable renewable energy power plants would have to pay
imbalance costs over and above the hourly zonal price (which was the previously fixed

imbalance costs as mentioned in {| 182 above) if the “modified and corrected binding

program” was 20% beyond the amount of electricity actually fed into the grid.** The
“modified and corrected binding program” refers to the amount of electricity that the
dispatching user undertook to feed into the grid (as against the amount of electricity

actually fed into the grid).?°°

232. Resolution 281 also provided for a “scouting period of at least 6-12 months” before the
same was appropriately implemented.”*’ In this regard, on 22 November 2012, Resolution
281 was followed by a Resolution 493/2012/R/EFR issued by the Italian Electrical Energy
Authority (“Resolution 493”). This Resolution 493, inter alia, provided for “the modalities
of allocation of the imbalance compensation and payments covering the administrative

costs to be attributed to the producers”.?>*

233. Both these Resolutions, i.e., Resolutions 281 and 493 were challenged by renewable
energy producers before Italian administrative courts. On 9 June 2014, the Consiglio di
Stato, Italy’s highest administrative court ruled, in its Decision No. 2936/2014, that
Resolution 281 was unlawful in part. In particular, in the following passage, it found that
the Resolution discriminated against non-programmable renewable energy by treating it in

the same way as other kinds of energy:

Non-programmable sources of electricity production are characterized by the
fact that, while it is not objectively impossible to predict the [amount of]
energy produced and fed into the grid, this prediction cannot reach the same
level of precision as for programmable sources, by reason of the type of source
and the variables that condition its operation . . . the first judge . . . has affirmed
that the imposition of such costs must take account of the specificity of the
source.?>?

234. Further, in the following passage, the Consiglio di Stato clarified the scope of its findings

on discrimination:

The foregoing does not mean that the imbalance costs caused by these
production units should, as it was the case in the previous regime, be

socialized. This mechanism would lend itself to similar criticisms, as would
achieve discrimination between operators to the benefit, not so clearly
justifiable, of those who produce programmable energy.

The economic and technical regulatory power by the Authority must, therefore,
be exercised in a manner that permits to reach a solution that, on the one hand,
could protect the market in its entirety by imposing imbalance costs also to the
production units in question [nonprogrammable sources], and, on the other,
could introduce calibrated mechanisms, based on the specificity of the source,
that could take into account the methods of electricity production and the
resulting difficulties in making a prediction as to input into the grid, which
could achieve the same degree of reliability that the programmable energy
production units must guarantee.?
After this decision by the Consiglio di Stato, GSE apparently reimbursed certain sums
wrongfully charged to renewable energy producers under Resolutions 281 and 493, but did

not reimburse all such wrongfully charged sums.”°!

Subsequently, the Italian Electrical Energy Authority passed another Resolution
522/2014/R/EEL on 23 October 2014 (“Resolution 522”), which also pertained to a
regulation of imbalance costs in respect of non-programmable renewable energy producers.
In this connection, Resolution 522 provided the following:
The production units fed by non-programmable renewable sources must be
subject to regulation of imbalances . . . the burdens deriving from the
imbalances imputable to nonprogrammable renewable sources must not be
socialized in order to avoid unjustifiable discrimination, and in order not to
continue to allocate burdens on the community . . . it is appropriate to review
the guidelines on imbalances for non-programmable renewable sources on the
basis of the second option presented in the document . . .2
Pursuant to Resolution 522, dispatching users were given the option to choose between two
courses of action. First, they could chose to pay imbalance costs based on regulations
already in force for other unauthorized production units, and in turn, to modify their market
supply strategies accordingly. Alternatively, they could chose to apply the new regulations
that were specifically aimed at non-programmable renewable energy sources having

created distinct bands for different sources of renewable energy with the option of

commercial aggregation.” For photovoltaic plants, the band constituted a threshold for the

modified and corrected binding program as 31%.7*+

Further to Resolution 522, renewable energy producers continue to pay new imbalance
costs since 1 January 2015 onwards.?° Respondent relies on data until 31 December 2015
to state that 66% of the dispatching points associated with renewable energy producers
have opted for the first option mentioned in { 237 above, in order to pay imbalance

costs.26¢

(4) The Robin Hood Tax and Constitutional Court Proceedings

By way of Legislative Decree No. 112/2008 dated 25 June 2008, which was converted into
Law No. 133/2008 on 6 August 2008, Italy imposed taxes on windfall profits of oil, gas
and other traditional energy companies, known as the “Robin Hood Tax” This was done by
increasing the corporate income tax rate for companies with an annual gross income of
over EUR 25 million to 33% from the original 27.5%.°°’ The rate of corporate income tax
was further increased in July 2009 to 34% by Law No. 99/2009." According to
contemporaneous press reports, the Robin Hood Tax was motivated to tap the hike in

prices of traditional energy sources, such as oil and gas.

In respect of renewable energy producers, Legislative Decree No. 112/2008 provided that
“[t]he same disposition does not apply to subjects producing electricity by primarily using
biomass and solar-photovoltaic and wind energy sources”.°”° The Italian Revenue Agency
had further confirmed in a Circular No. 35/E dated 18 June 2010 that “the application of

the supplement is excluded for subjects which simultaneously . . . primarily produce

electricity from renewable sources, using biomass and solar-photovoltaic or wind sources,
with respect to the total amount of energy produced.”?”! The exclusion of renewable
energy producers from Legislative Decree No. 112/2008 is not disputed in these
proceedings, except to the extent that Italy argues that this exclusion was based on certain

conditions.?””

On 13 August 2011, Italy passed the Legislative Decree No. 138/2011, which was
converted into Law No. 148/2011 on 14 September 2011. This Law made, inter alia, two
amendments to the scheme of Law No. 133/2008. First, it extended the scope of the Robin
Hood Tax to also apply to renewable energy producers by deleting the stipulation
excluding the renewable energy producers from the Robin Hood Tax. Second, it increased
the corporate income tax rate from 34% to 38%, and reduced the threshold gross annual
income required for coverage by the Robin Hood Tax to an annual income of EUR 10
million (and taxable income of over EUR | million), as opposed to the original EUR 25

million.?”3

This was followed in June 2013, by Italy further extending the scope of the Robin Hood
Tax through Legislative Decree No. 69/2013, which was converted into Law No. 98/2013
dated 9 August 2013." In particular, by this amendment to the Legislative Decree No.
112/2008, the threshold gross annual income required for coverage by the Robin Hood Tax
was further reduced to EUR 3 million (and taxable income of over EUR 300,000).?”> After
this extension of the Robin Hood Tax, Claimants’ photovoltaic plants also fell within its

purview, which was not the case previously.

Thereafter, renewable energy producers challenged the constitutionality of such extensions

of the Robin Hood Tax before the Italian Constitutional Court.

On 11 February 2015, the Italian Constitutional Court rendered its Decision No. 10/2015

declaring the Robin Hood Tax as unconstitutional (“Decision No. 10/2015”). In this

connection, the Constitutional Court specifically declared the “unconstitutionality of

Article 81, paragraphs 16, 17 and 18, of [Legislative Decree] No. 112 of June 25, 2008”.776

The motivation behind the Constitutional Court’s Decision No. 10/2015 was, inter alia,
“the incongruity of the means conceived by the legislature to the aim pursued”.?”” This
incongruity was, in turn, premised on the ground that the legislature established an increase
of the corporate income tax that affected the whole income of an entity being taxed,
without the support of “a mechanism making it possible to tax separately only a part of the

income eventually connected to those activities pursued by the taxpayer”.?”*

Further, the Constitutional Court, in the following passage, found that the measure in
question, i.e., the Robin Hood Tax, was violative of the requirement of ensuring that the

entities in question have the “capacity to contribute” the taxes being assessed:

Under Article 53 of the Constitution, the capacity to contribute (“capacita
contributiva”’) represents the precondition and the limit to the taxation powers
of the State and, at the same time, the duty of the taxpayer to take its share of
the public expenditure, having to interpret this principle as a_ sectoral
specification of the broader principle of equality under Article 3 of the
Constitution . It is true that this Court has repeatedly stressed that “the
Constitution does not impose a uniform taxation, with absolutely identical
criteria and proportional for all types of tax”; rather it demands “an unfailing
link with the ability to contribute, in a system framework informed to criteria
of progression, as a further articulation, in the specific field of taxation, of the
principle of equality, connected to the duty to remove the economic and social
obstacles factually limiting the freedom and equality of citizens-human beings,
in a spirit of political, economic and social solidarity (arts. 2 and 3 of the
Constitution) . . . [A]ny diversification of the tax system, for economic areas or
by type of taxpayers, must be supported by adequate justification, without
which the differentiation might become arbitrary discrimination.?”

247. aln respect of the temporal scope of its Decision No. 10/2015, the Constitutional Court
ruled that its Decision would not have retroactive effect.?*° The rationale behind this
finding of non-retroactivity was provided, inter alia, in the following terms:

The role entrusted to the Court as the guardian of the Constitution in its entirety
requires avoiding constitutional declarations of illegality that determine,
paradoxically, “effects even more incompatible with the Constitution”... of
those that have led to declare unconstitutional the provision at stake. To avoid
this, it is the duty of the Court to modulate its own decisions, even in terms of
time, so as to avoid that the affirmation of a constitutional principle determines
the sacrifice of another.7*!

248. Following the Constitutional Court Decision No. 10/2015, Claimants, amongst other
similar producers, were allegedly not reimbursed the amounts they had paid as Robin Hood
Tax, nor were these amounts set off against future payments. Further, Italy confirmed by
its Circular No. 18/E of 28 April 2015 that renewable energy producers would have to pay
the Robin Hood Tax for the fiscal year 2014.78?

(5) Classification of Photovoltaic Plants as “Immovable Property”

249. On 19 December 2013, Italy issued a Circular No. 36/E that classified the majority of
photovoltaic plants as “immovable property”? Such classification as “immovable
property” impacted the overall tax liability of photovoltaic plant owners, since for
immovable properties the applicable depreciation rate was 4% instead of the 9% they
previously used as movable property. Further, it impacted the municipal charges that

photovoltaic plant owners had to pay, since they were now subjected to an additional

municipal charge on buildings (“IMU Charge” and charges relating to municipal

services such as road maintenance and public lighting (“TASI Charge”).”*>

The Parties dispute whether Circular No. 36/E was a reversal of the traditional position,
whereby photovoltaic plants were considered “movable property”, which Claimants
contend,?*° or whether Circular No. 36/E was only a non-contradictory clarification of the
existing legal regime in Italy, which Respondent argues.”*” In this connection, the previous
circulars issued by the Revenue Agency assume relevance.** These circulars defined
movable property as something that is not fixed into the ground and can be easily moved to
another seat. Photovoltaic “systems” were considered to fall within the category of
movable property,”*° to the extent they constituted plants and machinery that can be

“removed and placed in another place, while maintaining their original features”.”°°

Also relevant is a Resolution 3/T dated 6 November 2008 by the Agency for Territory,
which clarified that photovoltaic panels qualify as immovable property, since “the

substantial nature of the power plant” qualify as such for cadastral categories.”?!

Respondent considers that the Circular No. 36/E only confirmed the above understanding
of movable and immovable properties in Italian fiscal and cadastral regimes, and was, in

22 the

turn, in line with Italian Corti di Cassazione or the Constitutional Court’s case law,
OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital 2014 and the Italian Legislative

Decree No. 44/2005.7%

Thereafter, Italy’s 2016 Budget Law altered the classification of photovoltaic plants again,
and according to Claimants, brought it almost in line with the position prior to the 2013
Circular No. 36/E. Pursuant to this, as of 1 January 2016, the determination of the value of

THE SPALMA-INCENTIVI DECREE AND THE EVENTS THEREAFTER

Contemporaneous with the above described administrative and/or fiscal measures, Italy
had enacted the Destinazione Italia Legislative Decree (discussed in {| 225-227), which

was converted into law on 21 February 2014.27

In addition to modulating the minimum guaranteed price regime, the Destinazione Italia
also gave renewable energy power plant operators who were benefiting from incentive
regimes such as green certificates, all-inclusive feed-in tariffs or premium tariffs, the
option between (i) continuing the existing incentive scheme for the 20 year period without
any additional benefits after the expiration of this period; and (ii) accepting a reduced
percentage of tariff incentives under the Conto Energia Decrees, in exchange for an
extension in the duration of the incentive period by seven years.”°* This option was
introduced in the Destinazione Italia “[f]or the purpose of containing the annual burden on
prices and on the electric rates of the incentives for renewable energy and for the purpose

of maximizing the medium-long term production contribution from the existing power

plants”. Claimants contend that few, if any, investors accepted this offer for a remodulation

of tariffs under the Destinazione Italia.”

257. Six months after the Detinazione Italia, on 24 June 2014, Italy enacted the Legislative
Decree No. 91/2014 and converted it into law by Law No. 116/2014 on 11 August 2014
(“Spalma-incentivi Decree”). The Spalma-incentivi Decree is discussed in (1) below,
followed by (2) a discussion of the Italian Constitutional Court’s decision in relation to the

Spalma-incentivi Decree, and (3) the events following the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

(1) The Spalma-incentivi Decree

258. The Spalma-incentivi Decree sought to, inter alia, “remodulate” the incentive tariffs under
the Conto Energia Decree, and to provide for altered “modalities” for disbursement of the
incentive tariffs “[s]tarting from 1 January 2015”.*° This, according to Article 26(1) of the
Spalma-incentivi Decree, was “[i]n order to optimize the management of the timing for the
gathering and the disbursement of the incentive tariffs and for the purpose of implementing
a better sustainability of the renewable energy support policy”.*”! In addition, Article 23(1)
of the Spalma-incentivi Decree stated that the Decree was motivated towards achieving “a
more equitable distribution of the tariff burden among the various categories of energy
consumers” and accordingly reducing “electricity rates for customers of medium voltage

serve to decrease costs of electricity for “residential customers and public lighting”,*™* nor
was a drop in electricity consumption a “relevant” motivation behind the Spalma-incentivi
Decree.**> On the contrary, Respondent categorizes the Spalma-incentivi Decree as a “fine-
tuning” of the tariff regime, which was a non-discriminatory and prospective policy choice
within the State’s regulatory powers. As per Respondent, this was motivated by legitimate
considerations relating to the rise in the A3 Component of the total electricity costs borne

by the end consumers attributable to the incentive tariffs.*°°

260. The A3 Component of the total electricity costs was projected, by the GSE, to reduce from
EUR 6.7 billion in 2013 (see {J 164-165) to EUR 6.05 billion by 2018 as a result of the
Spalma-incentivi Decree.*°’ On a related note, a decision was issued by the Corte dei Conti
in Italy in November 2015, which had highlighted the delays in payment of the amounts
pertaining to the A3 Component. In this regard, the decision stated that such delays “take
the GSE to undertake a greater risk for the fulfilment of all payments to producers of
electricity from renewable energy sources, and the consequent ned to resort to credit lines
of GSE . . . leaving the Company without the necessary financial flexibility to deal with

possible additional requirements.”*°*

261.

The Spalma-incentivi Decree’s remodulation of the incentive tariff regime was applicable
for photovoltaic plants with a capacity above 200 kW, which constituted 4% of the total
beneficiaries under the Conto Energia scheme, but amounted to 60% of the total

expenditure relating to the incentives.*” This remodulation of the incentive tariff regime

came in the form of three options provided to the photovoltaic plant operators, which they

could choose from:

(i) | The first option provided under the Spalma-incentivi spread out reduced incentive

tariffs over a period of 24 years starting from the entry into operation of a

photovoltaic plant, instead of the original 20 year period. The incentive tariffs would

be reduced pursuant to a percentage of reduction set out in the following table:

(ii) The second option maintained the original 20 year period of incentive tariffs, but

prescribed a remodulation of the incentive tariffs by dividing the tariffs between “a

first period in which a reduced incentive tariff is disbursed”, i.e. between 2015-2019;

and “a second period in which the incentive tariffs [shall be] equally incremented”.*!!

adhesion of all the producers to this option, of at least [EUR] 600 [mlillion for the
period 2015-2019"?

These remodulation percentages were prescribed in the Decree of the Ministry for
Economic Development dated 17 October 2014.7!7 On 27 October 2014, the GSE’s
website published the “Tables containing the values of the coefficients of
remodulation (1-Xi) to be multiplied with the previous incentives . . . in the event of
selection of option b) identified in Article 26, paragraph 3, Law No. 116 of August
11, 2014”.3'4 Based on these Tables, for the years 2015-2019, the remodulation
percentages range from 68.61% of the original tariff under the Conto Energia tariff
regime, for photovoltaic plants having 11 years out of the 20 year incentive period
remaining, to 90.30% for photovoltaic plants having 19 years or more remaining.
Correspondingly, during the last five years of the 20 year incentive period, the
remodulation percentages range from 131.39% of the original tariff under the Conto
Energia tariff regime, for photovoltaic plants having 11 years of these 20 years
remaining, to 109.70% of the original tariff for photovoltaic plants having 19 years

or more remaining.*!>

The third option also maintained the original 20 year incentive period, but prescribed
for a progressive reduction of incentive tariffs for the residual incentive period based
on the capacity of a photovoltaic plant. This progressive reduction was stipulated in

the following terms:
(a) 6% for photovoltaic plants having a capacity between 200 and 500 kW;

The Spalma-incentivi Decree granted the photovoltaic plant operators until 30 November
2014 to communicate to the GSE which of the above three options they select. The
Spalma-incentivi Decree also mentioned that “[iJn the absence of a communication from
the producer”, the default option that shall be applied by the GSE is the third one.*!7 It was
estimated that this remodulation of the incentive tariff regime would bring about savings to

the total cost of the incentive regime in the amount of EUR 420 million per year.?!®

Based on data provided by the GSE, Respondent submits that by 30 November 2014,
37.29% photovoltaic plant operators chose the second option of tariff remodulation,
whereas 1.39% chose the first option. To all the remaining plants, the third option was
assigned by default.*'? All of Claimants’ photovoltaic plants were assigned the third option

by default.

In addition to the above tariff remodulation scheme, the Spalma-incentivi Decree also

provided for the following options to the photovoltaic plant operators:

The recipients of the incentive tariffs mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 may
access to bank loans amounting up to the difference between the expected
incentive tariff as of 31 December 2014 and the remodulated incentive tariff
pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4. Such loans can benefit, cumulatively or
alternatively, on the basis of agreements with the banking system, of funding or
guarantees by Cassa depositi e prestiti S.p.A.. 7°

The recipients of long-term incentive tariffs, however named, for the

production of renewable energy, can sell up to 80% of such incentives to a

buyer selected amongst the “primary European financial players”.*??

265. The Spalma-incentivi Decree also brought about alterations in payment modalities.
Whereas previously the GSE would pay incentive tariffs to photovoltaic plant operators on
a monthly basis, at least for plants with capacity over 20 kW, based on the plant’s actual

production,*?

the Spalma-incentivi Decree provided that from the second semester of
2014, the GSE would pay tariffs in monthly instalments of 90% of the plant’s estimated
yearly average production. Thereafter, the GSE would make the requisite adjustments by

30 June of the following year.?*+

266. Moreover, the Spalma-incentivi Decree, together with a Decree of the Minister of
Economic Development dated 24 December 2014, altered the Administrative Management
Fee of EUR 0.0005/kWh of incentivized energy prescribed in the Fifth Conto Energia (see
Section F(1) above). It was estimated that this alteration in the Administrative Management
Fee would bring about savings to the total cost of the incentive regime in the amount of
EUR 30 million per year. The Administrative Management Fee was made contingent on

the photovoltaic plant’s capacity in the following terms:

(a) 2.20 EUR/kW for photovoltaic plants having a capacity between 3 and 6 kW;
(b) 2 EUR/kW for photovoltaic plants having a capacity between 6 and 20 kW;

(c) 1.80 EUR/kW for photovoltaic plants having a capacity between 20 and 200

267. In addition the above major changes, the Spalma-incentivi Decree also introduced other
regulatory alterations, such as (i) introduction of a contribution of 5% to the system costs
for power plants having capacity between 20 to 500 kW operating under the “regime of

exchange in proximity”;*”° (ii) revision of the remuneration of electrical systems in the

electricity tariff enjoyed by the Italian Railway Network S.p.A to the effect of savings in

the total cost estimated at EUR 80 million.?7

268. After these measures were introduced in the Spalma-incentivi, a cumulative savings of
almost EUR 2.7 billion on electricity bills was recorded by the Ministry for Economic
Development, of which approximately EUR 1.7 billion were for the benefit of small and
medium enterprises (with an average percentage decrease of 8.5% for small voltage
enterprises and of 10% for the medium voltage enterprises) and the remaining EUR 1

during discussions surrounding the enactment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree.**? In this
regard, one of the senators, Senator Piccoli, mentioned the following in respect of the

alteration of the regime under the Conto Energia Decree:

Intervention on the photovoltaic, by changing the terms of the agreements
between the State and individuals, implies less credibility and worst
international reputation . . . in the eyes of investors, then we cannot forget that
many disputes are predictable both internal and in international fora. Indeed,
such a mechanism . . . seems to conflict with the protection of investment
forecasts contained in the European Energy Charter Treaty.***

270. Similarly, Senator Arrigoni criticized the Spalma-incentivi Decree stating that it had “three
negative features: it is retroactive, discriminatory, and likely to be challenged as it violates
essentially the certainty of international and national law and thus the credibility of our

country before Italians and foreign investors . . .”**

(2) The Italian Constitutional Court Decision

271. On 24 January 2017, the Italian Constitutional Court released its Decision No. 16/2017
originally dated 7 December 2016 on the legitimacy of Articles 26(2) and 26(3) of the

Spalma-incentivi Decree (“Constitutional Court Decision”).*°>

272. Renewable energy producers challenged the constitutionality of these provisions of the
Spalma-incentivi Decree, on the ground that they were contrary to Articles 3 and 41 of the
Italian Constitution, “for violation on the principle of reliance on firm grounds of
advantage, recognized by agreements qualified as of ‘private law’” and for “their

the sector”.**° As per Respondent, these involved issues relating to legitimate expectations,

reasonableness and equality and lack of proportionality.**”

273. The Constitutional Court denied the challenges to the constitutionality of Articles 26(2)
and 26(3) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree. Notable findings of the Constitutional Court
Decision, in this regard, were, inter alia, as follows:

As a matter of principle, the reliance of citizens in legal certainty is “a
fundamental and indispensable element of the rule of law . .. However — as the
firm case-law of this Court, in coherence also with that of the ECtHR, has
clarified — protection of reliance does not entail, in our legal system, that the
legislature may not enact provisions which change unfavorably the regulation
of long-term relationships, and this even if their object are perfect legal rights .
. . The only exception is, in matters of criminal law, that of the prohibition of
retroactive norms, set by article 25, second para., of the Constitution’. It
remains firm that such provisions, “as any other legal norm, must not result in
an irrational regulation, arbitrarily effecting substantial rights created by the
previous law, frustrating in such way also the reliance of citizens in legal
certainty”...

The analysis of the ratio of the contested norm excludes that it has
unreasonably and unforeseeably affected the long-term relations, arising from
the agreements reached by the percipients of the incentives with GSE, therefore
violating the principle of legal certainty.

In fact, the legislature in 2014 has intervened in a general context in which, on
the one hand, the remuneration of incentivizing fees for energy produced
through photovoltaic apparatus was gradually increasing, taking into account
both the costs of production as a result of the considerable technological
development of the sector, and the overall European framework. But on the
other hand, and correlatively, one registered the growing economic burden of
such incentives on the final users of electric energy, especially on SMEs which
are the fabric of national industry.***

274. Further, in respect of the GSE contracts and the reliance placed by renewable energy
producers on them, the Constitutional Court, inter alia, found:

[T]he guarantee of stability of the incentive for all the due period does not
imply, however, as a necessary consequence, that the measure should remain

unchanged for 20 years, unchanged and unaffected by the variations which are
common to long-term contracts.

This is even truer if one considers that the agreements reached with GSE
cannot be qualified as contracts meant to determine the exclusive profit of the
operator, with terms and conditions blocked at the initial conditions, for twenty
years, even if technological conditions may change profoundly. They are
instead regulatory instruments, aimed at reaching the objective of incentivizing
certain sources of energy in equilibrium with other sources of renewable
energy, and with the minimum sacrifice for the users who ultimately bear the
economic burden.>”

(3) Events following the Spalma-incentivi Decree

275. Claimants’ position is that the reduction of incentive tariffs had a “dramatic impact”, and
resulted in a reduction in value of Claimants’ investments by 19%, and when coupled with
the other regulatory measures taken by Italy, the reduction in value amounted to 27%.*#°
This allegedly resulted, inter alia, in Claimants having to restructure the debts they had
undertaken for financing their investments, and also impacted the payment of dividends to
investors. In this connection, Claimants’ witness, Mr. Mark Florian states as follows:

Indeed, prior to Italy’s retroactive amendment of the tariff regime, we had been
distributing dividends to our investors, as expected when we made the original
investment. The tariff reduction eliminated our ability to pay any substantive
dividends and made it difficult, without a restructuring, to pay the debt service
payments on the PV plants. This change eliminated any substantive return to
our investors on the investment, and put the ability to even return the capital
invested in the PV plants at substantial risk.**!

276. Ultimately, in 2016, Claimants’ parent company (SunReserve International, LP, created by
SunEdison and FirstReserve as discussed in Section E(1) above) decided to sell the entire

investment portfolio in photovoltaic plants in Italy. Claimants concluded this sale in

August 2016, while specifically reserving and retaining their ownership over the present

ECT claim against Italy.*4?

Prior to this, on 4 May 2016, Claimants sent a letter to Respondent notifying it of the
dispute, and inviting it to settle the dispute amicably.* Absent any amicable settlement,

Claimants proceeded to commence these arbitration proceedings.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND RELIEFS SOUGHT

In these arbitration proceedings, Claimants claim that Respondent breached the ECT by
first promising fixed incentive tariffs under the Conto Energia regime and consistent
minimum guaranteed prices under the off-take regime, and subsequently, backing out of its
promises by undertaking various regulatory measures culminating in the Spalma-incentivi

Decree that came into effect on 1 January 2015.

Claimants claim that Italy’s actions resulted in a breach of the ECT on three counts: (i)
failure to grant Claimants’ investments fair and equitable treatment, (ii) impairing
Claimants’ investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, and (iii) violating the

ECT’s Umbrella Clause.

Using the Date of Assessment of 1 January 2015, Claimants updated assessment of

damages, including interest, is EUR 40.89 million.*“+
In their SoC and SoRy, Claimants request the Tribunal to issue an Award containing the
following relief:

(a) a declaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute;

(b) a declaration that Italy has violated the Energy Charter Treaty and international

Tribunal to:

(a) Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the ECT does not cover intra-EU
disputes.

(b) Alternatively, decline jurisdiction over the totality of claims, since:

- Some of the attacked measures are exempted under Article 21
ECT;

- No amicable solution has been attempted for some further
measures; and

- The exclusivity forum choice contained in the GSE Agreements
bans this Tribunal from judging under the Umbrella Clause.

(c) In a further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the
Claimants’ alleged interests since these are barred from seeking relief, as
they did not seek amicable solution for a number of claims.

(d) Should the Tribunal consider to have jurisdiction over the case and that
claims are either totally or partially admissible, declare on the merits that:
- The Respondent did not violate Article 10(1) ECT, first and second

sentence, since it did not fail to grant fair and equitable treatment to
the Claimants’ investment.

- The Respondent did not violate Article 10(1) ECT, fourth sentence,
either, since it always adopted reasonable and non-discriminatory
measures to affect Claimants’ investment.

- Article 10(1) ECT, last sentence (the so-called “Umbrella Clause”)
does not apply in the case at stake, or, alternatively, that the
Respondent did not violate it neither through statutory or regulatory
measures, nor the GSE Conventions.

- Consequently, declare that no compensation is due.

(e) In the unfortunate event that the Tribunal were to recognize legitimacy to
one of the Claimants’ griefs:

- Declare that damages were not adequately proved.

- In addition, declare that both the methods for calculation and
calculation itself of damages proposed by the Claimants are
inappropriate and erroneous.

- Order the Claimant[s] to pay all relevant expenses and
disbursements by the Respondent because of these proceedings in

agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

(a) The possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty;
or

(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

Respondent raised the jurisdictional objection relating to the ECT’s non-application to
intra-EU disputes in its Statement of Defence for the first time. However, prior to any other
submissions by the Parties on this jurisdictional objection, the ECJ released the ECJ
Judgment in Case C-284/16, Slowakische Republik v Achmea BV on 6 March 2018 (see {
32 above). Thereafter, the Parties’ submissions dealt with this jurisdictional objection
taking into account considerations arising out of the ECJ Judgment. Since the Parties’
submissions relating to the ECJ Judgment reflect their most recent position on the issues
relating to EU law, the Tribunal considers them to have updated their prior submissions
taking into account the ECJ Judgment, and shall primarily focus on those more recent

submissions in the following Sections.

(1) Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s position is that the ECJ Judgment is of direct relevance in these proceedings,
and that the Judgment confirms the lack of jurisdiction of tribunals under Article 26 ECT

in intra-EU investment disputes.

a. Applicable Law

According to Respondent, EU law is part of or a “subsystem” of international law, and its
rules and principles assume relevance in international law due to the principle of primacy
or primauté of EU law. Thus, it has to be applied by a tribunal established pursuant to
Article 26 ECT, “both with regard to the validity of the arbitration agreement and its
merits”. Further, as per Respondent, EU law also applies as part of the national law of EU

Member States.*”?

With respect to the applicable law to jurisdictional issues, while Respondent primarily
considers that cases in the ICSID regime are similar to cases such as the present one, being
administered by the SCC with the seat in Stockholm, Respondent, in the alternative,
endorses this distinction. This is on the ground that awards rendered in the latter kind of
regime, i.e., with their seat in Stockholm, will have to be considered under EU public
order, when being reviewed by annulment courts in Sweden or enforcing courts under the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (“New
York Convention”). As per Respondent, the ECJ Judgment forms part of the EU public
order, and thus any award not in compliance with the same could be annulled for being

contrary to the basic principles of the Swedish legal system (see {| 315 below).*°°

b. The Reasoning of the ECJ Judgment applies to ECT

It is Respondent’s position that the offer of a Member State to an investor to arbitrate
disputes as per Article 26 ECT is “exactly identical” to the situation of Article 8 of

Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the

Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (“Slovak-
Dutch BIT”) 25!

295. What is relevant in the present case is that the obligations that Italy assumed towards
Luxembourg are in the nature of intra-EU obligations. The bilateral nature of these
obligations, and consequently the offer to arbitrate, is not altered either by the fact that the

ECT is a multilateral treaty, or by the fact that the EU is a party to the ECT.*>?

296. Respondent contends that the ECJ Judgment has confirmed the proposition that any
agreement entered into between Member States has to respect the autonomy of the EU
legal order. This autonomy requires that dispute resolution in respect of intra-EU rights and
obligations be carried out by bodies that can make a reference to the ECJ for a preliminary
ruling on questions of interpretation and application of EU law, as per Article 267 TFEU,
in order to preserve the monopoly of the ECJ on matters of EU law, and in turn, the full
effectiveness of EU law. Such bodies would constitute only courts and tribunals of EU
Member States, which are state-established permanent institutions capable of deciding
disputes with res judicata effect, even those relating to the ECT. These do not include
arbitral tribunals of the nature sitting under the ECT. Not only can such tribunals not make
a reference to the ECJ, but their awards, upon being rendered, are also subjected only to
very limited grounds of review by courts. Thus, even under the ECT, as under the Slovak-
Dutch BIT, the Member States established a mechanism of settling investment disputes

that is not capable of ensuring the proper application or full effectiveness of EU law.**

297. Respondent supports its submissions by relying on recent blog articles that have endorsed
the extension of the reasoning of the ECJ Judgment to ECT cases.**+ Respondent also

EU Member States dated 15-16 January 2019 as confirmation that the principles
established in the ECJ Judgment were not specifically linked to the Slovak-Dutch BIT and
also extend to the ECT. Respondent considers these Declarations, specifically the one Italy
signed on 15 January 2019, to hold binding value.*° Further, in Respondent’s view, all
previous arbitral case law that has rejected the argument that intra-EU BITs and application
of the ECT in the intra-EU context is incompatible with the TFEU, is rendered irelevant in

light of a final judgment on this proposition rendered by the ECJ.**°

According to Respondent, the application of the ECJ Judgment to intra-EU ECT cases is
not inhibited by either (i) the absence of a disconnection clause, which was unnecessary as
per Respondent, or (ii) the presence of the EU as a party to the ECT, which only reinforces

the applicability of the ECJ Judgment to ECT, in Respondent’s view.**’

With respect to the opinion of Advocate General Wathelet dated 19 September 2017
preceding the ECJ Judgment (“AG Opinion”), Italy’s argument is that the AG Opinion
does not hold any more than pure academic or scholarly value after the ECJ Judgment has
already decided the relevant issues. As per Italy, in any event, the AG Opinion was based
on the wrong assumption of arbitral tribunals, on certain occasions, being able to refer
questions for the preliminary ruling of the ECJ under Article 267 TFEU, which possibility

has been definitively ruled out by the ECJ Judgment.***

Respondent also criticizes the recent award rendered in Masdar v. Spain, whereby the
tribunal assumed jurisdiction over an intra-EU investment dispute under the ECT after the
ECJ Judgment was rendered. Respondent’s criticism focuses on the fact that the Masdar

tribunal did not account for how the ECJ Judgment’s reasoning extends also to multilateral

treaties such as the ECT, and placed excessive reliance on the AG Opinion.**? In this
connection, Respondent points out that the questions referred to the ECJ, the principles
relied on by the ECJ to arrive at its conclusions and the issues addressed by the ECJ,
specifically about the characteristics of EU law, all apply equally to multilateral
conventions. Further, a tribunal “such as” the one established under Article 8 Slovak-Dutch
BIT includes the present Tribunal sitting under the ECT, since it operates within a
comparable procedural framework, in particular relating to the law applicable to its

procedure and the judicial review and finality of its award.*°

c.  Intra-EU Arbitration is in violation of Articles 267 and 344
TFEU and the general autonomy of EU law
Respondent’s position is that arbitration under the ECT of intra-EU investment disputes
violates Article 267 and 344 TFEU and the general principle of autonomy of EU law, the
consequence of which is that the Member State’s offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT

becomes inapplicable vis-a-vis investors of another Member State.**!

According to
Respondent, as a result of the sui generis nature of EU law and its primacy in the EU legal
order, Member States are prevented from allowing a dispute that potentially involves EU
law aspects to be resolved by an international arbitral tribunal. The appropriate forum,
instead, would be competent national court or tribunal in the Italian Republic, which could
decide disputes relating to the EU law contained either in the primary or secondary EU

legislations.*°

In this connection, Respondent posits two arguments concerning the relationship between
EU law and the ECT. First, Respondent contends that it is possible to interpret the ECT, as

per international law, as not applying between EU Member States. Second, in the

alternative, any conflict between the ECT and EU law should, in Respondent’s view, be

resolved in favour of EU law.3%

With respect to the interpretation of the ECT, Respondent relies on Articles 31 and 32 of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (“WCLT”), and on the principle of
harmonious interpretation. Respondent highlights five provisions of the ECT, i.e., Article
1(2) (definition of “Contracting Party”), Article 1(3) (definition of “Regional Economic
Integration Organisation”), Article 1(10) (definition of “Area”), Article 25 (Economic

Integration Agreements) and Article 16 (Relation to Other Agreements).

Concerning Articles 1(2), 1(3) and 1(10) ECT, Respondent contends that given that the
ECT itself recognizes Regional Economic Integration Organisations (“REIO”) as
Contracting Parties and also envisages an overlap of territories between the REIO and its
Member States, the allocation of competences within an REIO, such as the EU, is not a

question of geographical boundaries, but instead one of substantive competences.**

Concerning Article 25 ECT, Respondent argues that the definition of an Economic
Integration Agreement (“EIA”) perfectly fits the EU, and that more preferential treatment

between the Parties to such EIAs is compatible with the ECT*°

In addition, relying on Article 16 ECT, Italy argues that nothing in Part III or V of the ECT
can be construed to derogate from any provision of EU law, specifically the Treaty of the
European Union (“TEU”) and the TFEU (referred to together as the “EU Treaties”), or
any right to dispute resolution therein. This is on the ground that the system of investment
protection established under EU law is “doubtless more favourable and offers more
articulated forms of protection to the investors and their investments” than the ECT. Even
when it comes to access to justice, while the option of international arbitration is not

available to EU citizens against EU Member States, EU citizens are entitled to non-

discriminatory and consistent court jurisdiction across the EU, and are also entitled to the

final recourse of the ECJ.3°

In support of the above interpretative arguments, Italy relies on context offered by (i) the
Decision, included in Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter
Conference, with respect to Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 ECT, which offers investors from
non-Member States of an EIA access to treatment accorded under the EIA when the said
investors have a registered office, central administration or principle place of business in
the Area of a party to that EIA; and (ii) the EU and its Member States’ declaration with
respect to Article 25 ECT.*”

Further, Italy produces preparatory works and documents relating to the circumstances of
adoption of the ECT, including contemporaneous EU Directives in the energy sector, to
contend that the ECT was never formulated to regulate the EU internal market.** In the
same vein, it relies on investment arbitration case law to reflect the consistency in judicial
behaviour and practice of EU Member States on this issue. Concerning the findings of
these investment arbitration case law, which Claimants rely on extensively (see { 319
below), Respondent submits that none of the published awards or decisions have addressed

systematically all the relevant issued under international law.>”°

Respondent’s alternative argument proceeds under the assumption of a conflict between
the ECT and EU law, specifically the EU Treaties. In this connection, Respondent
contends that EU Treaties, as they stand after amendment by the Lisbon Treaty in
December 2007, prevail over the ECT, as per (i) the conflict rule of primacy of EU law; (ii)
Article 30 VCLT, and/or (iii) Article 16 ECT.

With respect to the Lisbon Treaty, Respondent explains the allocation of competences
between the EU and its Member States, pointing out that Article 207 TFEU, which defines

the “common commercial policy” now includes foreign direct investment after the Lisbon
Treaty’s entry into force. Whereas a number of matters covered in the ECT still have
mixed competences of the EU and/or its Member States, the EU has exclusive competence

over the common commercial policy, and specifically, foreign direct investment.*”!

311.

Respondent argues that the principle of primacy of EU law is a “specific conflict rule”
under the public international law that follows from Article 351(1) TFEU. This principle
applies to give priority to the EU Treaties regardless of the bilateral or multilateral

character of the ECT or the fact that the EU is a party to the ECT.7””

312. In Respondent’s view, as a result of the subsequent entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it
is lex posterior and prevails over the ECT with respect to EU Member States as per
Articles 30(3) and 30(4) VCLT. In this connection, Respondent advocates for a liberal
interpretation of “same subject matter” in Article 30 VCLT, and goes on to explain the

protections available to investors under the EU legal regime.*”*

313. The same result is arrived at, as per Respondent, if one applies Article 16 ECT as a conflict
tule. This is on the ground, as mentioned above, that EU law provides for a more
favourable and more articulated level of protection to the investors than the ECT, in light
of, inter alia, the internal market rules, the principle of non-discrimination of nationals, the
Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the case law of the ECJ.*” Lastly, Respondent, in any
event, submits that the Lisbon Treaty amounts to a modification of the ECT as per Article

In general, in addition to the above, Respondent expresses its agreement with the

observations made by the EC in the EC NDP Submission.*”°

d. Non-enforceability of Award rendered contrary to the ECJ
Judgment
It is Respondent’s submission that any award assuming jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes
under the ECT would not be enforceable within the EU, be it awards rendered within or
outside the EU, or rendered under an institutional (ICSID or SCC) or ad hoc setting. As per
Respondent, there is no diversification based on where such an award is ultimately
rendered or under which set of procedural rules. In this connection, Respondent cites the
decisions of the EC against Spain and Czech Republic, wherein it was clearly stated that
awards rendered by tribunals under the ECT in intra-EU cases constitute State aids to be
authorized by the EC before being executed. Further, Respondent also relies on the stay of
enforcement granted by the Swedish Court of Appeal based on the ECJ Judgment in
Novenergia II v. Spain. Lastly, Respondent argues that any award non-compliant with EU
law could be at risk of a potential annulment based on Articles 33(1) and 33(2) of the
Swedish Arbitration Act (SFS 1999:116) (“Swedish Arbitration Act”) (see § 293

above).°””

(2) Claimants’ Position
a. Applicable Law

According to Claimants, the applicable law for the Tribunal does not include EU law. In
this connection, Claimants contend that Article 26(6) ECT can only be interpreted as
referring to the substantive rules governing the Tribunal’s analysis of Italy’s liability, and
does not address the applicable law to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal’s
jurisdiction is governed only by the provisions of the ECT, specifically Article 26 thereof,

and nothing beyond. Claimants alternatively submit that even if Article 26(6) ECT were

relevant for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the phrase “applicable rules and principles of
international law” only covers public international law and does not encompass a regional
legal order such as EU law. Further, as per Claimants, EU law does not apply in the present
case since Claimants have specifically chosen to bring claims under the ECT and not under
EU law. In addition, Claimants state that EU law cannot be used as general principles of

international law under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.*8

317. In this connection, Claimants also maintain that the outcome does not differ between cases
in the ICSID regime and cases being administered by the SCC or ad hoc arbitrations under
the UNCITRAL Rules. Under Swedish law, which applies as the /ex arbitri in the present
case, there is no external principle that would limit this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and any
question of jurisdiction would have to be answered with reference to the arbitration

agreement alone.*””

b. — This Tribunal has jurisdiction over intra-EU investment cases
under the ECT

318. Claimants dispute Respondent’s submissions relating to the interpretation of the ECT, and
its alternative argument relating to the resolution of any conflict between the ECT and EU
Jaw in favour of the latter. Claimants also disagree with the observations made by the EC

in this connection.

319. In respect of the interpretation of the ECT, Claimants emphasise the plain letter of the ECT
confirms that it applies to intra-EU disputes. The distinction between intra-EU and extra-
EU disputes that Respondent attempts to read into the ECT does not exist in its text, which,

as per Claimants provides no limitations concerning investors from certain Contracting

Parties not being able to resolve disputes against certain other Contracting Parties. Further,
in the instant case, neither the home State, i.e., Luxembourg, nor the host State, i.e., Italy,
could have made any reservations to the ECT as a result of Article 46 ECT. Claimants also
mention the absence of a specific disconnection clause in the ECT, which was originally
envisaged, but never included, during the treaty drafting process of the ECT. Similarly,
Claimants contest Respondent’s reliance on Article 16 ECT, emphasising that due to the
option of international arbitration provided to investors in the ECT, the same is more
favourable than the legal regime under EU law. Claimants support their arguments by
relying on “unanimous” ECT case law, i.e., 24 decisions and/or awards rendered by ECT

tribunals that have rejected jurisdictional objections relating to EU law.**°

320. With respect to the EU’s position as an REIO in the ECT, Claimants contend that the ECT
only recognizes that some Member States are also members of regional organizations,
while ensuring that the Member States are distinguished from the REIO’s independent
candidacy as a party to the ECT.**!

321. Similarly, Claimants consider Respondent’s arguments relating to Article 25 ECT and the
Decision, included in Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter
Conference, with respect to Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 ECT (see { 307 above), to be
“misplaced”. This is on the ground that Article 25 ECT does not address how EU Member
States should treat investors from other EU Member States, nor does the said Decision
require anything other than a parity of treatment by EU Member States for investors from
within the EU and investors from outside the EU, who maintain business activities within

the BU.3*

322. Claimants also rebut Respondent’s alternative argument relating to the resolution of any
conflict between the ECT and EU law (see {{{ 309-313 above). In this connection,
Claimants contend, at the outset, that the ECT and EU law, specifically the EU Treaties

after the Lisbon Treaty, do not share the same subject matter.***

323. Claimants alternatively also submit that even assuming that the EU Treaties and the ECT
had the same subject matter, the former would not prevail over the latter as per Articles
30(3) and 30(4) VCLT, since there was no incompatibility between the substantive
protections of the ECT and EU law. Similarly, the Lisbon Treaty could not be considered a
modification of the ECT under Article 41 VCLT, since a “deactivation” of investor
protection between Italy and Luxembourg would eliminate the rights of these Member
States (being exercised by investors) under the ECT. Further, Claimants emphasise on the
absence of any concrete intention to modify the ECT, which could also have been done
through the process for amendment prescribed in Article 42 ECT. Claimants question

pointing out that at least five EU Member States intervened and supported the position that

EU law did not bar intra-EU arbitration during the proceedings surrounding the ECJ

Judgment.***

324. Lastly, Claimants dispute Respondent’s understanding of Article 16 ECT’s conflict rule, on
the ground that the ECT offers a stronger level of investor protection, as exemplified
primarily by the right to resolve disputes by international arbitration under Article 26 ECT,
which is a fundamental protection not available in EU law. This is also true for substantive
protections, for which Claimants rely on the proposals in the AG Opinion and on instances
where domestic courts have denied violations of investors’ rights, which have subsequently
been upheld by investment tribunals.**° Similarly, Claimants contest the EC’s reliance on
Article 351 TFEU as a conflict rule (see {| 347 above), on the ground that it applies only to
agreements concluded prior to 1 January 1958 or before a Member State’s date of

accession into the EU, which does not include the ECT in the instant case.°8°

Judgment cannot enter the Tribunal’s applicable law framework through any “backdoor”,
much less through Article 26(6) ECT, since this provision is neither relevant for the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, nor includes the ECJ Judgment, or EU law in general (see { 316

above).°°”

Second, Claimants submit that the reasoning of each of the 23 investment tribunals, which
denied the EU law related jurisdictional objection under the ECT prior to the ECJ
Judgment (see { 319 above), continues to hold value even after the ECJ Judgment.***
Further, Claimants rely on all decisions or awards rendered after the ECJ Judgment, which
have rejected the jurisdictional objections relating to EU law, and in particular place

reliance on Greentech v. Italy.*®?

Third, in Claimants’ view, even in the alternative that the ECJ Judgment forms part of the
applicable law to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the same is clearly distinguishable from the

instant case for two reasons.

Firstly, the ECJ Judgment restricts its own application to BITs concluded “between” EU
Member States, and accordingly does not apply to multilateral investment treaties,
especially those to which the EU itself is a party. The ECT is such a multilateral
agreement, having 54 signatories, in addition to the EU itself. As per Claimants, the ECJ
Judgment did not condemn resolution of disputes arising from investment treaties through
international arbitration per se, but only precluded such international arbitration when the
EU was not party to the underlying agreement or treaty. Claimants contend that the EC

cannot ague on these lines now when the EU had already signed the ECT in 1997. In this

Secondly, the ECJ Judgment was rendered in the context of the governing law provision of
the Slovak-Dutch BIT, contained in Article 8(6) thereof, which was different from Article
26(6) ECT. Article 8(6) Slovak-Dutch BIT left open the scope for the tribunal in Achmea v.
Slovakia to interpret and apply EU law, by including the “law in force of the Contracting
Party concerned” and “other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties” in the
applicable law framework. As per Claimants, these broad stipulations in Article 8(6)
Slovak-Dutch BIT do not exist in Article 26(6) ECT, since the same only covers rules and

principles of international law as the applicable law in ECT arbitrations.*?!

Claimants support the above arguments by relying on the recent award of the tribunal in
Masdar v. Spain, which denied the relevance of the ECJ Judgment on its jurisdiction under
the ECT, stating that the same had “no bearing” and “cannot be applied to, multilateral

382 Ty addition, Claimant

treaties, such as the ECT, to which the EU itself is a party’
submits that any extension of the ECJ Judgment to the ECT is inhibited by the presence of

Article 16 ECT, which ensures that the ECT prevails over the EU Treaties.3°
d. The Tribunal need not be concerned with the future
enforceability of the Award

Lastly, Claimants contend that due to the recency of the ECJ Judgment, its specific impact
upon the actual enforcement of awards is uncertain and clouded by numerous unresolved
questions. In any event, any such impact on enforcement of awards is likely to be “minimal

to non-existent” as per Claimants.

In this connection, Claimants seek to distinguish the procedural framework of these

arbitration proceedings from the procedural framework of an ICSID arbitration. This is on

the ground that the present arbitration proceedings are governed by the Swedish law on
arbitration (Stockholm being the seat) and the New York Convention. The latter instrument
mandates signatory states to confirm and execute foreign arbitral awards with only a few
limited exceptions, which, in Claimants’ view, Italy has not established. Thus, whether and
to what extent Italy’s obligation under the New York Convention may subsequently
conflict with any of its obligations under the EU Treaties are not questions that should
concern the Tribunal at this stage. Accordingly, this Tribunal need not predict or speculate

about the enforceability of its ultimate Award.*°*

On a related note, Claimants challenge Respondent’s reliance on the EC’s communications
to Spain and Czech Republic regarding the ECT awards constituting State aids to be
authorized by the EC before being executed (see J 315 above). In Claimants’ view, these
communications are irrelevant to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and also do not impact the
merits of these proceedings, which have been brought under the ECT and not under EU
Jaw. Claimants point to a number of arbitral awards that have awarded relief to investors
aggrieved by Spanish measures after the EC’s communication to Spain relating to state aid.
Claimants also submit, in this regard, that neither has Italy reported its incentive regime
regarding photovoltaic energy to the EC as constituting state aid, nor has the EC initiated a
state aid review of the incentive regimes in Italy, despite having been aware of the same

since 2008.75

In any event, Claimants argue that any award rendered by this Tribunal upholding
jurisdiction will not carry the risk of being annulled pursuant to Sections 33(1) and 33(2) of
the Swedish Arbitration Act, since (i) investor-State disputes are considered arbitrable in
Swedish law; and (ii) intra-EU investor-State arbitration is not contrary to the basic

principles of Swedish law, as is implicitly confirmed by the Declaration of the

Cc. THE EC’S OBSERVATIONS

336. In this Section, the Tribunal summarises the EC’s observations regarding (i) the
applicability of EU law for the Tribunal’s assessment of its jurisdiction; (ii) the
implications of the ECJ Judgment for these proceedings; and (iii) the interaction between

the ECT and EU law, specifically the EU Treaties.

(1) Applicability of EU law for the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction

337. In the EC’s view, EU law forms part of the “applicable rules and principles of international
law” under Article 26(6) ECT, and the “relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties” pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. The EC states that
nothing in the ECT indicates that it operates as lex specialis vis-a-vis EU law. Rather,
reference to EU law should form a part of the task of interpretation of the ECT pursuant to
Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. For this proposition, the EC relies on Article 38 of the Statute of
the International Court of Justice, the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice
and academic writing. Incidentally, the EC also states that EU law is applicable also as the

national law of EU Member States.*?”

338. Further, according to the EC, the fact that EU law is part of international law, and is
therefore applicable as such under Article 26(6) ECT for matters of validity of the

arbitration and the merits, has not been disputed by investment arbitral tribunals after the

award in Electrabel v. Hungary. The disputed issue between tribunals instead concerns

whether the ECT prevails over EU law or vice-versa.*”

339. In this regard, the EC’s position is that the process of “systemic coherence” requires the
ECT to be interpreted in such a way as to avoid any conflict with EU law, and not the other
way around. For that purpose, according to the EC, an interpretation of Article 26 ECT
taking into account the general principle of autonomy of EU law (Articles 4(3) and 19 TEU
and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU) leads to the conclusion that there is no offer to arbitrate

by Germany to Swedish investors.*”?

(2) Implications of the ECJ Judgment

340. In the EC’s view, the ECJ Judgment, which confirms the position that the EC took in the
EC Intervention Application, renders the offer to arbitrate in Article 26 ECT
“precluded”.4° According to the EC, this is on the ground of the general principle of EU
law of autonomy of the EU legal order, which is enshrined in the liberally interpreted
Article 344 TFEU, and on the keystone of the EU judicial system, i.e., the preliminary
ruling procedure, provided in Article 267 TFEU. In addition, the EC relies on Articles 4(3)
and 19 TEU for the principle of autonomy of EU law.*°!

341.

It is the EC’s position that the ECJ Judgment applies equally to intra-EU investor-State
arbitrations under the ECT since (i) intra-EU investment arbitral tribunals are not “national
courts or tribunals” in the sense of Article 267 TFEU, which proposition applies to
tribunals under the ECT as well, regardless of whether the tribunal is an ICSID tribunal or
an UNCITRAL tribunal; and (ii) there is no complete review of arbitral awards by such

tribunals through national courts within the EU. This is the case even for ongoing

investment cases, since the ECJ’s judgments, unless specifically limited in time, apply ex

tune.

Further, concerning the fact that the EU is a Contracting Party to the ECT, the EC submits
that (i) the ECJ, in its findings in the ECJ Judgment, intended to carve out only those
international courts that are set up by agreements signed by the EU that respect the
autonomy of the EU and its legal order; and (ii) the Tribunal has been set up as a result of
bilateral commitments between Italy and Luxembourg, and not as a result of the EU’s

participation in the ECT.4%

(3) Interaction between the ECT and EU law

Regarding the interaction between the ECT and the EU Treaties, i.e., the TEU and the
TFEU, the EC offers two solutions: first, a harmonious interpretation of the ECT in
conformity with EU law, or second, in the event of a conflict, the primacy of EU law as lex

posterior.

With respect to the harmonious interpretation of the ECT, the EC, in addition to its
submission that EU law forms part of relevant rules of international law under
Article 31(3)(c) WCLT (see {| 337 above), also puts forth an interpretation on the basis of
other means of interpretation under Articles 31 and 32 VCLT. In this regard, the EC relies,
inter alia, on (i) the definition of “Contracting Party” under Article 1(2) ECT, which
includes an REIO such as the EU; (ii) the definition of an REIO in Article 1(3) ECT; and
(iii) other provisions relating specifically to an REIO, such as Article 36(7) ECT and
Article 1(10) ECT, the latter of which defines the term “Area” with respect to an REIO. On
this basis, the EC states that the ECT recognises that the relationships between Member
States to an REIO and the REIO are governed by the provisions of the agreement
establishing the REIO itself. Further, according to the EC, in light of these provisions of
the ECT, investments within the REIO are investments within the same Contracting Party,

to which the offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT does not apply. In this regard, the EC

also criticises the interpretation of Article 26 ECT offered by certain arbitral tribunals for

depriving certain provisions of the ECT of their full effect or importance.**

345. Moreover, the EC derives context to support its interpretation from the Statement made by
the European Communities under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT, specifically stating that “[t]he
Communities and the Member States will . . . determine among them who is the respondent
party to arbitration proceedings initiated by an Investor of another Contracting Party”
(emphasis added by the EC). The use of the term “another”, according to the EC, restricts
the offer to arbitrate in Article 26 ECT to investors from non-EU Member States.
Additionally, the context for interpretation of Article 26 ECT is also derived by the EC
from the fact that the EU and its Member States negotiated the ECT as one single block,

pursuant to the EU law principle of unity in the international representation of the EU.*°

346. The EC does not consider the absence of a “disconnection clause” in the ECT to affect its
interpretation of Article 26 ECT, since a “disconnection clause” is “superfluous” in respect
of intra-EU relations between Member States, even more so since the EU is already a
Contracting Party to the ECT. In this regard, the EC advocates of the “liability follows
competence” principle to allocate liability between the EU and its Member States, deriving
support from the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations and
the jurisprudence of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. It highlights that
since renewable energy falls within the EU’s exclusive competence, the EU is the one
responsible towards investors and not its Member States. In light of this demarcation of

responsibilities between the EU and its Member States, a disconnection clause or its
absence is not material for the interpretation of the ECT.*°°

347. The EC’s alternative proposal, with respect to the rules relating to conflict between treaties,
is that the conflict rule in Article 351(1) TFEU does not apply to multilateral treaties where
only the rights and obligations of EU Member States is at stake. Instead a “special conflict
tule”, i.e., the general principle of primacy of EU law, arrived at based on an a contrario
reading of Article 351 TFEU, applies with the result that the EU Treaties take absolute

precedence over Article 26 ECT.*°”

348. The EC also contends that the same result is achieved pursuant to Articles 30 (successive
treaties) and 41 (modification of multilateral treaties) VCLT, since either (i) Germany and
Sweden’s reaffirmation of Articles 4(3) and 19 TEU and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU after
their ratification of the ECT can be construed as an amendment for the purposes of Article
41 VCLT; or (ii) the TEU and TFEU constitute “later treaties” on the same subject matter
as the ECT, and the ECT applies only to the extent it is compatible with these later treaties.
Similarly, Article 16 ECT does not inhibit this conclusion, since it is only a rule of
“interpretation” and not one of conflict and, in any event is overruled by a later conflict

rule in Article 351 TFEU, together with the principle of primacy of EU law.*%

(4) Non-enforceability of Award rendered by the Tribunal

349. The EC qualifies the measures contested by Claimants as “state aid” in the sense of Article
107(1) TFEU, which has not been authorized by the EC. Given that the EC has the
exclusive authority to authorize such state aid, this Tribunal is not competent to conduct
this assessment, especially since a determination of the fair and equitable treatment breach
will require EU law principles of state aid to be looked into. Accordingly, as per the EC, if
this Tribunal was to grant compensation to Claimants, it would be authorizing state aid,
hence violating the distribution of competence set out in EU law, which may hinder the
enforcement of any award as a violation of EU law. However, in the event the Tribunal
does assume jurisdiction, the EC offers its availability to explore ways for safeguarding the

EU law on state aid in this case.4°

possible, follow the Parties’ order of submissions while laying out its determinations. In
the process, the Tribunal shall also address the EC’s observations on this matter, to the

extent relevant and appropriate.

At the outset, the Tribunal shall determine the disputed issues relating to the applicable law
to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction (1). Thereafter, based on its findings on the applicable law,
the Tribunal shall determine whether EU law limits or precludes this Tribunal’s

resolution of any conflicts between the different treaties in question, i.e., the ECT on the

one side and the EU Treaties on the other side (3).

(1) Applicable Law

The Parties have made extensive submissions concerning the applicable law to this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, specifically directed towards whether EU law falls within this
sphere of applicable law in these proceedings. In order to determine this foundational
question, the Tribunal shall (a) first, determine whether the applicable law regime in the
ECT, prescribed in Article 26(6) ECT applies to questions of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction;
(b) second, address the interaction between Article 26 ECT and the Swedish legal order, in
light of Stockholm, Sweden being the seat of this arbitration; and (c) lastly, based on the
determinations of the first two issues, determine the nature and applicability of EU law for

questions of jurisdiction.

a. Whether Article 26(6) ECT applies to Questions of Jurisdiction

The Parties are in dispute about whether the applicable law to questions of jurisdiction can
be derived from Article 26(6) ECT. To recall, Article 26(6) ECT provides that “[a] tribunal
established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this
Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.” (emphasis added)

Respondent’s position is that Article 26(6) ECT applies equally to the “issues in dispute”
pertaining to the merits of the case and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The EC is of the
same view. Claimants, however, submit that Article 26(6) ECT only refers to the
substantive rules governing the Tribunal’s analysis of Italy’s liability, and does not address
the applicable law to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which is governed solely by the

provisions of the ECT.
The Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’ submissions.

In order to appropriately understand the scope of Article 26(6) ECT, the phrase “issues in
dispute” is instrumental. Interpreting this phrase as per Article 31(1) VCLT, ie., “in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their

context”, it is relevant to consider Article 26(1) ECT as part of the context of Article 26(6)

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

ECT. Article 26(1) ECT delineates the types of “disputes” covered within Article 26 ECT

generally. It provides as follows:

Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting
Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which
concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if
possible, be settled amicably. (emphasis added)

 

It is evident from this provision that the only “disputes” that Article 26 ECT applies to are
those that concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the host State as prescribed in Part
III of the ECT. Part III of the ECT is titled “Investment Promotion and Protection”. Article
26 ECT itself is contained in Part V of the ECT titled “Dispute Settlement”. Thus, the
specific qualification of the term “disputes” in Article 26(1) ECT to cover only disputes
relating to investment promotion and protection (Part III of the ECT), and not disputes
relating to dispute settlement itself (Part V of the ECT), entails that Article 26(1) ECT
addresses only “disputes” relating to the substantive obligations of the host State
concerning investment promotion and protection. By implication, the phrase “issues in
dispute” in Article 26(6) ECT should also be understood as covering only those issues that

relate to alleged breaches of such substantive obligations of the host State.

Therefore, the applicable law framework provided in Article 26(6) ECT, i.e., “the Treaty
and applicable rules and principles of international law” is only relevant for the substantive
issues in dispute concerning Respondent’s liability under the ECT. This provision does not
prescribe the applicable law framework for questions relating to this Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.

b. Article 26 ECT and Swedish Law

In light of the Tribunal’s finding that Article 26(6) ECT does not apply to questions of this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Tribunal shall now examine which law(s) applies to such

questions.

The starting point for this examination is the dispute resolution provision in the ECT, ie.,
Article 26 ECT itself. Given that Article 26 ECT is a provision contained in an

international treaty, its interpretation and application should be in accordance with the

broad framework of the VCLT. This uncontroversial proposition finds endorsement in case

law, including a decision of the Svea Court of Appeal in Kazakhstan v. Stati.4!°

Article 26 ECT, inter alia, contains Respondent’s expression of its “unconditional consent”
to arbitrate investor-State disputes, and the terms and conditions for the exercise of such
consent (see Article 26(3) ECT). This consent to arbitrate materializes into an arbitration
agreement when the concerned investor(s) accepts this offer. In this regard, the investor(s)
has a choice of four regimes to submit its dispute: (i) arbitration under the ICSID
Convention; (ii) arbitration under the ICISD Additional Facility Rules; (iii) ad hoc
arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules; and (iv) arbitration administered by the SCC (see
Article 26(4) ECT).

In the instant case, Claimants’ acceptance of Respondent’s offer to arbitrate came in the
form of Claimants’ RfA dated 26 August 2016, whereby Claimants opted for the fourth
regime, i.e., arbitration administered by the SCC (see { 7 above). The SCC Board
determined Stockholm, Sweden to be the seat of this arbitration (see { 17 above). As a
result, Swedish law relating to arbitration may also be a relevant consideration when
examining this Tribunal’s jurisdiction as the law of the seat or /ex arbitri. Whether and to
what extent the law of the seat is relevant for a determination of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction

is a disputed issue between the Parties.

The Parties were questioned about this specific matter during the Hearing, specifically in
the context of the Decision on the Achmea Issue rendered by the tribunal in Vattenfall v.
Germany (“Vattenfall Decision”).*!! The Parties also made extensive submissions about

this matter in their post-hearing submissions.*!”

In general terms, the Parties disagree about the relevance of the Vattenfall Decision,
rendered in the context of the ICSID Convention regime, in the present case being
administered by the SCC with the seat of arbitration in Stockholm. On the one hand,

Respondent considers that “the whole reasoning behind the Vatte{n [fall award, that ICSID

would represent an autonomous legal order insulated from application of EU law, cannot
apply in a situation where exactly the reverse has to be stated”.*'* On the other hand,
Claimants submit that “the Tribunal should not hesitate to extend the reasoning of

Vattenfall to this SCC arbitration seated in Stockholm”.*!+

365. In particular, amongst other aspects, the Parties’ submissions have focussed on the finding
of the Vattenfall tribunal that “in cases where the investor opts for another forum, such as
an ad hoc UNCITRAL arbitration or arbitration under the SCC Rules, that tribunal’s
jurisdiction may be circumscribed by the local arbitration law of the place of
arbitration.”*!° This finding was rendered in the Vattenfall Decision, after the tribunal
found, while examining the relation between Article 26 ECT and the ICSID Convention,
that “the terms of the ICSID Convention do not add to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but

rather provide its ‘outer limits’”.*'®

366. Neither Claimants nor Respondent question the propriety of the Vattenfall Decision’s
above quoted finding that in investor-State arbitrations under the UNCITRAL regime or
the SCC regime, a tribunal’s jurisdiction may be circumscribed by the local arbitration law
of the seat of the arbitration (see { 365 above). Respondent quotes the above referenced
findings of the Vattenfall Decision (see { 365 above) and characterizes the Tribunal’s
questions during the Hearing about the relevance of the Vattenfall Decision as being
“extremely well posed”.*!’ Claimants also do not dispute the role played by Swedish law
on arbitration on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, i.e., of circumscribing or providing outer
limits to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. They only contend that there exists no such

circumscription that emanates from any principle in Swedish law.*!8

367. Whether or not there is any circumscription or limitation on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction that

emanates from Swedish law is a question the Tribunal will address subsequently (see

Section D(2) below). However, at this stage, the only relevant question for the Tribunal to
determine is whether Swedish law as the /ex arbitri is part of the applicable law framework
for questions relating to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and if so to what extent. The Tribunal
answers that question in the affirmative, with the qualification that the lex arbitri
circumscribes this Tribunal’s jurisdiction and does not add to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In
other words, the /ex arbitri would provide the “outer limits” to a tribunal’s jurisdiction, just

as the ICSID Convention does for arbitrations under the ICSID regime.

368. To this limited extent that the outer limits to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction stem from Swedish
law, as opposed to the ICSID Convention that plays this circumscribing role in the ICSID
regime, there does exist a distinction between the present case and an arbitration in the
ICSID regime.*!? Thus, to this extent, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ and
Respondent’s primary submissions that there is no distinction whatsoever between

arbitrations under the ICSID Convention regime and the SCC regime.

369. As mentioned above (see J 293 above), Respondent’s alternative contention is that there is
a distinction between arbitrations under the ICSID Convention regime and the present
arbitration. In support of this distinction, Respondent argues, inter alia, that (i) pursuant to
Section 33 of the Swedish Arbitration Act and Article V of the New York Convention, the

validity and enforceability of the Award of this Tribunal will be threatened if EU public

order, a constituent part of Swedish law, is not respected;*?° and (ii) consequently, the

reasoning of the Vattenfall Decision should not be extended to the present case, due to the
distinct legal settings of both the cases.4?! Claimants also respond to each of these
arguments, submitting, inter alia, that (i) the future validity and enforceability of the

Award of this Tribunal should not concern the Tribunal at this jurisdictional stage, and in

419 The Tribunal notes that the outer limits that stem from the ICSID Convention relate to the autonomous

understanding of what qualifies as an “investment”, whereas the outer limits that stem from the Swedish legal order
are of a different nature. This is explained in further detail in | 372 below. However, in both the ICSID and the SCC
regimes, the role played by these outer limits remains the same, ie., the circumscription of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.

any event, there will no threat to the validity or enforceability of the Award since investor-
State disputes are arbitrable under Swedish law;*”? and (ii) the reasoning of the Vattenfall
Decision should be extended to the present case, and there is no substantive distinction

between arbitrations under the ICSID Convention regime and the present arbitration.*??

At this stage, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to examine the
Parties’ dispute about whether the overall reasoning of the Vattenfall Decision should
apply to the present case. It suffices to state that the Tribunal is not bound by any prior case
law that has addressed jurisdictional objections arising out of EU law, be it under the

ICSID Convention regime or otherwise.

Similarly, the Tribunal also does not consider it appropriate or necessary to examine the
Parties’ disagreements about how Swedish courts or other enforcing courts may review the
Tribunal’s Award in future, and whether the Tribunal’s Award will be considered valid or
enforceable under Section 33 of the Swedish Arbitration Act or Article V of the New York
Convention. The Tribunal is mindful of its duty to render an enforceable Award. In the
present situation, the Tribunal does not foresee any hindrances to the validity or
enforceability of this Award. In any event, at this stage, the Tribunal is not in a place to
predict the future validity or enforceability of its Award before Swedish courts or other
enforcing courts. Currently, the Tribunal is only concerned with determining the applicable
law framework for questions over this Tribunal’s jurisdiction over this intra-EU investor-
State dispute. In other words, it is the validity and enforceability of the arbitration
agreement between the disputing parties that is in question at this stage and not the future

validity and enforceability of the Award.

Consequently, the Tribunal determines that the applicable law framework for questions of
jurisdiction includes (i) Article 26 ECT; (ii) to be interpreted and applied in accordance

with the VCLT; and (iii) in light of the circumscription or outer limits provided by Swedish

law, which applies as lex arbitri. These outer limits to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction can take
the form of (i) any restrictions to the arbitrability of the dispute emanating from Swedish
law, i.e., whether or not the dispute may be determined by arbitrators (see Section 49(2) of
the Swedish Arbitration Act and Article II(1) of the New York Convention**); and (ii) any
other restrictions that could render the arbitration agreement unenforceable, for being
invalid, inoperative or incapable of being performed (see Section 49(1) of the Swedish

Arbitration Act and Article II(3) of the New York Convention*”»).

c. The Nature and Applicability of EU Law

373. In light of the Tribunal’s delineation of the scope of the applicable law to jurisdictional
issues in the previous sections, the Tribunal shall next examine whether and where EU law

falls within this applicable law framework.

(i) Nature of EU Law

374. In this regard, at the outset, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to analyse the nature of

EU law, i.e., whether it qualifies as international law and/or constitutes a part of the

#4 Section 49 of the Swedish Arbitration Act: “Where foreign law is applicable to the arbitration agreement,

section 4 shall apply to issues which are covered by the agreement, except when: in accordance with the
applicable law, the agreement is invalid, inoperative, or incapable of being performed; or 2. in accordance with
Swedish law, the dispute may not be determined by arbitrators.”

 

Section 4 of the Swedish Arbitration Act: “A court may not, over an objection of a party, rule on an issue which,
pursuant to an arbitration agreement, shall be decided by arbitrators.

A party must invoke an arbitration agreement on the first occasion that a party pleads his case on the merits in the
court. The invocation of an arbitration agreement raised on a later occasion shall have no effect unless the party had
a legal excuse and invoked such as soon as the excuse ceased to exist. The invocation of an arbitration agreement
shall be considered notwithstanding that the party who invoked the agreement has allowed an issue which is covered
by the arbitrati to be i by the Debt Enfc Authority in a case concerning expedited
collection procedures ....”

 

Article II(1) of the New York C ion: “Each C ing State shall ize an in writing under
which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise
between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not, concerning a subject matter
capable of settlement by arbitration.”

 

#5 Article II(3) of the New York Convention: “The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a

matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request
of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void,
inoperative or incapable of being performed.”

domestic law of the EU Member States. Claimants have consistently argued that EU law is
distinct from “public international law”, since it constitutes a regional legal order (see J
316 above). Respondent’s position is that EU law is applicable as international law and as
the national law of the EU Member States (see {| 292 above). The EC is of the same view
(see J 337 above).

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ characterization of EU law as a regional legal
order distinct from public international law. Claimants themselves recognize, at another
point in their submissions, that “EU law is a collection of treaties — nothing more.”4?° To
the extent that EU law is comprised of international treaties between sovereign States such
as the EU Treaties, i.e., the TEU and the TFEU, it is indisputably a source of international
law. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the EC’s invocation of Article 38 of the
Statute of the International Court of Justice (see { 337 above), which enlists the sources of

international law, the primary amongst them being international conventions or treaties.

In addition, EU law also constitutes part of the domestic legal order of the EU Member
States. Due to its sui generis nature, EU law has been described by the Advocate General
in the Kadi case as a “municipal legal order of translation dimension.”*?’ This sui generis
nature of EU law was explained in the ECJ Judgment in the Slowakische Republik v
Achmea BV case in the following terms:
Also according to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy of EU law with
respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law is
justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in

particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that
law.

Given the nature and characteristics of EU law . . ., that law must be regarded
both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving
from an international agreement between the Member States.*?*

Investment arbitration case law has also endorsed the dual or multiple nature of EU law,
i.e., constituting international law, to the extent that it is sourced from treaties, and
constituting a part of the domestic legal order of the EU Member States. The following
findings of the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary clearly explain this “multiple nature of
EU law”:
(i) The Multiple Nature of EU Law: EU law is a sui generis legal order,
presenting different facets depending on the perspective from where it is

analysed. It can be analysed from the perspectives of the international
community, individual Member States and EU institutions.

Given those perspectives, EU law has a multiple nature: on the one hand, it is
an international legal regime; but on the other hand, once introduced in the
national legal orders of EU Member States, it becomes also part of these
national legal orders.*”?
In light of the above, the Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s submissions and the EC’s
observations that EU law has a dichotomous nature. To the extent that it is sourced from
international treaties, it constitutes part of international law. Simultaneously, it also

constitutes a part of the domestic legal order of EU Member States.

(ii) Applicability of EU Law
Having established the nature of EU law, the Tribunal shall now examine its applicability
to the questions of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT. As determined above
(see {| 372 above), the Tribunal considers the applicable law framework for such questions
to be constituted by (i) Article 26 ECT; (ii) the principles of the VCLT pertaining to the
interpretation of Article 26 ECT, which emanate from Articles 31 and 32 VCLT; and (iii)
Swedish law, which applies as /ex arbitri to provide the circumscription or outer limits to

this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Given the dichotomous nature of EU law (see {| 378 above), there are two possible
gateways for it to enter the Tribunal’s analysis of its jurisdiction. First, EU law may
potentially enter this jurisdictional analysis through Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, if it qualifies

as “relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties” (item

(ii) of the applicable law framework). Second, EU law may potentially become applicable
as a constituent part of the Swedish legal order, which operates to create outer limits to this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the ECT (item (iii) of the applicable law framework). The

Tribunal shall examine both these gateways in turn.
EU law as relevant rules of international law under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT

Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, quoted in J 289 above, requires that while interpreting a treaty
provision in accordance with its ordinary meaning in its context and in light of the treaty’s
object and purpose, together with the context shall be taken into account “[a]ny relevant

rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”.

The EC proposes that EU law should be considered as part of such relevant rules of
international law while interpreting the ECT “in a situation between two EU Member
States’4?° (see {337-339 above). In support of this, the EC relies on the process of
systemic coherence in interpretation of treaties, apparently evidenced in case law of the
ICJ,4! and on other investment arbitration case law that recognizes EU law as a
manifestation of international law.**” Further, the EC also states that the specific
requirements of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT are fulfilled, ie., (i) EU law qualifies as
“international law”; (ii) EU law is “directly applicable to the subject-matter of the case”,
which involves EU Member States; and (iii) EU law is binding on the disputing parties

before this Tribunal.47

Respondent supports the EC’s observations, albeit not specifically on this issue relating to
Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.** As per Claimants, since EU law does not qualify as public

international law, it falls beyond the realm of “relevant rules of international law applicable

in the relations between the parties” under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT (see { 316 above).
Further, Claimants also supplement their argument by stating that applying EU law under
Article 31(3)(c) VCLT in the manner that the EC proposes would result in the undesirable
consequence that “the same words in the same treaty hav[e] different meanings depending
on the independent legal obligations entered into by one state or another, depending on the

parties to a particular dispute”.**°

In order to examine if EU law enters the interpretative analysis through Article 31(3)(c)
VCLT, the Tribunal is required to examine whether (i) EU law qualifies as international
law; (ii) EU law is relevant and applicable in the relations between the parties; and (iii)

systemic coherence requires EU law to be considered while interpreting Article 26 ECT.

The Tribunal has already answered the first question in {| 384 above in the affirmative. EU
law, to the extent that it is sourced from the EU Treaties, does constitute international law

(see J 375 above).

With respect to the second and third questions in {| 384 above, the Tribunal is not
persuaded by the EC’s observations. The Tribunal does not consider the EU Treaties to be
relevant rules that are applicable in the relations between the parties, such that systemic
coherence requires taking them into account for a harmonious interpretation of Article 26

ECT. This is for three reasons.

First, as a general matter, it is important to remember that Article 31(3)(c) VCLT requires
that the relevant rules of international law be “taken into account, together with the
context” (emphasis added). The general rule for interpretation is laid down in Article 31(1)
VCLT, which requires an interpretation “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object

and purpose.”

The EC proposes that the interpretation of Article 26 ECT commence by taking into

account EU law under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, which it recognizes as an “element extrinsic

to the [ECT]’.**° Only subsequently does the EC support its interpretation of the ECT
based on Article 31(3)(c) VCLT with the “other means of interpretation”.*” The EC’s
proposal reverses the logical order of the interpretation process. The rules of international
law to be accounted for together with the context under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, while
essential, are not the logical starting point of the interpretation process. Instead, the starting
point of the interpretation process is the general rule in Article 31(1) WCLT, which
prioritizes the text of the treaty provision under interpretation over any other elements of
treaty interpretation. In other words, Article 31(3)(c) VCLT and the relevant rules of
international law applicable thereunder cannot rewrite the treaty being interpreted, or
substitute a plain reading of a treaty provision with other rules of international law,

external to the treaty being interpreted.

Second, the EC suggests that introducing EU law into the interpretative analysis of Article
26 ECT under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, when the ECT is being applied between two EU
Member States, results in a harmonious interpretation through a process of systemic
coherence. As mentioned in {| 382 above, the EC limits its proposed interpretation of
Article 26 ECT to “a situation between two EU Member States”. However, what the EC
proposes is in contradiction to the objective of harmonious interpretation or system
coherence between different bodies of international law. The ECT is a multilateral
convention, to which sovereign States other than the EU Member States are also parties.
Claimants rightly submit that allowing EU law into the interpretation process of the ECT
when the ECT is being applied between EU Member States would result in the same
provision in the ECT (in this case, Article 26 ECT) having different interpretations for
different Contracting Parties depending on the origins of the disputing parties in a

particular case.

Contrary to the EC’s proposal, the condition for applicability under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT
is not whether EU law is “directly applicable to the subject-matter of the case” or whether
a conflicting interpretation would lead to an EU Member State conflicting its own

“obligations at different levels of international law”.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

To make the interpretation of a multilateral convention dependent on a case-by-case
consideration of the factual subject matter or on the origins of the disputing parties does
not achieve the objective of affording a consistent and universal interpretation to a treaty
provision. If the interpretation of a treaty were to be made contingent on the factual
subject-matter of every case, Article 31(3)(c) VWCLT would have specifically permitted a
consideration of “subject matter of the case” when determining which rules of international
law are relevant and applicable. The VCLT aspires for the “universal recognition” of “the
principles of free consent and of good faith and the pacta sunt servanda rule”. This
aspiration of the universal recognition of these principles underlines the need for

coherence, and, in turn, for a single unified interpretation of each treaty provision.

In light of the above, while the objectives of harmonious interpretation and systemic
coherence proposed by the EC are well-intentioned, they are not achieved by rendering EU
law relevant and applicable to the interpretation of Article 26 ECT through Article 31(3)(c)
VCLT.

Third, on a related note, none of the cases mentioned in the EC’s observations support the
EC’s proposed understanding of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. The investment arbitration cases
relied upon by the EC do not support the proposition that EU law should be considered,
under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, together with the context of the ECT while interpreting
Article 26 thereof.*** Similarly, in its judgment in the Oil Platforms case, the ICJ invoked
Article 31(3)(c) VCLT to interpret a particular treaty provision in the 1955 Treaty of
Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights between the United States and Iran in
light of the “relevant rules of international law on the use of force . . . that is to say the
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and customary international law.”4*° To
take into account the such universal rules of international law on use of force under Article

31(3)(c) VCLT is different from taking into account the very specific provisions of the EU

Treaties that the EC proposes. The two situations are not comparable, and thus the ICJ’s
judgment in the Oil Platforms case also does not support the EC’s reliance on the

objectives of systemic coherence and harmonious interpretation.

In light of the above, the Tribunal does not consider EU law to be relevant or applicable to
the interpretation of Article 26 ECT, pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. In any event, in
order for any rule of international law to be applicable under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, it is
also imperative that such rule be a clearly determinable rule. The need for such clarity is
implicitly reflected in the primacy of the text of the treaty under interpretation, as per the
general rule in Article 31(1) VCLT. The Tribunal shall address this further, to the extent

relevant, in the context of the applicability of EU law as part of the Swedish legal order.

EU Law as a part of the Swedish legal order

As mentioned above (see {| 378-380 above), the second gateway for EU law to enter the
Tribunal’s analysis of questions of jurisdiction is through the Swedish legal order, which

operates to create outer limits to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction as the lex arbitri.

The Tribunal has already found that EU law has a dichotomous nature, i.e., it is a
manifestation of international law to the extent it is sourced from the EU Treaties, and is
simultaneously also a constituent part of the EU Member States’ domestic legal order (see
{| 378 above). Since Sweden is an EU Member State, EU law does form a part of the
Swedish legal order, and thus could potentially create outer limits to this Tribunal’s

jurisdiction as a part of the ex arbitri.

The role of the /ex arbitri as creating outer limits to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is discussed
in Section D(1)(b) above. As mentioned in {| 372 above, these outer limits can take the
form of (i) any restrictions to the arbitrability of the dispute emanating from Swedish law;
and (ii) any other restrictions that could render the arbitration agreement invalid,

inoperative or incapable of being performed.

The Tribunal considers that such restrictions to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction cannot be lightly
assumed. Any restriction to jurisdiction should emanate from a clearly determinable rule.

This is for the following two reasons.

First, under Swedish law, as Claimants rightly point out, the language of the dispute
resolution provision is crucial, and a departure from its express terms is usually not
permitted. This is true for commercial as well as investor-State cases.“° For instance, the
following findings of the Svea Court of Appeal in Case No. T-2675-14, while interpreting
Article 26 ECT as per Article 31 VCLT are reflective of the sanctity of the clear text of the
arbitration agreement, in particular one contained in the dispute resolution clause of a
treaty:
In order for an arbitral tribunal to be competent to try a dispute, a valid
arbitration agreement must be in place between the parties to the dispute. In the
present case, the question of whether there was an arbitration agreement
between the Investors and Kazakhstan is to be assessed on the basis of Art. 26

ECT, which the Investors invoked as basis for the arbitral tribunal’s
jurisdiction in their request for arbitration . . .

The wording of the treaty always constitutes the starting point for the

interpretation. If the wording is clear, it in principle also constitutes the end

point for the interpretation.
Second, given that Article 26 ECT contains, in explicit terms, the “unconditional consent”
of a State to arbitrate investor-State disputes (see { 361 above), any conditions or
restrictions to be imposed on such consent are required to be clear and explicit as well. It
cannot be doubted that when the creation of the arbitration agreement is unequivocal as a
matter of form, any substantive restrictions on its existence, be it legal restrictions on
arbitrability or any other restrictions on the enforceability of the arbitration agreement

should be clearly established in order to inhibit the effect of the arbitration agreement.

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that any outer limits that the Swedish legal order
may impose on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction require to be clearly determinable. Given that
EU law, due to its dichotomous nature, is a constituent part of Swedish law, at least to the
extent of the EU Treaties, it may also theoretically create such outer limits. In the next
Section, the Tribunal shall determine whether any such clear outer limits emerge from EU

law, as it stands currently, i.e., after the ECJ Judgment.

Before concluding this Section, the Tribunal considers it important to clarify the precise
scope of the Tribunal’s determinations that shall follow in light of the delineation of the
precise applicable law framework. Given that the Tribunal has found that the first gateway
for the entry of EU law into the applicable law framework is closed, EU law does not enter
the Tribunal’s applicable law framework through Article 31(3)(c) VCLT (see | 394 above).
Thus, the question to be resolved is no longer about the interpretation of Article 26 ECT
taking into account EU law as part of the relevant context for such interpretation. Instead,
the analysis that will follow in the forthcoming Section shall only relate to the application
of EU law to questions of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction as a constituent part of the Swedish
legal order, which comprises the /ex arbitri. Thus, the question, to which the Tribunal next

turns, is whether EU law provides any limitations to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

(2) Whether EU Law provides a Limitation to this Tribunal’s
Jurisdiction
The question of whether Swedish law, through EU law, creates any limitation to this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT shall be examined from two related
perspectives: (a) first, the Tribunal shall analyse whether any clearly discernible limitations
arise from the EU Treaties and/or the principle of autonomy of EU law relied upon by
Respondent; and (b) second, the Tribunal shall determine whether the ECJ Judgment and
the EU Member States’ January 2019 Declarations provide or confirm any such

limitations.

a. The EU Treaties and the Principle of Autonomy
Respondent invokes Articles 267 and 344 TFEU (quoted in {| 288 above) and the general
principle of autonomy of EU law to argue that EU law does not permit intra-EU investor-
State arbitration. Articles 267 and 344 TFEU are requoted below for ease of reference:

Article 267

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give
preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) _ the interpretation of the Treaties;

136

405.

406.

407.

442

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

(b) _ the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State,
that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is
necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling
thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal
of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under
national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a
Member State with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the
European Union shall act with the minimum of delay.

Article 344

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation

or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those

provided for therein.
In particular, as per Respondent, Article 267 TFEU, which provides for the preliminary
ruling mechanism before the ECJ, is essential for preserving the basic character of the EU
Treaties’ legal order, since it aims to ensure consistency in the understanding of EU law.
Since this Tribunal is not a “court or tribunal of a Member State” under Article 267 TFEU,
it cannot invoke this preliminary ruling mechanism.” In respect of Article 344 TFEU,
Respondent’s view is that disputes relating to the interpretation or application of EU law
cannot be submitted to any dispute resolution mechanism not provided for in the EU
Treaties itself. In this context, Respondent invokes the principle of mutual trust between
the EU Member States’ legal and judicial institutions and the principle of autonomy of EU
law (see {{[ 296 and 301 above).

The EC also invokes the need for preserving the autonomy of the EU legal order, along the

above lines (see Jf 339-340 above).

Claimants dispute the existence of any prohibition of intra-EU investor-State arbitration

emanating from the above treaty provisions or legal principles. In this connection,

Claimants primarily rely on unanimous case law from investor-State arbitral tribunals that

have rejected jurisdictional objections relating to EU law (see J 319 above).

The Tribunal shall examine the implications of the ECJ Judgment and the recent legal
developments thereafter separately in the next Section. In this Section, the Tribunal is only
concerned with whether the above quoted provisions of the TFEU together with the
principles of a mutual trust and autonomy of EU law serve to create clearly discernible
limits to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT. The Tribunal answers this

question in the negative. The Tribunal notes the following in this connection.

First, neither Article 267 TFEU nor Article 344 TFEU contains an explicit prohibition of
investor-State arbitration. None of the Parties nor the EC disputes that. Instead, these
provisions are concerned with the preliminary ruling mechanism for the ECJ and the
jurisdiction over disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the EU Treaties

themselves.

This mechanism and the jurisdictional limitation for disputes relating to the EU Treaties
cannot create any express or implied limitations to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction over an
investor-State dispute under Article 26 ECT. Articles 267 and 344 TFEU certainly do not
pertain to investor-State arbitration specifically. In fact, Respondent itself recognizes that
“Article 344 TFEU expresses a more general principle”.++? However, Respondent uses this
general principle, together with Article 267 TFEU, to implicitly invoke the principle of
autonomy of EU law, and thereby derives a prohibition of investor-State arbitrations under

EU law.

The Tribunal finds Respondent’s reading of these provisions to be overly expansive. For
instance, Respondent submits that the general principle in Article 344 TFEU pertains to
disputes concerning the interpretation or application of EU law overall, and not only the
EU Treaties.““* However, that is inconsistent with the language of Article 344 TFEU,
which clearly applies only to disputes between EU Member States relating to the

interpretation or application of the EU Treaties, and thus has no direct application in the

present case. In this regard, the Greentech v. Italy tribunal correctly found that an investor-
State arbitration under Article 26 ECT does not “concern the interpretation or application
of the EU treaties, but instead concerns rights and obligations under the ECT.’”*> In fact,
the ECJ in its earlier Opinion No. 1/2009, upon which Respondent relies,*#° had found that
Article 344 TFEU “merely prohibits Member States from submitting a dispute concerning
the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than
those provided for in the Treaties” and does not prohibit disputes involving private

persons.*47

Similarly, with respect to Article 267 TFEU, the Tribunal is mindful that the preliminary
ruling mechanism may be important to ensure a uniform understanding of the EU Treaties
and EU law in general, including the ECT, which forms part of EU law since the EU is a
party to it. However, the Tribunal notes that this mechanism is neither the only manner in
which a uniform understanding of EU law can be achieved, nor a mandatory procedure that
all courts and tribunals even within the EU legal order are required to adhere to. This is
evidenced by the fact that courts in the EU legal order have often rejected requests to refer
questions relating to the ECT for a preliminary ruling. As obiter dictum, the Tribunal notes
that this happened most recently in the Svea Court of Appeal’s rejection, in the Novenergia
II v. Spain case, to refer to the ECJ the question of “whether Article 26 of the ECT is
applicable between the [M]ember [S]tates of the European Union, and if that is the case,
whether Article 26 of the ECT is compatible with the European Union’s primary law”. In
this regard, the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary rightly noted under this provision that
“there is no automatic reference to or seizure by the ECJ, as soon as any question of EU

law arises in a dispute before an EU national court.”44*

Furthermore, the principle of autonomy of EU law has nothing to do with this Tribunal’s

jurisdiction over intra-EU investor-State arbitrations under the ECT. The principle of

autonomy is best explained by the ECJ Judgment itself, where the ECJ qualified this
autonomy as being “with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international
law”, and stated that this autonomy “is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU
and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very
nature of that law.’“#? The fact that EU law has a sui generis nature of being autonomous
with respect to domestic law and international law does not, in any manner, inhibit the

jurisdiction of investor-State arbitral tribunals.

414. Second, as mentioned in { 408 above and as rightly submitted by Claimants, it has been
unanimously accepted in investment arbitration case law that there is no conflict between
intra-EU investor-State arbitration under Article 26 ECT and the above discussed
provisions of the TFEU and the principles of autonomy and mutual trust in EU law. In
other words, EU law, until before the ECJ Judgment, was unanimously understood to not

create any limitations on arbitral tribunals’ jurisdiction.

415. In the words of the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary, there was “no legal rule or principle
of EU law that would prevent [it] from exercising its functions in this arbitration under
Article 26 ECT.”*° Along the same lines, the tribunals in RREEF v. Spain and more

recently in Novenergia II v. Spain noted that there is no “disharmony or conflict”! or no

resolution clauses, after examining the provisions of the TFEU and other principles of EU
law discussed above. All found that there were no limitations provided by EU law on intra-

EU investor-State arbitral tribunals’ jurisdiction.

416. The above conclusions were not inhibited by the fact that the EU is a party to the ECT. As

stated by the tribunal in Charanne v. Spain:

[T]he competence of the Arbitral Tribunal to decide on a claim filed by an
investor of an EU Member State against another EU Member State on the basis
of the alleged illegal nature of the actions carried out in the exercise of its
national sovereignty, is perfectly compatible with the participation of the EU as
a REIO in the ECT. And, as we shall see in subsequent sections of the present
award, there is no rule of EU law which prevents EU Member States to resolve
through arbitration their disputes with investors from other Member States
through arbitration. Nor is there any EU law rule that prevents an arbitral
tribunal to apply EU law to resolve such a dispute.**+

417. The tribunal in Blusun v. Italy summarized the consistent line of jurisprudence in investor-
State arbitration in the following terms:
Overall the effect of these decisions is a unanimous rejection of the intra-EU
objection to jurisdiction. The tribunal in each case has found that the relevant
BIT or the ECT was intended to bring about binding obligations between EU
Member States. The tribunals found no contradiction between the substantive
provisions of EU law and the substantive or dispute resolution provisions of the
BITs. No such system for investor-State arbitration exists in EU law, and it
would be incorrect to characterise such disputes as inter-State disputes such
that Article 267 of the TFEU could be said to preclude jurisdiction.4°°
418. This Tribunal finds no reason to depart from this consistent line of jurisprudence. The bare
provisions of the EU Treaties in consideration, specifically Articles 267 and 344 TFEU,
and the ensuing principles of autonomy and mutual trust, do not create any limitations to

this Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT.

419. Next, the Tribunal shall examine whether this conclusion is affected or altered by the ECJ

Judgment of 6 March 2018 and the legal developments that followed thereafter.

b. The ECJ Judgment, the Declarations and other Issues

420. On 6 March 2018, the ECJ Judgment was rendered in Case C-284/16, Slowakische
Republik v Achmea BV. The Parties’ submissions thereafter have focussed on the
implications of the ECJ Judgment on this jurisdictional objection relating to EU law.
Before considering those submissions, the Tribunal recalls below the key findings of the
ECJ Judgment that are disputed between the Parties. The conclusion reached by the ECJ

Judgment was as follows:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8
of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments
between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative
Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in
the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose
jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.*°° (emphasis added)

421. Prior to reaching this conclusion, the ECJ also, inter alia, stated the following:

It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an_ international
agreement providing for the establishment _of a court responsible for the
interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on_the
institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with
EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its
capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to
submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by such
agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions,
provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected . . .

In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within
the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may
relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility
of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system
of the EU is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU
but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not
only the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but also the
preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties,
ensured by the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU,

and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation . . . .4°7

(emphasis added)
The Parties have not debated the propriety of the reasoning behind the ECJ Judgment.
Accordingly, the Tribunal, in its determinations below, also shall not examine whether the
ECJ Judgment’s interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 TFEU was appropriate and properly
motivated. Instead, the central dispute between the Parties concerns the scope and
implications of the ultimate conclusion of the ECJ Judgment, i.e., whether the above
conclusion (quoted in {| 420 above) reached in the context of Article 8 of the Slovak-Dutch
BIT, also extends to the ECT. In other words, as per the emphasised part in the above-
quoted conclusion of the ECJ Judgment, is Article 26 ECT also “preclude[ed]” as a result
of the ECJ Judgment’s interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 TFEU for being a provision
“such as” Article 8 of the Slovak-Dutch BIT?

In this regard, Respondent is of the view that the ECJ Judgment has confirmed the
importance of the autonomy of the EU legal order, which derives from Articles 267 and
344 TFEU. Respondent argues that due to the generic and expansive language used in the
ECJ Judgment, its conclusion extends to the ECT when it is being applied for bilateral
intra-EU obligations, regardless of the fact that the ECT is a multilateral treaty or that the
EU is a party to the ECT. In this connection, Respondent also relies on the January 2019
Declarations by the EU Member States in support of its submission that the principles
established in the ECJ Judgment were not specifically linked to the Slovak-Dutch BIT.
Respondent considers all prior investment arbitration case law rejecting the EU law related
jurisdictional objection to now be irrelevant, and criticizes all subsequent decisions and

awards for not recognizing the breadth of the ECJ Judgment (see {{] 294-300 above).
The EC’s views align with that of Respondent (see { 340-342 above).

Claimants submit that the reasoning of each of the investor-State tribunals that rejected the
EU law relating jurisdictional objection continues to hold value even after the ECJ
Judgment. Further, they rely on the more recent decisions by tribunals that have also

upheld jurisdiction even in the face of the ECJ Judgment. In any event, Claimants

distinguish the ECJ Judgment from the present case on the ground that the ECJ Judgment
itself restricted its conclusion only to BITs concluded “between” EU Member States, and
did not address, much less condemn, multilateral conventions such as the ECT. Further,
Claimants highlight that the ECJ Judgment was rendered in the context of a different
governing law provision, i.e., Article 8(6) of the Slovak-Dutch BIT, than what Article
26(6) ECT provides (see JJ 325-331 above).

Before examining the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal considers it important to recall its
findings above to establish the appropriate context for the determinations that follows. The
Tribunal has found that the only manner in which EU law is applicable to questions of this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction is as a constituent part of the Swedish legal order, which constitutes
the lex arbitri. Accordingly, EU law can only apply to the extent and in a manner that it
provides for any outer limits to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Such outer limits, if any, are

required to be contained in clearly determinable rules (see {J 395-402 above).

In light of this context, and having reviewed the ECJ Judgment and the Parties’
submissions in this regard, the Tribunal finds that the ECJ Judgment does not provide any
clearly determinable outer limits to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT. This

is for the following three reasons.

First, the Tribunal finds that the manner in which the ECJ Judgment’s conclusion is
worded makes it unclear whether the ECJ intended for the same to apply to multilateral
conventions such as the ECT. In its conclusion, quoted in {| 420 above, the ECJ Judgment
found that its interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 TFEU precludes “a provision in an
international_agreement_concluded_ between Member States, such as Article 8 [of the
Slovak-Dutch BIT]”. (emphasis added) The emphasised part in the conclusion already
appears to indicate that the conclusion was intended only for international agreements that
were concluded between the EU Member States, i.e., agreements to which only EU

Member States are parties.*°* This would usually include bilateral agreements between EU

Environment (SCA) SICAR, and NovEnergia II Italian Portfolio SA v. Italy, SCC Arbitration V (2015/095), Award,

Member States “such as” the Slovak-Dutch BIT. It is unclear whether multilateral
conventions, to which non-EU Member States are also parties, are also covered within the

ambit of this conclusion. The ECT is such a multilateral convention.

. This lack of clarity is deepened in light of the immediately preceding findings of the ECJ,
emphasised in the extract quoted in { 421 above. Herein, the ECJ concluded that
international agreements “providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the
interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions,
including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law”, provided that
such international agreements are “concluded . . . by the EU”. The EU is a party to the
ECT and is recognized as a REIO under Articles 1(2) and 1(3) ECT. In this connection, the
Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s and the EC’s emphasis on the division of
competences between the EU and its Member States under EU law, and the assertion that
EU’s position as a REIO under the ECT only serves to confirm such division of
competences. This division of competences in EU law or the fact that the ECT may be a
so-called “mixed agreement” based on the EU’s and its Member States’ respective external
competences,**? does not add any clarity to the question of whether the ECJ Judgment was

intended to apply to intra-EU arbitrations under the ECT.

. Second, the Tribunal considers it important that the AG Opinion rendered, pursuant to
Article 252 TFEU, by Advocate General Wathelet on 19 September 2017 prior to the ECJ
Judgment had specifically mentioned the ECT.* Despite being presented with an AG
Opinion that discussed the ECT and sought to distinguish its dispute resolution mechanism

from those in BITs, the ECJ was silent about the ECT in the Judgment.

. It is notable that the ECJ Judgment discussed the binding value of the AG Opinion, finding
that “[t]he Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s conclusion or by the
reasoning which led to that conclusion.”“*! In the present case, Respondent also challenges

the binding value and the propriety of the AG Opinion (see {| 299-300 above). However,

the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to examine the propriety the AG
Opinion. Further, the Tribunal is mindful of the lack of binding value of the AG Opinion.
Notwithstanding these considerations, the only point that the Tribunal considers important
for the purposes of its present determinations is that the ECJ had the opportunity to render
more expansive findings that would explicitly cover multilateral conventions such as the

ECT, but did not do so.

In light of this, the Tribunal considers that the ECJ Judgment’s conspicuous silence on the
ECT clouds the question of whether its conclusions extend to the ECT with greater lack of
clarity. To this extent, the Tribunal is in agreement with the following findings of the
tribunal in Masdar v. Spain:
Had the CJEU seen it necessary to address the distinction drawn by the
Advocate General between the ISDS provisions of the ECT and the investment
protection mechanisms to be found in bilateral investment treaties made
between Member States within the ambit of its ruling, it had the opportunity to
do so. In fact, the Tribunal notes that the CJEU did not address this part of the
Advocate General’s Opinion, much less depart from, or reject, it. The Achmea
Judgment is simply silent on the subject of the ECT.4
Third, the Tribunal finds that this lack of clarity about the scope of the ECJ Judgment is
further compounded by the January 2019 Declarations. As per Respondent, the first of the
January 2019 Declarations, signed on 15 January 2019 by 22 EU Member States including
Italy, is binding and “conclusively determine{s] the issue of jurisdiction” under the ECT.4%
The second of these Declarations, signed on 16 January 2019 by 5 EU Member States
including Sweden, does not differ from the 15 January 2019 Declaration, but only refrains
from making a “binding declaration as for the ECT as yet”.“* The third of these
Declarations, signed only by Hungary, is considered by Respondent to be identical to the
second Declaration.*°> Respondent’s position is that these January 2019 Declarations are

not intended only to inform arbitral tribunals about the EU Member States’ position but

intended to be binding interpretations of the ECT in light of the ECJ Judgment , which

“once [and] for all settles the issue”.*°°

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s characterization of the January 2019

Declarations for two reasons.

Firstly, although the Tribunal is not at a juncture where it is interpreting the ECT in light of
the ECJ Judgment but is only focussed on determining whether the ECJ Judgment applies
to the present case (see { 402 above), the Tribunal nonetheless notes that the January 2019
Declarations cannot operate as binding interpretations of the ECT. While there is no doubt
that such Declarations may be issued and are consistent with the ECT, they do not replace
the process of interpreting a treaty provision that has to be conducted in accordance with
the principles in Articles 31 and 32 VCLT. If and to the extent the January 2019
Declarations fall within any of the tenets of interpretation under Articles 31 or 32 VCLT,
they may be taken into account in the interpretative process. Indeed, the January 2019
Declarations themselves do not state that they provide interpretations that are binding on
arbitral tribunals, but instead clarify their scope as being intended to “inform investment

arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences of the Achmea judgment” 4°

Secondly, and in any event, the Tribunal finds that the contents of these January 2019
Declarations do not add clarity in respect of the question of whether the ECJ Judgment
extends to the ECT. The primary reason for this continuing lack of clarity is the
incongruity between the 15 and 16 January 2019 Declarations. While the 15 January 2019
Declaration states that in light of the ECJ Judgment, Article 26 ECT “would be
incompatible with the [EU] Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied”,** the 16
January 2019 Declaration signed by 5 Member States including Sweden, specifically
refrains from taking any position on whether the ECJ Judgment extends to the ECT. In the

following passage, it appears to acknowledge that the ECJ Judgment only related to BITs

and was silent on the ECT:

The Achmea case concerns the interpretation of EU law in relation to an
investor-state arbitration clause in a bilateral investment treaty between
Member States. The Member States note that the Achmea judgment is silent on
the investor-state arbitration clause in the Energy Charter Treaty. A number of
international arbitration tribunals post the Achmea judgment have concluded
that the Energy Charter Treaty contains an investor-State arbitration clause
applicable between EU Member States. This interpretation is currently
contested before a national court ina Member State. Against this background.
the Member States underline the importance of allowing for due process and
consider that it would be inappropriate, in the absence of a specific judgment
on this matter, to express views as regards the compatibility with Union law of
the intra EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.*°? (emphasis added)

437. Further, both the January 2019 Declarations specifically refer to the pending annulment
proceedings in the Novenergia II v. Spain case before the Svea Court of Appeal concerning
the interpretation of Article 26 ECT.*” While these annulment proceedings are yet to be
concluded, the Tribunal notes, as obiter dictum, that in the interim period, in April 2019,
the Svea Court of Appeal refused Spain’s request to refer the following question for a
preliminary ruling of the ECJ: “whether Article 26 of the ECT is applicable between the
[M]ember [S]tates of the European Union, and if that is the case, whether Article 26 of the
ECT is compatible with the European Union’s primary law” (see § 412 above). In light of
this recent development, Respondent’s submission that “it is expected that the question

[will] be referred to the CJEU soon, and these 5 Member States will be allowed to sign the

471

with uncertainty at this stage.

stronger language to state that “the Achmea judgment concerns only the intra-EU bilateral investment treaties . . .
and it does not concern any pending or prospective arbitration proceedings initiated under the ECT.”

Fourth, in addition to the diverging January 2019 Declarations, the fact that EU Member
States are themselves requesting for the question of the relationship between Article 26
ECT and EU law, particularly after the ECJ Judgment, to be referred to the ECJ is
indicative of the prevailing lack of clarity on this question. In fact, during the Hearing,
upon being questioned, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had also requested the
Italian Consiglio di Stato for a referral to the ECJ of question(s) relating to the
interpretation of the ECT:
PROF. GIARDINA: Why don’t you think it would be preferable to obtain a
specific rule from the European Court on the ECT, for instance, or another kind
of arbitration? Because it is reasonable also to think of this way of solving the

problem. Now we have to decide, of course, so we cannot wait for another
decision by the European Court interpreting the Energy Charter Treaty.

But it’s my question: why do you ask us to make this difficult exercise to
interpret the Achmea decision?

MR. GIORDANO: We actually raised a preliminary ruling under Articles 267
and 344 in a specific issue concerning energy as well, so under the ECT as
well. So we are actually waiting for a decision in that sense from the Consiglio
di Stato, which is of course the main judge in the administrative system. Being
a final and ultimate jurisdiction of the administrative Italian system, it is of
course obliged to raise the preliminary ruling before the European Court of
Justice. So we did it in one case.‘””

The above response by Respondent upon being questioned about why this Tribunal, and
not the ECJ itself, should clarify whether the ECJ Judgment extends to the ECT implicitly
indicates that even Respondent believes that there is currently a lack of clarity on the
question of the scope of the ECJ Judgment vis-a-vis the ECT, and that such lack of clarity

should be explicitly resolved by the ECJ.

While Respondent has since not informed the Tribunal of the status of its request for
referral before the Italian Consiglio di Stato, for the purposes of the current proceedings,
Respondent’s implicit admission of a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between
Article 26 ECT and EU law further persuades the Tribunal to find that there are currently

no clearly discernible limitations to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction emanating from EU law.

The Tribunal is therefore convinced by Claimants’ characterization of the question of the
applicability of the ECJ Judgment to the ECT as currently being “theoretical and
speculative”.*”> This theoretical and speculative question is not for this Tribunal to
conclusively resolve. The ECJ Judgment could have or any subsequent ruling by the ECJ
may in future resolve this question conclusively. For the purposes of this Tribunal’s current
jurisdictional analysis, it suffices to state, at this stage, that absent any clearly discernible
limitations to its jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT, EU law does not inhibit this Tribunal

from exercising jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims.

This lack of clearly discernible limitations is rendered even more conspicuous by a recent
court decision in the Swedish legal order, whereby intra-EU investor-State disputes were
recognized as being arbitrable. In a decision of the Svea Court of Appeal in PL Holdings v.

474 the Court refused to annul an

Poland from February 2019, referred to by Claimants,
award rendered under the BIT between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union and
Poland on jurisdictional grounds relating to EU law. Specifically, the Svea Court of Appeal
found that intra-EU investor-State disputes were not per se non-arbitrable, and that an
award rendered under the intra-EU investor-State arbitration would not violate Swedish
ordre public.*” Thus, the Court refused to annul the award on these grounds under Section

33 of the Swedish Arbitration Act, although it did partially annul the award on other

unrelated grounds.

On a related note, the Tribunal also agrees with the distinction Claimants draw between an
earlier judgment of the Nacka District Court in Stockholm in the Micula v. Romania case
of January 2019 and the present case. Respondent relies on this judgment as an example of
a case where a Swedish court refused to enforce an ICSID award in an intra-EU BIT
case.*”° However, as Claimants rightly point out, the Micula v. Romania case pertained to
the enforceability of an award, the payment of which the EC had declared to be

incompatible State aid.*” In the instant case, none of the payments or amounts claimed by
Claimants have been declared as impermissible State aid, nor does Respondent’s

jurisdictional objection under EU law raise State aid issues.

The only relevant issue for this Tribunal’s jurisdiction is whether the Swedish legal order,
and through it EU law, creates any clearly discernible limitations to this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT. The Tribunal has not found any such clearly discernible
limitations arising from Swedish and/or EU law. Thus, absent any clear indication about
whether the ECJ Judgment’s interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 TFEU extends to the

ECT, the present case falls within the outer limits of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

(3) Interpretation of Article 26 ECT and Conflict of Treaties

With respect to Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to EU law, the only issues
left for the Tribunal to determine stem from the Parties’ expansive submissions concerning
(a) the interpretation of Article 26 ECT independent of EU law entering this process of
interpretation, and (b) the alleged conflict between the ECT and the EU Treaties as two
regimes of international law, and how this conflict should be resolved using international
law rules such as Articles 30 and 41 VCLT, Article 351 TFEU and/or Article 16 ECT. The

Tribunal shall briefly examine the Parties’ submissions on these topics below.

a. Interpretation of Article 26 ECT

To recall, the Tribunal has already found that on an application of EU law as it exists
currently, there appear to be no clearly discernible limitations on this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT (see { 444 above). However, this still leaves open the
question of interpreting Article 26 ECT in its context and in light of the ECT’s object and
purpose, and whether such interpretation of the ECT excludes intra-EU investor-State
arbitration from the purview of Article 26 ECT. This interpretation will, of course, not take
into account EU law under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, in light of the Tribunal’s earlier finding
that EU law does not qualify as relevant or applicable under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT (see {
394 above).

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Under Article 31 VCLT (quoted in {| 289 above), the primary indication of the intention of
the Parties to a treaty is the text of the treaty provision being interpreted. That treaty
provision is Article 26 ECT (quoted in {| 287 above). In particular, the question in this
interpretation exercise is whether the term “Contracting Party” in the phrase “[d]isputes
between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party” in Article 26(1)
ECT can be read as excluding EU Member States in so far as intra-EU investor-State

arbitrations are concerned.

Text of Article 26 ECT: The Tribunal finds the text of Article 26 ECT to be clear and
unambiguous. It contains no explicit indication of any exclusion of EU Member States
from the scope of the term “Contracting Party” in Article 26 ECT. Further, the provision
does not expressly recognize any distinction between intra-EU and extra-EU disputes

whatsoever. Neither Respondents nor the EC contests these uncontroversial propositions.

Context: As part of the context of Article 26 ECT, Respondent (see {{[ 304-308 above) and
the EC (see J] 344-345 above) rely on many provisions of the ECT to propose that EU
Member States are excluded from the term “Contracting Party” in Article 26 ECT. Each of

these provisions are quoted in {| 287 above. These include:

(i) The EU’s position as a REIO under Article 1(3) ECT, and the fact that as such, the
EU is a “Contracting Party” of the ECT under Article 1(2) ECT and has its own
demarcated definition of “Area” under Article 1(10) ECT.

(ii) Article 25 ECT, which permits more preferential treatment between the Parties to
EIAs (Economic Integration Agreements), and the Decision, included in Annex 2 to
the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, with respect to Articles
24(4)(a) and 25 ECT, and the EU’s and EU Member States’ Declaration under
Article 25 ECT.4”

(iii) Article 16 ECT, which as per Respondent prohibits derogation from any more
favourable provision in EU law, including its access to justice mechanism, for the

benefit of an investor from an EU Member State.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

(iv) The Statement made by the European Communities under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT,

which as per the EC restricts the offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT only to
investors from non-EU Member States, since the Statement uses the term “another”
the following phrase: “[t]he Communities and the Member States will . . . determine
among them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings initiated by an

Investor of another Contracting Party.” (emphasis added by the EC)

450. The Tribunal considers that none of the above contextual matters warrants that the term

“Contracting Party” in the clear text of Article 26 ECT should be interpreted as excluding a

reference to EU Member States, and thereby excluding intra-EU arbitrations. In this regard,

the Tribunal notes the following:

@)

(ii)

479

The EU’s position as a REIO under Article 1(3) ECT does not indicate that Article
26 ECT is not applicable between EU Member States. The fact that Article 1(3) ECT
recognizes the transfer of “competence over certain matters” by the EU Member
States to the EU also does not reflect that the provisions of the ECT become
inapplicable between the Member States. Similarly, the two definitions of the term
“Area” in Article 1(10) ECT are not mutually exclusive, and the reference to “the
agreement establishing the [REIO]” appears to only be relevant for the geographical
demarcation of the “Area” in question. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants’
contention that these provisions, taken together with Article 1(2) ECT, only indicate
that the ECT recognizes that some Member States are also members of REIOs, while
ensuring that both the REIO and the Member States maintain their independent
positions as Contracting Parties to the ECT (see {| 320 above). This is also in line

with consistent jurisprudence of investor-State tribunals.*””

The same can be said for Respondent’s reliance on Article 25 ECT, and the
corresponding Decision with respect to Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 ECT and the EU’s
and EU Member States’ Declaration under Article 25 ECT. Article 25 ECT, the

Decision and the Declaration also only recognize that a Contracting Party to the ECT

can simultaneously be party to an EIA. However, this does not indicate that ECT and

its dispute resolution mechanism is inapplicable between EU Member States.

Article 16 ECT, although relied upon extensively by Respondent, in reality runs
counter to Respondent’s proposal. In essence, Article 16 ECT provides that between
the ECT and any other international agreement between two or more ECT
Contracting Parties on the same subject matter as Parts III or V of the ECT, the
“more favourable” provisions shall prevail. Assuming that the ECT and the EU
Treaties pertain to the same subject matter, the Tribunal considers that, to the extent
of the dispute resolution mechanism, the ECT provides for a more favourable regime
since it envisages multiple options for dispute resolution, including investor-State
arbitration, which the EU Treaties do not specifically provide for. Thus, in this regard
too, the Tribunal finds Claimants’ position convincing (see § 319 above).
Respondent’s submission that Article 26 ECT is not applicable between EU Member
States as a result of Article 16 ECT fails.

Only the EC makes observations with respect to the Statement made by the European
Communities under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) ECT. The only passage that the EC relies
upon is the following:
The Communities and the Member States will, if necessary, determine
among them who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings
initiated by an Investor of another Contracting Party. In such case, upon
the request of the Investor, the Communities and the Member States
concerned will make such determination within a period of 30 days.
(emphasis added)
According to the EC, the use of the term “another” before Contracting Party
excludes disputes brought by EU investors against an EU Member State from
the purview of the ECT. This proposition does not follow from the language of
the above Statement. If the intention was to exclude intra-EU disputes from the
purview of Article 26 ECT, that could and should have been mentioned in the
ECT itself. While the above Statement may hold interpretative significance
under Article 31(2)(b) VCLT, it cannot be used to override the clear text of

Article 26 ECT. Further, upon reading the Statement in context, it also appears

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

to only recognize a demarcation of competences between the EU and the
Member States, but not to completely exclude the application of ECT

provisions between EU Member States.

Disconnection Clause: Another contextual matter discussed by the Parties and the EC is
the absence of a disconnection clause in the ECT. Whereas Respondent and the EC
consider that the inclusion of such a disconnection clause would have been superfluous
(see J§ 298 and 346 above), Claimants emphasize this absence, which they deem
conspicuous in light of the EC’s prior treaty practice and the ECT’s travaux préparatoires

(see { 319 above).

The Tribunal finds Claimants’ argument on the absence of a disconnection clause
convincing. The consequence that Respondent and the EC attempt to derive from a strained
contextual interpretation of the ECT would have been convenient to achieve had a
disconnection clause existed therein. A disconnection clause would have achieved the
purpose of limiting the application of the ECT, which is a mixed agreement, such that it
was only applicable vis-a-vis third parties and not between EU Member States. Thus, in
essence, Respondent and the EC attempt to implicitly read into the ECT a disconnection
clause when none exists. It is unanimously accepted in investment arbitration case law that

this cannot be done.*8?

What makes the absence of a disconnection clause more telling is the fact that during the
negotiations of the ECT, the European Communities had in 1993 proposed the inclusion of
a disconnection clause.**! While this proposal did not ultimately materialize, it does reflect
that at that time a disconnection clause was not considered to be superfluous as the EU and

Respondent submit currently. This is not surprising considering that until the ECT’s entry

into force, disconnection clauses were common practice in international agreements

entered into by the EU, as Claimants rightly point out.**?

454. In light of the above, the Tribunal does not find any contextual support for excluding EU
Member States from the term “Contracting Party” in Article 26 ECT or for excluding intra-

EU investor-State disputes from the purview of Article 26 ECT.

455. Object and Purpose of the ECT and Travaux Préparatoires: The Tribunal also finds no
indication in the ECT’s object and purpose that would justify abandoning the clear text of
Article 26 ECT. Likewise, there is no such indication in the travaux préparatoires
submitted by Respondent, which the Tribunal shall address only for the sake of

completeness.

456. The EC suggests that the ECT was always intended to create an international framework of
cooperation in the energy sector between the EU and its Member States on the one side
participating as one consolidated block, and Russia, the CIS and the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe, on the other side.**? Respondent also relies on a document from the

travaux préparatoires to make arguments to the same end.**4

457. This purported object and purpose of the ECT does not come across from within the ECT,
nor from the solitary and unrelated travaux document submitted by Respondent. Instead,
Article 2 ECT stipulates a liberally worded object and purpose of the ECT, when it states
that “[t]his Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation
in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the
objectives and principles of the Charter.” The Charter also does not at any point
demonstrate a demarcation of this object and purpose between the EU Member States and

the non-EU Member States.

Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the object and purpose of the ECT or its travaux
préparatoires do not warrant a counter-textual conclusion that Article 26 ECT does not

apply between EU Member States for intra-EU investor-State disputes.

b. Conflict of Treaties

The Parties have made extensive submissions on how a conflict, if any, between the ECT
and the EU Treaties, specifically Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, should be resolved. In this
regard, their submissions deal with the application of Articles 30 and 41 VCLT, Article
351 TFEU and/or Article 16 ECT (see for Respondent’s submissions {| 309-313 above;
for Claimants’ submissions ff] 323-324 above; and for the EC’s observations §§ 347-348

above).

In light of the Tribunal’s earlier findings, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or

necessary to examine these submissions. This is for two reasons.

First, the Tribunal has concluded above (see { 401 above) that the only manner through
which EU law, including the EU Treaties, enters this Tribunal’s applicable law framework
is through the application of Swedish domestic law as lex arbitri. Thus, there is no possible
conflict between two sources of international law, i.e., the ECT and EU Treaties, to be
resolved in this case. Instead, the only question with respect to the interaction between the
ECT and EU law, which the Tribunal has already answered, is whether EU law, as a
constituent part of Swedish law, creates any outer limits to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. This

question has been answered in the negative (see | 444 above).

Second, and in any event, the Tribunal’s finding that EU law does not create any
limitations or restrictions on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT is also
dispositive of the question as to whether there is any conflict between Article 26 ECT and
Articles 267 and 344 TFEU. The latter question is also, by implication, answered in the
negative. The Tribunal has already found that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU have a different
sphere of application than Article 26 ECT, and do not expressly address or prohibit intra-
EU investor-State arbitration (see {J 409-413 above). Accordingly, there is no conflict to

be resolved by the application of any international law rules relating to conflict of treaties.

(4) Conclusion on the Jurisdiction Issue relating to EU Law

The Tribunal has found in the above Sections that (i) the only manner through which EU
law enters this Tribunal’s applicable law framework for questions of jurisdiction is through
the application of Swedish domestic law as lex arbitri, and not as a manifestation of
international law (see {| 401 above); (ii) Swedish and/or EU law does not create any clearly
discernible outer limits to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT, even after the
ECJ Judgment (see { 444 above); and (iii) an interpretation of Article 26 ECT, in
accordance with Articles 31 and 32 VCLT, does not lead to the conclusion that intra-EU
investor-State disputes were excluded from the scope of Article 26 ECT (see Jf 454 and
458 above).

In light of these reasons, Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to EU law and the

ECJ Judgment is rejected.

OTHER ISSUES OF JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

In addition to the jurisdictional objection relating to EU law, Respondent raises three
separate objections relating to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and, alternatively, the

admissibility of Claimants’ claims. These are as follows:

(i) Some of the measures taken by Italy that are at stake in these proceedings are
“taxation measures” under Article 21 ECT, and thereby excluded from the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal;

(ii) Respondent’s consent to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT is excepted by the exclusive
jurisdiction clause in favour of the Court of Rome in the GSE contracts entered into

with respect to Claimants’ photovoltaic plants; and

(iii) The requirement of a prior request for amicable solution under Article 26(1) ECT has

not been fulfilled with respect to some of Claimants’ claims.

In the forthcoming Sections, the Tribunal shall examine each of these jurisdictional and

admissibility objections in turn.

B. RELEVANT TREATY PROVISIONS

467. Apart from Article 26 ECT (quoted in {| 287 above), Article 21 ECT is relevant for the
Tribunal’s analysis of the other issues of jurisdiction and admissibility. It is reproduced

below to the extent relevant:
Article 21: Taxation

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall
create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of
the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this
Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to
the extent of the inconsistency.

(7) For the purposes of this Article:
(a) The term “Taxation Measure” includes:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a
local authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the
avoidance of double taxation or of any other international
agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is
bound.

(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes
imposed on total income, on total capital or on elements of income
or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of
property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially
similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid
by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.

(c) A “Competent Tax Authority” means the competent authority
pursuant to a double taxation agreement in force between the
Contracting Parties or, when no such agreement is in force, the
minister or ministry responsible for taxes or their authorized
representatives.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms “tax provisions” and “taxes”
do not include customs duties

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

(1) Respondent’s Position
a. Taxation Measures excluded from the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction

According to Respondent, a number of measures contested by Claimants in these
proceedings qualify as “taxation measures”, which term is defined in an open-ended
manner in Article 21(7) ECT. For these measures, Claimants claim a breach of Article
10(1) ECT, which is not mentioned in the exceptions to the rule provided in Article 21
ECT.*** As a result of this, Claimants’ claims in respect of these taxation measures are

beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as per Respondent.

Respondent submits that as per the definition of “taxation measure” in Article 21(7) ECT,
the two qualifying features for such measures are that (i) they must be sourced either in
domestic legislation or in international treaties; and (ii) they must generally relate to fiscal

measures.**°

With respect to what qualifies as a fiscal measure and what does not, Respondent contends
that the ECT defers to domestic laws of Contracting Parties. Accordingly, Respondent
supports its submission by relying on Italian law, according to which taxes (imposta), fees
(tassa) and contributions (contributo) qualify as measures of a fiscal nature (tributi). In
addition, relying on the Italian Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence, Italy submits that the
characteristics of a fiscal nature (tributi) in Italian law are four-fold: (i) dutifulness of the
withdrawal or payment, i.e., whether or not the payment of the measure is mandatory; (ii)
absence of exact reciprocity between the concerned parties; (iii) connection of the
withdrawal or payment to public spending; and (iv) establishment of the fiscal measures by
way of law.*87 In Respondent’s view, these criterion of fiscal measures in Italian law align

with the criterion prescribed in the definitions of “tax” or “tax law” in the glossary of the

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), and in turn with

the OECD’s Model Law 2014.488

In any event, to rebut Claimants’ contentions regarding the interpretation of the Article
21(7) ECT under international law (see {| 491 above), Respondent contends that the
provision should be interpreted in broad terms, in light of the application of Articles 31-33
VCLT. Specifically, in Respondent’s view, the term “imposte” in the Italian version of the
ECT should not be equated to the term “imposta” used in Italian law to refer to “wealth
that is drawn from the citizens in relation to the production of income for the provision of
general services provided by the State”.**? Respondent supports its contentions by relying
on the language used by the other versions of the ECT, specifically, the English, French
and Spanish versions, which also support a wider scope of the term “taxation measures”.
Also, Respondent juxtaposes the use of “misure fiscali” in other parts of Article 21 ECT
(Articles 21(3) and 21(5) specifically) to the term “imposte”, arguing that the latter is

broader than and includes the former.*””

Respondent submits that four of the Italian measures under challenge qualify as measures
of a fiscal nature, and are thus beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. These include Claimants’
claims relating to (i) the Administrative Management Fee; (ii) the imbalance costs regime;
(iii) the Robin Hood Tax; and (iv) classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable
property. In support of this, Respondent places reliance on a recent award rendered by a

tribunal in CEF v. Italy.*%

With respect to the Administrative Management Fee imposed by the Fifth Conto Energia
Decree (see Section IV.F(1) above), Italy submits that this fee was mandatory in the sense
that the GSE could directly offset it against the tariffs to be paid to photovoltaic producers.
Further, Italy contends that the Fee was established as an annual contribution

corresponding to a fixed amount per kWh, and was meant for the overall management of

the incentivization scheme by covering GSE’s management, audit and control expenses.
Accordingly, Italy highlights the absence of reciprocity and the connection to public

spending.*”

With respect to the imposition of imbalance costs on non-programmable energy sources by
Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolutions 281 and 522 (see Section IV.F(3) above),
Respondent contends that the payment of imbalance costs is mandatory in nature. Further,
in Respondent’s view, these costs were imposed for the general mechanism of storage of
electricity by the Italian system operator, i.e., Terna, which has a monopoly over the
activities relating to transmission and dispatching of energy. Wherever there is a monopoly
over such a public function reserved for the State, contributions made in that connection
qualify as fiscal contributions under Italian law. On this basis, Italy submits that the criteria
of absence of reciprocity and the connection to public spending are met by imbalance
costs. In this regard, Italy also relies on the submissions of renewable energy producers
before Italian courts during the challenge to Resolution 281, wherein they admitted that

these imbalance costs qualify as “withdrawal of fiscal nature”.*??

Italy supports its above contentions relating to the Administrative Management Fee and the
imbalance costs by arguing that if these fiscal contributions was not imposed on energy
producers, they would be allocated to the consumers under the A3 Component of the
electricity bills. When such allocation would characterize the measure as one of a fiscal
nature relating to public spending, this characterization is not altered when the costs are
allocated to a different set of stake-holders, i.e., the photovoltaic producers.44
Additionally, Respondent contends that the Administrative Management Fee and
imbalance costs also satisfy the criterion of what constitutes “taxation measures” in

investment arbitration case law, particularly, Murphy v. Ecuador, which is relied on by

Claimants (see {| 491 below). This is on the grounds that they are both mandatory levies
not corresponding to specific services imposed by the Government for public purposes on a

class of persons.*?°

To rebut Claimants’ arguments regarding VAT being payable on the imbalance costs, or
the jurisdiction of tax courts and applicability of Italian double-taxation treaties of
Administrative Management Fee and imbalance costs, Italy states that such labels and titles
are irrelevant to qualify as a measure as a fiscal or taxation measure.**® Further, Italy
explains the Italian Constitutional Court case law, relied on by Claimants, to submit that an
important requirement for qualifying a measure as a fiscal measure was that it should not
be based on a synallagmatic relationship between the parties, the existence of which would
qualify any payment as a contractual consideration, as opposed to a mandatory contribution

towards public spending.*°”

With respect to the Robin Hood Tax imposed by Legislative Decree No. 138/2011 (see
Section IV.F(4) above), Italy states that the same is “unequivocally” a taxation measure,
both as per Italian law, as clarified by the Italian Constitutional Court, and as per the

OECD’s criterion.*°*

Concerning Claimants’ characterization of its claims relating to the Robin Hood Tax,
which implicates the ex nunc application of the Italian Constitutional Court Decision No.
10/2015 (see {| 496 below), Respondent states that the Constitutional Court rendered the
Robin Hood Tax invalid because of the violation of the principle of equality in contributive

reimburse the wrongfully charged Robin Hood Tax would de facto go back to becoming a

Similarly, for the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property done through
Circular No. 36/E by the Revenue Agency in Italy (see Section IV.F(5) above), reliance is
placed by Respondent on the OECD Model Law and the very nature of the measure to
submit that such a classification has the sole function of defining the scope of taxation, and

is at least an ancillary to a taxation measure.>*

Further, Respondent disputes Claimants’ characterization of its claims relating to this
classification as one that does not relate to the taxation measures per se, i.e., the IMU or
TASI Charges, but instead only alleges arbitrariness vis-a-vis the decision to classify
photovoltaic plants as immovable property. According to Respondent, Claimants guise
their claims behind the classification issue, but the substance or “actual target” of their
claim are the IMU and TASI Charges. Moreover, Respondent contends that Claimants
voluntarily chose to file their tax returns (which are self-assessed) by adhering to the
classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property. Such classification, having
been laid down by circulars of the Revenue Agency, were not binding and compliance with
them was voluntary. In any event, in Respondent’s view, had Claimants had an issue with
the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property and its fiscal implications,
they could have sought an “interpello”, i.e., a binding interpretation of fiscal laws from the
concerned local authorities, or should at least have claimed for the refund of the IMU and
TASI Charges from the tax authorities in Italy. Without claiming such a refund, Claimants

could not have been entitled to receive the same automatically by Italy.*"!

photovoltaic plants, being subsidiaries or SPVs acquired by Claimants, exclude this

Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT.

482. These contracts were entered into between 2011 and 2012, i.e., when Claimants were
making their investments in Italy, and each of them, in Article 9, provided for exclusive
jurisdiction in favour of the Court of Rome “[fJor any dispute arising out of or in any way
connected to the interpretation and execution of this Agreement and the documents
referred to therein”.*°? In Respondent’s view, these exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the
GSE contracts are broadly worded and cover not only pure breach of contract disputes, but
also apply to any issue related to the incentives received by the investors, through even the

Conto Energia Decrees.>

483. Further, according to Respondent, these jurisdiction clauses are specific in nature and
applicability, inasmuch as they create rights and obligations between specific parties, and
cannot be overridden by the generic stipulation of State consent in Article 26 ECT, unless
the ECT itself provides for such priority. The ECT, instead, permits dispute resolution

through any agreed dispute settlement procedure other than international arbitration,
including dispute resolution by way of courts.°*

484. Respondent supports the above submissions by relying on investment arbitration case law,
in which tribunals denied jurisdiction over (or the admissibility of) claims covered by
contractual exclusive jurisdiction clauses for considerations such as generalia specialibus
non derogant, or the priority of specifically negotiated contractual clauses over generic

expressions of consent in treaties.*°> Further, Respondent highlights that the administrative

Notably, Respondent also alternatively raise the above objections as arguments relating to
the inadmissibility of Claimants’ claims, in the event the Tribunal does not consider them

to affect its jurisdiction.>!”

(2) Claimants’ Position

a. None of Claimants’ claims contest the Application of “Taxation

Measures”
Claimants dispute Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to Article 21 ECT on the
grounds that (i) the Administrative Management Fee and the imbalance costs are not
“taxation measures” as per Article 21(7) ECT; and (ii) Claimants’ claims relating to the
Robin Hood Tax and the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property are

not claims against the “taxation measures” per se.

With respect to the Administrative Management Fee and the imbalance costs, Claimants
submit that Italy’s argument is based on a flawed premise of equating “taxes” or “taxation
measures” to “fiscal measures”. Such expansion of the definition of “taxation measures” is
not supported in the text of Article 21(7)(a) ECT, the official Italian version of which uses
the term “imposte” instead of the term used by Respondent for “fiscal measures”, i.e.,

“tributi? 5"!

Alternatively, Claimants submit that the reliance on domestic law for characterization of
measures as “taxation measures”, while helpful, is not determinative of this issue. In this
connection, Claimants rely on investment arbitration case law to enlist an independent
criterion for determining what is a “taxation measure” under international investment law.
This criterion require (i) taxation measures to be “related to the imposition of a liability on
classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes and without any direct
benefit to the taxpayer”; (ii) accounting for the plain text of the legal provision imposing

the taxation measure in addition to the domestic constitutional framework; and (iii) bona

fide actions motivated by the purpose of raising State revenue.>!

492. It is Claimants’ position that none of these criteria are met by the Administrative
Management Fee or the imbalance costs. Claimants contend that both these measures are
not motivated towards increasing State revenue, nor are they intended for a public purpose.
Instead, they are to be paid by photovoltaic producers for exchange of specific services of
either “GSE’s management, monitoring and verification tasks” or “to assume the
dispatching services costs” of Terna. Further, Claimants highlight that the sources of these
measures, be it the Fifth Conto Energia Decree or the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s
Resolutions 281 and 522, do not use the term “taxes” to describe these measures in their
plain text, but instead use terms such as “contributions” or “compensations”. In this regard,
Claimants also place reliance on the findings of the Greentech v. Italy tribunal, which

found these that these two measures in question did not qualify as “taxation measures”.>!

493.

wo

In addition, Claimants allege that the Administrative Management Fee and the imbalance

costs are not bona fide taxation measures, since they were enacted to reduce incentive

payments previously guaranteed to renewable energy producers.>!*

494. In the further alternative, Claimants submit that the purely domestic understanding of
“imposte” or taxes under Italian law also does not support Respondent’s categorization. In
addition to disputing the criterion relied on by Respondent for determining what qualifies

as a “taxation measure” in Italian law,>!> Claimants make three further arguments. First,

Claimants submit that imbalance costs fall within the “network and dispatching service”
constituent of the A3 Component, and not the separate “taxes” constituent. Second,
Claimants rely on GSE’s balance sheet to highlight that imbalance costs are treated as
“income from sales and services”, which in turn are subjected to corporate income tax and
VAT. Third, Claimants point out that the Administrative Management Fee and the
imbalance costs are not included in the type of fiscal measures over which Italian tax
courts have jurisdiction, primarily because, as clarified in Italian Constitutional Court
jurisprudence, measures covering service costs and liable for VAT are excluded from the
jurisdiction of tax courts. Similarly, neither the Administrative Management Fee and the

imbalance costs are covered under Italian double-taxation treaties.>!

495. With respect to the Robin Hood Tax and the classification of photovoltaic plants as
immovable property, Claimants’ position is that their claims concerning these measures do
not dispute “taxation measures” as defined by the ECT, nor do they dispute the existence
or application of these taxes. Instead, the taxes in question are only relevant to the

background of these claims.°!”

496. Claimants’ only claim concerning the Robin Hood Tax, which has already been declared
unconstitutional by the Italian Constitutional Court in Decision No. 10/2015 (see {J 244-
248 above), is that the Constitutional Court Decision’s ex nunc, rather than ex tunc,
application was unfair. Similarly, for the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable
property, Claimants contest the fact that Italy’s correction of this classification in 2016 did
not result in a refund of the wrongly imposed IMU and TASI Charges under the earlier
arbitrary classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property, which Claimants had

paid in good faith.*!®

b. Exclusive jurisdiction clause in GSE contracts

497. In response to Respondent’s jurisdictional (and alternatively, admissibility) objection
relating to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the GSE contracts, Claimants make two

arguments.

498. First, Claimants challenge the relevance of that argument on the ground that none of the
Claimants was a signatory to, or bound by, the contracts entered into with the GSE. The
contracts were instead executed by entities separate from Claimants. Thus, the exclusive
jurisdiction clauses in the GSE contracts do not apply to Claimants, nor do they amount to
a previously agreed dispute resolution mechanism between Claimants and Italy, i.e., the
two Parties in this ECT arbitration. On this basis, Claimants also distinguish the cases
relied on by Respondent, particularly the SGS v. Philippines case and the BIVAC v.
Paraguay case, in both of which the claimants were party to the contracts being
considered.>!° Instead, Claimants place reliance on the Greentech v. Italy award, which, as

per Claimants, was factually closer to the present case and was correctly decided.>”°

499. Second, Claimants contend that they are not seeking a resolution of a breach of contract
claim in these ECT proceedings. Instead, their claims pertain strictly to a breach of treaty,
in which the GSE contracts are merely incidentally relevant as evidence of specific
obligations that Italy entered into but failed to fulfil in violation of the ECT’s Umbrella

Clause.*?!

c. The requirement of amicable settlement under Article 26(1)
ECT has been fulfilled
500. Claimants rebut Respondent’s jurisdiction (and alternatively, admissibility) objection

concerning the requirement of amicable settlement by making two arguments.

501. First, Claimants point out that their letter of 4 May 2016 specifically mentioned the
harmful impact that Italy’s expansion of the Robin Hood Tax and the measures exposing
Claimants’ plants to the IMU and TASI Charges had on their investments. Thus, these

claims cannot be considered as “new” ones.>””

502. Second, Claimants submit that claims develop over time and over the course of the
arbitration proceeding. With such development of claims, claimants cannot be required to
initiate fresh disputes by notifying respondents and requesting an amicable settlement on
every occasion. So long as the initial notice of dispute and amicable settlement was
“related to the same dispute” or concerned “substantially the same subject matter”, the
formal requirement of amicable settlement should not inhibit a tribunal’s jurisdiction. This
is even more so when attempts at amicable resolution are unlikely to succeed, and when
the notice period for amicable settlement is likely to expire prior to the tribunal having the

chance to look at its jurisdiction, as is the case here>?

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

In this Section, the Tribunal shall determine Respondent’s other objections relating to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction and to the admissibility of Claimants’ claims. This determination
shall be made simultaneously for the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, to the extent

they overlap.

The Tribunal shall determine (1) first, Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to
Article 21 ECT; (2) second, Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections
relating to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the GSE Contracts; and (3) third,
Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections relating to the requirement of
amicable settlement of the disputes in Article 26 ECT prior to initiation of arbitration

proceedings.

(1) Taxation Measures under Article 21 ECT

Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on the basis of the exclusion of
“taxation measures” in Article 21 ECT, arguing that since a number of the measures
challenged by Claimants amount to “taxation measures”, the ECT does not create any

rights or impose any obligations in their respect.

In this regard, Claimants and Respondent are in dispute about the (a) the legal standard to
be applied for a determination of what qualifies as a “taxation measure”; (b) whether the
Administrative Management Fee imposed by the Fifth Conto Energia (see Section IV.F(1)
above) amounts to a “taxation measure”; (c) whether the Imbalance Costs imposed by the
Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolutions 281 and 522 (see Section IV.F(3) above)
amount to “taxation measures”; (d) whether Claimants’ claims in relation to the Robin
Hood Tax imposed by Legislative Decree No. 138/2011 (see Section IV.F(4) above)
constitute disputes relating to “taxation measures”; and (e) whether Claimants’ claims in
relation to the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property done through
Circular No. 36/E by the Revenue Agency in Italy (see Section IV.F(5) above) constitute
disputes relating to “taxation measures”. The Tribunal shall address these disputed issues

in turn below.

a. Legal Standard

The contested matter between the Parties concerning the legal standard for a determination
of what qualifies as a “taxation measure” is whether this standard should be derived from

domestic law or from international law.

To resolve this matter, the Tribunal considers is beneficial to reproduce the text of Article

21(7)(a) ECT below, which defines the term “taxation measure”:
For the purposes of this Article:
(a) The term “Taxation Measure” includes:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local
authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance
of double taxation or of any other international agreement or
arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.
Interpreting this provision in accordance with Article 31 VCLT (quoted in {| 289 above),
the Tribunal delineates two key characteristics of a “taxation measure”, based on the
ordinary meaning of the terms used in the provision: (i) a taxation measure shall be in the
form of a provision, either in the domestic law of the Contracting Party in question or in an
international convention or agreement of that Contracting Party; and (ii) that provision

shall be related to taxes.

Given that the provision that contains the taxation measure should either be codified by the
Contracting Party in question (or by a political subdivision thereof or a local authority
therein) or be part of an international convention or agreement of that Contracting Party,
the Tribunal considers it important to look at the law of that Contracting Party for an
answer to the question of what constitutes a provision “relating to taxes”, and, in turn, a
“taxation measure”. This is particularly in light of the object and purpose behind treaty

provisions such as Article 21 ECT, which the Tribunal considers are intended for the

Contracting Parties to preserve fiscal sovereignty over tax related matters.>*4 In the instant

case, the Contracting Party in question is Italy.

In this connection, it is also important to note that neither Claimants nor Respondent argue
that domestic law is immaterial to the question of what constitutes a “taxation measure”.
The dispute lies in the extent of importance that the Parties afford to domestic law. While
Respondent places exclusive reliance on the Italian domestic law understanding of
“taxation measures”, Claimants rely primarily on an autonomous international law
standard, but simultaneously admit that domestic law “may be helpful in ascertaining” the

nature of the measure (see {| 491 above).°?>

The Tribunal further notes that the cases relied upon by Claimants to derive an
international law standard for “taxation measures” also recognize the relevance of domestic
law for this issue. Although none of those cases involved Article 21 ECT, their respective
analyses of the tax carve-outs in the BITs in question did consider domestic law while
determining whether the measure in question was a “taxation measure” or a “matter of

taxation”.
For instance, the tribunal in Murphy Exploration v. Republic of Ecuador found that:

The purpose of Article X specifically is to preserve the States’ sovereignty in
relation to their power to impose taxes in their territory. Most governments
view these powers as a central element of sovereignty.

The Tribunal finds that, for it to assess whether a measure is one which was
meant to be excluded from an international arbitral tribunal’s purview because
it concerns a State’s sovereign power of taxation, it is necessary for the
Tribunal to examine whether that measure comes within the State’s domestic
tax regime.>6

of Ecuador when interpreting the tax carve-out provision of the respective BITs, examined

Ecuador’s domestic legal tax regime.*?”

. Accordingly, without conclusively deciding at this stage whether and to what extent

domestic law has to be supplemented by an autonomous international law understanding of
taxation measures, the Tribunal considers that Italian domestic law is the appropriate
starting point to examine whether the measures in question fall within the carve out for
taxation measures in Article 21 ECT. However, it is important to clarify that this does not
entail declaring a measure as a tax measure simply on the basis that the domestic legal
system calls it or characterizes it as such. The Tribunal considers it imperative to look at
the criteria prescribed in domestic law for what qualifies as a taxation measure thereunder,

and examine the measures in question against this criteria.

With respect to the criteria in Italian law for a measure to qualify as a taxation measure,
both Claimants and Respondent have made distinct submissions. Respondent uses the
understanding of “fiscal measures” (¢ributi, in Italian) in Italian law and extends it to
taxation measures.*** To this end, Respondent advances the following four criteria for
measures of a fiscal nature based on the Italian Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence*”? (see

{470 above):

(i) dutifulness of the withdrawal or payment, i.e., whether or not the payment of the

measure is mandatory;
(ii) absence of exact reciprocity between the concerned parties;
(iii) connection of the withdrawal or payment to public spending; and

(iv) _ establishment of the fiscal measures by way of law.

On the other hand, Claimants submit that Respondent’s premise of comparing taxation
measures to fiscal measures is flawed, since the concept of fiscal measures is very broad,
whereas Article 21(7)(a) ECT clearly applies only to one aspect of such fiscal measures,
i.e., those that relate to taxes (imposte in Italian) (see { 490 above). With respect to the
understanding of measures that relate to taxes or imposte, Claimants rely on scholarly

writings to enlist the following criteria:**°

(i) _ the measure is based on the principle of societal solidarity and on the financial ability

of the taxpayer to contribute to the general public expenditure;
(ii) the payment is involuntary;

(iii) the payment is not related to any specific benefit, service, or activity provided by

public institutions;

(iv) the payment is generally intended for public and social purposes that are not

specifically identified;
(v) | the payment is based on the principle of redistribution; and
(vi) the payment is conceived of as the ultimate expression of State sovereignty.

With respect to the distinction between fiscal measures (tributi) and taxation measures
(imposte), the Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ submission that the former term appears to
much broader than the latter. Apart from the fact that the term “fiscal measures” does not
appear in Article 21(7)(a) ECT, even conceptually, fiscal measures could include a number
of measures, including but not limited to measures relating to taxes. Moreover, even from
the Italian version of the ECT, which is an authentic text as per Article 50 ECT, it appears
that the language used in Article 21(7)(a) ECT corresponding the English phrase “any
provision relating to taxes” is “qualsiasi disposizione sulle imposte” (emphasis added).

Claimants and Respondent agree that the term “imposte” or “imposta” is a literal

translation of the English word “taxes whereas the translation of “fiscal measures”

appears to be “tributi”,*? which term is not mentioned in the Italian version of Article
21(7) ECT. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers the term “fiscal measures” to be broader

than, but inclusive of, taxation measures.

That being said, in respect of the distinct criteria that Claimants and Respondent enlist for
what qualifies as a measure relating to taxes (or taxation measure) in Italian law (see {]
516-517 above), the Tribunal considers a number of these criterion to overlap with one
another. For instance, Respondent’s first criteria relating to the dutifulness of the payment,
i.e., whether or not the payment of the measure is mandatory, is parallel to Claimants’
second criteria, i.e., the payment is involuntary. Similarly, Respondent’s second criteria,
i.e., the absence of exact reciprocity between the concerned parties, overlaps, in essence,
with Claimants’ third criteria, i.e., the payment is not related to any specific benefit,
service, or activity provided by public institutions. Respondent’s third criteria, i.e., the
connection of the payment to public spending, aligns, to some extent, with Claimants’ first
criteria, i.e., the measure is based on the principle of societal solidarity and on the financial
ability of the taxpayer to contribute to the general public expenditure. There is also a
significant overlap between Respondent’s second and third criteria and Claimants’ fourth
criteria, i.e., the payment is generally intended for public and social purposes that are not
specifically identified. Respondent’s fourth criteria, i.e., the establishment of the fiscal
measures by way of law, is a criteria that already finds place in the bare text of Article

21(7)(a) ECT, as discussed in {| 508-510 above.

In light of the above, the Tribunal considers Claimants’ and Respondent’s respective
criterion for what qualifies as a taxation measure in Italy to be in agreement in many
respects. Accordingly, in addition to examining the legal source that imposes the measure

in question, the Tribunal shall analyse each of the contested measures in question based on

SoD, J 150; SoRy, | 165; R-SoRj, | 211. Although Respondent attempts to distinguish the term “imposte”
“imposta”, stating that the former is broader in meaning than the latter, the Tribunal does not consider it
ection of these two terms. It suffices to state that regardless of any

  

distinction between these terms “imposte” and “imposta”, the definition of “taxation measures” (or “misura fiscale”)
in Article 21(7) ECT does not include all kinds of “fiscal measures” (or “tributi”).

the common denominator in the Parties’ respective criterion, which the Tribunal enlists as

follows:

(i) Whether the payment is involuntary or mandatory in nature, i.e., dutifulness of the

payment;

(ii) Whether the payment is made in exchange of any specific benefit, service, or
activity provided by public institutions, i.e., whether the relationship between the

payer and the public institution in question evidences reciprocity; and

(iii) | Whether the payment is made as a contribution to public spending or public

expenditure, and is generally intended for a public purpose.

In order for any measure to qualify as a “taxation measure”, the first and third questions
above should be answered in the affirmative, whereas the second one should be answered

in the negative.

The Tribunal also incidentally notes that the above three criteria align with the autonomous
international law understanding of a “taxation measure” relied upon by Claimants (see [
491 above). For instance, the tribunal in Murphy v. Ecuador, defined a “matter of taxation”
(the equivalent phrase in question in the BIT at issue in that case) as being “related to the
imposition of a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes
and without any direct benefit to the taxpayer”.°*? This definition, which as per Claimants
is extendable to the term “taxation measures” in Article 21(7) ECT, includes within itself
the three requirements enlisted in { 520 above, ie., (i) the mandatory nature of the payment
(“imposition of a liability”); (ii) the absence of reciprocity (“without any direct benefit to
the taxpayer”); and (iii) contribution to public spending or expenditure (“for public
purposes”).

During the Hearing, Respondent stated that the most essential criteria amongst the ones

discussed above are the mandatory nature of the payment and the absence of reciprocity.>*+

The Tribunal agrees with this proposition. With respect to the remaining criterion
Claimants have advanced (see {| 517 above), i.e., (i) the payment being based on the
principle of redistribution; and (ii) the payment being the ultimate expression of State
sovereignty, the Tribunal shall consider them only if and to the extent it deems necessary

b. Administrative Management Fee

As mentioned in Section IV.F(1) above, the Administrative Management Fee was imposed
in the Fifth Conto Energia Decree. In particular, the relevant provisions in the Fifth Conto
Energia Decree imposing the Administrative Management Fee on the photovoltaic power

plant operators were Articles 10.4 to 10.6, which are reproduced below:
Article 10

(Management of incentive system and application rules)

4. To cover GSE management costs, and the cost of checks and controls by
GSE, the plant operators that access incentive tariffs under this decree and
decrees issued in implementation of article 7 of legislative decree no. 387,
2003 [Off-Take Regime] and article 25 (10) of legislative decree no. 28, 2011
[Romani Decree], are under_an obligation, commencing from | January 2013,
to pay GSE a contribution of 0.05 euro cents for each kWh of subsidised
energy, also by means of offset with incentives owed.

 

 

5. GSE will publish the application rules for enrolment in the registers and
access to the incentive tariffs under this decree within thirty days of the
effective date of the decree.

6. The procedures for payment of the contributions under paragraphs | and 4

are specified by GSE in the context of the application rules under paragraph

5.°*> (emphasis added)

the Spalma-incentivi Decree of 2014, which provides, inter alia, for the imposition, rates
and method of payment for such Administrative Management Fee that were imposed “by

the GSE for [its] conduct of management, audit and control activities, related to the

 

incentive and support mechanisms . . .”°*7

Having laid out the relevant legal provisions dealing with the Administrative Management
Fee, the Tribunal shall examine whether this Fee satisfies the three-fold criteria prescribed

in {520 above, in order to qualify as a taxation measure.

First, with respect to the mandatory nature of the payment, the Tribunal notes that
Claimants have not specifically contested the fact that the Administrative Management Fee
is mandatory or involuntary in nature. It is evident that the Administrative Management
Fee was legislatively imposed by way of the Fifth Conto Energia Decree as a mandatory
contribution. This is demonstrated, inter alia, by the use of the phrase “the plant operators .

. are under an obligation” in Article 10.4 of the Fifth Conto Energia Decree, which is
emphasised in the quotation in { 523 above. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers this
requirement concerning the mandatory nature of the payment to have been satisfied by the

Administrative Management Fee.

Second, with respect to the absence of reciprocity requirement, i.e., whether the
Administrative Management Fee is paid in exchange of any specific benefit, service, or
activity provided by the concerned public institutions, the Parties are in dispute.
Respondent’s position is that the motivations behind the imposition of the Administrative
Management Fee, i.e., covering GSE’s management, audit and control expenses, evidences
the absence of reciprocity in the imposition of this Fee (see {| 473 above). Claimants argue
that since the Administrative Management Fee are to be paid by photovoltaic producers for
exchange of specific services of either GSE’s management, monitoring and verification

tasks, there is an absence of reciprocity characterizing the payment (see {| 492 above).

The Tribunal considers that the Parties’ respective characterizations of the motivations

behind the imposition of the Administrative Management Fee are not at divergence.

Claimants and Respondent agree that the Administrative Management Fee was intended to

cover GSE’s management. In fact, as per Respondent, the Administrative Management Fee

was meant to sustain GSE’s management costs in the face of increase in its functions.***

The question to be determined is whether against the payment of this Administrative

Management Fee, GSE would be providing any benefit, service, or activity for the

photovoltaic plant operators. In this regard, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to refer to

the legal instruments imposing the Administrative Management Fee, to examine its precise

purpose in order to determine whether the same was to be paid in exchange of any benefit,

service, or activity to be provided by the GSE. The following indicators are available in

these legal instruments:

(iii)

Article 10.4 of the Fifth Conto Energia Decree provides that the Administrative
Management Fee was intended “[t]o cover GSE management costs, and the cost of

checks and controls by GSE” (see {523 above);

One of the Recitals in the preamble of the Fifth Conto Energia indicates that the
reason for imposing the Administrative Management Fee on the photovoltaic plant
operators, as opposed to attributing them entirely to the end consumers, was that it
was “advisable and fair that coverage of charges for the management of the
photovoltaic incentive system shall involve contributions from persons that benefit

from the photovoltaic incentive tariffs . . .”**° (emphasis added);

Articles 25(1) and 25(2) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree, which confirms that the
Administrative Management Fee was imposed “by the GSE for [its] conduct of
management, audit and control activities, related_to the incentive _and_support
mechanisms, are to be borne by the beneficiaries of the same activities . . .”™“?

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

From the above quoted legal stipulations in the Fifth Conto Energia Decree and the
Spalma-incentivi Decree, it becomes evident that the Administrative Management Fee was
(i) imposed only on the photovoltaic plant operators and not the end consumers, since they
were the direct beneficiaries of the incentive tariff regime; and (ii) intended to cover GSE’s
management, audit and control/verification services specifically related to this incentive
tariff system. Accordingly, the Administrative Management Fee was imposed specifically
in exchange of GSE’s services relating to the management of the incentive tariff regime.
GSE, as mentioned in { 121 above, was the implementing body for this incentive tariff

regime.

Further evidence of this link between the Administrative Management Fee and the GSE’s
services towards the photovoltaic plant operators comes from the fact that, pursuant to its
powers in Articles 10.5 and 10.6 of the Fifth Conto Energia Decree to determine the
method of payment of, inter alia, the Administrative Management Fee, GSE clarified on its
website in 2013 that the Administrative Management Fee shall be offset against GSE’s first
payment of incentive tariffs to any producer in a given year.™*! Respondent also admits that
“GSE can directly offset [the Administrative Management Fee] against the tariffs to be
paid to producers”.*“? Given that the Administrative Management Fee can be directly offset
against the incentive tariffs paid as per the Conto Energia Decrees, it amounts to a mere
adjustment of these incentive tariffs, which are in the nature of subsidies, and does not

qualify as a measure related to taxes.

In this connection, Respondent did not dispute this link between the Administrative
Management Fee and the GSE’s services upon being questioned about the same during the

Hearing:

THE CHAIRMAN: Now, you can look at it in two ways. One is to say: the
whole apparatus of the state, anything you have to contribute to make it work is
atax. Or you say: in order to make the payment of the tariffs and also the
management of the tariffs work, you have to pay a fee. That could have been
included in the tariff as part of the tariff, that the money was on that side. Or
you say: now you have to pay something extra for managing the tariff. But

why would that be elevated to a tax? It’s simply a question I have, because if
you say that a subsidy is a tax, then it's something new.

MR GIORDANO: Just that they have a mandatory aspect. But I will cover it

later 53
In light of the above, the Tribunal considers that Administrative Management Fee is
characterized by a reciprocal relationship between the photovoltaic plant operators and the
concerned public institution, i.e., GSE, whereby GSE performs services concerning the
management of the incentive tariff regime in exchange of this Fee. Respondent’s
arguments that the Administrative Management Fee are not “related to a particular activity
from GSE”*4 or do not “imply a specific synallagmatic relation with a single market
operator”*#5 do not convince the Tribunal otherwise. For the absence of reciprocity
requirement, it is not necessary that the benefit, service or activity being performed by the
public institution concerned arise out of a direct and specific synallagmatic relation
between the public institution and the party obliged to pay the concerned fee. It suffices
that the payment in question, i.e., the Administrative Management Fee in the present case,
is paid in exchange of services or activities rendered for the direct benefit of the
party/parties making the payment, i.e., the photovoltaic plant operators including

Claimants’ SPVs, and in turn Claimants.

Another indicator of the Administrative Management Fee not being a taxation measure
under Italian law is that the same is excluded from the jurisdiction of Italian tax courts on
the grounds that it (i) covers service costs through tariff components; and (ii) is itself liable
for VAT.*° The Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’ submission (see {| 494 above), and
their reliance on the Italian Constitutional Court jurisprudence in this regard.**”

determinative of whether it qualifies a tax under Italian law, does not per se contest
Claimants’ submission about the jurisdiction of Italian tax courts over measures such as the

Administrative Management Fee (see {| 476 above).

In support of the Tribunal’s findings regarding the Administrative Management Fee,
reference may be made to the following conclusions of the tribunal in the recently decided
Greentech v. Italy case:
In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the administrative fee was
established specifically to cover the GSE’s costs of managing the incentive
programs from which PV producers benefited. This suggests a degree of
reciprocity. The Tribunal also notes that Respondent does not deny that the
GSE paid value added taxes (VAT) on amounts received from PV producers,
and that the fee was not collected for the general revenue of Italy. Taken
together, these factors indicate that the administrative fee is not a Taxation
Measure under the ECT.*“*
Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that since the relationship between GSE and
Claimants evidences reciprocity, the Administrative Management Fee does not qualify as a
taxation measure for failure of satisfying the second criteria enlisted in {| 520 above, and
thus does not fall within the definition of “taxation measure” in Article 21(7) ECT.
Therefore, Claimants’ claims in relation to the Administrative Management Fee are not
excluded from the protection of the ECT pursuant to Article 21(1) ECT, and Respondent’s

jurisdictional objection in this regard fails.

On account of the above findings, the Tribunal need not examine the third criteria enlisted
in { 520 above, i.e., whether the Administrative Management Fee qualifies as a payment
that is made as a contribution to public spending or public expenditure, and is generally
intended for a public purpose. It suffices to state that the above findings regarding the
absence of reciprocity requirement ({[J 527-536 above) are dispositive of this issue, even in

respect of this third criteria.

c. Imbalance Costs

With respect to the imbalance costs imposed on non-programmable energy sources by the
Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolutions 281 and 522 (see Section IV.F(3) above),
Respondent correctly states that “[t]he same reasoning” as for the Administrative
Management Fee “should apply”,*’? albeit advocating for the opposite conclusion. Indeed.
the Tribunal considers that a number of factors, discussed in Section VII.D(1)(b) above
concerning the Administrative Management Fee, are equally relevant for and determinative
of Respondent’s jurisdictional challenge concerning the imbalance costs under Article 21

ECT.

Again, to determine whether the imbalance costs qualify as a taxation measure excluded
from the purview of the ECT pursuant to Article 21(1) ECT, it shall be determined whether

they satisfy the three-fold criteria enlisted in { 520 above.

First, similar to the Administrative Management Fee, there is no dispute between the
Parties that the imbalance costs, which were imposed by the Italian Electrical Energy
Authority first in the 2012 Resolution 281 and subsequently in the 2015 Resolution 522,
were mandatory or non-voluntary in nature. Indeed, the mandatory nature of this payment
is evidenced from the language used in Resolution 522, which states that “[t]he production
units fed by non-programmable renewable sources must be subject to regulation of

imbalances”.**° (emphasis added)

Second, with respect to the absence of reciprocity requirement, the Tribunal finds
significant overlaps in the situations of the Administrative Management Fee and the

imbalance costs. For instance:

(i) Imbalance costs constitute payments that are made in exchange for the dispatching
services provided by Terna, which is the Italian system operator that manages the
wholesale electricity market and fixes the prices.*>! Respondent has admitted the

same in clear terms in its submissions and during the Hearing. As per Respondent,

imbalance costs were imposed “for the general mechanism of storage of electricity

by Terna”>>>

and thus “relate to the dispatching of energy . . . [which] is reserved to
the State and granted in concession to Terna”.*°? During the Hearing, Respondent
confirmed that “imbalance costs are linked to the organisation of the supply of
[photovoltaic] electricity into the national grid by Terna, which executes such
activities in a regime of monopoly, and whose functions are of general interest.”°*4
Indeed, the language of Resolution 281 clearly confirms that the imbalances costs

relate to “dispatching services”.**>

Further, imbalance costs are enlisted as “income from sales and services” in the
balance sheets of GSE, and are subjected to corporate income tax and to ordinary
VAT, just as any commercial income derived from services would be.**° Similar to
the Administrative Management Fee, imbalance costs would thus not fall within the
jurisdiction of Italian tax courts for reasons mentioned in {| 534 above.” Respondent

does not dispute any of this.

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s counter-arguments that there is no
specific service that the photovoltaic plant operators obtain from Terna,>°* or that
Terna has a monopoly over the dispatch services, and thus any fee paid in that regard
should be considered as a fiscal measure.>>? As mentioned in { 533 above, a
reciprocal relationship based on services performed by a public institution such as
Terna does not require that the said services be derived from a specific synallagmatic
relation, or be specifically directed at certain photovoltaic plant operators. Further,

the fact that Terna does not have a competitor also does not alter the nature of the

payment being made by photovoltaic plant operators in exchange of the services

being performed by Terna.

In light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that imbalance costs cannot be considered as
measures that are, or in any way relate to, taxes under Italian law, since they are predicated
on a reciprocal relationship. This conclusion also finds support in the following passages
from the award in Greentech v. Italy case:

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal notes that the imbalance costs

relate to electricity dispatching services, an identified service, and thus are

not allocated to the State’s general revenue. Further, Respondent did not

deny Claimants’ assertion that corporate income taxes and VAT were paid

on amounts received from PV producers, that the AEEG did not categorize

imbalance costs under the category of “taxes” but instead categorized them

as “network and dispatching services”, and that Italy has not otherwise

treated imbalance costs as a tax. Taken together, these factors minimize the

significance of Respondent’s assertion that the mandatory nature of the

charges make them similar to charges for municipal waste services, which

themselves might not constitute a Taxation Measure under the ECT.*°
Accordingly, Claimants’ claims in relation to the imbalance costs are not excluded from
the protection of the ECT pursuant to Article 21(1) ECT, and Respondent’s jurisdictional

objection in this regard fails.

On account of the above findings, the Tribunal need not examine the third criteria enlisted
in { 520 above, i.e., whether the imbalance costs qualify as a payment that are made as a
contribution to public spending or public expenditure, and are generally intended for a
public purpose. It suffices to state that the above findings regarding the absence of
reciprocity requirement ({{J 541-542 above) are dispositive of this issue, even in respect of

this third criteria.

enlisted in { 520 above, and/or any other criteria that may be relevant for the purposes of
Article 21(7) ECT. For Respondent, the Robin Hood Tax is “unequivocally” a taxation
measure.**! Claimants, too, do not present any objections to the proposition that the Robin
Hood Tax, which was imposed by Law No. 133/2008 on 6 August 2008 as a tax on
windfall profits and later extended to photovoltaic plants by Law No. 148/2011 on 14

September 2011, was a taxation measure.

Instead, Claimants’ opposition to Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under Article 21(1)
ECT is limited to the argument that their claim in these arbitration proceedings concerns
only the propriety and implications of an Italian Constitutional Court’s Decision No.
10/2015 concerning the Robin Hood Tax (see {| 244 in Section IV.F(4) above), and not the
Tax itself. This Constitutional Court Decision No. 10/2015 declared the Legislative Decree
No. 112/2008, upon which the Law No. 133/2008 was based, unconstitutional in part. The
Constitutional Court Decision was applicable ex nunc, i.e., prospectively.* While, at this
stage, it is not necessary or appropriate to revisit the precise motivations behind the
Constitutional Court Decision No. 10/2015, it suffices to state that the two aspects that are
disputed between the Parties in this regard are (i) firstly, whether the Decision should or
should not have been applied ex nunc, instead of ex tunc, by the Constitutional Court; and
(ii) secondly, whether the Constitutional Court invalidated the Robin Hood Tax for
violation of the principle of equality in contributive capacity or was the finding of

unconstitutionality influenced by the extension of the Tax to renewable energy facilities.

With respect to the above disputed issues about the Constitutional Court Decision No.
10/2015, Claimants’ position is that none of these issues pertains to or implicates a taxation
measure under Article 21(7) ECT, and thus Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under
Article 21(1) ECT must fail (see {| 496 above). To the contrary, Respondent contends that
Claimants’ characterization of their claims relating to the Robin Hood Tax, i.e., concerning
the propriety of an ex nunc application of the Constitutional Court Decision and Italy’s

alleged refusal to reimburse the Robin Hood Tax that was wrongfully imposed on

photovoltaic plants, would de facto go back to becoming a claim about the propriety of the

taxation measure itself, i.e., the Robin Hood Tax (see {478 above).

For the purposes of Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under Article 21(1) ECT, the
Tribunal is only required to determine the Parties’ disagreement about Claimants’
characterization of their claim relating to the Robin Hood Tax. This entails, in particular,
the question of whether Claimants’ claim will inevitably require a determination of the

propriety of the Robin Hood Tax itself.

Based on a review of the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal is convinced by Respondent’s
submission that the Tribunal’s examination of Claimants’ claim on the Robin Hood Tax, as
presented by Claimants, “would go back to the evaluation of the substantive content of the
Robin Hood Tax and become de facto a claim on the taxation measure itself.”°° Indeed, it
is not possible to decide the two disputed issues emanating from the Constitutional Court’s
Decision No. 10/2015, mentioned in { 546 above, without also determining, or at least
addressing, the substantive propriety of the Robin Hood Tax itself and its subsequent

extension to photovoltaic facilities.

It is apparent from Claimants’ own submissions on the merits that their claim relating to
the Robin Hood Tax is not restricted only to the propriety and implications of the
Constitutional Court Decision No. 10/2015. At the centre of Claimants’ claim is their
contention that the Constitutional Court Decision was directed at the unlawful application
of the Robin Hood Tax to photovoltaic facilities.*° Regardless of whether or not that was
indeed one of the motivations behind the Constitutional Court Decision, in order to
establish their claim, Claimants predicate their arguments on the merits on the impropriety
of the Robin Hood Tax’s extension to photovoltaic facilities. To this end, Claimants, inter
alia, submit that they had legitimate expectations that the Robin Hood Tax would not be

applied to renewable energy facilities. Once the Robin Hood Tax was so applied, these

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)
legitimate expectations were breached, resulting in a breach of the ECT.*® In Claimants’
own words:
When Claimants first invested in Italy, they reasonably expected that the Robin
Hood [T]ax would not apply to their plants. Italy had explicitly affirmed the

exclusion of renewable energy producers from the Robin Hood [T]ax in a 2010
circular issued by the Italian Revenue Agency.

However, in August 2011, Italy unexpectedly and arbitrarily broadened the
scope of the Robin Hood [T]ax by extending it to all energy producers,
including renewable energy producers, with a gross annual income of over
[EUR] 10 million and taxable income of over [EUR] | million.

[I]n June 2013, Italy again unexpectedly and arbitrarily extended the scope of

the Robin Hood [T]ax by reducing the applicable income thresholds to gross

annual income over [EUR] 3 million and taxable income over [EUR] 300,000.

This resulted in the application of the Robin Hood [T]ax to Claimants’

photovoltaic plants.”
The above arguments of Claimants evidence that in order to adjudicate Claimants’ claim,
the Tribunal will need to examine the nature of the Robin Hood Tax and whether it should
have been extended to photovoltaic facilities. Accordingly, Claimants’ characterization of
their claim as relating only to the propriety and implications of the Constitutional Court
Decision No. 10/2015 is contradicted by their own submissions on the merits. The Tribunal
considers that any determination on the Constitutional Court Decision, which was a sequel
to the imposition of the Robin Hood Tax, will implicitly entail a decision on the preceding
incidence of the Robin Hood Tax itself. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with
Respondent’s argument that “[i]t is not possible to separate the application of a decision

regarding a tax from the same tax measure.”°*

Further evidence of the fact that Claimants’ claim, in reality, relates to the propriety and
application of the Robin Hood Tax and not the ensuing Constitutional Court Decision No.
10/2015, comes from Claimants’ request for relief on this issue. Claimants request this
Tribunal, as part of their damages claim, to compensate them for sums they paid to Italy

under an unconstitutional taxation regime. Thus, Claimants’ requested relief on this issue
directly relates to and requests the reimbursement of the Robin Hood Tax itself, and does
not concern the Constitutional Court’s Decision No. 10/2015 per se, which Claimants
themselves laud as a correct decision, barring its ex nunc or prospective effect.°© In light
of this, Claimants cannot dissociate their claim, which they unsuccessfully attempt to root
in the Constitutional Court Decision, from the underlying taxation measure at issue, i.e.,

the Robin Hood Tax.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Claimants’ claim concerning the Robin Hood Tax is a
claim with respect to taxation measures. Therefore, Respondent’s jurisdictional objection
under Article 21(1) ECT succeeds, insofar as it concerns Claimants’ claim relating to the

Robin Hood Tax.

In light of the fact that none of the Parties disputes that the Robin Hood Tax and its
imposition on the photovoltaic facilities is a taxation measure (see {| 545 above), the
Tribunal need not separately examine whether the specific requirements for qualifying as a
taxation measure under Article 21(7) ECT (see { 520 above) are satisfied by the Robin
Hood Tax. The above findings of the Tribunal about the nature and characterization of
Claimants’ claim on the Robin Hood Tax (see §§ 547-553 above) are conclusively

determinative of this issue.

e. Classification of Photovoltaic Plants as Immovable Property

With respect to the (re)classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property,
Claimants primarily take issue with the Circular No. 36/E of the Italian Revenue Agency
dated 19 December 2013, but also more generally complain about the inconsistent
positions adopted by the Italian Revenue Agency and Cadastral/Land Agency prior to 2013
in this regard (see Section IV.F(5) above). In its jurisdictional objection under Article 21(1)
ECT, Respondent argues that Claimants guise their claims in these proceedings behind the
issue concerning the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property, but the
substance or “actual target” of their claims are the IMU and TASI Charges that are a

consequence of such classification. In essence, classification of a property as immovable

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

property allegedly subjects it to municipal charges on buildings and road maintenance
known as IMU and TASI Charges, respectively, which are not applicable for movable
property.

Thus, similar to the Robin Hood Tax, here too the principal dispute between the Parties on
the jurisdictional issue under Article 21(1) ECT pertains to the characterization of
Claimants’ claims, i.e., whether they pertain only to the classification of photovoltaic
plants as immovable property by the Italian Revenue Agency or in the process also
implicate and require a determination on certain taxation measures. In other words, none of
the Parties disputes that the IMU and TASI Charges qualify as taxation measures under the
criteria in Italian law enlisted in { 520 and/or under any other criterion that may be relevant
for the purposes of Article 21(7) ECT. In the course of their submissions, both Claimants
and Respondent refer to the IMU and TASI Charges as “taxes”.*” Accordingly, the
Tribunal’s findings below are limited to a determination of whether Claimants’ claims
pertaining to the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property, as
characterized by them, are implicitly claims relating to taxation measures that fall beyond

this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Based on a review of the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal considers that Respondent has
convincingly demonstrated that Claimants’ claims concerning the classification of
photovoltaic plants as immovable property are, in essence, claims relating to the
underlying taxation measures, i.e., the IMU and TASI Charges. In this regard, Respondent
correctly points out that the very nature of such a measure classifying any property as
movable or immovable property has the function of defining the scope of taxation (see J

479 above).

Therefore, notwithstanding Claimants’ characterization of their claims in their arguments
on jurisdiction, the Tribunal derives the real nature of Claimants’ claims from their
pleadings on the merits of the case. In these pleadings, Claimants themselves highlight that
the reason they object to the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property in

these proceedings relates directly to the imposition of the IMU and TASI Charges. In

See SoRy, | 148 where, with reference to the IMU and TASI Charges, Claimants clarify that they “are not

contesting the existence or application of those faxes” (emphasis added).

Claimants’ words, “[t]he characterization of photovoltaic plants is important, because
immovable and movable property are subject to different depreciation rates and thus
different effective tax rates, as well as different municipal charges.”°’! These municipal
charges constitute the IMU and TASI Charges.*”? From the following passage of
Claimants’ submissions, it is evident that while they present their claims as being against
only the “arbitrary and unfair” classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property,
at bottom, their complaint pertains to the fact that such a classification results in the
charging of unwarranted municipal charges:
The “consolidated” position from Italy’s fiscal authority in 2013 was clearly
arbitrary and unfair, as Claimants explained in their Statement of Claim. PV
facilities — which can comprise panels installed on a residential rooftop — are
clearly not themselves “immovable” real property that should be subject to
municipal charges for services normally due on such property, including road
maintenance and public lighting.”
Moreover, the fact that the IMU and TASI Charges lie at the centre of Claimants’ claims is
also reflected from the relief they request from this Tribunal in respect of this issue. While
Italy reversed the classification of photovoltaic plants in 2016, classifying them as movable
property again prospectively, Claimants take issue with the fact that the IMU and TASI
Charges they paid since 2013 until 2016 were neither offset nor credited by Italy or its
concerned authorities. Thus, Claimants’ request for damages from this Tribunal includes a
reimbursement of the IMU and TASI Charges that Claimants were charged from 2013 until
2016. In other words, Claimants’ requested relief from this Tribunal on this issue relates
only to these IMU and TASI Charges and does not relate to the classification of
photovoltaic plants as immovable property per se, which in Claimants’ own admission was
rightly reversed by Italy in 2016.°% This itself shows that Claimants’ claims on the

classification issue are directly related to these IMU and TASI Charges.

Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Claimants’ claim concerning the classification of the

photovoltaic plants as immovable property is a claim with respect to taxation measures,

ie., the IMU and TASI Charges. Consequently, Respondent’s jurisdictional objection

under Article 21(1) ECT succeeds, insofar as it concerns this claim.

Given that none of the Parties disputes that the IMU and TASI Charges are taxation
measures (see {[ 555 above), the Tribunal need not separately examine whether the specific
requirements for qualifying as a taxation measure under Article 21(7) ECT (see { 520
above) are satisfied by these Charges. The above findings of the Tribunal about the nature
and characterization of Claimants’ claim on the IMU and TASI Charges (see {J 556-560

above) are conclusively determinative of this issue.

f. Conclusion on Article 21 ECT

For the reasons discussed in the preceding sub-sections, the Tribunal concludes that
Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under Article 21(1) ECT succeeds in respect of
Claimants’ claims relating to the (i) Robin Hood Tax; and (ii) the classification of
photovoltaic plants as immovable property. Therefore, the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction over these matters. On the remaining aspects, i.e., (i) the Administrative
Management Fee; and (ii) the imbalance costs, Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under

Article 21(1) ECT fails, since these measures do not qualify as taxation measures.

(2) Exclusive Jurisdiction Clause in GSE Contracts

It is not disputed between the Parties that the GSE contracts were executed between GSE
on the one side and the SPVs acquired by the First, Second or Third Claimants on the other
side, as the case may be (see Section IV.E above). It is also not disputed between the
Parties that Article 9 of each of the seven GSE contracts under the Second Conto Energia
and Article 13 of the two GSE contracts under the Third Conto Energia relating to Rustico
and Milana Plants contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Court of

Rome, providing as follows:

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

For any dispute arising out of or in any way connected to the interpretation and

execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to therein, the Parties

agree on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Rome.*”>
The Tribunal notes that Respondent’s translation of the above exclusive jurisdiction clause
is at variance from Claimants’, inasmuch as Respondent’s translation of the first part of the
clause provides: “[flor any dispute arising out of, or in any way related to the interpretation
and/or execution of this Convention and the acts it refers to ...”>”° However, the Tribunal
also notes that throughout the Hearing, Respondent relied on Claimants’ translation of the
GSE contracts.*”” Accordingly, without prejudice to the accuracy of the Parties’ respective
translations, the Tribunal’s findings below shall also rely on Claimants’ translation of the
exclusive jurisdiction clause in the GSE contracts. In any event, the Tribunal considers that

its conclusions would not be any different if Respondent’s translation were to be used.

The disputed issues between the Parties pertain to (a) the fact that Claimants were not party
to the GSE contracts and the implications thereof; and (b) the nature of the claims brought
by Claimants before this Tribunal under Article 26 ECT. The Tribunal shall address these

disputed issues in turn below.

a. Implications of Claimants and Respondent not being party to
the GSE Contracts
In relation to item (a) in { 565 above, the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’ argument
that since Claimants were not party to any of the GSE contracts, the exclusive jurisdiction
clauses in question do not apply to them. In fact, given that Respondent was also not party
to any of the GSE contracts, the exclusive jurisdiction clauses do not apply to Respondent
either. Accordingly, these exclusive jurisdiction clauses could not be resorted to for
resolving any disputes between Claimants and Respondent. Instead, these clauses could

only be relied upon for disputes arising between GSE and whichever one of Claimants’

SPVs is a party to the relevant contract. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the presence of
the exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the GSE contracts does not per se inhibit this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to resolve the dispute between Claimants and Respondent, pursuant

to Article 26 ECT.

In this regard, Article 26(2)(b) ECT assumes relevance. The Tribunal agrees with
Respondent that this provision indicates that the ECT is agreeable to dispute resolution by
alternative methods of dispute resolution than international arbitration (see { 484 above).
However, Article 26(2)(b) ECT limits this alternative option to resolve disputes “in
accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure”. Given
that Claimants and Respondent were not parties to the GSE contracts, the exclusive
jurisdiction clauses therein are neither “applicable” between them, nor do they qualify as

“previously agreed” dispute settlement procedures under Article 26(2)(b) ECT.

Further, in respect of the case law relied upon by the Parties, the Tribunal notes, as rightly
pointed out by Claimants (see {| 498 above), that two of the three cases relied upon by
Respondent in support of its arguments were factually distinct from the present case. Those
cases, i.e., SGS v. Philippines and BIVAC v. Paraguay, involved contracts (containing
exclusive jurisdiction clauses) that were signed by the claimant(s) and the respondent-State
(or the concerned Ministry of the respondent-State) in those cases.*”* This, as mentioned in

{| 566 above, is not the situation in the present case.

The third case relied upon by Respondent, i.e., Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia, saw the
tribunal denying respondent-State’s jurisdictional objection, while recognizing that “in
order for the [Concession] raised by the Respondent to be in conflict with this Tribunal’s
exercise of jurisdiction, that [Concession] must both deal with the same matters and
Parties”.5”? Along the same lines, most recently, in Greentech v. Italy, which Claimants

correctly point out was a case factually close to the present case (see {| 498 above), the

tribunal rejected a similar jurisdictional objection on the ground that claimants there were

not party to the GSE contracts.**°

Accordingly, case law confirms this Tribunal’s understanding that the exclusive
jurisdiction clauses in the GSE contracts do not inhibit this Tribunal’s jurisdiction under
the ECT, since the GSE contracts were not signed and executed between Claimants and
Respondent (see {| 566 above). The Tribunal’s understanding is not affected by
Respondent’s attempt to distinguish between the ECT and the GSE contracts on the ground
that the GSE contracts were specifically negotiated documents and would prevail over the
generic expression of consent in the ECT, pursuant to the doctrine of generalia specialibus
non derogant (see J 484 above). Notwithstanding the merit of this argument, the fact that
the GSE contracts were specifically negotiated between the parties to those contracts does
not vest any procedural right or obligation upon entities that were not parties to those
contract, such as Claimants or Respondent, to resolve disputes between them under the

contractual exclusive jurisdiction clauses.

b. The Nature of the Claims brought by Claimants before this
Tribunal
In relation to item (b) in { 565 above, i.e., the nature of the claims brought by Claimants
before this Tribunal under Article 26 ECT, the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’
submission that they are not seeking a resolution of a breach of contract claim in these
ECT proceedings. In fact, Respondent does not directly contest that Claimants’ allegations
in these proceedings do not relate to a breach of the GSE contracts. Instead, Respondent’s
submission is that the claims that Claimants are raising in these proceedings, pertaining to
the incentives received by investors under the Conto Energia Decrees, are also covered by
the broadly worded exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the GSE. This overlap, as per
Respondent, renders Claimants’ treaty claims in these proceedings beyond this Tribunal’s

jurisdiction and/or inadmissible (see { 482 above).

There is no doubt that since Claimants are not party to the GSE contracts, they cannot

claim a breach of those contracts before this Tribunal. Indeed, the Tribunal need not go any

further in its considerations on this issue. However, for the sake of completeness, the
Tribunal shall briefly address Respondent’s submission relating to the potential overlap
between the scope of the present dispute and a theoretical dispute that can be initiated

under the exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the GSE contracts.

573. In this regard, the Tribunal is mindful that the same set of facts and circumstances can
simultaneously give rise to claims for breach of municipal law brought before national
courts and claims for breach of a treaty brought before an international tribunal. However,
with respect to this potential overlap of claims, the Tribunal agrees with findings of the ad
hoc annulment committee in Vivendi I v. Argentina and the other awards and decisions
relied upon by Claimants. In each of these cases, it was found that when the “essential” or
“fundamental basis of a claim” is a breach of a treaty, an international tribunal constituted
under that treaty can exercise its jurisdiction over such a claim.**! Even the cases relied

upon by Respondent agree with this general principle.**”

574. In the instant case, Claimants’ claims, while touching upon the GSE contracts, in reality
deal with a number of other factual and regulatory aspects beyond those contracts. To
name a few, Claimants’ claims under Article 10(1) ECT deal with aspects such as the
alleged application of Administrative Management Fee to photovoltaic plants, the alleged
imposition of “imbalance costs” on photovoltaic plants, and the alleged remodulation of

the entire Conto Energia framework with the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

575. Therefore, it is apparent that Claimants’ claims in these proceedings address a number of
Respondent’s alleged actions or inactions going beyond the GSE contracts, and present
them as violations of Respondent’s international obligations under Article 10(1) ECT. In

other words, Claimants’ claims trigger Respondent’s obligations under international law.

These claims do not require this Tribunal to make a finding regarding either a breach of the
GSE contracts, not least because Claimants or Respondent are not parties to them, or a
violation of Italian law. Thus, the Tribunal considers that the claims that are at issue in
these proceedings are fundamentally and essentially in the nature of breach of treaty
claims, i.e., claims that implicate an alleged breach of treaty obligations, particularly those

under Article 10(1) ECT.

The fact that the factual context behind some or all of these claims may also theoretically
be presented before the Court of Rome under the exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the GSE
contracts does not come in the way of the existence or the exercise of this Tribunal’s
jurisdictions over Claimants’ claims in these proceedings. In this connection, the Tribunal

583

agrees with the findings of various tribunals, relied on by Claimants,°’’ and in particular

the following extract from the award in Crystallex v. Venezuela:
As explained in Vivendi I, the same set of facts can give rise to different claims
grounded on differing legal orders, i.e. the municipal and the international legal
orders. However, an exclusive jurisdiction clause in relation to disputes
concerning possible contractual breaches, such as Clause 19 of the MOC, may
not divest an international tribunal of its jurisdiction under an international
treaty in relation to possible treaty breaches.*** (emphasis in the original)
The above considerations apply equally to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and the
admissibility of Claimants’ claims. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the presence of
the exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the GSE contracts does not take away this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT, nor does it render Claimants’ claims under the ECT

inadmissible. Therefore, Respondent’s objections to this end are rejected.

(3) The Requirement of Amicable Settlement under Article 26(1) ECT

This jurisdictional objection, which Respondent also raises as a challenge to the
admissibility of Claimants’ claims, relates to the requirement of amicable settlement of the
disputes prior to the initiation of the arbitration proceedings. This requirement emanates

from Articles 26(1) and 26(2) ECT (quoted in {| 287 above), which provide that disputes

between the investor(s) and the State concerning an alleged breach of an obligation of the
former under Part III “shall, if possible, be settled amicably”, and if the disputes “cannot be
settled [amicably] within a period of three months from the date on which either party to
the dispute requested amicable settlement”, the investor(s) may choose to initiate

arbitration.

From the aforementioned regime, three conditions are required to be met for this
requirement of amicable settlement to be satisfied: (i) there shall be an attempt to settle the
disputes amicably; (ii) the disputes for which amicable settlement is sought are the disputes
ultimately referred to arbitration; and (iii) arbitration cannot be initiated until three months
have expired from the date on which the request for amicable settlement was provided by

any of the disputing parties. Each of these conditions appears to be mandatory in nature.

Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections do not dispute that the first and the

third of the above three conditions were satisfied.

Claimants sent a “Notice of Legal Dispute Arising under the Energy Charter Treat and
Offer of Amicable Settlement” on 4 May 2016 to various Ministries of the Italian
Republic.*** Respondent does not dispute that this notice qualified as an attempt to settle
the disputes amicably (see { 486 above). Further, Claimants filed their RfA on 26 August
2016 (see { 7 above), which was more than three months expired since the letter of 4 May
2016 was sent to Respondent. Thus, there is no dispute that the third condition enlisted in

579 above was also satisfied.

Respondent objects to the satisfaction of the second requirement enlisted in { 579 above.
Specifically, as per Respondent, Claimants raised two new claims in these arbitration
proceedings, which were not mentioned in Claimants’ letter of 4 May 2016 to Italy. The
new claims that Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections pertain to are the
claims relating to (i) the ex nunc application of the Constitutional Court Decision No.
10/2015 relating to the Robin Hood Tax, and Italy’s failure to reimburse the taxes wrongly
imposed; and (ii) Italy’s failure to reimburse or offset payments made by Claimants as a

result of the wrongful classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property (the

IMU and TASI Charges). For these two claims, due to the incongruity between Claimants’
letter of 4 May 2016 and its subsequent submissions in these arbitration proceedings,
Respondent submits that the requirement of amicable settlement under Article 26 ECT has

not been satisfied (see {| 487 above).

However, the Tribunal has already found in Section VII.D(1) above that it does not have
jurisdiction over the aforementioned two claims, since they qualify as “taxation measures”
under Article 21 ECT (see {{[ 553 and 560 specifically). Having already denied jurisdiction
over these two claims on other grounds, the Tribunal no longer considers it appropriate or
necessary to examine Respondent’s additional jurisdictional and admissibility objections
pertaining to the requirement of amicable settlement. Specifically, it is no longer required
to compare the scope of Claimants’ letter of 4 May 2016 with its submissions in these
arbitration proceedings to determine whether the second requirement enlisted in { 579
above was satisfied for these two claims. Accordingly, this issue is rendered moot by the

Tribunal’s previous findings.

(4) Conclusion on Other Issues of Jurisdiction and Admissibility

In light of the reasons discussed in the preceding Sections, the Tribunal concludes that
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and its objections relating to the admissibility of
Claimants’ claims must be rejected, except in respect of Claimants’ claims relating to the
(i) Robin Hood Tax; and (ii) the classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable
property. These two issues fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction for being “taxation
measures” under Article 21 ECT. The remainder of the disputed issues between the Parties
fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and Claimants’ claims in those respects are not

inadmissible.

RESPONDENT’S BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ECT OR
INTERNATIONAL LAW

Claimants allege that Respondent breached its obligations under Article 10(1) ECT on
three counts. First, Claimants allege that Respondent failed to accord to its investments fair

and equitable treatment, as per the first and second sentences of Article 10(1) ECT.

Second, Claimants allege that Respondent impaired Claimants’ investments through
unreasonable and discriminatory measures, and thereby breached the so-called
“impairment clause” in the third sentence of Article 10(1) ECT. Third, Claimants claim
that Italy failed to observe all its obligations entered into with respect to Claimants’
investments, and thereby breached the so-called “Umbrella Clause” or “observance of

undertakings” clause in the fifth sentence of Article 10(1) ECT.

The Tribunal shall first reproduce the Parties’ submissions on these three allegations in

turn, following which it shall lay down its considerations on each of them.

RELEVANT TREATY PROVISIONS
Article 10(1) ECT provides as follows:
Article 10: Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments

(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments
in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all
times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and
equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair
by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such
Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by
international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party
shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.

ARTICLE 10(1) ECT: FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

(1) Claimants’ Position

According to Claimants, Respondent has violated its obligation to provide fair and
equitable treatment (“FET”) to Claimants’ investment in the following three distinct ways:
(i) by undermining Claimants’ legitimate expectation of predictable and stable support for

their photovoltaic facilities; (ii) by failing to treat Claimants’ investments transparently and

consistently; and (iii) by failing to act in good faith towards Claimants and their

investments.>*°

a. The Legal Standard

Claimants contend that the FET standard is to be applied in accordance with the treaty’s
object and purpose. In this connection, Claimants submit that the “fundamental aim” of the
ECT is “to strengthen the rule of law on energy issues”, and in turn to catalyse economic
growth by promoting long-term cooperation. Claimants further contend that the ECT
Contracting Parties accepted limitations on their power to alter the legislative or regulatory
framework governing an investment when their acts have given rise to legitimate

expectations of stability on the part of foreign investors.

Further, Claimants do not endorse the view that the FET standard requires a fundamental
or radical change in the regulatory regime, or that the host State’s conduct should be
manifestly unfair or unreasonable.**’ In this regard, they also dispute the articulation of the
FET legal standard by the tribunal in AES v. Hungary, characterizing it as an “outlier” for
being closer to the customary international law minimum standard, which is not applicable

under Article 10(1) ECT.**8

(i) | Legitimate Expectations
Claimants contend that the protection of legitimate expectations is one of the “major
components” of the FET standard.>*
According to Claimants, such legitimate expectations can be created through, both, explicit

and implicit promises, assurances or guarantees, and even by the overall circumstances

surrounding an investment. In this regard, Claimants rely on investment arbitration case
law, particularly the Parkerings v. Lithuania and Total v. Argentina cases, to contend that
explicit promises of the host State include: (i) the legal framework of the host State at the
time the investor made its investment; (ii) contractual undertakings by the host State; (iii)
public statement or declarations by the host State; and (iv) State conduct and policy goals.
The key question, as per Claimants, is whether the host State through any of the above

forms of conduct as induced investments.>””

593. Claimants also contend that it is only in the absence of specific promises in contracts or
otherwise that the investors’ alleged expectations are required to be balanced against the
host State’s regulatory authority. On this basis, Claimants seek to distinguish the various
cases relied upon by Respondent and the cases relating to the Spanish renewable energy
framework, on the ground that none of those cases involved specific commitments, either

by way of a contract or otherwise, regarding the investments in question, as the present

case allegedly does. *?!

594. For Claimants, legitimate expectations do not, however, indispensably require specific
representations or guarantees from the host State. Such expectations can be inferred from

595. Furthermore, while Claimants admit the broad proposition that investors’ legitimate
expectations should be assessed at the time of investment, they submit that limiting the
investors’ legitimate expectations only to rights that have been “crystallised” at the time of
the investment would be inappropriate. According to Claimants, investment arbitration
case law recognizes that an examination of investors’ legitimate expectations is to be
grounded on the overall legal order or conditions offered by the host State, and need not
focus on rights, contractual or otherwise, that have been formally crystallized at the date of
the investment. Accordingly, legitimate expectations arising after the date of the
investment, in the form of crystallized rights have also been respected by arbitral
tribunals.** Moreover, as per Claimants, such a limitation to crystallized rights would
create a distinction between investors in development projects and subsequent acquirers of
the same projects, which distinction would be inconsistent with the ECT, transparency and
economic rationality"? Thus, Claimants’ contention is that even absent the crystallised
contractual rights, statutory regulatory frameworks can also create legitimate

expectations.*>

process, and not as a one-stop occurrence. To this end, Claimants rely on the broad
definition of “Investment” in the ECT (including the definition of “making of investments”
in Article 1(8) ECT), and submit that the investment is a complex process involving
multiple steps that must be viewed as part of an integrated whole.*®° Further, they also

of any ambiguity, i.e., it, inter alia, requires (i) the legal framework for the investor’s

clarify uncertainties that develop in a regime; (iii) the State to adequately inform investors

(iii) Good Faith
599. Regarding the good faith obligation of a State under the FET standard, Claimants contend
that it entails “a sincere intention to deal fairly with others”. Claimants rely on investment
arbitration case law to contend that the duty of good faith includes a duty to treat investors
in an “even-handed and non-discriminatory” manner. Further, as per Claimants, reliance on
internal structure to excuse non-compliance with contractual obligations could also amount
to a violation of good faith. In this connection, Claimants contend that the FET standard
“imposes obligations beyond customary international requirements of good faith

treatment”.©?

Respondent’s policy goals, which as per Claimants, created reasonable expectations
of stability. According to Claimants, the fundamental purpose of Respondent’s
support framework was to encourage substantial investment in the photovoltaic
sector and ensure that Respondent would meet binding EU targets for renewable

energy;°?

The five Conto Energia Decrees enacted by Respondent from 2005 to 2012,
containing explicit promises to investors that the support that they would receive
through the Conto Energia incentives and other elements of the regime would remain

constant for 20 years;

GSE’s tariff confirmation letters and the GSE contracts entered into with respect to
each photovoltaic plant receiving the tariffs, which expressly confirmed that the tariff
rate granted to a particular facility would be applicable for a period of 20 years.
Claimants submit that the Conto Energia Decrees themselves did not automatically
convey a specific right on any particular investor. Rather, according to Claimants, the
specific rights emanated from tariff confirmation letters sent by GSE confirming the
operator’s right to receive tariff at a fixed rate for 20 years, and subsequently, from
the “contractual relationship” with the GSE that was created by contracts entered into
with the plant operators. Claimants rely on the opinion of their expert, Professor
Antonio D’Atena to contend that the GSE contracts were “individual and actual
measures”, on which investors’ “legitimate expectations” of fixed tariffs for 20 years

were based;°*

The numerous public statements made by Respondent’s officials confirming the
stability of the incentive rates and their fixed 20 year duration, specifically, the

statements of the Italian Minister of Environment confirming that “the system

(v) The confirmation by Respondent’s agencies at every level of the Government,
including the Ministries of Environment and Economic Development, the Italian
Electrical Energy Authority, as well as municipal, provincial, and regional
authorities, and even the GSE, regarding the fundamental aspects of constant tariff

rates and fixed duration of the Conto Energia regime to investors.°°°

Claimants contend that Respondent’s (i) explicit promises of fixed incentive tariff to be
paid for a duration of 20 years; (ii) policy goals of encouraging photovoltaic investment
and ensuring that the photovoltaic facilities would be competitive with other types of
electricity producers in the State; and (iii) requirement to meet its domestic and

international energy target, formed the basis for Claimants’ investment in Italy.°”

Claimants further dispute Respondent’s assertion that no legitimate expectation regarding a
fixed tariff rate for a 20 year period can be derived from the Conto Energia Decrees as the
underlying legislative framework surrounding the Decrees only promised investors a “fair
return” on their investment. Claimants contend that the underlying legislative framework to
the Conto Energia Decrees, namely, Legislative Decrees 387/2003 and the Romani Decree
explicitly instructed the relevant Ministries to establish specific rates for various types of
facilities, which according to Claimants, was done in the Conto Energia Decrees.
Claimants submit that these Legislative Decrees promised fair remuneration to investors,

which Respondent incorrectly interprets to mean “fair return”.°°?

Although Claimants began investing in Italy before many of their plants formally received
the GSE letters or contracts, Claimants submit that this fact should not impact the
Tribunal’s determinations on Claimants’ legitimate expectations from a factual or legal
standpoint. These determinations should be common for all of Claimants’ photovoltaic

plants, regardless of the timing of investment in each of them.*!°

According to Claimants, even though Italy’s offer to grant incentive tariffs had not yet
crystallized into enforceable rights for some of the plants that Claimants invested in,
Claimants’ reliance on the conditions offered by Italy when they acquired their shares for
these plants should nonetheless be protected as legitimate expectations. These conditions
offered by Respondent entailed the performance of subsequent acts by Respondent that
would eventually entitle all of Claimants’ plants to receive the tariffs upon entry into
operation. Claimants also dispute, from a legal and factual standpoint, Respondent’s
submission that there was no discussion between Italian authorities and Claimants for their
individual investments, and thus, there could be no specific undertaking or promises that

Italian authorities made to Claimants (see J 641 below).°!!

Claimants, in any event, submit that the effective date when the tariff rights crystallised for
each of Claimants’ plants was the date of entry into operation of the concerned plant. That
is how the “effective date” of the GSE contracts was stipulated, and consequently the GSE
contracts executed after a plant’s entry into operation backdated the payment of tariffs to
the effective date. As part of this “integrated and sequential” regulatory framework,
Claimants characterise the delay between the entry into operation of a plant and the receipt
of the tariff confirmation letters or the GSE contracts as “bureaucratic delay” that had no

material impact on tariff payments.°!?

Furthermore, Claimants also submit that the relevant time of investment in the present case
should be considered as the time when each plant’s tariff rights crystallized and not the
time of the share acquisition. In the present case, Claimants’ investments, in their
submission, comprise, inter alia, (i) their shares in the companies or SPVs operating the
photovoltaic plants; (ii) those companies’ claims to money pursuant to the Conto Energia
regime; and (iii) their claims to performance pursuant to the GSE contracts. Claimants also
support their submission in this regard by emphasising that the Framework Agreement,
which was the basis for Claimants’ parent joint venture (see J 184-185 above), envisaged
the investments to be structured such that the payments would be made in a stage-wise
manner in three milestones. Since the majority of the payments were reserved until after
the plants would enter into operation, the time of the share acquisition would not function
as the relevant time of investment in this case. Instead, the most relevant time for

considering would be the time for entry into operation of each plant.°!?

Moreover, Claimants dispute Respondent’s submission that Claimants did not exercise

suffi

  

ient due diligence prior to investing in the Italian photovoltaic market, on the grounds
that reasonable due diligence suffices to meet the standard of due diligence required, and
that Respondent has not been able to establish that such reasonable due diligence would
have revealed the possibility regulatory change of which Claimants complain in these
proceedings. As per Claimants, the due diligence they conducted prior to investing “far
exceeds” the standard of reasonability (see, in this regard, Sections IV.E(2) and IV.E(3)

above).°!4

measures: (i) the imposition of the retroactive Administrative Management Fee on all
existing photovoltaic facilities through the enactment of the Fifth Conto Energia Decree
(see Section IV.F(1) above); (ii) the creation of a requirement for photovoltaic producers to
pay “imbalance costs” (see Section IV.F(3) above); and (iii) the enactment of the Spalma-
incentivi Decree which forced Claimants to accept a reduction of the tariff rates granted

under the Conto Energia regime (see Section IV.G above).°!

Claimants contend that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was the “most egregious measure”
carried out by Respondent against the photovoltaic investors, as it both reduced and
delayed, retroactively, the constant tariffs that Respondent had generated to photovoltaic
investors under the five successive Conto Energia Decrees for a fixed period of 20
years.°!® Claimants dispute Respondent’s assertion that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was
not a retroactive measure because it only reduced tariffs to be paid in the future. Claimants
maintain that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was tantamount to a retroactive modification of
the incentive framework that Respondent guaranteed to investors, because Respondent
applied it to facilities that were already operating after substantial fixed costs had been
invested and for which Respondent had promised payment of specific tariff rates over a
period of 20 years to induce those upfront investments. In this connection, Claimants point
out that several Italian senators, including Senator Arrigioni and Senator Piccolo, the UK
ambassador Christopher Prentice, the EC and the European Parliament have recognized the

Spalma-incentivi Decree to be retroactive in nature.°!”

Claimants dispute Respondent’s assertion that they were earning excessive returns on their
investment or that the Spalma-incentivi Decree only had a minimal impact on Claimants
and their investments, and not a radical or fundamental one. Claimants rely on the opinion

of their expert, FTI Consulting, to contend that they suffered a loss of EUR 28 million

approximately on account of the Spalma-incentivi Decree alone. In this regard, Claimants

also rely on the testimony of their witnesses, Mr. Florian and Mr. Blum.°!®

Claimants reject Respondent’s argument that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was necessary
due to the increased monetary burden on consumers attributable to the photovoltaic support
costs. Claimants further argue that such increased expenditure for the consumers had been
foreseen and factored in by Respondent at the time of implementing the Conto Energia

regime.°!?

Claimants disagree that the alleged options offered by Respondent to photovoltaic
producers at the time of implementation of the Spalma-incentivi Decree made the
enactment of the Decree reasonable or proportional. Claimants also dispute the existence
and efficacy of the alleged safeguard measures built in the Spalma-incentivi to assist

photovoltaic investors.?°

With respect to the Italian Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 upholding the
legitimacy of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see Section IV.G(2) above), Claimants contend
that the Decision was not a “firm” or conclusive determination of the constitutionality of
the Spalma-incentivi Decree. Claimants rely on Professor D’Atena’s opinion to contend
that the Constitutional Court Decision is a sentenza di rigetto or decision to dismiss,
meaning that “Italian judges were not bound to follow it”. Claimants further contend that
Respondent’s reliance of this Decision was inappropriate as Italian law is not the law
governing the present dispute. Similarly, Claimants consider Respondent’s assertions
regarding the Salva Alcoa Decree being an unexpected benefit for Claimants as being

factually and contextually incorrect.*?!

Claimants contend that Respondent’s reliance on the Blusun v. Italy tribunal’s decision is
misplaced as that case did not concern the Spalma-incentivi Decree. Rather it concerned

the Romani Decree, which, according to Claimants, unlike the Spalma-incentivi Decree,

did not abolish incentives for which plant operators had already qualified.°” Similarly,

Claimants also attempt to factually distinguish the Antaris v. Czech Republic case.°?

Other Legitimate Expectations and their Frustration by Italy

In addition to their alleged expectations regarding the stability and duration of the Conto
Energia regime, Claimants challenge the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolution
618/2013 fixing the minimum guaranteed price for 2014 at EUR 38.9/MWh as being
violative of Claimants’ legitimate expectations (see Section IV.F(2) above). Claimants
contend that they had legitimate expectations regarding the availability of minimum

guaranteed prices in the off-take regime, based, inter alia, on Resolution 280/2007.°4

As per Claimants, Resolution 280/2007 had advocated the policy goal of establishing
minimum guaranteed prices to ensure the “economic survival” of photovoltaic facilities
under 1 MW, notwithstanding market conditions, thereby creating a legitimate expectation
for Claimants that the minimum guaranteed prices would remain available and above a
certain competitive threshold. Claimants argue that their expectations, in this regard, were
also strengthened by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s practice of fixing the
minimum guaranteed price between EUR 72/MWh and EUR 106/MWh for a period of six
years. In this regard, Claimants dispute Respondent’s assertions that there was a reduction
in the operating costs of the plant operator, which justified the reduction of minimum

guaranteed prices as being factually incorrect and unproven.*°

Moreover, Claimants also argue that the imposition of the Administrative Management Fee
and the imbalance costs on Claimants’ plants constituted another violation of their
legitimate expectations, since these costs, in essence, altered the promise of fixed

tariffs for twenty years.°7°

Claimants maintain that Respondent’s aforementioned measures are invalid under

international law. In this regard, Claimants (i) dispute Respondent’s argument that the

measures were valid in view of the regulatory public policy powers of the State, since such
powers are limited by a State’s international legal obligations and commitments towards
investors; (ii) challenge the relevance of the arbitral decisions relied upon by Respondent
in support of its assertion, since in none of those cases did the State make specific promises
or commitments to the investors; and (iii) contest Respondent’s entitlement to rely on the

“necessity” defence under international law.°”’

(ii) Transparency and Consistency
In addition to its arguments relating to legitimate expectations, Claimants contend that
Respondent’s conduct of (i) retroactively applying an Administrative Management Fee to
all photovoltaic plants; (ii) imposing “imbalance costs”; and (iii) “remodulation” of the
entire Conto Energia framework with the Spalma-incentivi Decree, was inconsistent with
the framework established under the Conto Energia Decrees, which should have governed
Claimants’ facilities for 20 years. On this basis, Claimants contend that Respondent
repeatedly violated its duty to provide transparent and consistent conditions for Claimants’

investments in the Respondent State.°*

Claimants contend that Respondent replaced what was once a stable, transparent regime
with uncertainty that undermined the economic predictions that had Claimants made when
deciding to invest. According to Claimants, the Spalma-incentivi in particular, made the
investment environment in the Respondent State impossible to predict, because investors
could no longer rely in future on the legal framework that was to govern their facilities for

more than a decade.”

Claimants further contend that the drastic reduction of the minimum guaranteed prices to
EUR 38.9 EUR/MWh was also inconsistent, in light of the Italian Electrical Energy
Authority’s past practice (see | 617 above).°°°

(iii) Good faith
Claimants contend that Respondent reneged on its commitments to Claimants in bad faith.
Claimants argue that Respondent’s decision to reap the full benefits of the photovoltaic
plants and the energy capacity that Claimants developed and in which they invested, while
denying Claimants the full, originally-promised support scheme that induced those
investments, was not in good faith. Claimants challenge Respondent’s purported political
justification for the retroactive “redistribution” of Conto Energia incentives, namely, to
bring down the costs of electricity bills for end-consumers, as being in bad faith and an
excuse for unilaterally abrogating the support framework or breaching the contracts plant

operators had with GSE.®*!

In this regard, Claimants contend that several members of parliament, recognized that the
Spalma-incentivi Decree was “retroactive, discriminatory, and likely to be challenged as it
violates essentially the certainty of international and national law”.°? According to
Claimants, the Spalma-incentivi Decree, in fact, targeted the photovoltaic sector. Claimants
argue that the Spalma-incentivi Decree produced no meaningful savings and, therefore, its
alleged end did not justify the means undertaken by Respondent to achieve that end.°?
Claimants further contend that the imposition of the Administrative Management Fee and

the imbalance costs was also in bad faith.°*

(2) Respondent’s Position
a. The Legal Standard

Respondent contends that Article 10(1) of the ECT does not define FET and, therefore,
reliance must be placed on customary law principles to determine the meaning and scope
of the FET standard under the ECT. Respondent contends that the meaning of FET under
the ECT is to be derived from the practices developed in the field of international treatment

of foreign investments and from the application of general principles of international law.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

According to Respondent, the FET standard should be understood as a sort of general
clause, having a composite meaning and operating in continuous evolution, according to

general principles such as good faith and proportionality.°*°

626. Further, as per Respondent, only manifestly unfair, unreasonable or inequitable regulatory
modifications can create a breach of the FET standard, such that these regulatory
modifications cause a disruptive change to the investments.**°

(i) Legitimate Expectations
627. Respondent agrees with Claimants that the protection of legitimate expectations of an
investor is an element of the host State’s FET obligation. However, it disputes the “latitude

and scope” of legitimate expectations proposed by Claimants.**”

628. Respondent emphasizes that the legitimacy of the investors’ expectations is the qualifying
condition for protection to be offered under the FET standard. According to Respondent,
the legitimacy of investors’ expectations must be assessed by taking into account and
balancing the positions of, both, the foreign investor and the host State, by giving due
relevance to the right of States to enact their legislations pursuant to their regulatory

powers.°8

629. Respondent’s position is that this consideration of the overall circumstances implies that
the FET standard under Article 10(1) ECT cannot be equated to a stabilization or freezing
clause. In this connection, Respondent relies, inter alia, on the arbitral tribunal decisions in

Blusun v. Italy and Belenergia v. Italy, which according to Respondent, confirm that the
legal standard for legitimate expectations may not be interpreted as requiring the host State
to freeze its regulatory activity. Instead, it requires tribunals to take into account factors
such as reasonableness, proportionality and public interest while making its determinations
of investors’ legitimate expectations. In support of this proposition, Respondent also relies

on Italian law, specifically the Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017.°?

630. Amongst the various factors to be considered, Respondent also emphasises the importance
of due diligence to be conducted by prudent investors before investing in any regime that is

prone to regulatory changes, which the Italian renewable energy market allegedly was.™°

631.

Another factor that Respondent highlights is the timing of the investment in consideration.
With respect to the investors’ expectations, Respondent contends that the protection
offered under the FET standard is limited to those expectations of the investors that existed
at the time when they made their investment. In this regard, the relevant time of making of

the investment, in Respondent’s view, is when the investor acquired the relevant assets or a

controlling stake thereof.°*!

632. Further, it is Respondent’s position that in the absence of a specific commitment to
investors such as a stabilization clause, changes to regulatory framework established by
means of general legislation do not qualify as a breach of legitimate expectations. Along
these lines, Respondent attempts to distinguish the Spanish laws that promised incentives

to investors from the Italian regime in this regard, since the former contained stabilization

clauses and also, on certain occasions, involved specific assurances given by Spanish

authorities in discussions or meetings held with investors.“

Moreover, while Respondent acknowledges that a State’s regulatory powers cannot protect
any and all modifications made by the State to its legal regime, according to Respondent,
such regulatory powers do preserve a State’s authority to fairly, equitably and reasonably

modify its legislative regimes.

(ii) Transparency and Consistency
Respondent disputes that a State’s duty to assure transparency and/or consistency is an
autonomous obligation of the host State under its FET obligations. For Respondent, the
State’s duty to maintain stability and/or consistency forms a part of its duty to protect the
legitimate expectations of the investor, whereas the State’s duty to maintain transparency is
part of the general standard of FET. Accordingly, Respondent disputes that there is a
relation between consistency and transparency, on the basis of which Claimants have put
forth an autonomous argument under the FET standard. According to Respondent, the case

law relied upon by Claimants does not support their assertions in this regard.°*

(iii) Good Faith
Respondent disagrees with Claimants that good faith constitutes an autonomous category
of a State’s FET obligations. For Respondent, the principle of good faith along with the
principle of proportionality, are essential to correctly interpret and apply the FET standard

and are not autonomous categories of the FET standard.

According to Respondent, the very concept of “fairness” that qualifies FET is an

expression of good faith. Further, “reasonableness” as a parameter to assess the legitimacy

of the host State’s conduct is in turn a fundamental expression of good faith. On this basis,
Respondent contends that good faith cannot be considered as an autonomous obligation

under the FET standard, distinct from a State’s other obligations under FET standard.©°

b. __ Italy’s Alleged Breach of the FET Standard

(i) Legitimate Expectations
Respondent disputes that Claimants could have any legitimate expectations based on the
overall legal regime in Italy, and in particular the Conto Energia Decrees or the GSE

letters and contracts that followed.
Lack of any Basis for Claimants’ Legiti Expectations

At the outset, Respondent disputes that the GSE contracts relied upon by Claimants, can
constitute a basis for Claimants’ FET claims. In the alternative to its jurisdictional and/or
inadmissibility objection in this regard (see Section VII.C(2)b above), Respondent
contends that the nature of the GSE contracts precludes it from forming a basis for
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations. According to Respondent, the GSE contracts
are “accessory contracts” to public acts. GSE did not have any autonomy in signing those
contracts as their essential elements were pre-determined by regulatory acts, specifically
the applicable Conto Energia Decrees. GSE was only administering the implementation of
these legislative mechanisms and had a purely executory role, and despite being a public
limited company was a body governed by public law. In support of this contention,
Respondent also submits that the incentives being disbursed by GSE did not originate from
money owed by GSE, but instead originated from public funds, specifically the A3
component of the consumers’ electricity bills (see § 165 above). Thus, Respondent
contends that such contracts entered into by GSE for broader public interest, in themselves,
cannot form the basis of the investors’ legitimate expectations as their role was exclusively
to support and confirm what has resulted from the Italy’s public acts, and to regulate the

modalities of these legislative acts.°”

Regarding Claimants’ other alleged bases for their legitimate expectations, namely, (i) the
overall legal environment in Italy supporting the photovoltaic sector; (ii) public statements
by politicians and authorities in the Respondent State regarding Respondent’s policy goals;
and (iii) Conta Energia Decrees, Respondent contends that these factors, at best, could
only create a reasonable expectation of stability of the system as a whole, and of the fact
that specific measures would be apt always to guarantee a “fair return”. Respondent,
however, disputes that Claimants could have a legitimate expectation that the specific
incentives granted by Respondent would be ironclad (in the nature of a stabilization

clause).°48

In this regard, Respondent contends that the Conto Energia Decrees were secondary rules,
which were to be interpreted and applied according to the principles and standards set forth
in the “hierarchically superordinate” Legislative Decrees 387/2003 (see {| 112-116 above)
and the Romani Decree (see {J 147-152 above), and the EC Directives they

implemented.™?

Along the same lines, Italy also highlights the lack of any specific assurances given to
Claimants, the absence of any specific discussions with Claimants or their SPVs and the
fact that the entire incentive tariffs regime was directed towards investors in general, and
not towards specific investors. Thus, Respondent disputes Claimants’ reliance on the
public statements and presentations made by the Italian authorities, since they were only

intended to repeat what was already mentioned in the Conto Energia Decrees.”

The Relevant Point in Time to examine Claimants’ alleged Legitimate Expectations

Respondent submits that the point in time in reference to which the existence of Claimants’
alleged legitimate expectations should be examined is the time of making the investment.

In the present case, that point in time, in Respondent’s view, is when the investor acquired

the relevant assets or a controlling stake thereof, which for Claimants happened when they

invested 80% of their money upfront.**!

Accordingly, Respondent disputes the existence of any of Claimants’ alleged legitimate
expectations on the basis of the GSE tariff confirmation letters and/or the GSE contracts,
since for eight out of the nine power plants Claimants had made the majority of their
investments prior to receiving these letters and/or contracts from GSE. Thus, Claimants
could not rely upon these letters and/or contracts for their alleged legitimate expectations
while investing in the Italian renewable energy market. For the only photovoltaic plant
wherein Claimants invested after having received the GSE tariff confirmation letter, i.e.,
Fiumicino, Respondent argues that the said letter was only an administrative letter that

could not by itself create any guarantee of non-modifiability of tariffs.°?

Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations were not frustrated by Italy’s Subsequent Conduct

      

Under the assumption that Claimants did have any legitimate expectations, Respondent
also makes the following arguments to submit that none of the Italian measures in issue

breached or violated such legitimate expectations:

Administrative Management Fee: For the Administrative Management Fee, Respondent
submits that the same did not affect Claimants’ expectations regarding the subsistence of
the Conto Energia regime. Rather, according to Respondent, the scope and ratio of such
measure was completely outside Claimants’ alleged expectations regarding the payment of

Conto Energia tariffs.°*

Respondent maintains that the imposition of the Administrative Management Fee was
aimed at compensating the management, verification, and control charges made by the
GSE. Respondent disputes that Claimants’ investments were harmed by the imposition of

the Administrative Management Fee, since the cost of the fee was very limited,

corresponding to Euros 0.0005/kWh, which is 0.15% of the average of the incentive tariffs

enjoyed by Claimants.°*

Further, Respondent submits that if Claimants’ contentions were to be upheld, it would be
tantamount to imposing a double chilling effect on the earlier photovoltaic regulations as
(i) incentive regimes would be unmodifiable; and (ii) such non-modifiability would extend
to any measure which might have a negative impact on investors’ interests arising from the

incentive schemes.°°

Imbalance Costs:

 

Respondent contends that the re-allocation of imbalance costs to
renewable energy suppliers by Respondent is completely unrelated to Claimants’ alleged
expectation that the incentive tariffs would be frozen for a period of 20 years. Respondent
argues that costs and tariffs are two separate factors, and, therefore, only if the costs
imposed were fictitious in nature, which Respondent contends is not the case here, could

the re-allocation of imbalance costs qualify as a disguised reduction of the tariffs.°°

Respondent submits that there is no dispute between the Parties that national authorities
have the discretionary power to decide whether such costs should be borne by consumers
or producers, according to the outcomes of their energy policies. On this basis, Respondent
contends that Claimants could not have had a reasonable expectation, nor were they
specifically assured, that such costs would have indefinitely remained at the charge of the

consumers.°°7

In support of its contention, Respondent relies on the Italian Supreme Administrative
Court’s Decision in 2014, where the Court confirmed the authorities’ power to alter
imbalance costs, so long as they were “in compliance with the principle of equal treatment
of economic operators in the sector, the arrangements to share imbalance costs taking into

account the particular features of the source”.°*

651. Spalma-incentivi_Decree: It is Respondent’s case that the enactment of the Spalma-
incentivi Decree and the modification of the Conto Energia Decrees was consistent with

the framework and goals of the Legislative Decrees 387/2003, the Romani Decree and the

EU Directives, since they only required that investors are ensured a “fair” or “equitable”

remuneration. This was the regulatory outer limit for Italy to act within, which it did.

652. In this connection, Italy compares its regulatory regime to the Spanish and Czech
regulatory regimes for renewable energy sources. It relies on arbitral awards that have
found Spain and Czech Republic to not be in breach of the FET standard under the ECT,
on the ground that their challenged measures did not fundamentally alter the existing
regime. According to Italy, the Spalma-incentivi Decree was comparable to the Spanish
Royal Decrees of 2010, in terms of their effects of re-modulating the incentives offered to
investors.°° Further, Italy relies, inter alia, on Isolux v. Spain and Antaris v. Czech
Republic to submit that investors should have foreseen such re-modulation, in light of the
kind of market for renewable energy generally, and more specifically in light of the
framework legislation such as the Romani Decree that is comparable to what also existed
in Czech Republic.®! In support of its position, Italy also relies on the dissenting opinion

rendered by Prof. Sacerdoti in Greentech v. Italy, and the awards in CEF v. Italy and

Belenergia v. Italy.

sharply reduced creating an imbalance between the photovoltaic investors’ remuneration
and the reduced costs for producing electricity. This was detrimental for consumers, who
bore in entirety the growing economic weight of the incentives. According to Respondent,
it was in this backdrop that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was enacted to adjust the balance

between consumers and investors.°%

Further, Respondent points out that it had at the end of 2010, i-e., after the start of
Claimants’ investment, Italy adopted the so-called Salva Alcoa Decree (see {| 130-130
above), which extended the incentives of the Second Conto Energia Decree to all parties
having concluded the construction of the photovoltaic system by 31 December 2010, but
entered into operation by 30 June 2011. This resulted in improving the overall economic
situation of Claimants more than what they would have reasonably expected at the time of
their investments. According to Respondent, the Salva Alcoa Decree evidences the

reasonableness and consistency of the modification of the Conto Energia regime.°*

In addition, Respondent also states that Claimants did not conduct reasonable due diligence
expected from prudent and sophisticated investors such as them while investing in the
highly regulated market that the Italian renewable energy sector is. Moreover, according to
Respondent, Claimants’ investment model was prone to high risks, given the high leverage
(between 70% to 80%). In light of these factors, there was no disruptive impact on
Claimants sufficient to characterize Respondent’s conduct as a breach of its FET

obligations.°

Off-take_Regime: Respondent submits that the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s
Regulations, pertaining to the grant of minimum prices for purchase of renewable energy
by the GSE were not the primary rules governing grant of minimum guaranteed prices.
Respondent contends that the primary rules underlying these Regulations, were Article 13
of Legislative Decree No. 387/03 and Article 1(41) of Law No. 39/2004. These provisions

were limited to creating the off-take regime, without referring in any way to a further

favourable mechanism such as that of minimum guaranteed prices, which was only a
regulatory offshoot of the off-take regime. It is Respondent’s case that Claimants’ reliance
on the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Regulations as a basis for its legitimate

expectations regarding the grant of minimum guaranteed price is thus misplaced.°*°

Respondent disputes Claimants’ reliance on the preamble of the Resolution 280/2007 (see
{| 617 above), by contending that the text of the Preamble refers to the grant of the
“economic survival” of smaller plants, not to a high and durable profitability separated
from the economic conditions of the investment. Further, as per the regime in Resolution
280/2007, Claimants should have expected a yearly revision of the minimum guaranteed

prices.°”

Respondent also disputes Claimants’ reliance on the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s
past practice during 2008 to 2013 in fixing the minimum guaranteed price as being “legally
baseless”, since such a trend in fixed prices is not sufficient per se to create an expectation

regarding their maintenance prices over time.

Respondent further relies on Article 7(4) of the Annex A to the Resolution 280/2007 to
contend that the rules establishing the minimum prices system had taken into account the

possibility that the prices determined by the Authority be lower than the market prices.

Respondent submits that notwithstanding the above, Resolution 618/2013, which is under
challenge by Claimants for having established a lower minimum guaranteed price than
expected is reasonable and coherent with the objectives of the minimum prices system.
Respondent submits that the price guaranteed under the Resolution 618/2013 achieves the
objective of ensuring economic survival of small plants by covering the producers’

operational costs, with a basic remuneration of capital.°”°

Likewise, with respect to the Legislative Decree No. 145/2013 or the Destinazione Italia,

Respondent contends that this rule is absolutely reasonable and coherent with the system.

Respondent argues that there is no relevant rule to suggest that incentive tariffs and
minimum prices should be cumulative for photovoltaic plants with capacity until 1 MW,
nor is such accumulation of the two always financially sustainable. Respondent contends
that Legislative Decree No. 145/2013 is also consistent with the Resolution 280/2007, in
that it allows for the maintenance of cumulative effects of incentive tariffs and minimum

prices for plants not exceeding the capacity of 100 kw.°”!

(ii) Transparency and Consistency
Respondent disputes Claimants’ allegations relating to inconsistent and non-transparent
conduct. According to Respondent, all of the measures in question, i.e., application of the
Administrative Management Fee, the attribution of imbalance costs and the Spalma-

incentivi Decree were “reasonable and consistent measures”.°”

In this regard, Respondent recalls its submissions relating to Claimants’ alleged legitimate
expectations (see {{] 644-661 above). Furthermore, Respondent states that the manner in
which the Spalma-incentivi Decree was enacted was not devoid of transparency.
Respondent characterizes the Spalma-incentivi Decree as a “physiological adaptation” or
fine tuning of the incentive tariff scheme already in existence, which was foreseen by
Article 23 of the Romani Decree, and the Third and Fourth Conto Energia Decrees.°”
(iii) Good faith

According to Respondent, Claimants do not, in relation to any of the measures under
challenge, contend that these measures were directed individually against Claimants in bad
faith. Respondent contends that Claimants also do not raise any question regarding the
Italian organ’s bad faith. According to Respondent, this belies Claimants’ FET claim on

grounds of bad faith.°”*

To establish its good faith, Respondent, in any event, reiterates that the imposition of the

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

At the outset, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to reproduce Article 10(1) ECT, in its

relevant part:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,
encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent _conditions
for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such
conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment . . . In no
case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that
required by international law, including treaty obligations. (emphasis added)

 

To determine whether Respondent is in breach of its obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment to Claimants’ investments, the Tribunal shall first resolve the Parties’ differences
in respect of the legal standard for the FET obligation, including the legal standard for each
tenet of the FET obligation that the Parties address, i.e., legitimate expectations,
transparency and consistency and good faith. Thereafter, in light of the legal standard
determined, the Tribunal shall determine whether Respondent’s conduct qualifies as a

breach of its FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT.

a. The Legal Standard

With respect to the general legal standard for the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT,
the Parties are in dispute about two interrelated matters: (i) whether the legal standard for
the FET obligation in the ECT is the same as the customary international law minimum
standard for FET obligations; and (ii) the precise scope of the legal standard for the FET
obligation under Article 10(1) ECT.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

(i) | The Customary International Law Standard for FET
obligations
Claimants have rejected the assimilation of the legal standard for the FET obligation in
Article 10(1) ECT to the customary international law minimum standard for FET
obligations (see { 589 above). Specifically, Claimants’ rejection is premised on the
grounds that (i) the international minimum standard of treatment “is exactly that: it is the
absolute bare minimum required under customary international law” and nothing more;
and (ii) Article 10(1) ECT is not comparable to Article 1105 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), wherein the FET obligation is not autonomous and is
expressly subsumed by a reference to international law. As per Claimants, the ECT’s FET
obligation has an autonomous legal standard that is not linked to this customary

international law minimum standard.°”°

To the contrary, Respondent has endorsed the link between the legal standard for the
ECT’s FET obligation and the customary international law minimum standard (see {| 625
above), relying on the hermeneutical principle that, according to Respondent, requires
international treaties to be interpreted, if possible, in a manner consistent with general

international law.°””
The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s submission for the following reasons.

First, the Tribunal considers that the text of Article 10(1) ECT itself creates a distinction
between the FET obligation therein, and the international minimum standard for FET
obligations. After laying out the FET obligation in the second sentence, Article 10(1) ECT,
in its fourth sentence, provides that “[iJn no case shall such Investments be accorded
treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty
obligations” (see emphasised part in § 666 above). This independent reference to the
treatment required by international law creates a demarcation between the legal standard
for the FET obligation contained in the second sentence and the treatment required by
international law. This demarcation becomes apparent when Article 10(1) ECT is

juxtaposed against Article 1105 NAFTA, which is titled “Minimum Standard of

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Treatment”, and requires the host State to “accord to investments of investors of another
Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment

. .” Thus, as Claimants rightly submit, NAFTA explicitly equates the standard of
treatment to the international law minimum standard, within which the FET obligations are
subsumed. Article 10(1) ECT does not create any such link between the FET obligation

therein and the customary international law minimum standard.

Second, the phrase “less favourable than . . . required by international law, including treaty
obligations” in the fourth sentence of Article 10(1) ECT indicates that the customary
international law minimum standard does get incorporated into the ECT, but only as the
bare minimum threshold that the host State’s treatment of investments must meet.
Accordingly, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ submission that the customary
international law minimum standard is nothing more than the absolute bare minimum
standard of treatment required under international law. In other words, as stated by the
tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina, when interpreting a similarly drafted FET clause in another
treaty, this minimum standard constitutes a “floor, [but] not a ceiling”, of the standard of

treatment that may be required from host States under the ECT.°7®

Third, while the ECT does not define the FET obligation or the legal standard for the same,
the Tribunal does not consider such absence of definition to warrant an automatic resort to
the customary international law minimum standard. In this regard, the Tribunal is neither
persuaded by Respondent’s suggestion that there exists a hermeneutical principle of
interpretation that requires international treaties to be interpreted consistent with customary
international law, nor does it consider that interpretation of Article 10(1) ECT in
accordance with the principles of interpretation in international law results in the
application of the customary international law minimum standard. Articles 31 and 32
VCLT constitute the principles of interpretation of treaties in international law. In the next
sub-section, the Tribunal shall determine the precise legal standard for the FET obligation,
based on an interpretation of Article 10(1) ECT in accordance with the principles in

Articles 31 and 32 VCLT.

(ii) The Legal Standard under Article 1001) ECT.

As mentioned in J 674 above, Article 10(1) ECT does not define the FET obligation or the

legal standard, nor are the terms “fair and equitable” ascribed a definition.

Accordingly, in order to delineate the elements of the legal standard for the FET obligation
under Article 10(1) ECT, the relevant part of the provision — “a commitment to accord at
all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment” — is required to be interpreted according to Article 31(1) VCLT. Article 31(1)
VCLT (quoted in J 289 above) requires a treaty provision to be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the

light of its object and purpose.

As part of the context of the above quoted part of Article 10(1) ECT, the Tribunal notes the
immediately preceding sentence in the said provision, which states that “[e]ach Contracting

Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable.

 

equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties
to make Investments in its Area”. (emphasis added) The Tribunal considers it important to
note here that the FET obligation, contained in particular in the second sentence of Article
10(1) ECT, is stipulated as being included within this broad contextual framework of
encouraging and creating stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for

investors.

As part of the object and purpose of the ECT, the Tribunal notes Article 2 ECT, which
stipulates the purpose of the treaty as being to establish “a legal framework in order to
promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual
benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.” Pursuant to the
reference to the International Energy Charter in Article 2 ECT, the Tribunal also considers
it appropriate to extract the following passages from the Objectives (Title I) and
Implementation (Title II) of the International Energy Charter:

- “Recognising the sovereignty of each State over its energy resources, and its

rights to regulate energy transmission and transportation within its territory

respecting all its relevant international obligations, and in a spirit of political
and economic cooperation, they decide to promote the development of

efficient, stable and transparent energy markets at regional and global levels

based on the principle of non-discrimination and market-oriented price
formation, taking into account environmental concerns and the role of energy
in each country’s national development”;

- “formulation of stable and transparent legal frameworks creating conditions for
the development of energy resources in the context of sustainable
development”;

- “creating a favourable environment for investments, including joint venture
investments, for design, construction and operation of energy installations”;
and

- “provide, at national level, for a stable, transparent legal framework for foreign
investments, in conformity with the relevant international laws and rules on
investment and trade.” (emphasis added)

From the above passages concerning the object and purpose behind the ECT, and in turn

the International Energy Charter, the Tribunal delineates two key features that lend to an

understanding of the FET legal standard, taking into account the context of Article 10(1)

ECT as well (see {677 above).

Firstly, the ECT prioritizes the objectives of stability and transparency in the legal
framework both at the national and the global level. Both these objectives are often
repeated as aspirational goals in the International Energy Charter, and also constitute a part

of the broader contextual framework laid down in the first sentence of Article 10(1) ECT.

Secondly, it becomes apparent from Article 2 ECT and the objectives of the International
Energy Charter that the ECT is intended to establish a “legal framework” so as to promote
long-term cooperation between the ECT Contracting Parties. In this regard, the Tribunal
notes that both Parties consider one of the fundamental objectives of the ECT to be
strengthening “the rule of law on energy issues”.*”? The Tribunal agrees that strengthening
the rule of law constitutes an important purpose behind the ECT, and the objectives of

stability and transparency are constituent parts of this larger purpose.

Taking into account the above context and in light of the object and purpose of the ECT,
the Tribunal makes the following observations with respect to the standard of FET

obligation under Article 10(1) ECT.

For Claimants’ position, see | 589 above; for Respondent's position, see Hr. Tr. Day 4, pp. 228:15-228:17.

SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

First, the Tribunal considers that fairness and/or equitability are not absolute concepts that
are capable of being reduced to universally applicable definitions. Instead, what constitutes
fair and/or equitable treatment is a question to be determined by taking into account all
circumstances of a given case. Claimants’ submission that an understanding of the terms
“fair” and “equitable” should be derived from their dictionary meanings? does not
persuade this Tribunal, and is contradicted by the cases that they rely on in this connection.
For instance, the Micula v. Romania tribunal specifically found that “[t]he plain meaning

of these terms does not provide much assistance”.®*! Similarly, the tribunal in Saluka v.

 

Czech Republic found that the terms “fair” and “equitable” can “only be defined by terms

of almost equal vagueness”.°*?

Second, stability and transparency in the legal framework are important ingredients of the
host State’s FET obligation. This is evidenced not only from the above discussed context
and object and purpose of the ECT, but is also unanimously accepted in investment
arbitration case law.®** In this connection, it is also important to note that as part of this
general obligation to maintain stability and transparency in the legal framework, host

States are also required to generally create a favourable environment for investments.

Third, keeping in mind that the FET obligation requires all relevant circumstances to be
considered in a case (see {| 683 above), the objectives of creating a stable, transparent and
favourable legal framework for investments are required to be balanced against the host
State’s right to regulate. The importance of the host State’s sovereignty and its right to
regulate is recognized in the International Energy Charter, when it mentions the
“sovereignty of each State over its energy resources, and its rights to regulate energy

transmission and transportation within its territory” (see {678 above).

Accordingly, to this end, the Tribunal endorses Respondent’s submission that any

determinations relating to the FET obligation shall take into account and balance the

positions of, both, the foreign investor and the host State (see { 628 above). This
proposition, and the important role of the host State’s right to regulate, has been accepted

by other investment arbitration tribunals as well.°*+

It is important to note that Claimants do not completely reject the relevance of the host
State’s right to regulate in their submissions relating to the FET legal standard. The
disagreement between the Parties is rather about the extent to which this right to regulate
should be considered by the Tribunal. In particular, as per Claimants, it is only in the
absence of specific (contractual or other) promises made by host States to investors that the
investors’ alleged expectations are required to be balanced against the host State’s
regulatory authority (see { 593 above). The Tribunal shall examine the Parties’
disagreement, and Claimants’ specific submission in this regard, in the forthcoming sub-
section, when it analyses the legal standard for the tenet of legitimate expectations, and

after it determines the role of specific promises made by host States therein.

Fourth, the Tribunal considers that keeping in mind the balancing of the above factors, the
overall standard to establish a breach of the FET obligation is high. Not every shortcoming
in a State’s action will justify a claim for breach of the FET standard. To constitute a
breach of the FET standard, it must be shown that the host State’s conduct was manifestly
or grossly unfair or unreasonable, was arbitrary or discriminatory, constituted a denial of
justice in national proceedings in the host State, or that the host State engaged in a wilful
neglect of duty or a wilful disregard of due process of law, or showed an extreme
insufficiency of action falling far below international standards. As articulated by the

685

tribunals in AES v. Hungary,°” the conduct must be such as to shock judicial propriety.

In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that it had invited the Parties to provide their comments
on the legal standard for the FET obligation laid down in the AES v. Hungary case, in

particular in the following passage:

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

The Tribunal has approached this question on the basis that it is not every
process failing or imperfection that will amount to a failure to provide fair and
equitable treatment. The standard is not one of perfection. It is only when a
state’s acts or procedural omissions are, on the facts and in the context before
the adjudicator, manifestly unfair or unreasonable (such as would shock, or at
least surprise a sense of juridical propriety) — . . . that the standard can be said
to have been infringed.*°

690. While Respondent has consistently endorsed the above formulation of the FET standard in
the AES v. Hungary case,°*’ Claimants have characterized it as an “outlier” for being closer

to the customary international law minimum standard (see { 589 above).

691.

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ characterization. Certain elements of the
above articulation of the FET standard overlap with the formulation of the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment in case law. For instance, the phrase
“shock, or at least surprise a sense of juridical propriety” finds resonance in Tecmed v.
Mexico®® and Waste Management v. Mexico.®® However, that does not imply that the
articulation of the FET standard by the tribunal in AES v. Hungary, which was laid down
precisely in the context of Article 10(1) ECT, is the same as the customary international
law minimum standard or that it is an outlier. For instance, numerous tribunals have
alluded to the FET standard being high, such that only “manifestly” unfair, unreasonable or
inequitable conduct by the host State would create a breach of the FET standard.®” This
includes the Micula v. Romania case relied upon by Claimants, which has taken inspiration
from the Waste Management v. Mexico case to find that, in order for a breach of the FET
standard, the host State’s conduct has to be “substantively improper, whether because it is

arbitrary, manifestly unreasonable, discriminatory or in bad faith”.°!

In light of the above, the Tribunal considers that the overall legal standard to establish a
breach of an FET obligation is high. Along the same lines, the Tribunal is convinced by
Respondent’s contention that for any regulatory change brought by the host State to
amount to a breach of the FET obligation, such regulatory change should rise to the level
of a “radical or fundamental” change. To this end, the Tribunal agrees with the findings of
the tribunals in Greentech v. Spain, Novenergia II v. Spain and Eiser v. Spain.®? In this
connection, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ submission that any departure
from the regulatory regime, for instance even a “one thousandth of a euro cent” reduction

693

in the promised tariffs,°’’ would constitute a breach of the FET obligation of the host State.

With the above contours of the general legal standard for the FET obligation in mind, the
Tribunal shall next examine the legal standard for each of the independent tenets that
Claimants advance as constituent parts of the FET obligation, i.e., (i) legitimate
expectations; (ii) transparency and consistency; and (iii) good faith. With respect to the
latter two, the Tribunal is mindful that Respondent disputes whether they exist as
independent tenets of the FET obligation or are subsumed within the legitimate
expectations tenet and/or the general legal standard for the FET obligation itself. The

Tribunal shall examine this disputed issue in the forthcoming sub-sections as well.

(iii) Legitimate Expectations
Both, Claimant and Respondents, agree that the protection of legitimate expectations of
investors is a constituent element of the host State’s FET obligation (see {{ 591 and 627
above). However, the disagreement between the Parties pertains to the elements of the
legal standard for examining whether the investors’ legitimate expectations have been

frustrated by the host State.

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that there are broadly three questions to be answered as

part of this examination: (a) whether the investors in the case had any expectations based

on any conduct of the host State, and if so, whether these expectations were legitimate; (b)
whether the investors relied on these expectations to make their investments in the host
State; and (c) whether the host State by its subsequent conduct frustrated these
expectations. If any of these three questions is answered in the negative, the investors’

claim for breach of the FET obligation fails.

The Tribunal shall examine the specific legal contours of the above three questions next,
and in the process, analyse the Parties’ submissions with respect to the legal standard for

protection of legitimate expectations.

  

The Le;

 

macy of the Inv

 

ors’ Expectations

With respect to the first question in {| 695 above, at the outset, the Tribunal endorses
Respondent’s position that the legitimacy of the investors’ investments must be assessed
by taking into account all prevailing circumstances, and by objectively balancing the
positions of the foreign investors and the host State (see { 628 above). This is supported by
the Tribunal’s findings relating to the overall legal standard for the FET obligation
discussed above (see {| 683 above). In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in
Saluka v. Czech Republic, when it stated that “the scope of the Treaty’s protection of
foreign investment against unfair and inequitable treatment cannot exclusively be
determined by foreign investors’ subjective motivations and considerations. Their
expectations, in order for them to be protected, must rise to the level of legitimacy and
reasonableness in light of the circumstances.”°** (emphasis added) Thus, the issue under
examination is whether the investors’ expectations rise to a level of legitimacy and

reasonableness in light of all the circumstances.

Having laid out the above context, the Tribunal shall next examine the various differences
between the Parties with respect to this first question in { 695 above. These are (i) whether
specific promises or commitments by the host State are required to create legitimate
expectations; (ii) whether these legitimate expectations should emanate from so-called

“crystallized rights”; and (iii) whether and to what extent the investors’ due diligence is a

factor to examine in the overall circumstances to be considered while examining the

legitimacy and reasonableness of the investors’ expectations.

On the first disputed matter mentioned in { 698 above, the Tribunal considers that
legitimate expectations can be created in the absence of specific promises or commitments
by the host State. Claimants have rightly submitted that explicit promises, by way of
contractual undertakings or otherwise, are not indispensable to the creation of legitimate

expectations. Respondent does not specifically call in issue this proposition either.

Moreover, this view has been consistently endorsed in investment arbitration case law,
most notably in the Parkerings v. Lithuania case, relied upon by Claimants, where the
tribunal found that “[t]he expectation is legitimate if the investor received an explicit
promise or guaranty from the host-State, or if implicitly, the host-State made assurances or
representation that the investor took into account in making the investment.” (emphasis
added) Accordingly, a number of tribunals have found that these expectations may be
derived from the “conditions that were offered by the State to the investor at the time of the

investment”, and need not be manifested in explicit promises.°°

The aspects relating to the first issue mentioned in { 698 above that are debated between
the Parties pertain to whether and how the legal standard for assessing the legitimacy of
investors’ expectations is affected when such expectations are not created or confirmed by

specific commitments. In this regard, two points are relevant to mention.

Firstly, Respondent contends that the obligation to protect legitimate expectations of
investors cannot be treated as an obligation to keep the host State’s legal regime frozen in
time, unless the host State has specifically committed to a stabilization or freezing clause.

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent’s submission. The Tribunal has already found that

the maintenance of a stable and transparent legal framework is an important ingredient of
the host State’s FET obligation (see § 684 above), and is thus also a relevant feature of the
constituent obligation to protect the investors’ legitimate expectations. However, in the
absence of a stabilization clause, this obligation cannot magnify itself such as to require
host States to freeze their regulatory systems. This proposition has been universally

endorsed in investment arbitration case law.”

Secondly, Claimants propose that it is only in the limited situation when there are no
specific commitments made by the host State that the host State’s regulatory authority
should be considered in the legitimate expectations analysis as a balancing element. The
Tribunal does not endorse this proposition as a matter of principle under Article 10(1)
ECT. The Tribunal has already found above that the general legal standard for the FET
obligation requires a consideration of the host State’s regulatory powers (see [| 685-686
above). That general proposition does not depend on the presence or absence of specific
commitments for the purposes of a legitimate expectations analysis. In other words, the
presence of specific commitments, contractual or otherwise, cannot automatically eliminate
or diminish the significance of the host State’s regulatory powers for the purposes of its

FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT. Instead, as helpfully explained by the tribunals in

98 9

Electrabel v. Hungary®® and Antaris v. Czech Republic, specific commitments only
“make a difference to the assessment of the investor’s knowledge and of the
reasonableness and legitimacy of its expectations”. They do not render the host State’s

regulatory powers nugatory.

This brings the Tribunal to the second disputed matter mentioned in { 698 above
concerning the requirement, if any, for legitimate expectations to stem from “crystallized

rights”. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Claimants derive the term “crystallized

rights” from the following finding of the CEF v. Italy tribunal, which they criticize for

being an incorrect application of the legitimate expectations standard:
Claimant, in reality, at the time of the making of both the Megasol and the
Phenix investments still had a number of steps to take before it knew for
certain that the hoped-for incentives were actually awarded to it. It enjoyed no
guarantee of success at the time of investment, and nothing in any of
Respondent’s Contos could infer that a party in Claimant’s position as of such
dates was inevitably going to be awarded the incentives. The fact that Claimant
did indeed, at a later time, succeed in all respects for both Megasol and Phenix
does not assist it as of the dates upon which it made those investments. What is
decisive is that as of those dates the protection of Claimant’s investment rights
had not yet crystallized.” (emphasis added)

Keeping aside the factual matters at issue in the CEF v. Italy case, the Tribunal is of the
view that Claimants, in their criticism of the legal motivations of the CEF v. Italy tribunal,
read more into the above emphasised phrase than warranted. According to Claimants, this
passage represents a limited understanding of an “investment” as covering only
“crystallised rights” on the date of the first investment, as opposed to the more liberal
understanding of an “investment” as a multi-staged process. Furthermore, Claimants are of
the view that this passage is also an incorrect application of the temporal issue of the point
in time in reference to which legitimate expectations should be analysed (see {[[ 595-596

above).

In order to appropriately understand the above emphasised passage from the CEF v. Italy
award, this Tribunal considers it important to read the passage in the right context.
Immediately prior to the above quoted paragraph, the CEF v. Italy tribunal had clarified
that its determinations herein were focussed on the “important temporal point” about
whether any legitimate expectations existed at the time the investors made their
investment.””! Accordingly, the above quoted paragraph commences with the phrase “at
the time of the making of . . . investments”. Thus, Claimants’ first point of criticism, about
the CEF y. Italy tribunal’s allegedly limited understanding of an “investment” is
misplaced. A contextual reading of the above quoted passage indicates that the CEF v.
Ttaly tribunal was not examining the issue of what constitutes an “investment”, and

whether an investment is a single-step or a multi-step process. Instead, the CEF v. Italy
tribunal was only examining the temporal issue about when legitimate expectations should

exist. This distinct issue is analysed in greater detail in {{[ 715 et seg. below.

In the above quoted passage, the CEF v. Italy tribunal also discussed the form in which the
legitimate expectations should exist at the time the investor makes its investment, i.e.,
whether the investor in that case “knew for certain that the hoped-for incentives were
actually awarded to it” and “was inevitably going to be awarded the incentives”.’°
(emphasis added) Thus, in referring to “crystallized” investment rights, the CEF v. Italy
tribunal was only distinguishing expectations that are merely “hoped-for” and those that
the investor “knew for certain”. Contrary to how Claimants perceive it,’ this distinction
between mere hopes and knowable, certain expectations does not per se relate to the
distinction between promises created in general framework legislation versus promises
created by specific letters or contracts. The latter is a separate matter, with respect to which
this Tribunal has already found that legitimate expectations do not necessarily need to be

sourced from specific promises in contracts (see {| 699-701 above).

Instead, the Tribunal considers that the distinction between hopes and knowable
expectations goes towards the level of certainty of expectations that the host State’s
conduct creates for investors, and in turn, “the level of legitimacy and reasonableness”’™*
alluded to earlier (see | 697 above). A number of tribunals have alluded to this distinction,
albeit in different manners. This includes tribunals whose decisions and awards Claimants
rely on. For instance, the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary found that “expectations must
be based on more than subjective beliefs”,’°°

be “against the background of information that the investor knew and should reasonably

and the assessment of whether they are must

have known at the time of the investment and of the conduct of the host State”.7°

Spain,” and Belenergia v. Italy”? have also emphasised on the “objective standard” for
assessing the expectations, based on the information that investors knew or should have
known at the time of investing. Similarly, the tribunal in Antaris v. Czech Republic found
that “[a] claim based on legitimate expectation must proceed from an identification of the

origin of the expectation alleged, so that its scope can be formulated with precision.””!°

This Tribunal considers the above articulations to have the same effect as the CEF v. Italy
tribunal’s reference to “crystallized” investment rights, which is to say that investors’
subjective hopes or beliefs do not qualify to create legitimate and reasonable expectations.
These expectations are required to be “crystallized” in a form that is objectively
discernible, or as the tribunal in LG&E v. Argentina put it, the expectations “must exist and

be enforceable by law” in order to be protected.”!!

Therefore, with respect to the second disputed matter in { 698 above, this Tribunal finds
that legitimate expectations should be “crystallized”, inasmuch as they are required to be

objectively knowable and certain, and not based on subjective hopes or beliefs.

This leads the Tribunal to the third disputed matter mentioned in {| 698 above, pertaining to
the requirement of due diligence on part of the investors prior to investing in the host State.
The Tribunal has already found in {J 683 and 697 above that an examination of the
legitimacy of expectations should take into account all relevant circumstances in a given
case. Whether and to what extent the investors’ duty to conduct due diligence falls within

this gamut of circumstances is what the Tribunal shall determine next.

Claimants do not dispute the existence of the investors’ duty of due diligence, but presents
a different standard for this duty than that presented by Respondent. Respondent relies on
the above quoted passage from Electrabel v. Hungary (see J 708 above) and on Masdar v.

Spain to argue the standard of “appropriate due diligence [showing] that [the investor] has

familiarized itself with the existing laws”.”!* Claimants rely on a passage from the award in
Novenergia II v. Spain to submit that for the host State to establish a deficiency in the
investor’s due diligence, the State must establish that reasonable due diligence would have

revealed the regulatory change of which the investor complains.”

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ proposed standard for due diligence. To
require the host State to establish what due diligence could or would have revealed is to
place the burden of proof on the host State with respect to the investors’ duty of due
diligence. That is an anomaly, since the duty of due diligence is the investor’s and hence

the burden to establish the same, in turn, falls on the investor.

This placement of the burden of proof is in line with investment arbitration case law. The
standard of due diligence that investors are expected to adhere to should meet the threshold
of what a “prudent investor” would “reasonably” do to know about regulatory framework
in question. This standard of reasonable due diligence, as opposed to “extensive legal
investigation”, has found the endorsement of many tribunals, including the tribunal in
Electrabel v. Hungary (quoted in {{ 708 above) and several others in more recent cases.”!+
A more specific articulation of this standard, with which the Tribunal agrees, can be found
in the Antaris v. Czech Republic award, in the following passage:

[G]iven the State’s regulatory powers, in order to rely on legitimate

expectations the investor should inquire in advance regarding the prospects of a

change in the regulatory framework in light of the then prevailing or

reasonably to be expected changes in the economic and social conditions of the
host State.”7!

Investors’ Reliance on Legitimate Expectations to make their I S

715. The second question in { 695 above, i.e., whether the investor relied on these expectations
to make their investments in the host State, is primarily a question of fact. The only legal
aspect that the Tribunal is required to determine for the purpose of this question concerns
the point of time in reference to which the investor’s legitimate expectations should be

assessed.

716. Both, Claimants and Respondent, agree with the general proposition that the relevant point
of time to assess an investor’s legitimate expectations is the time of making of the
investments (see {J 595 and 631 above). This proposition has also met the consistent

approval of investment arbitration tribunals.”

717. However, in response to the Tribunal’s question during the Hearing about the moment “at
which . . . legitimate expectations have to be taken into account”,’!” Claimants presented a
nuanced line of argument, pointing out that often it is not possible to narrow an investment
down to an exact date when it was made, since investments are usually multi-staged,
sophisticated and complex transactions that are spread out over a period of time.”'* In
furtherance of this, Claimants submit that the investor’s legitimate expectations may be
grounded on the overall legal order or conditions offered by the host State when the
investment was made, and may continue to evolve over time. Claimant’ submission is that
if the process of investment continues in reliance of the evolved legitimate expectation,
those subsequent transactions forming part of the overall investment may also be protected.

Claimants rely on multiple sources for this proposition”!

718. The Tribunal considers that Claimants are correct to point out the nuances about the
investment making process. On occasions, it may indeed be difficult to reduce the
investment to one day, or to pin-point exactly at what time the investment was made. The
Tribunal considers that in such situations, the timing of the investors’ decision to make the
investment, as opposed to the timing of the investment itself, becomes significant.
Claimants accepted this proposition in the following submission made during the Hearing:

We believe it is well established in treaty case law that the date on which to
assess whether a claimant’s expectations are legitimate is the date of the
decision to invest. So it is the date when the decision to invest was made.’
(emphasis added)

719. In support of their submission, Claimants cited the awards in Bayindir v. Pakistan and
Novenergia II v. Spain.”"! Both these cases have indeed focussed their temporal analysis of
legitimate expectations on the date of the decision to invest.’”” The Novenergia II v. Spain
award examined this issue in detail, in the following passages:

Based on the above, the Tribunal is of the view that the relevant time for
making the assessment of the Claimant's legitimate expectations is at the time
when the investment was made. The more difficult issue is to determine in an
actual case when such investment was in fact made. It is of course not unusual
in larger projects that the investment phase transcends through various stages;
negotiations, due diligence, internal corporate decisions, external contractual
commitments, financing, acquisition, construction, registration, start-up and the
first generation of revenues. In addition, the investment is sometimes structured

to be executed in consecutive stages even if there are binding commitments
predating such subsequent stages.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

The Tribunal is of the view that the timing of the investor’s decision to invest
sets a backstop date for the evaluation of legitimate expectations . . .’%
(emphasis in original)

720. The Tribunal agrees with the above findings of the tribunal in Novenergia II v. Spain.
Accordingly, for an investment that was made in multiple stages, the temporal analysis
should focus on the legitimate expectations that existed, if any, at the time the investor
decided to make that investment. It falls upon the investor to establish that at this point in
time, there existed legitimate expectations upon which the investor relied and decided to

make its investment in the host State.

721.

In addition to the situation where an investment evolves over multiple stages, Claimants
also discuss the evolution of the legitimate expectations over a course of time, and how
legitimate expectations created or “crystallized” after the investment is first made can also
be protected under Article 10(1) ECT. According to Claimants, in such circumstances, if
multiple investment decisions were made in reliance of the legitimate expectations that
evolved over time, such legitimate expectations and investments also deserve protection. In
these circumstances, Claimants submit that it is not possible to focus only on one particular

point in time for the identification of legitimate expectations.’”*

722. The Tribunal considers that in situations where legitimate expectations evolve over time,
while it may not be feasible to identify a singular point in time for creation of legitimate
expectations, it is still required that the legitimate expectations being claimed are
objectively knowable and certain for the multiple stages of the investment. In this regard,
the Tribunal agrees with the following findings of the tribunal in Crystallex v. Venezuela,
relied upon by Claimants:

A legitimate expectation is normally said to arise “at the time of making the
investment”. In the Tribunal’s eyes, this is logical, as it is the investor’s

reliance on a promise which may prompt, or contribute to, its decision to invest
and proceed with that investment, and which makes in turn the expectation
worthy of legal protection. In certain cases, however, “investments are made
through several steps, spread over a period of time” . . . [I]n these instances

‘legitimate expectations must be examined for each stage at which a decisive
step is taken towards the creation, expansion, development, or reorganisation
of the investment”.”*° (emphasis added and footnotes omitted)

Thus, even in cases of multiple stages of one investment or multiple related investments
made by the investor, it still falls upon the investor to identify for each such stage the
precise legitimate expectation that was created by the host State and relied upon by the

investor to make or expand the investment.

Accordingly, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimants’ characterization of this issue as
one wherein the “reliance” by the investor to make or expand an investment is somehow
more “critical” than the “precise ‘timing’ of a particular investment decision.”””° The
Tribunal considers that both the timing of the decision to invest and the reliance on any
legitimate expectations are related issues. The precise timing of each investment decision is
important to examine whether the investment decision was made in reliance of any
legitimate expectations. In this regard, the tribunal in Franck Charles Arif v. Republic of
Moldova, also relied upon by Claimants, pertinently observed that “a claim based on
legitimate expectations must proceed from the exact identification of the origin of the

expectation alleged, so that its scope can be formulated with precision.””?’

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the precise timing of the investor’s decision to make
(or expand) the investment(s) remains the focal point in time to examine the existence and
scope of any legitimate expectations created by the host State and relied upon by the
investor, regardless of whether the investment(s) were made as one-stop transactions or

multi-step processes.

The Standard for Frustration of Legiti Expectations

Finally, the Tribunal turns to the third question in { 695 above, i.e., whether the host State

by its subsequent conduct frustrated the investors’ legitimate expectations.

In this connection, the Tribunal need only recall the general legal standard for examining
the host State’s conduct under Article 10(1) ECT discussed in {| 675-693 above. Along
those lines, the Tribunal emphasises here that not every conduct of the host State that
breaches investors’ legitimate expectations would automatically amount to a breach of the
international law obligation under Article 10(1) ECT. For a breach of legitimate
expectations to qualify as a breach of the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT, the high
standard of the FET obligation is required to be satisfied by the host State’s conduct in

question.

As mentioned in {| 689 above, to constitute a breach of the FET standard, it must be shown
that the host State’s subsequent conduct was manifestly or grossly unfair or unreasonable,
was arbitrary or discriminatory, or that the host State engaged in a wilful neglect of duty or
a wilful disregard of due process of law, or showed an extreme insufficiency of action
falling far below international standards, such that the conduct would shock judicial

propriety.

(iv) Transparency and Consistency
The Parties are in dispute about whether the host State’s duty to act transparently and
consistently constitutes an independent tenet of the FET obligation, and if so to what
extent. While Claimants endorse the independence of this tenet of the FET obligation (see
{I 597-598 above), Respondent submits that the duty to act transparently and consistently

overlaps with the duty to protect investors’ legitimate expectations (see 634 above).

The Tribunal notes that Respondent’s view is that a host State’s duty to maintain stability
and/or consistency forms a part of its duty to protect the legitimate expectations of the
investor, whereas the State’s duty to maintain transparency is part of the general standard
of FET. Claimants have also acknowledged in their submissions that the principles of

transparency and consistency “may be related to each other and they may both relate to

general notions of stability and fairness.””** Moreover, although Claimants argue that a
breach of an FET obligation can theoretically be predicated on inconsistent or non-
transparent conduct even if the investor’s legitimate expectations were not frustrated, they
also admit that “transparency and consistency are probably most relevant to this Tribunal
in terms of its analysis of Italy’s defence to SunReserve’s legitimate expectations

claims.””°

The Tribunal does not consider the Parties’ positions to be too far apart from each other.
Both Parties agree that the host State’s duty to conduct itself in a transparent and consistent
manner forms part of the FET obligation in general, and that the demarcation between this
duty and the duty to preserve legitimate expectations is not watertight. In other words,
claims relating to the notions of transparent and consistent conduct may often factually
overlap with claims relating to the investor’s legitimate expectations. The Tribunal finds
this proposition uncontroversial. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that it has already
found stability and transparency to be inherent in the meaning of the FET obligation under

Article 10(1) ECT (see { 684 above).

The case law relied upon by the Parties has also treated the notions of transparency and
consistency as a part of the investor’s legitimate expectations. For instance, the tribunal in
Saluka v. Czech Republic found that “[a] foreign investor protected by the Treaty may in
any case properly expect that . . . [the host State’s] conduct does not manifestly violate the
requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and nondiscrimination.””*°
Similarly, other cases relied upon by Claimants, in particular Micula v. Romania and
Tecmed v. Mexico, also recognize that transparency and consistency form part of investor’s

legitimate expectations.”*!

That being said, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that it may be theoretically possible for

a breach of the FET obligation to be rooted in the host State’s inconsistent and/or non-

transparent conduct, even though the host State’s conduct does not amount to a frustration
of legitimate expectations. Whether that is the case or not depends on the overall facts and
circumstances of each case, which need to be considered in totality as part of the
Tribunal’s examination of any claim relating to a breach of an FET obligation (see J 683

above).

As part of these overall circumstances, the Tribunal considers it important to emphasise
here that the host State’s duty to conduct itself transparently and consistently should not be
“taken too literally”, and should therefore not “impose upon host States obligations which
would be inappropriate and unrealistic”, for instance requiring full disclosure or full access
to all information.”? This is especially when the notions of transparency and consistency
are under scrutiny independently of any legitimate expectations that may be supported in

specific contractual or other undertakings.

In the absence of such specific undertakings, when the question of breach only implicates a
host State’s regulatory changes, not every non-transparent or inconsistent regulatory
change of conduct would amount to a breach of the FET obligation. As already observed
by the Tribunal above (see J 692 above), in order for the regulatory change to amount to a
breach of the FET obligation, such a change should rise to the level of a “radical or
fundamental” change, in light of the high standard to satisfy a breach of the FET
obligation.”** In this connection, it is obvious that the host State’s regulatory authority
should be afforded due deference in any determination of whether the regulatory change is

a radical or fundamental one (see {| 685 above).

(v) Good Faith
Similar to the host State’s duty towards transparency and consistency, the Parties are in

disagreement about whether the requirement of good faith constitutes an independent facet

of the FET obligation, and if so to what extent. Claimants propose that the host State’s
obligation to treat investors in a bona fide manner, i.e., an even-handed and non-
discriminatory manner, constitutes a distinct obligation under the FET legal standard (see {
599 above). Respondent argues that the principle of good faith is inherent to the
interpretation and application of the FET standard and does not constitute an autonomous

obligation under the FET legal standard (see {| 635-636 above).

The Tribunal does not consider the requirement of good faith or bona fide conduct to
constitute a separate obligation under Article 10(1) ECT. Instead, the Tribunal is persuaded
by Respondent’s view that good faith is a fundamental concept that permeates across the

FET obligation in general, and all independent facets thereof.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that good faith is, first and foremost, a requirement for
interpretation of any treaty provision, including Article 10(1) ECT, in accordance with

Article 31(1) VCLT (quoted in {| 289 above, and see { 676 above).

Second, the Tribunal considers that good faith performance forms the essence of any
international law obligation, including the obligation of fair and equitable treatment. It is
obvious that no conduct which evidences bad faith can qualify as fair or equitable in
international law. Investment arbitration case law has consistently understood good faith as
being “at the heart of the concept of fair and equitable treatment”,”* or recognized that
“the concept of legitimate expectations is based on the requirement of good faith.”’*> This
holds equally true for cases relied upon by Claimants, for instance, Micula v. Romania,
which, inter alia, examined good faith as “a fundamental principle of international law that

States Party to a treaty must perform treaty obligations in good faith.”7*°

In any event, the Tribunal considers it important to emphasise that in order for bad faith or
mala fide conduct to be established, the burden on the investor is high. In light of the

overall high standard to establish a breach of the FET obligation alluded to above (see {

688 above), the Tribunal considers that for any course of action to qualify as bad faith or
mala fide, a wilfulness or intention, on part of the host State, of committing the unfair or
inequitable action has to be established. Not every unfair or inequitable action

automatically qualifies as an action in bad faith.’*”

b. Whether Italy Frustrated any of Claimants’ Legitimate
Expectations by enacting the Spalma-Incentivi Decree
Having determined the legal standard for each tenet of the FET obligation under issue, the
Tribunal shall next discuss Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations, and whether they
were frustrated by Italy. To examine this issue, the Tribunal shall (i) first, determine the
relevant point in time when Claimants decided to make their investment in Italy; (ii)
second, analyse whether Claimants’ decision to make their investment was based on any
expectations, and if so, whether these expectations were legitimate; and (iii) third, examine
whether any of Italy’s subsequent conduct results in the frustration of any of Claimants’

legitimate expectations.

(i) The Relevant Point in Time when Claimants Decided to
make their Investment in Italy

The Tribunal considers it appropriate to commence its analysis by first establishing the
temporal reference point that will form the basis for the Tribunal’s forthcoming
considerations as to the existence and frustration of any legitimate expectations that

Claimants may have relied upon.

In this regard, the Tribunal recalls the legal standard determined above, as per which in a
situation when a single investment is made in multiple stages, the temporal analysis should
focus on the legitimate expectations that existed, if any, at the time the investor decided to
make that investment (see {| 718-720 above). The same holds true if multiple investment
decisions are made in reliance of an evolving set of expectations, in which situation the
temporal analysis should focus on the legitimate expectations that existed, if any, at the
different points in time the investor made distinct decisions to make or expand its

investment (see {723 above). Thus, the issue currently under analysis concerns the point in

See, in this regard, CL-14, Ioan Micula et al. v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, Dec. 11,

time Claimants decided to make their investment in Italy, and whether that can be singled
out as one decisive point in time or is spread out into multiple different investment

decisions.

Claimants submit that their investments are comprised of various distinct facets, i.e., (i)
shares and equity participation in the Italian companies and the corresponding photovoltaic
facilities, as well as debt obligations with respect to those companies and facilities; (ii)
those companies’ rights to returns, claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to
the Conto Energia regime and the GSE contracts; (iii) tangible and intangible property and
property rights, including various photovoltaic facilities; (iv) rights conferred by law,
specifically, the rights to fixed incentive tariffs conferred through various Conto Energia
Decrees; and (v) rights conferred by licenses, permits, and contracts, including rights to

incentive tariffs.7°*

Further, Claimants emphasise that their investments were structured in a manner that the
payments would be made in a stage-wise manner in three milestones, as per the Framework
Agreement (see {| 184-185 above). Hence, even if the SPVs developing or operating the
photovoltaic plants were acquired earlier in time, since the majority of the milestone
payments were reserved until after the plants entered into operation, the relevant temporal
reference point for making of the investments, and in turn for a legitimate expectations

analysis should be the entry into operation for each plant (see { 607 above).

For Respondent, the point in time Claimants’ investment(s) were made, and in turn, the
point in time in reference to which the existence of Claimants’ alleged legitimate
expectations should be examined, is when Claimants acquired the relevant assets or
controlling stakes in the SPVs developing or operating the photovoltaic plants (see {| 642-
643 above).

Taking the above into account, the Tribunal identifies two related questions for
examination in this Section, in order to determine the relevant temporal reference point for

its analysis of Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations: (i) what constitutes Claimants’

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

investment(s); and (ii) whether Claimants’ investments were structured such as to comprise

multiple distinct investment decisions or a singular investment decision.

With respect to the first question in { 747 above, the definition of the term “investment”
under Article 1(6) ECT assumes relevance. According to this definition:
“Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or
indirectly by an Investor and includes:

(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any
property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of
equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and
other debt of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having
an economic value and associated with an Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;
(e) Returns;
(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and
permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in
the Energy Sector.
The Tribunal considers that the various facets of Claimants’ investment(s) in Italy that
Claimants advance (see {| 744 above) fall within sub-clauses (a) through (c) and (f) in

Article 1(6) ECT. This is not a disputed proposition in this case.

Moreover, Claimants do not argue that their investments in Italy were comprised of
multiple portfolios or many different investment activities. Accordingly, in the present
case, the Tribunal is not faced with investors that made multiple distinct investments at
different points of time. Instead, Claimants’ position is that their consolidated or
homogenous investment activity in the photovoltaic plants they acquired in Italy were

structured in multiple stages distributed over a course of time.

This brings the Tribunal to the second question in {| 747 above, i.e., whether the various
facets of Claimants’ investments in Italy were made as a result of one or multiple
investment decisions. To answer this question, the Tribunal considers the appropriate

starting point to be Article 1(8) ECT, which defines the term “Making of Investments” as

254

752.

753.

754.

755.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

“establishing new Investments, acquiring all or part of existing Investments or moving into

different fields of Investment activity.”

From the above definition, it is apparent that the ECT envisions the making of an
investment as an active mode of doing as opposed to a passive method of being granted
acquisition over assets. In other words, making an investment refers to the active conduct
of establishing or acquiring investments. As a natural corollary, the Tribunal considers that
the point in time when an investor decides to make its investments refers to the time when
the investor actively decided to establish or acquire investments in the host State. The fact
that the investments happened to evolve over time as a result of any rights being conferred
by statute or contract does not imply that each stage of evolution constitutes a distinct

investment decision.

In the present case, the Tribunal considers the point in time when Claimants decided to
make their investments in Italy to be the time when they acquired their shareholding in the
SPVs developing and/or operating the photovoltaic plants at issue. Accordingly, the
Tribunal agrees with Respondent’s line of argument (see §§ 642-643 above). This is for the

following reasons.

First, each of the different facets of Claimants’ investments (see {| 744 above) can, in legal
terms, be sourced back to the original acquisition of shares in the SPVs. Be it the SPVs’
alleged rights to returns granted by statute or contract, their claims to money or their claims
to performance pursuant to the Conto Energia regime and the GSE contracts, each of these
facets assumes legal relevance for Claimants under the ECT only as a consequence of the

original acquisition of the shareholding in the SPVs.

This was explained by Claimants’ witness, Mr. Mark Florian, during the Hearing in the

following exchange:

Q. So is this the document [CEX-335] by which the Claimants would have
acquired Rovigo? Is this the complete document, do you know?

A. I'd have to go back and look. But basically what we were doing was we
were buying Emmezeta, which was the entity that owned the Rovigo plant.
But the plant wasn’t fully constructed at the time, and so -- and we weren’t
going to take risk on the completion of the construction, the commissioning of
the plant and ultimately the feed-in tariff being applied. So while the

255

757.

758.

742

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

acquisition date may be relevant in terms of the legal ownership of the entity
that _ultimately would own the power plant, the more economically important

date was when we actually had a completed plant that had the feed-in tariff

applied to it.”*? (emphasis added)
It is clear from the above statement that Claimants understood the legal relevance of the
date on which the shareholding in the concerned SPVs was acquired by them. The
significance of that date also comes across in the document that Mr. Florian was being
directed to in the above exchange during the Hearing. That document, i.e., CEX-335, is the
Emmezeta Solar Energy S.r.1. Quota Transfer Deed dated 30 September 2010, whereby the
Second Claimant acquired the SPV, which was developing the Rovigo Plant, Emmezeta
Solar Energy S.r.1 (see { 204 above). Article 1(c) of this Quota Transfer Deed stated that
“[t]he sale of the Quota shall cause immediate transfer of the legal and beneficial title there
over.””“° (emphasis added) For clarification, as per this Deed, “Quota” represented “100%
of the corporate capital” of the concerned SPV.”*! Similar provisions can be found in other
Quota Transfer Deeds pertaining to the other eight photovoltaic power plants acquired by

Claimants.”

The fact that Claimants allocated their risks in such a manner that the risk of the
completion or the commissioning of the plants would not fall on them does not interfere
with the legal significance of the acquisition of shares in the SPVs developing and/or
operating these plants. The allocation of risk pertains to the manner in which the
investments were to be structured, which is distinct from the legal and beneficial transfer of

ownership of shares. The latter occurrence is the decisive point in time to be considered.

Second, the Tribunal does not agree that the date of acquisition of shares is less
“economically important” in comparison to the date when the Claimants’ plants became
entitled to the incentive tariffs (see | 755 above). Along these lines, Claimants also

submitted during the Hearing that the “date on which the shares were acquired in the local

SPVs by the SunReserve Luxco entity . . . occurred prior to the infusion of any substantial

amount of equity or shareholder loans.””4

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the above factual statement does not hold true for all
of Claimants’ power plants. For instance, for the Lenare Plant (997.92 kW), operated by
the SPV, Sunny Lenare S.r.1, the Quota Transfer Deed mentions the transfer price of EUR
1,421,962." For the San Marco Plant (985.71 kW), operated by the SPV, SunEdison
Apulia 007, the Quota Transfer Deed mentions the transfer price of EUR 1,720,357.’5 For
the Santoro Plant (968.31 kW), operated by the SPV, SunEdison Apulia 008 S.r.1., the
Quota Transfer Deed mentions the transfer price of EUR 1,634,147.74° Similarly, for the
Campania Plant (20.41 MW) operated by the SPV, Saniso S.r.]., the Quota Transfer
Agreement and the Quota Transfer Deed mention the provisional transfer price as EUR
2,110,000 and the purchase price is defined to include tranches of EUR 4.5 million and

EUR 6.5 million, to be paid in advance.747

Notwithstanding the above, the Tribunal also considers that, as a conceptual matter, even if
the equity was infused in the SPVs and/or the plants they were operating subsequent to the
initial acquisition of shares, this lapse in time does not take away from the fact that the
economic decision to invest in the plants had already been made when the shares in the
SPVs were acquired. The subsequent contribution of money would only contribute to the
value of the concerned SPVs and the photovoltaic plants, and, in turn, Claimants’ own
shareholding therein. However, it would not have any impact on Claimants’ already

existing shareholding in (and ownership of) these SPVs.

The economic significance of the acquisition of shares is also demonstrated by the fact that
Claimants’ damages calculation in this arbitration, as presented by their quantum expert,
FTI Consulting, is based specifically on “losses from the diminution in the value of their

investments in the Italian Plants (both the shares and the shareholder loans made to the

Parent Companies).””** Similarly, Claimants’ witness, Mr. Florian, also admitted during
the Hearing, that when Claimants sold their shares in the SPVs to a third party in August
2016,” they divested their entire investment portfolio in Italy:

Edwards report, the FTI report. You have it in front of you?

portfolio in Italy?

A. [believe so, yes, sir.

THE CHAIRMAN: And that’s what you referred to that was sold for which
price?

A. €104 million.”

762. In light of the above, the Tribunal considers Claimants’ acquisition of shares to not only be

legally relevant, but also economically relevant to determining the time when Claimants
decided to invest in Italy. Without Claimants’ initial acquisition of shares, the other facets

of its investment (see {| 744 above) would not hold legal or economic significance.

763. Third, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ submission that the different Milestone

Payments that were made pursuant to the Framework Agreement constituted distinct
investment decisions based on an evolving set of legitimate expectations. The fact that
Claimants structured their capital contributions in the acquired SPVs in three milestones
does not imply that Claimants made distinct investment decisions every time they made

these Milestone Payments.

764. In this connection, at the outset, the Tribunal notes that the term “Milestone Payments” is

748.

149

defined in the Framework Agreement as referring to “the payments . . . to be made. . .
pursuant to the EPC Agreement for [each] Project.””*! Thus, Milestone Payments were to
be made pursuant to the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreements, and not

pursuant to the share or quota transfer agreements relating to the acquisition of the SPVs.

The Tribunal has already determined above (see { 762 above) that the legally and
economically relevant event for examining the timing of Claimants’ decision to invest is

the acquisition of shares.

Further, the Framework Agreement is dated 21 May 2010 (see {| 184-185 above).
Accordingly, it predates Claimants’ acquisition of the shareholding in any of the SPVs that
operated the power plants at issue in this case (see table at { 768 below). Thus, when
Claimants decided to invest in Italy, the framework for its structured capital contributions
through the Milestone Payments was already in place. Hence, these subsequent Milestone
Payments cannot be characterized as distinct investment decisions that were made later in
time. These subsequent Milestone Payments were only an implementation of a mechanism

that already existed at the time of the original share acquisition.

Other than the above structured mechanism of Milestone Payments under the Framework
Agreement, Claimants have not presented any evidence to establish that their subsequent
equity payments or capital contributions were distinct investment decisions made later in

time.

During the Hearing, Claimants compared their case to the facts in Novenergia II v. Spain,
stating that the circumstances surrounding the investments in that case “is exactly — exactly
— what happened here”.”*? The Tribunal considers the following finding of the tribunal in
Novenergia II v. Spain to be pertinent, and along the same lines as this Tribunal’s findings

above:

The Tribunal is of the view that the timing of the investor’s decision to invest
sets a backstop date for the evaluation of legitimate expectations. In the present
case it is evidenced that the Claimant made its investment on 13 September
2007 when it acquired a 100% interest in the PV Plant Solarsaor. As from that
date the Claimant had irreversibly committed to investing in the Spanish PV
sector, which commitments were subsequently fulfilled_as_the Claimant
expended further funds for the development of the other PV Plants relevant for
this arbitration. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant made its
investment no later than 13 September 2007.7°? (emphasis added)

768. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, for each of Claimants’ power plants, the relevant
point in time when Claimants decided to make their investment(s), is the time when
Claimants acquired their shares in the SPVs operating and/or developing those plants. That
point time would be the date on which the relevant share or quota transfer agreement was
concluded. For each of Claimants’ nine power plants, that date is reflected in the column

(ii) | Whether Claimants’ Decision to Make their Investment Was
in Reliance of Any Legitimate Expectations
Having determined the relevant point in time in reference to which Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, if any, have to be examined, i.e., the date of acquisition of shares in the
concerned SPVs, the Tribunal shall next determine whether, and if so, what legitimate
expectations existed at this point in time. To this end, the Tribunal shall (i) first delineate
the exact contours of Claimants’ expectations that existed when they decided to make their
investment in Italy; and (ii) whether these expectations satisfy the legal threshold of

legitimacy discussed in Section VIII(3)(iii) above.

Expectations That Existed When Claimants Decided to Make Their Investment

Claimants have predicated their claims of legitimate expectations on numerous factors.
These include (i) Italy’s overall regulatory framework in the photovoltaic sector aimed at
meeting EU targets for renewable energy, in particular in the EC Directive 2001/77/EC
(implemented in Italy by way of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003) and the EC Directive
2009/28/EC (implemented in Italy by way of the Romani Decree); (ii) the five Conto
Energia Decrees enacted by Italy from 2005 to 2012; (iii) GSE’s tariff confirmation letters
and the GSE contracts entered into with respect to each photovoltaic plant receiving the
incentive tariffs; and (iv) the numerous public statements made by Italian Government
officials and Italian Ministerial and other authorities confirming the stability of the
incentive tariffs (see | 601 above). Based on these factors, Claimants claim that when they
invested in Italy, they legitimately expected the incentive tariff rates made available
through the Conto Energia Decrees and the GSE’s tariff confirmation letters and contracts

would be fixed for a 20 year period.

Respondent disputes the basis of Claimants’ claims of legitimate expectations predicated
on the above mentioned four factors. In this regard, Respondent challenges both, the
existence of these factors and the creation of any expectations based on them (see {| 637-

641 above).

Accordingly, the dispute between the Parties is focussed on (i) which of the four factors

listed in 770 above existed when Claimants decided to invest in their nine power plants in

Italy; and (ii) whether any of the factors that existed when Claimants decided to invest in

Italy could create any expectations. The Tribunal shall examine these issues in turn.

The Factors that Existed when Claimants Decided to Invest: With respect to the first
question in { 772 above, the Tribunal notes that since the date of acquisition is different for
different power plants (as reflected in the table in { 768 above), the factors that may have

existed at the date of acquisition each power plant may differ.

   

In this connection, it is undisputed that the first among the four factors in {| 770 above, i.e.,
the EC Directive 2001/77/EC (implemented in Italy by way of Legislative Decree No.
387/2003) and the EC Directive 2009/28/EC (implemented in Italy by way of the Romani

Decree) existed at the time Claimants decided to invest in all of their nine power plants.

With respect to the second factor in { 770 above, i.e., the five Conto Energia Decrees, it is
likewise undisputed that the relevant Conto Energia Decree existed at the time Claimants
decided to invest in the corresponding power plants. The San Marco, Santoro, Lenare,
Campania, Monaci, Rovigo and Fiumicino power plants were covered by the Second
Conto Energia Decree, which had come into existence in February 2007, i.e., prior to
Claimants’ acquisition of these seven power plants (see Section IV.B(2) above). Similarly,
the Rustico and Milana power plants were covered by the Third Conto Energia Decree,
which had come into existence in August 2010, i.e., prior to Claimants’ acquisition of these

two power plants (see Section IV.B(3) above).

With respect to the fourth factor in {| 770 above, i.e., the numerous public statements made
by Italian Government officials and Italian Ministerial and other authorities, the Tribunal
notes that some such public statements were indeed made at the relevant points in time
when the concerned Conto Energia Decree was enacted. For instance, with respect to the
Second Conto Energia, promotions and clarifications were issued, inter alia, by the

155

Government and specifically the Minister of Environment, certain provincial

authorities,”° and government organizations, ’*” as well as the GSE, which released an e-

and made presentations to different audiences from 2007 until 2010.” Like its
predecessor, the Third Conto Energia also received promotions from the federal Ministries
of Economic Development, Foreign Affairs etc.,” the provincial and regional

authorities,”! and from GSE.’

777. It is with respect to the third among the four factors mentioned in { 770 above, i.e., the
GSE tariff confirmation letters and the GSE contracts entered into with the SPVs, that the
situation is different for different power plants. As reflected in the table in { 768 above,
with respect to all power plants except the Fiumicino power plant, the date of acquisition
precedes the dates of the GSE tariff confirmation letter or the date when the GSE contract

was executed. In other words, neither the GSE tariff confirmation letter nor the GSE

contract existed for any of these eight power plants when Claimants decided to invest in
them. The situation is different for the Fiumicino power plant, since the GSE tariff
confirmation letter was issued five days prior to Claimants’ decision to acquire the
shareholding in the SPV operating that plant, i.e, SunEdison Apulia 009 S.r.l. The GSE

Contract, however, post-dates Claimants’ decision to invest in the Fiumicino plant.

Accordingly, for eight of Claimants’ power plants, i.e., all except the Fiumicino plant, any
expectations that Claimants could have had while deciding to invest in them can only be
sourced to three of the four factors mentioned in {| 770 above, i.e., (i) the overall regulatory
framework that existed by virtue of the EC Directive 2001/77/EC (implemented in Italy by
way of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003) and the EC Directive 2009/28/EC (implemented
in Italy by way of the Romani Decree); (ii) the relevant Conto Energia Decree; and (iii) the
public statements made by Italian public officials to promote the incentive tariff regime.
For these eight power plants, Claimants could not have derived or relied upon any
expectations from the GSE letters or contracts that followed Claimants’ investment in these
plants, because the letters and contracts did not exist when Claimants decided to invest in

them.

In light of the above considerations, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’
submission that the Tribunal’s determinations on legitimate expectations should be
common for all of Claimants’ photovoltaic plants, regardless of the timing of investment in
each of them (see {| 604 above). The timing of Claimants’ acquisition of shareholding in
the concerned SPVs becomes important in the Tribunal’s determinations, since the factors
that existed when these acquisitions were made by Claimants differed for different plants.
In this connection, the Tribunal also notes the following three points with respect to
Claimants’ other submissions concerning the GSE letters and contracts and the regime that

existed in Italy when Claimants’ decided to invest.

First, Claimants submit that the Italian regulatory framework was an “integrated and
sequential” one, whereby Italy offered conditions that entailed the performance of
subsequent acts. Thus, according to Claimants, the fact that the GSE letters and contracts
post-dated the investments does not impede the protection of Claimants’ legitimate

expectations based on these overall regulatory conditions. This is also because once an

264

investor applied and satisfied all the requirements under the relevant Conto Energia

Decree, GSE had no discretion but to issue the tariff confirmation letter. (see | 606 above).

Regardless of whether the conditions under the Conto Energia Decrees and the other
regulatory factors that existed in Italy created expectations that were legitimate, it is
important to clarify that this “integrated and sequential” regulatory framework does not
ascribe legal or factual significance to the GSE letters and contracts that post-dated
Claimants’ decision to invest for the Tribunal’s legitimate expectations determination. In
other words, even though the GSE letters and contracts were issued in accordance with the
Conto Energia Decrees that existed when Claimants decided to invest, Claimants’
legitimate expectations cannot be sourced in these letters and contracts, since they did not
exist at the time the decision to invest was made for the first eight of Claimants’ nine

power plants enlisted in {| 768 above.

The Tribunal is also not persuaded by Claimants’ argument about the lack of discretion on
part of GSE while issuing the tariff confirmation letter. The role of GSE under the Conto

Energia Decrees was that of an “implementing body””®

that would, in the words of Mr.
Daniele Bacchiocchi (Head of Photovoltaic Plants’ Investigations and Inspections Unit ),
inter alia, “purchase and resell energy generated by renewable energy plants and to
manage the Conto [Energia] [D]ecrees in accordance with applicable legislation” (see J
121 above).764 The fact that GSE, as a state-owned entity, had no discretion while
implementing the Conto Energia Decrees, even if assumed to be correct, does not imply
that GSE’s letters and contracts that did not exist when Claimants decided to invest in eight
power plants could create any expectations. Further, and in any event, both the Second and
the Third Conto Energia Decrees required the issuance of the tariff confirmation letters
only after GSE verified “compliance with the provisions of this decree”.’° Thus, to the
extent GSE had the authority to check compliance with the provisions of the relevant
Conto Energia Decree, it was not completely devoid of discretion. In this regard, the
Tribunal notes the following testimony of Mr. Bacchiocchi during the Hearing:

See CEX-30, Italian Electrical Energy Authority (“AEEG”) Resolution no. 188/05, 14 September 2005.
First Witness Statement of Mr. Daniele Bacchiocchi, 22 December 2017 (“First Bacchiocchi Witness

Statement”), 4 17.

GSE was not oblige to execute anything. We were just obliged to issue an
administrative act if the plant met all the necessary requirements.

But the GSE was not obliged to enter into any contract. We were obliged to
grant the incentives if the plants met_and complied with all the requirements.
This is the only obligation that the law imposed on the GSE.’ (emphasis
added)

 

Second, and on a related note, the Tribunal considers that Claimants’ allegation that the
delay in the issuance of the tariff confirmation letters and/or the execution of the GSE
contracts was attributable to “bureaucratic delay” misses the point (see § 606 above). As
mentioned above, GSE’s role as the implementing body under the Conto Energia Decrees
and any delays that it may have encountered while performing such role is irrelevant to the
factual question of whether the GSE tariff confirmation letters and contracts existed when

Claimants decided to invest in the concerned photovoltaic plant.

Third, the Tribunal also does not consider it relevant that the GSE contracts, once executed
with respect to eight of the nine power plants in consideration (all except the Fiumicino
plant), defined the “effective date” as the date of entry into operation of the concerned
plant.” The fact that the GSE contracts backdated the effective date to the date of entry
into operation of the plant does not alter the factual conclusion that the said GSE contracts
did not exist when Claimants decided to invest. Thus, Claimants could not have relied

upon these contracts while making the decision to invest in the concerned power plants.

Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that while deciding to invest in the first eight of
Claimants’ nine power plants enlisted in § 768 above, Claimants did and could only have
relied upon the three factors mentioned in { 778 above, and not on GSE’s tariff
confirmation letters and the contracts. Thus, for the purpose of the analysis that will follow
to determine Claimants’ expectations and the legitimacy thereof, the Tribunal shall not

examine the GSE letters and contracts for these eight power plants.

As mentioned in 777 above, the situation is different for the Fiumicino power plant, since
Claimants’ acquisition of this plant post-dated GSE’s tariff confirmation letter.
Accordingly, Claimants could have relied upon this letter while deciding to make their
investment. In light of this, the Tribunal’s forthcoming analysis with respect to any
legitimate expectations that existed for Claimants to invest in the Fiumicino plant will be

conducted separately.

The Scope of Claimants’ Expectations: The Tribunal shall next answer the second question
in { 772 above, i.e., what expectations, if any, the factors mentioned in { 778 above could
create for investors to decide to invest in the Italian photovoltaic market. In this regard, the
Tribunal shall first examine the scope of the expectations created by the three factors,
which existed while Claimants invested in the first eight power plants enlisted in { 768
above. This shall be followed by the same question being answered with respect to the

Fiumicino power plant, for which the GSE tariff confirmation letter also existed as a factor.

To recall, the three factors that Claimants did and could have relied on while investing in
the first eight plants enlisted in {768 above were (i) Italy’s overall regulatory framework
in the photovoltaic sector aimed at meeting EU targets for renewable energy, in particular
in the EC Directive 2001/77/EC (implemented in Italy by way of Legislative Decree No.
387/2003) and the EC Directive 2009/28/EC (implemented in Italy by way of the Romani
Decree); (ii) the Second and/or the Third Conto Energia Decrees as relevant; and (iii) the
public statements made by Italian Governmental, Ministerial and other authorities
confirming the stability of the incentive tariffs. In order to determine Claimants’ claims,
the question to be examined is whether these three factors could come together to create an
expectation that the incentive tariff rates made available to Claimants’ power plants would

be fixed for a 20 year period.
The Tribunal answers this question in the negative. This is for the following five reasons.

First, and at the outset, the Tribunal notes that the structure of the Conto Energia Decrees
reflects that photovoltaic producers’ entitlement to incentive tariffs was not automatic, and
could therefore not be assumed in the absence the GSE tariff confirmation letters and/or

the GSE contracts.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

In this regard, the Tribunal takes the Second Conto Energia as an example. First, within 60
days as of the commencement of operation of the plant (90 days in the case of the Third
Conto Energia), the plant operator had to send to the GSE its application for the “pertinent
incentive tariff, together with final documentation” and “[flailure to comply with the
deadlines under this paragraph involve[d] inadmissibility to the incentive tariffs under
article 6.” Second, within 60 days (or 120 days as was the case with the Third Conto
Energia) of the date of receipt of this application from the plant operator, GSE had to
“verify compliance with the provisions of this [D]ecree and in consideration of the
provisions of article 6” notify the plant operator of the exact tariff awarded.” Third, it is
only after these provisions appear in the Conto Energia Decree that it discusses the
“entitlement period” and in this regard states that the “tariff identified . . . is awarded for a
period of twenty years commencing from the date of entry into operation of the plant and
shall remain constant in current currency for the entire twenty year period.”’” Thus, the
incentive tariff is spoken about in terms of an entitlement that has to be “awarded”; not one

that is automatically available upon entry into operation of a power plant.

Accordingly, Claimants’ characterization of the Conto Energia regime, as a conjunctive
legislative and contractual mechanism which qualifies as “a single unified act that Italy

guaranteed investors under its regulatory regime”””!

is inappropriate. Moreover, Claimants’
characterization goes against Claimants’ own admission that “the Conto Energia [D]ecrees
themselves did not automatically convey a specific right on any particular investor”, but
instead “established the specific regime to which investors would be entitled if the
investors met various technical and construction criteria.”””* Thus, Claimants recognize
that merely based on the Conto Energia Decrees in existence at the time they invested,
they could not have expected a feed-in tariff to automatically be available and to last for a

period of 20 years.

Second, it is also important to examine the Conto Energia Decrees in the correct
hierarchical context. In this regard, the Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s
characterization of the Conto Energia Decrees as secondary rules, which should be
understood in the context of the hierarchically superordinate rules they implement, i.e., the
Legislative Decree 387/2003, which implemented the EC Directive 2001/77/EC and the
Romani Decree, which implemented the EC Directive 2009/28/EC (see {| 640 above).

Claimants also do not deny that the Conto Energia Decrees were “well-crafted response
to” the objectives laid down in the EC Directives, and “respected the principles” under
Legislative Decree 387/2003 and the Romani Decree.””> Claimants’ own expert on Italian
law, Prof. Antonio D’Atena, has alluded to this “‘hierarchical’ position of the relevant
sources of law (eg: law, law decree, legislative decree, regulation)”, wherein he
characterizes the Conto Energia Decrees as ministerial decrees that constitution
“regulatory measures” that fall below “legislative measures” such as Legislative Decree

No. 387/2003.74

Of particular relevance for the present case is Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, which was
implemented by the first three Conto Energia Decrees, the Second and Third Conto
Energia Decrees being directly relevant for Claimants’ photovoltaic plants. The text of
these Conto Energia Decrees clearly evidences their purpose as interdepartmental or
ministerial decrees intended to implement the framework regime of the Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003. For instance, the Second Conto Energia Decree starts with the following
statements in its preamble:

Considering that article 7(1) of [L]egislative [D]ecree no. 387, 29 December

2003, implementing European [D]irective 2001/77/EC on the promotion of

electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity

market, provides that the Minister for productive activities, in concert with the

Minister for the environment and the protection of territory, in agreement with

the Joint Conference (Conferenza Unificata), shall adopt one or more decrees

defining criteria to promote the production of electricity from solar energy
sources;

Considering that article 7(2) sub-paragraph d) of [L]egislative [D]ecree no.
387, 29 December 2003, provides that criteria for the promotion of electricity
produced by means of the photovoltaic conversion of solar sources shall

include a specific incentive tariff, in a decreasing amount and for a term

guaranteeing fair remuneration of investment and operation costs;””>

Thereafter, Article 1 of the Second Conto Energia Decree defines the “purpose” of the
Decree as defining “the criteria and procedures for the promotion of the production of
electricity by photovoltaic plants in implementation of article 7 of [L]egislative [D]ecree
no. 387, 29 December 2003.”””° Similar recitals and definitions exist in the First and Third

Conto Energia Decrees as well.’”

Going a step further, the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, which followed Law No.
39/2002, was itself enacted in implementation of the EC Directive 2001/77/EC, and should
thus be understood in conjunction with these two legal instruments. The EC Directive
2001/77/EC spoke about setting “national indicative targets” for each Member State’s
consumption of energy through renewable sources, keeping in mind the global target of
12% by 2010,’”® whereunder Italy was ascribed the reference value for a national

indicative target of 25%.’” (see {| 104-107 above).’°°

Law No. 39/2002 and the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 were enacted as steps towards
implementing these objectives, and while they envisaged incentive schemes, these Decrees
delegated the specificities of these incentive schemes to various Ministries while noting
that the incentives should be cost-efficient and not create greater or new burdens on the

State budget (see {| 107 and 113 above).7*!

1. Within six months from the date of entry into force of this decree, the
Minister of Productive Activities, in consultation with the Minister of
Environment and Protection of Natural Resources, in consultation with
the Joint Conference, shall adopt one or more decrees which define the
criteria to encourage the production of electricity from solar sources.

2. The criteria referred to in paragraph 1, which shall impose no new cost to
the state budget and shall be in compliance with Community legislation
currently in force, shall:

a) establish the requirements of the subjects that may benefit from
incentives;

b) establish the minimum technical requirements of the eligible
components and systems;

c) — establish the conditions for the accumulation of the new incentives
with other incentives;

d) — establish the modalities for determining the scope of incentives. For
electricity produced by photovoltaic conversion of solar energy,
provide a specific incentive rate, decreasing amount and duration as
to ensure fair remuneration of each investment and operating costs;

e) — establish a target for the nominal power to be installed;

f) agree also with the upper limit of the cumulative electric power of
all plants that can receive the incentive;

g) may include the use of green certificates allocated to the Manager
of the grid in Article 11 paragraph 3, second sentence of the
legislative decree 16 March 1999 n. 79.75

800. The Tribunal considers the hierarchical set-up to be clearly evidenced from the above
provision, inasmuch as it (i) delegates the function of defining specific criteria for
incentive regimes to the Ministries mentioned in Article 7(1); (ii) states, in Article 7(2),
that the criteria shall be in compliance with EC legislation; and (iii) states, in Article 7(2),
that the criteria shall not impose any new costs on to the State budget. The above three
elements indicate that the criteria for incentives vis-a-vis photovoltaic facilities that would
be established by the concerned Ministries would be subject to EC legislation and to the
Italian State budget. In other words, these criteria could undergo alterations upon
recommendations of the EC, such as the proposals the EC was authorized to make under
782 CEX-27, Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, 29 December 2003, article 7. As mentioned in f.n. 52 above,
Respondent’s translation of article 7 of the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 varies from Claimants’. Specifically,

Respondent uses the term “fair return” instead of “fair remuneration”, which usage is disputed between the Parties.
The Tribunal shall resolve this disputed matter in the forthcoming paragraphs of this Section.

use Claimants’ preferred ion, i.e., “fair ion”, noticing that

EC Directive No. 2001/77/EC (see {| 797 above), or upon the incentive scheme imposing

any costs on the State budget.

Third, it is important to note that Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 or Law No. 39/2002,
and the EC Directive 2001/77/EC made no mention of a 20 year period during which
incentive schemes, such as tariffs were to remain constant. The only thing that Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003 mentioned about the “modalities for determining the scope of
incentives” was that photovoltaic energy producers that qualify as recipients of such
incentives would be entitled to “a specific incentive rate, decreasing amount and duration
as to ensure fair remuneration of each investment and operating costs”.’*? (emphasis
added) The emphasised phrase is disputed between the Parties, both in terms of its

translation and its implication.

According to Claimants, “[rJeturns can only be assessed in hindsight, after the actual costs
and performance of a facility are known. Remuneration, on the other hand, generally is
established or agreed ex ante, with the returns on any particular project flowing as a
function of the remuneration, costs, and performance of the projects.””** According to
Respondent, under Article 7(2) of the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, “remuneration of
the investment, through the grant of incentives, was thus functionally linked . . . to the
costs suffered by the investors, thus requiring that such incentives be always parameterized
on the progressive reduction of such costs, due to technological development and scale

economies.”7°5

The Tribunal considers that not much turns on the use of the term “remuneration” versus
“return”.’8© The Tribunal, however, considers that Claimants read more into this
stipulation, i.e., “fair remuneration” than warranted. Assuming that the term
“remuneration” is a more accurate translation of the Italian original than the term “return”,

that alone cannot imply that the incentive scheme being discussed in Legislative Decree

No. 387/2003, and later codified in the Conto Energia Decrees, is set in stone such that it
cannot be subsequently modified by the Italian Government. In this regard, the Tribunal
agrees with Respondent that “[t]he theory of the Claimants that Italy had promised fixed
tariffs that could not have been modified by even a cent . . . would read a stabilisation
clause into a legislation that in fact says exactly the opposite, because it includes the

parameters under which incentives could be remodulated.””8’

As mentioned in { 800 above, the Tribunal considers that Article 7(2) of Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003 includes elements that indicate that the criteria for the incentive
scheme to be established thereunder could undergo modifications. Moreover, the structure
of the Conto Energia Decrees, discussed in {| 790-792 above, indicates that the
entitlement to any incentive scheme is not automatic, but is subject to compliance with the

conditions within these Decrees.

In light of the above regulatory and structural framework, the Tribunal considers it
important to examine the provisions in the Conto Energia Decrees, which provides that
the “tariff identified . . . is awarded for a period of twenty years commencing from the date
of entry into operation of the plant and shall remain constant in current currency for the
entire twenty year period.”’** Apart from the fact that this provision already indicates that
the incentive tariffs are not automatically available to photovoltaic plant operators but are
“awarded” (see § 790 above), the Tribunal considers that this provision cannot be read as a

guarantee that incentive tariffs, once awarded, will remain unchanged for a 20 year period.

In this regard, Respondent argues that the provision in the Second and Third Conto
Energia Decrees stating that the tariffs “shall remain constant in current currency for the
entire twenty year period” should be juxtaposed against the contrary stipulation in the First
Conto Energia Decree, which permitted inflation-related adjustments to tariffs. The

Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s argument.

The Tribunal notes that the above quoted stipulations from the Second and Third Conto

Energia Decrees were not included in the First Conto Energia, which provided instead that

“[rJevisions to the incentive tariffs . . . will be carried out for each of the years subsequent
to 2006, in accordance with the annual rate of variation, for the previous twelve months, in
the consumer price index for blue and white-collar worker families recorded by Istat.””*
Both Parties recognize that this stipulation indicated that the incentive tariff amounts could

be adjusted for inflation calculated according to the ISTAT index (see {| 120 above).’”°

808. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the phrase “constant in current currency for the
entire twenty year period” is indicative of the fact that the incentive tariffs awarded
pursuant to these Decrees were not subject to modifications based on inflation rates. This
understanding is also confirmed by a report of the Italian Federation for Rational Use of
Energy.”*! Further, the Tribunal understands the reference to a 20 year period in the Conto
Energia Decrees to be an indication of the average conventional or useful lifecycle of

photovoltaic plants, which is not a disputed proposition between the Parties.”

809. Consequently, the phrase “shall remain constant in current currency for the entire twenty
year period” should be understood as a confirmation that the incentive tariff rates granted
for the average conventional life of photovoltaic plants, once awarded, will not be subject
to inflation-related adjustments. However, they may be modified subsequently, as long as
the “remuneration” that photovoltaic plant operators receive for the average life of their
plant is “fair” in the given circumstances, in accordance with Article 7(2) of the Legislative

Decree No. 387/2003.

810. The above reading of the Conto Energia Decrees is also in tune with the hierarchical
context within which these Decrees should be understood, i.e., as ministerial decrees that
implement the broader regulatory framework provided in the Legislative Decree No.
387/2003 (see {| 793-800 above). Even the Italian Constitutional Court understood the

Conto Energia Decrees in this light, in the following passages of its Decision No. 16/2017:

Article 7 of Decree 387/2003 — which is entitled “ Specific provision for solar
energies” — takes into account the production of electricity through
photovoltaic conversion of solar energy and entrusts to “ one or more decrees”
of the Ministers of Productive activities and of Environment, having heard the
advice of the State/Regions conference, the determination of the criteria for the
incentives in order to “guarantee a fair remuneration of the costs of investment
and management” .

The decrees that have been issued on the basis of said article 7 are known as
“conti energia” and are progressively numbered in accordance with the various,
subsequent, versions which have enacted five different procedures of support.

It must be said that, in the context of such general normative framework, the
enforcement of systems of incentives to renewable energies is characterized by
long-term stability in order to ensure certainty for investors.

However, the guarantee of stability of the incentive for all the due period does

not imply, however, as a necessary consequence, that the measure should

remain unchanged for 20 years, unchanged and unaffected by the variations

which are common to long-term contract.’>
Fourth, on a related note, the Parties have also discussed the implications of Article 24 of
the Romani Decree, i.e., the Legislative Decree No. 28/2011 (quoted in its relevant part in
{| 147 above), which implemented the EC Directive 2009/28/EC. The Tribunal notes that
the Romani Decree is not directly relevant to the present case, since Claimants’
photovoltaic plants were covered by the Second and Third Conto Energia Decrees, which
were enacted in implementation of the Romani Decree’s predecessor, i.e., Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003. The Romani Decree was implemented by the Fourth and Fifth Conto
Energia Decrees (see Sections IV.B(5) and IV.B(6) above).

Accordingly, for the purposes of the current analysis, it suffices to state that a number of
similar considerations that applied to the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 also apply to the
Romani Decree. These include (i) the hierarchical subordination of the Conto Energia
Decrees that implemented the Romani Decree by virtue of a delegation to various
Ministries contained in the Romani Decree (see { 149 above); (ii) the fact that the Romani

Decree was enacted in implementation of European law, namely the EC Directive

2009/28/EC (see J 147 above); (iii) the stipulation, in Article 24, that incentive schemes
would have “the purpose of ensuring a fair remuneration of the investment and operating
costs”, the translation and implication of which stipulation is likewise disputed between the
Parties (see {{ 149 above);”* and (iv) the provision that “[nJo further or higher burden on

the State budget shall derive from the application of” the Romani Decree.”

The above factors indicate to the Tribunal that the Romani Decree, like its predecessor, i.e.,
the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, contained a scope for re-modulation of the incentive
tariff regime, so long as the incentive regime ensured the purpose of a fair remuneration to
the investors. Indeed, Italy’s National Action Plan, which preceded the Romani Decree,
had specifically stated that the incentive tariff scheme “is subject to regular adjustments
which take into account the trends in the prices of energy products and components for
photovoltaic plants . . ., with the intention of limiting the medium- and long-term costs to

the community”””® (see {| 146 above).

On a related note, the Tribunal is also persuaded by Respondent’s submission that
legislations such as the Romani Decree or the prior-in-time Salva Alcoa Decree are itself
proof that the incentive tariff regime was subject to future modifications.””’ As mentioned
in { 130 above, the Salva Alcoa Decree, i.e., Legislative Decree No. 3/2010 was enacted on
25 January 2010 and it extended the Second Conto Energia tariffs to the plants that were
built by 31 December 2010, but connected to the grid later, i-e., until 30 June 2011.
Regardless of the motivations behind the Salva Alcoa Decree and whether or not the same
benefitted Claimants in some manner, which are disputed issues between the Parties, the
Tribunal considers the Salva Alcoa Decree relevant as an indication of modifications to the
regulatory regime regarding incentive tariffs. Similarly, the Romani Decree is also an
example of a regulatory modification to the incentive tariff regime, inasmuch as it
amended the regime by (i) limiting the deadline for Third Conto Energia tariffs to plants

that were connected to the grid by 31 May 2011, as opposed to the originally envisaged

deadline of 31 December 2013; and added further conditions to the eligibility of plants that

received incentive tariffs (see J 150 above).’%

The Tribunal is not convinced by Claimants’ argument that the Romani Decree and the
Salva Alcoa Decree are not comparable to the Spalma-incentivi Decree, since the latter was
an impermissible retroactive modification whereas the former two decrees applied
prospectively.’”° There was no indication in either the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 or
the Romani Decree, or the Conto Energia Decrees enacted in implementation thereof, that
any modifications to the regulatory regime concerning incentive tariffs cannot apply to
plants already in operation. Moreover, the fact that the modifications applied to plants in
existence does not render them retroactive in application, since such modifications fell

within Italy’s regulatory regime.

Fifth, with respect to the various public statements made by Italian Government officials
and Italian Ministerial and other authorities, which is the last factor that Claimants rely on
for their legitimate expectations claim (see {| 776 above), the Tribunal is persuaded by
Respondent’s submission. Respondent rightly submits that such public statements were
only intended to reiterate the regime that existed by virtue of the legislative and the Conto
Energia Decrees (see { 641 above). Given that the overall regulatory regime in Italy,
including the Conto Energia Decrees, did not create expectations of the incentive tariffs
being fixed in time for 20 years, the public statements corresponding to this regulatory

regime could also not have created such an expectation.

While that general statements can create legitimate expectations in theory (see [| 699-703
above), the general statements made to the public in order to advertise a particular
regulatory regime can only create expectations, if any, that are in line with the regulatory
regime itself. These public statements cannot bind the State to commitments above and

beyond the legal regime in existence.

In any event, the Tribunal is also persuaded by Respondent’s argument that a perusal of

these public statements shows that many of them did not specifically contain any evident

SoRy, {if 435-437.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

promise of the exact incentive tariff amounts being fixed for 20 years. For instance, the
most discussed public statement, i.e., of the Minister of Environment, spoke about the State
recognizing “an incentive that balances widely initial investment”, or the “system”
guaranteeing a “sure income for 20 years” for photovoltaic producers.* These
articulations are synonymous with the regulatory prescription of a “fair remuneration” in
the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and the subsequent Romani Decree.*”! Similarly, the
statements by provincial government authorities that did mention the Conto Energia
regime, while discussing the tariffs being constant for 20 years, specifically clarified the
meaning of “constant” as referring to “no integration . . . at the rate of inflation”.°* Even
GSE’s presentations, reports or publications spoke about the tariffs being “constant” in
terms of “current currency”, i.e., “not subject to updates ISTAT”,®® and/or clarified GSE’s

role in the multi-step process of receiving incentive tariffs.°°*

819. Consequently, in light of the above considerations, the Tribunal considers that none of the
three factors relied upon by Claimants (see {| 778 above) for the first eight of their nine
photovoltaic plants enlisted in { 768 above, created an expectation that the incentive tariff
rates made available through the Conto Energia Decrees and the GSE’s tariff confirmation
letters and contracts would be fixed for a 20 year period. The only expectation that
Claimants could have had while acquiring the shareholding of the concerned SPVs was

that their power plants, once they were declared to qualify for the incentive scheme within

the Second and/or Third Conto Energia regime, would be ensured a “fair remuneration”
for the average conventional life of photovoltaic plants (20 years), in accordance with the

Legislative Decree No. 387/2003.

With respect to Claimants’ ninth power plant, i.e., the Fiumicino power plant, as
mentioned in {| 777 and 786 above, the situation was slightly different than for the
remaining eight power plants. This is because Claimants’ acquisition of the Fiumicino
plant post-dated GSE’s tariff confirmation letter awarding the incentive tariff to the SPV
operating the plant. Thus, Claimants could not only have relied on the three factors
mentioned in {| 778 above while deciding to invest in the Fiumicino plant, but could also
have relied on a fourth factor, namely the GSE tariff confirmation letter. With respect to
the three factors mentioned in {| 778 above, the Tribunal’s determination in J 818 above
applies equally to the Fiumicino plant. However, only for the purposes of the Fiumicino
power plant, the Tribunal is required to additionally determine the value of the GSE tariff
confirmation letter, in order to decide whether it could have created any legitimate

expectations of the incentive tariff rate being fixed for a 20 year period.

The Tribunal is of the view that even for the Fiumicino power plant, despite the GSE tariff
confirmation letter, Claimants’ expectations could not go beyond being entitled to a fair
remuneration, in accordance with the stipulation in the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003.
In this connection, the Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s submission that the
instruments created by GSE, i.e., the GSE tariff confirmation letters and the contracts, were
of an “accessory” nature (see { 638 above).

The term “accessory” denotes that these instruments were issued by GSE as accessories to
public acts, as distinct from instruments that could create binding contractual obligations.
The concept of accessory contracts was explained by Claimants’ expert, Prof. D’Atena,

during the hearing:

THE CHAIRMAN: What’s an “accessory contract”? Is that an administrative
law motion or a civil law notion? For me it’s new, I admit it.

A. Administrative law, an accessory contract which is accessory to an
administrative concession.

THE CHAIRMAN: In what respect does it differ from an ordinary private law
contract, an accessory contract under administrative law?

A. This is a kind of scientific concept which was explored in Italy in the past.

According to this interpretation there are certain contracts that, despite the fact

that they have a private law form, they are subject to the logic of administrative

law because they are ancillary to an administrative concession.”
Further, the Tribunal is also convinced by Respondent’s Italian law expert, Prof. Anna
Romano’s emphasis on a characteristic feature of such accessory contracts, i.e., “the close
interdependence between the administrative measure and the [accessory instrument]”, such
that the “the primary source” of the obligation is the administrative measure, whereas the
accessory instrument is a secondary regulatory tool.8°° In the Tribunal’s view, this
characteristic feature implies that the accessory instruments, i.e., the GSE letters and/or
contracts in the present case, cannot create any commitments or expectations above and
beyond the administrative or public acts that they are sourced in, i.e., the Legislative

Decree No. 387/2003 and the Second and Third Conto Energia Decrees in the present case.

The Tribunal considers instruments issued by GSE to qualify as such accessory
instruments under Italian law, on the basis of two related factors that provide the

appropriate context in which to consider these letters.

Firstly, the nature and role of GSE as an “implementing body” under the Conto Energia
regime implies that GSE acts in a purely executory role in this regime. GSE is a state-
owned company, whose sole shareholder is the Ministry for Economy and Finance, and it
is the successor of GRTN, which was established under the Legislative Decree No.
79/1999 (see { 102 above). It was defined as the “implementing body” by Italian Electrical
Energy Authority’s Resolution No. 188/05 (see { 121 above).®°” In this regard, the Tribunal
also considers it appropriate to rely on Respondent’s witness, Mr. Daniele Bacchiocchi’s
description of GSE’s role, since he is the Head of Photovoltaic Investigations and

Inspections Unit at GSE. According to his testimony, “GSE’s main role is to promote and

support the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, to purchase and resell
energy generated by renewable energy plants and to manage the Conto [Energia]

[D]ecrees in accordance with applicable legislation” (see {| 782 above).°°*

826. The Conto Energia Decrees also recognize GSE’s role as an implementing body, and
assign responsibilities to GSE in order to implement the Conto Energia Decrees.*” In this
connection, too, the testimony of Mr. Bacchiocchi is relevant:

Q. When the Conto Energia decree says that the GSE is an implementing
body, what is your understanding -- if you have one -- of what that means?

A. As I said at the beginning, the implementing body is the body that has
been identified by the decree in order to implement everything that is
necessary so that the decree can be implemented, made effective.

So the GSE, for example, as I said before, dealt with the validation of the
applications, inspections; it made available the remote platform to send the
incentive applications; it deals with payments. So it completely manages this
mechanism on the basis of what is written in the decree and in the general
rules of this mechanism.*!?

827. Secondly, the Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s reliance on the Italian Constitutional
Court Decision No. 16/2017 (see Section IV.G(2) above), which characterized the
agreements entered into by GSE as “accessory to the provisions granting the incentives” as
opposed to “private law contracts”.*!! This opinion of the Constitutional Court Decision
No. 16/2017 has also received endorsement of investment arbitration tribunals, in
particular, the tribunals in CEF v. Italy and Belenergia v. Italy. The tribunal in CEF v. Italy
found, while relying on the above findings of the Italian Constitutional Court, that due to
the peculiar nature of the GSE contracts, they were “as a matter of Italian law subject to
unilateral modification”.*!? Similarly, the tribunal in Belenergia v. Italy stated in this
regard that “the GSE as part of Public Administration has acted in a position of supremacy
exercising public powers when concluding and modifying the GSE Conventions in light of

Italian regulatory and legislative framework, leading to jurisdiction of Italian
administrative courts to discuss this. Hence, the Tribunal cannot agree . . . that the GSE
Conventions could have contained specific commitments addressed specifically to

Belenergia.”*'3

While the above findings were rendered in the context of the contracts that GSE executed
with photovoltaic plant operators, the Tribunal considers that these findings apply equally
to the GSE tariff confirmation letters. If the GSE contracts are characterized as acts
accessory to administrative acts, there is no reason to not qualify GSE’s tariff confirmation

letters similarly.

In this connection, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ and Claimants’ expert,
Prof. D’Atena’s criticisms of the Italian Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 and of
Italy’s position in this arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal notes the following points in

this connection.

(i) Claimants’ and Prof. D’Atena’s reliance on the Romani Decree’s description of the
GSE contracts as “private law agreements” does not persuade this Tribunal.*"4 In this
regard, the Tribunal is convinced by Respondent’s Italian law expert, Prof. Anna
Romano’s opinion that the Romani Decree’s use of the phrase “private law
agreements” is not directly relevant to the present case, since Claimants’ photovoltaic
plants were covered by the Second and Third Conto Energia Decrees, which were
enacted to implement Romani Decree’s predecessor, i.e., the Legislative Decree No.
387/2003.8!5 Moreover, the Italian Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 took
this provision in the Romani Decree into account, and still characterized the GSE
contracts as “accessory” to administrative or public acts, in light of the public or

social interests involved.*!®

(ii) Further, Prof. D’Atena, during the Hearing, described accessory contracts as being

subject to the logic of administrative law, “despite the fact that they have a private

law form” (see { 822 above). Thus, the form of the instrument in question is not as
important as the logic or context behind the same. In this connection, the Tribunal is
persuaded by Prof. Romano’s opinion that the “interdependence between the
administrative measure and the ancillary [GSE] agreement” and the fact that “the
content of the agreement is totally predetermined by law”, evidence the accessory
nature of GSE letters and contracts.*!’ In the face of these contextual features, the

8

form of the GSE letters and contracts, which Claimants emphasise,*! is not a

material feature in consideration.

Similarly, the fact that the Italian Procurer General, in his brief to the Constitutional

519 also does not convince

Court, described GSE contracts as private law contracts,
this Tribunal. The Tribunal, instead, considers the Italian Constitutional Court’s
understanding of Italian law to prevail over the Italian Procurer General’s submission

before the Court.

Lastly, the Tribunal does not consider the Italian Constitutional Court’s findings,
quoted in {| 827 above, to be unclear.*”° The Tribunal considers the Constitutional
Court’s findings to be sufficiently clear, and this clarity is evidenced by its
endorsement in investment arbitration jurisprudence. In the face of the clear findings
of the Constitutional Court, the Tribunal does not consider Prof. D’Atena’s criticisms
of the Constitutional Court based on the Italian principle of horizontal subsidiarity to

warrant a different conclusion.**!

830. In light of the above considerations, the Tribunal considers that the GSE tariff confirmation

letter that was issued to the Fiumicino power plant prior to Claimants’ investment therein

was merely an accessory instrument that could not have created any expectations beyond

what the overall regulatory regime had created. These expectations have already been

delineated by the Tribunal in J 818 above. To recall, the only expectation that Claimants

had, and could have relied upon, while deciding to invest in Italy was that their power

plants, once they were declared to qualify for the incentive scheme within the Second
and/or Third Conto Energia regime, would be ensured a “fair remuneration” for the
average conventional life of photovoltaic plants (20 years), in accordance with the
Legislative Decree No. 387/2003. The GSE tariff confirmation letter issued to the
Fiumicino plant, while being a manifestation of the power plant having qualified for the
incentive scheme within the Second Conto Energia Decree, does not have any implications

on the scope of the expectations of a “fair remuneration”.

831. As an incidental matter, the Tribunal notes that Respondent does not specifically dispute
that Claimants did, in fact, place reliance upon the regulatory regime in existence while
deciding to invest in Italy. In this connection, although Respondent challenges the
adequacy of Claimants’ due diligence prior to deciding to invest in Italy (see { 655 above),
the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent’s allegations. In particular, the Tribunal does
not agree with Respondent’s assertion that, based on a statement in a due diligence report
prepared by the law firm, Gianni, Orrigoni, Grippo & Partners, which provided that “the
photovoltaic energy industry is highly regulated”,*** Claimants should have conducted
further investigations.*?* There is ample evidence of due diligence reports that Claimants
had obtained from various reputed law firms with respect to each of their photovoltaic
power plant, which convinces the Tribunal that the threshold of reasonable due diligence

was satisfied (see [J 192, 196, 198, 201 and 204 above).°7*

832. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that Claimants could have, and did rely upon, the
expectation that their power plants, once they were declared to qualify for the incentive

scheme within the Second and/or Third Conto Energia regime, would be ensured a “fair

remuneration” for the average conventional life of photovoltaic plants (20 years), in

accordance with the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003.

Whether Claimants’ Expectations Satisfy the Threshold of Legitimacy

 

Having determined the scope of Claimants’ expectations that existed when they decided to
invest in Italy, the Tribunal next examines whether these expectations satisfy the threshold

of legitimacy.

In this connection, at the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Parties, through their experts on
Italian law, have advanced propositions relating to the threshold of legitimate expectations
under Italian and European laws, in particular while criticizing the Italian Constitutional
Court Decision No. 16/2017.*?° However, the Tribunal considers it important to clarify that
the standard of legitimate expectations that it is required to, and consequently will, apply is
the standard in international law. The applicable law to this issue of frustration of
legitimate expectations, and whether or not the same amounts to a breach of the FET
standard under Article 10(1) ECT, is international law, pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT.
Accordingly, the standard against which the legitimacy of Claimants’ expectations and
propriety of Italy’s conduct shall be examined is the one that emanates from international

law.

With respect to the standard of legitimacy of an investor’s expectations, the Tribunal has
already discerned the same above (see {{| 697-714 above). In particular, the question to be
examined is whether Claimants’ expectations of ensured a “fair remuneration” in respect of
their photovoltaic power plants (see {| 830 above) rise to the requisite level of legitimacy
and reasonableness in light of the circumstances (see { 697 above). This requires looking
into whether Claimants’ alleged expectations were in the form of mere subjective hopes or
beliefs, or were objectively knowable and certain (see {710 above). Only in the latter

situation will the expectations be considered legitimate.

The Tribunal considers that Claimants’ expectations of a fair remuneration for the average

conventional life of photovoltaic plants (20 years) do not satisfy the threshold of objective

certainty for the first eight of Claimants’ nine power plants enlisted in § 768 above. In this
regard, the Tribunal recalls that it is accepted in investment arbitration jurisprudence that
for any expectations to be protected, such expectations should be “based on more than
subjective beliefs”,*° and the assessment of whether they are must be based on
information that was, or should have been, known at the time the decision to invest was
made. This is an objective standard for assessing the legitimacy of expectations, to ensure

that merely subjective hopes and beliefs are not protected (see {{{| 708-710 above).*”’

For the first eight of Claimants’ nine power plants enlisted in § 768 above, as already
determined above, Claimants’ SPVs had not received the GSE tariff confirmation letters,
nor was there any contract in existence between GSE and the concerned SPVs (see {| 777-
778 above). The absence of these documents, in particular the GSE tariff confirmation
letters, necessarily implies that Claimants had no way of being objectively certain that they
would qualify so as to be awarded the incentive tariffs under the incentive regime in the

Conto Energia Decrees.

Further, as determined in {| 790-792 above, the entitlement to the incentive scheme in the
Conto Energia regime was not automatic, in the sense that an application had to be made to
GSE with requisite documentation, and only upon verification of the documentation being
complete and the criteria in the Conto Energia Decree being complied with, would GSE
award a particular incentive tariff to the power plant operator. Even the entitlement to a
“fair remuneration” under Article 7(2) of the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 was
available only to such photovoltaic plants that would fall within the “criteria” established
by the Ministries that were responsible for codifying such criteria under Article 7(1) of the
Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 (see {| 799-809 above). In other words, the protection of
the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 was also only available after the candidacy of the

photovoltaic plant in question had been approved as per the applicable Conto Energia

Decree.

Since the first eight of Claimants’ nine power plants enlisted in { 768 above did not have
GSE’s tariff confirmation letters before Claimants decided to invest in them, Claimants’
expectations of a fair remuneration vis-a-vis these power plants do not meet the requisite
threshold of objective certainty, and in turn, do not meet the standard of legitimacy in order
to be protected under Article 10(1) ECT. Accordingly, Claimants’ claims for a frustration
of their legitimate expectations under Article 10(1) ECT is rejected with respect to these

eight power plants.

With respect to the Fiumicino power plant, as mentioned above (see {| 777-779 above),
Claimants acquisition of the operating SPV, SunEdison Apulia 009 S.r.l., was dated 22
June 2011,%*8 at a point in time when the power plant had already been issued a tariff
confirmation letter by GSE on 17 June 2011.**? By way of this tariff confirmation letter,
GSE “hereby communicate[d] the admission to the incentive tariff under [the Second
Conto Energia Decree}”.**° Accordingly, Claimants did objectively know and were certain
that they were admitted into the incentive regime of the Second Conto Energia Decree.
Since this admission into the incentive regime pre-dated Claimants’ decision to invest in
the Fiumicino power plant, Claimants’ expectation of a fair remuneration for the average
conventional life of photovoltaic plants (20 years) satisfies the threshold of objective
knowledge and certainty. Accordingly, Claimants’ expectation of a fair remuneration with

respect to the Fiumicino power plant satisfies the threshold of legitimacy.

Frustrated Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations of a “Fair
Remuneration”

Decree as a “remodulation” of the existing regulatory regime in Italy (see § 258 above),
whereas Claimants contend that the Spalma-incentivi Decree had a “dramatic impact” on

their investments (see {| 275 above).

The changes brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree in the incentive tariff regime,
and in particular the three options that it offered the photovoltaic plant operators, are
discussed in detail in Section IV.G(1) above. Additional aspects of the Spalma-incentivi
Decree, pertaining to alterations in the payment modalities, the Administrative
Management Fee and options granted to photovoltaic plant operators to, inter alia, obtain
loans, are also discussed in Section IV.G(1) above. Although Claimants did not make a
choice amongst the three options that the Spalma-incentivi Decree, they claim that the
default option assigned to them, i.e., the third option (see { 261 above) taken together with

the change in payment modalities, frustrated their legitimate expectations.

The Tribunal has delineated the scope of Claimants’ legitimate expectations in the previous
Section, and found that Claimants could only have relied upon any legitimate expectations
with respect to one of their plants, i.e., the Fiumicino power plant. Accordingly, the only
question that is left for the Tribunal to answer is whether the enactment of the Splama-
incentivi Decree frustrated Claimants’ legitimate expectation of a “fair remuneration” vis-
a-vis the Fiumicino power plant. In this connection, although the Tribunal has already
rejected Claimants’ claims of legitimate expectations with respect to Claimants’ remaining
eight power plants (see { 839 above), the Tribunal shall nonetheless also answer this
question for these power plants as well, in the interest of completeness. Accordingly,
unless specified otherwise, the Tribunal’s forthcoming findings shall take into account all

nine of Claimants power plants cumulatively.

In order to determine whether the Claimants’ legitimate expectations of a “fair
remuneration” were frustrated by the Spalma-incentivi Decree, it is important to examine,
as a preliminary matter, what constitutes a “fair remuneration”. In this connection, both,
Claimants and Respondent, agree that there was no precise numerical indication of a fair
remuneration provided in the Italian regulatory regime. In Respondent’s view, a fair

remuneration, for the purposes of Article 7(2) of the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003,

288

845.

846.

847.

833,

Final Award

would fall between 5.3-6.6%.**! While Claimants have not countered this with a particular
figure or range, they contend that the range of 5.3-6.6% does not represent an appropriately
fair remuneration for their plants.*°? Further, there is also a discussion between the Parties
about whether the returns Claimants’ plants were earning, prior to the Spalma-incentivi
Decree, were excessive. Respondent calculates Claimants’ plants rates of return at 13-16%
and characterizes the returns as being excessive,**? whereas Claimants’ calculation of the

weighted average rate of return for their plants (pre-tax) is 10.5% and (post-tax) is 7.7%.5*+

The Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to determine the precise
percentage or range that satisfied the “fair remuneration” criteria, especially in the absence
of such a numerical benchmark having been set by Italy while regulating the photovoltaic
energy market. At this juncture, the Tribunal also does not consider it necessary to
determine the propriety of the Parties’ mathematical calculations concerning the returns
being received by Claimants’ plants. For the purposes of determining Italy’s liability under
Article 10(1) ECT, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to understand “fair remuneration”

qualitatively, as opposed to quantitatively.

To this end, the Tribunal recalls certain important tenets of its findings relating to the legal
standard of the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT, namely (i) in order to determine
whether an action is fair or unfair, all relevant circumstances are required to be considered,
including Italy’s right to regulate the photovoltaic energy market as a sovereign State; and
(ii) it must be borne in mind that not every shortcoming in Italy’s action will render the
action unfair, since the overall legal standard for an action to qualify as unfair treatment is
high, in particular because this determination is a balancing exercise between the investors’

expectations and the host State’s regulatory authority (see {{] 685-693 above).

In other words, to determine whether Claimants’ legitimate expectations were frustrated,

the Tribunal shall resort to the overall legal standard for a breach of the FET obligation

(see {| 726-728 above). Moreover, and on a related note, the Tribunal is persuaded by Mr.
Miraglia’s testimony during the Hearing, wherein he stated that the concept of fair
remuneration should be understood keeping in mind the requirement of sustainability of
the entire incentive tariff mechanism:

Q. Where in this law is a reference made to a need to cut the incentive tariffs

in order to ensure a fair return to PV investors?

A. The fair return is a main aspect of the sustainability of a policy, and this is
stated in also the EU guidelines on incentives. So the concept of sustainability
of a mechanism is of course related, the sustainability, to the fair return for an
investment, because a policymaker had to ensure that the investment will be
sustainable, but also to provide a fair remuneration.

So the reference to the sustainability is clearly a large concept, but an aspect --

a priority aspect of sustainability is the economical sustainability, and a fair

return. This is one of the main criteria that is also stated by the EU

guidelines.**
The Tribunal also considers it important to clarify that the understanding of “fair
remuneration” cannot be influenced by the investors’ subjective aspirations while investing
in the Italian market, since as mentioned above Italy had not invited investments based on
any indicative numerical benchmark of a “fair remuneration” in their regulatory documents
(see J 844 above). Thus, what qualifies as “fair remuneration” for Claimants’ power plants
cannot be assessed based on what Claimants targeted while deciding to invest in Italy. The
Tribunal notes that, as per the testimony of Mr. Florian and Mr. Shockley, Claimants had
targeted a (post-levered) rate of return amounting to 14% while investing in Italy.**° The
Tribunal does not consider this aspirational figure to have any impact on its determination

of what qualifies as a “fair remuneration” for Claimants’ plants.

Having delineated the qualitative ingredients of a “fair remuneration”, the Tribunal shall
examine whether the Spalma-incentivi Decree interfered with the obtainment of such
remuneration for Claimants’ plants. In the given facts and circumstances, the Tribunal does
not consider the Spalma-incentivi Decree to interfere with or frustrate Claimants’

expectations for a “fair remuneration”. This is for the following five reasons.

850. First, as mentioned in {{[ 263 and 842 above, all of Claimants’ plants were assigned the

837

third option under the Spalma-incentivi Decree, which was the default option available in
the absence of a choice made by a plant operator. As a result of this third option (see { 261
above), the incentive tariffs would reduce progressively for the remaining incentive period
(out of the total 20 year incentive period, which was retained). This progressive reduction
was (a) 6% for photovoltaic plants having a capacity between 200 and 500 kW; (b) 7% for
photovoltaic plants having a capacity between 500 and 900 kW; and (c) 8% for
photovoltaic plants having a capacity higher than 900 kW.®*” Since all of Claimants’ plants
were beyond 900 kW in capacity, it is not disputed that the incentive tariffs for each of

them was impacted by an 8% progressive reduction.

This reduced incentive tariff for each of Claimants’ photovoltaic plants is appropriately
represented in the following Table 5-1 of FTI’s Mr. Edwards’ first expert report on
quantum related issues:

balanced against other factors to be considered in respect of the sustainability of the overall
incentive mechanism for photovoltaic energy, in particular the exponential rise in the A3
component of the electricity bills being paid by the end consumers (see {| 164-854 above).

Claimants*’* and Respondent*”’ agree that the incentive tariffs being paid by GSE were
being funded, in turn, by the end consumers and were in turn included in the A3
component of their electricity bills. Further, Claimants and Respondent also agree with the
fact that this A3 component had undergone a significant increase since 2005 onwards,

Respondent contends, relying on an Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s report of April
2012, that A3 was the largest component of the consumers’ general charges, constituting
approximately 83% of the share of these charges. The general electricity charges, in turn,
constituted, 23% of the overall cost for electricity borne by consumers.*#! While Claimants
do not deny this increase in charges, they submit that such an increase was foreseeable and
was a direct consequence of the level of support that Italy had chosen to offer to
photovoltaic energy, and Italy’s larger policy decision to socialize these incentive tariffs
passing the burden on to consumers. Further, Claimants submit that the A3 component
ultimately constituted only 10% of the total electricity costs/bills borne by consumers from

2009 up until 2013.5

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ submission that since the rise in the A3
component was a foreseeable consequence of socializing the incentive tariffs, the same
cannot qualify as a justifiable motivation behind Italy’s decision to remodulate the
incentive tariff regime. Regardless of the exact proportion of the total electricity costs/bills
constituted by the A3 component, it is not disputed that this component went through a
significant rise attributable to the incentive tariff regime. Claimants’ regulatory experts
calculate this rise to range from 4.8% in 2008 to 21.4% in 2016. Accordingly, the
Tribunal is convinced by Respondent’s submission that the remodulation of the incentive
tariff regime was motivated in the public interest of easing the burden on the end

consumers (see {| 653 above).

Second, the Tribunal also observes that another agreed aspect regarding the photovoltaic
energy market between the Parties is that the operating costs for photovoltaic plants were
reducing over time. According to Respondent, due to this reduction in the operating costs
for photovoltaic plants, any impact of the reduction in incentive tariffs was appropriately
insulated. The Italian Electrical Energy Authority had commission the Politecnico di
Milano (“Politecnico”), a Milan-based university, to assess the average operating costs of

photovoltaic energy in 2013, which assessed various categories of these operating costs

and calculated an overall reduction in the price. As per Mr. Miraglia from the GSE, this
reduction in the operating costs was attributable primarily to the reduction in the operations
and maintenance costs (“O&M Costs”), which constituted one facet of the overall

operating costs.*#5

Claimants’ witnesses, Mr. Hanna and Mr. Florian, also admit that the O&M Costs for
photovoltaic plants had undergone a reduction over time.**° However, Claimants disagree
that this reduction in the O&M costs could offset the reduction in the incentive tariffs
brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree, since the O&M costs only constituted a part
of the overall operating costs for the photovoltaic plants, and in any event, the categories of

operating costs calculated by Politecnico were not exhaustive and thus not reliable.*#”

In this connection, the Tribunal notes that Claimants had renegotiated their O&M contracts
with respect to all of their plants in 2014, which renegotiation resulted in a reduction in the
O&M Costs.*#8 According to Vector Cuatro’s due diligence report that conducted a full
technical review of Claimants’ solar photovoltaic portfolio and is relied upon by
Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr. Richard Edwards, this reduction in O&M Costs amounted
to “8% on the O&M prices of all PV Plants” in the 1“ quarter 2015, followed by “[a]
reduction of 35% of all Plants from the 2" quarter 2015, with an exception of Campania
with a reduction of 30%”.*? According to both Mr. Edwards and Claimants’ witness, Mr.
Hanna, this reduction of O&M Costs “brought the O&M costs for all of the plants down to

then-current market levels”, and this reduction would anyway have happened “in the

counterfactual scenario”, i.e., if not for the Spalma-incentivi Decree, albeit one year

later.8°°

Accordingly, in light of the above, it becomes evident that a reduction in O&M Costs is an
admitted phenomenon between the Parties. While Respondent calculates such reduction to
amount to 50% by 2014,*°! the due diligence report relied upon by Claimants calculates
such reduction at 35% for all of Claimants’ power plants, except Campagnia where the

reduction was 30% (see {| 858 above).

As mentioned in {845 above, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary, at
this juncture of liability assessment, to comment on the disagreement between the Parties’
mathematical calculations, since it is not yet calculating the quantum of damages, if any. In
any event, the Tribunal does not consider Respondent’s estimate of a 50% reduction to be
too distant from Claimants’ estimated 30-35%. Thus, regardless of the propriety of the
Parties’ respective calculations of the O&M Costs, the Tribunal is convinced that the
reduction in O&M Costs could not only create an appropriate qualitative justification for
the remodulation of the incentive tariffs, but could also quantitatively insulate Claimants
from the impact of such remodulation to some extent. Accordingly, in this connection too,
the Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s submission that the Splama-incentivi Decree

did not cause Claimants’ remunerations to become unfair (see { 653 above).

Third, in their quantum calculations, Claimants have also emphasised the reduction in
Claimants’ investment value, as on the date of assessment (1 January 2015), from EUR
138.3 million in the counter-factual position, to EUR 101 million in the actual position,
thereby amounting to a 27% reduction, of which 19% is attributable to the reduction in
incentive tariffs.*°* This reduction in the value of Claimants’ investments is represented in
the following graphical representation from Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr. Edwards’

of the companies owning Claimants’ photovoltaic plants as of the date of assessment in the
actual and counter-factual position, which evidences a difference of 7% according to him
as a result of the value allegedly dropping from EUR 450.8 million®*? to EUR 419.5

million.54

Assuming Mr. Edwards’ calculations to be accurate, the Tribunal does not consider a
reduction of 7% in the enterprise value of Claimants’ subsidiary companies and a resultant
reduction of 19% in the value of Claimants’ investment to rid Claimants’ photovoltaic
plants of any fair remuneration. Claimants have not demonstrated how the enactment of the
Spalma-incentivi Decree interfered with any legitimate expectations they had towards
obtaining a fair remuneration in respect of their investments. Moreover, in August 2016,
Claimants managed to sell their entire investment portfolio in photovoltaic plants in Italy,
while retaining their ownership over the present ECT claim against Italy (see {| 276-277

above).°55

864. As per Mr. Florian’s testimony, “the sale price reflected substantial lost value from the
changes in the Italian incentives regime” and “[t]he investment returns on this investment,
realized as a result of this sale, we dramatically lower than our expectation”.*°° The

Tribunal is not persuaded by Mr. Florian’s testimony in this connection.

865. The sale price for Claimants’ entire investment portfolio in the 2016 transaction was
approximately EUR 104 million.**7 According to Respondent, this sale price is itself
indicative of the fact that the “the plants were fully profitable and functioning”.*** The
Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to comment on whether the sale
price is reflective of the profitability of Claimants’ photovoltaic power plants. However,
this sale price of approximately EUR 104 million does indicate that the enterprise value of
Claimants’ subsidiary companies, and in turn, the value of Claimants’ investments were
not impacted in such a manner that their photovoltaic plants were rid of any fair
remuneration. If that were the case, the sale price of Claimants’ entire investment portfolio,
which, as per Claimants’ quantum expert was a “strong indicator of market value”,*°?

would have been more severely impacted.

866. Fourth, the Tribunal also considers a comparison with the incentive tariff (or incentive
premium) regimes in other European countries to also be a reflection of what constitutes a
fair remuneration in terms of tariff related benefits. In this regard, the Tribunal reproduces

From a comparison of the above tabulated representation (which reflects the pre-Spalma-
incentivi incentive tariff values) with the table in {| 851 above (which reflects the post-
Spalma-incentivi incentive tariff values), it appears that the incentive tariffs in Italy, even
after remodulation, align with, and are often greater than, the values of such comparable
tariff related benefits in other European countries. This comparison also convinces this
Tribunal to find that the remodulation of the incentive tariff regime by the Spalma-incentivi

Decree did not impede the prospects of fair remuneration for photovoltaic plants.

Fifth, and last, the Tribunal considers it important to specify that the above discussed five
reasons apply with greater effect to Claimants’ Fiumicino power plant, which, to recall,
was the only plant that survived the legitimacy test, insofar as Claimants’ expectations
from the Italian regime were concerned (see {| 840 above). This is because the decrease in
the enterprise value with respect to Claimants’ subsidiary that operated the Fiumicino
plant, SunEdison Apulia 009 S.r.l., and in turn the reduction in the Third Claimant’s
investment value was much less pronounced than for the other Claimants that owned the

other power plants. From Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr. Edwards’ calculation, the fall in

the enterprise value was only EUR 1.1 million as on the assessment date, and the fall in the
investment value was 15%, i.e., much lesser than the average of 27% for the other plants

(see chart in { 861 above).**!

Moreover, the Fiumicino power plant was already earning returns at a much higher internal
rate than Claimants’ other power plants. While the weighted average rate of return for
Claimants’ plants, prior to the Spalma-incentivi Decree, was calculated by them to be
10.5% (pre-tax) and 7.7% (post-tax), the rate of return for the Fiumicino plant was 14.3%
(pre-tax) and 10.8% (post-tax),8* i.e., much higher than the average for Claimants’ other
plants. Furthermore, the original indication of the operating costs for Fiumicino submitted
by Claimants to GSE was higher than the actual operating costs being incurred, which was

also an anomaly compared to Claimants’ other power plants.**

Thus, with the plant already operating at lower costs than the average for Claimants’
plants, and making higher than average returns, the impact of the Spalma-incentivi Decree
was much lower for the Fiumucino power plant than for the others. This is reflective in
Claimants’ quantum expert’s calculation of the impact on the enterprise and investment

value relating to the Fiumicino plant (see {| 868 above).

In light of the above reasons, the Tribunal considers that the remodulation in the incentive
tariff regime brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree to have not frustrated
Claimants’ legitimate expectations of a fair remuneration with respect to the Fiumicino
power plant. Even if Claimants are assumed to have had similar legitimate expectations
vis-a-vis their other power plants, these expectations were similarly not frustrated by the
remodulation of the incentive tariffs. Further, given that the substantive remodulation of
the incentive tariffs itself does not qualify as a frustration of Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, the Tribunal does not consider the alterations in the payment modalities

effected by the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see {| 842 above) to alone have such impact.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects Claimants’ claim that the enactment of the Spalma-

incentivi Decree amounted to a breach of Italy’s FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT.

c. Whether Italy Frustrated any of Claimants’ Legitimate
Expectations by Any Other Measures
In addition to their claims relating to the remodulation of the incentive tariff regime by the
Spalma-incentivi Decree, Claimants have made further claims relating to a breach of their
legitimate expectations that pertain to (i) the imposition of the Administrative Management
Fee and the imbalance costs, on the ground that these costs, in essence, altered the promise
of the fixed incentive tariffs for twenty years; and (ii) the revision of the minimum
guaranteed price effected by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolution 618/2013,
which allegedly impacted Claimants’ smaller plants, i.e., the ones with the capacity under 1

MW. The Tribunal shall deal with these residual claims in turn.

(i) | Administrative Management Fee and Imbalance Costs
Claimants’ contentions are common with respect to the imposition of Administrative
Management Fee and imbalance costs, i.e., that these costs were not imposed at the
commencement of the incentive tariff regime when the investors would decide to invest in
Italy, but were imposed later in the process, thereby interfering with Claimants’ alleged
legitimate expectations of fixed incentive tariffs (see | 618 above). Respondent denies
Claimants’ claims to this end, arguing that the rationale behind the imposed costs was
unrelated to Claimants’ alleged expectations regarding the payment of Conto Energia
tariffs, and in any event their impact was very limited, such that it would not impede the

receipt of a fair remuneration (see {{] 645-650 above).

The Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s arguments. The Tribunal does not consider
Claimants to have any legitimate expectations that such costs should not have been
imposed, nor does the Tribunal consider that the imposition of such costs frustrated

Claimants’ legitimate expectations, if any. This is for the following three reasons.

First, the Tribunal notes that Claimants’ claims with respect to the Administrative
Management Fee and imbalance costs are predicated on the same alleged legitimate

expectations that the claims against the Spalma-incentivi Decree were based on, i.e.,

300

876.

877.

879.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

expectations of a fixed incentive tariff for a period of 20 years since the entry into
operation of the plants. In the previous Sections, the Tribunal has already found that
Claimants did not have, and could not have relied upon, any legitimate expectation that the
incentive tariff rates made available through the Conto Energia Decrees would remain
fixed for a 20 year period. Instead, the only expectation that Claimants could have had
while acquiring the shareholding of the concerned SPVs was that their power plants, once
they were declared to qualify for the incentive scheme within the Second and/or Third
Conto Energia regime, would be ensured a “fair remuneration” for the average
conventional life of photovoltaic plants (20 years), in accordance with the Legislative

Decree No. 387/2003 (see {{[ 819 and 830 above).

Accordingly, the alleged legitimate expectations, upon which Claimants’ claims with
respect to the Administrative Management Fee and imbalance costs are premised, do not
exist. Therefore, Claimants’ claims in this regard cannot succeed for the same reasons that

their claims against the Spalma-incentivi Decree failed.

Second, and in any event, the Tribunal is also persuaded by Respondent’s argument that
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations of a fixed incentive tariff, even if assumed to
exist, cannot be frustrated by the imposition of costs that are totally unrelated to the

incentive tariffs.

In this connection, the Tribunal recalls that the Administrative Management Fee was first
imposed by the Fifth Conto Energia Decree in 2013, requiring photovoltaic energy
producers to pay an annual fee of EUR 0.0005/kWh of incentivized energy. As per Article
10.4 of the Fifth Conto Energia Decree, the intention behind the imposition of the
Administrative Management Fee was “[t]o cover GSE management costs, and the cost of

checks and controls by GSE” (see ff 214-217 above).8™

Similarly, the imbalance costs were first imposed in 2012 by Resolutions 281 and 493 of
the Italian Electrical Energy Authority. However, after the Consiglio di Stato, Italy’s

highest administrative court, found Resolution 281 to be unlawful for being

the Energy Authority passed another Resolution 522 in 2014, which also
pertained to regulating imbalance costs in respect of non-programmable renewable energy
producers, albeit by creating distinct bands for different sources of renewable energy with
the option of commercial aggregation (see {| 229-238 above). The intention behind the
imposition of the imbalance costs, as per Resolution 281, was “to promote greater
accountability of dispatching users of plants fuelled by non-programmable renewable
sources so that to guarantee an efficient forecast of electricity fed into the grid, and, in
particular, an equitable sharing of costs generated by the electrical system that can no
longer fall solely on electricity consumers.”*® Along the same lines, Resolution 522
provided that “the burdens deriving from the imbalances imputable to nonprogrammable
renewable sources must not be socialized in order to avoid unjustifiable discrimination, and
in order not to continue to allocate burdens on the community . . . it is appropriate to

review the guidelines on imbalances for non-programmable renewable sources”.°°”

From the above, it is apparent to the Tribunal that the motivations behind the imposition of
the Administrative Management Fee and the imbalance costs were unrelated to the
incentive tariffs offered by the Conto Energia Decrees. While the Administrative
Management Fee was intended to cover the GSE’s costs, the imbalance costs were
intended to cover the imbalances in the grid created as a result of non-programmable
sources of energy, i.e., those sources of energy for which it “is not objectively impossible
to predict the [amount of] energy produced and fed into the grid”.*°* Even if one were to
assume that Italy was under an obligation to maintain the incentive tariffs for a period of
20 years since the entry into operation of plants (which it was not), this obligation cannot
translate to a prohibition against imposition of any reasonable additional costs on the

beneficiaries of the incentive tariffs.

As Claimants themselves admit with respect to the imbalance costs, such costs are known

in any electricity system and “[pJolicymakers have the choice either of charging imbalance

costs to renewable producers or passing them on to consumers”.*® In other words, Italian
authorities have the discretion to either socialize such costs or impose them on the
producers. This discretion exists regardless of the incentive tariffs that are being offered
separately by Italy to the producers. This discretion also exists after such tariffs have been
offered by Italy, i.e., Italy has the regulatory power to subsequently impose certain costs on

producers that were earlier being socially borne by the people.

In this connection, the Tribunal also notes that the Consiglio di Stato, while invalidating
the Resolution 281, had recognized the Italian authorities’ discretion to allocate imbalance
costs between consumers and/or producers. In this regard, it had clarified that its findings
on discrimination between different sources of energies should not be construed to “mean
that the imbalance costs caused by these production units should, as it was the case in the
previous regime, be socialized. This mechanism would lend itself to . . . criticisms.”°”°
Although the question of whether Resolution 522 is in violation of the Consiglio di Stato’s
ruling is disputed between the Parties,*’! the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or
necessary to resolve this disputed matter in the present proceedings. For the purposes of
Italy’s FET obligations under Article 10(1) ECT, it suffices for the Tribunal to find that the
imposition of imbalance costs, as well as the Administrative Management Fee, were
unrelated to the incentive tariff regime and were a reasonable exercise of the State’s

regulatory powers.

Along the same lines, the Tribunal also endorses the following findings of the Greentech v.

Italy tribunal:

Further, as to the impact of these measures, Claimants asserted that the
administrative fee and imbalance costs did not directly change the incentive
tariff rates granted to PV facilities but instead altered the “general economic
framework”.

The foreseeability of the administrative fees and imbalance costs raises the
question not only whether Respondent undertook the measures in a transparent,
good faith manner, but also whether Claimants’ assertions of legitimate
expectations are justified. Upon consideration of the Parties’ arguments, the

SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Tribunal finds that the foreseeability of the costs, the silence regarding those

costs in the Conto Energia decrees and GSE Agreements, and absence of a

direct effect of those costs on the Conto tariffs collectively weigh against the

conclusion that Claimants had a legitimate expectation that such costs would

not be imposed on PV producers.*””
Third, with respect to the reasonableness of these measures, the Tribunal is also persuaded
by Respondent’s submission that these measures did not have a significant impact on
Claimants’ plants, and did not frustrate their legitimate entitlement to a fair remuneration.
As per a GSE report to the Ministry for Economic Development, relied upon by
Respondent and not disputed by Claimants, the Administrative Management Fee imposed
at EUR 0.0005/kWh of incentivized energy, constituted 0.17% of the incentives received
by the beneficiaries under the Fifth Conto Energia.’” Even as per Claimants’ quantum
expert Mr. Edwards’ calculation of the operating costs of photovoltaic plants (for the year
2015), both the Administrative Management Fee and the imbalance costs constituted only

2% each of the entire costs.°”4

The Tribunal does not consider such a minimal impact on operating costs to constitute a
frustration of Claimants’ legitimate expectations of obtaining a fair remuneration under
Legislative Decree 387/2003. In this connection, the Tribunal refers to its previous findings
with respect to what constitutes a “fair remuneration” (see in general Section VIII.B(3)
b(iii) above). These findings are equally relevant for the present Section and should be

considered incorporated by reference herein.

In light of the above, the Tribunal rejects Claimants’ claim that the imposition of the
Administrative Management Fee or the imbalance costs amounted to a breach of Italy’s
FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT, for frustrating Claimants’ legitimate

expectations.

(ii) Minimum Guaranteed Price
With respect to the off-take regime, created through the Legislative Decree No.
387/2003,°> Claimants claim that the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolution 618,
which decreased the minimum guaranteed price for 2014 to EUR 38.9/MWh, frustrated
Claimants’ legitimate expectations of the availability of minimum guaranteed prices that
were above a certain competitive threshold. Claimants have also challenged the limitation
of the off-take regime to photovoltaic plants with capacity under 100 kW, as opposed to
the original limiting capacity denominator of 1 MW. Claimants base their legitimate
expectations in this connection, inter alia, on Resolution 280/2007 of the Italian Electrical
Energy Authority, and the trend of the minimum guaranteed price set by the Italian
Electrical Energy Authority since 2008 until 2013. The minimum guaranteed prices
affected four of Claimants’ smallest plants, i.e., Santoro, San Marco, Lenare and Monaci

(see items 1, 2, 3 and 5 of | 768 above).°”°

Respondent disputes the existence of Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations for a level
of minimum guaranteed price, since the provision of minimum guaranteed prices by the
Italian Electrical Energy Authority was only a regulatory implementation of the off-take
regime prescribed under the primary legislations, i.e., Article 13 of Legislative Decree No.
387/03 and Article 1(41) of Law No. 39/2004. Further, Respondent has contested the scope
of any legitimate expectations relating to minimum guaranteed prices based on the
motivations behind such a regime, i.e., to ensure economic survival of smaller plants, but
not to ensure profitability. Moreover, Respondent argues that the rise in operating costs, in
particular vis-a-vis the smaller photovoltaic plants, reported in Politecnico’s 2013 report
(see {| 856 above), justified the alterations in the minimum guaranteed prices, both with
respect to the reduction in amount and the limitations in the eligibility criteria (see {| 656-

661 above).

The Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s arguments. The Tribunal does not consider that

Claimants could have had any legitimate expectations of the minimum guaranteed prices

remaining consistent in terms of range or eligibility criteria, and in any event, the reduction
in the minimum guaranteed price and the alterations to the eligibility criteria are justified.

This is for the following four reasons.

First, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that neither the Italian Electrical Energy
Authority’s Resolution 280/2007 nor the apparent trend of the minimum guaranteed price
set by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority since 2008 until 2013 could source any
legitimate expectations for Claimants. The minimum guaranteed price regime was
established only to implement the off-take regime, which was created by the Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003. This off-take regime, pursuant to Article 13(3) of the Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003, required the grid operator to purchase all electricity injected into the
grid by renewable energy producers, if the producers so requested.*”” Under this provision
of the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Italian Electrical Energy Authority was tasked

8 and it was further to this

with establishing the modalities of this off-take regime,*”
delegation that it laid down these modalities primarily in Resolutions No. 34/2005 and

280/2007 (see | 167-173 above).°””

Both these Resolutions No. 34/2005 and 280/2007 also clearly mention that they were
issued pursuant to the underlying primary legislative instruments, i.e., Articles 13(3) and
13(4) of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and paragraph 41 of Law No. 239/2004. For
instance, Article 2 of Resolution No. 280/2007 provided:
This document set forth the terms and conditions for the purchase of the
electricity generated by plants pursuant to article 13, para 3 and 4 of legislative
decree 29 December 2003, no. 387, and para 41 of law 23 august 2004, no.
239,880
In light of the above factors, the Tribunal considers Resolution 280/2007, from which
Claimants source their legitimate expectations, to be hierarchically subordinate to the

Legislative Decree No. 387/2003. In this connection, the Tribunal considers that its

previous findings relating to the hierarchical subordination of the Conto Energia Decrees
also apply with equal effect to the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolutions (see §]]
793-800 above). Given that due to, inter alia, their hierarchical subordination, the Tribunal
did not source any legitimate expectations from the (ministerial) Conto Energia Decrees,
the Tribunal similarly considers that the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolution

280/2007 cannot source any legitimate expectations of minimum guaranteed prices.

893. Instead, the Tribunal recognizes that Resolution 280/2007 operated within the broader
regulatory framework of Article 13(3) of the Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, which only
stated that “[t]he [Italian Electrical Energy Authority] provides for the modalities of the
off-take regime of the electricity hereunder by referring to economic market conditions.”
This Legislative Decree did not prescribe the grant or consistent availability of minimum

guaranteed prices.

894. Further, the Tribunal notes that the text of Resolution 280/2007 did not contain any
provision that guaranteed the maintenance of minimum guaranteed prices at a particular
level or range. To the contrary, both Parties agree that Resolution 280/2007 authorized the
Italian Electrical Energy Authority to revise the minimum guaranteed price each year from
2008 onwards.**! Moreover, the agreements entered into between Claimants’ SPVs and the
GSE, pursuant to this Resolution 280/2007 (see {175 above) with respect to this minimum
guaranteed prices, also did not contain a provision guaranteeing a consistent range for
these prices.*** In fact, these off-take agreements authorized the GSE to unilaterally

883

terminate or modify the agreements “consistently with any modifications and

integrations made to . . . [R]esolution 280/07”.8*

895. In addition, the Tribunal finds that the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s practice

between EUR 72.2/MWh to EUR 105.8 EUR/MWh,°*> could also not be relied upon as a
source of legitimate expectations. As mentioned already, Resolution 280/2007 itself
authorized the Italian Electrical Energy Authority to annually modify the minimum
guaranteed prices. It was further to this authorization that the Energy Authority revised
these minimum guaranteed prices on a yearly basis by way of further Resolutions and/or
press-releases (see [| 176-177 above).**° If Resolution 280/2007 could not source any
legitimate expectations for a constant minimum guaranteed price, a trend established by the
Italian Electrical Energy Authority pursuant to this Resolution also could not create such

legitimate expectations.

Second, the Tribunal also agrees with Respondent that Claimants could not have
legitimately expected that their smaller power plants would consistently remain profitable
pursuant to the off-take regime. As mentioned in Resolution 280/2007 itself, the
motivation behind the minimum guaranteed price regime was “to ensure the economic
survival of the smaller plants . . . even if market prices were to fall significantly”, and to
“provide dedicated simplifications” of the market by virtue of the minimum guaranteed

1,889

prices (emphasis added).**’ Both, Claimants*** and Respondent agree that the

motivation behind the minimum guaranteed prices was to ensure “economic survival” of

the smaller plants. In this regard, Claimants argued the following during the Hearing:

There_was not a specific expectation that the minimum guaranteed_prices
would be an absolutely specific euro cents per kilowatt hour, like the incentive
tariffs, because the minimum guaranteed prices could change a bit from year to
year. But our clients’ expectation regarding minimum guaranteed prices was
that minimum guaranteed prices would be paid in a meaningful amount in
order to safeguard those four smaller plants.**’ (emphasis added)

SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

In the above quoted passage, Claimants admit that the objective of safeguarding the
economic survival of smaller plants does not imply that the minimum guaranteed prices
would always be fixed at a particular amount or in a particular range. In other words,
ensuring economic survival does not guarantee that the minimum prices would always be
equal to or greater than the market prices of electricity. The only requirement under Article
13(3) of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 was that the modalities of the off-take regime
had to be laid down by “referring to economic market conditions” (see { 893 above). This
requirement does not serve to equate the minimum guaranteed prices to the market prices,

nor does it elevate them above the market prices.

Third, the Tribunal considers that this requirement of “referring to economic market
conditions” was satisfied by Politecnico’s 2013 report, which was prepared upon the Italian
Electrical Energy Authority’s invitation. This report, inter alia, contained an analysis of
average electricity production costs from different sources of renewable energy, depending
on data from power plants with a capacity up to 1 MW. It concluded that operating costs
were generally reducing over time in comparison to the market electricity prices, except in

the case of very small scale power plants under 3 kW (see {| 220-220 above).

As discussed in {J 856-860 above, Claimants have contested the authenticity of the data
considered by Politecnico, and have also contested the accuracy and completeness of their
findings. However, the Tribunal has already found that the phenomenon of reduction of
operating costs, and in particular O&M Costs, was not contested by Claimants. In fact, to
recall, Vector Cuatro’s due diligence report, which conducted a review of Claimants’
photovoltaic portfolio and is extensively relied upon by Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr.
Edwards, specifically stated that the reduction in O&M Costs amounted to “8% on the
O&M prices of all PV Plants” in the 1“ quarter 2015, followed by “[a] reduction of 35% of
all Plants from the 2™ quarter 2015”.**! This reduction in the O&M costs being discussed
in this due diligence report, pertains to both the big and small power plants operated by
Claimants’ SPVs, including four of the smallest plants relevant for this Section, i.e.,

Santoro, San Marco, Lenare and Monaci.

Thus, notwithstanding the mathematical divergences in the Parties’ calculations and the
propriety of the Politecnico report, the Tribunal considers Claimants’ admission regarding
reduction of the O&M Costs to apply equally to its smaller plants. This suffices for the
Tribunal to endorse Respondent’s justification behind reducing the minimum guaranteed
prices as a result of the corresponding reduction in operating costs. As mentioned in { 860
above, the exact amount of reduction is not necessary to determine at this stage, while

assessing Italy’s liability under Article 10(1) ECT.

Fourth, and lastly, the Tribunal notes that the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s
Resolution 618, which decreased the minimum guaranteed price for 2014 to EUR
38.9/MWh, was followed by the Destinazione Italia, i.e., Legislative Decree No. 145/2013.
This Legislative Decree, inter alia, provided that the minimum guaranteed price for all
photovoltaic plants benefiting from the Conto Energia Decrees would be equal to the
hourly zonal price, with the exception for photovoltaic plants with a capacity below 100

kW (see JJ 225-228 above).°

In effect, as mentioned in the speech by the President of the Italian Electrical Energy
Authority, Mr. Guido Bortoni, the Destinazione Italia Decree ended up equating the
minimum guaranteed process with the market prices for electricity for all photovoltaic
plants with a capacity above 100 kW.*® The specific minimum guaranteed prices, distinct

from the market prices, were limited to plants with a capacity under 100 kW.

With respect to this limitation in the eligibility criteria, the Tribunal is persuaded by
Respondent’s contention that there was never any rule, either in the Legislative Decree No.
387/2003 or in Resolution 280/2007, that minimum guaranteed prices would always be
available for photovoltaic plants with a capacity under 1 MW. Indeed, if the values of the
minimum guaranteed prices could fluctuate as a consequence of the Italian Electrical
Energy Authority’s power to regulate these prices based on market conditions, the same
oscillations in the market conditions could also trigger changes in the eligibility criteria for

minimum guaranteed prices.

904. In this connection, the Tribunal agrees with the following findings of the majority of the
tribunal in Greentech v. Italy, with respect to the changes in the minimum guaranteed price

regime:

Regarding the claim based on legitimate expectations, a majority of the
Tribunal has not been persuaded that Claimants formed such expectations that,
after 2013, they would continue to receive minimum prices at levels similar to
those which they received from 2008 to 2013. In the view of a majority of the
Tribunal, it was not demonstrated that Italy made any explicit or implicit
assurance that would warrant such expectations. Nor, in the majority’s view,
could the Preamble to Resolution no. 280 of 2007, mentioning prices “to
ensure the economic survival of smaller plants, even in case the market prices
were to fall significantly”, without more, suffice to engender legitimate
expectations, given that the power to set prices annually remained with the
{Italian Electrical Energy Authority].

As for the second aspect of Claimants’ legitimate expectations argument,
concerning the limitation on PV plants eligible to receive minimum guaranteed
prices and the decision to restrict most plants from obtaining both the Conto
Energia tariffs and the minimum prices, a majority of the Tribunal also finds
that legitimate expectations were not formed. In the view of a majority of the
Tribunal, a position need not be taken on whether the stated purpose of the
[minimum guaranteed price] Scheme was undermined by the restrictions Italy
put into effect in 2014, since the Tribunal majority is not persuaded that
limiting the number of plants eligible for the MGP Scheme, in the absence of
assurances that a wider applicability would be maintained, contravenes any
legitimate expectations of Claimants. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds, by a
majority, that Italy’s modifications of the [minimum guaranteed price] Scheme,
under [Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s] Resolution 618 of 19 December
2013 and the Destinazione Italia law decree issued on 23 December 2013, did
not constitute breaches of legitimate expectations.***

905. In light of the above discussed reasons, the Tribunal rejects Claimants’ claim that the
changes to the minimum guaranteed price regime amounted to a breach of Italy’s FET

obligation under Article 10(1) ECT, for frustrating Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

d. Whether Italy Breached its Obligation of Transparency and
Consistency
Claimants have invoked Respondent’s obligation to act in a transparent and consistent
manner as an independent tenet of the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT. To this
end, Claimants contend that Italy’s conduct of (i) retroactively imposing an Administrative
Management Fee to all photovoltaic plants; (ii) imposing imbalance costs; (iii)
remodulating the Conto Energia framework with the Spalma-incentivi Decree; (iv)
reducing the minimum guaranteed prices to EUR 38.9 EUR/MWh, (v) failing to reimburse
sums paid under the unconstitutional Robin Hood Tax; and (vi) classifying photovoltaic
facilities as immovable property, amounted to a breach of the obligation of transparent and

consistent conduct (see [| 620-622 above).

Respondent contests the existence of an independent obligation to act in a transparent and
consistent manner under Article 10(1) ECT. Given the overlap between the arguments
relating to legitimate expectations as well as the alleged obligation relating to transparent
and consistent conduct, Respondent merely refers back to all its submissions on the
legitimate expectations issue in order to refute Claimants’ allegations of non-transparency

and inconsistency (see {{[ 662-663 above).

The Tribunal makes the following observations with respect to Claimants’ invocation of
Respondent’s alleged breach of the obligation to conduct itself in a transparent and

consistent manner under Article 10(1) ECT.

At the outset, the Tribunal recalls that the issues relating to the Robin Hood Tax and the
classification of photovoltaic plants as immovable property have been found to fall outside
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction for being “taxation measures” under Article 21 ECT (see { 584
above). Accordingly, Claimants’ claims with respect to these issues shall not be

determined by the Tribunal in this Section.

With respect to the other allegations made by Claimants, the Tribunal recalls its findings
relating to the legal standard of the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT. Therein, the
Tribunal has determined, based on the Parties’ positions and a review of investment

arbitration case law, that claims relating to non-transparent and inconsistent conduct, while

312

911.

913.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

theoretically distinct, often overlap with claims relating to legitimate expectations. This is
on the ground that the notions of transparency and consistency are a subliminal part of the
investor’s legitimate expectations on most occasions. It is only in exceptional situations,
depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, that a host State can be found guilty of
having conducted itself in a non-transparent or inconsistent manner, without also having

frustrated an investor’s legitimate expectations, or vice versa (see J 731-733 above).

The Tribunal does not consider the current case to present any exceptional situation due to
which the claims, and in turn the Tribunal’s findings, with respect to legitimate
expectations should be dissociated from the claims and findings relating to non-transparent
and/or inconsistent conduct. Accordingly, the Tribunal recalls its findings whereby it
rejected Claimants’ claims relating to frustration of legitimate expectations on all counts,
i.e., (i) enactment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see J 841-871 above); (ii) imposition of
the Administrative Management Fee and imbalance costs (see [| 873-886 above); and (iii)
changes to the minimum guaranteed prices regime (see {| 887-905 above). For all the
reasons that the Tribunal rejected Claimants’ claims relating to legitimate expectations on
the above counts, the Tribunal also rejects Claimants’ claims relating to the alleged lack of

transparency and consistency in Respondent’s conduct.

In addition, and in any event, the Tribunal notes that Claimants have not demonstrated any
additional elements in Italy’s conduct with respect to the implicated measures that shows a

lack of transparency or consistency.

For instance, the Spalma-incentivi Decree was not a solitary or unexpected instance of
remodulation of the incentive tariff regime. It was preceded by numerous versions of the
incentive schemes that Italy had offered to photovoltaic producers starting from the early
1990s (see {| 95-96 above). More recently, it was preceded by (i) the Fourth Conto
Energia Decree (see Section IV.B(5) above), which already contained elements of some
remodulation, since it indicated an upper limit or a “national indicative installed capacity
target” (of 23 GW or a yearly indicative cumulative cost of incentives between EUR 6 to 7

billion), beyond which incentive tariffs shall not be freshly issued;*?> (ii) the Fifth Conto

CEX-161, Fourth Conto Energia Decree, articles 1.2, 12.1 and 12.2.

Energia Decree (see Section IV.B(6) above), which set the national indicative cumulative
cost of incentives at EUR 6.7 million;® and (iii) the Destinazione Italia Decree (see [J
225-227 and {{[ 255-257 above), which had already given photovoltaic producers the
option between (a) continuing the existing incentive scheme for the 20 year period without
any additional benefits after the expiration of this period; or (b) accepting a reduced
percentage of tariff incentives under the Conto Energia Decrees, in exchange for an

extension in the duration of the incentive period by seven years.*””

Accordingly, the Spalma-incentivi Decree was not inconsistent with Italy’s prior conduct,
nor is there any indication of it having been issued in a non-transparent manner. Indeed, the
Decree granted photovoltaic plant operators approximately five months to chose between
the three options of remodulation presented by the Decree, as opposed to directly imposing

any remodulation scheme that the host State considered fit without consulting producers.

Similarly, the imposition of the Administrative Management Fee cannot be characterized
as retroactive or inconsistent with Italy’s prior conduct. The fact that the Administrative
Management Fee, after being imposed, was applicable to all plants that were covered under
any of the Conto Energia Decrees does not render such imposition retroactive. The
Administrative Management Fee was only payable 1 January 2013 onwards, i.e., with
prospective application (see { 214 above). Further, Claimants have admitted that costs such
as the Administrative Management Fee and imbalance costs are “completely foreseeable
costs of a renewable energy support system”.*°® However, Claimants’ argue that such costs
should always have been imposed on the producers, instead of the consumers, in order to
ensure consistency in the system. This argument is unconvincing. As has already been

899 it falls within a host

determined above and as confirmed by the Consiglio di Stato,
State’s regulatory power to balance the burdens between the producers and the consumers
in the interest of a sustainable incentive system. The allocation of the Administrative

Management Fee and the imbalance costs onto the producers, thus, was a foreseeable

exercise of the Italy’s regulatory powers, and cannot be characterized as inconsistent

conduct (see {| 881-883 above).

Along the same lines, the Tribunal finds that the changes to the minimum guaranteed price
regime by Resolution 618 of 2013 were neither non-transparent nor inconsistent with
Italy’s prior conduct. Not only were the minimum guaranteed prices subject to annual
modifications, Resolution 618, which reduced the minimum guaranteed prices to 38.9
EUR/MWAh, was preceded by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s document for public
consultation that invited the stakeholders’ comments on the reduction of these prices with

effect from 2014 (see {| 221-222 above).°

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds Italy’s conduct to be transparent and consistent

with its prior conduct, and therefore not in breach of Article 10(1) ECT.

e. Whether Italy Breached its Obligation of Good Faith Conduct

Another additional argument raised by Claimants is that Respondent’s conduct, in
particular relating to the Splama-incentivi Decree and the imposition of the Administrative
Management Fee and imbalance costs, was violative of good faith, and thus, in breach of
the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT (see {| 623-624 above). Respondent disputes
the existence of good faith as an independent tenet of the FET obligation under Article
10(1) ECT, but in any event, argues that Claimants have not met the burden of proving that
any of Italy’s conduct was directed specifically towards Claimants in a mala fide manner.
According to Respondent, each of the measures Claimants complain against were aimed at
maintaining the sustainability of the electricity sector and drawing a balance between the

interests of the end-consumers and the producers (see {{] 664-665 above).

In its findings relating to the legal standard of the FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT,
the Tribunal has already found that the requirement of good faith or bona fide conduct does
not constitute a separate tenet of the FET obligation. This is on the ground that good faith
permeates across all other independent tenets of the FET obligation, including the tenets of

legitimate expectations as well as transparent and consistent conduct (see {J 737-739

CEX-413/REX-042, AEEG Document for public consultation no. 486, Oct. 31, 2013; see SoC, {| 186, fn

above). Accordingly, it is not appropriate or necessary for the Tribunal to independently
examine Claimants’ distinct claims relating to an alleged breach of good faith conduct. The
Tribunal’s findings relating to the claims of legitimate expectations as well as transparent

and consistent conduct are dispositive of Claimants’ claims relating to good faith conduct.

In any event, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have not satisfied the high threshold of
establishing a lack of good faith on part of Italy (see {| 740 above). There is no evidence
that any of the Italian authorities wilfully or intentionally committed an unfair or
inequitable action vis-a-vis photovoltaic investors such as Claimants. Further, there is no
evidence to refute Respondent’s argument that its conduct was motivated towards
achieving sustainability in the electricity sector by distributing the burdens between

consumers and producers.

f. Conclusion

In light of the above reasons, the Tribunal rejects Claimants’ claims that Italy breached its
FET obligation under Article 10(1) ECT. In particular, the Tribunal concludes that Italy did
not frustrate any of Claimants’ legitimate expectations (see JJ 871, 886 and 905 above),
nor does its conduct reflect a lack of transparency, consistency or good faith that would

render it in breach of the FET obligation (see {J 917 and 920 above).

ARTICLE 10(1) ECT: UNREASONABLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT (IMPAIRMENT
CLAUSE)

(1) Claimants’ Position
a. The Legal Standard

According to Claimants, the “impairment” clause under Article 10(1) of the ECT
prescribes a low threshold for the requisite impact on an investment. Relying on

investment arbitration case law, Claimants submit that the term “impairment” means “any

316

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

negative impact or effect”, and includes, both, acts and omissions by the State. As per

Claimants, the impairment need not be significant.?”

923. As per Claimants, a measure is unreasonable if it is taken without due consideration of the
potential negative effects it will have on foreign investors. For Claimants, the test for
reasonableness of a measure is the parties’ expectations at the time of the decision to invest
as opposed to what the State might view as reasonable from a policy perspective. In this
connection, Claimants rely on the articulation of the unreasonable and discriminatory
treatment standard by the tribunals in BG Group v. Argentina and Toto Construzioni v.

Lebanon.?

924. Claimants reject Respondent’s assertion that Claimants’ allegations regarding
Respondent’s breaches of the impairment clause under Article 10(1) of the ECT overlap

with Claimants’ FET claim, and in this connection rely on investment arbitration case law

and scholarly authority.°%

b. _ Italy’s Alleged Breach of the Impairment Clause

925. Claimants contend that Respondent’s retroactive modifications to the Conto Energia
Decrees and its support framework were contrary to a host of long-term guarantees and
assurances made by Respondent and were, therefore, unreasonable and impaired
Claimants’ investments in Italy. Claimants argue that Respondent disproportionately

saddled photovoltaic investors, and no other renewable energy or traditional energy

producers, with the burden of its political decision to decrease the overall costs of
electricity bills for end consumers, without having any regard of the financial impact on
photovoltaic investors such as Claimants. Further, Claimants highlight the lack of a proper
procedure to modify contracts, which was done by Italy unilaterally. Claimants rely on the
opinion of their regulatory expert, FTI Consulting, to contend that the retroactive measures

implemented by Respondent were arbitrary, discriminatory and inefficient.°*

Claimants further argue that the retroactive measures undertaken by Respondent were
bereft of any reasons or justification. In this connection, in addition to the Spalma-incentivi
Decree’s unilateral and discriminatory enactment without regard to the investors’
contractual rights, Claimants contend that the breach of the impairment clause is
“particularly important” for the other measures enacted by Italy, which include (i)
imposition of the Administrative Management Fee; (ii) reduction of the minimum
guaranteed price; (iii) failure to reimburse sums paid under the unconstitutional Robin
Hood Tax; and (iv) the arbitrary classification of photovoltaic facilities as immovable

property were unreasonable.””>

(2) Respondent’s Position

a. The Legal Standard

Respondent contends that there is a substantial overlap between the FET standard and the
“unreasonable or discriminatory measures” provision under Article 10(1) ECT, particularly
when the State’s measures under challenge are alleged to be unreasonable. Respondent
submits that the Tribunal must, therefore, assess each situation individually to examine
whether there is an overlap between the unreasonable or discriminatory measures claim

and the FET claim.°°°

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Respondent disputes the meaning of “impairment” as proposed by Claimants. According to
Respondent, the term “impairment” should be determined by making reference to the legal
context of the clause. Respondent contends that claims for marginal negative effects
suffered by foreign investors is not covered by Article 10(1) ECT. Respondent relies on the
interpretation of the term “impairment” proposed by the Electrabel v. Hungary tribunal,
which in reference to Article 10(1) ECT, stated that “a breach of this standard requires the

impairment caused by the discriminatory or unreasonable measure to be significant”.°°”

Respondent also disputes Claimants’ interpretation of the term “unreasonable measure”
under Article 10(1) ECT.*°* According to Respondent, the correct interpretation of the term
“unreasonable measure” under Article 10(1) ECT was put forth by the AES v. Hungary
tribunal, which held that “two elements that require to be analysed to determine whether a
state’s act was unreasonable: the existence of a rational policy; and the reasonableness of
the act of the state in relation to the policy”. Accordingly, as per Respondent, the
reasonableness of the policy is to be adjudged in terms of the correlation between the

measure and the policy.°”

b. _ Italy’s Alleged Breach of the Impairment Clause

Respondent challenges the invocation by Claimants of a separate treaty breach under the
impairment clause of Article 10(1) ECT on the grounds that there is substantial overlap
between Claimants’ allegations of breach of the impairment clause and of the FET standard
under Article 10(1) ECT by Respondent. Thus, Respondent, for the most part, recalls its
arguments made in respect of the FET standard, especially to justify the reasonableness

and non-discriminatory nature of the Spalma-incentivi Decree.?'”

For the legitimacy of the purpose behind the enactment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree,
Respondent highlights the technological progress in the photovoltaic energy market, the

reduced costs for producing electricity and the detrimental impact on consumers who

treated in absolute parity with other renewable energy sectors.?!!

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

At the outset, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to reproduce Article 10(1) ECT (quoted

in its entirety in { 587 above), in its relevant part:

Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to
Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and
security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures their maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal. (emphasis added)

 

The emphasised part in the above quotation from Article 10(1) ECT has been referred to by
the Parties as the “Impairment Clause” in their submissions, and shall accordingly be

referred to by the Tribunal similarly in its forthcoming analysis.

To determine whether Respondent is in breach of the Impairment Clause, the Tribunal
shall first examine the legal standard for a host State’s conduct to amount to a breach of the
said Impairment Clause, and, based on its findings regarding this legal standard,
subsequently determine whether Respondent’s conduct, in the present case, qualifies as a

breach of the Impairment Clause in Article 10(1) ECT.

a. The Legal Standard

The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ disagreement with respect to the legal standard
concerning the Impairment Clause relates to two related aspects: (i) the meaning of
“impairment”, i.e., the standard that is required to be satisfied in order to declare that a
measure “impairs” the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of an

investment; and (ii) the meaning of “unreasonable”, i.e., the standard that is required to be

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

satisfied in order for a measure to be declared unreasonable. The Tribunal shall examine

each of these aspects in turn.

With respect to the first disputed matter, i.e., concerning the meaning of “impairment”, the
Tribunal considers it important to clarify, as a preliminary matter, that a determination of
impairment of the investment precedes an examination of whether the measure resulting in
such impairment was unreasonable or discriminatory. This is apparent from the text of the
Impairment Clause in Article 10(1) ECT, which does not implicate every measure that is
alleged to be unreasonable or discriminatory, but only such unreasonable or discriminatory
measures that “in any way impair . . . [the] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal” of the investment. In other words, as stated by the tribunal in AES v. Hungary,
“[aJn analysis of the nature of a state’s measures, in order to determine if they are
unreasonable or discriminatory, is only necessary when an impairment of the investment

took place.”?!?

Further, concerning the legal standard that the “impairment” is required to satisfy, the
Tribunal considers it important understand the Impairment Clause, as per Article 31
VCLT, i.e., within the context offered by Article 10(1) ECT and the overall object and
purpose of the ECT. In respect of the context, the Tribunal considers that the Impairment
Clause should be understood in the same light as the FET obligation, which precedes the
Impairment Clause in Article 10(1) ECT. Similarly, the Tribunal considers that its findings
relating to the overall object and purpose of the ECT laid down in the context of the FET

obligation are equally applicable to the Impairment Clause (see {{ 678 se seq.).

To this end, the Tribunal considers it important emphasize two aspects that informed the
Tribunal’s understanding of the FET obligation, which are also relevant here, i.e., (i) the
importance of taking together and balancing all circumstances of a case, and in this
connection, the importance of understanding the investor’s expectations in light of the host
State’s sovereignty and its right to regulate, which is recognized in the International

Energy Charter (see { 685 above); and (ii) the recognition that that the overall standard to

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

establish a breach of the FET obligation is high, which also holds true for the Impairment
Clause (see J 688 above).

Keeping the above factors in mind, the Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s submission
that not every marginal negative effect suffered by investors will be covered under the
Impairment Clause in Article 10(1) ECT (see { 928 above). Setting the standard for
“impairment” so low shall not afford the due deference to a host State’s regulatory
authority and shall run counter to the overall high standard for the FET obligation, which

forms part of the same legal provision in the ECT, i.e., Article 10(1) ECT.

In this connection, the Tribunal is in agreement with the findings of the tribunal in
Electrabel v. Hungary that a breach of the Impairment Clause in Article 10(1) ECT
“requires the impairment caused by the discriminatory or unreasonable measure to be
significant”.°'? (emphasis added) Thus, contrary to Claimants’ arguments, the threshold of
“impairment” under Article 10(1) ECT is not low, and does not cover every negative
impact on the investment or every case where “money was withheld”.?'* In order for an
impact on the investment to qualify as an impairment for the purposes of a breach of the
Impairment Clause, the impact needs to be significant in the facts and circumstances of the

case.

With respect to the second disputed matter, ie., concerning the standard for
unreasonableness, the text of Article 10(1) ECT does not offer any specific guidance as to
the meaning of the term “unreasonable”. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 31 VCLT, the
Tribunal interprets the term “unreasonable” according to its ordinary meaning taking into
account the context and the object and purpose of the ECT. Again, the Tribunal shall keep
in mind the contextual factors emphasised in {{[ 937-938 above for this interpretative

exercise.

In this connection, the Tribunal considers that the case law relied upon by Claimants and
Respondent to derive the ordinary meaning of “unreasonableness” are not at variance from

each other.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Claimants rely on the following finding of BG Group v. Argentina to derive the standard
for unreasonableness:

Like the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard, ‘reasonableness’ should be

measured against the expectations of the parties to the bilateral investment

treaty, rather than as a function of the means chosen by the State to achieve its

915

goals.
In reliance of the above passage, Claimants argue that “the ‘reasonableness’ of a measure
must be judged from the standpoint of the parties’ expectations at the time of the decision
to invest”.°!° The Tribunal considers Claimants’ understanding of the finding of the BG
Group v. Argentina tribunal to be misplaced. The above quoted finding of the tribunal in
BG Group v. Argentina underscores the expectations of the States that are party to the
investment treaty in question, as opposed to the expectations of the investor while deciding
to invest. From this perspective, the only point that the above finding of the tribunal in BG
Group v. Argentina makes is that the legal standard for “reasonableness” should be
understood in light of how it was intended by the all States party to the investment treaty in

question, and not as per one State’s unilateral understanding.

This uncontroversial point is no different from what this Tribunal has already emphasised
above, i.e., the importance of objectively understanding the Impairment Clause pursuant to
Article 31 VCLT, i.e., as per its ordinary meaning, taking into account the context, object
and purpose of the ECT (see {| 937-938 above). Of course, this understanding cannot be
devoid of the assurances or promises made to investors at the time they decided to invest,
since the Impairment Clause, like the FET standard, requires a balancing exercise of all
relevant circumstances. However, the above quoted findings in BG Group v. Argentina
cannot be read as excluding the importance of the host State’s regulatory powers, which is
an important objective that the States party to the ECT desired to protect. In any event, the
Tribunal is mindful that the tribunal in BG Group v. Argentina was not interpreting the
ECT, but was discussing the standard of unreasonableness under another bilateral

investment treaty.

SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

In the context of the ECT, the Tribunal finds the articulation of the legal standard for
unreasonableness laid down by the tribunal in AES v. Hungary to be appropriate:
There are two elements that require to be analyzed to determine whether a

state’s act was unreasonable: the existence of a rational policy; and the
reasonableness of the act of the state in relation to the policy.

A rational policy is taken by a state following a logical (good sense)
explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.

Nevertheless, a rational policy is not enough to justify all the measures taken

by a state in its name. A challenged measure must also be reasonable. That is,

there needs to be an appropriate correlation between the state’s public policy

objective and the measure adopted to achieve it. This has to do with the nature

of the measure and the way it is implemented.?!”
This articulation of the unreasonableness standard, relied upon by Respondent, is not in
conflict with the above discussed findings of the tribunal in BG Group v. Argentina relied
upon by Claimants (see {{[ 943-944 above). The Tribunal notes that the Toto v. Lebanon
tribunal’s findings, also relied upon by Claimants, described an unreasonable or
discriminatory measure as, inter alia, “a measure that inflicts damages on the investor
without serving any apparent purpose”; and “a measure taken for reasons that are different
from those put forward by the decision maker”.°!® This inclusive description of
unreasonableness also focuses on the two aspects highlighted by the tribunal in AES v.
Hungary, i.e., the existence of a rational policy and the reasonableness of the act of the

host State in relation to that policy.

The Tribunal notes that in their submissions the Parties have not debated the legal standard
for a measure to be characterized as “discriminatory”. In this connection, the Tribunal
again refers to the contextual factors mentioned in {| 937-938 above, and notes that the
concept of discrimination, like unreasonableness, should be understood no differently than
its manifestation in the FET standard. To this end, the Tribunal agrees with the comparison

drawn between the FET standard and the standard for the Impairment Clause by BG v.

Argentina (see the finding quoted in { 943 above), and also considers it appropriate to
extract the following relevant findings of the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic:
The standard of “reasonableness” has no different meaning in this context than
in the context of the “fair and equitable treatment” standard with which it is
associated; and the same is true with regard to the standard of “non-
discrimination”. The standard of “reasonableness” therefore requires, in this
context as well, a showing that the State’s conduct bears a reasonable
relationship to some rational policy, whereas the standard of “non-
discrimination” requires a rational justification of any differential treatment of
a foreign investor.?!?
In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the legal standard to satisfy a breach of the
Impairment Clause requires establishing (i) a significant impact on the investment by the
host State’s measure in question; and (ii) that the measure of the host State in question was
bereft of a rational policy, or unrelated to the policy objective that the host State desired to

achieve, or discriminatory in its application.

b. Whether Italy’s Conduct Breached the Impairment Clause

As mentioned above, Claimants allege a breach of the Impairment Clause with respect to
the following measures: (i) the enactment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree; (ii) the
imposition of the Administrative Management Fee and imbalance costs; (iii) the reduction
of the minimum guaranteed price; (iv) failure to reimburse sums paid under the
unconstitutional Robin Hood Tax; and (v) the arbitrary classification of photovoltaic
facilities as immovable property were unreasonable (see {| 926 above). In response,
Respondent, in essence, reverts to its arguments relating to the breach of the FET

obligation (see J 930 above).

Barring the last two measures, the Tribunal shall examine each of the above measures from
the perspective of whether they are in breach of the Impairment Clause in turn. With
respect to the last two measures, i.e., relating to the Robin Hood Tax and the classification
of photovoltaic facilities as immovable property, the Tribunal has already found above that
these claims fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction for being “taxation measures” under

Article 21 ECT (see 584 above). Accordingly, Claimants’ claims with respect to these

325

951.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

issues shall not be determined by the Tribunal in this Section. For the remaining three

measures, the Tribunal makes the following observations.

With respect to the first measure at issue, i.e., the enactment of the Spalma-inventivi

Decree, the Tribunal does not consider it to have resulted in a breach of the Impairment

Clause. This is for the following reasons:

@)

(ii)

Claimants have not satisfied the pre-requisite for proving a breach of the Impairment
Clause, i.e., the existence of a significant enough impact for it to qualify as an
impairment under Article 10(1) ECT (see {| 936-940 above). In this connection, the

Tribunal recalls its findings in the previous Section, wherein it was determined that:

(a) the Spalma-incentivi Decree effectuated only an 8% reduction in the incentive

tariffs for Claimants’ power plants (see {J 851-852 above);

(b) asa result of the Spalma-incentivi Decree, by their own calculation, Claimants’
investment value fell by 19%, i.e., from EUR 138.3 million to EUR 101
million and their enterprise value fell only by 7%, i.e., from EUR 450.8 million
to EUR 419.5 million (see [| 861-863 above); and

(c) Claimants managed to sell their entire investment portfolio in Italy at EUR 104

million, which was a “strong indicatory of market value” (see { 865 above).

The above factors lead the Tribunal to conclude that the impact of the Spalma-
incentivi Decree on Claimants’ plants was not sufficient for their remuneration to
have decreased to anything lesser than a “fair remuneration”. In light of the overlap
between the legal standard for the FET obligation and the Impairment Clause (see {I
937-938 above), these same factors lead the Tribunal to also conclude that
Claimants’ investments did not suffer a significant impairment. Indeed, the reduction
in incentive tariffs, and the consequential reduction in investment and enterprise
values, does not satisfy the threshold of “significant” impairment. This is especially
when juxtaposed against the simultaneous decrease in the O&M Costs for

photovoltaic plants (see {| 856-860 above).

Claimants have also not established that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was
unreasonable, inasmuch as it was either bereft of a rational policy, or unrelated to the

326

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

policy objective that the host State desired to achieve (see {[ 948 above). Here again,
the Tribunal recalls its findings in the previous Section concerning the objectives
behind the enactment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree, i.e., to offset the increase in the
A3 Component of the electricity costs/bills to be paid by the end consumers since
2005 onwards. Claimants neither dispute the increase in this A3 Component, nor do
they dispute that such an increase was attributable towards the rise in costs relating to
the incentive tariff regime. Claimants only emphasize the foreseeability of this rise,

as a natural consequence of socializing incentive tariffs (see {| 853-855 above).°”°

However, the foreseeability of the rise in the consumers’ electricity costs/bills is
irrelevant to determine the reasonableness of the measure taken to offset this rise.
The Tribunal finds that the objective of reducing the burden on the consumers by
reducing the incentive tariffs was a rational policy objective. Further, the reduction of
the incentive tariffs for producers was, indeed, related to this policy objective. This is
evidenced by the fact that after the Spalma-incentivi Decree, the A3 Component, to
the extent attributable to the incentive tariffs, witnessed a reduction, as admitted by

Claimants’ regulatory experts, FTI Consulting.°?!

952. With respect to the second set of measures at issue, i.e., the imposition of the

920

Administrative Management Fee and imbalance costs (see {| 949 above), the Tribunal does

not consider these to have resulted in a breach of the Impairment Clause either. This is for

the following reasons:

@)

Claimants have not satisfied the pre-requisite for proving a breach of the Impairment
Clause, i.e., the existence of a significant enough impact for it to qualify as an
impairment under Article 10(1) ECT (see {{[ 936-940 above). In this regard, again,
the Tribunal resorts to its findings in the previous Section, wherein the Tribunal
concluded that the obtainment of a fair remuneration was not interrupted by (i) the
Administrative Management Fee of EUR 0.0005/hWh amounting to a mere 2% of
the entire operating costs; and (ii) the imbalance costs also amounting to only 2% of

the entire operating costs, as per Claimants’ own calculations (see {J 884-885

see also First FTI Regulatory Report, {ff 5.36-6.37.
Second FTI Regulatory Report, ff 7.14-7.16; Hr. Tr. Day 3, pp. 218:21-218:25 (Dr. Moselle Testimony).

(ii)

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

above). In light of the overlap between the legal standard for the FET obligation and
the Impairment Clause (see {| 937-938 above), these same factors lead the Tribunal
to also conclude that Claimants’ investments did not suffer a significant impairment
as a result of the imposition of the Administrative Management Fee and the

imbalance costs.

Claimants have also not established that the imposition of any of these costs was
unreasonable, inasmuch as it was either bereft of a rational policy, or unrelated to the
policy objective that the host State desired to achieve (see {[ 948 above). The policy
objective behind the Administrative Management Fee, as already determined in the
previous Section, was to cover the GSE’s management costs and its costs for checks
and controls. The policy objective behind the imbalance costs was to promote greater
accountability with respect to the imbalances created in the grid as a result of non-
programmable sources of energy (see {{[ 879-880 above). These policy objectives
appear to the Tribunal to be rational, and the imposition of the costs do not appear to
be unrelated to the objectives behind the imposition. Accordingly, the imposition of
the Administrative Management Fee or the imbalance costs do not constitute

unreasonable measures.

953. With respect to the third measure at issue, i.e., the reduction of the minimum guaranteed

price (see { 949 above), the Tribunal similarly does not consider it to have resulted in a

breach of the Impairment Clause. This is for the following reasons:

@)

Claimants have not satisfied the pre-requisite for proving a breach of the Impairment
Clause, i.e., the existence of a significant enough impact for it to qualify as an
impairment under Article 10(1) ECT (see {| 936-940 above). In particular, the
reduction in the minimum guaranteed prices by the Italian Electrical Energy
Authority’s Resolution 618 to EUR 38.9/MWh did not significantly impact
Claimants’ investments in the smaller power plants, i.e., Santoro, San Marco, Lenare

and Monaci, which were directly affected by the off-take regime.

Firstly, the Tribunal recalls that this reduction of the minimum guaranteed price for

2014 was immediately followed by the Destinazione Italia Decree in 2014 itself,

328

922

(ii)

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

which effectively equated the minimum guaranteed prices for all plants with a
capacity above 100 kW with the hourly zonal market price. Thus, as determined by
the Tribunal in the previous Section, all plants covered under this regime, including
Claimants’, would receive the hourly zonal market price per unit of electricity (see {I
901-902 above). According to the Tribunal, this cannot amount to a significant

impairment for the purposes of Article 10(1) ECT.

Secondly, taking into account the objective behind the off-take regime, i.e., of
ensuring economic survival of smaller power plants, a significant enough impairment
would have to inhibit such economic survival (see {| 896-897 above). Claimants
have not established that their smaller power plants were impacted such as to not be

able to survive economically.

Claimants have also not established that the reduction of the minimum guaranteed
price was unreasonable, inasmuch as it was either bereft of a rational policy, or
unrelated to the policy objective that the host State desired to achieve (see { 948
above). In this connection, Claimants’ submission is that this reduction was “sudden”
and was “not tied to any decrease in operating costs”.°?? The Tribunal is not
persuaded that the reduction of the minimum guaranteed price or the alterations to

the eligibility criteria for this regime was sudden.

The Tribunal recalls its findings in the previous Section that the minimum guaranteed

prices were revised by the Italian Electrical Energy Authority on a yearly basis (see J
895 above). Moreover, the particular reduction brought about by Resolution 618 was
preceded by Politecnico’s 2013 report, concluding that operating costs for producing
photovoltaic electricity was reducing over time. Given Claimants’ acceptance
regarding the reduction in the O&M Costs, notwithstanding the mathematical
divergences between the Parties’ calculations, the Tribunal finds Claimants’
submission that the reduction in minimum guaranteed price was not tied to any
decrease in operating costs to be unconvincing (see {{[ 898-900 above). The

reduction in O&M Costs was a justifiable motivation to implement a corresponding

reduction in the minimum guaranteed prices. Consequently, the Tribunal finds this
reduction to be reasonable within the purview of the Impairment Clause in Article

10(1) ECT.

Lastly, the Tribunal also notes that the aspects of discrimination that Claimants point to
with respect to all of the above discussed measures is that they singled out photovoltaic
energy producers from all other renewable and traditional energy producers (see {| 925
above). With respect to the minimum guaranteed price, Claimants also emphasise the
discrimination between smaller plants with capacity under 100 kW and other medium sized

plants between 100 kW and 1 MW, which were later excluded from the off-set regime.°”*

The Tribunal is not convinced that any of the measures were discriminatory for singling
out photovoltaic plants from other renewable and traditional energy plants. In this regard,
the Tribunal recalls that the standard for establishing discriminatory treatment requires
showing that there was no rational justification of any differential treatment of a foreign
investor (see {| 947 above). Treating photovoltaic energy differently from other renewable
or traditional energy sources does not satisfy this standard. The situation with respect to the
photovoltaic energy market was distinct from other sources of energy in many respects, for
instance, (i) the significant increase in capacity since 2005 compared to other forms of
energy; (ii) the resultant increase in the A3 Component of the electricity bills/costs of end
consumers, which was primarily attributable to the incentive scheme for photovoltaic
energy (see {| 853-855 above); and (iii) the simultaneous reduction in operating costs (see
{I 856-860 above). The above factors, especially the first two, set photovoltaic energy at
variance from the other sources of energy, and these differences are also admitted by
Claimants. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the differential treatment of photovoltaic
energy investors from other investors was backed by rational justifications relating to the
prevailing market and commercial conditions.

With respect to the reduction in the minimum guaranteed price and the limitations included
in the eligibility criteria, the Tribunal does not consider that the differential treatment

between smaller plants below 100 kW capacity and medium sized plants between 100 kW

and 1 MW capacity was discriminatory. In this connection, the Tribunal quotes with
agreement the following findings of the Tribunal in Belenergia v. Italy:

Italy’s differentiation between smaller plants, on the one hand, and medium

and big power plants with nominal capacity in excess of 200kW, on the other,

is not discriminatory because it is based on objective and legitimate grounds.

This differentiated treatment is by no means based on the national or foreign

origin of producers, but on their capacity, size, economic and commercial

dimension. Thus, differentiated treatment based on legitimate grounds leading

to special protection of smaller plants is easily justifiable so far as it seeks to

guarantee free competition in the energy sector.””°
Claimants’ allegations against the calculations of operating costs made by Politecnico prior
to the alterations in the minimum guaranteed price regime, specifically relating to the
alleged incompleteness of the data considered or the alleged inaccuracies in the costs
calculation,°”° do not render these measures discriminatory. Indeed, notwithstanding the
specificities of the calculations reported by Politecnico, the differential treatment of
smaller plants was backed by a rational justification relating to economic and commercial
realities, especially keeping in mind the objective of achieving economic survival of these
smaller plants (see {| 896-897 above). Thus, the Tribunal finds that none of the measures
Claimants complain against were discriminatory under the Impairment Clause in Article

10(1) ECT.

In light of the above findings, the Tribunal rejects Claimants’ claim that Italy breached its

obligations under the Impairment Clause in Article 10(1) ECT.

ARTICLE 10(1) ECT: UMBRELLA CLAUSE

(1) Claimants’ Position
a. The Legal Standard

According to Claimants, the Umbrella Clause under Article 10(1) of the ECT is broadly
worded to include (i) obligations of the host State, both, towards the “Investor” and the

“Investment” of an Investor of any other Contracting Party to the ECT, regardless of the

timing of the Investment in the host State; and (ii) both, contractual obligations and

legislative or regulatory undertakings by the host State.°””

960. Claimants rely on Article 31 VCLT to contend that the phrase “any obligations” in the
Umbrella Clause clearly indicates that the Umbrella Clause was not intended to be limited
to contractual obligations. Claimants refute Respondent’s interpretation that the phrase
“entered into” in the Umbrella Clause limits the scope of “any obligations” to only

contractual obligations.°?* In this connection, to support their assertion, Claimants rely on

930

scholarly opinions,°”? and decisions of other arbitral tribunals,’”’ rendered in relation to

Article 10(1) ECT or other similarly worded Umbrella Clauses.**! Claimants also criticize
the findings of the CEF v. Italy and Belenergia v. Italy tribunals in this regard, arguing that
these tribunals wrongly interpreted the Umbrella Clause to cover only contractual
obligations as distinct from other obligations arising out of the legislative and regulatory
framework. Claimants consider the Greentech v. Italy award to be more analogous to the

present case.?°?

Additionally, Claimants state that Respondent’s argument regarding the limited nature of
the Umbrella Clause under the ECT is particularly unavailing in view of the fact that the

ECT explicitly gives States the right to opt out of the Umbrella Clause.?*

With respect to the role played by Italian law to determine the obligations entered into for
the purposes of Article 10(1) ECT, Claimants’ primary argument is that Italian law, as it
existed prior to the legal dispute having arisen, is relevant to determine the existence of an
obligation. In this connection, Claimants contend that Italian law, in its evolved and current
state, cannot ex post bestow validity to a wrongful act that was committed earlier in time.
Claimants support their argument by relying on Article 3 of the International Law
Commission’s (“ILC”) Articles on State Responsibility and Article 27 VCLT, which
prohibit the use of internal law to justify a breach of international law. Along these lines,
Claimants again criticize the CEF v. Italy tribunal’s findings relating to the Umbrella
Clause, arguing that the role of domestic law in an Umbrella Clause analysis is limited to

determining the existence of an obligation.?**

b. _ Italy’s alleged breach of the Umbrella Clause

Claimants contend that Respondent breached the Umbrella Clause by breaching its
obligation to provide incentive tariff rates to Claimants for a period of 20 years, as was
undertaken by it. According to Claimants, Respondent’s obligation covered by Article
10(1) ECT arose from three different types of commitments made by Italy, i.e., legislative
commitments under the Conto Energia Decree, administrative commitments made in
GSE’s tariff confirmation letters and contractual commitments made in the GSE contracts.

As per Claimants, these three commitments should not be viewed in isolation, and the

legally relevant date when these commitments entered into effect is the date of entry into

operation of the plant in question.?>

In this regard, Claimants argue that (i) the enactment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree; (ii)
the imposition of a retroactive Administrative Management Fee on photovoltaic facilities;
(iii) the alteration to the minimum guaranteed price regime; and (iv) requiring photovoltaic
producers to pay imbalance costs were each breaches of Respondent’s obligations under

the Conto Energia Decrees and the GSE contracts.?*°

Claimants dispute Respondent’s assertion that the GSE contracts did not create bilateral
contractual obligations as they were executed in accordance with the legislative and
regulatory framework of the State. In support of this, Claimants rely on (i) Respondent’s
statements prior to the commencement of the arbitration; (ii) the Romani Decree; (iii) the
text of the GSE contracts; (iv) the opinion of Italy’s Procurer General before the Italian
Court of Cassation confirming that GSE contracts were private law agreements; and (v) the
pending cases before Italian courts concerning GSE’s obligation to pay the Conto Energia
tariffs.°°7

With respect to the Italian Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 in relation to the
Spalma-incentivi Decree (see Section IV.G(2) above), Claimants’ primary submission, as
mentioned above, is that Italian law post-dating the occurrence of a legal dispute is
irrelevant to the characterization of an obligation under Article 10(1) ECT. Accordingly,
Claimants dispute Respondent’s reliance on this Decision No. 16/2017 to argue that GSE
contracts were accessory in nature, and thus unilaterally modifiable. Claimants, in any
event, submit that the Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 was neither unequivocal
in its finding that GSE contracts were accessory in nature, nor did it consider any GSE
contracts other than those executed pursuant to the Fifth Conto Energia Decree. Under the

Fifth Conto Energia Decree, the model GSE contract had been altered to include a specific

clause that permitted unilateral modification of the contract by GSE. None of Claimants’
SPV’s contracts with GSE contained such a clause or were executed pursuant to the Fifth
Conto Energia. In light of the above, Claimants dispute the relevant of the Italian
Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017, and Italian law as it stands currently in

general.?°*

Concerning the minimum guaranteed prices, Claimants rely on separate contracts that were
automatically renewed each year, as another source of Respondent’s obligations.
According to Claimants, Respondent undermined its obligations in law, regulation and
contract when it (i) decreased the minimum guaranteed prices by more than 50%, resulting
in a price that was approximately 60% of the market price; and (ii) eliminated the

possibility of most plants (including Claimants’ plants) to benefit from the regime at all.?°°

(2) Respondent’s Position
a. The Legal Standard

Without prejudice to its objections to the jurisdiction and/or admissibility of Claimants’
claims under the Umbrella Clause under Article 10(1) ECT (see Section VII.C(2)b above),
Respondent disputes the legal standard advocated by Claimants in relation to the Umbrella

Clause under Article 10(1) ECT.

In particular, Respondent disputes that the Umbrella Clause under the ECT is broadly
worded and that it covers statutory obligations of the State. According to Respondent, the
usage of the phrase “entered into” after “any obligations” in Article 10(1) limits the State’s

obligations to only contractual undertakings entered into with the specific investor.™° In

this regard, Respondent disputes Claimants’ selective reading of certain international

arbitration case law,”"’ and distinguish others.24?

970. Respondent maintains that a literal interpretation of the Umbrella Clause under the ECT,
specifically the qualification of the phrase “any obligations” by “entered into”, clearly
indicates that the Umbrella Clause was intended to extend only to a State’s contractual
obligations. Respondent contends that if the intention of the Contracting Parties to the ECT
was to attribute to the Umbrella Clause a broad meaning as contended by Claimants, the
text would have stated “obligations toward an Investor” or “obligations due to an

Investor”.

971. Respondent contends that a contextual interpretation of the Umbrella Clause under Article
10(1) ECT also supports Respondent’s position that statutory obligations of the State are
excluded. Respondent contends that adherence by a State to its statutory obligations is
covered by the FET standard and, therefore, cannot be covered by the Umbrella Clause,
which by Claimants’ own admission “is specifically intended to expand the reach of the
Treaty’s protections to obligations that otherwise might not be covered by the Treaty’s

other substantive provisions”.**+

972. Respondent further argues that the legitimacy of the “obligations” under the Umbrella
Clause is determined based on Italian domestic law, as opposed to international law. In
particular, in this connection, Italy disputes Claimants’ submission that the Constitutional
Court Decision No. 16/2017 is irrelevant to this Tribunal’s Umbrella Clause analysis for

having been rendered subsequent to the dispute between the Parties. In support of its

argument, Italy relies on the tribunal’s findings in CEF v. Italy.°4

b. _ Italy’s alleged breach of the Umbrella Clause

At the outset, Respondent argues that the GSE contracts are outside the scope of the
Umbrella Clause as they do not qualify as actual contracts. In this connection, Respondent
recalls its submissions made in the context of Claimants’ claims of legitimate expectations
(see { 638 above). According to Respondent, the GSE contracts were in the nature of
accessory contracts, “a sort of appendix of legislative or regulatory provisions”, which
merely transpose legal provisions, and are, therefore, not covered within the ambit of the
Umbrella Clause. Respondent contends that the parties have no autonomy in relation to
determining the essential terms of the GSE contracts, and the relationship between the
investor and GSE was not synallagmatic or reciprocal. In support of its submissions,
Respondent relies on the CEF v. Italy and Belenergia v. Italy awards, and on the Italian
Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017. In particular, according to Respondents, the
Italian Constitutional Court in this Decision (see Section IV.G(2) above) confirmed the
legitimacy of the Spalma-incentivi Decree and characterized the GSE contracts as

accessory contracts.”4°

Notwithstanding the above, Respondent contends that even if the Tribunal were minded to
find that the GSE contracts were covered by the Umbrella Clause, Claimants have failed to
prove any infringement of these contracts by the GSE, the counter-party to the contracts.
Respondent submits that Claimants’ claim regarding a breach of the GSE contracts is
premised on an authoritative measure leading to an automatic modification of the GSE
contracts, rather than any specific conduct by the GSE. In this regard, Respondent’s
argument is that the duty to observe contractual obligations lies on the parties to the
contract and not on third parties. For these reasons, Respondent contends that Claimants

have failed to establish a breach of the Umbrella Clause of the ECT.°4”

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal shall commence its analysis by reproducing Article 10(1) ECT (quoted in its
entirety in { 587 above), in its relevant part:
Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an
Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.
(emphasis added)
The emphasised part in the above quotation from Article 10(1) ECT has been referred to by
the Parties as the “Umbrella Clause” in their submissions, and shall accordingly be referred

to by the Tribunal similarly in its forthcoming analysis.

To determine whether Respondent is in breach of the Umbrella Clause, the Tribunal shall
first examine the Parties’ dispute about the constituents of the legal standard to be satisfied
to find a breach of the said Umbrella Clause. Thereafter, based on its findings regarding
this legal standard, the Tribunal shall determine whether Respondent’s conduct, in the

present case, qualifies as a breach of the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT.

a. The Legal Standard

The Parties are in disagreement about two aspects about the legal standard of the Umbrella
Clause, i.e., (i) the relevance of the domestic law of the host State in determining the
existence of the “obligations” in the emphasised Article 10(1) ECT; and (ii) whether the
Umbrella Clause, in particular the emphasised part in {| 975 above, covers only contractual
obligations or also covers obligations arising out of legislative or regulatory undertakings.

The Tribunal shall examine these two aspects in turn.

With respect to the first issue, i.e., the relevance of the domestic law of the host State, the
Tribunal notes that neither Claimants nor Respondent exclude the role of domestic law
altogether. According to Claimants, Italian law, as it existed prior to the legal dispute
having arisen, is relevant to determine the existence of an obligation, but any evolutions in
Italian law after the legal dispute cannot ex post render an otherwise unlawful act valid (see
{| 962 above). According to Respondent, the legitimacy of the obligations under the
Umbrella Clause is determined based on Italian domestic law, as opposed to international

law, and there are no temporal restrictions on this role of domestic law (see {| 972 above).

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Although Claimants use the term “existence” of obligations to delineate the role of
domestic law within the Umbrella Clause, while Respondents use the term “legitimacy” of
obligations, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to resolve this linguistic or
conceptual disparity between the Parties. The existence of an obligation is a corollary to,
and indispensable for, its legitimacy. Thus, it suffices to state that both Parties are in
agreement that for the purposes of Article 10(1) ECT, obligations can arise under Italian
domestic law, and when that occurs, the question of whether and to what extent these
obligations exist is to be answered on the basis of Italian law. The Parties are, however, not
in agreement about the temporal significance of Italian law, i.e., whether an evolution in
Italian law after the dispute arose is relevant to determine the existence of obligations.

With respect to this disputed issue, the Tribunal makes the following observations.

Firstly, the Tribunal notes that, in support of their arguments, Claimants have relied on
Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and Article 27 VCLT, to argue that
these provisions prohibit the use of domestic law to justify a breach of international law.
Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides:

The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed

by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the
characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.

Similarly, Article 27 VCLT provides:

A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its

failure to perform a treaty. This rule is without prejudice to article 46.
The Tribunal understands the above provisions to codify the principles that a State cannot
invoke its domestic law to either (i) influence or affect the characterization of an
internationally wrongful act; or (ii) justify its failure to perform a treaty obligation. Thus,
the Tribunal agrees with the proposition advanced by Claimants that domestic law cannot
be relied upon by Italy to excuse itself from or to justify a breach of international law.
However, none of the above provisions, i.e., Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility or Article 27 VCLT, restricts the temporal scope of the domestic law that
can be considered by an international court or a tribunal in its determinations. In other

words, these provisions do not entail the consequence that domestic law, as it has evolved

after the dispute between an investor and the State arose, cannot be considered in a

determination of an international law breach.

Secondly, Claimants rely on investment arbitration case law to draw a comparison between
the role of domestic law to determine the proper ownership of property in cases of
expropriation and the role of domestic law to determine the existence of an obligation for
the purposes of the Umbrella Clause.*4* According to Claimants, since the role of domestic
law in the former situation is temporally restricted to the time “just prior to” the
expropriation dispute, the same temporal restriction should also apply vis-a-vis the role of

domestic law under the Umbrella Clause.*?

However, the comparison that Claimants attempt to draw to invoke a temporal restriction
for the role of domestic law is not convincing. The motivation behind relying on the
domestic legal situation as it existed immediately prior to an expropriation is that the
ownership of the property in question cannot be appropriately determined after that
property was allegedly expropriated. This is acknowledged by the case law relied upon by
Claimants, which states that “[i]f one were to set the date of assessment of the investor’s
ownership any later than the date of the first contested measure, a state could adopt a law
making it impossible for a private owner to prove ownership and thereby circumvent the
Treaty guarantee.”*°° Moreover, setting this “date of assessment” prior to the expropriation

assists in the valuation of the property in question prior to its expropriation.

These motivations behind temporally restricting the role of domestic law for questions of
property ownership are specific to cases of expropriation. The Tribunal does not see a
similar temporal restriction being required or warranted for the role of domestic law under
the Umbrella Clause. As the question to be answered here is whether and to what extent an
obligation exists under domestic law, the whole legal situation about the existence of that
obligation in the host State is relevant, regardless of when the investor-State dispute arose.

Thus, for a holistic examination of whether the Umbrella Clause was breached, there is no

basis to set a cut-off date for the role of domestic law or to freeze domestic law as it existed

prior to the dispute.

Of course, in the event that a host State were to extinguish an obligation that existed earlier
by unreasonably or arbitrarily altering ex post its domestic law, such an invocation of
domestic law can be challenged by an investor, and would then have to be examined in
light of the principles emanating from Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
or Article 27 VCLT (see {J 981-982 above). However, if the domestic legal situation vis-a-
vis the existence or scope of an obligation develops or evolves in time, for instance by
virtue of a domestic court’s decision, that factual development should be taken into
account while determining whether and to what extent an obligation exists for the purposes

of the Umbrella Clause.

In light of the above, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ argument that Italian law
is relevant to determine the existence of an obligation only in the form that existed prior to

the legal dispute having arisen.

With respect to the second disputed issue mentioned in { 978 above, i.e., the scope of
phrase “any obligations it has entered into” in the Umbrella Clause, Claimants argue that
such obligations need not necessarily be contractual in nature and can also cover regulatory
or legislative undertakings (see {| 960-961 above). Respondent considers that the phrase
“entered into” limits the “obligations” covered in the Umbrella Clause to only contractual

undertakings entered into with the specific investor (see {J 968-971 above).

The Tribunal notes that the phrase “any obligations” appears to be broad in its reach, as has
been pointed out by Claimants. However, in order to interpret the phrase “any obligations”
according to Article 31 VCLT, its ordinary meaning should be understood in light of the
qualifying phrase “has entered to”. This latter phrase adds the appropriate context in order
to interpret the scope of the “obligations” covered by the Umbrella Clause. In the
Tribunal’s view, the requirement in Article 10(1) ECT that “obligations” be “entered into”
with an investor or an investment of an investor makes clear that privity is required

between the Contracting Party and the investor or investment in question. As such, the

341

990.

991.

992.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT covers only specific obligations directed at a

particular investor or investment and not general legislative or regulatory frameworks.

This proposition is not disputed by Claimants, who submit that the privity or specificity
requirement entails the exclusion of “general obligations”, but does not exclude legislative

or regulatory acts that are “targeted [at] specific classes of . . . investors”.°°! On the

 

contrary, according to Respondent, the privity or specificity of obligations requires that
these obligations be preceded by an “activity of negotiation” between the host State and the

investors or investments in question, and thereby includes only contractual obligations.**

The Tribunal does not consider the Parties’ positions to be far removed from each other.
The condition of privity of obligations for the purpose of the Umbrella Clause requires that
obligations be specifically directed at, and accepted or relied upon by, the investor or
investment in question. This requirement would, in most circumstances, involve
discussions between the host State and the investors or investments in question, resulting in
consensual arrangements. While, in certain circumstances, unilateral legislative or
regulatory acts can theoretically create “obligations” covered by the Umbrella Clause, the
requirement of privity or specificity still remains. In order for any legislative or regulatory
acts to create obligations for the purpose of the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT,
such obligations would have to be directed at a small and well-defined class of investors
and/or investments. In other words, not every unilateral legislative or regulatory act
directed at investors and/or investments generally can source obligations for the purpose of
Article 10(1) ECT, but only those that are directed at a small and well-defined class of

investors and/or investments.

The above articulation of the legal standard for the scope of obligations covered by the
phrase “obligations . . . entered into” in Article 10(1) ECT is in line with the case law
relied upon by the Parties. For instance, in Al Bahloul v. Tajikistan, relied upon by
Claimants, the tribunal found that “it is clear that the obligation must have been entered

into ‘with’ an Investor or an Investment of an Investor. Therefore, this provision does not

refer to general obligations of the State arising as a matter of law.” Similarly, the award
in Noble Ventures v. Romania, relied upon by Respondent, although dealing with the
Umbrella Clause of another investment treaty, interpreted the phrase “entered into” therein
in the following manner:

The employment of the notion “entered into” indicates that specific

commitments are referred to and not general commitments, for example by

way of legislative acts. This is also the reason why Art. II (2)(c) would be very

much an empty base unless understood as referring to contracts. Accordingly,

the wording of Article II(2)(c) provides substantial support for an interpretation

of Art. II (2)(c) as a real Umbrella Clause.?*
With respect to the requirement of a small and well-defined class of investors, which forms
part of the privity or specificity requirement for legislative or regulatory acts, the Tribunal
agrees with the following findings of the tribunal in Jsolux v. Spain, which were quoted
with approval in Belenergia v. Italy:

The Arbitral Tribunal accepts that, in special cases, the laws and administrative

acts may contain commitments, in particular when they are specifically

addressed to foreign investors . . . Yet, a rule addressing national and foreign

investors cannot, because of its general character, create only obligations only

vis-a-vis the former, including when they are investors of a Contracting
Party.°>°

Thus, a legislative or regulatory framework directed equally at foreign and domestic
investors cannot create specific enough obligations in order to satisfy the requirement.
Accordingly, such legislative or regulatory acts cannot create “obligations” that can be
considered as having been “entered into” with investors or investments for the purposes of

the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT.

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that in order for “obligations” to be covered within
the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT, there needs to be privity between the host State
and the investors or investments in question. This privity requirement can be satisfied

either by specific consensual or contractual arrangements between the host State and the

b. Whether Italy’s Conduct Breached the Umbrella Clause

In order to examine whether Italy’s conduct breached the Umbrella Clause, the Tribunal
shall first examine there were any “obligations” within the meaning of Article 10(1) ECT
that Italy entered into with Claimants or their investments. Second, subject to the existence
of any such “obligations”, the Tribunal shall examine whether any such obligations were

breached by Italy.

With respect to the first issue, i.e., pertaining to the existence of the obligations, Claimants
submit that Respondent entered into obligations of a legislative, administrative and
contractual nature with Claimants and their investments. For the legislative obligations,
Claimants rely on the Conto Energia Decrees and their alleged guarantees of a fixed
incentive tariff for 20 years. For the administrative obligations, they rely on GSE’s tariff
confirmation letters, and for the contractual obligations, they rely on the GSE contracts,
including the off-take agreements promising a minimum guaranteed price (see [| 963-967
above). Respondent disputes the existence of any obligations entered into with Claimants
and or investments, primarily on the ground that the GSE contracts were in the nature of
accessory contracts, which merely transpose or supplement legislative acts. According to
Respondent, these contracts were therefore unilaterally modifiable and could not have

sourced any obligations for the purposes of the Umbrella Clause (see {| 973 above).

The Tribunal considers that none of the measures relied upon by Claimants could create
“obligations” that would fall within the understanding of that term in the Umbrella Clause

in Article 10(1) ECT. This is for the following two reasons.

Firstly, with respect to the legislative acts that Claimants rely upon, i.e., the Second and the
Third Conto Energia Decrees, the Tribunal considers that these acts do not satisfy the legal
standard for privity between the host State and the investors or investments in question. As
mentioned above, in order for the privity requirement to be satisfied for legislative and/or
regulatory acts, these acts have to be directed at a small and well-defined class of investors

or investments (see 991 above). In this connection, legislative and/or regulatory measures

344

1000.

1001.

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

that are directed equally at foreign and domestic investors, as opposed to being directed
specifically at foreign investors, cannot be considered as targeting such a small and well-
defined class of investors. Instead, they qualify as more general legislative measures that

are not covered by the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT (see {| 993 above).

The Tribunal notes that the Second and the Third Conto Energia Decrees, like the other
Conto Energia Decrees and the underlying Legislative Decree No. 287/2003 or the Romani
Decree, were not directly solely at foreign investors. Instead, they were generally directed
towards all producers of electricity through the photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, be
it domestic producers or foreign investors. Therefore, these legislative and/or regulatory
enactments could not create any obligations that would qualify for protection under the
Umbrella Clause due to the absence of privity between the host State and Claimants or
their investments. In this connection, the Tribunal agrees with the following findings of the
tribunal in Belenergia v. Italy:

The Italian legal and regulatory framework before the Spalma Incentivi Decree

and the Destinazione Italia Decree was clearly addressed to national and

foreign investors and thus could not be interpreted as creating obligations

specifically “entered into with” [the investors].°°°
In light of the above finding, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to
make any further remarks on the scope of the commitments made in these legislative
and/or regulatory enactments, i.e., whether the commitments amounted to a guaranteed
incentive tariff for 20 years or whether these commitments also insulated photovoltaic
producers from the imposition of additional costs, such as the Administrative Management
Fee or imbalance costs. Given that these legislative and/or regulatory acts did not, in the
first place, create specific enough obligations in order to be covered within the Umbrella
Clause in Article 10(1) ECT, the scope and extent of the alleged commitments made in
these acts need not be separately examined. Thus, Claimants’ claims relating to the breach
of Umbrella Clause, to the extent they are based on the Conto Energia Decrees, fail for the
lack of a specific enough obligation entered into vis-a-vis the investors or investments in

question.

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

1002. Secondly, with respect to Claimants’ claims relating to the administrative and contractual

obligations allegedly arising out of the GSE tariff confirmation letters and the GSE
contracts, the Tribunal is persuaded by Respondent’s characterization of these documents
as “accessory” in nature. The Tribunal has already discussed the motivations behind this
characterization of the GSE letters and contracts in its determinations pertaining to
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations (see §§ 821-830 above). Although those
motivations were discussed particularly in the context of Claimants’ Fiumicino power

plant, they apply equally to all of Claimants’ other power plants.

1003.As already determined above, the consequence of this accessory nature of the GSE

instruments was that they could not create any commitments above and beyond the primary
legislative and/or regulatory acts that they were sourced in, i.e., the Legislative Decree No.
387/2003 or the Second and Third Conto Energia Decrees in the present case (see {] 823
above). Given that the Tribunal has found that these legislative and/or regulatory acts did
not create any obligations for the purposes of the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT,

the GSE tariff confirmation letters or contracts also could not create any such obligations.

1004. Another consequence of the accessory nature of the GSE instruments that the Tribunal

determined above was that, as a matter of Italian law, they could be unilaterally modified
by the public authority in question, i.e., GSE (see {| 827 above). In this regard, the Tribunal
also found that it was persuaded by Respondent’s reliance on the Italian Constitutional
Court’s Decision No. 16/2017, and was, in turn, not convinced by Claimants’ criticisms of

the said Decision (see {[ 829 above).

1005.To recall, the Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 had confirmed that the GSE

contracts were “accessory to the provisions granting the incentives”, and were not “private
law contracts”.°>’ The Tribunal has determined in the previous sub-Section that Italian
domestic law is relevant to examine the existence of “obligations” for the purposes of the
Umbrella Clause, and for such an examination, any evolutions in domestic law after the
dispute between the investors and the host State has arisen should also be considered (see

{1 985 and 987 above). Accordingly, the Tribunal does not exclude the Italian

REX-032, Italian Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 of 7 December 2016, {{ 11.

346

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 from the purview of its considerations merely
because it was rendered after the dispute between Claimants and Respondent arose. The
Constitutional Court’s Decision No. 16/2017, instead, presents an authoritative
understanding of the GSE instruments, and therefore informs the Tribunal’s determinations
of the nature of the obligations created by the GSE tariff confirmation letters and/or

contracts.

1006.Furthermore, the Tribunal has already rejected Claimants’ arguments discrediting the

Constitutional Court Decision No. 16/2017 based on various factors such as (i) the
language of the Romani Decree; (ii) the text of the GSE contracts; and (iii) the opinion of
Italy’s Procurer General before the Italian Constitutional Court and the Cour de
Cassazione confirming that GSE contracts were private law agreements (see {[ 829 above).
These factors, in the Tribunal’s view, could not interfere with the accessory nature of the
GSE letters and contracts, since the context in which these GSE instruments were issued
evidence such an accessory nature clearly. For the same reasons, the fact that various cases
pertaining to the alleged breaches of other GSE contracts are pending before Italian courts
(see {[ 965 above) is also irrelevant for the considerations relating to the nature of the GSE

letters or contracts.

1007. The Tribunal has found the Italian Constitutional Court’s findings in Decision No. 16/2017

concerning the accessory nature of the GSE instruments to be clear. In the face of the
Italian Constitutional Court’s clear findings, the Tribunal considers that the GSE tariff
confirmation letters and/or the GSE contracts could not have created any obligations under
Italian law for a fixed incentive tariff for a period of 20 years. In turn, there are no
obligations that exist in order for them to be covered by the Umbrella Clause in Article
10(1) ECT. The Tribunal notes that these clear findings of the Italian Constitutional Court
Decision No. 16/2017 have similarly influenced the determinations of other investment
arbitration tribunals in relation to the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT, for instance,
the tribunals in Belenergia v. Italy’ and CEF v. Italy (see {| 827 and 829 above). In this
regard, the Tribunal endorses Respondent’s reliance on the following passages of the

award in CEF v. Italy:

CL-195, Belenergia S.A. v. Italy, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/40, Award, {{] 579-580

347

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

The Tribunal is, therefore, compelled to the conclusion that the obligations
which Respondent entered into with Claimant’s Investments . . . were, as a
matter of Italian law subject to unilateral modification by Respondent. The
GSE Agreements are all subject to Italian law, and the awards which Claimant
cite do not have the effect of overriding a choice of governing law made by the
parties thereto. The obligations of Respondent which it owed to Claimant’s
Investments were delineated by Italian law, which (when revealed by the
Italian Constitutional Court to be accessory in nature) allowed it to unilaterally
modify such obligations.

In such circumstances, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant’s Umbrella Clause
claims as argued for by it and summarised in its Opening Presentation at the
hearing.”*?
1008.In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the GSE tariff confirmation letters and/or the
GSE contracts also did not create any obligations under Italian law that the incentive tariffs
granted to Claimants’ power plants would be fixed for a period of 20 years. Any
commitments under these instruments were unilaterally modifiable, and were subject to

subsequent changes in the Italian legislative and/or regulatory regime.

1009. The Tribunal finds that the same holds true for the off-take agreements that were entered
into by GSE with respect to the minimum guaranteed prices for Claimants’ smaller power
plants. As mentioned above, these agreements were also created as accessories to the
legislative and/or regulatory regime created by Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and the
Italian Electrical Energy Authority’s Resolution 280/2007. Further, these off-take
agreements, in fact, specifically provided that the GSE could unilaterally terminate or
modify them (see {| 894 above). Thus, Respondent was not obligated to maintain the
minimum guaranteed price at a particular rate or within a particular range further to these
off-take agreements, nor did the underlying legislative and/or regulatory regime obligate

Respondent to do so.

1010. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent did not have any obligations that it had
entered into with Claimants or their investments for the purposes of the Umbrella Clause in

Article 10(1) ECT, either in respect of the Conto Energia Decrees’ incentive tariff regime

or in respect of the off-take regime. Consequently, Claimants’ claims relating to breach of

the Umbrella Clause fails.

In light of the above findings, it is no longer necessary for the Tribunal to independently
determine the second issue mentioned in { 996 above, i.e., whether Respondent breached
any of its obligations resulting in a violation of the Umbrella Clause. In this connection,
Claimants have invoked (i) the enactment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree; (ii) the
imposition of a Administrative Management Fee and the imbalance costs on photovoltaic
facilities; or (iii) the alteration to the minimum guaranteed price regime (see {| 964), as
instances of breaches of the Umbrella Clause. Since it has been found that there were no
obligations, in the first place, that were entered into between Italy and Claimants or their
investments for the purposes of the Umbrella Clause, there could not have been any

breaches of obligations that would in turn violate the Umbrella Clause.

QUANTUM

The Tribunal notes that Claimants have claimed compensation in the amount of EUR 40.89
million arising as a result of Respondent’s alleged breaches of the FET obligation, the
Impairment Clause and the Umbrella Clause (see {| 280 above). Respondent has disputed
Claimants’ entitlement to compensation in this amount. In this connection, the Parties have
made submissions, and filed their respective quantum expert reports, relating to the
financial impact of the various measures at issue and the quantification of Claimants’

alleged damages and the resulting compensation.

Given that the Tribunal has rejected all of Claimants’ claims relating to Respondent’s
alleged breaches of the FET obligation, the Impairment Clause and the Umbrella Clause,
the Tribunal finds that Respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to Claimants.
Accordingly, since Claimants have failed to establish Respondent’s liability under the
ECT, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to examine the Parties’ respective
submissions relating to the financial impact of the various measures at issue and the
quantification of Claimants’ alleged damages and the resulting compensation in this

regard.

X. COSTS

1014. With respect to the costs incurred in the arbitration proceedings, the SCC Rules distinguish
between “Costs of the Arbitration” and “Costs incurred by a party”. With respect to the

costs of the arbitration, Article 43 SCC Rules provides:
Article 43 Costs of the Arbitration
(1) The Costs of the Arbitration consist of:
(i) the Fees of the Arbitral Tribunal;
(ii) the Administrative Fee; and
(iii) the expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the SCC.

(2) Before making the final award, the Arbitral Tribunal shall request the
Board to finally determine the Costs of the Arbitration. The Board shall
finally determine the Costs of the Arbitration in accordance with the
Schedule of Costs (Appendix III) in force on the date of commencement
of the arbitration pursuant to Article 4.

(3) If the arbitration is terminated before the final award is made pursuant to
Article 39, the Board shall finally determine the Costs of the Arbitration
having regard to when the arbitration terminates, the work performed by
the Arbitral Tribunal and other relevant circumstances.

(4) The Arbitral Tribunal shall include in the final award the Costs of the
Arbitration as finally determined by the Board and specify the individual
fees and expenses of each member of the Arbitral Tribunal and the SCC.

(5) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the
request of a party, apportion the Costs of the Arbitration between the
parties, having regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant
circumstances.

(6) The parties are jointly and severally liable to the arbitrator(s) and to the
SCC for the Costs of the Arbitration.

1015. With respect to the costs incurred by a party, Article 44 SCC Rules provides:
Article 44 Costs incurred by a party

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may in the final
award upon the request of a party, order one party to pay any reasonable costs

incurred by another party, including costs for legal representation, having
regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant circumstances.
1016. Both, Claimants and Respondent, have claimed that the other side should bear their costs
of the arbitration and the reasonable costs incurred by them, inter alia, for legal

representation.

A. CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

1017.Claimants claim that they are entitled to recover all costs, fees and expenses incurred in
this arbitration on the basis of the so-called “loser pays” principle. According to Claimants,
since they should prevail in this arbitration due to the harm caused to their investments by
Italy’s breaches of the ECT and international law, they should also, in turn, be entitled to
all the costs incurred in this arbitration. With respect to the “loser pays” principle,
Claimants also submit that it is not necessary for them to have prevailed on all of their

claims or to have been awarded all the full amount of the claimed damges.*

1018. In light of the above, Claimants claim costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this arbitration in the amounts of USD 3,895,283.80 plus EUR 1,274,072.33, together with

post-award compound interest at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal. These amounts

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

1023.As mentioned in { 1014 above, the SCC Rules distinguish between “Costs of the
Arbitration” and “Costs incurred by a party”. The Parties are in dispute with respect to the
allocation or apportionment of both these aspects of the costs of the proceedings. The

Tribunal shall examine both aspects, in turn.

(1) Costs of the Arbitration

1024. As per Article 43(1) SCC Rules, the “Costs of the Arbitration” consist of (i) the fees of the

Tribunal; (ii) the administrative fee; and (iii) the expenses of the Tribunal and the SCC.

1025.Article 43(2) SCC Rules requires the Tribunal to request the SCC Board to finally

determine the costs of the arbitration. As mentioned in {| 89 above, the Tribunal made such

353

SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy

SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

a request to the SCC Board on 10 March 2020. Based on this, the SCC Board, finally

determined the costs of the arbitration in the amount of EUR 393,169.44 (plus VAT). This

includes the fees and expenses of each member of the Tribunal, expenses for the Tribunal

Secretary and the administrative fee of the SCC in the following amounts (exclusive of

 

 

 

 

 

 

VAT):
Name Fees (EUR) Expenses Per Diem
(EUR) Allowance (EUR)
Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg 176,500 1,162.72 2,500
Prof. Klaus Sachs 80,000 2,865.06 -
Prof. Andrea Giardina 80,000 3,878.68 -
Arbitral Secretary - 1,662.98 -
SCC 44,600 - _-

 

 

 

 

 

1026. On the above amounts, the following VAT rates shall be applicable:

(i) _ The fees, expenses and per diem allowance of Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg: 21%;

(ii) The fees and expenses of Prof. Klaus Sachs: 19%;

(iii) The fees and expenses of Prof. Andrea Giardina: 22%. In addition to the VAT, the

fees and expenses of Prof. Giardina are also subjected to the Italian Mandatory

Contribution to the Lawyer’s Fund at 4%.

(iv) The expenses of the Arbitral Secretary: 21%;

(v) The fees of SCC: 25%.

1027.It is not disputed between the Parties that Claimants had advanced the costs for these

proceedings in their entirety, further to Articles 45(3) and 45(4) SCC Rules. The costs

advanced by Claimants, in this connection, amounted to EUR 499,500. Claimants request

the Tribunal to take this factor into account while apportioning the costs of the arbitration.

In addition, Claimants also rely on the loser pays principle to claim their entitlement to
these costs, since they believe they should prevail in this arbitration due to the harm caused
to their investments by Italy’s breaches of the ECT and international law (see { 1017
above). Respondent contends that it is Claimants that should bear the costs of the

arbitration in the entirety.

1028. The Tribunal notes that Article 43(5) SCC Rules authorizes the Tribunal to “apportion the

Costs of the Arbitration between the parties, having regard to the outcome of the case and
other relevant circumstances.” Thus, the factors to be considered while apportioning the

costs of the arbitration include the outcome of the case and other relevant circumstances.

1029.In light of the Tribunal’s determinations in the previous Sections of this Award, the

Tribunal considers that Respondent has prevailed partially with respect to its jurisdictional
and/or admissibility objections, and has prevailed entirely on the merits of the case, i.e., on
issues pertaining to liability under the ECT and international law. Although Claimants have
prevailed on the majority of the jurisdictional and/or admissibility issues, the Tribunal does
not consider that this outcome warrants allocating the costs of the arbitration to

Respondent.

1030. Further, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ submission that Respondent should

bear the costs of the arbitration since it has not paid any advances on costs. The Tribunal
does not consider Respondent’s conduct in the course of these proceedings to have been

prejudicial to the conduct of the proceedings in a smooth and efficient manner.

1031.Consequently, taking into account the outcome and overall circumstances of the case, the

964

Tribunal concludes that Claimants should bear the costs of the arbitration in their entirety

(plus VAT at the rates mentioned in {| 1026 above).°™

Although, pursuant to Article 43(6) SCC Rules, the Parties are jointly and severally liable to the arbitrators

and to the SCC for the costs of the arbitration, as between the Parties, it is Claimants that shall bear the costs of the
arbitration in their entirety.

(2) Costs Incurred by the Parties

1032. With respect to the costs incurred by a party, Article 44 SCC Rules authorizes the Tribunal
to “order one party to pay any reasonable costs incurred by another party, including costs
for legal representation, having regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant

circumstances.”

1033. There are two aspects to be determined with respect to the costs incurred by the Parties: (a)

the allocation or apportionment of these costs; and (b) whether these costs are reasonable.

a. Allocation of Costs Incurred by the Parties

1034. Both, Claimants and Respondent, claim that the other side should bear their costs incurred
in these proceedings. In addition to the loser pays principle, Claimants highlight “other
relevant circumsntaces” in this connection, i.e., the duration of the proceedings, the
complexity of the case, the amount in dispute, and the efficiency with which the case was
conducted (see { 1019 above). Further, Claimants also specifically submit that the loser
pays principle does not require them to have prevailed on all of their claims (see { 1017

above).

1035.The Tribunal notes that Article 44 SCC Rules enlists the same factors to be considered
while allocating the costs incurred by the Parties as the factors that were considered while
allocating the costs of the arbitration, i.e., the outcome of the case and other relevant

circumstances.

1036.The Tribunal has already observed in {| 1029 above that the outcome of the case was
entirely in favour of Respondent insofar as the merits of the case, i.e., the issues of liability
under the ECT and international law, are concerned. On the issues pertaining to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction and/or admissibility, Respondent prevailed in part, whereas

Claimants prevailed on the majority of these issues.

1037.The Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’ argument that the loser pays principle does not

require them to have succeeded in respect of all of their claims.°® The Tribunal notes that

352.

356

Final Award
SunReserve Luxco Holdings et al. v. Italy
SCC ARBITRATION V (2016/32)

the only jurisdiction and/or admissibility issues on which Respondent prevailed were the
claims relating to the Robin Hood Tax and the classification of photovoltaic plants as
immovable property. On all other jurisdiction and/or admissibility issues, Claimants were
the prevailing party. Thus, even though Claimants were the losing party overall, the
Tribunal is mindful that they did prevail on some of the jurisdiction and/or admissibility

issues.

1038. Moreover, the Tribunal is also convinced by Claimants’ reliance on other circumstances, in
particular the complexity of the case and the efficiency with which the case was conducted.
Keeping in mind these other circumstances, together with the outcome of the case, the
Tribunal considers that despite having lost their claims in this arbitration, Claimants should

not bear the entirety of Respondent’s costs incurred in the course of these proceedings.

1039.In light of the above, the Tribunal determines that Claimants shall bear 75% of
Respondent’s costs incurred in the course of these proceedings, to the extent that such costs

are considered by the Tribunal to be reasonable.

b. _ Reasonableness of Costs Incurred by Respondent

1040. Respondent has claimed an amount of EUR 990,000 or USD 1,136,351 as costs incurred in
these proceedings (see { 1021 above). In the interest of consistency with respect to
currency, the Tribunal’s determinations shall only use the amounts in Euros, and not the

amounts in United States dollars.

1041.Of the EUR 990,000 claimed by Respondent, EUR 70,000 is claimed as expenses, whereas
the remaining amount is attributable to legal fees and/or attendance at the Hearing and

telephone or other correspondences in the course of the proceedings.

1042.The Tribunal notes that Claimants have not challenged the reasonableness of the costs
claimed by Respondent, or vice versa. This is, in particular, in light of the Parties’
agreement during the Hearing to not have a second round of cost submissions.*° In any
event, the Tribunal finds the costs claimed by Respondent in the amount of EUR 990,000

to be reasonable, taking into account the duration and complexity of these proceedings.
