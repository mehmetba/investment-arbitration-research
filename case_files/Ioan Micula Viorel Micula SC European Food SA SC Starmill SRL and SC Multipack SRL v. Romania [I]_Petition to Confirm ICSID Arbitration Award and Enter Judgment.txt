Petitioners Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C. Starmill S.R.L.,
and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. (collectively, “Petitioners”) hereby file this petition and state as

follows:

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 2 of 10

NATURE OF ACTION

1. By this action, Petitioners respectfully seek recognition of an arbitration award
pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650(a) and Article 54 of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”),
and entry of judgment thereon. The arbitration award (the “Award”) was rendered in favor of
Petitioners against the Government of Romania (“Romania”) on December 11, 2013, following
an arbitration conducted in Paris, France under the auspices of the International Centre for the
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”). The Award imposed pecuniary obligations on
Romania in the amount of 376,433,229 Romanian Leu (RON) plus 5% interest, compounded on
a quarterly basis, with respect to certain amounts and periods specified in the Award. A true and
correct copy of the Award, certified by ICSID’s Secretary-General, is attached as Exhibit A to
this Petition.

2. To date, the Award has not been satisfied.

3. Enforcement of the Award has not been stayed by the ICSID Tribunal.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b). As
provided in Section 1650a(a), the “obligations imposed by [the Award] . . . [shall] be given the
same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction
of one of the several States.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

5. In addition, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330 because this
action is a nonjury civil action against a foreign state as defined in 28 U.S.C. § 1603(a) on a
claim for judgment with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity pursuant to

28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) and (6) and § 1610(a)(1) and (6).

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 3 of 10

6. Moreover, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-307) does not
apply to “enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.” 22 U.S.C.
§ 1650(a). Therefore, the Petitioners are not required to meet the FAA’s jurisdictional
requirements.

7. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

PARTIES

8. Petitioner Ioan Micula is a Swedish national and a party in whose favor the
Award was issued.

9. Petitioner Viorel Micula is a Swedish national and a party in whose favor the
Award was issued.

10. Petitioner S.C. European Food S.A. is a Romanian company in whose favor the
Award was issued.

11. Petitioner S.C. Starmill S.R.L. is a Romanian company in whose favor the Award

was issued.

12. Petitioner S.C. Multipack S.R.L. is a Romanian company in whose favor the
Award was issued.

13. Respondent is the Government of Romania. Romania signed the ICSID
Convention on September 6, 1974, and deposited its instrument of ratification on September 12,
1975. The Convention entered into force for Romania on October 12, 1975. Romania was
represented by counsel and actively participated in the ICSID arbitration that resulted in the
Award.

THE DISPUTE AND THE AWARD

14. On August 2, 2005, the Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration dated July 28,

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 4 of 10

2005, with ICSID. The subject matter of the arbitration concerned a dispute arising from
Romania’s introduction and subsequent revocation of certain economic incentives for the
development of disfavored regions of Romania (the “Economic Incentives”). Claimants asserted
that, in reliance on the Economic Incentives, they made substantial investments in one such
region, and that Romania’s premature revocation of the Economic Incentives was in breach of its
obligations under the Agreement Between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the
Government of Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the “BIT”
or the “Treaty”), which resulted in damages to the Claimants.

15. An ICSID arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) was duly constituted on September
12, 2006 and ultimately issued the Award dated December 11, 2013. The Respondent was found
to have violated Article 2(3) of the BIT by failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the
Claimants’ investments in Romania.

16. The Tribunal issued a damages award in Petitioners’ favor in the amount of
376,433,229 Romanian Leu (RON), as detailed in paragraph 1329(c) of the Award.

17. The Tribunal also awarded interest at the rate of 3-month Romanian Interbank
Offer Rate (ROBOR) plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis, from the starting dates included
in paragraph 1329(d) of the Award:

(a) May 1, 2007 for claims relating to the increased cost of sugar and other raw
materials;

(b) November 1, 2009 for claims relating to the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar;
and

(c) May 1, 2008 for claims relating to lost profits on sales of finished goods.
18. On April 9, 2014, Romania filed an Application for Annulment of the Award (the
“Application”) with ICSID. In the Application, Romania requested a stay of enforcement of the

Award under Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 52(5) of the ICSID

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 5 of 10

Convention, pending the outcome of its Application. On April 18, 2014, ICSID’s Secretary
General registered the Application and granted a provisional stay of enforcement of the Award
pending the appointment of an ad hoc Committee to consider the Application.

19. On May 12, 2014, an ad hoc Committee (the “Committee”) was constituted in
accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. On May 22, 2014, Romania filed a
Request for a Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement with the Committee (the “Request”),
urging the Committee to issue an order continuing the stay of enforcement of the Award pending
the decision on annulment. The Committee granted the Request on August 7, 2014, but
conditioned upon the provision by Romania of a written assurance specifying that it shall make
full payment of the Award if the Committee does not grant annulment and stating that such
commitment by Romania to fulfill its pecuniary obligations under the Award would be subject to
no conditions whatsoever (the “Assurance”). The Committee further held that a failure by
Romania to produce the Assurance within 30 days of receiving notification of its decision would
result in an automatic revocation of the stay of enforcement (the “Stay”).

20. Romania failed to produce the requisite Assurance. Consequently, on September
15, 2014, the Committee held that the Stay was automatically revoked, effective as of September
7, 2014.

21. On February 26, 2016, the ICSID Committee rejected Romania’s Application.
The ICSID Committee held that (1) the Tribunal had applied the 1995 European Agreement to
the dispute and had found that E.U. law did not apply; (2) the Tribunal had properly dealt with
the issue of enforceability of the Award; and (3) though the damages awarded were “collective,”
they were nonetheless properly proven. A true and correct copy of the ICSID Committee

decision denying Romania’s Application is attached as Exhibit B to this Petition.

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 6 of 10

22. The Award is thus final and not subject to further challenge before the ICSID
Tribunal or the ICSID Committee.

23. On April 11, 2014, Petitioner Viorel Micula filed an ex parte petition in this Court
for confirmation of the Award, in the proceeding styled Micula v. The Government of Romania,
Civil No. 1:14-cv-00600 (the “Prior D.C. Action”). On September 29, 2014, Petitioner Viorel
Micula filed an updated and corrected ex parte petition for confirmation of the Award. On April
16, 2015, the Honorable Amit P. Mehta issued an order denying without prejudice Petitioner
Viorel Micula’s updated and corrected petition, stating that “[a] filed plenary action must be
brought on behalf of all claimants to the ICSID award against the Government of Romania, not
only Petitioner Viorel Micula.” Case 1:14-cv-00600-APM (ECF No. 12). On May 22, 2015,
counsel for the Government of Romania appeared in the Prior D.C. Action. Case 1:14-cv-
00600-APM (ECF Nos. 16, 17, and 19). On August 31, 2015, Petitioner Viorel Micula
voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the Prior D.C. Action. Case 1:14-cv-00600-APM (ECF
No. 21).

24. On April 21, 2015, Petitioners Ioan Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C.
Starmill S.R.L., and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. filed an ex parte petition to recognize the Award in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, styled Micula, et al. v.
The Government of Romania, Case No 1:15-mc-00107 (the “Prior N.Y. Action”). On April 21,
2015, United States District Court Judge Naomi Buchwald issued an order and judgment
recognizing the Award. Case 1:15-mc-00107 (ECF No. 3). On April 27, 2015, Petitioner Viorel
Micula moved on consent to intervene and amend the April 21, 2015 order and judgment, and on
April 28, 2015, Judge Buchwald issued an amended order and judgment recognizing the Award

on behalf of the Petitioners. Case 1:15-mc-00107 (ECF Nos. 9 and 13).

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 7 of 10

25. On May 18, 2015, counsel to Romania appeared in the Prior N.Y. Action. Case
1:15-mc-00107 (ECF Nos. 18-20). On May 19, 2015, Romania moved to vacate or stay the
amended judgment and order. Case 1:15-mc-00107 (ECF No. 22). On June 15, 2015, Romania
filed an amended motion to vacate or stay judgment. Case 1:15-mc-00107 (ECF No. 30). On
August 5, 2015, the Honorable Lorna G. Schofield issued a decision and order denying
Romania’s amended motion to vacate and/or stay judgment. Case 1:15-mc-00107 (ECF Nos.
65-66).

26. On September 2, 2015, Romania filed a motion to reconsider the August 5, 2015
decision and order issued by Judge Schofield. Case 1:15-mc-00107 (ECF No. 80). On
September 9, 2015, Judge Schofield denied Romania’s motion for reconsideration. Case 1:15-
me-00107 (ECF No. 82). Romania filed a notice of appeal on October 2, 2015. Case 1:15-me-
00107 (ECF No. 85).

27. On October 23, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
issued a summary order reversing the orders of the district court, vacating the amended
judgment, and remanding the case to the district court with the instruction to dismiss the petition
without prejudice. Case 15-3109 (ECF No. 132-1) (the “Second Circuit Decision”). In its
summary order, the Second Circuit vacated the judgment “without prejudice to the Petitioners’
filing an action to enforce the ICSID award in compliance with the FSIA and in a court in which
venue is proper.” Id.

28. On October 24, 2017, in response to the Second Circuit Decision, Judge Schofield
vacated the amended judgment, dismissed the petition without prejudice, and directed the Clerk
of Court to close the Prior N.Y. Action. Case 1:15-mc-00107 (ECF No. 138).

29. To date, nearly four years since the Award was issued, Romania has not satisfied

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 8 of 10

its obligations under the Award.

30. Petitioners are in compliance with Article 54(2) of the ICSID Convention and are
entitled to immediate recognition of the Award in accordance with Articles 53 and 54 of Chapter
IV of the ICSID Convention, as implemented in the United States by 22 U.S.C. § 1650(a).

LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF

31. Article 54 of the ICSID Convention requires contracting parties to “recognize an
award rendered pursuant to the Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”

32. The United States is a contracting party to the ICSID Convention and is therefore
obliged to recognize and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by the Award as if it were a
final judgment of a court of the United States. This obligation is set out in 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a)-
(b), which provides in relevant part:

(a) An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the
convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States.
The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced
and shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a
final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one of the several
States. The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) shall not apply
to enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the convention.

(b) The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over actions and proceedings under subsection (a) of this section,
regardless of the amount in controversy.

COUNTI
FOR RECOGNITION OF ARBITRATION
AWARD PURSUANT TO 22 U.S.C. § 1650a

33. Petitioners restate and incorporate all the foregoing paragraphs of the Petition as if

set forth fully herein.

34. A binding arbitration award under the ICSID Convention has been issued in

Petitioners’ favor.

Case 1:17-cv-02332-APM Document1 Filed 11/06/17 Page 9 of 10

35. The United States is a signatory to the ICSID Convention. Awards issued
pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to recognition and enforcement in the United
States pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a.

36. Respondent has not paid the Award in full.

37. Petitioners are entitled to an order recognizing such arbitral award as a judgment
pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, 22 U.S.C. § 1650a and entering judgment
thereon in the amount of RON 376,433,229 plus interest on this amount at a rate of 3-month
ROBOR plus 5%, compounded quarterly with respect to the amounts and periods detailed in
paragraph 1329(d) of the Award.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that the Court enter judgment in favor of
Petitioners and against Respondent and request the following relief:

(a) Ordering that the pecuniary obligations in the Award in favor of Ioan Micula,
Viorel Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C. Starmill S.R.L., and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. and
against Romania be recognized and entered as a judgment by the Clerk of this Court in the same
manner and with the same force and effect as if the Award were a final judgment of this Court,
as authorized by 22 U.S.C. § 1650a and Article 54 of the ICSID Convention; and

(b) Ordering that, in accordance with the pecuniary obligations contained in the
Award, Romania shall pay to Petitioners the sum of RON 376,433,229 together with post-Award
interest at a rate of 3-month ROBOR plus 5% compounded quarterly with respect to the amounts

and periods detailed in paragraph 1329(d) of the Award.
