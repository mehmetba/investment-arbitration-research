CHAPTER I - PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

1. By letter dated 11 December 2007,! OAO Tatneft (“Tatneft” or ““Claimant’”) sent a Notice
of Dispute to the President, the Prime Minister, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Ukraine requesting that they open negotiations pursuant to Article 9(1) of the Agreement
Between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Cabinet of Ministers of the
Ukraine on the Encouragement and the Mutual Protection of Investments, dated 27
November 1998 (the “Russia-Ukraine BIT”).? Claimant alleged that certain conduct by
Ukraine amounted to “numerous breaches of the Ukraine-Russia BIT and, in particular, of
Article 2, Article 4, and Article 5, and Article 3 in conjunction with Article 2(2)” of this

treaty.

2. The Parties being unable to reach a settlement of the dispute, Claimant served on Ukraine
(“Respondent”) a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 21 May 2008
(“Statement of Claim”), to submit the dispute to international arbitration under the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (the

“UNCITRAL Rules”), in accordance with Article 9(2)(c) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.

3. | While Article 9(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides for a six-month waiting period
before such submission, Claimant has relied on Article 3(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT,
which requires Ukraine to grant Russian investors and their investments treatment no less

favorable than that granted to Ukrainian or third States’ investors and their investments; as

' Claimant’s Notice of Dispute pursuant to Article 9(1) of the Agreement Between the Government of the Russian
Federation and the Cabinet of Ministries [sic] of the Ukraine on the Encouragement and the Mutual Protection of
Investments of 27 November 1998, Exhibit C-25; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 21
May 2008, para. 58.

  

? Agreement Between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Cabinet of Ministers of the Ukraine on the
Encouragement and the Mutual Protection of Investments of 27 November 1998, Exhibits R-2, C-23. In view of the
fact that there are some differences between these two English translations on which the respective Parties have relied
in these proceedings, where one or the other Party has argued following a given version the Tribunal has so noted and
decided accordingly. No issues other than those noted have been argued by either Party to turn on any such difference.
The Tribunal, when quoting from this treaty in this Partial Award on Jurisdiction, has chosen generally to refer to the
translation offered by Respondent (Exhibit R-2) except as otherwise indicated.

  

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 7 of 92

the United Kingdom-Ukraine BIT? provides in Article 8(1) for a three-month waiting

period, Claimant has relied on this more favorable requirement.*
4. Article 9 of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides, in its relevant part:

J. In case of any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the
other Contracting Party, which may arise in connection with the investments,
including disputes, which concern the amount, terms of and procedure for
payment of compensation provided for in Article 5 hereof or with the procedure
for effecting a transfer of payments provided for in Article 7 hereof, a notification
in writing shall be handed in, accompanied with detailed comments which the
investor shall forward to the Contracting Party involved in the dispute. The
parties to the dispute shall exert their best efforts to settle that dispute by way of
negotiations.

2. In the event the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations within six
months as of the date of the written notification as mentioned in Item 1 hereof
above, then the dispute shall be passed over for consideration to:

[J]

(c) an “ad hoc” arbitration tribunal, in conformity with the Arbitration
Regulations of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL).°

5. In its Statement of Claim, Tatneft alleged that certain “actions and omissions of
Respondent constitute violations of its obligations to Tatneft under the Russia-Ukraine BIT,
in particular Articles 2, 3(1), and 5 [...1% and requested that the Tribunal order, inter alia,
payment by Respondent of an amount in excess of US$ 520 million for unpaid oil
deliveries and compensation in an amount in excess of US$ 610 million for Claimant’s loss

of management rights and rights associated with its shareholding interest in Ukrtatnafta.’

CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

In its Statement of Claim, Claimant appointed Professor Dr. Rudolf Dolzer as the first

arbitrator.

By letter dated 26 June 2008, Respondent appointed The Honorable Marc Lalonde, P.C.,
O.C., Q.C. as the second arbitrator.

By communications dated 24 July 2008, the above-mentioned co-arbitrators informed the
Parties of their appointment of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia as the presiding

arbitrator.

By letter dated 29 July 2008, Professor Orrego Vicufia informed the Parties that he

accepted his appointment as presiding arbitrator.

By letter dated 13 August 2008, the PCA informed the Parties that it accepted their request

Following the first procedural meeting,* by letter dated 27 October 2008, Respondent gave
notice of a challenge to Professor Dolzer pursuant to Article 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules.
The Parties submitted comments on the challenge and subsequently agreed that the
Secretary-General of the PCA (the “Secretary-General”) act as the appointing authority to
decide the challenge. The Secretary-General invited the Parties on 19 November 2008 to

submit further comments on the challenge, which they did.

On 19 December 2008, having reviewed the Parties’ further comments, the Secretary-
General sustained Respondent’s challenge and invited Claimant to appoint a substitute

arbitrator in accordance with Article 12(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

By letter of 16 January 2009, Claimant appointed The Honorable Charles N. Brower as
arbitrator, in accordance with Article 12(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

WRITTEN PHASE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

On 20 February 2009, as previously agreed by the Parties,’ Respondent filed its Statement

of Defense and Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility (“Statement of Defense”).

On 24 February 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, invited Claimant to
submit its comments on the request Respondent made in its Statement of Defense that the
Tribunal rule on the issue of jurisdiction as a preliminary question, in accordance with

Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

By letter dated 10 March 2009, Claimant submitted its comments on Respondent’s request

and submitted, inter alia, that the request should be denied.

On 12 March 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that
the Tribunal had decided to accept the proposed bifurcation. The Parties were invited to

agree on a timetable for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings by 23 March 2009.

By letters dated 23 March 2009, Claimant and Respondent each wrote to the Tribunal
informing it that the Parties had not been able to reach an agreement on a timetable for the

jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.

By letter dated 30 March 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the
Parties that the Tribunal had reached a determination regarding the timetable for the
jurisdictional phase of the proceedings. Its decision stated that there was no need for a
resubmission of Statement and Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility on the part of
Respondent; that Claimant would have 90 days from the date of this letter to submit its
Answer to such Objections; that Respondent would thereafter have 60 days for a Reply to

such Answer; and that Claimant would then have 60 days for a Rejoinder to the Reply.

On 12 May 2009, Mr. Eric Schwartz informed the Tribunal that having joined the law firm
of King & Spalding he would continue to represent Ukraine in the arbitration, along with

Messrs James Castello, Alain Farhad, and theirr co-counsel at Grischenko & Partners.

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 11 of 92

On 29 June 2009, Claimant filed its Answer to Respondent’s Statement of Defense and
Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility (“Answer”), in accordance with the timetable

provided for in the PCA’s letter dated 30 March 2009.

By letter dated 10 August 2009, Respondent informed the Tribunal that, due to the
unavailability of numerous institutions and individuals in Ukraine during the summer
holidays, it would not be in a position to submit its Reply on Jurisdiction within 60 days of
receiving Claimant’s Answer. Respondent applied for an extension of the filing date from

28 August 2009 to 30 September 2009.

By letter dated 11 August 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, invited

Claimant to comment on Respondent’s letter of 10 August 2009.

By letter dated 13 August 2009, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would be prepared
to agree to an extension of Respondent’s deadline for submission of its Reply from 28
August 2009 to 21 September 2009, provided that Claimant’s deadline for submission of its

Rejoinder was extended concomitantly, from 27 October 2009 to 14 December 2009.

By letter dated 13 August 2009, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it opposed
Claimant’s proposal of an extension until 21 September 2009 and that it had requested an

extension until the 30 September 2009 because the full extension was needed.

By letter dated 17 August 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the
Parties that Respondent’s request to have the deadline for submission of its Reply on
Jurisdiction extended until 30 September 2009 was granted, and that Claimant would be

afforded the same extension of its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, until 30 November 2009.

By letter dated 24 August 2009, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting an additional
extension of its deadline for submission of its Rejoinder to Jurisdiction, from 30 November
2009 to 14 December 2009. Claimant noted that it had been authorized by Respondent to

state that Respondent did not object to such an extension.

By letter dated 31 August 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the
Parties that Claimant’s request dated 24 August 2009 had been granted and its deadline for

submission of its Rejoinder would be amended in the agreed timetable to 14 December

2009. The PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, further informed the Parties that the

dates agreed upon for the hearing (29-31 March 2010) remained unchanged.

On 30 September 2009, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction (“Reply”), in accordance
with the timetable provided for in the PCA’s letters dated 30 March 2009, 17 August 2009
and 31 August 2009.

On 14 December 2009, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“Rejoinder’), in
accordance with the timetable provided for in the PCA’s letters dated 30 March 2009, 17
August 2009 and 31 August 2009.

By letter dated 25 January 2010, Respondent requested that the Tribunal order Claimant to
produce to the Tribunal and Respondent certain documents which Respondent believed to

310

be “important for the determinations the Tribunal must soon make”™ regarding the

jurisdictional dispute between the Parties.

By letter dated 27 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, invited
Claimant to submit its comments on Respondent’s request of 25 January 2010 by 2

February 2010.

By letter dated 2 February 2010, Claimant submitted reasons for which it believed

Respondent’s request filed on 25 January 2010 should be rejected.

By letter dated 9 February 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed
the Parties of the Tribunal’s following decision with respect to Respondent’s request

(referred to below as the “Request’”):

J. The Tribunal notes that document production is primarily designed to assist
the Parties in the preparation of their written pleadings, rather than their oral
pleadings. In addition, the arguments raised in the Claimant’s Rejoinder have
long been known to the Respondent. Any document request from the Respondent
should have been filed following the submission in June 2009 of the Claimant’s
Answer to the Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility, in which
the Claimant’s arguments were originally submitted. In view of the foregoing and
the long-established schedule of this case, the Request has been submitted at too
late a stage to be accepted by this Tribunal.

2. As the Parties may recall, the Tribunal granted in August 2009 the one-month
extension of time requested by the Respondent to file its Reply, on the
understanding that this extension would not jeopardize the hearing dates that
were being considered at the time, namely March 29-31, 2010. Later that month,
the Tribunal also granted the extension of time that the Claimant requested to file
its Rejoinder, and expressly confirmed that the hearing would be held on the
above-mentioned dates. Due to the tardiness of the Request, it would be very
difficult, if not impossible, to accommodate it without disrupting the hearing, a
step which the Tribunal is not prepared to take.

3. For the reasons set out above, the Request is denied. Without prejudice to the
Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction, the Parties are further advised that if the
Tribunal were to decide to join some jurisdictional issues to the merits, it would
again assess whether the documentary evidence before it is sufficient. The
Tribunal would have the opportunity to request the production of additional
evidence relevant to these issues in the second phase of the proceedings. So
would the Parties in their written pleadings on the merits.

By letter dated 17 February 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated
Procedural Order No. 2 to the Parties concerning the organization of the hearing on

jurisdiction scheduled for 29-31 March 2010.

By letter dated 26 March 2010, Respondent filed a request for leave from the Tribunal to

produce additional documents, attaching the documents in question.

By letter of the same date, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, invited Claimant

to submit its comments on Respondent’s letter of 26 March 2010.

On the same day, Claimant filed its comments regarding Respondent’s letter, along with
new legal authorities. Claimant did not object to the admission of the new documents filed
by Respondent but indicated that it “would expect that should it seek leave to file new
exhibits of its own in the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration, Claimant would be

afforded the same treatment."

By letter dated 28 March 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the
Parties of the Tribunal’s decision (i) to admit the new documents that both Parties had
submitted on 26 March 2010, and (ii) to draw the Parties’ attention to the fact that the rule
prohibiting the submission of new documents “except with leave of the Tribunal for

exceptional reasons” remained fully applicable.

' To enable

Kremenchug Refinery was separated from its oil supply located in Tatarstan.’
its continued operation, Ukrtatnafta was established as “‘an integrated interstate economic
complex of Ukraine and the Republic of Tatarstan” pursuant to the Treaty between the
Government of Ukraine and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan on Incorporation
of Transnational Finance and Production Petroleum Company “Ukrtatnafta” concluded
on 4 July 1995 (the “Ukrtatnafta Treaty”). According to Article 4 of the Ukrtatnafta
Treaty, “the minimum amount of oil to be supplied from the Republic of Tatarstan to
Ukraine for refinement by the production facilities of the company [...] [would] be equal to
or greater than 8 million tons per annum starting in 1996, including up to 4 million tons of
oil in 1995." The purpose of Ukrtatnafta was thus to exploit the Kremenchug Refinery

124

efficiently and ensure an outlet for Tatar oi According to Claimant, because of its status

as the largest producer of crude oil in Tatarstan, Tatneft was to be the principal supplier of

oil to Ukrtatnafta under these arrangements.»

47. The conclusion of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty took place “within the framework of

992

performance ° of the Treaty between the Government of the Russian Federation and the

Government of Ukraine on Cooperation in Development of the Fuel and Energy Complexes
signed on 7 September 1994 (the “1994 Fuel and Energy Cooperation Treaty”).7” Among
other things, the 1994 Fuel and Energy Cooperation Treaty encourages the creation of joint
ventures and interstate companies as a form of cooperation to address the problems

affecting interconnected energy projects in the aftermath of the USSR’s dismemberment.”*

THE CONCLUSION OF THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE BIT AND THE 1993 INVESTMENT

COOPERATION AGREEMENT

On 27 November 1998, the Government of the Russian Federation and the Cabinet of
Ministers of the Ukraine concluded the Russia-Ukraine BIT, the treaty under which
Claimant brings its claims. The purpose of this treaty was, among others things, “to

992

develop the basic provisions ° of the Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Investment
dated 24 December 1993 (the “1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement”), a multilateral

agreement to which both Russia and Ukraine were signatory.”
THE EVOLUTION OF UKRTATNAFTA’S SHAREHOLDING STRUCTURE

Since its incorporation in 1995, Ukrtatnafta’s shareholding structure has undergone several
changes. Pursuant to the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, Ukrtatnafta was incorporated “on a parity

basis”!

and, in the words of the Parties, “as a 50:50 joint venture” between Russian and
Ukrainian interests.** Under the original shareholding structure, Ukrtatnafta was to be
owned 20.01% by Tatneft, 29.734% by the State Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan
on the State Property Administration (the “State Committee”), 49.986% by the State
Property Fund of Ukraine, and the remaining fraction of a percentage by seven other

shareholders.**

In exchange for its 20.01% share, Tatneft was to contribute “180.90 Million US Dollars in

the form of the fixed assets pertaining solely to operation of the oil wells on 22 oil deposits

within the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan [...] for the term of 20 years.”** Tatneft

did not, however, contribute those oil-related assets.>>

51. On 20 May 1998, Ukrtatnafta entered into an option agreement with Zenit Bank (the
“Option Agreement’), which acted as a trustee for Tatneft.° Pursuant to this agreement,
Zenit Bank purchased an option on the acquisition of 30,000 shares in Ukrtatnafta with a
nominal value of US$ 1,000 per share,*” and agreed to transfer the sum of US$ 30 million

to Ukrtatnafta prior to 1 June 1998 as payment for the option.**

The option allowed Zenit
Bank to demand repayment by Ukrtatnafta of the US$ 30 million “at any time” and at first
demand Ukrtatnafta was required to “return the monetary funds.” The Option Agreement
also provided that “the proposed participation of [Zenit Bank] in [Ukrtatnafta] shall be of
temporary character and is aimed at an ownership of the block of shares for the benefits of
JSC Tatneft until JSC Tatneft receives a license for buying out shares of a non-resident

from [Zenit Bank].’“° The term of the option was until 1 September 1998.4!

52. The option was paid for by Zenit Bank by 1 June 1998 using funds provided by Tatneft
under a trust agreement.” Shortly thereafter, at a general shareholders meeting on 10 June
1998," the 1995 Incorporation Agreement was modified“ following an expert reappraisal

of the Kremenchug Refinery* and the exit from the company of certain shareholders as

Sergey Glushko as Acting Chairman of the Management Board.”

67. On 9 November 2004, following an application from Mr. Ovcharenko, the Avtozavodsky
District Court in Kremenchug issued a decision reinstating Mr. Ovcharenko on the ground

that his dismissal

[...] took place contrary to a court ruling prohibiting [Ukrtatnafta’s] supervisory
board from holding any meetings to appoint and recall the chairman and
members of its supervisory board, because the latter’s members were aware of
that proscription at the time of their meeting in question, because the supervisory
board there dealt with an issue which was reserved under applicable legislation
exclusively for the company’s general meeting, and because during its
termination of the claimant as chairman of the company’s management board, the
supervisory board was governed by such provision of the employment contract as
was at odds with Ukrainian employment legislation and was void. 100

68. Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated on 11 November 2004.'' In a general meeting of
Ukrtatnafta’s shareholders held the following day, the removal of Mr. Ovcharenko from the
position of Chairman of the Management Board was unanimously approved and the
Supervisory Board was instructed to consider the appointment of Mr. Glushko to fill this
position. ! The decision by the Avtozavodsky District Court of 9 November 2004 was
subject to various appeal proceedings, and was ultimately confirmed on 29 August 2007

day, Mr. Ovcharenko entered Ukrtatnafta’s facilities with “a squad of more than fifty armed
men and at least one bailiff’ and seized control of the refinery, its offices, and its bank
accounts.'°° Claimant contends that Mr. Ovcharenko’s conduct has deprived Tatneft “of
payment for oil already delivered and [has] prevented Tatneft from continuing to enjoy its
role as the principal supplier of oil to Ukrtatnafta.”'"” Since this seizure, Mr. Ovcharenko

has remained in control of the company. |”

According to Respondent, Naftogaz took steps to organize a general shareholders’ meeting
for the purpose of considering the replacement of Mr. Ovcharenko in December 2007.'°
However, because the representatives of Tatneft and the Tatar shareholders did not attend
the meeting, the quorum requirements were not met.!!° According to Claimant, Tatneft did
not participate in the general shareholders’ meeting in December 2007 because it had been
“deprived of its status as a member of a control block [and] was bound to be outvoted by

the very interests that had destroyed that block.”!"!

to pay for the oil.”1'8

CHAPTER III - THE TRIBUNAL’S CONSIDERATIONS AND FINDINGS

A.

75.

76.

77.

THE DISPUTE BROUGHT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL

The dispute brought before this Tribunal has as a triggering event what has been considered
by Claimant to be the illegal “seizure” and “forcible takeover” of the Kremenchug Refinery
by Mr. Pavel Ovcharenko on 19 October 2007, which, in Claimant’s view, had the result
that Tatneft failed to receive payment for oil shipments and incurred losses in excess of
US$ 520 million. Claimant also asserts that it has been deprived of its role as the principal
supplier of oil to Ukrtatnafta and that its investment in the latter company has been both
harmed and put in peril. The amount claimed in compensation for loss of management
rights and rights associated with its shareholding interest in Ukrtatnafta has been estimated

by Claimant to be in excess of US$ 610 million.

An additional claim in excess of US$ 1.3 billion has also been submitted in connection with
damages arising out of the alleged expropriation of the Ukrtatnafta shares belonging to

Amruz and Seagroup.

Respondent denies that it has taken any action or been responsible for any inaction that
might be in breach of the Russia-Ukraine BIT and submits that no damages have been
proved by Claimant. Respondent has raised four main objections to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal and three concerning the admissibility of the claims, requesting their summary
dismissal. Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction are premised on arguments against the
application of the Russia-Ukraine BIT to this dispute. First, Respondent argues that a
different treaty regime governs this dispute; second, Respondent contends that Claimant
does not satisfy the definition of investor as provided in the Russia-Ukraine BIT; third,
Respondent is of the view that Claimant has not made an investment under the Russia-
Ukraine BIT; and fourth, Respondent argues that even if there was an investment, it was
not made in conformity with Ukrainian law, and therefore does not satisfy the requirements
for protection under the treaty. Respondent also objects to the admissibility of claims
brought on behalf of Amruz and Seagroup, the admissibility of claims for unpaid oil
deliveries, and finally objects that Tatneft has failed to state an arguable case concerning
the alleged harm to its rights as a shareholder. As will be explained, this last objection was
later partially withdrawn. These objections are addressed and decided in this Partial

Award.

OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION

1. First_Objection to Jurisdiction: The Russia-Ukraine BIT Does Not Apply to
Disputes concerning Ukrtatnafta

Respondent's arguments

It is Respondent’s view that this case is not an investor-State arbitration but a dispute
relating to an intergovernmental project, the Ukrtatnafta joint venture between Tatarstan
and Ukraine.'?° Respondent maintains that since Ukrtatnafta was established pursuant to
the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, which in turn was concluded within the framework of the 1994 Fuel
and Energy Cooperation Treaty, a comprehensive regime governs the Ukrtatnafta project as

a whole, including the procedures for the settlement of disputes that might arise.!7°

Such procedures are provided for under Article 14 of the 1994 Fuel and Energy

Cooperation Treaty. Article 14 provides that:

Disputed issues arising between business entities of the Parties in the execution of
the agreements negotiated on the basis of the present Treaty shall, by agreement
of the Parties, be subject to review by state arbitrage courts, provided no mutually
acceptable solution was found theretofore.

Issues arising out of interpretation or application of the provisions of this Treaty
shall be settled through negotiation and consultation in accordance with the rules
of international law.'*7

The first paragraph of Article 14 refers disputes between business entities to “state arbitrage
courts,” which are explained to be the ordinary judicial commercial courts.'"* The second
paragraph refers issues arising out of interpretation or application of the Treaty to
settlement “through negotiation and consultation in accordance with the rules of
international law.” Also the Ukrtatnafta Treaty provides in Article 11 that the Parties “shall
settle all disputes related to the interpretation and fulfillment of the present Treaty by way

of negotiation and consultation.”!?? Disputes between “entities of the Parties” shall under

Article 12(2) of the latter Treaty be dealt with by civil courts, state arbitrage courts and

arbitration tribunals.'*°

Relying on the findings of the International Court of Justice in the Right of Passage case!*!
and those in the Tunisia/Libya Continental Shelf case,! Respondent argues that the
Ukrtatnafta Treaty regime is a case of /ex specialis that will prevail over any other dispute
settlement arrangements of a more general kind, such as those of the Russia-Ukraine BIT,
which is thus inapplicable to this dispute.'** Respondent notes, moreover, that as held in

134 135

the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions case ~~ and in the Southern Bluefin Tuna case,

the principle of /ex specialis also applies in the context of dispute resolution.

In Respondent’s view, any recourse to the Russia-Ukraine BIT would upset the carefully-
agreed dispute settlement arrangements expressly made by the parties to the specific
treaties governing the Ukrtatnafta project noted above. As noted in the Wintershall case,'*
protecting the parties’ agreement on a specific dispute resolution mechanism is a matter of
importance. Respondent also notes that recourse to the Russia-Ukraine BIT would put
Ukraine at a disadvantage as it could not bring potential counterclaims in relation to
Tatarstan’s oil delivery obligations because it would only allow for Russian investors to

BT Ty addition, because the investment was made in Ukraine, it

claim against Ukraine.
would not be possible either, in Respondent’s view, for it to launch a parallel “investor”

claim against Russia or Tatarstan to address the “complaints it might have concerning

Tatarstan’s or the Russian Federation’s defective implementation of the Ukrtatnafta

project.”"8

Claimant’s arguments

Claimant asserts to the contrary that the present dispute is governed by Article 9 of the
Russia-Ukraine BIT as it relates specifically to the fact that Tatneft is a qualified investor
that has made an investment covered by the Russia-Ukraine BIT and which is thus entitled
to its protection.” Claimant notes in particular that Article 9 of the Russia-Ukraine BIT
applies to “[a]ny dispute between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other

Contracting Party arising in connection with investments [...J7.4%°

Claimant further argues that the principle of /ex specialis applies “only where the parties

and subject matter of conflicting norms are the same,”!*!

a situation not present in this
dispute because the subject matter of the 1994 Fuel and Energy Cooperation Treaty and the
Ukrtatnafta Treaty are not concerned with investment protection but with pursuing
cooperation in the energy field and the establishment of Ukrtatnafta following the
dissolution of the Soviet Union.' It is noted that only the Russia-Ukraine BIT, signed
more than three years later than the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was concluded, governs investment
disputes, which is further confirmed by the fact that the Russia-Ukraine BIT makes no
reference to those other treaties and instead relates to the 1993 Investment Cooperation

Agreement. M8

Claimant submits in this context that the Russia-Ukraine BIT refers to disputes between
different parties and concerns subject matters different from the 1994 Fuel and Energy
Cooperation Treaty and the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.'“4 It notes in particular that this dispute is

not between “business entities of the Parties” or “entities of the Parties,” as provided for by

those other treaties, but it is a dispute between a Russian investor and Ukraine. '4
Moreover, the present dispute does not concern the interpretation or application of those
other treaties. In any event, even if the dispute concerned issues of interpretation and
application, this would not divest this Tribunal of jurisdiction as held in the Mox Plant
case’ or as evidenced by numerous situations of concurrent jurisdiction between

international tribunals. '“”

86. Both the Southern Bluefin Tuna case and the Mavrommatis case, on which Respondent
relies, are, in Claimant’s view, inapposite in the present dispute because the first did not
cancel out dispute settlement mechanisms in another treaty, and the second did not exclude

jurisdiction over issues which could not have been submitted to alternative procedures. '*

The Tribunal’s findings

87. This first objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction concerns in essence a question of treaty
interpretation as to the operation of the principle of lex specialis. The Tribunal is called
upon to decide which of two sets of treaties is to govern the present dispute as far as
jurisdiction is concerned. The first set, relied upon by Respondent, is the 1994 Fuel and
Energy Cooperation Treaty and the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, the latter being concluded “within
the framework of performance of” the former.'*? The second set, relied upon by Claimant,
is the 1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement and the Russia-Ukraine BIT, the latter
being concluded to “develop the basic provisions of” the former.'*°

88. The dispute settlement provisions of these sets of treaties, as noted above, lead in opposite

directions. The first set envisages negotiation and consultation for disputes concerning the

governmental disputes, and contemplates domestic court proceedings for disputes relating

to agreements entered into by “entities” or “business entities” of the parties.'? The second

set, however, provides specifically for investor-State arbitration when the dispute concerns

measures affecting a protected investor and a qualifying investment.'*>

89. This discussion involves issues that often arise when competing titles to jurisdiction are
involved. While in this case, in spite of the intense litigation before both Russian and
Ukrainian courts, no competing jurisdiction appears to have arisen between different
international tribunals, parallel rules on dispute settlement have indeed been invoked. As
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal depends on which set of treaties should be applied, the

question is also which international legal rules governing dispute settlement should prevail.

90. Although international law, or for that matter private law, does not thus far provide clear-
cut rules on how to solve questions of concurrent jurisdiction, there are nonetheless some
tules and principles that offer appropriate guidelines. The first such situation, not quite
common, is when a treaty itself will establish the jurisdictional priority or exclusivity of
one forum over another,'™ but this has not happened in this dispute. A second approach is

that resulting from the operation of the principle of lex specialis.

91. Claimant has convincingly argued that lex specialis requires identity between the parties

and the issues concerned so as to give rise to a situation where different sets of rules might

5

be opposed or contradictory.'* In this case, identity is not quite evident because on a

prima facie basis Tatneft and Ukraine are not simply “business entities of the Parties” or

‘5! Article 11 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty provides, “The Parties shall settle all disputes related to the interpretation and
fulfillment of the present Treaty by way of negotiation and consultation.” Article 14(2) of the 1994 Fuel and Energy
Cooperation Treaty provides, “Issues arising out of interpretation or application of the provisions of this Treaty shall be
settled through negotiation and consultation in accordance with the rules of international law.” See Exhibits R-1 and
R-7, respectively.

'S2 Article 12(2) of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty provides, “The Parties hereby acknowledge that disputes arising between the
entities of the Parties in the course of the conclusion and fulfillment of agreements shall be dealt with by civil courts,
state arbitrage courts and arbitration tribunals in accordance with the prescribed order.” Article 14(1) of the 1994 Fuel
and Energy Cooperation Treaty provides, “Disputed issues arising between the business entities of the Parties in the
execution of the agreements negotiated on the basis of the present Treaty shall, by agreement of the Parties, be subject
to review by state arbitrage courts, provided no mutually acceptable solution was found therefore.” See Exhibits R-1
and R-7, respectively.

“entities of the Parties” as respectively referred to under the 1994 Fuel and Energy
Cooperation Treaty and the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.'°° More complex arrangements and
participations are involved in this dispute as shown by the facts in the record. Whether
there is in this case a protected investor and a qualifying investment, elements which are
essential for the operation of the Russia-Ukraine BIT, will be discussed below in

connection with separate objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

In deciding cases of concurrent jurisdiction it is of the essence to ascertain whether the
same, or related, parties and the same, or related, issues are in dispute, for otherwise there
will be no conflict of rules. A Resolution adopted in 2003 by the Institut de Droit
International on the doctrine of forum non conveniens in private international law,
concluded that “[p]arallel litigation in more than one country between the same, or related,
parties, in relation to the same, or related, issues, should be discouraged.”!*” Tt can be
similarly concluded here that any concurrent international legal title to jurisdiction would
require identical parties and issues, and that even then parallel litigation should be

discouraged.

The Tribunal is also mindful of the difficulty to establish which set of rules is lex generalis
and which is lex specialis. Respondent, as noted, asserts that the 1994 Fuel and Energy
Cooperation Treaty and Ukrtatnafta Treaty are lex specialis because they were specifically
designed to govern the energy and fuel cooperation between Tatarstan and Ukraine and the
Kremenchug Refinery project, and thus they prevail so as to deprive the Tribunal of
jurisdiction over this dispute. Claimant, to the contrary, believes that only the investment
arrangements and the Russia-Ukraine BIT contain the applicable dispute settlement
provisions, and thus the 1994 Fuel and Energy Cooperation Treaty and Ukrtatnafta Treaty

do not govern this dispute as far as jurisdiction is concerned.

Were this dispute purely a diplomatic one involving two governments or States, the
Tribunal would have no doubt about the appropriateness of resorting to the 1994 Fuel and

Energy Cooperation Treaty and Ukrtatnafta Treaty in respect of their interpretation or

'S6 Article 14(1) of the 1994 Fuel and Energy Cooperation Treaty (Exhibit R-7); Article 12(2) of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty

(Exhibit R-1). Note, the “Parties” in this context refers to Ukraine and Russia in the former treaty, and Ukraine and
Tatarstan in the latter treaty.

application. But the dispute evidently goes beyond that framework. While the Ukrainian
State is involved as one of the parties, the other side consists of various entities that have
intervened in the origin and development of the project, including Russia, Tatarstan and
public and private entities. In addition, the main activities of Tatneft and Ukrtatnafta as
described by the Parties, namely the production and the supply of oil and the operation of a
refinery'* with a view to securing profits,’ are essentially of a business nature.’ It is in
the context of these activities that a dispute arose regarding shareholders’ rights and control
of the Kremenchug Refinery, and the alleged non-payment for oil deliveries. To that
extent, the nature of the dispute is more related to business investments and activities, a fact
that points in the direction of deciding for the application of the Russia-Ukraine BIT and

related provisions, subject to the jurisdictional requirements of the latter being met.

The Tribunal notes Respondent’s argument to the effect that the application of the Russia-
Ukraine BIT would put Ukraine at a disadvantage because it could not submit a
counterclaim nor launch an investor claim. Insofar as such counterclaim might concern
Claimant, there is no impediment to it being introduced because that is a right in
international arbitration, as envisaged under Article 19(3) and (4) of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules. If it concerns other entities, such as the Tatarstan or Russian
Government, the very same provisions of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty or 1994 Fuel and Energy
Cooperation Treaty invoked by Respondent would be available for it to take action in

respect of obligations undertaken by those Governments.

The Tribunal is also mindful that the Parties have invoked various decisions of international
courts or tribunals in support of their arguments. It should be noted in this respect that, in
all the pertinent cases, the Permanent Court of International Justice (“PCIJ”)—which was
instrumental in clarifying the issues associated with concurrent jurisdiction under treaties

between two parties—decided in favor of its jurisdiction in spite of requests to decline in

s. 43 and 46.

 

'° Article 2 of Ukratatnafta’s Charter provides that one of the primary objectives of the company is “to increase yield

and production profitability and to secure profits” (Charter of Closed Joint Stock Company Transnational Finance and
Production Petroleum Company Ukrtatnafta of 1995, Article 2, Exhibit C-120). Article 3.1 of Tatneft’s Articles of
Association provides that “[t]he Company’s main objective shall be gaining profit” (Articles of Association of OAO
Tatneft, Article 3.1, Exhibit C-26).

97. In the Electricity Company of Sofia case, the PCI took the view that new jurisdictional
arrangements should not be understood as necessarily excluding earlier arrangements. '*

Neither could of course earlier arrangements be understood as excluding later ones.

98. This interplay of dates is also to be noted in the present case since, on the one hand, the
1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement came ahead of the 1994 Fuel and Energy
Cooperation Treaty and Ukrtatnafta Treaty and, on the other hand, the Russia-Ukraine BIT
was signed after the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was concluded. None of it, however, bears on the
present dispute in view of the finding that the nature of the dispute under the Russia-
Ukraine BIT is in principle different from the type of dispute envisioned by the dispute
settlement arrangements under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and the 1994 Fuel and Energy

Cooperation Treaty.

99. The Tribunal must also note that the decision in the Southern Bluefin Tuna case argued by
the parties, in spite of having been much criticized in the legal literature, came to the right
conclusion in view of the fact that there were specific dispute settlement arrangements in
force between the parties to that dispute, different from those under the Law of the Sea
Convention. Moreover, as argued by Claimant, that decision did not cancel out dispute

settlement mechanisms in the latter Convention.'® In a different context, the Mox Plant

Court of Justice, where two treaties also prompted an issue of concurrent jurisdiction.'©°

100. Even if it were concluded that in this case the Parties are identical, this does not impact the
operation of the dispute settlement arrangements under the Russia-Ukraine BIT in light of
the conclusion that the dispute, due to its business nature, falls more accurately within the
ambit of such arrangements than any alternative mechanism. Thus, the provisions of the

BIT are to be regarded as the /ex specialis governing dispute settlement in this case.

2. Second Objection to Jurisdiction: Tatneft Is Not an Investor within the Meaning of
the Russia-Ukraine BIT (Objection Ratione Personae)

Respondent's arguments

101. Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the ground that Claimant is not an
investor protected under the Russia-Ukraine BIT because it is controlled by the
Government of Tatarstan, a fact that should prevail over Claimant’s assertion that its shares
are publicly traded in the form of global depository receipts and ordinary shares on various

stock exchanges in Europe and Russia.'®7

102. Respondent argues in support of this view that Tatarstan holds approximately 36% of
Tatneft voting stock by the intermediation of a company wholly-owned by the Government
of Tatarstan and other corporate arrangements.'* Moreover, the Tatar Government holds a
“golden share” which, as disclosed by Claimant to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), enables it to veto major decisions of shareholders,
including changes in capital stock, charter amendments, liquidation or reorganization of
Tatneft, and entering into major or interested party transactions, among other powers.'©°
Respondent also contends that Claimant does not provide any information as to who are the

beneficial owners of the shares not directly owned by Tatarstan. Respondent points to a

2005 report by Standard & Poor (the “S&P Report’) finding that more than 50% of

Tatneft’s share capital is controlled by the Tatar State.!”

Respondent further argues that the Tatar Government also controls the Board of Directors
of Tatneft as the Prime Minister is the Chairman of the Board and five other high
government officials participate in it, together with a number of employees of Tatneft.'7!
In the filing noted above, Claimant explained to the SEC that “Tatarstan [owns], directly or
indirectly, controlling or substantial minority stakes in [...] virtually all of the major

enterprises in Tatarstan.”!””

The control of Tatneft, Respondent further maintains, also results in the use of this
company by the Government for public policy purposes, such as maintaining employment
levels, expending on social assets, selling oil to certain customers or raising funds for the
benefit of the Government.'” Raising capital or paying debt for the Government has also
been a consequence of that dependency.'”* Respondent believes that the company is also
used to implement Russia’s geopolitical policies, particularly so as to reduce oil supplies to

certain countries not of the like of the Russian Government.'”°

The presence of these
factors is indicative that Tatneft is controlled by the Government of Tatarstan and is being
used for public, non-commercial purposes, particularly in relation to the Ukrtatnafta

project.'”°

In Respondent’s argument, Tatneft “acquired its shareholding in Ukrtatnafta only because
the Republic of Tatarstan designated Tatneft as a shareholder.”'”’ It follows that Tatneft is
in essence a vehicle of Tatarstan for the purposes of Ukrtatnafta.'”® Tatneft’ s participation
in the project was decided under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and the company was designated as

one of Tatarstan’s representatives in Ukrtatnafta. Further evidence of this relationship is

found in the fact that in October 2006 Tatneft and the Tatar Government entered into a
five-year fiduciary management agreement under which Tatneft proposed candidates for
the Ukrtatnafta’s governing bodies and voted the Government’s shares subject to

instructions of the Government.”

106. On this background, Respondent asserts that Tatneft is an emanation of the Republic of
Tatarstan, itself a subdivision of the Russian Federation, and should be treated identically to

the State.'*°

Whether a structural or functional test, or a combination thereof, is applied in
this case, Tatneft’s situation is not different from that of SODIGA in the Maffezini case, '*!
in which a private commercial corporation with State participation in its stock was found to
be governmental in nature because its aims were the development of new industries, with
the result that Spain was held internationally responsible for the company’s conduct
towards investors. The same conclusion was reached in Salini v. Morocco'® in respect of a

company entrusted with the development of public works. '*

107. In Respondent’s understanding, the definition of investor under Article 1(2) of the Russia-
Ukraine BIT does not extend to a Contracting State party to that treaty; it only refers to
“any natural person” and to “any legal entity” to the extent that one or the other is legally
capable of carrying out investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party, and
subject to requirements of nationality or incorporation.'* Although such reference to “any
legal entity” is broad, a State is a different category of foreign investor as understood under

both Russian and Ukrainian law. In fact, the Russian investment law of 4 July 1991

any legal entity, set up or instituted in conformity with the legislation prevailing on the territory of the given

considers “foreign states” as separate from foreign legal persons and foreign citizens;'* so
too the Ukrainian foreign investment law of 1996 considers “foreign countries,
international governmental and non-governmental organizations” as a category different

from legal entities and natural persons, '*°

Respondent takes the position that the Russia-Ukraine BIT does not refer at all to
investments by States or State entities and is only concerned with the case of individuals
and private companies, just as is the case with investment arbitration generally. '®”
Moreover, both Ukraine’s and Russia’s treaty practice has been to expressly include
government-controlled entities when they have intended to have their investments
protected,'** but this was not the case of the Russia-Ukraine BIT in spite of the fact that
various inter-governmental agreements relating to joint projects between both countries
were in force at the time the Russia-Ukraine BIT was concluded. When a State wishes to
protect its own interests it does not need to rely on investment treaty claims but can resort

directly to diplomatic protection and negotiations. '*

In Respondent’s argument, the basic principle applicable in this matter was noted in the
CSOB case'”” to the effect that State-controlled entities discharging governmental functions
or acting as agents of the government should not be treated as nationals of another
Contracting State under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, but since it was concluded
that this was not the case in that dispute the tribunal affirmed its jurisdiction.'?!
Respondent asserts that it is positively the case here and that that principle is not restricted
to the ICSID Convention but is rooted in the customary law rules on attribution, as

reflected in Article 5 of the International Law Commission (“ILC”) Articles on State

Responsibility.” Relying by analogy on the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,'”*
Respondent argues that Tatneft’s shareholding participation in Ukrtatnafta meets the test
for attribution under Articles 5 and 8 and relevant arbitration awards, and thus constitutes,
in the words of Mr. Zachary Douglas, a “sovereign investment activity” that does not

qualify for protection under the Bir.'*

110. In this context it is also argued by Respondent that it is not appropriate to examine only the
nature of the activity undertaken but also its purpose, which in this case is inextricably

related to governmental policies and functions.'*°

It is pointed out that in fact the
transformation of a former State entity into Tatneft as a joint stock company following the
demise of the Soviet Union has not resulted in independence from the Government.'”° The
shareholding structure explained above, coupled with the “golden share” privileges and
Tatarstan’s control of Tatneft’s management, are each expressions of such public purpose,
and so is Tatneft’s support of public policies and financial operations that only benefit the

Government.'””

111.

Finally, Claimant erroneously argues that its participation in Ukrtatnafta could not be held

to have been pursuant to government direction because, if this were true, Claimant would

8

have been entitled to immunity, which it was not.!°8 In Respondent’s view, Claimant

wrongly assumes that an entity that does not qualify as an investor under the BIT would

'3 Citing the Douglas Legal Opinion at para. 23, Respondent states that “although the problem this Tribunal needs to
resolve is one of jurisdiction and not attribution, ‘it is a problem of jurisdiction that should be resolved by reference to
the rules of attribution by way of analogy’.” (emphasis in original)

necessarily be entitled to immunity.'” In any event, Claimant did not raise any argument

involving immunity before the Ukrainian courts,”

Respondent concludes that Tatneft was involved in the Ukrtatnafta project to act as the
agent for Tatarstan and discharge its obligations under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, thus

furthering both States’ energy policies.”°!

Both the nature and the purpose of Tatneft’s
participation in Ukrtatnafta points to the exercise of governmental functions which preclude
the protection of this instrumentality as an investor under the Russia-Ukraine BIT, thus

resulting in the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction in this dispute?”

Claimant’s arguments

Claimant believes the situation to be quite different from the view put forth by Respondent.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the assets of Tatneft Amalgamation, a State-
owned and operated company, were transferred to Claimant, OAO Tatneft, a newly-
incorporated joint stock company." Privatization followed by the sale in 1994 of portions
of its shares to managers and workers, and after 1996 by public offering of depository
receipts in London, New York and Frankfurt stock exchanges.” As a result of this process
of privatization, approximately 65% of Tatneft shares are presently owned by private
shareholders unrelated to Tatarstan.”°> Claimant further argues that while it is impossible
for Tatneft, a publicly traded company, to know each of the beneficial owners of its shares,
it is clear that the Tatar Government owns no more than 36% of Tatneft’s shares, directly
and indirectly. The S&P Report’s conclusion that Tatarstan controls more than 50% of

Tatneft's share capital is simply unsupported.?°

114. It is further explained that only six out of fifteen members of the Board of Directors are
officials of the Government of Tatarstan.” The principal objective of the company, as any
other major oil company, is to undertake for-profit activities, and the fact that it might also
undertake activities relating to its social responsibility does not make it an emanation of the

Republic of Tatarstan.?

115. In Claimant’s view, Respondent has failed to prove that Tatneft is owned or controlled by
the Republic of Tatarstan, and not even the fact that the latter owns a golden share changes
this conclusion as it can only appoint one member of the Board of Directors and exercise
some other limited veto rights not unknown to many other companies.” The Executive
Board does not include any person holding a position in the Tatar Government nor is the
General Director a government official.”!° While filings before the SEC have been invoked
by Respondent to prove government control over Tatneft, this amounts only to a disclosure
of all kinds of risks that could give rise to liability if not disclosed, but does not state or
suggest that Tatneft is under such control.”!! Tatneft is also subject to anti-monopoly

legislation and operates in a competitive environment.”

116. Never has Tatneft exercised sovereign functions that could be equated to functions de jure
imperii, not even at the time of the Soviet Union, because it was a production unit the
mission and core business of which were oil drilling and refining.” Not even the alleged

financial transactions that Respondent invokes as evidence of government control amount

to more than one-time occurrences in the form of loans that were repaid to Tatneft."

Claimant further maintains that it does not implement Tatarstan’s domestic policies except
to the extent mandated by law to every company, and even less so does it implement the

Russian Federation’s foreign policy.”!

117. It is also argued by Claimant that its participation in the Ukrtatnafta project is not to serve
as the Tatar Government’s agent under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, but only to contribute in the
framework of the commercial nature of the project to the recreation of the integrated oil
production and refining complex that had existed before international borders were set

following the collapse of the Soviet Union.”

Also Ukrtatnafta was incorporated as a
commercial company to attend these ends.”!” It is not for Tatneft to perform the obligations
of Tatarstan as to the supply of oil under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and this could have been

done by any other company.?'®

118. It is also explained that at first Tatneft and Tatar Government officials attended the
Ukrtatnafta General Meetings separately, and the fact that later a power of attorney was
given to Tatneft to undertake such representation does not prove dependency but, to the
contrary, shows that since the outset Tatneft was not conceived as representing the Tatar

Government for otherwise those powers of attorney would be unnecessary.”"”

119. Claimant also argues that, in any event, whether Tatneft is a private or public company is
irrelevant for qualifying as an investor under Article 1(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT since
it satisfies both the requirement of having been instituted in accordance with Russian
legislation and being legally able under that legislation to carry out investments in
Ukraine.” Neither of these requirements excludes publicly-owned or controlled investors
which, moreover, are expressly envisaged as investors under the Russian investment law

1

noted above.”! Russian treaty practice also reflects this broad understanding of the

concept of investor, with the sole exception of the bilateral investment treaties of both

Russia and Ukraine with the United States because of the policy followed by the latter in

2

this respect.” Similarly, Respondent’s efforts to rely on the European Convention of

Human Rights so as to deny protection to public investors under the Russia-Ukraine BIT do

not alter such understanding in light of the fact that Article 34 of the Convention, unlike the
Russia-Ukraine BIT, excludes governmental entities from lodging individual complaints.””?
While Respondent cannot find any support in Article 1(2) of the BIT to exclude public or

mixed entities from the definition of investor,7*

Respondent’s analogy argument based on
the international law on attribution is equally unsupported.”?> According to Claimant,
“(here are no rules of attribution of general applicability under international law, and there
is no justification for applying the rules of attribution that form part of the law of State

responsibility as such to other areas of international law.””6

Claimant also maintains that, as held in Saluka, the “Tribunal cannot in effect impose upon

the parties a definition of ‘investor’ other than that which they themselves agreed.””””

In Claimant’s view, Maffezini dealt with a different matter, namely the requirements of
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as to qualifying investors, a situation not given in
the instant case because no such limitations apply to non-ICSID arbitration and because the

Russia-Ukraine BIT specifically contains a definition of investor.?"*

It is explained that
Russia is not a party to the ICSID Convention nor does the Russia-Ukraine BIT provide for
the choice of ICSID arbitration.” Furthermore, the 1993 Investment Cooperation
Agreement specifically includes “the member-states [...] and the state and administrative-
territorial entities,” thus including both public and private investments, an objective which

the Russia-Ukraine BIT has preserved.?*°

It follows, in Claimant’s argument, that Tatneft is a private commercial entity not

controlled de jure or de facto by the Tatar Government, and it does not carry out

governmental functions.”*! Should a structural test be applied to reach a determination, the
nature of Tatneft’s activity shows that it is different from the exercise of governmental
authority since investing in a downstream refinery to process its oil is not a governmental
function, as concluded in respect of another commercial activity in Jan de Nul?? If a
functional test were applied, it would lead, as in CSOB, to the conclusion that even if
Claimant were promoting governmental policies and purposes, these would not lose their

: 233
commercial nature.

It is further noted that Tatneft could not and has not claimed immunity from jurisdiction
before a foreign court, what might have been done if its activities were considered to be
jure imperii, as concluded in respect of the National Iranian Oil Company by the Court of

Appeals of The Hague.” Consequently, the Ukrainian courts would have been prohibited

from taking measures of constraint.?*>

124. Claimant argues lastly that all the cases that have applied the structural test to some effect
involve situations where the government’s capital participation is above 51% or effectively
designates or controls the company’s management.?** Any attempt to pierce Tatneft’s
corporate veil, as Respondent pretends, would be entirely unwarranted in light of the

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 48 of 92

The Tribunal’s findings

125. Article 1(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides that:

‘Investor of a Contracting Party’ shall imply: a) any natural person, who is a
citizen of the state of a Contracting Party, and who is legally capable under its
respective legislation to carry out investments on the territory of the other
Contracting Party; b) any legal entity, set up or instituted in conformity with the
legislation prevailing on the territory of the given Contracting Party, under the
condition that the said legal entity is legally capable, under the legislation of its
respective Contracting Party, to carry out investments on the territory of the other
Contracting Party.”
126. As summarized above, Respondent argues that Claimant does not qualify as an investor

under this definition.?”

127. The arguments set out by Respondent raise two main questions. The first question is
whether or not Tatneft is State-controlled. If this is answered in the affirmative, the second
question is whether as such it would nonetheless qualify as an investor under the Russia-
Ukraine BIT. As will be explained, the Tribunal is persuaded that the first issue should be
answered negatively, and thus there shall be no need for the Tribunal to examine the second

question.

128. The Tribunal shall to this end begin with an examination of what has come to be known as
a “structural test.” Both Parties appear to agree on the fact that from a strict legal point of
view Tatneft is a corporate entity separate from the Tatar Government, incorporated as a
joint stock company and endowed with its own corporate legal personality. This is also

quite evidently a matter of record which the Tribunal accepts as established.

129. The question then turns to an examination of whether in fact governmental control is in
place in respect of Tatneft. There is undoubtedly a government presence in Tatneft’s
governing bodies and some features of its operations. The fact that the Tatar Prime
Minister is the Chairman of the Board of Directors, that some other government officials
participate in it, and that Tatarstan owns a so-called “golden share” resulting in some veto

rights and administration privileges, points in that direction.

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 49 of 92

Those aspects of government presence, however, are not in themselves enough to reach a
conclusion on the issue before the Tribunal. It is also necessary for the Tribunal to note
that the Tatar Government’s shareholding is limited to 36% of the stock, that the
participation of Tatar Government officials in the Board does not constitute a majority of
its members, and that the “golden share” privileges have not been shown to have been
exercised in the conduct of Tatneft’s affairs, as explained by Claimant. The argument that
the Tatar Government’s shares are held by means of a wholly-owned government entity”
does not change the factual situation noted above; nor for that matter does the allegation
that the rest of the shares in Tatneft are owned by individuals or entities that could be
related to that Tatar Government. While the S&P Report points out that “obscure

241 this

intermediary vehicles are used for the control by regional authorities in Tatneft,
assertion, besides its rather general scope, does not appear to offer evidence on which the
Tribunal could rely to establish that government control in fact exists. Therefore, in the
absence of specific evidence in this respect there would be no justification to undertake the
piercing of Tatneft’s corporate veil nor would this appear to meet the strict legal conditions

normally required for such a piercing.

The transition of Tatneft from a State company to a commercial joint stock corporation has
followed a pattern which is rather typical of the former Soviet Republics that have
substituted market economy models for their past centrally-planned status. Privatization
has usually accompanied this transition, as is the case here. This transition is not unknown
to Western economies either, as noted by the Maffezini decision in the case of SODIGA in
Spain and by many other cases in which State-owned companies have been privatized. In
this context it is not unusual that the government will retain certain rights, particularly in

respect of the structure of the capital stock or charter amendments.

These surviving rights do not suggest, however, that the company keeps on being a State-
owned entity or that the transition in question is fictitious unless other expressions of
control are available, such as government ownership of a majority of the capital stock, as

was the case in Maffezini, Salini v. Morocco and others noted above in the context of

*40 Tatarstan holds approximately 36% of Tatneft voting stock through OAO Svyazinvestnetekhim, a company wholly-

owned by the Government of Tatarstan and one of its subsidiaries. See above, para. 102; Management and Discussion

Claimant’s argument. Significant control of management and operational decisions might
offer other indications of factual State ownership, but such control does not appear to be

present in this case.

In connection with the structural test, tribunals have also examined on occasions whether
the nature of the activity undertaken would be indicative of some form of exercise of
sovereign authority associated to the concept of jure imperii, as was the case in Jan de Nul
noted above. Claimant’s argument to the effect that investing in a downstream refinery to
process the oil produced in another country cannot be considered an activity de jure
imperii, or is in some other way attributable to the State, is persuasive. While in some
countries oil production and refining is done by private companies, in others it is done by
public entities, but even the latter will not normally be operating in the context of sovereign
powers. The Tribunal must accordingly conclude that the structural test for establishing

government control has not been met in the instant case.

The fact that Tatneft has not invoked sovereign immunity before the courts of Ukraine has
also been raised as an argument to justify that it is thus not a State-owned or controlled
entity. The Tribunal does not believe this argument to be dispositive of the issue since not
claiming immunity does not mean that it could not have been invoked as a matter of law if
the entity so claiming qualifies for this jurisdictional protection. The Tribunal must note,
however, that the distinction between jure imperii and jure gestionis was born in the
context of claims to sovereign immunity, so as to prevent jurisdiction in the first case and

allow for it in the second.

The Tribunal must proceed to examine next whether in spite of government control not
having been shown from a “structural” point of view, there might still be a case for finding
that the “functional test” is met. Respondent believes in this respect that in fact Tatneft is
used by the Tatar Government to pursue its public policies, expressed in terms of
employment goals, social undertakings, the supply of oil to preferred clients, budgetary

contributions and raising capital for public purposes, among other expressions.

Claimant itself has explained that some such purposes have been pursued in the context of
the company’s activities, but that these have been for the most part imposed by law on

every company incorporated in Tatarstan, or are policies that any major company might

Commentary on Article 5 of the Draft Articles on Responsi

Commission, 2001, vol. II(2), p. 26 at p. 48, para. 6, CLA:

 

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 51 of 92

pursue anywhere in the world in terms of social responsibility. It has also been noted that
financial transactions have taken the form of repayable loans and that in any event they are

one-time occurrences.

As with the structural test, the Tribunal is convinced that some such functional elements are
present in Tatneft’s policies, but they do not appear to amount to the core of its business
and are rather marginal. Because of its past close connection with the Tatar Government, it
is perhaps inevitable that some of these policy elements might have survived in Tatneft, but
again that does not mean that the company loses its essential commercial aims in the
undertaking of business. It would be quite different if business were undertaken on behalf
of the State for the accomplishment of its public objectives. In Claimant’s argument this
was not even the case under the Soviet Union because Tatneft was established as a

production unit of oil and gas and its refining.

The Tribunal is mindful that the Commentary on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility
concludes that not even the conduct of State-owned and controlled corporate entities is
attributable to the State unless involving the exercise of governmental authority." While
questions of attribution belong to the merits of the case, Respondent has invoked such
tules, with particular reference to Articles 5 and 8 of the International Law Commission’s
Articles on State Responsibility, to find guidance by analogy as to whether for
jurisdictional purposes Tatneft’s conduct should be attributable to Tatarstan,”"? which in
Respondent’s view is the case here, including the attribution of Tatneft’s shareholding in

Ukrtatnafta.

The Tribunal cannot fail to note, however, that Respondent’s argument stresses that
Ukraine cannot be held responsible for court decisions, such as those concerning Mr.
Ovcharenko and their consequences, because of considerations of proximity and

foreseeability, an argument that does not seem to follow its views on attribution.”

140. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Tatneft has been empowered to exercise governmental
authority in light of the facts of this case, despite that its participation finds its origins in the
Ukrtatnafta Treaty and other governmental measures adopted for its negotiation and
materialization. It should also be noted that even though the Tatar President resolved in his
Decree of 1994 to approve the transfer of various shares and rights to the authorized fund
of Ukrtatnafta, the Decree refers to those shares held by the Republic of Tatarstan and
State-owned assets, which insofar as Tatneft was concerned were at the time undergoing
privatization.”“° The effects on the question of parity of this and other decisions concerning
the Tatar contribution is a separate matter that shall be discussed further below.” As will
also be discussed below, business decisions characterize Tatneft’s activities and the
company is subject to legislation on competition, taxation and other aspects that are typical
of private entities, just like the nature of such activities is in essence unrelated to the

exercise of governmental authority.

141.

The Parties have argued extensively about the filings of Tatneft before the SEC and
whether these again show that the company is under government dependency and
ultimately an instrumentality of the Tatar Government. In that filing Tatneft indeed
asserted that “the Tatarstan government is able to exercise considerable influence over us.
The Tatarstan government has used its influence in the past to mandate oil sales and to
cause us to raise capital for the benefit of Tatarstan or to pay the debts of Tatarstan when

independently we may not have entered into such transactions.”™"*

142. Claimant has explained that such filings must refer to all possible risks in order to avoid
potential liability if some form of government interference results in the underperformance
of the instruments offered. The Tribunal notes that the filing in question, which was made
in 2006, refers to instances of “past” influence, which may well have been the case at a
certain point in time.*” That does not mean, however, that it is necessarily so at present.
The providing of information about risk is the very purpose of such filings and because, in
the context of operating in a former Soviet Republic, government influence or intervention
cannot be excluded as an absolute certainty at some future juncture, a precautionary risk

disclosure might be justified but does not alter the commercial elements involved in a

company of this kind.

The Tribunal also notes the Parties’ discussion on whether there are “political elements” to
this dispute that could affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal, however, is satisfied
that no such argument has been made by Respondent but that Respondent only asserts that
the likely Russian pressure against Ukraine reveals that the dispute is typically inter-
governmental.”*°
The Parties have also discussed whether Tatneft’s participation in the Ukrtatnafta project is
merely as an agent for the Tatarstan Republic or as a fully independent commercial
company. The question of a fiduciary arrangement or powers of attorney mentioned above

has been at the heart of this discussion.”*!

The Tribunal believes that there is nothing unusual in that both the interests of the Tatar
Government and one major oil company incorporated in that Republic might coincide in a
foreign business project, or that practical questions might justify the convenience of

granting powers of attorney for a period of time.

Furthermore, the fact that the Ukrtatnafta project was established and organized under a
treaty does not show that all forms of participation might be tainted by government
dependency. Many projects set under international agreements facilitate the business
operations of both public and private entities, particularly where trans-border questions

arise.

The Tribunal is also mindful that, as held in CSOB, not even the pursuit of public policies
can always be equated with the loss of the commercial nature of the specific activity
undertaken, be it banking as in that case or oil processing as in this one. The CSOB

tribunal held that “the steps taken by CSOB to solidify its financial position in order to

attract private capital for its restructured banking enterprise do not differ in their nature

from measures a private bank might take to strengthen its financial position.”?

The question this Tribunal must answer is thus whether in this case the kind of measures
taken by Tatneft in the pursuit of its business might differ in their nature from measures any
other major oil company may take. The facts underlying the functional test in this case do
not lead in the direction of finding that Tatneft is an instrumentality of the Tatar

Government but rather a private entity with government links surviving former times.

The Tribunal fully understands Respondent’s views that tend to identify those elements of
governmental presence that could disqualify Tatneft from claiming under the Russia-
Ukraine BIT. Indeed, according to Respondent, the Ukrtatnafta project is a government-to-
government project in which Tatneft has not participated in commercial terms?
Claimant’s argument stresses those elements that are typical of private commercial
ventures. While a company like Tatneft, originating in past models, shows a certain

interaction of both elements, the Tribunal must find which of the two predominates.

In light of the Tribunal’s findings about Tatneft not meeting the structural or the functional
test for establishing de jure or de facto government control, or for establishing that it carries
out government functions, the Tribunal must conclude that business-related aspects
predominate in Tatneft’s operations and that it is thus entitled to claim as a private investor
under the Russia-Ukraine BIT. The record of profits obtained by Tatneft between 2005 and
2008, which Claimant explained at the hearing,” is not insignificant and confirms the

predominant business orientation of the company.

Even if it were held that Tatneft is a public company in light of its origins and some of its

features, it is not unusual to have such companies claiming as investors in investment

arbitration. Claimant has invoked in this connection the cases of AGIP, EDF, Saipem,

CSOB, Telenor and other companies.”

152. In light of the Tribunal’s conclusion reached above that Tatneft is entitled to claim as a
private investor, the Tribunal need not address the issue of whether public entities are
allowed to claim under the Russia-Ukraine BIT or under Russian or Ukrainian investment
laws. The Tribunal’s conclusion regarding Tatneft’s private investor status does not
prejudge this important issue, which has been prominently and competently discussed by

the Parties in their pleadings.

3. Third Objection to Jurisdiction: Tatneft’s Participation in Ukrtatnafta Is Not an
Investment_within the Meaning of the Russia-Ukraine BIT (Objection Ratione
Materiae)

Respondent's arguments

153. Respondent submits a third objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in terms that, even if it
were admitted that the Russia-Ukraine BIT applies to this dispute and that Tatneft is an
investor under its terms, the Tribunal still cannot exercise jurisdiction over this claim as
Claimant’s participation in Ukrtatnafta is not an “investment” according to the definition of

investments provided in Article 1(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.

154. In Respondent’s view, Ukrtatnafta was described by the Ukrtatnafta Treaty as “an
integrated interstate economic complex of Ukraine and the Republic of Tatarstan” (Article

3) with the principal purpose of securing the oil supply to the Contracting Parties (Article

256 Article 1(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides that

“Investments” shall denote all kinds of property and intellectual values, which are put in by the investor of one
Contracting Party on the territory of the other Contracting Party in conformity with the latter’s legislation, and in
particular:

a) movable and immovable property and any other rights of property therein;

A participation

situation does not correspond to an investment decision by the investor; unlike the investor
in Tokios Tokelés, Tatneft has not caused an investment in Ukrtatnafta by means of the

Claimant’s arguments

In Claimant’s view, Tatneft’s participation in Ukrtatnafta complies with all the
requirements and conditions that the Russia-Ukraine BIT envisages in its definition of
investments, particularly in terms of encompassing all kinds of property and intellectual
values, including monetary funds and securities and the right to perform commercial

activity, as well as prospecting, development and exploitation of natural resources, among

others. At no point does this definition exclude the protection of investments that, like

here, have been made for a mixed public and commercial purpose.?™

Claimant further argues that arbitral tribunals have consistently rejected the pretension of
introducing additional requirements in the definitions of investment included in the
applicable bilateral investment treaties. This was in particular the case of Tokios Tokelés,
where Ukraine attempted to introduce an origin-of-capital requirement. So too in Saluka
the tribunal refused to take into consideration the motives of the investor’s decision to

invest as nothing in the bilateral investment treaty allowed it to do 80.765

Claimant also asserts that in this case the combination of mixed commercial and public
motives are predominant features of the investment undertaken, as confirmed by the
Ukrtatnafta Charter (Article 2.1) and the 1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement, which
the Russia-Ukraine BIT sought to develop.” Claimant points to Article 3 of the 1993
Investment Cooperation Agreement which defines the “Parties’ investments” as “types of
property, financial, intellectual valuables invested by Parties’ investors into objects of
entrepreneurial activity and other types of activity for the purpose of gaining profit
(income) or a social effect.””°” It is noted that profit and social effects reflect that very
purpose of a mixed commercial and public nature related to investments under these

oe 2
provisions.”

The Tribunal’s findings

The Tribunal must begin its considerations in this matter by examining the definition of
“investments” in Article 1(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. Like with many bilateral
investment treaties, the definition is indeed broad and intends to cover all activities that
might be related to the economic interest of the investor in undertaking such investment.
The definition refers to “all kinds of property and intellectual values” invested in the

territory of another “Contracting Party,” identifying in particular “movable and immovable

property and any other rights of property therein, [...] monetary funds and also securities,
liabilities, deposits and other forms of participation” and “rights to perform commercial
activity, including rights to prospecting, development and exploitation of natural

resources.”°?

 

160. The Tribunal would have great difficulty in concluding that Tatneft’s participation in
Ukrtatnafta does not qualify as an investment in light of the definition noted. In fact it
qualifies as an investment under almost all the kinds of property listed therein. Tatneft’s
contribution may have been amended to separate it from the obligation to supply oil
produced in certain deposits and assign to such contribution a monetary value, but far from
disqualifying the investment made, it comes to confirm that the activity was conceived as

encompassing various kinds of assets of economic value.

161.

The Tribunal rejects entering into an examination of the motives behind the investment,
unless there were evidences of bad faith, abuse of the law or improper behavior, which is
not the case here. Although allegations of a set-up have been made in connection with the
share purchases by Amruz and Seagroup, there is no evidence of this on record and the
allegation has been denied.?” This Tribunal agrees with the decision in Saluka, noted
above, which refused to take into account the investor’s motives. Indeed, rather than
examining the motives behind the investment, this Tribunal must seek to establish, in
accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the
ordinary meaning of the terms of the Russia-Ukraine BIT in their context and in light of its
object and purpose, and whether Claimant’s alleged investment falls within the meaning of
those terms. The Tribunal notes, further, that it is a generally accepted view that no
additional conditions to those agreed by the parties should be introduced by tribunals in the
definition of investments. As long as the activities undertaken meet the elements of the

definition noted, which is the case here, they should be considered as a covered investment.

162. The Parties have again argued in this context whether the investment relates to public or
business purposes, or a combination thereof. The Tribunal finds Claimant’s argument that
mixed purposes characterize its investment to be persuasive. In fact, such purpose is not

only in accordance with the legal texts governing the Ukrtatnafta project noted but also

reflects the realities described above about the interaction of both public and private
interests that has been typical of the transition period between the command economies of

the past and the market economies of the present.

163. It is also relevant to note in this respect that in CSOB the tribunal held that a State-owned

would that be the case when the enterprise has accomplished its transition to privatization
and competition but still relies on certain government policies to that effect. Unlike
Maffezini, however, in this case the private entity is operating for profit and is not
discharging what could be considered as essentially governmental functions delegated to it

by the State.”

164. These mixed purposes do not alter the fact that the interest and activity of Tatneft in the
Ukrtatnafta project are, in their essence, commercially-orientated. The Tribunal must also
note that the very definition of investments in the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides that “[nJo
alteration of the type of investments, which the funds are put in, shall affect their nature as

investments [.. 2°73 Whether the contribution made took one form or another is irrelevant

 

as it was conceived in either case as a type of investment in the Ukrtatnafta fund, and thus
its nature as an investment does not change. The Tribunal thus concludes that Tatneft has

made an investment within the meaning of the BIT.

4. Fourth Objection to Jurisdiction: Tatneft’s Participation in Ukrtatnafta Is Not in
Conformity with Ukrainian Legislation (Objection Ratione Materiae)

Respondent's arguments

165. In close connection with the objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction examined above,
Respondent asserts that even if Tatneft’s shareholding in Ukrtatnafta were to be qualified as

a private investment, it still would not qualify for protection under the Russia-Ukraine BIT

because it was not made in conformity with the legislation of the State where the
24

investment was made, as required under Article 1(1) and reiterated under Article 2(1).
166. Respondent asserts that the requirement of conformity with the host State’s legislation is
not limited to the initiation of the investment, as Claimant contends,””> but is a continuing
requirement such that protections under the Russia-Ukraine BIT should only be extended
insofar as the investment is at all relevant times in compliance with the law.’° Unlike the

sos 21
relevant provision in Fraport,

the language used in Article 1(1) of the Russia-Ukraine
BIT is not tied to the admission of the investment itself, and thus Fraport should not be
relied upon to limit the requirement of complying with the host State’s legislation.””* In
any event, Respondent argues that Tatneft’s investment was not originally made in
compliance with Ukrainian law, and Tatneft also did not abide by the continuing

requirement of parity in the Ukrtatnafta Treaty?”

167. In Respondent’s view, breach of Ukrainian legislation is found at the very origin of
Tatneft’s investment. While Ukrtatnafta was registered in December 1995 with Tatneft
listed as a founding shareholder holding 20.01% of shares, Tatneft did not make any
contribution to Ukrtatnafta until 14 August 2000, when it paid US$ 1 million in cash, with
its shareholding reduced to 0.278%." This was followed by its acquisition of shares in
Ukrtatnafta held by Zenit Bank, a Russian commercial bank Tatneft had co-founded,
valued at US$ 30 million, although the purchase price paid by Tatneft to Zenit has not been

revealed.”*! This operation brought Tatneft’s shareholding in Ukrtatnafta to 8.613%.

1(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT as “all kinds of property and intellectual values, which are put in by the investor of one
Contracting Party on the territory of the other Contracting Party in conformity with the latter’s legislation.” Article 2(1)
of the Russia-Ukraine BIT similarly provides that “Each Contracting Party shall encourage the investors of the other
Contracting Party to make investments on its territory and shall allow such investments in so far as it is in conformity
with its respective legislation.” See Exhibit R-2.

Thus, from Ukrtatnafta’s incorporation in December 1995 until August 2000, Tatneft
appeared and acted as a shareholder in Ukrtatnafta without making any contribution to the

company, which violated the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement and Ukrainian
3

legislation.”* Respondent emphasizes that in light of these facts, it should be recognized

that Tatneft’s investment was made in August 2000, and not December 1995 upon

Ukrtatnafta’s incorporation, as Claimant contends.?**

168. Respondent relies on the 1995 Incorporation Agreement, which provided that Tatneft’s
contribution in the form of fixed assets was to be made “no later than 30 days” from the

date of registration of the company.*>

While Tatarstan’s failure to contribute oil deposits
prevented Tatneft from contributing the fixed assets used to extract oil from such deposits,
even the amended contribution of US$ 1 million that was due on or before 10 September
1998 pursuant to the 1998 Amended Incorporation Agreement was not paid until August
2000.78° Despite Tatneft’s failure to make its contribution, Tatneft was not excluded from
Ukrtatnafta’s shareholding and in fact voted its shares at annual general shareholders’

meetings in violation of Ukrainian law.257

169. Pursuant to Article 33 of the Law on Business Entities, Tatneft was required to contribute
the full value of its shares “not later than one year after’ the company’s registration.”**
Pursuant to Article 8 of the Law on Securities and Stock Exchange, no shares could be

issued to Tatneft prior to its actual contribution in August 2000.78? Finally, pursuant to

Article 41(2) of the Law on Business Entities, Tatneft had no right to participate in any
meetings of shareholders before its contribution in August 2000.7°° Respondent maintains
that both Tatneft and Tatarstan must have been aware of the irregularity of their
shareholder status as they participated in the general shareholders’ meetings in 1997 and
1998, and voted for the exclusion of other shareholders that had not yet contributed their
share capital.?! Because of these non-conformities with host State legislation, Tatneft’s

investment falls outside the scope of the Russia-Ukraine BIT’s protections.

Tatneft’s investment was also not made in conformity with Ukrainian law because it was
made in conjunction with and in support of Tatneft’s attempt to subvert the parity
requirement established in the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and other constituent documents of

Ukrtatnafta through the acquisition of majority control of the company.”

The maintenance of parity between the Tatar and Ukrainian sides was an essential
requirement of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, not just at the origin, as Claimant contends, but
throughout the life of the project.?”? Respondent relies on the language of the Ukrtatnafta

7294 and notes

Treaty which provided for the incorporation of Ukrtatnafta “on a parity basis,
the Tatar presidential decree of 13 December 1994 and the minutes of the 1994 meeting
between Ukrainian and Tatar governmental officials, each of which reference parity
between Tatar and Ukrainian sides in relation to the Ukrtatnafta project.” The 1995
Incorporation Agreement and the original Ukrtatnafta Charter even refer to the preservation
of parity in the event of modification of the Ukrtatnafta fund." Respondent argues that it

is evident in Tatneft’s own Statement of Claim that it breached the parity of the Ukrtatnafta

project when it became allied in interest with Tatarstan, Amruz and Seagroup to leverage a

controlling position of 55.7% in the company.”””

Respondent contends that the introduction of Amruz in 1998 and Seagroup in 1999 to the
shareholding of Ukrtatnafta violated the Ukrtatnafta Treaty because it “was designed
covertly to alter the equilibrium between the parties” agreed in the documents noted
above.”* Evidence of this lies in the fact that Amruz and Seagroup paid with promissory
notes, thus not contributing to the company’s working capital needs, and still obtained the

valuable position of power broker between the Ukrainian and Tatar parties.”

Although Claimant has argued that the State Property Fund of Ukraine supported the 1998

Amended Incorporation Agreement*”°

that changed the parity requirement, and therefore
Respondent is estopped from arguing the agreement’s illegality” Respondent retorts that
no decision of a shareholders’ meeting could alter the requirements of the Ukrtatnafta
Treaty, and therefore such decisions are ineffective.*” Moreover, the actions taken at the
1998 shareholders’ meeting, including the decision to amend the 1995 Incorporation
Agreement and Ukrtatnafta Charter and alter parity, are ineffective because a valid quorum
of 60% of the shareholders was not present at the meeting. This is because both Tatneft

and Tatarstan had no legal right to attend and vote shares they had not legally acquired.°°

Claimant’s arguments

In Claimant’s view, Respondent’s late argument that the 1998 amendments to the
Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement are invalid because Tatneft had not made its
contribution within the prescribed time, and was hence not entitled to have shares issued in
its name or vote in shareholders’ meetings until full payment had been received, is

contradicted by the facts of the case.

175. While the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was clear that from the outset Ukraine would contribute the
Kremenchug Refinery to the Ukrtatnafta project, the assets to be contributed by Tatneft and
Tatarstan were not identified with equal specificity and the question became subject to
intense negotiations between the Parties. When the original envisaged contribution of
certain Tatarstan oil fields and oil-related assets proved to be unfeasible in economic terms,

Ukrtatnafta shareholders sought other alternatives.*”

Following a reappraisal of the
Kremenchug Refinery and a reduction of its capital value, it was agreed in 1999 that

Tatarstan would transfer shares of its oil company Tatneftprom to Ukrtatnafta.*°

176. It was also agreed that Claimant would contribute US$ 31 million in cash to Ukrtatnafta

 

instead of oil-related assets.*”’ In view of the need to obtain authorization from Russia’s
Central Bank to make a cash contribution, Tatneft’s contribution was made in the form of
US$ 1 million transfer in its own name and US$ 30 million share purchases by Zenit Bank,
acting as Tatneft’s trustee and becoming a temporary shareholder in Ukrtatnafta.°
Following the authorization of the Russian Central Bank in 2000, Zenit’s shares in
Ukrtatnafta were later repurchased by Tatneft.°” Claimant also submits that its expertise
and technical knowledge in the oil sector were also crucial to Ukrtatnafta’s viability and as

such are also a kind of investment protected under the Russia-Ukraine BIT?”

177. Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s interpretation of Article 33 of the Ukrainian Law on

Business entities. Claimant asserts that Article 33 sets out the legal consequences when

311

there is a violation of the law. A shareholder shall pay 10% per annum of the amount

overdue, a penalty that was never invoked; and the company may dispose of the

outstanding shares, which Ukrtatnafta did not do? Additionally, the contractual

obligation of the founders of Ukrtatnafta to make their contributions within thirty days
under the 1995 Incorporation Agreement does not qualify as “legislation” within the

meaning of Article 1(1) of the Russia-Ukraine Bit.

178. Claimant asserts, moreover, that Tatneft and Tatarstan have at all times prior to these
proceedings, and even months after they were commenced, been recognized by Respondent
as legitimate shareholders in Ukrtatnafta.** Ukraine never sought to exclude Tatneft or
Tatarstan from shareholders’ meetings or question their right to vote despite the

complications in the formation of the capital of Ukrtatnafta.*!5

Only in its Reply did
Ukraine take the position for the first time that the 1998 shareholders’ meeting was illegal
and ineffective due to the alleged lack of prescribed 60% quorum of shareholders.*'®
Moreover, in certain Ukrainian court proceedings, the Ukrainian Government took the
position that the shareholders’ resolutions and amended agreements were in general lawful
and lack of payment of the contributions within the given deadline constituted, if anything,
a curable breach.*!” Finally, the lack of quorum argument could no longer be invoked, as

the applicable statute of limitations is long expired.*!®

179. Claimant also disagrees with Respondent's interpretation of the meaning of “parity” in the
Ukrtatnafta Treaty and related documents. Claimant first argues that the stipulation to

incorporate Ukrtatnafta “on a parity basis” did not amount to a requirement but was rather a

319

description of the initial distribution of the share capital of Ukrtatnafta. Even if the

language of parity was mandatory and not descriptive, the requirement had a temporal

limitation and only applied to the initial distribution of the capital shares at the time of

incorporation, and Ukrtatnafta was not intended to remain incorporated on a parity basis in

perpetuity.”

180. If the parity issue had been so essential to Ukrainian law it would have been spelled out in
specific mandatory terms in the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and subsequent instruments governing

the Ukrtatnafta project, but this was not generally the case.*7!

The only reference to the
applicability of the parity principle to modification of the shareholding structure was
contained in the 1995 version of the Incorporation Agreement; however, this was freely

amendable and in fact amended to delete this language in 1998.3?

The lack of a continuing
parity requirement is further confirmed by the fact that shareholders from the start intended

Ukrtatnafta to be transformed into an open joint stock company .*?*

181. Considering that following the expropriation events alleged by Claimant Ukrainian
shareholders now control over 60% of Ukrtatnafta’s shares, Claimant argues that Ukraine

itself would be in breach of a continuing parity requirement, if one exists.>4

182. In Claimant’s interpretation according to the express language in Article 1(1) of the Russia-
Ukraine BIT and the ruling in Fraport, the requirement to make an investment in

accordance with the host State’s legislation is limited to the initiation of the investment and

5

does not extend to post-investment violations. — Claimant explains that the share

distribution in 1995 was indisputably made on a parity basis.*”°

183. Moreover, before the share purchases of Amruz and Seagroup intervened resulting in
Respondent’s view in the violation of parity, references to such parity were abandoned by

amendments made to the constituent documents of Ukrtatnafta, including the 1995

Incorporation Agreement and Ukrtatnafta Charter.*?” Thus, Amruz’s and Seagroup’s

investments were made at a time when parity was no longer envisioned.*”*

184. Finally, none of Claimant’s actions amount to a breach of a fundamental principle of the
host State’s laws, according to the qualification of this requirement in L.E.S.1., or to
misrepresentation, as was the case in Plama, or to an intent to acquire jurisdiction by some

fictitious and abusive acquisition, as was the case in Phoenix”?

185. In any event, Claimant asserts, Respondent should be estopped from relying on alleged
violations of Ukrainian law as a bar to jurisdiction and admissibility. Ukraine did not
protest any of the events it now protests until a decade after the events occurred, despite the
fact that Ukrainian officials sat on the management and supervisory boards of the
company.**° All of the 1998 amendments to the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement were
unanimously approved by Ukrtatnafta shareholders, including the State Property Fund of
Ukraine.**! Ukraine never protested the participation of Tatneft or Tatarstan in general
meetings of shareholders, and it never claimed a violation of Article 33 of the Law on
Business Entities or Article 8 of the Law on Securities and Stock Exchange; moreover, it
expressly consented to the admission of Amruz and Seagroup into the Ukrtatnafta
shareholding, and the deletion of references to parity in the company’s founding

documents.**

hold a government estopped from invoking as a jurisdictional defense a violation of its

Respondent is estopped from arguing that an agreement which it has approved was not
initially valid.*** Moreover, considering that Ukrainian shareholders now control over 60%
of Ukrtatnafta’s shares, Respondent also should not be heard to allege an illegality where it

is itself in breach.***

The Tribunal’s findings

In connection with this objection to jurisdiction the Tribunal must address whether or not
Claimant’s investment was made in compliance with Ukrainian legislation, as required by

Articles 1(1) and 2(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.

Respondent has alleged breaches of the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement, Ukrainian
Law on Business Entities and Ukrainian Law on Securities and Stock Exchange arising
from the circumstances of Claimant’s contribution to Ukrtatnafta in exchange for its
shareholding. As will be explained, the Tribunal is persuaded that Claimant’s non-
compliance with the time limits imposed on its contribution does not deprive the
investment of protection under the Russia-Ukraine BIT. Once the participation in the form
of contributing the development of certain Tatarstan oil fields and oil-related assets did not
prove feasible, an alternative arrangement was agreed upon, including the commitment of
Tatarstan to contribute shares in Tatneftprom and of Tatneft to pay US$ 31 million for the
shares issued.**° True enough, this last payment was done late and through an intricate
financial arrangement involving Zenit Bank,*” but there is no evidence that the late capital

contribution caused Tatneft’s investment to be illegal.

While the thirty-day period imposed by the 1995 Incorporation Agreement was not
complied with, this was only upon the realization that the intended contribution of fixed
assets was unfeasible, and this does not amount to a breach of legislation. Moreover, under
Article 33 of the Ukrainian Law on Business Entities, if shares are not paid within three

months after expiration of the prescribed term (of not more than one year), the company

may dispose of such shares, but this is not mandatory and in this case Ukrtatnafta did
not.8 Despite the tardiness of its contribution, Tatneft was recognized as a Ukrtatnafta
shareholder and exercised voting rights without any objections by Ukrainian shareholders,

and therefore the pertinent contributions cannot be considered to be tainted by illegality.

190. The Tribunal is also mindful of the provision in Article 1(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT to
the effect that “[n]Jo alteration of the type of investments, which the funds are put in, shall
affect their nature as investments, unless such alteration is contrary to the laws of the
Contracting Party on whose territory the investments were made.” In the absence of a
specific law of Ukraine that would have been breached as a result of implementing a
different form of participation, the changes in that participation, which transformed it into a
different kind of economic arrangement pursuing the same ends, do not affect the

protections afforded to the investment under the BIT.

191.

In light of the Tribunal’s conclusion that Claimant’s late contribution does not render its
shareholding invalid, Respondent’s objection based on Article 41 of the Law on Business
Entities is also without merit. Article 41 establishes that the right to participate in general
meetings of shareholders is vested in persons holding shares at the date of the general
meeting, and quorum for a valid meeting requires the attendance of shareholders holding
over 60% of the votes.*” While Respondent has argued that all actions taken at the 1997
and 1998 shareholders’ meetings are invalid due to a lack of quorum, Claimant has
persuasively argued that it would be incorrect to count Tatneft’s shares for purposes of
counting total outstanding shares, but not to count them for purposes of constituting
quorum. Even if Tatneft’s shares were invalid, Respondent has not alleged that quorum
would not have been met at these meetings without counting Tatneft’s shares as part of the
total outstanding shares. Thus it does not appear that these meetings were tainted by
illegality.

538 Article 33 of the Ukrainian Law on Business Entities, Exhibit R-78, provides: “Within the terms prescribed by the
constituent meeting, but not later than one year after registration of a joint stock company, the shareholder shall pay up
the full value of the shares. Upon failure to pay up within the prescribed term the shareholder shall pay for the period of
delay 10 per cent per annum of the amount of the overdue payment, unless otherwise provided by the company’s

charter. When the failure to pay up is pending for 3 months after the pres scribed term for payment, the joint stock
company may dispose of such shares as prescribed by the company’s charter. [...

 

5 Article 41 of the Ukrainian Law on Business Entities, Exhibit R-23, provides in relevant parts: (para. 2) “The right to
participate in a general meeting of shareholders shall be vested in the persons holding shares as on the date of the
general meeting (other than the constituent meeting)”; (para. 8) “The General Meeting shall be acknowledged as valid if
attended by Shareholders holding, under the company Charter, over 60 percent of the votes.”

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 70 of 92

Moreover, as explained above, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Tatneft’s late contribution
does not make its shareholding invalid, and this is further evidenced by the fact that
Ukrainian parties never objected to its presence or participation at these shareholder
meetings. It is also noteworthy that any objection based on breach of either the Ukrainian
Law on Business Entities or the Ukrainian Law on Securities and Stock Exchange is

inapposite due to the expiry of the applicable three year limitations period.”

Respondent has also alleged that Tatneft’s investment was not made in conformity with
Ukrainian legislation because it was made in support of its attempt to subvert the parity
between Ukrainian and Tatar sides, a requirement entrenched in governing documents of
the Ukrtatnafta project. There is no doubt that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty provided for the
incorporation of Ukrtatnafta “on a parity basis,”**! but the Parties have divergent opinions
on the implications of this provision. The Tribunal must thus determine whether parity was
a) merely descriptive of the initial distribution of shares, b) a requirement applicable only at
the stage of incorporation, or c) a requirement that was applicable to the entire life of the

Ukrtatnafta project.

It is reasonable to assume that the stipulation in the Ukrtatnafta Treaty to incorporate
Ukrtatnafta “on a parity basis” was mandatory and required that Tatarstan’s and Ukraine’s
participation be on equal footing at the outset of the company’s incorporation. This
objective was well-reflected in the parity of the initial contributions envisaged, and was in

fact complied with in terms of the initial distribution of capital shares.

It is relevant that, unlike the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, the Ukrtatnafta Charter and 1995
Incorporation Agreement each stipulated that parity would be preserved in the event of
alteration of the Ukrtatnafta fund. These documents could be amended by shareholder
agreement and were in fact amended in 1998 to remove the mandatory language of
preserving parity. The fact that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, which could not be freely amended
by shareholders, did not contain similar language, indicates that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty did

not impose a continuing parity requirement on the Ukrtatnafta project. It would have been

Meeting between the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan on the Establishment of
Transnational Finance and Production Petroleum company “UKRTATNAFTA”, Exhibit R-15, also give evidence that
Ukrtatnafta was incorporated on a parity basis.

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 71 of 92

different if the Ukrtatnafta Treaty had mandated that the share distribution would have to
be preserved on an equal basis at all times, but this was not the case. Thus, while the
Ukrtatnafta Charter and 1995 Incorporation Agreement did provide for the preservation of
parity, these documents were validly amended by unanimous vote of shareholders 1998, at

the same time that Amruz was introduced to Ukrtatnafta’s shareholding structure.

The fact that Amruz and Seagroup were accepted as new shareholders is also indicative that
the parity basis had a flexibility inherent to the financial or operational needs of
Ukrtatnafta, and if the Tatar Government, Tatneft and these new shareholders achieved
some form of shareholder alliance resulting in the control of 55.7% of the stock, this cannot
be held contrary to Ukrainian legislation but is rather the expression of normal majorities in
a joint stock company and its voting arrangements. Claimant’s argument that Ukraine itself
now controls 60% of Ukrtatnafta shares which would, following Respondent’s views, also
be in breach of parity, is persuasive and shows that parity was not understood as a

continuing requirement under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.

The Tribunal is also of the opinion that the language of Articles 1(1) and 2(1) of the Russia-
Ukraine BIT indicates that Claimant’s investment should be in conformity with the host
State’s legislation at its initiation, but does not convey the meaning that this would have to

be a permanent requirement. Indeed, Article 2(1) establishes that Ukraine “shall allow?

or “shall admit’*?

investments in accordance with its legislation, which points to the
initiation of the investment. The discussion in Fraport that “the effective operation of the
BIT regime would appear to require that jurisdictional compliance be limited to the

initiation of the investment”**

is illustrative of the question that in certain instances that
might be the appropriate conclusion unless clear evidence to the contrary is available. This

evidence is not available in this instant case.

As noted above, it is undisputed that Ukrtatnafta was in fact incorporated on a parity basis
in 1995. It is noteworthy, however, that Claimant’s investment also complied with host

State law in 2000 when its amended capital contribution was actually transferred to

Ukrtatnafta, firstly because the parity requirement under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty only
applied to incorporation, and secondly because the continuing parity requirement under the
Ukrtatnafta Charter and 1995 Incorporation Agreement had been removed by unanimous
shareholder vote in 1998. Thus, at the initiation of the investment, Tatneft complied with
the parity noted in the Ukrtatnafta Treaty; and in 2000, it complied with the new structure

of capital contributions unanimously agreed at the shareholders meetings in 1998 and 1999.

199. In light of the Tribunal’s above findings, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to decide

whether Respondent should be estopped from invoking this jurisdictional defense, as
Claimant contends. True enough, the record shows the State Property Fund of Ukraine
supported the 1998 Amended Incorporation Agreement, including the alterations noted in
respect of the parity of the project, just as a number of Ukrainian Government officials
participating in the pertinent meetings did, particularly in their capacity as members of
Ukrtatnafta’s supervisory board.**° These facts provide further evidence that for the
Ukrainian shareholders the new kinds of arrangements which altered the parity of the

project were satisfactory and were not understood to be in breach of Ukrainian legislation.

200. In any case, it has not been shown that any supposed breach concerned a fundamental

201.

Min

principle of the host State’s legislation as required by the L.E.S.1. case.*"° Finally, there are
no indications on record to the effect that Claimant engaged in abusive conduct in breach of
the host State’s legislation or otherwise acted in bad faith. For the reasons stated above,
therefore, Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on this count cannot be

upheld.

OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY

As explained above at paragraph 77 of this award, Respondent has also submitted three
objections concerning the admissibility of Tatneft’s claims. The first objection is based on
the understanding that Claimant cannot claim for the interests of Amruz and Seagroup; the
second objection concerns the allegation that Claimant has no ius standi to claim for unpaid

oil deliveries; and the third objection is that Tatneft has failed to state an arguable case

utes of Ukrtatnafta’s General Meeting No. 3 of 10 June 1998, Exhibit C-131.

67

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 73 of 92

concerning the alleged harm to its rights as a shareholder. This last claim was, however,
partially withdrawn at the opening of the Jurisdictional Hearing.” The pertinent

objections will be examined next.

1. First Objection to Admissibility: Tatneft Has No Jus Standi to Claim on behalf of
Amruz and Seagroup

Respondent’s arguments

202. In Respondent’s view, it is unclear what legal theory Claimant relies upon as the basis of its
additional US$ 1.3 billion claim** in relation to Amruz and Seagroup.*” In fact, according
to Respondent, there is no legal theory that may support Tatneft’s claim: if Tatneft is
bringing a claim for loss of the “enhanced value” of its own shareholding based on the
existence of a shareholders’ alliance, “such a claim is manifestly without merit”;>? if

Tatneft is bringing a claim for indirect loss as a shareholder in Seagroup and Amruz due to

the latter’s loss of their own shares in Ukrtatnafta, Tatneft has no standing to claim on

351

behalf of Amruz and Seagroup. Indeed, even if the rights of Seagroup and Amruz had

been harmed, these companies are not parties to the arbitration and have separately
submitted “cooling-off letters” to Ukraine, respectively invoking the Energy Charter Treaty
and the Ukraine-USA BIT, just as Tatarstan has also submitted such a letter in connection

with the Russia-Ukraine BIT.**

203. Respondent further contends that Claimant can only claim for a loss relating to an

investment if it acquired the investment prior to the time its cause of action arose, which it

did not in this case.***

Respondent refers to several judicial proceedings, the first of which
was initiated in 2001, regarding the invalidation of the agreements for the purchase of
Ukrtatnafta shares by Amruz and Seagroup.* In particular, Respondent insists that while
Claimant acquired shares in Amruz and Seagroup in December 2007, Ukrainian courts
twice held earlier that year that the share purchase agreements were invalid and ordered the
transfer of Amruz’s and Seagroup’s shares to a third party (Naftogaz in May 2007 and the

Ministry of Fuel and Energy of Ukraine in December 2007).*°°

Respondent thus concludes
that the acquisition of the shares took place after the alleged harm had occurred, as
confirmed by Claimant’s own statements.*°° Because “the wrongful act had occurred on
the claimant’s own case before that acquisition in December 2007,” there was no composite
act, contrary to Claimant’s argument at the hearing.**” What happened after the alleged
deprivation of Amruz’s and Seagroup’s shares in 2007 “was the continuation of the

same.358

In addition, the sole purpose of Tatneft’s belated acquisition of shares in Amruz and
Seagroup was to sue Respondent in this particular forum.* At a time when Amruz’s and
Seagroup’s shares had been taken away and the refinery of which they were shareholders
had been raided, according to Claimant, by Mr Ovcharenko, there was no rational, let alone
commercial, justification for this acquisition It follows that Tatneft’s attempt to transfer
their alleged injury to itself by acquiring shares in these two companies amounts to

impermissible forum shopping.**!

Finally, Respondent contends that the purchase by these companies of founding shares was

contrary to the original understanding that shareholders would be limited to entities of

Tatarstan and Ukraine.*? Respondent also notes that the payment of founding shares with
promissory notes, as these companies did, is contrary to Ukrainian legislation. While it
is unnecessary, in Respondent’s view, to resolve these issues because Tatneft’s claims are

inadmissible, these “oddities” further undermine the legitimacy of these claims.**

To conclude, Respondent asks the Tribunal to find that “Ukraine has not consented to
arbitrate the claims of Swiss or American entities under the Ukraine-Russia BIT, that
Tatneft did not own shares in Seagroup and AmRuz at the time that these entities’ claims of
expropriation arose, and that therefore those claims do not have the requisite nationality
requirement to be brought under the Russia-Ukraine BIT [...] its claims in relation to
AmRuz and Seagroup should be deemed inadmissible and outside the scope of the

jurisdiction of this Tribunal.”°°

Claimant’s arguments

Claimant argues in respect of this first objection that at the time the improper transfer of
shares from Amruz and Seagroup to Naftogaz and the illegal taking of the Kremenchug
Refinery took place,**° Tatneft, the State Committee and both Amruz and Seagroup were
“aligned in interest,” the latter three having granted powers of attorney to Tatneft to
represent their interests.” As a result of this shareholder alliance, Tatneft’s shareholding
in Ukrtatnafta enjoyed “a significant enhancement in value.”°°* By depriving Amruz and
Seagroup of their shareholder rights, Respondent “has arrogated to itself a controlling

interest in Ukrtatnafta [...],°°

thus causing additional material damage to Claimant’s
investment.*”” Claimant further argues that “respondent’s objection that claimant may not

claim the enhanced value of its shareholding resulting from its shareholder alliance with

without the full recor and “[t]he extent to which this alliance which created a control

block increased the value of Tatneft shareholding is a question for the merits phase.”*”*

208. In addition, while it is correct to argue that Amruz and Seagroup are not parties to this
arbitration, Tatneft is entitled to claim as an indirect shareholder for the harm caused to its
interests by the expropriation measures affecting those companies.*”* Relying on Article 15
of the ILC Articles, Claimant argues that “the persistent failure of respondent to remedy the
raider action and the various court decisions that resulted in AmRuz and Seagroup losing
title to their shares constitute composite acts which began before claimant acquired an

indirect interest in Ukrtatnafta and which continued thereafter,”*”*

into an outright transfer of title to the shares in June 2009 [..1%7° Claimant points out that

resulted in [a] final and irrevocable judgment” and “[t]he court proceedings that actually
deprived AmRuz and Seagroup of their shares in Ukrtatnafta had not been initiated in

December 2007.”°”°

209. Finally, Tatneft argues that, because it was a shareholder in Amruz and Seagroup, it
decided not to cause them to pursue separate arbitrations under the Energy Charter Treaty
or the Ukraine-USA BIT “in an effort to streamline the resolution of claims.”*”’ Claimant
further contends that Respondent’s assertions that the acquisition of shares in these
companies would amount to impermissible forum shopping are inapposite because the
arbitrations pursued under those other treaties would be no less efficacious than the present
one and thus no advantage can be gained by resorting to the Russia-Ukraine BIT. On the

other hand, contrary to impermissible forum shopping such as that considered in Phoenix,

in this case there is no substitution of an entity in a State having an investment treaty for an

entity in a State not qualifying for treaty protection.*”

The Tribunal’s findings

210. Both parties are in agreement about the fact that neither Amruz nor Seagroup are parties to
this arbitration. In light of Respondent’s argument that it was not clear whether Tatneft
was claiming on behalf of Amruz and Seagroup or under some other entitlement and

38° the Tribunal has to address two

following Claimant’s clarifications at the hearing,
distinct issues: (i) the admissibility of Tatneft’s claim as an indirect shareholder for the loss
arising out of the alleged deprivation of Amruz’s and Seagroup’s shareholding in
Ukrtatnafta; and (ii) the admissibility of Tatneft’s claim arising out the exclusion of the
allied shareholders including Amruz and Seagroup and the consequential loss of the

“enhanced value” of Tatneft’s shareholding in Ukratatnafta.

21

. With respect to the first issue, Respondent insisted at the hearing that the Tribunal should
focus on two elements: first, whether Claimant’s interest in Amruz and Seagroup was
acquired before or after the events giving rise to the alleged harm and thus whether
Claimant met the legal requirement of being in control of the investment at the time the
alleged harm took place; second, whether this acquisition was made for litigation purposes
as opposed to commercial purposes.**! Tf both elements are present, Tatneft’s claim should

be held inadmissible.

212. Respondent has cited Mr. Zachary Douglas to the effect that if “Claimant maintains that its

investment has been expropriated, for example, then it must be able to demonstrate that it

had effective control over that investment at the time of the alleged expropriation.”**”

Because Tatneft acquired shares in both Amruz and Seagroup it might eventually qualify as

an indirect investor in Ukrtatnafta as far as the shares of these companies in the latter are

concerned,*** but still this status would have to exist at the critical date of the measures

affecting such companies.

The evidence produced by Claimant indicates that it acquired shares in Amruz and
Seagroup in December 2007.74 Respondent does not challenge that Tatneft had control of
Amruz and Seagroup after that date.**° A number of the acts complained of by Claimant,
especially the court proceedings that were commenced in 2008 and resulted in the sale of

Amruz’s and Seagroup’s shares by auction in June 2009,7*°

took place after the acquisition.
It is true, however, that Claimant, Amruz and Seagroup alleged in 2008 that the interests of
Amruz and Seagroup started to be adversely affected in 2007, i.e. prior to Tatneft’s
acquisition. In its Statement of Claim, Tatneft indicated that the improper transfer of
Amruz’s and Seagroup’s shares to Naftogaz in May 2007 deprived them of their
shareholder rights.°°7 Similarly, Seagroup stated in broader terms in its Notice of Dispute
dated 10 June 2008 that “[dJuring 2007, as a result of a series of actions and omissions of
the Ukrainian Government, the Ukrainian courts and enforcement officers, Seagroup has
been deprived of its shares in Ukrtatnafta and of its shareholder rights, suffering significant

19388

and ongoing damages. Amruz’s Notice of Dispute of 11 June 2008 is identically

worded and refers to the same date and events.”

As set forth in Chapter II, following an application for interim relief by the Ministry of Fuel
and Energy of Ukraine, Amruz and Seagroup were indeed ordered to transfer their shares in
Ukrtatnafta to Naftogaz on 22 May 2007.*” On 17 September 2007 and 30 October 2007,
the Economic Court and the Economic Court of Appeal of the city of Kiev successively
upheld claims from the Prosecutor General of Ukraine seeking the invalidation of the share

purchase agreements entered into by Seagroup and Amruz and ordered the transfer of their

shares to the State (represented by the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of Ukraine).*°' On 14

December 2007, according to Respondent, the Economic Court of the city of Kiev ordered

measures for the enforcement of its decision of 17 September 2007.7

215. In subsequent submissions, however, Claimant has given evidence of a third court action
that was initiated in February 2008, after its acquisition of shares in Amruz and Seagroup,

and resulted this time in a final and irrevocable decision to transfer these shares to a third

party.” By contrast, the outcome of the first court proceedings that took place in the first

half of 2007 was temporary by nature since the court ordered the transfer of the shares by

way of interim relief. The second court proceedings were stayed in May 2008 pending the

resolution of the third court proceedings and eventually discontinued in February 2009.34

It is only in late 2008, in the third court proceedings, that the issue of the validity of
Amruz’s and Seagroup’s share purchase agreements reached the Supreme Court of Ukraine
which then confirmed the annulment by the lower courts of the purchase agreements and
the order to return the shares to Ukrtatnafta.*°° The returned shares were then sold at an

auction in June 2009 to a company called Korsan, following a court order to that effect.*”°

216. While Claimant concedes that there is no evidence in the record that Claimant sought to

the Tribunal agrees that when Tatneft acquired its shares in Amruz and Seagroup, the court

favor of Amruz and Seagroup, in 2002 and as recently as April 2006. The prospect of
prevailing in the new proceedings of 2007 and 2008, though uncertain, was not

unreasonable or unlikely.

The Tribunal thus further agrees that the cumulation of the three above-described court
proceedings, which concerned the same issue and all resulted in the transfer of Amruz’s
and Seagroup’s shares to a third party, along with the alleged raid on Ukrtatnafta, should be
considered in aggregate to determine what the alleged breach was and when it occurred.‘°°
It is only in mid-2009, when the shares were auctioned and acquired by Korsan, or at the
earliest in late 2008, when the Supreme Court of Ukraine confirmed the lower court’s
decision to transfer Amruz’s and Seagroup’s shares to Ukrtatnafta, that it became clear that
Amruz and Seagroup had been fully and finally deprived of their shares. This repeated
pattern of allegedly harmful acts and decisions would aptly be characterized as a composite
act, the extent of which was revealed when it crystallized in the course of 2009. The
Tribunal thus concludes at least some of the alleged harm to its indirect investment

occurred after the acquisition of Tatneft’s shares in Amruz and Seagroup.

The Tribunal now turns to the second element of Respondent’s objection, namely that
Tatneft acquired its shares in Amruz and Seagroup for purposes of litigation, and thus

attempted to “forum shop.”

The Tribunal notes that while Amruz and Seagroup had in fact submitted notices of dispute
to Ukraine separately from Tatneft, which could have led to separate arbitrations under a
different bilateral investment treaty or the Energy Charter Treaty, the companies were of
course free to pursue the course of action they thought best for their interests, particularly
in view of the fact that Tatneft had acquired their shares. Claimant explains that the course
of action followed was that deemed to be more efficient as it avoided parallel arbitrations
and reduced costs for both parties.4! The Tribunal is not to sit in judgment of the parties’

litigation strategies, except when there might be some form of abuse.

Case 1:17-cv-00582-CKK Document 27-3 Filed 08/22/17 Page 81 of 92

Indeed, it is one thing to artificially build up a case for taking advantage of a given
arbitration forum, such as was considered in the Phoenix case noted above and other
investment arbitrations,“”? which is certainly not permissible because it amounts to an abuse
of rights or bad faith and possibly to misrepresentation of the facts to the tribunal, and quite
another to choose a given forum as a matter of legitimate convenience. The Tribunal notes
in this respect Claimant’s argument to the effect that no particular advantage could be
obtained by bringing a case to this forum as opposed to the Ukraine-US BIT or the Energy
Charter Treaty, and that in any event Claimant is not substituting a status of protected
investor for that of an investor which otherwise is not entitled to protection, which is the

essence of forum shopping.“

Similar standards of protection are available under the
various treaties mentioned; those standards might even be superior in some respects under
the Ukraine-USA BIT or the Energy Charter Treaty. There is no evidence that Tatneft’s
purpose was to defeat the nationality requirement of the applicable BIT, as argued by

Respondent.‘

The Tribunal concludes that the second element of Respondent’s admissibility objection,
namely that Tatneft acquired in Amruz and Seagroup solely for litigation purposes, is also
missing. Tatneft’s claim as an indirect shareholder for the loss arising out the alleged

deprivation of Amruz’s and Seagroup’s shareholding in Ukrtatnafta is therefore admissible.

The Tribunal finally turns to the alleged inadmissibility of Tatneft’s claim arising out the
exclusion of the allied shareholders and the consequential loss of the “enhanced value” of

its shareholding in Ukratatnafta.

The Tribunal notes that Respondent has not specifically alleged that this particular claim
would amount to forum shopping but rather that it has no legal or factual basis.“ In any
event, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant has convincingly argued that there existed

an alliance of shareholders before the alleged harm took place. The powers of attorney

44 See Respondent’s Oral Pleadings, Jurisdictional Hearing Transcript, 29 March 2010, p. 175. The Tribunal notes,
further, that the fact that Claimant’s case evolved over time to take into account new factual developments, and is

different in subsequent submis

 

ions from what it was in its Statement of Claim, is not prohibited and does not lead to

the conclusion that Claimant’s litigation strategy amounts to forum shopping.

when Claimant and the other allied shareholders together held 55.7% of Ukratatnafta’s

share capital.*””

224. The Tribunal further agrees that the issue is not whether “Tatneft’s involvement in the
shareholders alliance or the enhanced value it fosters are separate rights protected by the
Russia-Ukraine BIT” but rather whether “its involvement in the shareholders’ alliance
increases the value of its investment in Ukrtatnafta.”“°* Whether damages were caused to
Tatneft’s investment as a consequence of the alleged exclusion of the allied shareholders
and what their quantum is, if any, is not something to be decided at this stage; this will
require a full submission of the facts and evidence on the merits, including, inter alia,
detailed explanations about the legal nature of the shareholders’ alliance, a matter on which

the Tribunal put specific questions to Claimant at the jurisdictional hearing.“

Oil Deliveries

Respondent’s arguments

225. The second objection to admissibility made by Respondent is that Tatneft cannot claim for
unpaid oil deliveries because it did not have a supply contract with Ukrtatnafta and such
supply was done by the intermediation of several Ukrainian and Tatar companies.*!° A

request made by Ukrtatnafta to secure such contract was rejected by Tatneft on the grounds

that it had been made by an unrecognized official of the company following the dispute
about the appointment of Mr. Ovcharenko already noted, and it was thus Tatneft that chose
not to become Ukrtatnafta’s supplier.*"! In any event, this claim is unrelated to Claimant’s
alleged investment, i.e. its shareholding participation, and would at most involve a doubtful
contractual debt the situs of which is probably Tatarstan.‘ Relying on Joy Mining and
Romak, Respondent concludes that Claimant’s claim for unpaid oil is not a protected

investment within the meaning of the Russia-Ukraine Bir.

It is also noted in this respect
that the refusal to supply the oil results in a violation of the Republic of Tatarstan’s

obligations under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.*"

226. It is further explained that it appears that the same claims for oil deliveries have been
brought before the courts of Tatarstan by another company that exported oil produced by
Tatneft, Suvar-Kazan, and this company has obtained a decision in its favor and has seized

fais

assets of Ukrtatnafta by way of interim relie’ This confirms that the oil supplier to

Ukrtatnafta was not Tatneft but other companies either in Tatarstan or Ukraine.*!° Under

Ukrainian law parties cannot assign their claims to third parties.‘"” In the end there would

be a serious risk of Tatneft obtaining double recovery.*!*

227. Respondent also maintains that the temporal scope of considerations of admissibility is not
limited and can take into account developments occurring after the arbitration was initiated,
as was held in SGS v. Philippines."° Taking into account the evidence on events occurring

both before and after the date that these proceedings were instituted, the debt for oil

deliveries not only has been paid but has been “overpaid.” A number of assignments of
claims took place between some of the intermediary companies, in particular Avto and
Suvar-Kazan, and were invalidated by Ukrainian courts with the consequence that
Ukrtatnafta refused to recognize the validity of those assignments and make payments to

those companies.*”!

Those assignments artificially created jurisdiction in the courts of
Tatarstan, which granted the compensation noted and ordered the seizure of Ukrtatnafta’s
shares in Tatneftprom, representing the total contribution of Tatarstan to Ukrtatnafta.*””
Ukratatnafta, however, has paid its debts in full to Taiz and Tekhnoprogress, the Ukrainian

intermediaries.*

In Respondent’s view, it follows from the above facts that Tatneft has failed to state a
prima facie case concerning the claims for unpaid oil deliveries because it has not shown
how the measures adopted affected its investment and resulted in a breach of the Russia-
Ukraine BIT.‘* Relying on SGS v. Philippines Respondent asserts that the “mere refusal to
pay a debt is not an expropriation of property, at least where remedies exist in respect of

such a refusal.“

Claimant’s reliance on Siemens v. Argentina to claim for consequential damages from the
non-payment to other entities is in Respondent’s view misplaced.*”° That case accepted to
protect Siemens from claims of its contractors and suppliers against the company,” but
here Tatneft is seeking something quite different, namely that the Tribunal order Ukraine to

compensate Claimant for claims it has against third parties to which it would have supplied

oil.*8 This is not the meaning of the protection of investments under either the Russia-

Ukraine BIT or international law.“

Claimant’s arguments

231

S

Claimant asserts that it has not brought in this case a contractual claim for the breach of an
oil supply contract between Tatneft and Ukrtatnafta; rather, its claim is that the illegal
seizure of bank accounts and taking control of Ukrtatnafta by Mr. Ovcharenko has deprived
Tatneft of payment for oil deliveries and of the benefit to continue being the principal

supplier of oil to Ukrtatnafta.*”

231.

Because the critical date for determining admissibility is when the arbitration was instituted
(namely, 21 May 2008), and the Russian court decision in favor of Suvan-Kazan was
issued several months later (September 2008), the latter cannot be relied upon for raising an
objection to admissibility.**! That court decision can at the most have relevance in

determining the amount of compensation due, which is a matter for the merits.”

23)

N

Claimant also maintains that consequential damages have been awarded by tribunals when
the claims arise out of events that are the direct and immediate consequence of the host

State’s violation of its treaty obligations, as decided in the Siemens case, a matter which

483 Th this case the causal link results from

the fact that the illegal takeover of the Kremenchug Refinery resulted in non-payment to
intermediaries for oil supplied, which in turn have failed to pay Tatneft.**4

233.

o

It is also explained that the reason why Tatneft refused to enter into a supply contract with
Ukrtatnafta at the time it was proposed by Mr. Ovcharenko was not just that this official

was not recognized as having been validly appointed, but also because Tatneft was at the

time owed US$ 520 million by Ukrtatnafta for oil that had been delivered but not paid

for. A similar reason explains the interruption of oil supplies to the Kremenchug

Refinery in 2005.**°

234. Whether partial payments took place or not is a question concerning quantum and not

admissibility.*”

In any event, the payments made to both Taiz and Tekhnoprogress,
Ukrainian companies that together with Avto are under the control of businessmen related
to Mr. Ovcharenko, has not resulted in any payment reaching Tatneft but has rather

benefited entities connected to the new Ukrtatnafta administration.“

These payments
were objected to by the Ukrainian Prime Minister as “unlawful and have features of
financial machinations and considerably violate the interests of the major shareholders of
Ukrtatnafta, JSC.? Even if the payments ordered in connection with the seizure of
Ukrtatnafta’s shares in Tatneftprom materialize, they still fall short of the amount owed to

Tatneft.“

The Tribunal’s findings

235. The Tribunal must now turn to the examination of the objection to admissibility made in
connection with the question of unpaid oil deliveries to Ukrtatnafta. While no contract has
directly linked Tatneft to Ukrtatnafta in this matter, but instead a number of intermediaries
were used, the issue is still whether Claimant is entitled to receive payments for oil sold to
Ukrtatnafta and which have allegedly remained unpaid as a consequence of the measures
affecting the latter, particularly in terms of interventions in the bank accounts and financial

operations of the company following the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko.

236. Respondent has appropriately invoked the decision in Joy Mining in order to draw a

distinction between ordinary sales contracts, which in its view is the case here, and

investments.*' It has invoked the decision in Romak insofar as it required that if the parties

wished to consider some other transaction as an investment, including a “pure” “one-off
sales contract,” this would have to be worded in terms that leave no room for doubt about

the intention of the parties.”

Those findings are right insofar as contracts and similar transactions are concerned, but
here the claim consists of consequential damages relating to the events surrounding the
Kremenchug Refinery and the management of Ukrtatnafta, and not a contractual claim
between the Parties. In the Tribunal’s view, this is a matter that requires examination on
the merits and only then will it be possible to establish whether some breach of rights or
treatment has occurred and whether payment has been made, to whom, in what amount, and
under what entitlement. The Parties’ discussions about the meaning of Siemens in this
context are also relevant to the merits of the case. Therefore, while Tatneft’s claim for
consequential damages in relation to unpaid oil deliveries is admissible, complex questions
of litigation between some such intermediaries and Ukrtatnafta, including the seizure of
assets, and their eventual incidence on the issue of double recovery needs also to be

examined on the merits.

The Tribunal must also take note that Tatneft’s claim in this matter involves the allegation
that it lost its role as main supplier of oil to Ukrtatnafta and the potential significance of this
consequence for the value of its shares. Respondent asserts that Tatneft was offered the
opportunity to enter into a long-term oil supply contract with Ukrtatnafta and the offer was
refused by Claimant. There is no doubt a question concerning the role of Mr. Ovcharenko
in Ukrtatnafta that appears to have explained this refusal, but more importantly, a decisive
reason explained by Tatneft is that it was owed at the time millions of dollars and was not
willing to commit further resources with an uncertain future. However that may be, the
validity of this claim and its eventual resulting damages can only be assessed by the

Tribunal on the merits.

concerning Alleged Violations of its Rights under the BIT and Ensuing Damages
Respondent’s arguments

As noted above, Respondent originally objected to admissibility on the ground that
Claimant failed to state an arguable case that demonstrated prima facie that there was a
violation of the Russia-Ukraine BIT in respect of its rights as a shareholder in Ukrtatnafta,

or that harm and damages ensued from such claim.“

This objection, however, was
withdrawn in light of judicial proceedings taking place in Ukraine after Respondent’s
Reply on Jurisdiction was submitted.“4 This withdrawal was made without concession in
respect of the merits of this and related claims. Accordingly, it shall not be addressed by

the Tribunal at this stage.

As a factual matter, however, it is appropriate to note that the Economic Court of the
Poltava Region declared on 3 November 2009 that Tatneft’s purchase of shares
representing 8.613% of Ukrtatnafta had been unlawful and ordered Tatneft to return those
shares to Ukrtatnafta.“* No compensation for these measures has thus far been offered or

paid."

In addition to Respondent’s jurisdictional defense to the allegation that it breached Article
5(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT concerning the expropriation of shares, which has now
been clearly withdrawn, *4” Respondent also made in its Statement of Defense two other
arguments concerning the need for Claimant to make an arguable case. These objections

were not expressly withdrawn and therefore will be addressed by the Tribunal.

One such argument concerns the guarantee of legal protection to Claimant under Article

2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT, which provides:

Either Contracting Party shall guarantee, in conformity with its legislation, the
complete and unconditional legal protection of investments of investors of the
other Contracting Party. 48

Respondent asserts that such protection is not an unconditional guarantee of treatment and

it is different from a full security and protection clause.”

As such it cannot give an
investor an individual enforceable right under international law and, moreover, the
protection that is to be granted in conformity with Ukraine’s legislation has not been

removed and it could be enforced before the Ukrainian courts.”

The second of Respondent’s arguments concerns Article 3(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT,

which provides:

Each Contracting Party shall provide on its respective territory a regime for the
investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, and also with
respect to the activity involved in making such investments which regime shall be
no less favorable than the one granted to its own investors or investors of any
third state, precluding the use of discriminatory measures, which could interfere
with the management and disposal of those investments. '

While Claimant asserts that this provision “requires Ukraine to grant to Russian investors
and their investments treatment no less favorable than that granted by Ukraine to its own
investors or to investors of third States and their investments,” Respondent maintains that
the Article noted does not refer to “treatment” but to “a regime for the investments,” which
is a different matter as it addresses only a system of general application and not a specific
treatment to a certain investor.*°? Because this is not a case of most favored nation
treatment it cannot be used to import Article 2(2) of the United Kingdom-Ukraine BIT and
the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security therein envisaged, as

Tatneft pretends.**

Claimant’s arguments

246. In view of the withdrawal noted above it would not be appropriate to examine Claimant’s
arguments concerning Article 5(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT, but they shall be examined

in respect of Articles 2(2) and 3(1).

247. Claimant asserts that the failure to grant “complete and unconditional legal protection”
under Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT and the need to ensure most favored nation
treatment under Article 3(1), which in every version of Russian bilateral investment treaties
in other languages is translated as “treatment” and not “regime,” provide ample grounds to
consider that it is plausible that if the matter is discussed and proved on the merits the
alleged violations of the Russia-Ukraine BIT might be established to the satisfaction of the

Tribunal.**> Claimant submits that it has stated an admissible case in this respect.

The Tribunal’s findings

248. The Tribunal believes first that the reference to “complete and unconditional legal
protection” envisaged in Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT is not to be taken lightly in
that potentially it might involve a substantial guarantee of treatment benefiting the investor
in light of the facts of the case. This treatment can only be discussed in the context of the

merits of the case.

249. The Tribunal must also note that Claimant relies on the most favored treatment provided
for in Article 3(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT to the effect that it can invoke the application
of Article 2(2) of the United Kingdom-Ukraine BIT. The latter Article provides for fair
and equitable treatment and the enjoyment of full protection and security, which Tatneft
considers applicable because it grants a more favorable treatment to British investors and
their investments in Ukraine. Again this particular claim can only be considered in the
context of the specific treatment envisaged, which is a matter for the merits. At that point it
will also be necessary to examine whether Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT is in
some respect analogous to Article 2(2) of the United Kingdom-Ukraine BIT, or entails a

different kind of legal obligation.

250. At this stage, however, the Tribunal is satisfied that these claims are admissible. While it is
not implausible to argue that the events described might have compromised fair and
equitable treatment and full protection and security if the standard of the United Kingdom-
Ukraine BIT is held applicable in this respect, or if the Russia-Ukraine BIT is interpreted to
encompass similar obligations, these issues are of course also matters to be decided at the

merits.

251.

It should be noted, as explained in the narrative of facts above, that Article 3(1) has also
been invoked in connection with Article 8(1) of the United Kingdom-Ukraine BIT which
entitles U.K. investors to commence arbitration after a three-month waiting period rather
than the six-month period envisaged in the Russia-Ukraine BIT, and which consequently
affords more favorable treatment to such investors.**° This issue has not been objected to

in the context of jurisdiction or otherwise and hence will not be addressed by the Tribunal.

252. In light of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the objections to
admissibility of Tatneft’s claims cannot be upheld, without prejudice to the examination of
defenses on the merits and the evidence offered at that stage about the manner in which
Respondent may have breached the Russia-Ukraine BIT, and the related damages and links

of causality with the measures taken.
