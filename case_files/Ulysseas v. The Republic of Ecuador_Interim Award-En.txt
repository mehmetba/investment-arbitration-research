CHAPTER I - PROCEDURAL HISTORY
A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND CONSTITUTION OF THE

ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

1. On 8 May 2009, Claimant served a Notice of Arbitration on Respondent alleging breaches
of the Treaty between The United States of America and The Republic of Ecuador

concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the “BIT”).

2. By letter dated 31 July 2009 and pursuant to Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
(the “UNCITRAL Rules”), Claimant informed Respondent of its appointment of Professor

Michael Pryles as the first Arbitrator.

3. By letter dated 1 October 2009 and pursuant to Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Rules,

Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern as the second Arbitrator.

4. On 30 October 2009, the Co-arbitrators agreed on the choice of Professor Piero Bernardini

as Presiding Arbitrator.

5. By letter dated 3 November 2009, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that the
Tribunal had been duly constituted and invited Respondent to submit its Answer to

Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration by 23 November 2009.

6. On 23 November 2009, Respondent submitted its Answer to Claimant’s Notice of

Arbitration in accordance with the Tribunal’s direction.

7. By letter dated 25 November 2009, the Tribunal noted the Parties’ agreement to retain the
Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) as administrator of the proceedings and

concurred with this agreement.

8. By letter dated 27 November 2009, the Tribunal sent to the Parties draft Terms of
Appointment and Procedural Rules for their review and comment by 18 December 2009,

and invited the Parties to agree on a calendar for the proceedings by the same date.

9. By letter dated 9 December 2009, the Tribunal confirmed that the initial hearing would be

B.

Page 5 of 65

informed the Parties that the PCA had appointed Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as the
administrative secretary for the case and invited them to confirm that they agreed to the

appointment by 18 December 2009.

By separate letters dated 18 December 2009, Claimant and Respondent successively
informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to agree on a procedural calendar,
indicated their respective position on said calendar, and provided their comments on the
draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules circulated by the Tribunal. Respondent
also confirmed in its letter its acceptance of the terms by which Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu
would serve as administrative secretary to the Tribunal. Claimant did so in a subsequent

letter dated 21 December 2009.

By letter dated 23 December 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated
updated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules in anticipation of the initial

hearing.

By letter dated 12 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed
the Parties that, due to bad weather conditions in Europe and additional professional
commitments, Mr. Pryles would be unable to attend the initial hearing in person on 15

January 2010, but would attend by video conference.

By letter dated 13 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated
further updated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules in anticipation of the

initial hearing.

Signed originals of each document were handed out to each Party and member of the
Tribunal. Having heard the arguments of the Parties with respect to the case, the Tribunal

decided to bifurcate the proceedings and established the procedural calendar.!
WRITTEN PHASE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

By letter dated 20 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated
the summary minutes of the initial hearing that took place on 15 January 2010, along with
an audio-CD containing the recording of the initial hearing. The PCA invited the Parties to
submit their comments on these summary minutes by 27 January 2010. The PCA also
circulated on behalf of the Tribunal Procedural Order No. 1 dated 20 January 2010, which

set out the procedural calendar established at the initial hearing.

By letter dated 20 January 2010, Claimant noted a disparity between Procedural Order No.
1 and the summary minutes of the initial hearing with respect to the date by which the first
round of document productions should be made, and asked the Tribunal for clarification.

By letter of the same date, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the

Parties that the correct date was 29 January 2010, not 27 January 2010, and circulated a

duly amended Procedural Order No. 1.

By letter dated 22 January 2010 and in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant

submitted its First Request for the Production of Documents.

By letter dated 22 January 2010 and in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1,
Respondent submitted its Request for Production of Documents in the form of a Redfern

Schedule.

By letter dated 25 January 2010, Claimant submitted a Redfern Schedule relating to

Claimant’s document requests.

By letter dated 29 January 2010, Claimant submitted its responses and objections to
Respondent’s Request for Production of Documents dated 22 January 2010 in the form of a

Redfern Schedule, along with a document entitled Responses and Objections.

By letter dated 29 January 2010, Respondent submitted, in the form of a Redfern Schedule,
its responses to Claimant’s First Request for the Production of Documents dated 22 January

accordance with the schedule established in Procedural Order No. 1, circulated Procedural

28.

Page 8 of 65

Order No. 2 which recorded the Tribunal’s decision on the Parties’ Requests for Document
Production. Procedural Order No. 2 provided, inter alia, that Claimant had to produce
certain documents in response to Respondent’s Request No. 4, provided that the Parties

entered into a confidentiality agreement regarding these documents.

By letter dated 19 February 2010, Respondent drew to the Tribunal’s attention that
Claimant was refusing to accept certain provisions of Respondent’s executed agreement on
confidentiality, and on that basis was refusing to produce the documents responsive to
Respondent’s Request No. 4 until a confidentiality agreement has been reached.

Respondent requested the Tribunal to direct the Parties as follows:

A. to confirm that the Claimant’s refusal to accept the terms of the Respondent’s
already executed agreement on confidentiality is unreasonable;

B. to confirm that the Respondent has executed and delivered an agreement on
confidentiality that is sufficient for the Claimant to produce the documents
responsive to the Respondent’s request No. 4, as required by Procedural Order
No. 2;

C. to instruct the Claimant to produce such documents forthwith and within 24
hours of the Tribunal so directing;

D. to amend the procedural schedule to take account of the Claimant’s delay in
producing documents in accordance with Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 2, so
that the time period for submitting Respondent’s Memorial on Jurisdiction
extends to one month from the date on which the Claimant produces the requested
documentation; and

E. to draw the appropriate inferences from the Claimant’s refusal to accept the
Respondent’s executed confidentiality agreement.
After further correspondence between the Parties on this issue, the PCA, by letter dated 23
February 2010 and under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the
Tribunal had examined the Parties’ exchange of correspondence relating to the
Confidentiality Agreement and invited the Parties to reconcile their positions without delay

so as not to disrupt the agreed calendar of the proceedings.

Following a further exchange of correspondence between the Parties regarding Claimant’s
document production, and a letter from Claimant dated 24 February 2010 informing the

Tribunal that the issue regarding the conclusion of the confidentiality agreement should be

resolved without the need for intervention by the Tribunal, the Parties entered into a

Confidentiality Agreement on 26 February 2010.7

In subsequent correspondence exchanged by the Parties on 5, 9, and 16 March 2010, the
Parties further discussed Claimant’s document production and compliance with Procedural

Order No. 2.

By letter dated 19 March 2010, Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary
Objections to Jurisdiction with Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities in accordance with

Procedural Order No. 1.

By letter dated 19 April 2010, Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Objections to
Jurisdiction, with supporting Witness Statements, Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities in

accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.

By letter dated 10 May 2010, Respondent submitted its Reply with Legal Authorities in

accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.

By letter dated 12 May 2010 and following confirmation by Respondent of its availability,
the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, confirmed that the hearing on jurisdiction
would be held on 17-18 June 2010 in The Hague in the Peace Palace and invited the Parties

to agree on a hearing schedule by 7 June 2010.

By letter dated 20 May 2010, Claimant informed Respondent that “Elliott Associates, L.P.
is willing to provide documents further supporting Mr. Veldwijk’s statement regarding Paul
Singer’s control over the other two general partners in Elliott Associates, L.P.” on the
condition that “the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Ulysseas and the
Republic of Ecuador dated February 25, 2010 are extended to include Elliott and any
document produced by Elliott, and any such documents are treated as ‘Confidential
Material’ pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.” Claimant also enclosed

a letter to this effect from Elliott Associates, L.P.

By letter dated 25 May 2010, Respondent replied to Claimant’s letter dated 20 May 2010
stating that Claimant did not comply with Procedural Order No. 2 in a timely fashion and

“may not do so now at this late stage.”

By letter dated 31 May 2010, Claimant submitted its Rejoinder with Legal Authorities in

accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.

By letter dated 7 June 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the

Parties of the Tribunal’s following directions:

J. In application of Section 3.3 of the Procedural Rules of January 15, 2010,
Claimant shall produce the documents indicated in its letter of May 20, 2010
regarding Paul Singer’s control over the other two general partners in Elliott
Associates L.P. This evidence, which is directly relevant to the question of
jurisdiction to be decided by the Tribunal, is not covered by Procedural Order
No. 2.

2. Claimant's request that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with
Respondent dated February 25, 2010 be extended to cover the documents to be so
produced is justified in light of Elliott Associates’ counsel’s letter of May 20,
2010. Respondent is therefore invited to agree to such extension.

3. These additional documents shall be produced not later that June 14, 2010.
Respondent shall have an opportunity to comment on such documents either in
writing soon thereafter or in the course of its oral submission at the hearing.

4. Ona different matter, Claimant is invited to have available at the hearing the
unredacted text of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) dated January 18, 2002 (C-
JURI-42) and of the Amended JVA dated June 29, 2007 (C-JURI-44), should the
Tribunal decide to inspect them.

The Tribunal having granted a one-day extension to the Parties, at their request, for the
submission of a hearing schedule, Claimant, on behalf of the Parties, informed the Tribunal
of the agreed schedule by letter dated 8 June 2010. The schedule indicated, inter alia, that

Mr. Zacharia Korn, one of Claimant’s witnesses, would testify before the Tribunal.

By letter dated 10 June 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the

Parties that the proposed hearing schedule was agreeable to the Tribunal.

By e-mail dated 15 June 2010, Claimant submitted electronic copies of the documents that

it was requested to submit pursuant to paragraph 1 of the PCA’s letter dated 7 June 2010,

Page 11 of 65

and informed the PCA that hard copies of the documents had previously been provided to
Respondent under cover of the Parties’ Confidentiality Agreement. By letter of the same
date, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal and in accordance with paragraph 3 of
the PCA’s letter dated 7 June 2010, informed the Parties that Respondent was invited to
submit its comments on the above-mentioned documents at the upcoming hearing on

jurisdiction.

43. By letter dated 15 June 2010, Respondent submitted English translations of certain Fact
Exhibits and Legal Authorities.

in a similar fashion that the “Brazilian Synergy Group [is] controlled by Mr. German

purpose of Proteus’ formation was to provide services to Ulysseas by operating the power

barges that it owned.”°

61. On 15 June 2010* and at the hearing on jurisdiction,” Claimant provided evidence which,
in its view, showed that Mr. Singer controls Ulysseas. At the hearing, Respondent stated
that Claimant’s evidence “seems to show that Mr. Singer does control [...] this limited
partnership called Elliott Associates LP which sits at the top of the initial corporate chart

offered by the claimant.”

Respondent further indicated that it would accept that Mr.
Singer is an American national.** Respondent, however, argued that “the line of control
between Ulysseas and Elliott is broken” by the JVA and “diverted to the Synergy Group

and to Mr. Efromovich.”””

their rights and responsibilities under the two charter party agreements.**

65. According to Claimant, Ecuador opened up its electricity sector to private investment in
2003 in order to satisfy rapidly growing demand.” Claimant alleges that to take advantage
of those liberal market conditions, it imported and installed PBI and PBII in Ecuador in late

March/early April 2003 and April 2005, respectively."!

66. On 12 and 14 July 2004, Ulysseas applied to the Consejo Nacional de Electricidad

identical dispute resolution provisions, which read as follows:

DISPUTE RESOLUTION. — In the event of controversies or differences that arise
between the parties and that cannot be resolved between them, they shall be
subject to Ecuadorian law and be resolved through alternative arbitration and
mediation procedures, in accordance with law, and administered in accordance

governing the power sector in Ecuador, including the payment system applicable to private
thermoelectric generators like Ulysseas,”° and ultimately left Claimant’s investment devoid
of value.”” According to Claimant, Ecuador’s actions amount to a violation of its right
under the BIT to fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and protection

against unlawful expropriation.”*

In Respondent’s view, PBI, which only operated from April to October 2006, was unfit for
its purpose due to technical defects.” On 18 February 2008, Claimant requested that the
PBI Licence Contract be terminated by mutual agreement of the Parties® and subsequently
informed CONELEC that PBI would be recycled.*! Respondent also argues that Claimant
failed to fulfill its obligations under the PBII Licence Contract,*? and eventually left no
choice to CONELEC but to assume temporary operation of PBIL® Respondent believes

that Ulysseas’ claims fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

CHAPTER III - CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES

75.

76.

Respondent alleges that Claimant has waived its right to bring claims against Respondent
under the BIT with respect to its investment in Ecuador, and even if Claimant is held not to
have waived arbitration against Respondent under the BIT, Respondent has denied

Claimant the advantages of the BIT in accordance with its Article 1(2).

According to Claimant, Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction are
groundless.*° Respondent’s argument based on waiver “fail[s] to overcome the strong

presumption against a claimant’s contractual waiver of treaty rights granted under the BIT”

and the alleged waiver does not apply to Ulysseas’ treaty claims.*” In addition, the
provisions of Article I(2) of the BIT, which Respondent incorrectly interprets, do not apply

in this case.**
A. THE ALLEGED WAIVER BY CLAIMANT OF ITS RIGHT TO BRING CLAIMS UNDER THE BIT

1. The possibility for an investor to waive by contract its right to arbitration under a
BIT

(a) Respondent’s contentions

77. Respondent is of the view that an investor can contractually and in advance waive its right

to bring claims before an arbitral tribunal under a Bir.

78. Respondent contends that Claimant’s waiver is consistent with general rules of
international law as evidenced in arbitral practice and scholarly writings.” Many
investment treaties give the choice to investors to waive their procedural right to have their
treaty claim heard by an international arbitral tribunal by instead prosecuting these claims

91

before the municipal courts of the host State.” Respondent gives the example of “fork-in-

the-road” provisions.””

79. Referring to Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia, Vivendi v. Argentina” and commentary,”°

 

Respondent insists that “in the presence of a clear waiver of international remedies by the

Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, paras. 76 and 98, Exhibit R-X, and argues
that the relevant clause in that case was not considered an effective waiver because it “did not demonstrate a clear
intention by the Parties to exclude international arbitration.”

°5 Memorial, para. 82. Respondent refers to Paulsson, J, Denial of Justice in International Law (2005) p. 32, Exhibit R-
BB. See also Memorial, para. 83. Respondent refers, inter alia, to Spiermann, O, “Individual Rights, State Interests and
the Power to Waive ICSID Jurisdiction under Bilateral Investment Treaties” (2004) 20(2) Arbitration International 179,
p. 205, Exhibit R-C.

Page 24 of 65

investor, effect should be given to that waiver,””° including when the waiver is contained in

a contractual clause.°” In Respondent’s view, “[t]he basic principle in each case is that a

binding exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract should be respected, unless overridden by

another valid provision.”

80. Respondent alleges that its proposition finds further support in cases regarding the
interpretation of the so-called Calvo clause,” in particular North American Dredging
Company of Texas (United States) v. United Mexican States.'° Taking the example of
Deweer v. Belgium,'°! Respondent further considers that its position is consonant with “the
general position that individuals have the prima facie power to waive their rights if they so
choose.”! Arbitration being consensual, there is no rule of international law preventing an
investor to validly waive arbitration under the BIT? In addition, there is no such

prohibition in the text of the applicable BIT. 04

81. Respondent therefore disagrees with Claimant’s proposition that there is a “strong

presumption” against a claimant’s contractual waiver of the right to BIT-based arbitral

jurisdiction.'° The authorities relied upon by Claimant in fact support Respondent’s
position and confirm that an investor may waive contractually its right to resort to

international treaty arbitration in advance.'°°

(b) Claimant’s contentions

82. According to Claimant, contractual waiver of treaty-based arbitral jurisdiction is
“disallowed” or “disfavored.” There exists, in Claimant’s view, a presumption against

such contractual waiver.'°*

Contrary to Respondent’s position, a private party cannot
abrogate in advance by contract the agreement that Ecuador has made with the United

States.

dichotomy which the tribunals in those cases was not faced with.'!°

85. Claimant further asserts that treaty-based fork-in-the-road clauses and Calvo clause awards
cannot be relied upon to buttress the applicability of contractual waiver on the following
grounds: first, fork-in-the-road provisions are set out in the applicable BIT and do not

7

depend on contractual provisions; they are also different from an advance waiver in so

far as they offer a choice to the investor at the time the dispute is submitted for

resolution;! 18

deal with the ability of a party to waive an international tribunal’s jurisdiction over contract

claims and therefore are not relevant to the present claim for breach of the BIT.!”

provided for under BITs would ultimately discourage foreign investment and contradict the
public interest.'2° Indeed, Respondent cannot ignore that “[...] contractual waiver of BIT
rights is prohibited because it would allow State parties to give lip service to their

international commitments, while undermining those commitments by a contract. tt

The alleged waiver in Article 30 of the Licence Contracts of Claimant’s right to
resort to arbitration under the BIT

(a) The express and clear waiver allegedly contained in Article 30 of the Licence
Contracts

(i) | Respondent’s contentions

87. Respondent contends that Article 30 of the Licence Contracts contains a clear and
unambiguous waiver of recourse to international arbitration under the BiT.'” First, the
negotiating history of the Licence Contracts demonstrates that while Claimant was not

required to waive this right under Ecuadorian law, Claimant nonetheless agreed to do so

freely. ~~” Second, Respondent is of the view that the use of the phrase “the express waiver
of any other national or international jurisdiction [...], public or private” in Article 30
clearly encompasses all dispute resolution procedures available to the Parties.'”4 Contrary
to Claimant’s argument, the reference to “international jurisdiction” can only mean that the
Parties intended to waive recourse to international BIT arbitration, given it is the only

obvious instance of international jurisdiction available to Claimant in this case.!?°

88. Furthermore, Respondent contends that Claimant’s reliance on Occidental v. Ecuador to
argue that Article 30 does not contain a clear waiver, is misplaced.'7° First, the contract in
that case provided expressly for ICSID jurisdiction.!7” Second, the issue was not whether
waiver language generally excludes resort to arbitration under an investment treaty.'°
Third, the scope of the contractual waiver in question was significantly narrower than that

of Article 30.'”

89. Finally, while Claimant wrongly argues that Respondent bases its jurisdictional objection
on a mere arbitration or forum selection clause,'~” Respondent emphasizes that it instead

relies “on the express waiver” contained in Article 30.'3! Instead of focusing on the

waiver contained in that provision, which it does not.!?

(ii) Claimant’s contentions

90. In Claimant’s view, Article 30 is insufficiently specific for it is not an exclusive forum
selection clause that explicitly and clearly renounces the jurisdiction of tribunals constituted
under the BIT.'*? Rather, it refers only to “any other public or private [...] international
jurisdiction” without mentioning the BIT or tribunals constituted under the BIT.'* While
Respondent incorrectly argues that “public [...] international jurisdiction” can only refer in
this case to arbitration under the BIT,!*> Claimant contends that there are at least three

counterexamples of public international fora for disproving Respondent’s point. 136

91. Claimant also relies, inter alia, on Occidental v. Ecuador,'" concerning a clause in the
parties’ Participation Contract that is similar to, and even broader than, !°8 Article 30, which

the tribunal held to be insufficiently clear and unequivocal to amount to a waiver!”

92. Finally, Claimant submits that Article 30 consists of a positive agreement to arbitrate in

Quito, which must be balanced by a negative renunciation of jurisdiction.'“° Whereas

Respondent seeks to separate the negative renunciation of jurisdiction from Article 30,

Claimant submits that they go hand in hand.'"!

(b) The alleged identity of the Parties to the Licence Contracts and to this arbitration

(i) | Respondent’s contentions

Respondent asserts that CONELEC acted “in representation of the Ecuadorian State” — as
explicitly stated in the Licence Contracts — thereby making Respondent a party to the

: 142
Licence Contracts.

While Claimant relies on Article 2 of the Ley de Régimen del Sector
Eléctrico (“LRSE”) for the proposition that CONELEC is a separate entity independent of
the Ecuadorian State, Respondent asserts that the wording of Article 2 “does not render the
State (i.e., the Respondent) a third party to the Licence Contracts.”'*? Other provisions of
the Licence Contracts, in Respondent’s view, indicate that Claimant contracted with
Respondent. 4 Tn particular, Respondent refers to Article 23, which concerns changes in
legislation affecting the autonomy of the Grantor that Respondent only could introduce,'*°
and to Article 24, a stabilization clause providing that “the State” shall acknowledge
damage to “the investor” if laws or regulations cause injury or amend contractual
provisions. 4° Moreover, “[iJf the parties truly intended for CONELEC to act as a separate
and independent entity from the Respondent, any change in legislation would have
constituted a force majeure event and not a breach of the Grantor’s obligations.”!4” That is
not the purpose of Article 25 of the Licence Contracts and its reference to “authorities

exercising public office” does not relate to Ecuadorian public authorities.'“*

94. In addition, Respondent argues that Articles 3(c) and 5(a) of the Ley Orgdnica de la
Procuraduria General del Estado “expressly allow [it] [...] to initiate and defend arbitral
proceedings, involving public entities such as CONELEC.”'” The State Attorney General
could thus initiate arbitration against Ulysseas under the Licence Contracts in
representation of the Ecuadorian State.!° Further, while Claimant wrongly asserts that the
State can only bind itself to arbitration with the express consent of the Attorney General,

Respondent contends that in 2005 and 2006, “there was no need for the Attorney General to

approve arbitration clauses in contracts with the state or with a public entity.”! '

Additionally and contrary to Claimant’s allegations, “there is clear practice in Ecuador
which allows a party which has entered into a concession contract with a public entity that
has separate legal personality to sue the state as a whole directly.”!>? Respondent adds that,

even if the State were to argue that it cannot be sued, Ulysseas would have a claim for

153

denial of justice. Lastly, because CONELEC’s actions are attributable at public

international law to the State,’ Claimant’s argument that its waiver is not subject to the

international rules on attribution of conduct to the State cannot stand.'*

95. Respondent finally argues that Claimant’s reliance on Azurix v. Argentina, Aguas del

156

Tunari v. Bolivia and Impregilo v. Pakistan,” where the respondent State argued that it

was not a party to the relevant contract, is misconceived.'*”

(ii) Claimant’s contentions

96. Claimant asserts that Respondent is not a party to the Licence Contracts; rather, CONELEC
is, and Claimant “never agreed to waive its right to arbitrate BIT claims before an
UNCITRAL tribunal against Respondent.”'** Claimant is of the view that CONELEC is a
separate and independent entity under Ecuadorian law on the basis of Articles 2 and 12 of

the LRSE.'? — Claimant argues that Respondent’s relevant concession law_ itself

“distinguishes between CONELEC, a party to the Licence Agreement, and the State”! In

161

Claimant’s view, Article 24 of the Licence Contracts has the same effect. In addition,

the force majeure provision in Article 25 would be rendered useless if Respondent were

162

bound to the Licence Contracts. Claimant refers to Azurix v. Argentina, Aguas del

Tunari v. Bolivia, and Impregilo v. Pakistan to support its arguments that tribunals have

held that arbitration clauses in concession contracts signed with government agencies or

entities, as is CONELEC, do not waive treaty-based claims against the Government.!®

97. Claimant also argues that Respondent’s reliance on Articles 3(c) and 5(a) of Ecuador’s Ley
Organica de la Procuraduria del Estado’ is insufficient to support Respondent’s
position. In Claimant’s view, the fact that CONELEC is State-owned and may
“represent” Respondent, or even make certain guarantees that bind Respondent, or that
Respondent may from time to time intervene in CONELEC’s legal proceedings does not

mean that Respondent and CONELEC “are one in the same, or that Ulysseas or the non

CONELEC cannot agree to an arbitration agreement that binds the State without the

“practice” of allowing Ecuador to be sued where a party has entered into a contract with a

separate public entity. 170

98. Finally, Claimant points out that “Respondent has never claimed [...] that it will answer a

Quito arbitration or pay an award emanating from that arbitration.”!7!

Article 30 are therefore sufficiently wide to encompass Claimant’s BIT-based claims.'”°

100. According to Respondent, “the mere fact that the waiver is contained in a contract does not
mean that it is limited in scope to only contractual claims.”!”” In fact, Claimant implicitly
accepts Respondent’s position when it recognizes that BIT-based arbitration may be waived
provided that the waiver is sufficiently specific. Referring to Eureko v. Poland,
Respondent takes the example of a settlement agreement between the State and the investor
which had the effect of waiving both the contractual and treaty claims of the investor.'78
Seen in its proper context, Article 30 is specific enough to encompass “the entire
relationship between Ulysseas and the Republic of Ecuador as the state granting the

concession for the operation of the power barges.”!”

101.

Respondent also argues that Claimant would not have an investment under the BIT without

the Licence Contracts.'*°

Claimant’s rights under the Licence Contracts amount to
Claimant’s “investment” under Article 1(a)(v) of the BIT.'*! While Claimant’s Barges are
also investments under the BIT, Claimant’s operation of those Barges in Ecuador would not
have been possible without the Licence Contracts.'*? Relying on Mihaly v. Sri Lanka,'**
Respondent contends that the admission of Claimant’s investment was subject to the
Licence Contracts, which consequently represent all of the agreed terms, including the

waiver, upon which Claimant made its investment.!**+

Respondent also emphasizes that the Licence Contracts contain substantive protections that

and not paralle to those provided in the BIT, “confirm[ing] that the

intention to waive arbitration under the BIT in Article 30 “deprives the Tribunal of

jurisdiction over the entirety of the Claimant’s claims,”!”

(ii) Claimant’s contentions

Claimant argues that the scope of Article 30 is much more limited than Respondent alleges
it is: (1) the use of the terms “disputes or differences of opinion [...] between the parties” to
the Licence Contracts and the absence of broadening language (such as “all disputes” or
“any differences of opinion”) show that the parties intended for Article 30 to apply only to
contractual disputes under Ecuador law between CONELEC and Ulysseas;!*! (2) the phrase
“between these parties” refers to CONELEC and Ulysseas and does not even purport to

192

refer to Respondent; ~ (3) Article 30 contains the agreement of the “parties [...] to be

3

subject to Ecuadorian law,” not BITs or international law;'? and (4) disputes “will be
resolved by alternative mediation and arbitration proceedings, based on the law, conducted

in accordance with the Mediation and Arbitration Law of Ecuador, its Regulations and the

B. RESPONDENT’S ALLEGED DENIAL TO CLAIMANT OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE BIT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ITS ARTICLE I(2)
1. Interpretation of the terms of Article I(2) of the BIT

(a) Respondent’s contentions

107. Respondent contends that it was clearly entitled to, and did apply, the plain terms of the
BIT to deny its advantages to Claimant.2” Indeed, under Article I(2) of the BIT, each Party
to the Treaty reserves the right to deny the advantages (a) to “any company,” in which case
the only applicable condition is that “nationals of a third country control such company,”
and (b) to “a company of the other Party,” in which case one of two additional conditions

must be met:

(i) either that company of the other Party “has no substantial business activities

in the territory of the other Party”; or

(ii) that company “is controlled by nationals of a third country with which the

denying Party does not maintain normal economic relations.”?””

?°8 Counter-Memorial, para. 32. Claimant argues that permission to operate the Barges in Ecuador was granted by

CONELEC through Certificates issued on 12 April 2005 and 11 September 2006 separately from the Licence Contracts
and neither contained an arbitration clause; in any case, the Barges arrived in Ecuador before these Certificates were
issued on 31 March 2003 and 16 April 2005 respectively.

108. Respondent contends that the meaning of “control” in a legal context “includes the legal

19208

capacity or entitlement to control another entity. Respondent further argues that

“control” for the purposes of Article I(2) of the BIT should be distinguished from

ownership or an ownership interest?” and may be based on a “contractual relationship,”

1

including the fact of being a general partner.”! Respondent asserts that United States

212

investment treaty practice confirms this position. Further, in Respondent’s view,

“control may be held or exercised directly or indirectly” such as through intermediary

213 «e

entities; control may be either de jure or de facto,” i.e. amounting to “the legal potential

or ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operations of the

99,214 ee

Claimant”; ‘control may be held or exercised exclusively or jointly with others,”?5

including through a joint venture agreement;”'° and control must be established
2

“immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute’ "7 as is

the case for Article VI(8) of the BIT, for Claimant to qualify as a company of the United
States. By restricting the meaning of control to “direct ownership,” Claimant fails to

interpret the terms of the BIT in accordance with the vcLT.28

109. Respondent further argues that the reference to “nationals of a third country” in Article I(2)
of the BIT is concerned only with natural persons and not companies.”"° Respondent notes,
in support of its position, that Article I(1)(c) of the BIT defines a “national” as “a natural

person,” that Article I(2) must be contrasted with provisions that refer to both “nationals

99220

and companies, and that this interpretation is the only way of reconciling Article I(2)

221

with Article VI(8), which refers to “nationals or companies. In addition, Respondent

refers to the Letter of Submittal of the BIT, asserting that denial of the benefits of the BIT

was reserved for parent companies “ultimately owned by non-Party nationals.””-2

(b) Claimant’s contentions

110. In Claimant’s view, Article I(2) of the BIT must be construed such that Respondent is able
to deny Claimant the advantages of the BIT only if Claimant is controlled by nationals of a
third country and (not or) either Claimant has no substantial business activities in the

United States, or Claimant is controlled by a national of a third country with which

3

Respondent has no normal economic relations.°> Claimant submits that this view is

supported by commentary to Article I(2) in the Letter of Submittal from the United States

With respect to “control,” Claimant agrees that “control” means the “legal capacity to

1,228

contro However, Claimant does not agree with Respondent’s view that “control”

should be defined according to the definition set forth in Article I(1)(j) of the United States-
Poland BIT.” This would lead to the “absurd” result that the tribunal “should scale an

endless ladder of corporate entities in order to reach an undefined third-country national

that directly or indirectly ‘controls’ Ulysseas.”?*”

112. Furthermore, because Article I(2) is only one of two instances where “control” is referred

9231

to without reference to “ownership, and is the only instance where the BIT limits the

investor’s protections, “control” should be interpreted to mean only direct control,”

99233

“consistent with the BIT’s object and purpose. Claimant alleges that Respondent’s

quotation of the definition of “Company” in the Letter of Submittal of the BIT is
incomplete.” Rather, the full definition shows it is meant to broaden the class of protected

investors.”*>

113. Finally, having initially asserted that that the term “national” includes companies,”*°

Claimant now argues that “national” means a natural person and is “a narrowing function”

requiring that the host State prove control of the company by a third-country national.?*”

2. The alleged “control” of Claimant by a national of a third country, Mr.
Efromovich

(a) Respondent’s contentions

114. Respondent submits that Claimant was at all relevant times controlled by Mr. German

Efromovich, a Brazilian national,”** through Proteus, Veredas, and the Synergy Group.?”

115. Respondent relies on a number of press reports to argue that Claimant was perceived as a
Brazilian company, belonging to Mr. Efromovich.”” Respondent further contends that Mr.
Efromovich did have an interest in Ulysseas which derived from Proteus, the Joint Venture

between the Elliott Group and Veredas, the latter being a Bahamas company of the non-

24!

United States Synergy Group controlled by Mr. Efromovicl Respondent also contends

that Proteus, also a Bahamas company, presented Claimant’s power generation project in

Ecuador in 2002 and had a central role in the operation of the Barges;”* Claimant “has

represented itself to be an ‘affiliate’ of Proteus.””**

116. Respondent further emphasizes that in the relevant provisions of the JVA, “the only matters

that are exclusively within the Elliott Group’s discretion are the approval of capital

commitments and of expenditure on goods and services’ 45 the express and positive

consent of Veredas is required, however, for essentially all key decisions of Proteus.“° The

Amendment to JVA did not change this."

According to Respondent, the JVA “limited and limits what Ulysseas may do.”*4* Indeed,
other provisions of the JVA indicate that Ulysseas is considered an “affiliate” of Elliott
Group as defined in the JVA, capable of incurring the default of the Elliott Group under the
agreement.” Similarly, the grants of powers of attorney to Messrs Korn and Abad Guerra
(representatives of Veredas), were made subject to the limits set forth in the Iva?
suggesting that control of Ulysseas “lies with the entities behind the JVA, and in particular

with Veredas and the Synergy Group.”?"!

Respondent thus considers that “the Joint
Venture Agreement [...] in fact was a shareholding agreement for the control and for the
conduct of Proteus which tied in the affiliates of each of the parties,” including Ulysseas,””

and broke the line of control between Ulysseas and the Elliott Group.” 3

Finally, Respondent contends that it was entitled to presume that nationals of a third
country control Claimant on two grounds: (i) Claimant waived recourse to arbitration under
Article 30 of the Licence Contracts; and (ii) Claimant did not comply with Procedural
Order No. 2 which required Claimant to produce documents relevant to the question of its

control.”

(b) Claimant’s contentions

119. Claimant argues that it is wholly controlled by a national of the United States, Mr. Paul

p256

Singer, through Elliott Associates, L. Claimant further argues that it was not an

“affiliate” of Proteus but rather a “partner,” which is a more accurate translation of
“asociada”;?” Claimant was not controlled by Proteus and Proteus itself was not controlled
by the Brazilian Mr. German Efromovich.*** Claimant submits instead that Proteus was
controlled almost completely by Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P., by
virtue of the JVA and the Amendment to JVA2? In particular, under the Amendment to
JVA, Veredas transferred “a significant amount of its [...] shares [in Proteus]” to Elliott
Associates and Elliott International, leaving the latter two entities with a combined 60%
shareholding interest in Proteus.2 Furthermore, Elliott Associates and Elliott International
acquired the right to appoint an additional director to the board of Proteus, which Claimant
contends gave Elliott Associates and Elliott International “virtually total” control over

261

Proteus. Control by Mr. Efromovich would have been impossible because the Synergy

Group subsidiaries have never owned more than 50% of Proteus and “neither Mr.
Efromovich, the Synergy Group, nor any of the subsidiaries or affiliates of the Synergy

Group have ever had any shareholder interest, direct or indirect in Ulysseas or its parent

companies.””°

120. Claimant also submits that its granting of powers-of-attorney to individuals including
Zacharia Korn, Boris Patricio Abad and Cristina Cajiao Luna gave them authority to act on

behalf of Ulysseas but not to control the company.” Similarly, the Administrative and

Professional Services Agreements with Rubiales and Prime do not give either Rubiales or

Prime control over Claimant?“

121. In any event, Claimant insists that all the JVA does is establishing control of Proteus.”°5
While Proteus’ role was to find business opportunities for Ulysseas, the JVA does not force
Ulysseas to take up those opportunities.”°° The JVA is not an exclusive arrangement and is

not binding on Ulysseas.””

3. The alleged lack of substantiality of Claimant’s business activities in the United
States

(a) Respondent’s contentions

122. Respondent argues that Claimant has no substantial business activities in the United States
for the purposes of Article (2) of the BIT on the following grounds:?°* first, “substantial
business activities” is undefined in the BIT and should be understood to mean “important”
business activities;?” second, Claimant’s “only productive assets” are the Barges, which
are located outside of the United States in Ecuador and are managed by Proteus, in turn
managed through individuals of Brazil and Ecuador;?”” third, “Claimant does not conduct
regular trading activities in the United States”??”! and fourth, “Claimant has no known
premises or employees of its own, but instead contracts other entities such as Prime to
oversee its affairs in Ecuador.” The only evidence Claimant has adduced is that it filed
tax returns in the United States, that its sole corporate officer, Mr. Pollock, works from

3

New York City, and that it purchased PBII in Texas, United States.?” According to

26 Counter-Memorial, paras. 121-124. Claimant refers to the Administrative and Professional Services Agreement

Respondent, this “confirms that Ulysseas is in fact merely a ‘shell’ company with minimum

presence in the United States.”?”*

(b) Claimant’s contentions

123. In Claimant’s view, since the BIT does not define “substantial business activities,” a good
faith interpretation of the BIT reveals that it is the “materiality not the magnitude of the

99275

business activity [that] is the decisive question. The question is therefore one of

« A pe 992
‘economic benefit.”?”°

On that basis, Claimant submits that it conducts “substantial
business activities” in the United States: first, Claimant’s corporate officers have worked
primarily from the United States; second, PBII was purchased from a Houston-based,
Delaware-organized company; third, Claimant’s Assignment and Assumption
Agreements””” are governed by Texan law; fourth, Claimant is managed by a United States
company with corporate offices in the United States; and fifth, Claimant has consistently

filed tax returns in the United States.7”

S

. The question of the timeliness of Respondent’s denial of the advantages of the BIT

(a) Respondent’s contentions

124. Respondent submits that it denied to Claimant the advantages of the BIT in a timely fashion
on two grounds:?” first, Article I(2) of the BIT reserves a right for each party to deny the
advantages of the BIT, which is not qualified by any time limit, and the existence of which
should be determined on a case-by-case basis;?°° second, Claimant knew of Respondent’s
expectation to deny the advantages of the BIT from the outset, Claimant having waived

recourse to arbitration under Article 30 of the Licence Contracts.”*!

commencement of these proceedings,”* Respondent argues that that position “is not

supported by either the text of the BIT or notions of ‘legal certainty’ 73 Claimant’s

reliance on authorities interpreting Article 17(1) of the ECT is inappropriate: (1) neither
Respondent nor the United States are parties to the ECT; (2) unlike Article I(2) of the BIT,
Article 17(1) of the ECT concerns the denial of the substantive benefits of the ECT only, as

opposed to the advantages of the entire treaty.>**

126. Respondent instead relies on Empresa Electrica v. Ecuador where the State exercised its

right to deny advantages at the first session of the tribunal which then held that Ecuador

285

had exercised its right in a timely fashion.” While general principles of international law

may well impose a time limit on the exercise of the right to deny the advantages of the BIT,
Respondent has acted reasonably by invoking the denial of advantages as a preliminary
objection to jurisdiction.?*° Finally, according to Respondent, it would not be feasible in
practice to ask host States to monitor all investors to check whether they are controlled by

third party nationals at the time they invest, as suggested by Claimant.?*”

(b) Claimant’s contentions

127. Claimant is of the view that Respondent must have positively exercised the right to deny
benefits before violating its international law obligations in order to effect denial.2**

According to Claimant, positive State action requires prospective “reasonable notice,” in

light of the fact that the BIT aims to promote foreign investment in Ecuador,”

certainty.”?°°

128. Claimant relies upon several decisions, including Plama v. Bulgaria and Yukos v. Russia,
where the tribunal concluded that a denial of the ECT protections required not merely the
invocation of a right but positive action on the part of the State, such as notice, and rejected
retrospective application of the denial of benefits clause which would offend an investor’s
legitimate expectations”! or the objective of the Ect? Empresa Electrica v. Ecuador, by
contrast, cannot be relied upon in this proceeding””* as “the tribunal did not reach the
question of whether Respondent’s ‘invocation’ of the denial was a proper exercise of the

denial-of-benefits provision.”?”*

require investors to disclose whether they are controlled by third-country nationals.””°

Claimant did not comply with the requirements of Procedural Order No. 2 in at least four

respects. 298

First, Respondent alleges that Claimant unilaterally redacted the JVA and the Amendment

to JVA contrary to Procedural Order No. and belatedly raised grounds of

confidentiality for such redaction.*” This and the fact that Claimant obtained the JVA

from Proteus” suggest that “Claimant is an instrument of the joint venture between the

Elliott Group and Synergy Group. Respondent finally objected to Claimant’s proposed

Second, Claimant unjustifiably withheld its management contract with Prime existing at the
time Claimant commenced these proceedings,*™ where that management contract would
reflect the relationships between Mr. Efromovich, the Synergy Group, the Elliott Group,

Prime and Claimant.*°°

Third, Respondent argues that Claimant deliberately avoided its obligation pursuant to
Procedural Order No. 2 to produce documents evidencing authorization of specific
proposals for electricity sales agreements that Claimant purports to have made in
Ecuador.*°° Respondent thus invited the Tribunal to infer that the authorization must have

originated from Proteus.*””

components of this Abbreviated Ownership Structure. Claimant further contends that
“Respondent’s refusal to consent to an in camera inspection [of the JVA and Amendment

139. Second, Claimant argues that it has not “withheld” an engagement contract with Prime per

Claimant furnished Respondent with agreements linking Prime to Ulysseas through

Rubiales.*”*

person to authorize the proposals made by Ulysseas for entering into power purchase
agreements” by adducing documents showing that the authorizations were effected through

a chain of powers-of-attorney.*?°

Fourth, Claimant states that Procedural Order No. 2 required it to produce documents

which it did.* In any event, Claimant contends that Paul Singer’s control over Elliott
Associates, L.P. and Ulysseas is unquestionably established by the documents it produced

on 15 June 2010.”

CHAPTER IV - THE TRIBUNAL’S FINDINGS

A.

INTRODUCTION

145.

146.

147.

As reflected by the Parties’ contentions described in Chapter III, two are Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections. On one side, Respondent contends that in Article 30 of the
Licence Contracts Claimant has waived its right to bring claims under the BIT (hereinafter,
“the alleged waiver of treaty claims”). On the other, by exercising the right reserved to it by
Article I(2) of the BIT, Respondent has deprived Claimant of the advantages of the BIT,
including its dispute settlement provision (hereinafter, “the alleged denial of BIT’s

benefits”).

The Parties have argued extensively regarding both jurisdictional objections, as reflected by
the summary of their respective contentions under Chapter III. Claimant requests the
Tribunal to confirm that its claims are within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and are admissible.
Respondent requests a decision that all of Claimant’s claims are beyond the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction or, in the alternative, are not admissible. Each Party requests that the other pay

all costs associated with these proceedings.

The Tribunal will separately consider the alleged waiver of treaty claims and the alleged
denial of BIT’s benefits based on the Parties’ arguments and the evidence filed by each of
them in support of their respective contentions. The Tribunal’s finding regarding the two
jurisdictional objections concludes that Claimant’s claims are within its jurisdiction for the

reasons developed below in this Chapter.

include compensation for Ulysseas’ full dollar value of its investment in Ecuador, including but not limited to: the value

B. THE ALLEGED WAIVER OF TREATY CLAIMS

148.

149.

150.

The Parties have discussed, among other questions, whether an investor may waive by
contract its right to arbitration under a BIT. As made manifest by their opposing
arguments, the heart of the Parties’ debate lies in establishing whether an investor may
choose to waive, in advance of any dispute which might arise in the future between that
investor and the host State under the treaty, the treaty protection agreed between the
contracting States. Obviously, an investor may freely waive to bring a treaty claim after a
dispute has arisen, when all factual and legal aspects of the case are available permitting a

considered choice whether or not to assert a claim in arbitration under the treaty.

The Tribunal is aware of the negative conclusion reached by other investment treaty
tribunals regarding the investor’s choice under a contract with the State of a dispute
settlement method other than the one available to it under a given treaty, before any dispute
has arisen. In view of its decision in the present case, the Tribunal does not need to express
an opinion on the subject. It believes that in any case the investor’s waiver of the treaty
arbitration is subject to the essential condition that the waiver be freely agreed by the
investor. Any pressure or compulsion by the host State to obtain by contract the investor’s
waiver of the treaty protection may well constitute a breach by the State of the obligation it
has assumed vis-a-vis the other contracting State regarding the protection of that State’s
investor. There is no evidence in the file of these proceedings that Claimant’s acceptance of
Article 30 of the Licence Contracts, assuming it is a waiver of the BIT arbitration, was due

to Respondent’s compulsion or other form of pressure.

The question whether Claimant has waived its right to resort to arbitration under the BIT in
Article 30 of the Licence Contracts deserves an in-depth analysis due to its multifaceted

aspects.
Article 30 of the two Licence Contracts reads as follows in the original Spanish text:

SOLUCION DE CONTROVERSIAS - En caso de controversias o diferencias que
surjan entre las partes y que no pudieran ser solucionadas entre las mismas, se
sujetardn a las leyes ecuatorianas y serdn resueltas mediante el procedimiento
alternativo de conciliacion y arbitraje, en derecho, y administrado con sujecion a
la Ley de Mediacion y Arbitraje del Ecuador, de su Reglamento de Aplicacion y

54 Supra, paras. 77-86.

Page 53 of 65

del Reglamento de los Tribunales de Arbitraje de la Camara de Comercio de la
ciudad de Quito, con expresa renuncia a cualquier otra jurisdiccién nacional o
internacional o la via diplomdtica, ptiblica o privada. Adicionalmente las partes
contratantes convienen en que: La Autoridad nominadora del Tribunal
conformado por tres drbitros serd la Cémara de Comercio de Quito y, que el
idioma a utilizarse en el procedimiento de conciliacién y arbitraje sera el
castellano.

151. In order for the alleged contractual waiver by Claimant to be effective, the parties involved
must be identical. The parties to the contracts which, according to Respondent, would have
given effect to the waiver by Claimant of the BIT arbitration, i.e. the two Licence
Contracts, should be Ulysseas, on one side, and the State of Ecuador, on the other. Only
these two parties could have in fact waived a dispute settlement method available to them
under the BIT by adopting the one regulated by Article 30 of the Licence Contracts. The
Parties, fully aware of this indispensable condition, have strenuously argued this aspect,
Claimant by denying that the State is a party to the Licence Contracts, and Respondent by
contending that the State is a party to the Licence Contracts since CONELEC signed them

“en representacion del Estado Ecuatoriano.”***

152. It is the Tribunal’s view that the State of Ecuador is not party to the Licence Contracts, for

the reasons that are given below.

153. CONELEC, the National Electricity Council, was created by the LRSE “as a legal entity
subject to public law, with its own resources and administrative, economic, financial and
operational autonomy.”**7 It is part of CONELEC’s functions and powers, among others,
“to grant permits and licences for the installation of new power generation units and to give
authority for the signature of concession contracts for the generation, transmission and
distribution to the Executive Director of CONELEC in conformity with the applicable

Regulation.”***

555 Respondent's English translation of Article 30 of the Licence Contracts is reproduced supra, para. 72.

56 This formulation is in Article 1 of both Licence Contracts where the signatory parties are described as appearing
(“Comparecientes”) before the notary public in Quito on 15 August 2005 for PBI (Exhibits C-JURI-38 and R-9) and 12
September 2006 for PBII (Exhibits C-JURI-40 and R-5).

 

57 Ley de Régimen del Sector Eléctrico, Art. 12: “Constitucién. - Créase el Consejo Nacional de la Electricidad
CONELEC, como persona juridica de derecho piblico con patrimonio propio, autonomta administrativa, econémica,
financiera y operativa” (Exhibit C-JURI-K).

154.

155.

156.

Page 54 of 65

The State of Ecuador has therefore created a special entity with separate legal personality,
having its own assets and resources, capable of suing and being sued and entrusted with
functions and powers to regulate the electricity sector on behalf of the State. The effect of
creating a public entity to regulate a specific sector of State activity, with the power to sign
contracts with third parties in that sector, is to avoid the direct responsibility of the State for
that sector’s activity. It would be contrary to this purpose to make the State party to
contracts signed by the public entity with third parties, thereby assuming a direct

responsibility towards those parties for the contract performance.

Truly, Article 1 of the Licence Contracts, when describing the parties appearing before the
notary public in Quito refers to CONELEC as being there “en representacién del Estado
Ecuatoriano como asi lo determina el articulo dos de la Ley de Régimen del Sector
Eléctrico.”* Respondent relies on this qualification of CONELEC to conclude that the
State is the party to the Licence Contracts with Claimant. Article 2 of the Law in question,

referred to in Article 1 of the Licence Contracts, states as follows:

Concesiones y Permisos. — El Estado es el titular de la propiedad inalienable e
imprescriptible de los recursos naturales que permiten la generacion de energia
eléctrica. Por tanto, sélo él, por intermedio del Consejo Nacional de Electricidad
come ente ptiblico competente, puede concesionar o delegar a otros sectores de la
economia la generacién, transmisién, distribucién y comercializacién de la
energia eléctrica.

Referring to this provision of the law in the context of the description of CONELEC as

signatory to the Licence Contracts simply highlights that CONELEC is acting in the

capacity and within the powers granted to it by the law in question “como ente piiblico

competente.”

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal adds that although CONELEC is an entity
separate from the State, its conduct in performing the powers and duties assigned to it by

the law may be attributed under public international law to the State in specific

 

distribucin al Director Ejecutivo del CONELEC de conformidad a lo que seftale el Reglamento respectivo” (Exhibit
C-JURI-K) (the translation in the text is of the Tribunal). In conformity with Article 13 (n) of the LRSE, both Licence
Contracts were signed by CONELEC’s Executive Director.

circumstances. Reference is made to Article 5 of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of

States for International Wrongful Acts, providing as follows:

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article
4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the
governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international
law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular
instance.

The fact that the conduct of a person or entity may be attributed to the State in given
circumstances confirms that the conduct is that of the person or entity, and not of the State.
Were it the conduct of the State it would not need to be attributed to the State. This
Article clearly states that only acts performed by a separate entity with the use of elements
of governmental authority (“puissance publique’) are attributed to the State, not acts

performed in a commercial capacity, as are contracts.

The Tribunal’s conclusion that CONELEC, not the State of Ecuador, is party to the Licence
Contracts is confirmed by various contractual provisions to which the Parties have made
reference. When properly analysed, all these provisions make manifest that a clear
distinction is made between CONELEC as party to the Licence Contracts and the State as
the sovereign power whose actions, external to the contract, may have effects on the
Parties’ respective rights and obligations. Three provisions of the Licence Contracts will be

considered in that regard.

Article 23 provides for CONELEC’s responsibility, as Grantor (“OTORGANTE”), to
compensate the Licensee (in our case, Claimant) for any changes in legislation, regulation
decision or other rule (“ley, regulacién, resolucién u otra norma”) to the Licensee’s

prejudice. It is evident that any such changes may only be the result of State’s acts.

Article 24 refers to Article 271 of the Constitution according to which the State, “a través
del OTORGANTE?” (i.e. CONELEC), may establish special guarantees and assurances in
the investor’s favour so that no modifications shall be made to the contracts (“los
convenios’’) by laws or other provisions “de cualquier clase.” Should any law provisions
result in prejudice to the investor or in the modification of the contractual provisions,
compensation shall be paid to the investor for the resulting damage or prejudice, so as to re-

establish the financial and economic stability that would have prevailed in the absence of

160.

161.

162.

Page 56 of 65

such acts or decisions. Since compensation will be paid “a través del OTORGANTE,” it is
clear that the distinction between the State and CONELEC is again confirmed by this

provision of the Licence Contracts.

The same distinction is also confirmed by Article 25, dealing with force majeure or
fortuitous case (“Fuerza Mayor o Caso Fortuito”). The list of events exempting either party
from responsibility includes “the acts of authority exercised by a public officer” (“los actos
de autoridad ejercidos por un funcionario piblico”). There is no reason to restrict “acts of
authority” to acts of non-Ecuadorian authorities, as suggested by Respondent.” Therefore,
since also the State of Ecuador’s acts (through a public officer) may exempt CONELEC
from responsibility for the duration of the force majeure, the State and CONELEC are
clearly different entities, CONELEC being the party to the Licence Contracts which may

experience a force majeure situation due to the State of Ecuador’s acts.

Respondent relies on Articles 3(c) and S(a) of the “Ley Organica de la Procuracién
General del Estado” of 13 April 2004,*4! allowing the State, through the same authority by
which it is represented in this arbitration, to initiate and defend arbitral proceedings
involving public entities such as CONELEC.*” It appears from the analysis of these
provisions of the Ley Organica that the functions of the Procurador General del Estado
include supervising proceedings involving “entidades del sector ptblico que tengan
personeria juridica” (Article 3(c): this is the case of CONELEC) and the filing of legal
actions involving “Jas entidades u organismos del sector puiblico” (Article 5(a): this, again,
is the case of CONELEC). Under the same law, the Procurador General del Estado also
has the function to “[e]jercer el patrocinio del Estado” (Article 3(a)), which confirms the
distinction between the State and a public entity (such as CONELEC). The intervention in
these proceedings of the Procurador General del Estado on Respondent’s side is part of

that authority’s functions.

For the reasons given above, this Tribunal concludes that there has been no waiver by
Claimant of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction over its BIT claims against the State as a result of

its acceptance of Article 30 of the Licence Contracts. CONELEC, not the State of Ecuador,

is in fact party to such contracts. The agreement in Article 30 of the forum for disputes is an

agreement between the Claimant and CONELEC, not between the Claimant and the

Respondent State of Ecuador, and can only concern the contract claims of the Claimant

against CONELEC. Accordingly, Claimant’s BIT claims in these proceedings are within

the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.“

163. In view of this conclusion, there is no need to analyse the content of Article 30 of the
Licence Contracts, specifically whether, as discussed between the Parties, it covers the

disputes and claims in this BIT arbitration.
C. THE ALLEGED DENIAL OF BIT’s BENEFITS

164. In its first written submission, Respondent has denied Claimant, under Article I(2) of the
BIT, the advantages of the BIT, both substantive and procedural, including the right to have

recourse to arbitration before this Tribunal.*“* Article (2) of the BIT provides as follows:

Each Party reserves the right to deny to any company the advantages of this
Treaty if nationals of any third country control such company and, in the case of a
company of the other Party, that company has no substantial business activities in
the territory of the other Party or is controlled by nationals of a third country with
which the denying Party does not maintain normal economic relations.°°

165. Respondent’s denial of the advantages of the BIT was based on the circumstance that, in its
view, available documentation indicates that Claimant is controlled by a national of a third
country, namely Brazil or Bolivia,™® and that it has no business activities in the territory of
the United States.*"” As reflected by the part of Chapter III dealing with the Parties’

8

contentions on this subject," the Parties disagree whether the conditions for the

applicability of Article I(2) of the BIT are satisfied in the instant case. Respondent contends

that Claimant has not been able to rebut its objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the

*3 Tt is the Tribunal’s view that this is an objection to jurisdiction and not an objection to admissibility, as sometimes
referred to by the Parties.

basis of Respondent’s denial of the BIT’s advantages to the Claimant.*”” Claimant replies
that Respondent has not discharged its burden of proving that such conditions have been

met.*°°

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the burden of proving that the conditions for the
exercise of the right to deny the BIT advantages is to be borne by Respondent as the party
advancing this specific defence to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.**! This is the rule dictated by
the UNCITRAL Rules governing these proceedings.** To establish which conditions are to
be proven for a denial of BIT advantages to be valid and effective requires interpreting

Article I(2) of the BIT in the light of the VCLT. Article 31(1) of the VCLT provides that

A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose.

Applying this rule of interpretation to the instant case, two cumulative conditions must be

met for Respondent to deny Claimant the BIT advantages:

a) Claimant must be controlled by third party nationals, and
b) either Claimant does not conduct substantial business activities in the United States
or Claimant is controlled by nationals of a third country with which Respondent does not

maintain normal economic relations.

The Parties agree that these are the relevant conditions under Article I(2) of the BIT and
that they must be met cumulatively.>* The Tribunal notes that if it is proven that Claimant
is controlled by a United States national there will be no need to prove the other condition,
the right to deny the BIT benefits being in such a case excluded. The Parties agree also that

the term “control” means the “legal capacity to control.”*** However, they disagree

regarding whether control must be exercised “directly,” as argued by Claimant,*® or may

be exercised “indirectly,” as asserted by Respondent.***

169. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the terms of Article I(2) of the BIT, when
read in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty, are meant to
limit “control” to direct control or also embrace indirect control. The Tribunal notes in that
regard that Article I(1) of the BIT defines a certain number of terms “(f)or the purposes of
this Treaty,” i.e. with regard to any and all of the treaty provisions. Letter (c) of this Article
defines “national” of a Party (i.e., either the United States of America or the Republic of
Ecuador) to mean “a natural person who is a national of a Party under its applicable

993
law.”

170. Only natural persons may be at the upper end of the chain of control of a company, the last
company in the chain having natural persons as shareholders or general partners. This
means that in order to satisfy the control test under Article I(2) of the BIT the natural

person who is the ultimate controller of Ulysseas and its nationality must be identified.

171.

Prior to establishing whether the evidence in the file permits identification of the natural
person ultimately controlling Claimant, the Tribunal will answer certain questions that have
been raised by the Parties and which may bear on the validity and effect of Respondent’s

notice of denial of the BIT’s advantages to Claimant.

172. The first question concerns whether there is a time-limit for the exercise by the State of the
right to deny the BIT’s advantages. In the Tribunal’s view, since such advantages include
BIT arbitration, a valid exercise of the right would have the effect of depriving the Tribunal
of jurisdiction under the BIT. According to the UNCITRAL Rules, a jurisdictional
objection must be raised not later than in the statement of defence (Article 21(3)). By
exercising the right to deny Claimant the BIT’s advantages in the Answer,*** Respondent
has complied with the time limit prescribed by the UNCITRAL Rules. Nothing in Article
(2) of the BIT excludes that the right to deny the BIT’s advantages be exercised by the

State at the time when such advantages are sought by the investor through a request for

arbitration.

173. A further question is whether the denial of advantages should apply only prospectively, as
argued by Claimant, or may also have retrospective effects, as contended by Respondent.
The Tribunal sees no valid reasons to exclude retrospective effects. In reply to Claimant’s
argument that this would cause uncertainties as to the legal relations under the BIT, it may
be noted that since the possibility for the host State to exercise the right in question is
known to the investor from the time when it made its the investment, it may be concluded
that the protection afforded by the BIT is subject during the life of the investment to the

possibility of a denial of the BIT’s advantages by the host State.

174. As provided by Procedural Order No. 2 of 10 February 2010 (point 10), the date on which
the conditions for a valid and effective denial of advantages are to be met in the instant case
is the date of the Notice of Arbitration, i.e. 8 May 2009, this being the date on which

Claimant has claimed the BIT’s advantages that Respondent intends to deny.

175. Having thus established the time under Article I(2) of the BIT when the natural person who
ultimately controls Ulysseas must be identified, the Tribunal will proceed to determine
whether the evidence provided by the Parties permits such identification. Based on the
established terms of reference and the available evidence, it is the Tribunal’s conclusion
that Claimant has conclusively proven that Mr. Paul E. Singer, a national of the United

States of America, controls Ulysseas. The analysis that follows supports this conclusion.

176. The Abbreviated Ownership Structure Chart (the “Chart”) filed by Claimant*” shows that
Claimant is 100% owned by Highwood Partners L.P., which is in turn owned by Highwood
Associates, Inc. (as to 1%) and Elliott Associates L.P. (as to 99%), the latter owning 100%
of Highwood Associates. This has been accepted by Respondent,*” subject to an objection
that shall be considered below.*°! The Chart does not show, however, who controls Elliott

Associates.

The Thirteenth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of Elliott Associates
L.P. dated 1 July 2009, between Paul E. Singer, Elliott Capital Advisors, L.P. and Elliott
Special GP, LLC, filed by Claimant, shows that Elliott Associates has three general

partners.

However, this document does not permit the identification with certainty of the natural
persons controlling the latter two entities. Specifically, it does not permit to conclude that

Mr. Singer is the only general partner of those entities.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s direction of 7 June 2010, Claimant has filed on 15 June 2010 a
certain number of documents proving conclusively that Mr. Paul E. Singer is the natural
person ultimately controlling Ulysseas. The documents in question have been produced

under cover of the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties.

At the hearing, Claimant requested that the “Singer structure above the Claimant [...] not
be detailed by name, so that the confidential information is not...” [Counsel’s intervention
incomplete]. It is the Tribunal’s understanding that this request refers to the documents
filed under cover of Claimant’s e-mail of 15 June 2010. There is no need to describe in
detail the ownership structure above Elliott Associates L.P. considering that Respondent
has accepted at the hearing both this structure’ and the fact that Mr. Paul E. Singer is a

national of the United States.**°

The Tribunal will now consider Respondent’s objection to the ownership structure above

6

Ulysseas, as described in the Chart produced by Claimant,** namely that “the line of

control between Ulysseas and Elliott Associates L.P. is broken: it is broken by virtue of the
joint venture agreement and it is diverted to the Synergy Group and Mr. Efromovich.”*”

The basic premise of this objection is that “control” as legal capacity to direct the actions of

a company is not limited to ownership. It may be exercised through contractual rights when

there are contractual rights which are not revocable.
182. This concerns the JVA between Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P., on
one side (the “Elliott Group”), and Veredas, on the other, dated 18 January 20027”.
Pursuant to the JVA, Proteus was established, Elliott Group and Veredas each owning 50%
of the company. Proteus is party as Charterer to two Bareboat Charter Party agreements
with Claimant, as Owner (as successor to the previous owners of the two Barges),
regarding the one PBI and the other PBII?”. By the Amendment to JVA dated 29 June
2007,°"' the participations to Proteus were modified, Elliott Group now owning 60% and
Veredas 40%. Also under the Amended JVA, however, fundamental decisions regarding

Proteus continue to require the consent of both joint venture parties.°”

183. According to Respondent, Veredas is a Bahamian company of the non-United States
Synergy Group controlled by Mr. German Efromovich.*” It is Respondent’s submission
that as a result of the Amended JVA, the conduct of Ulysseas, as an affiliate of Elliott
Group, is beholden as to vital aspects of its decisions over the Barges,*” including budget
for expenditures of the Barges and signature of power purchase agreements, to the written

consent of Veredas, a company controlled by a Brazilian national, Mr. Efromovich.*”

184. The consequence, according to Respondent, is that Claimant is subject to legal control of
the Synergy Group, and of its ultimate controller Mr. Efromovich, since its conduct with

regard to the Barges remains subject to the JVA2"* It is Respondent’s submission that this

is an instance of control for the purpose of Article I(2) of the BIT.*”” The control in this
case is obtained “through a contractual mechanism.”*”* Also the powers of attorney granted

by Ulysseas were made expressly subject to the limits of the JvAs”

Respondent’s position is therefore that Claimant is controlled through the Amended JVA
by the joint-venture party, Veredas, the latter having a veto power over vital decisions
regarding the business that is the subject of the joint venture. Since Veredas is ultimately
controlled by a Brazilian national, Mr. Efromovich, Claimant is controlled by a national of

a third country.

The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s reasoning for a number of reasons. Firstly, the
veto power enjoyed by Veredas under the Amended JVA does not give that party a control
over the affairs of Proteus. The latter’s inability to conduct its business by reason of
deadlocks in the decision-making process would bring about the dissolution of the
company, **” each joint venture party regaining in that case full and independent freedom of

action.

Further, even admitting that Veredas exercises a measure of control over Proteus, this
would only mean that Veredas, and through it the ultimate controller of the Synergy Group,

Mr. Efromovich, controls Proteus as Charterer of PBI and PBII.

However, controlling the Charterer of PBI and PBII, the two Barges owned by Claimant,
does not mean controlling the Claimant but only controlling a line of Proteus’ business. As
suggested by a question put to Respondent’s counsel during the hearing by one

Arbitrator, 381

control over a company’s business does not give control over the company.
The latter may always change its line of business should its shareholders or partners so
decide by providing the necessary financial resources, abandoning the line of business that

has proved to be inoperable or uneconomical.

For all the reasons stated above, Respondent’s objection that the line of control between
Claimant and Elliott Associates is broken by reason of the JVA in favour of the Synergy
Group and Mr. Efromovich cannot be accepted. While this suffices to dispose of the
Respondent’s defence, it should also be pointed out that the Respondent has not established

the nationality of Mr. Efromovich.

Claimant has produced conclusive evidence that Ulysseas is controlled by a U.S. national,
Mr. Paul E. Singer. Accordingly, Claimant’s claims in these proceedings are within the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction and are admissible.

This decision is also in reply to Claimant’s request for a declaration that it has complied

with its obligations under Procedural Order No. 2.382

With regard to Claimant’s further prayer for relief concerning future reliance by
Respondent, if any, on undisclosed documents,*** the Tribunal reserves any decision in that

respect if and when that situation shall occur.

CHAPTER V - DISPOSITIVE PART OF THE DECISION

193.

382

383

For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides:

a

that the two objections presented by Respondent do not deprive the Tribunal of its
jurisdiction over all treaty claims presented by Claimant in these proceedings;
b) to make the necessary order for the continuation of the procedure;

c

to reserve all questions concerning the costs of arbitration, as defined by Article 38
of UNCITRAL Rules, for subsequent determination;
d

to dismiss any other relief requested by either Party, concerning the jurisdictional

phase of the arbitration.
