INTRODUCTION

THE PARTIES

The Claimant in the present arbitration is L.C.W. Europe Investments-Europa Nova Limited
(“ICW” or the “Claimant”), a company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom,
with its registered address at 788-790 Finchley Road, London, United Kingdom. The Claimant
is represented in the proceedings by Prof. Luca G. Radicati di Brozolo, Avv. Michele Sabatini,
Mr. Emilio Bettoni, and Mr. Flavio Ponzano of ARBLIT- Radicati di Brozolo Sabatini
Benedettelli, Via Alberto da Giussano, 15, 20145 Milan, Italy.

The Respondent is the Government of the Czech Republic, a sovereign State (the “Government”,
or the “Respondent”, and together with the Claimant, the “Parties”). The Respondent is
represented in these proceedings by Mr. Paolo Di Rosa of Arnold & Porter LLP, 601
Massachusetts Avenue NQ, Washington, D.C. 20001-3743, United States; Mr. Dimitri Evseev
of Arnold & Porter LLP, Tower 42, 25 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1HQ, United Kingdom;
Ms. Karolina Horakova and Libor Moravek of Skils s.r.o. advokatni kancelar, Kfizovnické nam.
193/2 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic; and by Ms. Marie TalaSova, Ministry of Finance of the
Czech Republic.

BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE,

The proceedings arise out of an investment made by the Claimant in the photovoltaic sector in
the Czech Republic. A dispute has arisen between ICW and the Government in respect of the
alleged cancellation of the legal, tax, and regulatory incentive regime that had previously been

established by the Czech Government in the photovoltaic sector.

The Claimant has commenced arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Government of the Czech and Slovak
Federal Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 26 October 1992 (the
“BIT”), and the Energy Charter Treaty of 16 April 1998 (the “ECT”).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATIONS

On 8 May 2013, the Claimant, together with nine other investors, jointly filed a single Notice of

Arbitration for a multi-party arbitration.

The Claimant designated Prof. Luca Radicati di Brozolo and Mr. Michele Sabatini of Bonelli
Erede Pappalardo Studio Legale (Milan) as its lead counsel. While these attorneys left Bonelli
Erede Pappalardo Studio Legale and established ARBLIT in October 2013, they have been

PCA Case No. 2014-22
Award
Page 15 of 195

serving as counsel for the Claimant throughout the proceedings.

The Respondent initially designated Professor Zachary Douglas (Matrix Chambers), Mr. David
W. Alexander (Squire Sanders (US) LLP, Columbus), Mr. Stephen P. Anway (Squire Sanders
(US) LLP, New York) and Ms. Karolina Horaékova (Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, Prague) as
its counsel. At a later stage of the proceedings, Professor Zachary Douglas withdrew from the
representation, and Mr. David W. Alexander and Mr. Stephen P. Anway were replaced by
Mr. Paolo Di Rosa (Arnold & Porter LLP, Washington DC) and Mr. Dimitri Evseev (Arnold &
Porter (UK) LLP, London) (see paragraphs 59 and 61). Ms. Horakova’s law firm changed its

business name to Skils s.r.o. advokatni kancelaf.

On 10 June 2013, the Respondent replied to the Claimant, noting that they understood the Notice
of Arbitration to be an invitation to consent to the consolidation of the claims. The Respondent
proceeded to split the proceedings into six different arbitrations, and appointed Judge Peter
Tomka, Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC, and Mr. Toby Landau QC as its party-nominated

arbitrators.

On 24 June 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent stating that this was a multi-party

arbitration and not a case of consolidation.

On 27 June 2013, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant, challenging this classification, stating
that there is “no single arbitration agreement in existence that is capable of extending to all the

different claims based upon different treaty obligations in different international instruments.”

On 5 July 2013, the Claimant requested the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (the “PCA” or “Registry”) to designate an appointing authority (“AA”) pursuant to
Article 6(2) of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules as
revised in 2010, to complete the constitution of a single arbitral tribunal and to proceed to take a

decision on the competence of the tribunal, in light of the lack of agreement between the Parties.

On 9 July 2013, by a letter to the PCA Secretary-General, the Respondent challenged the
Claimant’s request to designate an AA, alleging that in the present case, no power had been
conferred on the Secretary-General under the Rules to make arbitral appointments. The
Respondent further argued that the Notice of Arbitration was invalid, because it invoked the 2010
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules instead of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The
Respondent stressed that “there is no single arbitration agreement in existence that could possibly
give a single arbitral tribunal authority over all the 10 claimants, their alleged investments, and

their claims under the distinct international instruments.”

Page 16 of 195

By the Respondent’s letter of 9 July 2013 and the Claimant’s letter of 22 July 2013, the Parties

agreed that the present arbitration shall be governed by the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”).

On 13 August 2013, the Secretary-General declined to act upon the Claimant’s request, owing to
the lack of a basis under the UNCITRAL Rules justifying the Secretary-General’s intervention.
This was because first, appointing authorities had been agreed in advance in some of the
instruments invoked by the Claimant, and secondly, because the Respondent had actively
participated in the proceedings and responded to the Notice of Arbitration in a timely manner by

appointing the second arbitrator.

CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

On 8 May 2013, the Claimant appointed Mr. Raymond Doak Bishop as the first arbitrator.
On 10 June 2013, the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby Landau QC as the second arbitrator.

On 17 March 2014, the co-arbitrators appointed Professor Hans van Houtte as the President of

the Tribunal, thereby duly constituting the Tribunal.

On 1 August 2014, having learned that his firm had been recently engaged in other matters that
potentially involved issues similar to those in this arbitration, and citing grounds of a perception

of bias, Mr. Doak Bishop tendered his resignation from the Tribunal.

On 5 August 2014, the Claimant was requested to appoint a new arbitrator to replace Mr. Bishop
as a Tribunal member, pursuant to Articles 7(1) and 13(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal

the ings until the i of a new c

On 24 September 2014, the Claimant appointed Mr. Gary Born as its party-nominated arbitrator.

COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND PLACE OF ARBITRATION

On 22 April 2014, the Claimant submitted its individual Notice of Arbitration to the Respondent.
This date is deemed as the formal date for the commencement of the present proceedings pursuant
to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant proposed
Geneva, Switzerland as the legal seat of the present arbitration, but indicated that it would also
accept Paris, France as the legal seat of arbitration in the event that the Tribunal selected a seat

of arbitration within the European Union.

On 23 May 2014, the Respondent submitted a Response to Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration
by which it raised its objections to jurisdiction, and set out its version of the factual background

to the dispute. In addition, the Respondent proposed Paris, France as the legal seat of the present

arbitration.

On 15 July 2014, by Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal established that the place of

arbitration would be Paris, France.

On 20 October 2014, the Claimant submitted its Motion to Transfer the Seat of Arbitration,
from Paris to Geneva, citing the request of the European Commission for leave to intervene, as
well as actions taken by it and EU courts in other unrelated arbitrations as presenting grounds for

transferring the seat of arbitration to a non-EU country.

On 12 November 2014, the Respondent submitted its objections to the Claimant’s Motion to

Transfer the Seat of Arbitration, raising the absence of reasons compelling a change of the seat.

On 27 February 2015, in its Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal ordered that the place of

arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION INTERVENTION, AND CONFIDENTIALITY

On 11 July 2014, the European Commission (the “EC”) submitted an Application for Leave to

Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party.

On 15 July 2014, in its Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal, with the agreement of the Parties,
appointed the Permanent Court of Arbitration as the administering authority in the proceedings.

By the same order, the Tribunal set out the procedural timetable applicable to the proceedings.
Procedural Order No. 1 ined the following provision on conf

“Either Party may publicly disclose submissions made in these proceedings unless there
has been a decision by the Tribunal to the contrary. Requests for confidential treatment
of any item communicated in these proceedings may be submitted by either Party to the
Tribunal for a decision, in which case no item which is the subject of such request may
be publicly disclosed unless and until the Tribunal has decided upon such application.”

On 17 July 2014, the Claimant submitted its comments on Procedural Order No. 1, including an
objection to the confidentiality provisions, on the grounds that “the issue of confidentiality ha[d]
not been discussed or agreed upon by the Parties”, nor had there been any agreement on the
applicability of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State
Arbitrations. The Claimant also raised the point regarding the choice of seat of arbitration in a
European country, highlighting that the Respondent had waived the “Intra-European Union BIT
objection”, and stating that the Commission’s objection on this ground raised “serious doubts as

to the transparency of the Respondent’s behaviour.”

On 30 July 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to address by 8 August 2014 the Claimant’s

letter of 17 July 2014, asking it to “specifically elaborate[e] on the possible inconsistency with
confidentiality obligations in related matters and on its possible public law obligations of
transparency that may be applicable.” The Tribunal also invited the Claimant to submit its
response, by 18 August 2014, to the Respondent’s submission and to the Respondent’s letter of
29 July 2014. The Tribunal stressed that confidentiality should be maintained until the Tribunal

decided on the matter.

On 8 August 2014, the Respondent stated that due to the suspension of proceedings by virtue of
Mr. Doak Bishop’s resignation from the Tribunal, it would submit its response to the Claimant’s

letter of 17 July 2014, as soon as the proceedings were reinstituted.

On 11 August 2014, the President of the Tribunal advised that the Respondent’s response should

be submitted within one week of the appointment of the new arbitrator.

On 26 September 2014, following the appointment of Mr. Gary Born as the Claimant-appointed
arbitrator, the Tribunal notified the Parties of the resumption of proceedings, and set the new date

for submissions on the request from the EC for Leave to Intervene as 3 October 2014.

On 3 October 2014, the Respondent provided its response to the Claimant’s letter of 17 July
2014.

On 7 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its comments on the EC’s
Application for Leave to Intervene by 20 October 2014. The Tribunal also ordered that the
“Simultaneous Cross-Requests for Production of Documents”, which were originally due by 20

August 2014, would now be due by 27 October 2014.
On 20 October 2014, the Claimant submitted its Comments on the EC's Intervention.

By Procedural Order No. 2, dated 27 February 2015, and pursuant to Article 15(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal (with a Concurring Opinion from Mr. Gary Born) granted the
EC leave to intervene as amicus curiae, subject to the condition that the Commission undertake,
prior to consideration of its submissions, to pay in full the reasonable costs of all Parties resulting

from the submissions.

On 6 March 2015, the Registry communicated Mr. Gary Born’s Concurring Opinion to the
Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2. Mr. Gary Born expressed serious reservations, stating that it
is “exceedingly difficult [...] fairly to conclude that the Tribunal has the authority, over one
party’s objections, to permit a non-party to participate in the arbitral process.” However, he added
that bearing in mind the interest of consistency and predictability in arbitral decisions, he was

persuaded to grant the EC leave to intervene, subject to appropriate conditions.

On 8 April 2015, the EC submitted a Written Amicus Curiae Submission.

On 8 April 2015, the EC also submitted an application to vary Procedural Order No. 2, to

reconsider the condition concerning the undertakings on costs.

On 9 April 2015, the Tribunal dismissed the EC’s application to vary Procedural Order No. 2.
The Commission was granted a further opportunity to make the required undertaking on costs by
Wednesday, 15 April 2015, and notified that, if the required undertaking was not provided by

that date, the EC’s amicus curiae submission would be disallowed.

On 14 April 2015, the EC stated that it was not in a position to provide the undertaking as required

by the Tribunal. Accordingly, its amicus curiae submissions were disallowed.

DISCLOSURE BETWEEN TRIBUNALS

On 8 December 2014, the Tribunal enquired whether the Parties would be willing to accept that
the Tribunal should be informed of rulings made in the parallel proceedings involving the
Respondent (PCA Case Nos. 2013-35 and 2014-1), on issues which also arise in one or more of

the four proceedings before the Tribunal.

On 10 December 2014, the Respondent responded to the Tribunal’s enquiry, stating that, subject
to appropriate undertakings from the Tribunal, it would be prepared to agree to the Tribunal’s

suggestion.

On 12 December 2014, the Claimant expressed its agreement that the Tribunal may have access
to the decisions in the parallel proceedings. The Claimant added that a simple agreement of the

Parties was sufficient in the circumstances, and that no further agreements were required.

On 17 December 2014, the Respondent proposed that the Parties in the present proceedings, as
well as the nine other claimants in the parallel cases, sign a written agreement “regulating the
process of disclosure of the Rulings and the scope of waiver of confidentiality in the other

proceedings”.
On 27 December 2014, the Claimant sent a draft proposal for a Disclosure Agreement in the
parallel proceedings, to the Respondent.

On 6 January 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant’s proposal.

On 15 January 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of the Parties’ agreed procedures for
disclosure regarding the Rulings in PCA Cases Nos. 2013-35, 2014-1, 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-

21 and 2014-22, contained in the Disclosure Agreement.

On 27 March 2015, the Parties jointly proposed an amended procedural calendar to the Tribunal,

which was approved by the Tribunal on 30 March 2015.

DOCUMENT PRODUCTION REQUESTS
On 5 May 2015, the Claimant submitted its Request for Document Production, and related
documents. It additionally addressed earlier requests for documents that had been opposed by the

Respondent, and asked the Tribunal to decide on the Claimant’s requests.

On the same date, the Resp i its Application R ding Document P1

and related documents.

On 19 May 2015, by Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal issued rulings with respect to each
contested document request. The Tribunal reserved the right to review and change any of its
decisions concerning the Parties’ present requests at a later stage of the proceedings, if it

considered that the documents concerned were relevant and material to its determinations.

On 12 June 2015, the Parties agreed to a revision of the procedural calendar, and submitted it to

the Tribunal.

On 29 June 2015, the Claimant submitted its Memorial (including Response on Jurisdiction)

(the “Memorial”) and accompanying documents.’

withdrawn as counsel from the proceedings.

On 17 July 2015, the Respondent submitted its Application for Leave to Make Further Targeted

Requests for Production of Documents (“Respondent’s Targeted Request”).

By letter dated 17 July 2015, which was received on 18 July 2015, the Respondent notified the
Tribunal of its change of lead counsel, appointing Paolo Di Rosa (Arnold & Porter LLP,

Memorial on 9 October instead of 7 October 2015.

On 9 October 2015, pursuant to the procedural calendar, the Respondent submitted its Counter-

Memorial and accompanying documents.”

On 15 October 2015, the President acknowledged receipt of the Respondent’s submission, and
made a disclosure relating to Ms. Bridey McAsey, a member of the Respondent's counsel team.
The President suggested the removal of Ms. McAsey from the Respondent’s legal team in order

to confirm the independence of the Tribunal.

On 16 October 2015, Counsel for the Respondent confirmed that Ms. McAsey had been removed

from the Respondent’s legal team for the present proceedings.
On 2 November 2015, the Parties communicated a revised procedural calendar to the Tribunal.

On 25 November 2015, the Claimant submitted its further document requests in the form of a
completed Redfern Schedule, and sought a decision from the Tribunal on the disputed requests

raised by the Respondent’s objections of 4 November 2015.

On 2 December 2015, the Claimant submitted an “unsolicited submission”, in order to draw the
Tribunal’s attention to Price Decision No. 5/2015 of the Czech Energy Regulatory Authority,

stating that this decision “has direct and fundamental consequences for the cases before this

 

Arbitral Tribunal in terms of cause of action, jurisdiction, damages and relief sought”.

Accordingly, the Claimant sought an extension to the dates for filing of submissions.

On 3 December 2015, by Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal issued its decision on the
Claimant’s further targeted requests for the production of documents. The Tribunal set out its
tulings with respect to each contested request in the “Tribunal’s Comments” column of the

Redfern Schedule, attached as Annex I to Procedural Order No. 4.

Page 22 of 195

On 8 December 2015, the Respondent challenged the Claimant’s submission of 2 December
2015, alleging that the submission was “calculated to prejudice the Tribunal against Respondent’s

position on document disclosure issues”.

On 9 December 2015, the Respondent submitted documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4.
It also asked the Tribunal to confirm the Claimant’s obligations to maintain the confidentiality of

the documents and “not disclose them publicly or to parties in other proceedings.”

On 10 December 2015, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Parties’ agreements to vary
the existing procedural calendar which would inevitably affect the agreed hearing date, and

requested the Tribunal to indicate its availability for new hearing dates.

On the same date, the Claimant i its with the Respondent that

received in the course of the parallel arbitrations were strictly confidential and must not be
publicly disclosed, but made the point that “both Parties must be in the position to use specific
documents obtained in these arbitration proceedings also in the parallel cases, if they are relevant

and material to the outcome of those cases.”

On 15 December 2015, the Tribunal stressed that documents submitted in the present
proceedings:
“cannot be disclosed publicly and can neither be referred to and/or be submitted in
proceedings other than the [present] four arbitration proceedings [...] unless such
reference and/or submission is authorized by the proper authorities in those other

proceedings, by the law or by common agreement of the Parties involved in those other
proceedings.”

On 17 December 2015, the Tribunal set the new dates for the hearing as 26 February 2017 to 5
March 2017.
FURTHER SUBMISSION BY THE PARTIES.

On 30 December 2015, the Parties jointly agreed on a postponement of the deadline for the

submi:

By letter dated 11 November 2016, the Claimant applied to the Tribunal for leave to submit a
rejoinder on jurisdiction and a supplemental report on quantum. By letter dated 18 November
2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant’s Application, arguing that it

should be denied, except for limited supplemental jurisdictional submissions.

By Procedural Order No. 5, circulated on 29 November 2016, the Tribunal issued its decision

PosT-HEARING PROCEEDINGS

By separate e-mails dated 6 March 2017, pursuant to the Tribunal’s authorization at the hearing,*

the Respondent submitted two further exhibits into the factual record of the present proceedings

as R-427 and R-428.

By e-mails dated 7 June 2017, the Parties requested “a one-week extension of time to provide

   

submissions on costs”. The President granted the extension by e-mail of the same date.

On 16 June 2017, the Claimant submitted the Claimant’s Submission on Costs (the “Claimant’s
Submission on Costs”) to the Registry. On the same date, the Respondent filed its Cost

Submission (the “Respondent’s Cost Submission”) with the Registry. On 17 June 2017, by

 

agreement of the Parties, the Registry circulated the Parties’ respective cost submissions to the

  

other side and to the Tribunal.

By e-mail of 9 November 2017, the Respondent inquired whether the Tribunal had already
completed its deliberations on the key issues before it, indicating that it might apply for the
introduction of recent arbitral awards on subjects related to those currently pending before this

Tribunal.

On 14 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had “reached an advanced stage
in its deliberations on key issues [...] and therefore considers that there is no need for a

supplemental briefing.”

By e-mail dated 5 December 2017, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confirm “whether exhibit
C-26 is a reproduction of the official publication of the Act on Promotion in the Czech Official

State Journal” or, alternatively, to submit the official publication of the Act on Promotion to the

Hearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 70:21 to 71:23 and Hearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 75:18 to 76:12.

Tribunal.

By separate e-mails of 15 December 2017, each Party confirmed that exhibit C-26 is a verbatim

reproduction of the Act on Promotion as published in the Czech Official State Journal.

By letter dated 13 March 2018, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to admit into the record
of the present arbitration, and invite comments on, the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the
Court of Justice of the European Union in the matter of Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV dated
6 March 2018 (the “Achmea judgment”).

Upon the Tribunal’s invitation, by letter dated 23 March 2018, the Claimant provided its

comments, opposing the Respondent’s aforementioned requests.

Following a further round of comments received from the Respondent on 6 April 2018 and from
the Claimant on 13 April 2018, the Tribunal decided on 18 April 2018 to grant the Respondent’s
requests and invite further submissions from the Parties on the impact of the Achmea judgment
on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In particular, the Tribunal invited submissions from the Parties on

the following issues:

1. Whether the Achmea judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that
was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the
present proceedings;

2. Whether and how the Achmea judgment applies in arbitrations where the arbitral
seat is outside of the EU, including in particular the impact, if any, of Article 344
TFEU on the validity of an intra-EU BIT jurisdiction clause for an arbitral tribunal
sitting outside of the EU;

3. Whether and how the Achmea judgment applies to the Energy Charter Treaty;

4. Whether and how the Achmea judgment actually impacts upon the jurisdiction of an
arbitral tribunal sitting outside of the EU, as distinct from the enforceability of
awards within the EU;

5. How the Achmea judgment fits in, if at all, with Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties;

6. The relevance of Articles 27 and 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
for the present arbitrations;

7. How Swiss courts and Swiss scholarship have considered the position of EU law in
a legal universe consisting of international law and domestic law;

8. The impact, if any, of Article 177(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private
International Law; and

9. The role of waiver / estoppel, including in light of Article 186(2) of the Swiss Federal
Code on Private International Law, in this context.”

Following three extensions of the deadline requested by the Parties by e-mails dated 20 April
2018, 10 May 2018, and 8 June 2018, all of which were granted by the Tribunal, on 14 May 2018

and 9 June 2018 respectively, each Party submitted its comments on the impact of the Achmea
judgment on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction (the “Respondent’s Comments on Achmea” and

“Claimant’s Comments on Achmea”), accompanied by legal authorities.'°
By letter to the Parties dated 24 June 2018, Mr. Born stated as follows:

Iam writing to inform you that, due to recent, unforeseen developments in another
proceeding, I have concluded that it is prudent for me to resign as co-arbitrator in the
captioned matters. Regrettably, obligations of confidentiality prevent me from providing
further details.

By letter dated 25 June 2018, the PCA, under instructions of the Presiding Arbitrator, invited the
Parties to provide their comments on Mr. Born’s letter of 24 June 2018, “tak[ing] into account
Swiss law as the law of the seat of the arbitration, with reference to the treatiese of Bernhard
Berger & Franz Kellerhals, International and Domestic Arbitration in Switzerland, 3 edition
2015, pp. 331-335.

On 9 July 2018, each Party provided its comments on Mr. Born’s letter.

By letter of 11 July 2018, the Presiding Arbitrator and Mr. Landau sent a letter to the Parties,
stating as follows:
Given the advanced stage that these proceedings have already reached, the Parties are
invited to provide, by Wednesday, 18 July 2018, their comments on the possibility that
the Presiding Arbitrator and Mr. Landau complete these arbitrations as a two-person
tribunal, assuming that they are able to agree on all matters in dispute, it being understood

that, failing agreement on any matter in dispute, the Presiding Arbitrator and Mr. Landau
would invite the Claimants to make a substitute appointment.

On 18 July 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it wished to proceed with the

appointment of a substitute arbitrator.

By letter dated 20 August 2018, pursuant to Articles 13(1) and 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules,
the Claimant appointed Mr. John Beechey, CBE as its party-appointed arbitrator.

At the request of the Chairman, on 21 August 2018, the Registry circulated Mr. Beechey’s
Declaration of Acceptance and Statement of Impartiality and Independence, together with his

disclosure pursuant to Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

By letter of 28 August 2018, the Respondent expressed concerns pertaining to Mr. Beechey’s

appointment and requested Mr. Beechey’s resignation in the present matter.

By e-mail dated 3 September 2018, Mr. Beechey advised the Parties that he would “leave it to

the appointing authority to consider the matter on its merits.”

On 4 September 2018, the Respondent submitted its Notice of Challenge of Mr. Beechey in
accordance with Articles 11(1) and 11(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

By e-mail dated 19 September 2018, the Claimant advised the Tribunal that it did not agree to
the challenge of Mr. Beechey, and that the Parties had agreed that the challenge be decided by

the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

On 26 October 2018, the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce dismissed

the challenge to Mr. Beechey.

By letter dated 8 November 2018, the Claimant inter alia requested the Tribunal “to inform the
Parties on the next steps” of the arbitration and sought leave to submit brief supplemental costs
submissions. On the same date, the Tribunal provided an update on the status of its deliberations

to the Parties.

On 16 November 2018 the Respondent requested the Tribunal “to allow the Parties to provide
supplementary briefing on recently issued and highly relevant arbitral awards”, to schedule a
“brief oral hearing, to permit counsel to address issues arising out of the Achmea Judgment”, and

commented on the Claimant’s request for updated costs submissions.

By letter of 19 November 2018, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s request for a briefing on
recently issued awards, citing the advanced stage of its deliberations. By the same letter, the

STATEMENT OF FACTS

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE INCENTIVE REGIME FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
(“RES REGIME”)

In 1992, the Czech Republic adopted Act No. 586/1992 on Income Tax (“Act on Income Tax”),
which, according to the Claimant, was the first legislative step encouraging the use of renewable
energy sources (“RES”), including photovoltaic plants. Through the Act on Income Tax, the
Czech Republic implemented two relevant tax incentives. The first exempted RES producers
from corporate income tax for the year in which the respective solar facility was put into operation
and the following five calendar years (“Tax Holiday”).'° The second incentive introduced an
accelerated depreciation period for tax purposes for certain components of, inter alia,

photovoltaic installations. '7

In December 1995, the EC (then called “the Commission of the European Communities”)
published a white paper on the “Energy Policy for the European Union”, which aimed at
encouraging the promotion of RES through tax benefits and other measures.'* In November 1997,
the EC published another white paper entitled “Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of
Energy” stating that “[a] long-term stable framework for the development of renewable sources
of energy, covering political, legislative, administrative, economic and marketing aspects is in

fact the top priority for the economic operators involved in their development.””

On 27 September 2001, following the publication of the two white papers, the European
Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2001/77/EC on the
promotion of electricity produced by RES in the internal electricity market (“2001 Directive”),
aiming “to promote an increase in the contribution of [RES] to electricity production in the
internal market for electricity and to create a basis for a future Community framework thereof.””?
In light of this objective, EU Member States were required to “take appropriate steps to encourage

greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in conformity with

Article 19(1)(d), Act No. 586/192 (Ex. C-18/R-1). The English translations of the original sources in

Czech submitted by the Parties differ. Where they differ, the Tribunal quoted from the English translation
that is the most clear and comprehensive.

[...] national indicative targets”*' and to “adopt and publish a report setting national indicative
targets for future consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in terms of
percentage of electricity consumption for the next ten years.””* The 2001 Directive also obliged
Member States to “outline the measures taken or planned, at the national level, to achieve these
national indicative targets” and to publish their success in meeting the targets.’ The Annex to
the 2001 Directive set out “[r]eference values for Member States’ national indicative targets for
the contribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources to gross electricity

consumption by 2010.”4

In late 2003, the Czech Republic prepared draft legislation that was aimed at increasing the
support provided to RES producers.”> An explanatory report on the draft legislation was dated 12
November 2003 (“Explanatory Report”).”° The draft legislation was eventually adopted in
March 2005 as Act No. 180/2005 Coll. (“Act on Promotion”). While not yet an EU Member
State, the Czech Republic was already under an obligation to comply with EU law, including
tules on State aid. On 16 December 2003, the Czech Society for Wind Energy and the Czech
national section of the European Association for Renewable Energy (“EUROSOLAR”) filed a
complaint with the EC in respect of the 2003 draft of the Act on Promotion in view of its alleged

incompatibility with EU State aid law.?”

On 27 July 2004, having examined the complaint, the EC informed EUROSOLAR that the 2003
draft of the Act on Promotion, as it then was, “does not fall under the definition of State aid within
the meaning of Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty”.”* The last paragraph of the letter read: “Should
you learn of any new particulars that might demonstrate the existence of an infringement of the

39 29

State aid rules, I would be grateful if you would inform my department as soon as possible’

Upon its accession to the EU, on 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic assumed all obligations

deriving from EU legal instruments, including the 2001 Directive. In particular, Annex II —
Energy, Part A of the 2003 EU Accession Treaty set the Czech Republic’s national target for the
contribution of electricity produced from RES to the gross electricity consumption by 2010 at
8% (“Indicative 2010 Target”).°

On 31 March 2005, the Czech Republic adopted the Act on Promotion, which entered into force

on | August 2005.7! Section 1(2) of the Act on Promotion defined its objectives as follows:

Section 1
Subject Matter of Regulation

(2) The aim of this Act is to, in the interest of climate protection and environmental
protection,

a) promote the exploitation of renewable energy sources (“Renewable Sources”),

b) ensure that the share of Renewable Sources in the consumption of primary energy
sources continually increases,
contribute to conservation in the exploitation of natural resources and to the
sustainable development of society,
put in place the conditions for achieving the indicative target so that the share of
electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity
consumption in the Czech Republic in 2010 and to put in place the conditions for
further increasing such share after 2010.

d@

The Act on Promotion introduced new incentives for RES producers through a combination of

tariff and non-tariff i including: (1) p i of RES prod in the

 

distribution or transmission of electricity, (2) fixed purchase prices or Feed-in-Tariffs (“FiT”)
and, alternatively, (3) Green Bonuses (“Green Bonuses”, and together with the FiT, “Subsidies”

or “Tariffs”).*?

 

The preferential treatment of RES producers in the distribution or transn

  

ission of electricity
enshrined in Section 4 of the Act on Promotion, provided, inter alia, for the obligation of the
transmission grid operator and distribution system operators “to connect the facilities [...] to the

ion or

 

transmission grid or distribution systems on a priority basis for the purpose of transmi!

distribution of electricity from [RES]”, if a RES producer requests them to do so.*?

The FiT system obliged grid operators to purchase all electricity produced from RES on a priority
basis and at a price annually determined by the Czech Energy Regulatory Office (“ERO”). The

Green Bonus system, which was the one selected by the Claimant, entitled RES producers to sell
electricity to third parties at a market price and granted them a financial bonus paid by the grid

operator for each kilowatt-hour produced and sold.**

These tariff incentives were established by Section 6 of the Act on Promotion, which reads:

Section 6
Amounts of Prices for Electricity from Renewable Sources and
Amounts of Green Bonuses

(1) The Office sets, one calendar year in advance, the purchasing prices for electricity from
Renewable Sources (the “Purchasing Prices”), separately for individual kinds of Renewable
Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that

a) the conditions are created for the achievement of the indicative target so that the share
of electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity
consumption in 2010 and

b) for facilities commissioned

1. after the effective date of this Act, there is attained, with the Support consisting of
the Purchasing Prices, a fifteen year payback period on capital expenditures,
provided technical and economic parameters are met, such parameters consisting of,
in particular, cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation efficiency of the
primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the
facility, such parameters being stipulated in an implementing legal regulation,

2. after the effective date of this Act, the amount of revenues per unit of electricity
from Renewable Sources, assuming Support in the form of Purchasing Prices, is
maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues], for a period of 15 years from the
commissioning year of the facility, taking into account the industrial producer price
index; the commissioning of a facility is also deemed to include cases involving the
completion of a rebuild of the technological part of existing equipment, a change of
fuel, or the completion of modernization that raises the technical and ecological
standard of an existing facility,

3. prior to the effective date of this Act, there is maintained for a period of 15 years the
minimum amount of Purchasing Prices set for the year 2005 in accordance with the
legal regulations to date and taking into account the industrial producer price index.

(2) When setting the amounts of green bonuses, the Office also takes into account a heightened

degree of risk associated with off-taking electricity from Renewable Sources in the

electricity market.

When setting Purchasing Prices and green bonuses, the Office proceeds on the basis of

differing costs for the acquisition, connection and operation of individual types of facilities,

including the development thereof [the development of such costs] over time.

Purchasing Prices set by the Office for the following calendar year shall not be less than

95% of the Purchasing Prices in effect in the year for which the setting decision is made.

The provision of the first sentence shall not be used for setting the Purchasing Prices for the

following calendar year for those types of Renewable Sources where the payback period on

capital expenditures is shorter than 11 years in the calendar year in which the Office decides
on the setting of the new Purchase Prices; When setting Purchase Prices, the Office

proceeds in accordance with subsections 1 through 3.

recover their investment in RES plants within 15 years, provided that the installations met certain
“technical and economic parameters”, including “cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation
efficiency of the primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the
facility.” Article 6 of the Act on Promotion also introduced two restrictions on the ability of the
ERO to change the tariffs. First, Article 6(1)(b)(2) provided that the established FiT would remain
the same for a period of 15 years subject to the industrial producer price index. Second, under
Article 6(4) of the Act on Promotion, the FiT set by the ERO in any given year was not allowed
to be decreased by more than 5% of the value of the FiT in the previous year (“5% rule”). With
regard to Green Bonuses, Article 4(3) stipulated that RES producers were allowed to switch

freely from Green Bonuses to FiT and vice versa.*”

In the same year in which the Act on Promotion entered into force, various governmental officials
and entities of the Czech Republic promoted the Incentive Regime for RES producers and
emphasised the importance of the guaranteed electricity purchase price on several occasions.**
In particular, Mr. Martin Bursik, one of the co-authors of the Act on Promotion, who became
Minister of Environment from 2007 to 2009, stated in his article dated 1 June 2005 that the most
important principle of the Act on Promotion was “the guarantee of a stable feed-in tariff for a 15-

year period following the launch of the power station into operation.”?

According to Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, the indicative technical and economic
parameters for the fixing of the FiT were to be established by implementing regulations issued

by the ERO.

By Regulation No. 475/2005 Coll. (“Technical Regulation”) dated 30 November 2005 and
amended in 2007 and 2009, the ERO set out the general technical and economic parameters in

order for newly installed plants to achieve the 15-year payback period provided by Article

6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion.” Section 4 of the Technical Regulation stated that:

In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured through the support by Purchase Prices
[FiT] of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and economic parameters of
an installation producing electricity from renewable sources must be satisfied, where the
producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve, with the given level of
Purchasing Prices

a) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the
installation, such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), and

b) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the
installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero."
In 2007 and until the end of 2010, ERO set the weighted average cost of capital (““WACC”) level
used to calculate the FiT at 7%. It moreover applied the maximum 5% annual Tariffs reduction
required by Section 6(4) of the Act on Promotion.*’ Furthermore, it amended the Technical
Regulation in 2007, confirmed in 2009, to fix the estimated lifetime of new photovoltaic plants
at 20 years.* The period during which the FiT would apply was correspondingly extended from

15 to 20 years.*°

In 2009, the ERO issued Regulation No. 140/2009 Coll. (“Pricing Regulation”), Article 2(9) of

which provided for an annual increase of the FiT:

Feed-in tariffs and Green bonuses stipulated by the Act on Promotion are applied
throughout the estimated lifetime of plants determined by the regulation implementing
some provisions of the Act on Promotion. The Feed-in tariffs increase annually
throughout the lifetime of the plant classified in the respective category depending on the
type of the renewable resource used and the date of launch into operation with respect to
the industrial producers’ price index by a minimum of 2% and maximum of 4%, with the
exception of biomass and bio gas burning plants.*6

The above regulation thus established that payment of the FiT and Green Bonuses was guaranteed
throughout the estimated lifetime of photovoltaic power plants and the FiT was to increase
annually by a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 4% “taking into account the inflation price

index for industrial producers over the lifetime of the plant.”

According to the Claimant, the Act on Promotion, the relevant ERO regulations and the Act on
Income Tax jointly established the incentive regime, which offered investments in the
photovoltaic sector the FiT or alternatively Green Bonuses, the Income Tax Exemption and the
Shortened Depreciation Period (the “Incentive Regime”).’* The Respondent has a different
understanding, namely that the regime provided by the Czech Republic was not photovoltaic-
focused. According to this view, while the Act on Promotion and the relevant ERO regulations
provided an incentive scheme as to the entire RES by granting either the FiT or the Green
Bonuses, the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period did not constitute

part of it.

In late 2008, as explained by the Claimant, the Czech solar energy sector became particularly

attractive for foreign investors, due to the decrease in prices of photovoltaic components. ”

According to the Claimant, the ERO was still promoting the Incentive Regime in 2009.
One of the Claimant’s employees attended a presentation delivered by Mr. Rostislav Krejcar on
18 September 2009 in Znojmo. The conclusions of that conference were made available to
Mr. Pavel Koutny.*” According to Mr. Koutny, slide 44 of the relevant presentation “clearly
stresses that FiT and Green Bonuses apply over the expected lifetime of solar plants, set by the
ERO itself in 20 years”.*!

The licensing process to build and operate the solar power plants comprised the following steps:

a

application to a regional grid operator for connection to the grid;

b

issuance by the grid operator of a binding statement contained in a preliminary
contract, confirming that the grid could sustain a given electricity input and that
a grid connection agreement would be concluded within 180 days;

c

entry into a grid connection agreement with the grid operator;

d

application to the ERO for the energy production license; and

e

entry into a power purchase agreement with the grid operator.

The Claimant’s solar plant was finished and the licensing process completed in October 2010.
Subsequently, the SPV obtained the energy license and concluded the Agreement on the Payment

AMENDMENTS TO THE RES REGIME THAT RESULTED IN THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE
CLAIMANT’S RIGHTS UNDER THE BIT AND/OR THE ECT

The events described below unfolded in the following political context in the Czech Republic. In
March 2009, the government of the then-incumbent Prime Minister Mr. Mirek Topolanek
resigned after a vote of no confidence. In May 2009, a temporary government lead by the new
Prime Minister Jan Fischer was sworn in." This temporary government was in power for more
than a year. During that period, it undertook not to “open any politically contentious, polarising
issues during its term in office” and not to “submit to the Chamber of Deputies any politically or
ideologically polarising legislative proposals”. Only in July 2010 was the new government
finally formed, following the elections that were scheduled for October 2009, but were postponed

by the Czech Constitutional Court until May 2010.

In June 2009, while the temporary government was still in power, the Czech media reported about
“the ongoing solar boom” in the Czech solar energy sector and quoted Mr. Josef Fiit, the then
head of the ERO, according to whom “[t]he solar electricity feed-in tariff has gone in some
instances economically beyond the limit as the distributors are forced to enhance power lines,
which makes electricity more expensive for consumers.” Therefore, as further reported by the
Czech media, the ERO was “seeking ways to reduce the solar energy feed-in tariff
dramatically.””° However, as reported, under the existing laws, the ERO was not allowed to
“lower the RES electricity feed-in tariff by more than 5% per year. This is why it [was] trying to

agree an amendment to the rules with the government and members of parliament.”

On 25 June 2009, a new EU directive 2009/28/EC dated 23 April 2009 replaced the 2001
Directive with the aim of establishing a common framework for the promotion of energy from
RES (“2009 Directive”).”” The 2009 Directive fixed the Czech Republic’s new target for the
contribution of electricity produced from RES at 13% by 2020 (“2020 target”).”* Its preamble
furthermore stated that “[o]ne important means to achieve the aim of this Directive is to guarantee
the proper functioning of national support schemes, as under Directive 2001/77/EC, in order to
maintain investor confidence and allow Member States to design effective national measures for

target compliance”.”*

Between July 2008 and August 2009, the ERO sent several letters to the Ministry of Industry and
Trade regarding the situation in the Czech solar energy sector.” On 4 July 2008, Mr. Fiit sent a
letter to the Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade emphasizing that grid operators would have
to make significant investments into infrastructure in view of the increased number of requests

for connection to the grid.” By letter dated 1 July 2009, Mr. Fiit informed the Minister of

Industry and Trade that investors in the photovoltaic energy were put at “an unprecedented
advantage over investors and producers of other types of renewable resources” due to the
decreased cost of investment. ”” Mr. Fiit also stressed that the on-going growth in the photovoltaic
sector “leads to a speculative block of connection capacities at the level of the distribution
systems” and ultimately would result in a significant financial burden on Czech customers. * In
view of these considerations, Mr. Fiit proposed to repeal the 5% rule so that the ERO would be
allowed to adjust the FiT.” By letter dated 10 August 2009, Mr. Blahoslav Némeéek, vice-
chairman and director of the regulatory section of the ERO, informed Mr. Roman PortuzZak,
acting director of the electric power department at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, that Mr.
Fiit “had already approached the minister of industry and trade [...] and [...] received a positive
response expressing readiness of the MIT to cooperate” on the amendments to the Act on

Promotion.”

On 24 August 2009, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a press release communicating its
intention to abolish the 5% rule starting from 1 January 2010 since “the grant policy from the
part of the state [in the photovoltaic sector] has ceased to fulfil its primary function, because
support for solar power stations has shifted from an area of necessary state support for its
existence to the position of a branch where profit is guaranteed regardless of the situation on the
market.”*!

On 28 August 2009, Mr. Portuzak (MIT) sent to Mr. Némeéek (ERO) a letter acknowledging the
“huge” growth in the solar energy sector and the future unsustainability of the existing regulatory
regime. © At the same time, Mr. Portuz4k noted “the goal of section 6(4) [of the Act on
Promotion] was to ensure the investors in renewable sources certainty of payback of their

suits filed by investors against the Czech Republic on grounds of lost investment.”*? Mr. Portuzak
further stated that the MIT “is preparing the implementation of the 2009 Directive into the Czech
legislation” meaning that amendments to the existing regulatory regime would “require longer
time” and would “exceed the time limit for ERO’s obligation to set purchasing prices for RES to

be commissioned in 2010”.

By letter dated 8 September 2009, Mr. Fiit informed Mr. Vojié, Chairman of the Economic
Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, that the 5% rule needed to be amended.** The same letter
enclosed a legislative draft enabling the ERO to disregard the 5% rule when setting the purchase
prices for 2011 and thereafter “for those types of renewable resources, for which an investment
return of less than eleven years is achieved in the year, in which a decision is made on the new
purchase prices”.*° Mr. Fiit also noted that “[iJnvestors will be able to prepare sufficiently in
advance for the change in the conditions for investing which should eliminate entirely the risk of

possible lawsuits in the Czech Republic regarding protection of investments.”*’

On 16 November 2009, the Government introduced to Parliament an explanatory report on draft
Act No. 137/2010 essentially reflecting the legislative draft and the explanations provided by Mr.
Fit to Mr. Vojit in the aforementioned letter dated 8 September 2009.**

On the same day, during the Government’s press conference, Mr. Vladimir ToSovsky (Minister
of Industry and Trade) clarified that the Incentive Regime would remain unchanged for 2010.
Mr. ToSovsky further explained that draft Act No. 137/2010 would reduce the incentive only
from 2011, because some investors had already invested in on-going projects and the change of
“the terms and conditions under which they invested in the course of the development [...] could

pose a threat to their investment.”

further reservation of capacity of the grid for future connections.”

By open letter to Parliament dated 12 March 2010, distribution companies, namely CEZ, a.s., E.
ON Czech Holding AG and PRE., a.s. urged the Chamber of Deputies to take a decision on the
proposed amendments to the Act on Promotion during its March session, noting that the RES
support “should be set fairly, to guarantee a long-term return on investment, not excessive

profits.””!

On 17 March 2010, Parliament adopted Act No. 137/2010, amending the Act on Promotion by
abolishing from | January 2011 the 5% rule “for those types of renewable resources, which, in
the year in which the new feed-in tariffs are being determined, achieve the investment return
shorter than 11 years.” According to the Claimant, this amendment concerned only those plants
that were connected to the grid after 2011. Since the level of Green Bonuses was in principle
fixed as the difference between FiT and the electricity market price, the abolition of the 5% break

tule also affected the level of Green Bonuses.™*

In July 2010, in accordance with Article 4 of the 2009 Directive, the Czech Ministry of Industry
and Trade published a “National Renewable Energy Action Plan”, providing a roadmap of how
the Czech Republic planned to attain its 2020 target for the contribution of renewable energies to
its energy consumption (“2010 Action Plan”).”> The 2010 Action Plan, inter alia, mentioned tax
exemptions as part of the incentive scheme.” It also confirmed the FiT level for plants connected
in 2010 and its 20-year duration of the guaranteed FiT.” Furthermore, the 2010 Action Plan
approved an increase in PV generation capacity for 2010 and stated that there were no caps on

Also in July 2010, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Environment of the Czech Republic
announced to the press their intentions to cope with the solar boom by altering the existing fiscal

regime.”

On 15 September 2010, the Government submitted to Parliament draft Act No. 330/2010 in
which it proposed to withdraw subsidies from all but the smallest solar installations.'°° The draft
Act provided, inter alia, that “[p]hotovoltaic power plants already connected to the electric power
system will have their right to claim support preserved under existing conditions”.'' A week
later, the Government instructed the Minister of Industry and Trade and the Minister of
Environment to create a coordination committee in order to prepare “an analysis of the impacts
of support for renewable resources on energy prices and potential proposals for resolution of the

matter”.!"?

In the course of October 2010, the Government submitted to Parliament draft legislation
amending the Act on Income Tax and the Act on Promotion to introduce a subsidy to be provided
by the Czech Republic to the grid operators.'°’ The draft legislation contained, inter alia, the
following provision: “[t]he right to receive Support for the production of electricity from sources

Act No. 165/2012 Coll., which entered into force partly upon its publication on 30 May 2012,
and partly thereafter on 1 January 2013, replaced the Act on Promotion (“New Act on
Promotion”).'”” First, the New Act on Promotion terminated all existing contracts between RES
producers and the grid operators that provided for the payment of FiT or Green Bonuses as of 31
December 2012. RES producers that intended to maintain entitlement to the FiT were compelled
to enter into new non-negotiable supply contracts with “Mandatory Purchasers” chosen by the
Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade.''? However, as Hutira SPV has selected the Green Bonus
system, the referenced provision does not apply to ICW’s investment.''* Second, Act No.
165/2012 introduced an obligation to pay the “negative electricity hourly price”, which was
designed to be paid to the Mandatory Purchasers by RES operators entitled to the FiT or to be
deducted from the payable FiT by the Mandatory Purchasers, if the price of electricity on the
daily market had a negative value, i.e., when the grid was experiencing a surplus, causing the
market price to turn negative.''> Third, Act No. 165/2012 introduced certain recycling fees for
the disposal of photovoltaic panels.'!® At the same time, the New Act on Promotion did not affect

the tariffs guaranteed to the existing installations under the Act on Promotion.'!7

On 13 September 2013, Act No. 310/2013 Coll. entered into force. This Act extended the Solar
Levy’s application after 31 December 2013 and reduced the Solar Levy to 10% for payments
received under the FiT system and to 11% for payments received under the Green Bonuses

would be introduced:

L...] a new testing mechanism. For bigger power plants, where the volume of the
promotion exceeds the amount of EUR 200,000 in 3 years, after a certain time period we

In accordance with Article 6(1) of the Act on Promotion and Article 4(7) of Act No. 165/2012
Coll., the ERO, by virtue of an annual “Price Decision”, sets the level of FiT and Green Bonuses
applicable to RES plants to be connected in the following year and the 2% to 4% yearly FiT

group of Czech senators (“Petitioners”) brought a challenge to the Czech Constitutional Court,

seeking the annulment of these measures. '**

The Petitioners asserted that these measures violated a number of Czech and international legal
norms, including the right to property, the right to engage in an enterprise and conduct a business,
the principle of the rule of law, and the principle of equality before the law.'”° With respect to the

Solar Levy, the Petitioners argued that solar investors:

received very significant assurances from state authorities that they could expect [...]
revenues from the production of energy under the framework of the regime stipulated by
such Act, and such Act did not stipulate that certain of such producers would face a levy
obligation [...] Such expectations constituted legitimate expectations.'?”

According to the Petitioners, the withdrawal of the Income Tax Provisions, constituted:

a case of arbitrariness on the part of lawmakers, since they could have opted for a vacatio
legis period long enough to give the relevant taxpayer that began their entrepreneurial
activities at any time during the period when the previously existing legal regulation was
in effect the ability to use the tax exemption on an equal footing and for the same period
of time.!8

In response to the Petitioners’ complaint, and upon invitation by the Czech Constitutional Court,
the Czech Government, including the ERO, and both houses of the Czech Parliament, made

submissions opposing the complaint.'”°

On 15 May 2012, the Czech Constitutional Court upheld the measures, finding that neither the
introduction of the Solar Levy nor the withdrawal of the Income Tax Provisions violated the
Czech Constitution as long as Czech law provided for mechanisms to mitigate any “strangling”

or “suffocating” effects.'*°

Having recapitulated the arguments put to it, the Czech Constitutional Court stated, inter alia,

that:

The Constitutional Court has not ignored the fact that it had been the state that
guaranteed, by means of a law, a fifteen-year payback period on investment and a certain
amount of revenues per unit of electricity produced from renewable sources, thereby
motivating the affected entities to undertake entrepreneurial activities in the area of
energy production from renewable sources. '*!

The Czech Constitutional Court concluded, inter alia, that:

The principle of legal certainty cannot be viewed as being identical to a requirement of

absolute unchangeability of legal regulation, since legal regulation is subject to, among

other things, social and economic changes and the requirement of ensuring that the state

budget remains stable.'?
Following the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, individual photovoltaic investors
brought proceedings against their tax administrations, alleging that, in their particular case, the
Solar Levy had a “strangling effect” on them.'*? By late 2013, several cases reached the Czech
Supreme Administrative Court as the highest Czech Court competent in taxation matters, which
denied all claims, noting, inter alia, that “[t]he Constitutional Court’s instruction to take
liquidating effects of the solar power levy into account in individual cases can only be carried
out under current legislation using the institute of tax remission pursuant” to the Tax Procedural

Code.'**

On 10 July 2014, the Czech Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the Solar Levy was “in
nature a decrease in governmental subsidy and not a tax” and therefore it did not cause double

taxation on the income of solar electricity producers.'*°

On 18 September 2014, in response to the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, the Czech
Financial Administration stated as follows:
Producers potentially affected by the individual effect of the solar levy found by the
Constitutional Court to be “strangling” have been and are able to at least mitigate, if not

fully eliminate, its impact using standard tools [e.g. tax deferral or payment in
instalments] under the Tax Administration Law.!"6

THE EC’s DECISIONS ON COMPATIBILITY OF THE RES REGIME WITH EU STATE AID LAW

On 8 January 2013, the Czech Republic notified the EC that it had passed the New Act on

Promotion (“First Notification”).'*”

On 12 June 2014, the EC issued its decision that the financial support foreseen by the New Act
on Promotion was granted directly from the State budget and, therefore, involved State aid, but

that, by virtue of an exemption, the incentives were still compatible with the internal market.'**

On 11 December 2014, the Czech Republic filed with the EC a second notification of the RES
support mechanisms in respect of RES plants commissioned before 1 January 2013 (“Second
Notification”).'° Upon this notification, the EC opened another preliminary examination into
the compatibility of the Incentive Regime with EU State aid law as it was applied between 2006
and 2012.”

On 28 November 2016, in response to the Second Notification, the EC decided as follows:

The Commission regrets that the Czech Republic put the aid measure in question into
effect in breach of Article 108(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

However, it has decided, on the basis of the foregoing assessment, not to raise objections
to the aid on the grounds that it is compatible with the internal market pursuant to
Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. '!

THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all claims brought by the

Claimant.'”

The Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims it has brought.’

The Parties’ respective arguments are set out in detail in the sections which follow.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT MADE A “FOREIGN” INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
BIT AND THE ECT

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that Articles 1(a) of the BIT and 1(6) of the ECT require the existence
of a “foreign investment”, which in turn requires economic characteristics in the form of a
contribution made from outside the host state.'* The Respondent, relying upon the decisions in
Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (Canada) v. Venezuela‘ and Standard Chartered Bank v.

Tanzania,'“°

argues that for the investment to be protected and for the Tribunal to exercise
jurisdiction, the above requirements must be satisfied, lest an abuse of process occurs, as held in

Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic.'*"

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s interest in Hutira SPV constitutes a purely domestic
investment, not protected by either the ECT or the BIT, given that it was made by a domestic
investor through a “foreign shell company”.'**

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant has no substantive ties with the United Kingdom, its
place of registration, and that the identity of its shareholders has been withheld.'”’ In this vein,

the Respondent argues that the Claimant revealed only in the Reply that Mr. Pavel Koutny, a

Czech national, was the holder of all Hutira SPV bearer shares and the sole beneficial owner of
ICW since 2005,’ and that he purchased the shares using funds denominated in Czech currency,

from a Czech bank account.'*!

In particular, the Respondent alleges that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, because ICW’s
investment is merely “disguised” as international. '*? As held by the Tribunal in KT Asia

Investment Group BV vy. Kazakhstan, a shell company’s holding does not amount to a

 

sufficient to itute an i .!3 The Respondent observes that ICW, which
serves merely as a “shell”, was incorporated in 1998 and remained dormant until Mr. Koutny
acquired its shares in 2005.'*‘ The Respondent further notes that ICW has its seat at 788-790
Finchley Road, London, United Kingdom, which serves not only as head office of the Claimant
and domicile of Mr. Koutny, but also the registered seat of more than 30,000 companies. '*> The
Respondent alleges that there is no evidence of any activity of ICW in the UK after 2005, or
indeed ever since its incorporation.'® Its only connections to the UK are its Finchley Road
address in London and its use of nominee directors. The latter, however, appear to lack decision-
making power, which rests with Mr. Koutny, as CFO and sole beneficial owner of the
company.'*’ The Respondent also points out that Mr. Koutny’s residential and service addresses

are in Prague.'**

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that its character as investor is to be determined solely by reference to the
specific requirements set out in the ECT and the BIT. For this reason, the Claimant disavows the
proposition that the object and purpose of investment treaties is to prevent tribunals from
adjudicating disputes involving claimants controlled by nationals of the host state. Hence, the

Czech nationality of the Claimant’s beneficial owner is of no consequence in the present case,

nor is the Claimant’s character as investor affected by the substance of its economic connection
with the United Kingdom. ' This conclusion is further evidenced by the Respondent’s own
stance, since, in Czech investment treaty practice, specific language is required in order to
exclude an entity lacking a substantial connection with its place of incorporation from treaty
protection. In addition, the Claimant notes that ICW serves as the investment vehicle for various
investments, which demonstrates, for the sake of completeness, that it is in fact an active

company.'®

Further, the Claimant argues that its investment falls within the broad definition of investment
set out in the ECT, understood in its ordinary meaning, and that the test applicable thereunder
differs from the standard applicable under the ICSID Convention. An “inherent meaning”
requirement, in the Claimant’s contention, lacks any basis in the text of the ECT and the UK BIT.
In this vein, the Claimant maintains that the origin of the capital, a requirement for which no
treaty foundation is provided, is irrelevant. Also, where relied upon, the inherent meaning test
has been used to decline jurisdiction in cases involving investments in the form of one-off sales
of goods, unlike the present case. In any case, even if the Tribunal were to accept the inherent
meaning theory, the Claimant has satisfied the requirements, as it made a_ financial

contribution."

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal notes the Parties’ disagreement as to whether the Claimant has made an investment
within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 1(6) of the ECT. In particular, the
Parties disagree as to whether an investment requires the contribution of funds which originate

from outside the host state.

It is recalled that the Respondent relies primarily upon the decisions in Nova Scotia'® and
Standard Chartered Bank,'® to argue that a contribution of foreign origin is required by the

inherent meaning of the term “investment”. The Claimant contests the existence and the

relevance of an inherent meaning of investment. In the alternative, it submits that it made an

investment which satisfies such an inherent conception by making an appropriate financial

contribution.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that funds must originate from outside the host state for a
contribution so funded to qualify as an “investment” under the BIT or the ECT. The Tribunal

reaches this conclusion on the basis of the text of the provisions of the BIT and the ECT.

It is accepted by all Parties that the interpretation of a treaty provision is governed by the
customary international law rules as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties. Hence the first step of the interpretive exercise, , as provided in Article 31
of the VCLT, is to consider the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty, in their context and

in the light of the treaty’s object and purpose.
Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 1(6) of the ECT provide as follows:

Article 1(a) of the BIT
For the purposes of this Agreement:

(a) the term “investment” means every kind of asset belonging to an investor of one
Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party under the law in force of
the latter Contracting Party in any sector of economic activity and in particular, though
not exclusively, includes:

(i) movable and immovable property and any other related property rights including
mortgages, liens or pledges;

(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation
in a company;

(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;
(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, know-how and technical processes;

(v) business concessions conferred by law or, where appropriate under the law of the
Contracting Party concerned, under contract, including concessions to search for,
cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as
investments within the meaning of this Agreement. The term "investment" includes all
investments, whether made before or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement;

Article 1(6) of the ECT
As used in this Treaty:
[od

(6) “Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by
an Investor and includes:

210.

PCA Case No. 2014-22
Award
Page 58 of 195

(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any
property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity
participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of
a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an
economic value and associated with an Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;
(e) Returns;

(8) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and
permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the
Energy Sector. A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect
their character as investments and the term “Investment” includes all
investments, whether existing at or made after the later of the date of entry into
force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of the Investor making the
investment and that for the Contracting Party in the Area of which the
investment is made (hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Date”) provided
that the Treaty shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the
Effective Date.

“Investment” refers to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the

Energy Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a Contracting

Party in its Area as “Charter efficiency projects” and so notified to the Secretariat.
As to Article 1(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this provision imposes a
requirement that the funds of an investment be foreign in their origin. In particular, the Tribunal
notes that paragraph (a) refers to “every kind of asset”, regardless of the origin of the funds
utilised for its acquisition. The only restriction imposed in paragraph (a) is that the asset in
question is one “belonging to an investor”. In this vein, the Tribunal considers that whether an
investment belongs to an investor is independent of the question of the origin of the funds
employed by an investor to acquire such investment. Furthermore, the nationality requirement
set out in the part of the clause following “belonging” is confined to that of the investor, and thus,
it does not support the proposition that funds must originate in either Contracting Party. These
considerations are at least in part confirmed by the final sentence in Article 1(a) of the BIT, which
emphasises that “all investments” which fall within the provision’s scope of application are

covered, regardless of the time of making of the respective investment.

Nor is the Tribunal persuaded that Article 1(6) of the ECT establishes a requirement as to the
foreign origin of the funds of an investment. In particular, the Tribunal notes that Article 1(6)
also refers to “every kind of asset”, regardless of the origin of the funds for its acquisition. The

only restriction is that the asset in question is “owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an

212.

213.

215.

PCA Case No. 2014-22

Award

Page 59 of 195

Investor”. Once again, the Tribunal considers that the question whether an investment is owned
by an investor is a matter independent of the question of origin of the funds employed by an
investor to acquire such investment. Furthermore, where the investor needs to be a national of
another Contracting Party, the ECT does not require that the funds also come from another

Contracting Party.

To sustain its arguments as to the meaning of the term “investment, the Respondent has relied
upon a number of decisions, most prominently those adopted by the Nova Scotia, Standard

Chartered Bank, Phoenix and KT Asia tribunals.

As for the decision in Nova Scotia, the Tribunal concurs with the Claimant’s observation that this
decision went essentially to the question whether the dispute concerned a sale of goods, which

could not be das an “i Pi Tits, ing therefore is not appli to the

present circumstances.

As for Standard Chartered Bank, the tribunal in that arbitration found that the use of the verb
“made” in Article I(a) of the Tanzania-UK BIT entailed an investor’s “active” role, “rather than
simple passive ownership.”!® In this regard, it suffices to note that, unlike Article I(a) of the
Tanzania-UK BIT, Article 1(6) of the ECT does not employ the verb “made” and expressly
provides for indirect control. In any case, if a requirement as to the degree of involvement of the
investor in the making of an investment were to be held applicable, such requirement does not

have any bearing upon the origin of the funds employed by the investor.

The Tribunal notes that the Phoenix tribunal considered the bona fide character of the investment
to establish whether “the Claimant engaged in an abusive attempt to get access to ICSID”.'°
Notwithstanding this fact, which renders the decision inapposite in principle, the Tribunal notes
that the Phoenix tribunal considered the timing of the claim and that, as correctly pointed out by
the Claimant, the Claimant’s incorporation took place before any dispute was foreseeable. The
situation was different for the claimant in Phoenix, which notified the dispute to the respondent
before it registered the ownership of the companies at issue in the Czech Republic. '”
Furthermore, unlike Article 1(a) of the BIT, Article 1 of the Czech Republic-Israel BIT includes

among the definition of “investment” “assets invested in connection with economic activities by

Nova Scotia, para. 113 (Ex. RLA-304).
Standard Chartered Bank, para. 232 (Ex. RLA-308).

an investor”. Thus, it follows that, in light of the timing of the Claimant’s incorporation, no abuse

of process through the commencement of the present arbitration is involved.

In relation to KT Asia, the Tribunal notes that the tribunal undertook an inquiry into the meaning
of “investment” under the ICSID Convention, which is not applicable to the present case. In
addition, the parties in that matter had not contested that the “objective definition” of investment
was applicable to both the BIT and the ICISD Convention.'® In spite of the above aspects
rendering the decision in KT Asia largely inapposite for present purposes, the Tribunal observes
that, according to this decision, a commitment of resources must be made, failing which an “asset
belonging to the claimant” is not to be deemed a protected investment. The KT Asia tribunal,
which denied jurisdiction on the sole basis of the finding that no contribution had been made,'®
did not interpret the BIT so as to set out a requirement concerning the origin of funds. In this
regard, the Claimant has argued that it made a financial contribution, and the Respondent does
not seem to contest this proposition, having confined its position in this respect to arguing that

the Claimant’s contribution did not originate outside the host state.

The Claimant, on its part mainly relying upon Czech treaty practice and the decision in Tokios
Tokelés, argues that the Czech nationality of its beneficiary owner and the extent of its economic
connection with the UK have no bearing upon the existence and scope of treaty protection under
the BIT and the ECT. The Tribunal agrees and finds that, contrary to the Respondent’s

contentions, the Claimant’s investment enjoys the protection of the BIT and the ECT.

Lastly, the Tribunal considered the Parties’ submissions regarding the alleged character of the
Claimant as a shell company, in connection with the question whether the holding of such an
entity is insufficient to constitute an investment over which the Tribunal can exercise jurisdiction.
This question arises out of the Respondent’s allegation that the Claimant’s corporate structure

entails no more than a holding, which cannot constitute an investment under the BIT.

The Tribunal’s observations regarding the general relevance of the decision in KT Asia above
hold true in relation to this argument as well. The Tribunal adds to the aforementioned
considerations that Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 1(6) of the ECT neither require that an
investment belongs to, or be owned by, an entity having a substantial connection with its place
of incorporation, nor do they preclude the protection of an investment made by an entity which

mainly serves as a holding company. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s contention that the

BIT and the ECT do not require that a substantial connection be established for a legal entity to

be deemed an investor and for its investment to be protected.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction ratione materiae over the

Claimant’s investments.

Consequently, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to address the Parties’ submissions in the
alternative, as well as those regarding the existence of an inherent meaning of investment and its
applicability to the present case, if any. Indeed, according to the chapeaux of the provisions, the
Tribunal is called upon to apply definitions created “[fJor the purposes of” the BIT and “[a]s used
in” the ECT.

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT CONSENTED TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN BIT CLAIMS

1. The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims of breach of the BIT’s fair

and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and non-impairment provisions.!”

These claims are brought under Article 2(2) of the BIT. Article 8(1) of the BIT (the investor-state
arbitration provision) makes express reference to a number of articles of the treaty — but does not

list amongst these Article 2(2).

The Claimant argues that, despite this omission, Article 8(1) does indeed cover Article 2(2) by
virtue of the express reference to the broad umbrella clause contained in Article 2(3), under which
the Respondent is under an obligation to respect the BIT in its entirety, including Article 2(2).

This, so the Claimant contends, is confirmed by Articles 8(2) and 8(3).!7!

The Claimant submits that it would be inconsistent with the principle of effet utile to exclude the
substantive standards set out in Article 2(2) from the scope of Article 8(1), as that would imply
that the reference in Article 8(1) to Article 2(3) would in substance be only to a portion thereof
and not to the full provision.'” The Claimant also contends that, the Respondent is incorrect in
invoking the /ex specialis principle to argue that the specific language of the arbitration clause

prevails over the general formulation of Article 2(3). According to the Claimant, there is no need

to resort to the /ex specialis principle when it is possible to reconcile the language of the

arbitration clause with the broad umbrella clause. '”

Furthermore, the Claimant argues that no reliance should be placed on the preparatory works of
the BIT, given the primarily textual character of treaty interpretation, and the fact that the
memoranda relied upon by the Respondent do not address the precise scope of Article 8(1).'™
The Claimant also considers that the decision in Nagel v. Czech Republic is irrelevant since,
despite having held inadmissible fair and equitable treatment and non-impairment claims under

the BIT, it did not address the scope of Article 2(3) in fine of the BIT.'"

The Claimant submits, in any event, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction by virtue of Article 2 of
the BIT, whereby UK nationals such as the Claimant are entitled to most favourable treatment,
including pursuant to the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, which in turn provides for arbitration
of fair and equitable treatment and non-impairment claims.'”° The Claimant argues that the
Respondents contention that the MFN clause in the BIT only creates obligations under domestic
law, lacks support in any authority and would deprive the MFN clause of any practical effect. To
avoid this result, the expression “under its law” should be understood as encompassing
international law incorporated into Czech law.'” In this vein, to the extent that the MFN
provision dealt with in Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentina guaranteed MEN treatment

in “its territory”, that case is, according to the Claimant, inapposite.'*

The Claimant further submits that, in light of several decisions confirming their applicability to

procedural matters, and the difficulty of distinguishing between procedure and substance, there

is no basis to exclude the applicability of MFN clauses to procedural matters.'”

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that all claims under the BIT fall outside the scope of its consent to

arbitration. '*°

With regard to the Claimant’s contention that the contested measures are in breach of obligations
under Article 2(2) of the BIT, the Respondent argues that claims concerning such obligations
cannot be brought under the UK BIT. In accordance with the principle expressio unius est
exclusio alterius and as held by the tribunal in Nagel, obligations under Article 2(2) are not
included in the “closed list of obligations” capable of submission to investor-State arbitration set
out in Article 8(1) of the BIT."'*!

On the Respondent's analysis, contrary to the Claimant’s arguments, neither Article 8(1) nor the
MEN clause expressly or in any other way authorizes arbitration of claims regarding Article 2(2)
of the UK BIT.'?

As for the Claimant’s submission that Article 2(2) claims are indirectly authorized by
Article 8(1), the Respondent argues that this is based on the proposition that the second sentence
of Article 2(3) operates as a broad umbrella clause encompassing violations of all substantive
obligations under Article 2 and of every other provision of the BIT. But on the Respondent’s
analysis, this proposition is “illogical”. '** Article 2(3) provides only that where a contract
between an investor and a host State is concluded, the host State is bound by both the BIT and
the contract.'** The Respondent argues that an “umbrella” clause is a treaty provision that
incorporates external obligations within the treaty’s sphere of protection. But the obligations that
the treaty creates are already under the treaty’s protection; a separate clause is not necessary to
make those obligations binding. If the Contracting State Parties had intended to refer in Article
8(1) to all of the substantive obligations contained in Article 2, the shortest —and simplest—way
to do this, according to the Respondent, would have been to use the words “Article 2.” There is
no basis to explain the use of a longer term (i.e., Article 2(3)) as shorthand for a shorter term (i.e.,
Article 2).!*° Nor does the reference in Article 8(1) to Article 2(3) serve as a basis for claims

regarding any BIT obligation, contrary to Claimant’s interpretation, since if this were so, the

express reference to three other provisions in Article 8(1) (in addition to Article 2(3)) would be
redundant or without effect.'*°This interpretation, according to the Respondent, defies logic and
is at odds with the intention of the Parties.'*’ In contrast, the Respondent's logical interpretation
gives full effect to the provision, in accordance with the principle of effet utile, and is consistent

with the BIT’s drafting history.'**

As for the Claimant’s argument that Article 2(2) claims are authorized by Article 3, the BIT’s
MEN clause, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s position contradicts established
jurisprudence, which confines a tribunal’s jurisdiction in respect of a list of treaty provisions to
those provisions only and does not permit the expansion of jurisdiction to other treaty provisions

through an MEN clause.'*?

Furthermore, in light of the text of Article 3 and the decision, in analogous circumstances, in
Daimler v. Argentina, the right to pursue international law claims through arbitration, invariably
taking place outside the host State’s territory, falls outside the scope of the MFN clause.'° Also,
the proposition that the term “law” in Article 3 cannot be limited to domestic law, as foreign
nationals are frequently granted rights only by treaty and rarely by ordinary legislation,'”' is not
supported by any authority and is inconsistent with the Claimant’s legitimate expectations

argument.'?

Thirdly, given that in UK treaty practice, the application of MFN treatment to international
dispute resolution is expressly provided for in the treaty’s text, the absence of such express

reference in Article 3 entails that it falls outside the scope of the MEN clause.'>

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

As already set out earlier, the Tribunal once again recalls that the interpretation of a treaty
provision is governed by the customary international law rules as codified in Articles 31 and 32

of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This is not disputed by the Parties.

Article 8 of the BIT, entitled “Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a Host State”,
provides as follows:
“(1) Disputes between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party
concerning an obligation of the latter under Articles 2(3), 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement in
relation to an investment of the former which have not been amicably settled shall, after a
period of four months from written notification of a claim, be submitted to arbitration under
paragraph (2) below if either party to the dispute so wishes.
(2) Where the dispute is referred to arbitration, the investor concerned in the dispute shall
have the right to refer the dispute either to:
(a) an arbitrator or ad hoc arbitral tribunal to be appointed by a special agreement or
established and conducted under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law; the parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify these
Rules, or
(b) the Institute of Arbitration of the Chamber of Commerce of Stockholm, or
(c) the Court of Arbitration of the Federal Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Vienna.
(3) The arbitrator or arbitral tribunal to which the dispute is referred under paragraph (2)

shall, in particular, base its decision on the provisions of this Agreement.”

Pursuant to Article 8(1), the categories of disputes which “shall [...] be submitted to arbitration”
are expressly limited to those which: (i) [arise] “between an investor of one Contracting Party
and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under Articles 2(3), 4, 5
and 6 of this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former”; and (ii) “have not been

amicably settled” once “a period of four months from written notification of a claim” has elapsed.

Therefore, under Article 8(1) of the BIT, the first condition which a claim has to meet to be

 

capable of submission to arbitration is that it concerns a breach of an obligation under
“Articles 2(3), 4, 5 and 6” of the BIT. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the conclusions
reached by the tribunal in Nage/, which held that “Article 8(1) only states that disputes under
Articles 2(3), 4, 5 and 6 may be submitted to arbitration and there is nothing in the text to indicate
that the arbitration may also include other questions arising under the Treaty.”'™ Likewise, the
Tribunal agrees with the stance adopted by the tribunal in WNC Factoring, which held that “[t]he
meaning of Article 8(1) is clear” and that “[t]he only obligations that may be subject of arbitration

195

are those contained in the specified articles, including Article 2(3).”"” An interpretation to the

effect that Article 8(1) encompasses claims concerning obligations beyond those under “Articles

2(3), 4, 5 and 6” would obviously render the detailed specification of articles in Article 8(1)

“superfluous”, as the WNC Factoring tribunal found.'*° The Tribunal therefore agrees with the

Respondent’s reliance on the principle of effet utile in connection with the interpretation of
Article 8(1) of the BIT.'”

The issue then is whether Article 2(3) can be interpreted as encompassing obligations under
Article 2(2), among others, so as to bring the latter within the scope of the consent to arbitration

in Article 8(1).
Article 2(3), entitled “Promotion and Protection of Investment”, reads:

(3) Investors of one Contracting Party may conclude with the other Contracting Party
specific agreements, the provisions and effect of which, unless more beneficial to the
investor, shall not be at variance with this Agreement. Each Contracting Party shall, with
regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, observe the provisions of

these specific agreements, as well as the provisions of this Agreement.”

In the Tribunal’s view, Article 2(3) sets out a special regime within the BIT which governs the
obligations of the Contracting Parties when a Contracting Party has concluded a “specific
agreement” with an investor. The two sentences contained in paragraph (3) of Article 2, and the
special rules they contain, have no application beyond the conclusion of such specific

agreements.

In other words, none of the provisions contained in the two sentences in Article 2(3) is separable,
as a matter of their interpretation and application. Rather, both are contingent upon the conclusion
of a specific agreement, and govern the position with respect to investments of an investor in

such circumstances.

In this vein, the Tribunal agrees with the propositions of the tribunal in WNC Factoring, to the
effect that Article 2(3) “must be read [...] in its entirety” and that its second sentence, “does not
sit apart as a separate requirement”.'** This holds true for Article 2(3), first sentence. Also,
without prejudice to the existence of two separate provisions, in each sentence of Article 2(3),
the conclusion of a “specific agreement” is their common condition for application, in the absence

of which none of the two provisions is applicable.

More specifically, the first sentence of Article 2(3) sets out a prohibition and an implied
permission, whereby, respectively, provisions in the specific agreements may not be “at variance”
with the BIT and, if any provision in the specific agreement is “at variance”, such variance is

permissible only if and to the extent that it is “more beneficial to the investor”. As articulated by

 

the a “specific " ing to this provision is a contract the content of

which must not be less beneficial than the BIT.

The second sentence of Article 2(3) provides that the Contracting Parties are obliged to observe
“the provision of these specific agreements, as well as the provisions of” the BIT. Importantly,
the obligation under Article 2(3), second sentence, is applicable only in relation to the set of
obligations of a Contracting Party to the BIT under provisions of a “specific agreement” in
conjunction with the BIT. In this regard, the Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that the
purpose of the second sentence of Article 2(3) is to make clear that the host state is bound by

both the BIT and the “specific agreement”.

The Tribunal also notes that, to the extent that the “specific agreement” contains obligations
“equivalent or superior” to those under the BIT, obligations under the BIT may be binding upon
the Contracting Party to the BIT not only qua the BIT but also qua the “specific agreement”, as
suggested by the tribunal in WNC Factoring. It observed that “the Contracting Party has an
obligation both to adhere to the specific agreement and to observe the BIT protections in so far
as those protections are contained in the specific agreement”, in which case, for instance “if a
specific agreement contained a protection tantamount to the FET standard, a tribunal would have
jurisdiction to consider a breach of that standard”.'”” Nevertheless, since the Parties’ difference
is not concerned with obligations binding upon the Respondent qua a specific agreement, no
question arises as to obligations other than those under and qua the BIT and which are capable

of submission to arbitration under Article 8(1).

It is worth noting that the award in WNC Factoring (which also concerned the UK-Czech
Republic BIT) made clear that an “obligation in a specific agreement where that obligation is
mirrored in the BIT but not captured by Article 8(1)” would bar a respondent from alleging lack
of jurisdiction.” The Tribunal observies that this principle has no relevance in the present case,

since no specific agreement has been relied upon by the Claimant.”

The Tribunal has also taken into account certain grammatical features of the second sentence of
Article 2(3). In particular, the Tribunal notes the use of the word “these”, in relation to “specific
agreements”, and of the phrase “as well as”, which serves as a coordinating conjunction before
“the Agreement”, i.e., the BIT. The Tribunal considers that these features imply that obligations
under “specific agreements” and the BIT are equally binding and, more importantly for present
purposes, that the obligations of a Contracting Party for the purposes of Article 2(3), second
sentence, are those which arise in connection with the specific agreement, namely under the
provisions of the “specific agreement” in conjunction with, or “in addition to”, those under the
provisions of the BIT. Therefore, in this particular context, the obligation to observe the
provisions of the BIT is applicable only in conjunction with, and only to the extent that they are

additional to, those under a specific agreement.

The Tribunal agrees with the conclusions reached by the tribunal in WNC Factoring that, in
accordance with the ordinary meaning of the text of the provision, the use of “these” in the second
sentence of Article 2(3) is intended as a reference to the provisions in the first sentence of Article
2(3) and imply a “renvoi to the scope given to ‘specific agreements’ in the first sentence”. This
analysis coincides with the Tribunal’s conclusion that the reference to “the provisions of this
Agreement” in Article 2(3), second sentence, only applies to the extent that a specific agreement
within the meaning of Article 2(3), first sentence, has been concluded. Such a renvoi is a feature

of this specific regime within the BIT.

In conclusion, therefore, as put by the WNC Factoring tribunal, Article 2(3) “read in conjunction
with Article 8(1) [...] cannot be intended to extend an arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction to all other

substantive obligations in the BIT”.2%

It follows that on the Tribunal’s analysis, Article 2(3), second sentence, does not extend the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to all other BIT obligations, including obligations found in Articles 2(1)
and 2(2). Therefore, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s contention that it has jurisdiction under
Article 8(1), in conjunction with Article 2(3), of the BIT, over claims concerning obligations

under Article 2(2) of the BIT.™

The Tribunal turns now to the subsidiary submission of the Claimant and the related question of
whether, pursuant to Article 3(1), it is entitled to MFN treatment, so as to be able to rely upon

provisions of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT.

Article 3, which sets out the “National Treatment and Most-favoured-nation Provisions”, reads:

“(1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure that under its law investments or returns of investors
of the other Contracting Party are granted treatment not less favourable than that which it
accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investments or returns of investors
of any third State.

(2) Each Contracting Party shall ensure that under its law investors of the other Contracting
Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their
investments, are granted treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to its own

investors or to investors of any third State.”

The Tribunal observes, as noted by the WNC Factoring tribunal, that the differences of the Parties
regarding MFN treatment concern “a dispute as to the application and interpretation of Article 3,
which is not provided for in Article 8(1).”*°5 Article 3, however, is not listed in Article 8(1). It
follows, therefore, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to consider any claim based upon Article
3 (which would include, inter alia, the question of whether the scope of its jurisdiction may be

expanded by virtue of MFN treatment pursuant to this provision).

The Tribunal, in conclusion, finds that it lacks jurisdiction under Article 8(1) over claims under
Article 2(2) of the BIT.

WHETHER THE SOLAR LEVY IS A TAX FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ECT TAX CARVE-OUT
(ARTICLE 21 ECT)

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Solar Levy as this measure
is a tax under Czech law for purposes of the ECT’s tax exclusion clause set out in Article 21 of
the ECT. The Respondent observes that the Claimant itself considered the Tax Incentives to
be taxation measures”” and contends that the only disagreement with the Claimant pertains to

the characterization of the Acts which adopted and extended the Solar Levy as “Taxation

Measures”.°*

The Respondent agrees with the Claimant that Article 31 of the VCLT governs the interpretation
of Article 21(7) of the ECT. It submits that the Contracting State parties gave the term “Taxation
Measures” a special meaning, whereby, for the determination of the character of a measure as a
“provision relating to taxes of the domestic law” within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the

ECT, the Tribunal “must look to the domestic law of the Czech Republic”.””

The Respondent contests all of the Claimant’s arguments which contradict this proposition for
the following reasons (broadly summarized): (1) the use of domestic law to determine the
characterization of a measure as a tax is justified, given the express renvoi to domestic law in
Article 21 of the ECT and the importance of a state’s taxation power, which is admitted by the

Claimant;2!”

(2) the intention of the ECT’s drafters lends support to the need to resort to domestic
law, as evidenced by Article 21(5) of the ECT, which calls upon competent domestic tax
authorities to state their views as to the limited number of tax-related issues capable of submission
to international arbitration;”!' (3) the Claimant has not explained why the use of domestic law

would undermine the ECT’s purpose;?!?

and (4) it is not contrary to good faith that states have
resort to their own domestic law, for, as a matter of fact, states are free to opt out of international
obligations. In any event, the Respondent has not sought to act as judge and jury or to escape its
international obligations, as it has accepted that the Tribunal will make the ultimate determination

as to whether the Solar Levy meets the definition set out in Article 21(7) of the ECT.2?

The Respondent, referring to the decision in Emmis and others v. Hungary, argues that the
character of the Solar Levy must be established with reference to Czech domestic law. Like any
tax, the Solar Levy has a rate, a base and a taxpayer, and was treated as a tax by the Czech
legislative, executive and judicial organs. This is evidenced, most notably, by its inclusion in the
Tax Administration Law (“TAL”) and its characterization by the Czech Constitutional Court as
a “tax or fee” within the meaning of Article 11(5) of the Czech Republic’s Charter of

Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (“Charter”), holding that the Solar Levy, like any other taxes,

should be “levied only on the basis of the law.”?"* In this connection, the Respondent notes that
Article 11(5) of the Charter and Section 2(3) of the TAL are legislative instruments for the
purposes of Article 21(7) of the ECT. In response to the Claimant’s argument that Article 11(5)
of the Charter is inconclusive so far as the question whether the Solar Levy constitutes a tax is
concerned, as it refers to “taxes and fees”, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not argue
that the Solar Levy is a “fee” rather than a “tax”. In addition, the Solar Levy is classified as a tax
by the OECD and EUROSTAT. Moreover, the reason for taxes and fees being treated under the
same umbrella in the TAL is that Czech legal and accounting practice does not differentiate
between taxes and other public charges.”'* Furthermore, the Respondent draws the Tribunal’s
attention to the fact that the ECT only requires that the Solar Levy be a measure “relating to taxes
of the domestic law”, which is presently the case as it is designated as a tax in the Czech

Republi

 

's Tax Code, is collected as such, and is accounted for and reported as a tax.7!° Hence,
in light of the above, the Solar Levy qualifies as a “Taxation Measure” under Article 21(7), and

is thus covered by the carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT.2!”

The Respondent emphasizes that the character of the Solar Levy must be determined by reference
to Czech legislation, and not to academic literature. In relation to the place of “academic theory”,
the Respondent submits that the ECT does not call for an academic exercise, since Article 21(7)
of the ECT places exclusive reliance upon legislation and the Contracting States’ power to decide
what is a tax. In any event, academic theory is unhelpful in this case, given the inherent lack of
clarity of the term “taxes”, acknowledged in scholarly writing.?'* However, even if the Tribunal
were to consider “academic theory” relevant, the Respondent submits that the Solar Levy

possesses the six features identified and relied upon by the Claimant as the test of a taxation

measure.?!? In particular, it is uncontested that the Solar Levy is obligatory, non-refundable,
introduced by law and intended to serve as income of the state budget for the financing of society-

wide needs.

In addition to the above, the Respondent claims that the Solar Levy is also non-equivalent.
According to the Respondent, this fact is acknowledged by the Claimant’s experts who state that
the Solar Levy is “formally indeed non-equivalent,” and that “equivalence” exists only “to a
certain extent.”””° The Respondent contends that the right to receive the FiT is independent from
the Solar Levy “due to the absence of an immediate, direct and concrete consideration in return
on the part of the public authority”.””' Instead, the right derives from the obligation of compulsory
purchasers to purchase RES electricity at a fixed price. Indeed, solar plants installed before the
solar boom and producers of non-solar forms of RES electricity are equally entitled to the FiT,

22

but not liable to pay the Solar Levy.~ The relationship between the Solar Levy and the FiT is
confined to the fact that both are charged on the same product, namely electricity produced by
solar RES, at an amount which corresponds to a fixed proportion of the price received for such
electricity. Similar relations are commonly seen in relation to other taxes, such as VAT, which
amounts to a percentage of the value of goods and services the consumption of which is taxed.”>
In short, payment of the Solar Levy involves no “quid pro quo” in consideration for receiving

the FiT.2*

In addition, the budgetary expenditure subsidizing RES actually increased in 2014, whereas the
Solar Levy payable by solar generators in receipt of FiT support was reduced by Act 310/2013
Coll. from 26% to 10%, thus illustrating the lack of any correlation.”* In this vein, the
Respondent argues that the amount of the budget subsidy is not calculated by reference to the
amounts collected through the Solar Levy and that, unlike the budget subsidy, Solar Levy

revenues were a function of the quantity of electricity produced by solar RES producers. While

the Solar Levy was originally expected to offset approximately one third of the budgetary
expenditure on RES subsidies, this was merely an estimate and, ultimately, no correlation ever

existed in practice.””*

Contrary to the Claimant’s argument, the Solar Levy is also not a fee. In particular, it is not paid
on a transactional basis; it is not “voluntary”; and it is not “irregular”.””” In any case, the
Claimant’s proposition that the Solar Levy is a fee for receiving the FiT is inconsequential, since
the distinction between taxes and fees is of very limited significance under contemporary Czech
tax law and practice, and given that fees “relate to” taxes, within the meaning of Article 21(7) of
the ECT, to the extent that a fee administered by the TAL is part of the Czech tax system.”

Moreover, the Solar Levy is not paid for a specific purpose. Leaving aside the irrelevance of
legislative reasons for this purpose and the existence of purpose-oriented taxes, as exemplified
by road taxes, the absence of a specific purpose is demonstrated by the fact that proceeds of the
Solar Levy were deposited into the general treasury account.” Given its nature as a revenue
raising measure, which was meant to reduce excessive profits, the Solar Levy on the contrary

was a tax measure perfectly consistent with bona fide taxation purposes.”*”

The Respondent argues further that the Solar Levy is treated as a tax by the Czech judicial organs,
most notably by the Constitutional Court in a decision specifically examining the Solar Levy,
and the Supreme Administrative Court.”*! In particular relation to the decisions of the Supreme
Administrative Court, the Respondent emphasizes that the judgment of the Grand Chamber of

17 December 2013 confirmed that the Solar Levy was a tax. That is a ruling which enjoys greater

authority than, and is not affected by, those adopted by individual panels, such as the judgment
of 10 July 2014 of the Supreme Administrative Court relied upon by the Claimant. To the extent
that the latter decision held that the Solar Levy was not of a tax nature, on grounds of its non-
equivalence, this conclusion was set out in a “single-paragraph obiter statement” which, in the
opinion of the Respondent, resulted from the panel’s lack of familiarity with the mechanics of

RES support.”

Furthermore, the Czech authorities did not argue before the Supreme Administrative Court that
the Solar Levy is not a tax and are, thus, not estopped from alleging that it is, in fact, a tax. The
Claimant’s allegation is based on an unwarranted assumption and disproved most notably by the
fact that the dictum that the Solar Levy is not a tax was rendered by the Supreme Administrative
Court sua sponte.”*

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s remaining indicators of the non-tax nature of the Solar
Levy are wrong. As for the submission to Parliament of draft Act 402/2010 by the Ministry of
Industry and Trade instead of the Ministry of Finance, the Respondent observes that the Ministry
of Finance and the Government as a whole were involved in the process, which led to the adoption
of the Solar Levy. With regard to the use of the term “levy”, the Respondent states that the use
of the term resulted from the Ministry of Finance’s practice of using different terminology for ad
hoc taxes introduced by general legislation. In any event, there are other levies in Czech
legislation, most of which are taxes.”*> As for the limited extent of the group of taxpayers, the
Respondent observes that there are taxes in the Czech system for the payment of which only
several hundred subjects are liable." The Respondent alleges that the acknowledgement of the
potential expropriatory effects of the Solar Levy by the Constitutional Court relates to the
constitutionality of the measure, not its tax nature. In any event, the Constitutional Court did not
find the Solar Levy to be a confiscatory tax.’*” As for the temporary nature of the Solar Levy, the

Respondent argues that temporary taxes have been levied in the Czech Republic in the past and

that there is no requirement that a measure be indefinite in order to qualify as a tax.7** From the
foregoing, it follows, according to the Respondent, that both the Solar Levy and the Tax Holiday,

the character as a tax of which is not in dispute, are taxes.”

Finally, and in response to the allegation that the Solar Levy was enacted in bad faith, the
Respondent submits that the Claimant’s allegations of impropriety are unfounded; the Solar Levy
applied to all solar producers, regardless of whether they were entitled to investment treaty
protection.” Referring to the decision of the tribunal in Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru, the
Respondent argues that good faith must, in principle, be assumed;*"' that, in any case, the Energy
Charter Secretariat 2015 publication does not suggest that taxes must be imposed in good faith;
and that, even if it were accepted that bad faith was involved, such conduct would only be relevant
to the merits,“ but it would not affect the character as a tax of the Solar Levy under Czech
domestic law. Furthermore, the Respondent submits that no bad faith can be inferred from the
use of a mechanism, which the Claimant deems convoluted since, as observed by the tribunal in
Invesmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic, not having resort to the most obvious solution is not an
automatic indication of bad faith.** To conclude, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal

decline jurisdiction in relation to the Claimant’s ECT claims.

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant challenges the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction, and in particular its
submission that the Solar Levy is a tax due to its characterization as such under Czech law and
that the VCLT plays no role, since the ECT defines “taxation measure” by express reference to

domestic law.**

Pointing out that what is at issue is the interpretation of a treaty provision, the Claimant argues

that the applicable rules of interpretation are contained in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, whereby

the definition of “taxation measure” set out in Article 21(7) of the ECT must be interpreted in

good faith, bearing in mind the context and the object and purpose of the ECT."

In this connection, the Claimant argues that, as recognized by the Respondent, the VCLT is
applicable to, and plays a central role in, the interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT.77 In
particular, the Claimant contends that, since the Respondent has failed to establish that a “special
meaning” pursuant to Article 31(4) of the VCLT is to be attributed to the term “taxation
measures” in Article 21(7) of the ECT, only its “ordinary meaning” is to be taken into account.*“*
Furthermore, the Claimant maintains that the renvoi to domestic law does not preclude the
application of Article 31(1) of the VCLT to the interpretation of Article 21(7) of the ECT, due to

the latter’s international nature as a treaty provision.”

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 21(7) of the ECT,
according to which a contracting state’s mere characterization of a measure as “taxation” would
suffice to remove it from the scope of the ECT, is at odds with the ECT’s drafters’ intention, the
good faith standard, and the purpose of the ECT. In particular, relying upon the decisions in Yukos

Universal Limited v. Russia,” RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,”

and Quasar
de Valores v. The Russian Federation, the Claimant argues that a good faith interpretation of
the ECT tax carve-out is called for, whereby it is confined to bona fide measures. Contracting
States are thereby prevented from an otherwise unrestricted freedom to escape their obligations
under the ECT.2® In this vein, the Claimant maintains that a determination as to the bona fide
character of a measure is crucial to establish whether it is a “taxation measure” within the
meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and, thus, of relevance not only to the merits of, but also to a

tribunal’s jurisdiction over, a dispute arising out of such a measure.”**

introduced to raise budget revenue, as claimed by the Respondent, but was instead a deliberate
use of its power to tax to avoid international responsibility.*° According to the Claimant a State’s
authority over taxation matters is not absolute and, thus, an interpretation of the tax carve-out to
the effect that reliance is to be placed exclusively upon domestic law would be contrary to the
principle of good faith and the ECT’s purpose.”*’ Furthermore, the Claimant, contesting the
relevance of the decisions relied upon by the Respondent, argues that Article 21 of the ECT does
not permit a State to opt out of its obligations thereunder, nor does it allow a State to deny the

ECT’s protection to an investor.”

The Claimant adds that the lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent is evidenced by the
rationale of, and background to, the Solar Levy; the use of taxation as a mechanism to disguise a
reduction of the amount of support accorded to solar energy producers; and the inconsistent

conduct of the Respondent following the enactment of the Solar Levy.”

As for the abusiveness of the Respondent’s exercise of its taxation power, the Claimant submits
that this power was used to adopt a measure, which was clearly not a tax, as evidenced by
declarations of the Deputy Environmental Minister and the Minister of Industry and Trade at

meetings held by the Economic Coordination C i and the E ic Ce i of the

 

Chamber of Deputies on 15 October” and 2 November 2010," respectively. The Claimant does
not accept that an attempt to find a lawful solution to a problem is necessarily an indication of
good faith, since compliance with domestic law is not an excuse for breaches of international
obligations. Also, the Claimant does not accept that the applicability of the Solar Levy regardless
of the nationality of solar energy producers demonstrated that their ability to invoke investment
treaty protection had not been considered. In this regard, the Claimant highlights that the

Respondent sought legal opinions concerning the risks of investment arbitration as a result of the

enactment of the Solar Levy.

As for the inconsistency of the Respondent’s conduct, the Claimant refers to the 10 July 2014
decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, which in the context of a decision
addressing the issue of whether, in combination with the corporate income tax, the Solar Levy
would have been in breach of the prohibition of double taxation, held that the Solar Levy is not
a tax.” According to the Claimant, the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court should
preclude any further discussion in this arbitration as to the nature of the Solar Levy as a tax under

Czech law.7

The Claimant contests the relevance of the rulings relied upon by the Respondent in support of
the proposition that, in accordance with Czech case law, the Solar Levy is not a tax. Instead, the
Claimant submits that: (1) the question of whether the Solar Levy is a tax was directly addressed
by the Supreme Administrative Court and not merely in an obiter portion of the decision; (2) the
judgment of the Grand Chamber of 17 December 2013, relied upon by the Respondent, only
characterized the Solar Levy as a tax, because it is administered according to the TAL; (3) the
decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 10 July 2014 is not isolated, since several other
judgments of Czech courts, including the Constitutional Court and the Second and Fifth
Chambers of the Supreme Administrative Court have ruled that the Solar Levy is not a tax, but a

de facto reduction of the FiT.“°

With regard to the Respondent’s purported explanations for the implementation of the Solar Levy
instead of a direct reduction of the FiT, the Claimant advances a number of arguments. In
response to the proposition that a direct reduction of the FiT would have needed to be much
greater than 26%, the Claimant notes that this is unsupported by the facts. In fact, while during
the meeting of the Economic Committee of 2 November 2010 an increase of the Solar Levy rate

from 26% to 50% was discussed so as to avoid the imposition of a tax on emission allowances,

the question of a direct reduction of the FiT was not in issue.”® Also, the Solar Levy is not
necessarily more flexible than a reduction of the FiT, nor temporary, and, in any case, a reduction
of the FiT did not have to be permanent.”°7 In addition, the enactment of a direct reduction of the

FiT would not have been more cumbersome than the introduction of the Solar Levy.?

The Claimant characterizes the Solar Levy as a reduction of a promised benefit, adopted in the
form of a tax for the purpose of taking advantage of the tax carve-out under the ECT. This is
allegedly evidenced by discussions in the Czech Parliament prior to the adoption of Act No.
402/2010, most notably during a meeting of the Emergency Coordination Committee held in
October 2010,” and the Respondent’s own allegation that the measure was in fact not a tax,
made in connection with a challenge to the Solar Levy before the Czech Supreme Court.?” The
Claimant adds that the Respondent, for this reason, is now estopped from arguing that the Solar
Levy is a bona fide tax under international law.” For its part, the Claimant also contends that it
is not estopped from characterizing the Solar Levy as a non-tax measure, most notably since
terms used in the SPV’s financial statements are irrelevant for the purposes of determining the

nature of the Solar Levy as a tax.”

In addition, the Claimant further contends that the Solar Levy is not a tax under Czech law.??
According to the Claimant, Article 11(5) of the Charter and Section 2(3) of the TAL are irrelevant
for the determination of the nature of the Solar Levy, since (1) both provisions and related
accounting and budgetary regulations do not distinguish between taxes and fees; (2) Article 2(3)
of the TAL contains no general definition of tax, which is absent in the Czech legal system; and

(3) in any case, the Czech legislator knowingly employed the label “levy” instead of “tax”?

Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the Solar Levy does not possess the six features of a tax,

namely, that it is: (1) obligatory, (2) non-refundable, (3) non-equivalent, (4) introduced by law,

(5) intended to serve as income, and (6) paid for no specific purpose.” In light of these features,

the Claimant puts forward a number of specific arguments, as broadly summarized below.

First, the Solar Levy was enacted and “earmarked” for a specific purpose, namely to offset the
costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with the support it had undertaken to provide to
solar energy producers without formally reducing the level of tariffs guaranteed to them.?” This
purpose is clearly indicated by the parliamentary discussions leading to the introduction of Act
No. 402/2010. Therefore, the Solar Levy lacks one typical feature of all taxes, according to

academic theory.””

In this vein, the Claimant argues that the legislative reasons for implementing the Solar Levy are
“irrelevant for the purposes of the “specific purpose’ inquiry”. Instead, the Tribunal should focus
on the “purpose for which the funds are actually allocated”.?”* The Claimant argues further that

the existence of a specific purpose is a mandatory feature of taxes; that the Solar Levy is a de

facto reduction of the FiT and not a revenue-raising measure and therefore does not meet the

bona fide test as articulated by the Yukos tribunal; and that reliance on the fact that the Solar Levy
is collected in a separate account, not administered by the same Ministry in charge of budgetary
contributions to the FiT, entails a formalistic distinction and is irrelevant since the cash flows of
the Solar Levy and the RES support subsidy are connected through the State budget.?”

Second, the Claimant argues that the Solar Levy does not meet the non-equivalence requirement,
which is a mandatory requirement of all taxes. This entails that no consideration on the part of
the State for the payment of a tax must be involved, as acknowledged by all four party experts.”*”
According to the Claimant, there was a direct link, or a “guid pro quo”, between the Solar Levy
and the payment of FiT and Green Bonuses.”*! This conclusion finds support in the decision of
the Czech Supreme Administrative Court of 10 July 2014, which held that the Solar Levy was

Claimant’s submission, is thorough and highly authoritative, therefore dealing a fatal blow to the

283

Respondent’s argument.” In particular, the decision lends further support to the fundamental

character of non-equivalence as a feature of all taxes, and also confirms that the Solar Levy fails

to meet the non-equivalence standard, a conclusion shared by Messrs. Borkovec and Fryzek.”4

With respect to certain decisions of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court and the

Constitutional Court relied upon by the Respondent,”** the Claimant contends that only the

 

decision of 10 July 2014 actually analysed the Solar Levy, and that the references to the Solar
Levy as a “tax” in the other decisions are either vague or confined to the character as a tax for
the purposes of the TAL. In any event, these decisions were without prejudice to the finding of
the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court which held that, while being a “tax”
within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the TAL, the Solar Levy resulted in a de facto decrease of
the level of support to solar energy producers.”*°

The Claimant further contends that the Respondent is estopped from claiming in these
proceedings that the Solar Levy is not linked to the FiT, given certain statements of the Czech
Ministry of Finance before the Constitutional Court.**’ In this regard, the Claimant contends that
the Respondent’s view that the only link between the FiT and the Solar Levy is that “the former

29288

is the taxable base of the latter” is disproved by the referenced statements of the Minister of

Finance, to the effect that income from the Solar Levy “serves to compensate the additional
expenses associated with the obligation to purchase electricity from solar radiation” and that the

Administrative Court decision of 10 July 2014 (para. 19 and 20), which — as of today — remains the sole

aspects”?

Third, five further indicators of the non-tax nature of the Solar Levy exist:?” (1) the enactment
of Act No. 402/2010 differed from the usual legislative process, as the bill was submitted to
Parliament by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, unlike most taxation measures which are

presented by the Ministry of Finance;”!

(2) the Solar Levy applies to “a narrow group of

“levy” was employed, instead of “tax”, without explanation; and (5) the Solar Levy was not
proportional, as it may have “strangling” or “liquidating” effects according to the Czech
Constitutional Court.” In addition, the possession of features present in other types of payments,
such as certain “fees”, does not render the Solar Levy a tax, nor do accounting, budgetary and

Ecuador, and Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador, each brought against Ecuador
under different U.S. and Canadian treaties, is not applicable to the Solar Levy, since the tax carve-

outs involved in those treaties did not define “tax” or “taxation measure”, unlike the ECT.

the Solar Levy, despite having been introduced by law, does not meet the other requirements of
that definition, since it is unclear that the narrow group of taxpayers amounts to a “class of
persons”, no payment was made to the State, which merely acted as collecting agent but did not

retain any funds, and no public purpose existed.”

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

Preliminarily, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ disagreement regarding the ECT’s tax carve-
out is limited to the question whether the Solar Levy constitutes a “Taxation Measure” within the
meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and, as such, is excluded from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under
the ECT. As the Respondent contends, the Claimant “does not deny that the Tax Incentives
provided for by the Act on Income Tax are ‘taxation measures’ covered by the carve-out,” and
that “Claimant’s only disagreement with the Czech Republic’s analysis relates to the

characterization — for purposes of the ECT — of the Acts that introduced and extended the Solar

Levy as “Taxation Measures,””” a proposition that the Respondent repeated at the Hearing”

and that the Claimant did not challenge at any time.

As a consequence, the Tribunal has little doubt that the Income Tax measures and the Shortened
Depreciation fall within the ECT’s tax carve-out. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts that it lacks
jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims regarding those two measures under the ECT. The
Tribunal’s analysis is therefore limited to the question whether it has jurisdiction under the ECT

over the Claimant’s claims related to the Solar Levy.

The Tribunal’s analysis begins with the burden of proof. The “Taxation” provision of the ECT
relied upon by the Respondent is an exception to the more general provisions of the ECT. As
such, it is clear that the Respondent bears the burden of proof of establishing that the Solar Levy
may be characterized as a “provision relating to taxes of the domestic law” within the meaning

of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT.

This allocation of the burden of proof is consistent with the text of Article 21 of the ECT, which
provides in relevant part: “Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting
Parties.” It is also consistent with the character of Taxation Measures as an exception to the more

general terms of the ECT. The Respondent indeed does not dispute that it bears the burden of

proof that the Solar Levy constitutes a “tax” or “Taxation Measure” within the meaning of
Article 21.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent has not discharged this burden of proof. As discussed
below, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Solar Levy constitutes a “tax” as a matter of Czech
law, as principally contended by the Respondent. Likewise, even apart from Czech law, the
Tribunal is not persuaded that the Solar Levy may be characterized as a tax or Taxation Measure
within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT. As a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that it
does not lack jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims related to the Solar Levy under the ECT on

this ground.

First, the Respondent’s primary contention is that the Tribunal “must look to the domestic law of
the Czech Republic” ”' in determining whether the Solar Levy is a tax within the meaning of
Article 21 of the ECT. The Tribunal is satisfied that the application of the ECT’s tax carve-out is
conditional on the State invoking the Article 21 exception, characterizing the putative “Taxation

Measure” as a tax in nature and substance as a matter of its domestic law.

It is undisputed, and the Tribunal agrees, that Article 21 must be interpreted in accordance with
the standards set out by the VCLT, particularly in its Article 31, and international law

302

generally.”~ This requires that effect be given to Article 21(7)’s renvoi to the domestic law of
the Contracting Party invoking Article 21. Indeed, Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT refers expressly
to a “provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party” (emphasis added).
The Tribunal shares the Respondent’s view that this “means necessarily that the relevant

assessment must be made under the domestic law of the respondent State.”*°*

 

This

   

interpretation is consistent with the text of Article 21(7). It is, in the Tribunal’s view, also
consistent with Article 21’s objective to permit, within the limits of the provision, Contracting

Parties to carve-out measures from certain ECT standards — that is to “exclude a taxation measure

 

from the coverage of the standards of protection.”*™ Critically, however, unless a Contracting
State has itself chosen to characterize a measure as a tax measure in its own domestic legal order,
that measure does not fall within the scope of Article 21 of the ECT. In short, Article 21 applies,

prima facie, only to those measures which constitute taxation measures within the legal order of

the State invoking the Article 21 exception. (As discussed below, there are also international
limits imposed by Article 21 on those measures which a Contracting State may define as tax

measures as a matter of its domestic law, but this is a separate and subsequent issue.)

Applying this analysis, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent has discharged its
burden of proving that the Solar Levy was a tax as a matter of domestic Czech law. Rather, the
expert evidence and other materials before the Tribunal indicate that the Solar Levy was regarded
as a tax as a matter of Czech law only for certain limited purposes, but as something other than a
tax for other, more significant, purposes. In the Tribunal’s view, this is insufficient to justify a
conclusion that the Solar Levy was characterized by Czech law as a tax within the meaning of
Article 21 of the ECT.

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Solar Levy was titled just that — the “Solar
Levy” — not the “Solar Tax” or the like. Where the inquiry is whether a measure is characterized
as a tax or taxation measure under Czech law, it is of some significance that the measure was, in
contrast to many other fiscal measures in the Czech Republic, not denominated by the Czech
legislature as a tax. If this were the only consideration militating against characterization of the
Solar Levy as a tax under Czech law, the Tribunal would be reluctant to attach dispositive weight
to it. However, as discussed below, there are other, more substantial, considerations that point

against characterization of the measure as a tax under Czech law.

Most importantly, the Tribunal notes that the 10 July 2014 decision of the Czech Supreme
Administrative Court held that, for double taxation purposes, the Solar Levy is not a tax under
Czech law. The Court addressed the question whether, combined with the corporate income tax,
the Solar Levy would have entailed an unlawful double taxation, and rejected that conclusion,
holding that the Solar Levy was not a tax, but rather “in nature” a reduction of the government
subsidy (FiT and Green Bonuses).*°° The Supreme Administrative Court reasoned that “[tJhe
subject of the [Solar Levy] is the amount resulting from the consideration of stipulating the

396 which led it to conclude

amount of government support for this type of economic activity,”
that the Solar Levy lacked the essential feature of “non-equivalence,” which in its view was

necessary for categorization of the measure as a “tax” under Czech law. *°”
There is no dispute that the Czech Supreme Administrative Court was the Czech Republic’s

highest judicial authority on the (non-constitutional) questions it addressed regarding the nature
of the Solar Levy. In its 10 July 2014 decision, the Court specifically addressed the nature and
substance of the Solar Levy. The Tribunal has little doubt that this characterization was not an
obiter statement, but a necessary clement in the Court’s holding. The Tribunal also notes that
other judgments of Czech courts, including the Constitutional Court and Chambers of the
Supreme Administrative Court have likewise found the Solar Levy to be, in essence, a reduction

of the FiT, not a tax.”

Given the foregoing authorities, the Tribunal would be very reluctant to adopt a different
conclusion as to the nature and substance of the Solar Levy under Czech law. In particular, the

Tribunal is not persuaded by the argument that the Czech legal system does not assign judicial

 

decisions (or decisions by courts other than the Constitutional Court) erga omnes effect or
recognise them as sources of law.*"° That is not uncommon in civil law jurisdictions. More
importantly, as the Respondent’s expert conceded at the Hearing, the formal status and effect is
in no way indicative of the interpretative authority that Supreme Administrative Court judgments
have in the Czech domestic legal system: “Although the decisions of the Supreme Administrative
Court are not considered a formal source of law in the Czech Republic, as a civil law country
which does not have the system of court precedents, an established and long-term adjudicator,
which means case law, is usually considered to be an interpretative guide which may have a

2311

relatively high level of authority.
The Tribunal considers that for the characterization of the Solar Levy in the Czech legal order,

Czech judicial decisions, including those of the Supreme Administrative Court, offer the best

available guidance, and it therefore attaches particular weight to them.

The Tribunal draws further comfort in reaching this conclusion from the fact that the Respondent

itself contended, through its Ministry of Finance, that the Solar Levy was not a tax in proceedings

The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s argument that the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision
came in a “single-paragraph obiter statement.” On the contrary, as Respondent’s expert acknowledged in
cross-examination, this element of the Court’s decision was both necessary to its holding and was
elaborated upon in several points in the Court’s judgment (Hearing Transcript (1 March 2017), 163:22-

before the Czech courts. In particular, the Czech Finance Ministry argued before the Czech
Constitutional Court that the Solar Levy was “aimed to decrease the economic feed-in tariffs” *!*
and that “from the material perspective, the introduced measures [including the Solar Levy] are
considered a reduction of subsidy”? In the Tribunal’s view, these characterizations are entirely
consistent with the Supreme Administrative Court’s 10 July 2014 decision that the Solar Levy

was a de facto reduction of the FiTs, rather than a tax.

The Tribunal is not convinced that it should attach comparable weight to the various decisions
on which the Respondent relies to argue that the Solar Levy was a tax under Czech law. These
judicial decisions focus on determining whether or not the Solar Levy is governed by the
procedural and administrative provisions of the TAL and that it complies with the requirements
of Article 11(5) of the Charter.*" It is undisputed that the TAL’s definition of “tax” applies to a
broad variety of public charges, including administrative fees, fines and other charges which are
not commonly considered taxes under Czech law.*! It is also undisputed that Article 11(5) of
the Charter is applicable not only to taxes, but also to fees.*"” In light of the foregoing, in the
Tribunal’s view, these authorities only demonstrate that the Solar Levy was established in
compliance with the Charter’s legal constraints and administered in accordance with the TAL’s
procedural requirements, applicable to both taxes and other fees. In the Tribunal’s view, these
conclusions are certainly not dispositive of the proper characterization of the Solar Levy and they
do not diminish the persuasiveness of the Supreme Administrative Court’s 10 July 2014 decision

in the present case.

The Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Solar Levy does not constitute a tax under Czech
law primarily on the basis of the Czech judicial decisions addressing its characterization. The
Tribunal shares the Respondent’s view that, in these particular circumstances, “[a]cademic
literature [...] cannot be determinative as to whether a particular measure is legally a tax.”>!’ The
academic literature which addresses the nature and substance of the Solar Levy under Czech Law
and which is relied on by the Parties fails to engage with a number of the above referenced judicial
decisions. *'* In these circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it should attach decisive
weight to any of the academic commentary in the record, or that any of this commentary displaces

the Supreme Administrative Court’s characterization of the Solar Levy.

In summary, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent has discharged its burden of
proving that the Solar Levy was characterized as a tax under Czech law. In its view, the weight
of the evidence is that the Solar Levy was regarded as something other than a tax and was not
supportive of a conclusion that it was a measure to which the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT

is applicable.

Second, and independently, the Tribunal is also not persuaded that the Solar Levy is a tax or

taxation measure within the limits contemplated by Article 21 of the ECT.

As discussed above, Article 21 excludes specified tax measures from the scope of the ECT, but
only in so far as that measure is characterized as a tax measure under the domestic law of the
State invoking the ECT’s tax carve-out. Unless a measure is regarded as a tax measure by the
State which has enacted it, and which relies upon it under Article 21, neither the text nor object

and purpose of Article 21 are satisfied.

In addition, however, the Tribunal also concludes that a measure characterized as a taxation
measure by a Contracting Party will only be excluded from the scope of the ECT, if it falls within
the limits of legitimate regulatory measures provided by Article 21 of the ECT itself (as well as
customary international law).*!? In this regard, Article 21 imposes implicit limits on those
measures which may be invoked by a Contracting Party under the ECT’s tax carve-out.
Accepting the existence of international limits on the Contracting Parties’ right to exclude

taxation measures from certain provisions of the ECT does not strip the Contracting Parties from

one of their “most quintessential sovereign powers.” Instead, it acknowledges that any
sovereign prerogative has its limits, which are, in the present case, imposed by the text and
purposes of Article 21 of the ECT. The Contracting Parties are, of course, free to make use of
their regulatory power and adopt measures in fiscal matters. They are, however, limited in their

right to invoke such measures under the ECT.

A contrary conclusion, that is, finding that the definition of tax measures in Article 21 of the ECT
was not subject to any inherent limits, would empower Contracting Parties to define unilaterally
which measures fall within the ECT’s protective scope. The Tribunal does not consider that the
drafters of Article 21 intended such a result. Moreover, this would contravene the object and
purpose of the ECT, which is to establish uniform standards among the Contracting Parties. This
is an aim to which Article 21 is clearly intended to be an exception, since its scope is specifically
limited to tax measures. The Tribunal is persuaded that Article 21 imposes international limits

on what may constitute a tax measure for these purposes.

Article 21’s limits are necessarily implied as the provision itself does not set out an explicit
international definition of “Taxation measures.” There is, however, no need for the Tribunal to
provide a comprehensive definition. It suffices for the Tribunal to address the facets of Article

21’s limits, which it considers relevant in the present case.

In the Tribunal’s view, Article 21 was not intended to exclude from the ECT’s scope measures
the main objective of which was other than that of the raising of general revenue for the State,*?!
and which were formulated and structured as taxation measures for a particular ulterior reason

(such as, here, reducing the risk of legal challenges).

Although not dependent upon a finding of bad faith, this conclusion is consistent with the
principle that treaty obligations must be interpreted, and performed, in good faith”? The Tribunal
shares the view that: “The principle of good faith has long been recognized in public international
law, as it is also in all national legal systems. This principle requires parties ‘to deal honestly and

fairly with each other, to represent their motives and purposes truthfully, and to refrain from

taking unfair advantage ...’ Nobody shall abuse the rights granted by treaties, and more generally,

every rule of law includes an implied clause that it should not be abused.”***

The Tribunal considers these principles particularly significant under the ECT. The purpose of
the ECT was to “promote long-term cooperation in the energy field”* and the treaty was
designed to promote transparency, fairness and stability. These considerations underscore the
importance of good faith in the application of Article 21 to a Contracting Party’s regulatory

measures.

In light of these principles, the Tribunal takes the view that the Solar Levy falls outside the scope
of Article 21 of the ECT. The Tribunal attaches particular weight to statements made at the time
of the enactment of the Solar Levy, which clearly evidence that the Solar Levy’s main objective
was to reduce FiTs payable to certain solar energy producers, and not the general raising of state
revenue. Importantly, these statements also evidence that the Solar Levy was structured, in many
respects, as a tax for a particular reason, namely to avoid claims against the Czech Republic under

the ECT. By way of example:

(a) 23 September 2010 Emergency Coordination Committee: “More stringent measures
that would put the support of RES, and especially PVPP to an end” gave rise to a “risk
of arbitration”; Committee charged with deciding “whether legal analysis of potential
arbitrations with the assessment of risks and costs for the state budget if the proposal
for more stringent measures is passed, e.g., by adopting the change in the feed-in tariff
for RES.”

(b) 15 October 2010 Emergency Coordination Committee: “Deputy Environmental
Minister Bizkova stated that it is necessary to find a formally correct mechanism for
reduction of the support of RES from photovoltaic power plants, such that it cannot be

legally contested.”*”°

tax —is not just a retroactive correction of support. One may argue as to whether or not
this is retroactive. Nonetheless, it is a similar situation as if you changed the conditions
for investors by increasing the income tax. From the arbitration perspective, they will
strive to advocate the principle on which the support for RES has been based, i-e., their
15-year payback period [...] the rest is the question of tax regimes — this is the
responsibility of each country, and changes in tax rates should not be challenged in

arbitrations.”*"

(d) 29 November 2010 Senate Session: “I would like to say that, explicitly, when it comes
to the relation of taxes in contracts, in agreement on the protection and support of
investments respectively, there is usually the clause explicitly exempting the tax issues

The Tribunal accepts that one purpose of the Solar Levy was to raise revenue for the State (to
finance the subsidies to solar energy producers).*** Most importantly, however, the Solar Levy
was structured to adjust the level of the FiT payable to certain renewable energy producers rather
than to raise revenue. This is evidenced, in the Tribunal’s view, by the unusually narrow class of
persons subject to the Solar Levy; the method of calculating the Solar Levy; and the possibility
that the Solar levy could not only be paid quarterly by the solar energy producers, but could also

be withheld from the FiTs paid to those producers.

Despite this, the Solar Levy was structured, in a number of respects, to resemble a tax; as the

Respondent correctly observes, the Solar Levy did not formally reduce the FiT, was imposed
(like many taxes) on a specified base with specified rates and was collected pursuant to the TAL.
In the Tribunal’s view, however, the main reason for these characteristics, as evidenced by the
statements quoted above, was an effort to bring the Solar Levy within the scope of Article 21 and

thereby avoid the restrictions of the ECT.

The Tribunal again notes the 10 July 2014 decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court,
and the submissions of the Czech Ministry of Finance to the Czech Constitutional Court,
concluding that the Solar Levy was a de facto reduction of the FiTs payable to certain renewable
energy producers. In the Tribunal’s view, the Supreme Administrative Court’s analysis is
persuasive: for the reasons outlined above, the main focus of the Solar Levy was the reduction of
certain FiTs, as evidenced by both the measure’s structure and the parliamentary statements made

in connection with its enactment.

The Tribunal emphasizes that this case does not involve conduct comparable to that in
RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation, and Quasar de Valores v. The Russian
Federation. There is no suggestion that the Respondent used its tax authority to target political
opponents, to seize control of major economic enterprises or to accomplish objectives unrelated
to fiscal and budgetary issues. The Respondent’s conduct here is simply not of the same character,

and it did not act abusively, duplicitously or with similar bad faith.

Having said this, as discussed above, the nature and objectives of the Solar Levy are such that it
does not fall within the definition of a tax measure under Article 21. As its structure and
legislative history make clear, the Solar Levy was not designed primarily to raise revenue, but
instead to reduce the FiTs for a specific set of renewable energy producers, with the Solar Levy
being structured, in many respects, as a tax in an attempt to reduce the risk of legal challenges.
This was not the purpose of the ECT. If the Solar Levy were to be exempted from the scope of
the ECT, the treaty’s object and purposes would be materially frustrated.

WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN EU INVESTORS AND
EU MEMBER STATES

On 6 March 2018, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“ECJ” or
“CJEU”) rendered its judgment in Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV.** In the operative part of the
judgment, the ECJ ruled that:

judgment”).

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the
Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which
an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning
investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State
before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept."

Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) provides:

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary
rulings concerning:
(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;
(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal ofa Member State, that court
or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to
give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a
Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law,
that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State
with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act
with the minimum of delay.

Article 344 of the TFEU reads:

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for
therein,

The Parties disagree on the impact of the Achmea judgment on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The
Respondent argues that the Tribunal “has no jurisdiction to hear the captioned matters because
the [Respondent’s] consent to arbitration under the relevant treaties is ineffective under
applicable EU law, as conclusively determined in the Achmea Judgment.”** The Claimant

contends that “the Achmea judgment does not affect [the Tribunal’s] jurisdiction.”**°

In particular, the Tribunal invited submissions from the Parties on the following issues:
1. Whether the Achmea judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that

was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the
present proceedings;

1. Whether the Achmea judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that
was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the
present proceedings

(a) The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, the Achmea judgment is not limited to the specific wording of
Article 8 of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republi lands BIT (“CSFR. land:

 

 

BIT”) at issue before the ECJ, but extends to similar provisions in other investment treaties,
including the ECT.*” This is because the question answered by the ECJ in Achmea “was worded
to cover, in a general manner, investor-State provisions ‘in a bilateral investment protection

agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT).””**

In addition, the Respondent notes that the wording of Achmea applies to “(i) ‘any provision in an
international agreement’ (ii) ‘concluded between EU Member States’ (iii) ‘under which an
investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments
in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal.”*° As Article 26 of the ECT fulfils these criteria, the Achmea judgment is also

applicable to this case.

In the ’s submission, the “provisions at issue in this p ing also are squarely
captured by the ECJ’s underlying ratio decidendi” in Achmea.™” Specifically, the Respondent
takes the view that the need to protect the effectiveness of EU law by disallowing “any
‘outsourcing’ to non-EU judicial fora of disputes that are capable of pertaining — even potentially
— to regulatory and legislative powers of the EU and its Member States in matters coming within
the scope of EU law” applies to any arbitration clauses similar to Article 8 of the CSFR-
Netherlands BIT. *! Such clauses undermine the autonomy of EU law, because (1) the disputes
which the tribunal in question is called on to resolve “are liable to relate to the interpretation or
application of EU law”; (2) the tribunal is not “situated within the judicial system of the EU,”
and, in particular, cannot “be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the
meaning of Article 267 TFEU”; and (3) an award made by such a tribunal is not “subject to
review by a court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal
may have to address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary
ruling.”

The Respondent thus argues that Article 26 of the ECT is equally incompatible with EU law as
it may also require the Tribunal to interpret or apply EU law in resolving the dispute.“ The
Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that EU law would not be relevant to the present
dispute, because the treaty does not contain an express choice of law provision. ** The
Respondent highlights that the treaty is not a “self-contained legal framework, isolated from

345

international and domestic law”*” and that the Tribunal has to decide the dispute on the basis of

all relevant rules of international law, including the TFEU.*“°

In addition, the Tribunal is not “a court or tribunal of a Member State” and as a result cannot

refer a question concerning the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ.*” The Tribunal’s award will

be final and sufficient judicial remedies against a potential breach of EU law will not be
available.*“* This is especially true in this proceeding, which is seated in Switzerland and,

therefore, outside the EU”

According to the Respondent, the aptness of a broad reading of the Achmea judgment is

confirmed in the Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet and in the academic literature. *°°

The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s argument that this Tribunal should disregard the
ECJ’s treaty interpretation in Achmea in favour of an interpretation that is in line with
international law principles of treaty interpretation and rely on “better reasoned” **! parts of the

Opinion of the Advocate General Wathelet.**?

The Respondent concludes that the Achmea judgment “is not dependent on the specific wording
of the CSFR-Netherlands BIT [and] applies with equal force” to this arbitration,**° and that “there

can be no doubt that the BIT’s dispute resolution clause [is] in conflict with the TFEU.”***

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant summarizes its position as follows:

The Achmea judgment concerned a BIT, the CSFR-Netherlands BIT, under which EU
law was applicable law pursuant to its choice-of-law clause. Unlike that BIT, the BITs
invoked by the Claimants do not contain any such clause.355

For the Claimant, the Achmea judgment only applies to instances in which a tribunal may have
to decide on substantive issues of EU law. In contrast, in the present dispute, EU law is not part

of the applicable law. Therefore, an interpretation of EU law by the Tribunal “cannot have the

effect of ip ising the effectiveness of EU law”, especiall i that the Tribunal is

seated outside of the EU. *°°

The Claimant stresses that the present dispute cannot be decided on the basis of EU law. Since
the ECT “dofes] not refer to it, either directly or indirectly”, EU law does not qualify as
“customary international law and general principles of law” forming the lex generalis of the
dispute. **’ For the Claimant, EU law is only relevant in the present dispute as a rule of
interpretation under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.** The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s
argument that, even in the absence of an express choice of law clause, EU law may still form part

of the applicable international law. *?

The Claimant further argues that the Achmea judgment is “deeply flawed” since the ECJ “fails
to consider the basic international law principles of treaty interpretation, and in particular the one
of ‘systemic integration’ embedded in Article 31(3)(c) VCLT”* Therefore, according to the
Claimant, no authority can be accorded to the ECJ’s conclusion that intra-EU BITs conflict with
EU law.*" In particular, the ECJ’s holding in Achmea is incorrectly based on the potential, rather
than on the actual, application of EU law on the part of the Tribunal,” Additionally, the ECJ
wrongly affirmed that the Achmea tribunal would have been unable to request a preliminary
ruling from the ECJ.* The ECJ in Achmea could instead have “avoided a conflict of norms by
recognizing that intra-EU BIT tribunals qualify as courts or tribunals of EU Member States under
Article 267 TFEU.”* In any event, no interpretation of EU law arises out of this dispute that
could be referred to the ECJ, as the issue of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is a matter of
international law. *® Finally, the ECJ’s reasoning concerning “the alleged limited review of intra-
EU BIT awards under national law and on a supposed distinction with commercial arbitration”

is flawed, as the principle of party autonomy is the basis of both investment treaty and

commercial arbitration.*°°

The Claimant emphasises that the Tribunal is not asked to “second-guess the Court”, but rather
to “ensure that the relation between EU law and international treaties is viewed not through the
prism of the primacy of EU law but under general international law, which does not endorse such
primacy”.*”’ According to the Claimant, it follows that Articles 344 and 267 TEFU, on their

ordinary meaning, do not prohibit investor-State arbitration.

In any case, the Clamant submits that “even if EU law were applicable law under the [ECT] (quod
non), it would only be so in relation to merit issues.”*** The Claimant argues that the alleged
conflict between EU law and investment treaties is one of jurisdiction, connected to states’
consent to arbitration.* As the Tribunal’s jurisdiction derives from the ECT, which does not
refers explicitly to EU law, the Tribunal is not bound by the Achmea judgment. In the absence of
“a clear positive rule of EU law prohibiting arbitration between an EU Member State and a
national of another EU Member State”,?”° the Tribunal should decide whether a conflict between

the ECT and EU law exists only on the basis of international law.”

2. Whether and how the Achmea judgment applies in arbitrations where the arbitral
seat is outside of the EU, including in particular the impact, if any, of Article 344
TFEU on the validity of an intra-EU BIT jurisdiction clause for an arbitral tribunal
sitting outside of the EU

(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the seat of arbitration and the procedural law under which the
arbitration is conducted are irrelevant to the application of the Achmea judgment.*” This is so,
because Article 344 of the TFEU prohibits EU Member States from submitting a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of EU law to any external dispute settlement entities,
regardless of the latter’s governing procedural law. According to the Respondent, to interpret

the Achmea judgment otherwise would be contrary to its clear language and its purpose to ensure

the effectiveness of EU law.”

The Respondent notes that the ECJ decided that arbitral proceedings lack adequate safeguards to
ensure the “full effectiveness of EU law”, notwithstanding the fact that the arbitration giving rise
to the Achmea judgment had its seat in Germany, an EU Member State. This reasoning, so argues
the Respondent, applies a fortiori to this arbitration, in which the Tribunal’s award will be subject

to review by the courts of a non-EU country (i.e., Switzerland).

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant notes that the arguments elaborated in its answer to Question 1 “are even more
pertinent, because the seat of these arbitrations is in Switzerland, outside the EU.” From the Swiss
law perspective, EU law is res inter alios acta and in no way can be accorded primacy over
international law. Under Swiss international arbitration law, the Achmea judgment is irrelevant
to assess the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.”>”° According to the Claimant, the ECJ in Achmea
recognizes that the principle of effectiveness of EU law is limited to the territory of EU Member

States.*””

3. Whether and how the Achmea judgment applies to the Energy Charter Treaty
(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Achmea judgment applies to proceedings under the ECT,

because EU law forms part of the applicable law under the ECT.*¥

According to the Respondent, the term “international agreements concluded between [EU]
Member States” in the operative part of the Achmea judgment “encompasses agreements reached
between Member States within a multilateral framework (such as the ECT) which includes non-
Member States as their Parties.”*”” The ECJ intended its reasoning to apply also to multilateral
treaties “to the extent such agreements apply within the EU and do not affect [...] third States”
rights”. **° This conclusion is said to be confirmed by the fact that, in Achmea, the ECJ

intentionally reformulated the question put to it by the German Bundesgerichtshof from one

concerning a “bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States,”**! to one

concerning “international agreement[s] concluded between Member States” in general.***

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the ECT differs from intra-EU BITs
because the EU is a contracting party to it. Specifically, the Respondent notes that, as also
confirmed in the Mox Plant decision in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (“UNCLOS”), Article 344 TFEU “applies squarely” to multilateral treaties to which the
EU is a party.**’ For the Respondent, a treaty involving the EU as a contracting party poses a
greater threat to the autonomy of EU law than treaties not involving the EU, because such treaty
becomes part of EU law.*™* Therefore (1) “any dispute about the interpretation and application of
the ECT within EU Member States automatically constitutes a dispute about the interpretation
and application of EU law”; (2) “the ECT cannot be applied as between EU Member States to
the extent it is contrary to the EU Treaties”; and (3) “in accordance with Article 344 of the TFEU,
EU Member States may not submit disputes concerning the ECT to non-EU dispute resolution

bodies.”**°

Additionally, the Respondent notes that Article 26 of the ECT shares the same characteristics as
Article 8 of the CSFR-Netherlands BIT. On this basis, it rejects the Claimant’s contention that

the situation in this arbitration is different from that found in Achmea.*°
Further, the Respondent argues that the dictum in the Achmea judgment, which states that:

It is true that, according to settle-cased law of the Court, an international agreement
providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its
provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of
Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the
field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements
necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or
designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their

provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected [...]°7

is concerned only with “the possibility for the EU to subject itself to non-EU jurisdictions” ***
Hence, it does not apply to this arbitration, which concerns a dispute settlement mechanism

included in an agreement concluded between EU Member States.**”

The Respondent concludes that this Tribunal is bound to apply Article 351(1) of the TFEU,
pursuant to which Member States’ obligations under EU Treaties prevail over any conflicting
obligations in force between the Member States under other multilateral treaties.” This is in line
with the international law principle of pacta sunt servanda.*”' In this regard, the Respondent
suggests that the Tribunal follow the analysis of the tribunal in Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic
of Hungary — which found that, in case of incompatibility, EU law previails over the ECT’s
substantive protections —, and disregard the reasoning in Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A.
v. Kingdom of Spain — which held that Achmea does not apply to multilateral treaties such as the

ECT. For the Respondent, Masdar lacks “any analysis of relevant EU law”.

It is the Respondent's position that the applicability of Article 351 of the TFEU is not affected
by Article 16 of the ECT, which provides that ECT provisions “more favorable to the investor”
prevail over other treaties. The accession of the Czech Republic to the EU in 2004 pre-empted
incompatible previous agreements and their conflict clauses. Nor can Article 16 of the ECT
prevail over Article 351 of the TFEU as lex specialis, because the principle of primacy plays such
a central role in the legal system of the EU that it would be “manifestly absurd [and]
unreasonable” to assume that EU Member States would have “deliberately signed [it] away” by

304

joining the ECT.

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal must base its decision on international law rather than on
EU law.** Questions of jurisdiction in ECT proceedings can only be decided on the basis of the
ECT’s terms and they do not give priority to EU law over the ECT. *° In the absence of a choice
of law clause providing for the applicability of EU law to this dispute, any jurisdictional conflict

between EU law and the ECT must therefore be resolved in favor of the ECT.*”

Relying on Masdar and the Decision on the Achmea Issue in Vattenfall AB et al. v. Federal
Republic of Germany, the Claimant observes that Article 26(6) ECT only governs “the
substantive standards of protection, and not the provisions on dispute resolution, Article 26(6)
applies exclusively to the merits of ECT disputes and not to jurisdiction”.**

Even if there was a relevant conflict between EU law and the ECT, such conflict should be
resolved on the basis of Article 16 ECT, providing that “the ECT’s provisions more favorable to
the investor prevail over those of other (prior or subsequent) treaties”, rather than on the basis of
Article 351 of the TFEU.*” The Claimant contends that the prevalence of Article 16 ECT over
Article 351 TFEU is confirmed by all tribunals that have dealt with the issue, save for the tribunal

in Electrabel.*

The Claimant further submits that a “good faith interpretation of the instruments in question

cannot support the conclusion that the ECT does not give rise to inter se obligations among EU

Member States, including in relation to investor-state arbitration.”“"'

According to the Claimant, the principle of harmonious interpretation is even more pertinent in
relation to the ECT, because the EU is itself a contracting party to this treaty, and this leads to

the presumption that “the EU intended to enter into obligations consistent with EU law."

Citing Masdar, the Claimant highlights that “the Achmea judgment does not consider, and
therefore does not even purport to be relevant for, multilateral treaties like the ECT, to which the
EU itself is a party.“ Further, the Claimant notes that the ECJ never mentions the ECT in

Achmea.* For the Claimant, the ECJ’s “silence speaks volumes”.*°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that the reference to “international agreements
between Member States” in Achmea includes the ECT as inconsistent with ECJ jurisprudence,

which distinguishes between intra-EU agreements and agreements with third states.‘°°

The Claimant also disagrees with the Respondent’s argument that Article 344 of the TFEU
applies to the ECT based on the Mox Plant judgment, where the ECJ found Ireland in breach of
EU law for having sued the United Kingdom before an arbitral tribunal. “”’ Such reference to Mox
Plant is inapposite, not only because the ECT does not include a disconnection clause (as, in
contrast, UNCLOS does), but also because, unlike Ireland, the Claimant is not asking the Tribunal

to apply or interpret EU law.*

4. Whether and how the Achmea judgment actually impacts upon the jurisdiction of an
arbitral tribunal sitting outside of the EU, as distinct from the enforceability of
awards within the EU

(a) The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the ECJ’s interpretation of the EU Treaties “do[es] not create, but

clarify existing EU law [and] therefore take[s] effect from the date on which the relevant State

has become bound by” the instruments at issue.“ Thus, as the Achmea judgment makes clear
that the investment arbitration clauses in intra-EU investment treaties are incompatible with EU
law and therefore inapplicable as between EU Member States, the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction to hear any claims submitted after the Czech Republic’s accession to the TFEU on
1 May 2004.*"° In this regard, the Respondent notes that “[tJhis is a separate issue from the

enforcement of the award either inside or outside the EU.”""!

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that “[t]he Achmea judgment does not impact on the jurisdiction of a
Swiss-seated tribunal. The potential unenforceability of this Tribunal’s award within the EU is

irrelevant for jurisdiction under Swiss law.”

5. How the Achmea judgment fits in, if at all, with Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties

(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that Article 59 of the VCLT is of no relevance to this case, because the
Achmea judgment concerns specific provisions of intra-EU investment treaties and not the
treaties as a whole.‘

In contrast, Article 30 of the VCLT, which codifies the principle of /ex posterior, is “perfectly
consistent” with the Achmea judgment. Unlike Article 59, Article 30 of the VCLT applies to
specific treaty provisions, i.e., those enabling investment arbitration, and not the treaty as a
whole.‘ The Respondent also notes that the “same subject matter” requirement in Article 30
VCLT “should not [...] be interpreted restrictively or applied at the level of the treaty as a

whole.”!5 Instead, it should be deemed satisfied when “(i) a certain course of conduct attracts

the application of two different treaties and; (ii) the fulfillment of an obligation under one treaty
affects the fulfillment of obligations under, or undermines the object and purpose of, the other

treaty”,“"°

According to the Respondent, this is presently the case:*!” as both investment treaties
and the EU Treaties are concerned with intra-EU investment activities, it can reasonably be
expected that issues of EU law will arise in investor-State arbitration.“ The applicability of
Article 30 of the VCLT thus ensures the prevalence of the later treaty, the TFEU, over the earlier

investment treaty.

In any event, the residual nature of Article 30 of the VCLT paves the way to the application of
more specific conflict rules, such as Article 351 of the TFEU, as relevant /ex posterior.“ In
particular, Article 351 of the TFEU prevails over both the /ex posterior principle, codified in
Article 30 of the VCLT, and the /ex specialis principle invoked by the Claimant, which the
Respondent both regards as “default rules [inapplicable] in case a different conflict rule is
applicable between the Parties.”“”° In this regard, the Respondent notes that Article 351 of the
TFEU is of “general scope and applies to all international agreements which may impact on the
application of EU law, irrespective of subject matter”."! Moreover, the Respondent argues that
Article 351 of the TFEU is a conflict of laws rule binding on all EU Member States, including

the Czech Republic, and thus represents part of the law applicable to the present dispute.“

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the ECT should be given precedence over
EU law as /ex specialis.*”* In particular, the Respondent argues that investment treaties and EU
law lack “otherness”, which is necessary for the application of the /ex specialis principle. Instead,
the two regimes constitute “part and parcel of the same European legal regime that was intended

to increase economic integration and prosperity in Europe.”

The Respondent concludes that both Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the VCLT render

the investor-State arbitration provisions in this p aaa

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that “Articles 59 and 30 VCLT are not applicable for the resolution of the

(apparent) conflict at issue, because the treaties invoked by the Claimant and the EU Treaties do

not have the same ‘subject matter’.”"** In support of its position, the Claimant cites previous

awards holding that investment treaties:

(i) have a different and more specific objective than the EU Treaties, i.e. to protect foreign
investors and investments, (ii) provide broader substantive protection non-equivalent to
that available under the EU Treaties, for instance with reference to the FET standard, and
(iii) provide a fundamental procedural protection, i.e. investor-state arbitration, with no
parallel in the EU Treaties.”

The Claimant puts special emphasis on the analogous conclusions reached by the tribunal in
Marfin Investment Group Holdings S.A., Alexandros Bakatselos and others v. Republic of
Cyprus, which rejected the relevance of the Achmea judgment to its jurisdiction “on the ground
that Article 30(3) VCLT could not apply for lack of the same subject matter requirement.”“?”

The Claimant argues that the “same subject matter” consideration under Articles 59 and 30 of the
VCLT “must be construed strictly, as requiring the ‘same level of generality’ between treaties”.°*
The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s position that investment treaties should be considered as
part of the EU legal regime.*” Instead, it argues that investment treaties “generate a specific
regime of international law” which gives investors access to a specific set of protection of the

host State “foreign to the “European law regime””.**° Therefore, “[a]ny hypothetical conflict

between the [ECT] and EU law must be resolved in favour of the [ECT]. *! This follows from
the /ex specialis rule as well as from the Tribunal’s obligation to give precedence to the sub-
regime to which it belongs in the event that another sub-regime, in this case EU law, claims

absolute superiority.

For the Claimant, the Respondent also wrongly invokes Article 351 of the TFEU. *” First, the
Claimant argues that, even if Article 351 of the TFEU was a special conflict rule, it would not
apply to the present dispute because EU law does not form part of the applicable law.‘ Second,
the Claimant contends that the Tribunal need not rely on Article 351 of the TFEU, since the

provision only applies to States, i.e., not in relation to foreign investors and host States.“

6. The relevance of Articles 27 and 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
for the present arbitrations

(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that Articles 27 and 46 VCLT are of no relevance in this case, as the
Respondent is not invoking its internal law to justify its position, but rather “a fundamental
incompatibility between successive international treaties [...] between the same contracting
parties” in accordance with Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the VCLT.**

In particular, the Respondent argues that the broad scope of EU law obligations, which also
include “doctrines developed by the ECJ, such as primacy, direct effect, effectiveness” does not
transform the law created by EU treaties into national law.*° The Respondent highlights that the

Claimant itself confirmed in its submission on Achmea the international nature of EU law.**”

(b) The Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT are applicable in this case:

[Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT] prohibit the Czech Republic from relying on EU law,
qua domestic law, in order to escape its treaty obligations. In fact, EU law, despite its
international character, is deeply integrated into the domestic law of the Czech Republic,
of which it is an integral part.

On this point, the Claimant contends that EU law can be characterized as either international or
national law. Its national law character stems from the fact that “EU law gives rise to a special
legal order deeply integrated into the one of its Member States.” Therefore, “for the purposes

of Articles 27 and 46 VCLT, internal law includes [supranational] EC law."

The Claimant thus holds that the Respondent's position that “‘the “integration of the [...] TFEU
into domestic legal systems is no ‘deeper’ than that of any other treaty-based international law’

ignores the special features of EU law that make it a sub-regime of international law”, “"' in

particular “its primacy over, and direct effect on, the Member States’ internal laws.”

7. How Swiss courts and Swiss scholarship have considered the position of EU law in a
legal universe consisting of international law and domestic law
(a) The Respondent’s Position
According to the Respondent, EU law is considered by Switzerland, which is not an EU Member
State, as “public international law between third countries (res inter alios acta). Nevertheless,
given its close relationship with the EU, “EU law also plays an extremely significant role in the
Swiss legal system.” “4 For instance, more than one hundred international treaties that

Switzerland concluded with the EU became part of Swiss domestic law once ratified. ““*

of Swi

 

d,“"” and is

domestic law and EU law is thus necessary to ensure a level playing fiel
actively pursued by Switzerland’s judicial and government institutions.“* The Respondent
concludes that “a consistent interpretation of the State’s obligations under EU law — one of the
driving principles of the Achmea judgment — is thus a recognized public interest in
Switzerland.”

Regarding the applicability of EU law in Swiss arbitral proceedings, the Respondent discusses a
decision of the Swiss Federal Tribunal concerning the role of EU competition law in Swiss-seated
arbitration on “whether a Swiss arbitral tribunal was obliged to consider the validity of the
disputed contract under Article 101 of the TFEU, which prohibits anti-competitive
agreements.”**" The Respondent notes that the ECJ has decided in Eco Swiss v. Benetton
International that EU competition law (i.e., Article 101 of the TFEU) is “a matter of EU public

policy to be applied by commercial arbitral tribunals”.**!

According to the Respondent, the Swiss Federal Tribunal decided that fundamental provisions of
EU competition law constitute relevant public policy considerations.*” As a result, a Swiss-
seated arbitral tribunal must take these provisions into account, notwithstanding the fact that

453

Swiss law is the governing law of the contract.*“’ Otherwise, the award would be susceptible to

annulment by reason of the tribunal’s failure to apply the applicable law in accordance with

(“PILA”).** In determining the content of the relevant EU law, the Respondent asserts that the

Swiss Federal Tribunal follows the decision of the ECJ.“*

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant’s response to this question is as follows:

From the Swiss law perspective, EU law is res inter alios acta, and Switzerland has no
interest in ensuring, through Swiss courts, its general harmonization or consistent
application, any more than it has an interest in supporting the policy of other States.
Instead, customary international law and general principles of law are part of Swiss law
as international law within the meaning of Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution, and
preclude giving primacy to EU law.

According to the Claimant, Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution provides that the Swiss
Confederation and the Swiss cantons have to comply with international law norms that are
binding upon Switzerland. Those norms do not include EU law, as Switzerland is not an EU
Member State.** The fact that Switzerland has entered into several bilateral agreements with the
EU, and that it has unilaterally enacted domestic laws based on EU law, does not “give EU law
a special status in Swiss law.”“*’ That said, the Claimant acknowledges that “interpretation [of
Swiss law] in harmony with EU law has been understandably considered preferable where
possible”,*** as long as it would serve Switzerland’s own economic interests in terms of its
nationals’ competitiveness within the EU market.” Accordingly, the Claimant submits that, in
general, “Switzerland takes no stance towards the general harmonization of EU law [as it is] not

a policy concern for Switzerland.’*°

In sum, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s position that the Tribunal must apply
mandatory EU law, lest its award may be set aside, is wrong for two reasons.**! First, pursuant

to Article 19 of the PILA, “there is no basis for the assertion that an arbitral tribunal seated in

Switzerland is obliged to apply foreign mandatory rules.“ Second, “it is undisputed that the

failure of a Swi:

 

ated tribunal to apply such rules, or to apply them correctly, is not a ground

for setting aside an award pursuant to Article 190(2)(b)”.“

8. The impact, if any, of Article 177(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private
International Law

Article 177(2) of the PILA provides:

Ifa party to the arbitration agreement is a state or an enterprise or organization controlled
by it, it cannot rely on its own law in order to contest its capacity to be a party to an
arbitration or the arbitrability of a dispute covered by the arbitration agreement.

(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent points out that the goal of Article 177(2) of the PILA “is to prevent a State from
abusing its own sovereign legislative or executive powers”.*“ The provision prohibits a State or
its organ acting as a respondent before a Swiss-seated international arbitration tribunal from
invoking its domestic law to contest the validity of the arbitration agreement on grounds of non-
arbitrability or lack of capacity. Against this background, the provision thus does not apply
“where the relevant legal change is outside a Party’s control.”“° As the Achmea judgment is not
attributable to the Respondent, Article 177(2) of the PILA is not applicable.*”

The Respondent adds that, pursuant to Article 119 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the
arbitration clause contained in the ECT should be deemed extinguished and inoperative, as the
performance of the obligation to arbitrate has become impossible due to circumstances not

attributable to the party.“*

(b) The Claimant’s Position

469

The arguments that are sought to be drawn from the Achmea judgment by the Czech
Republic relate to the “arbitrability” of the dispute. This matter is governed by Article
177(1) PILA [Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law], which denies any role
to non-Swiss law, including EU law, for arbitrability. Arbitrability is to be assessed
exclusively pursuant to Swiss law, according to which the present dispute is fully
arbitrable. As regards the arbitrability of the dispute under Swiss law, it is irrelevant that
the award to be rendered by this Tribunal may be unenforceable within EU Member
States. It follows that, from a Swiss law perspective, the Achmea judgment is completely
irrelevant.

Article 177(2) PILA prohibits a State from relying on its “own law” to contest its
“capacity to be a party to an arbitration or the arbitrability of a dispute covered by the
arbitration agreement”. In light of Article 177(1) PILA, which already deals with
arbitrability ratione materiae and applies to both private and public parties, Article 177(2)
PILA is generally considered superfluous. Be as it may, in the present case it precludes
the Czech Republic from relying on EU law, which is clearly its “own law”.4”

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s arguments are meritless. First, the relevant EU law
is “internal law” of the Respondent. Thus, the Respondent cannot argue that the Achmea
judgment is not attributable to itself.*7' As for the impossibility argument under Article 119 of
the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Claimant contends that “there is no physical impossibility to
perform the arbitration agreement”. Also, the legal impossibility under the provision does not
include the arbitrability issue, as such issue is “exclusively governed by the substantive rule of
Article 177 [of the PILA]”.4”

9 The role of waiver/estoppel, including in light of Article 186(2) of the Swiss Federal
Code on Private International Law, in this context

Article 186(2) of the PILA provides:

Any objection to [the Tribunal’s] jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defense on the
merits,

matters.”4” In cases where the subject matter of the dispute is non-arbitrable, the Respondent
contends, the failure to raise a jurisdictional objection in a timely manner does not lead to the
foreclosure of such objection and the arbitral tribunal should examine the question of arbitrability
ex officio, given that “[a] party cannot waive a right that it did not have.” According to the
Achmea judgment, which is an “expression of EU mandatory provisions”, intra-EU investor-
State disputes are objectively non-arbitrable; such non-arbitrability cannot be waived and must

therefore be considered ex officio by this Tribunal.‘”*

In any case, the Respondent cannot be considered to have waived the intra-EU Investment Treaty
jurisdictional objection because, to be effective, such waiver must be “clear and unequivocal”.1”
As the Respondent indicated in its Counter-Memorial that “it considered the intra-EU objection
to ‘raise[ ] many complex and serious jurisdictional issues,’ which are more appropriately
resolved by the ECJ”, there is no clear and unequivocal waiver.’ The Respondent adds that it
raises this jurisdictional objection in a timely manner following the issuance of the Achmea
judgment.4*

(b) The Claimant’s Position

In relation to the concepts of waiver and estoppel under international law, the Claimant submits:

The principles of waiver and estoppel, which are firmly established in international law
and are enshrined in Article 186(2) PILA, apply in this case. In addition to all the other
reasons, the Respondent’s request that these cases be dismissed on the basis of the intra-
EU jurisdictional objection should be rejected because, under both international law and
Swiss law, the Czech Republic (i) waived the right to raise such objection; and (ii) is
estopped from raising it.4””

The Claimant observes that “waiver is a well-established principle of international law which has

been consistently been applied by the ICJ”.“* A waiver is effective if it meets these conditions:

(i) there must be a declaration or statement; (ii) made by a competent authority; (iii) of
the State whose rights are affected by the waiver; (iv) made in the context of a
claim/dispute; (v) not affected by individuality; and (vi) not revocable.*!

In this regard, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s statement that it “does not raise (or
intend to raise) the intra-European Union [Investment Treaty] objection” meets these six

requirements and thus constitutes an enforceable waiver.”

In any event and separately, the Claimant contends that, pursuant to the well-established principle
of estoppel,’ the Respondent would be precluded from raising the intra-EU objection.*** The
relevant test is that “(i) the State must engage in a conduct or make a representation/declaration

good faith.”“*> Some tribunals have considered a third element, namely “a showing of detriment

As for the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s waiver and estoppel arguments do not

 

apply here, because “the Achmea judgment is the expression of EU mandatory prov:
Claimant submits that waiver and estoppel “are overriding principles of international law” in
relation to the EU law sub-regime.*** In any case, “estoppel operates irrespective of whether the

representation of [the Respondent] is legal or correct."

In respect of Article 186(2) of the PILA, the Claimant argues that it is applicable and bars the
Respondent’s “attempt to revive the intra EU-objections”. “°° In the Claimant’s view, the
Respondent “not only fail[ed] to contest the jurisdiction but expressly and unconditionally
[undertook] not to raise a jurisdictional objection.” Such behavior “falls squarely under Article
186(2)”.%"

The Respondent’s argument that Article 186(2) of the PILA does not apply to “objectively
arbitrable matters” is considered flawed by the Claimant since this limit only applied to matters
which are non-arbitrable under Swiss law.*°? According to the Claimant, the question of
arbitrability is determined by reference to the broad definition of arbitrability found in Article 177
of the PILA, which encompasses “any dispute of financial interest”. The present dispute is thus
arbitrable under Swiss law, so says the Claimant, and whether it is arbitrable under EU law is
irrelevant. °° With reference to academic commentary, the Claimant also rejects the

Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal should consider arbitrability ex officio."

10. The Tribunal’s Decision

Having carefully considered the arguments presented by both sides, the Tribunal finds itself in
agreement with the Claimant. It holds that the Achmea judgment has no impact on this Tribunal’s

proceedings.

The seat of this arbitration is Geneva, Switzerland.’”* Importantly, the Tribunal is seated outside
the EU.

It is well accepted that the seat of arbitration determines the procedural law governing the
arbitration, and will likely impose procedural rules by which all parties must comply. Equally,
the arbitration law at the seat will dictate the extent to which domestic courts will involve
themselves, or may intervene, in the arbitral process, the degree to which an arbitral award may
be affirmatively challenged (i.e., set aside or annulled) and the grounds for such a challenge. The
Tribunal therefore cannot agree with the Respondent’s submission that the seat of arbitration is
irrelevant to the Tribunal’s analysis.4% On the contrary, the Tribunal is called upon to satisfy
itself that all Parties to this arbitration have complied with all relevant legal requirements at the
seat of the arbitration throughout the arbitral process, and that there is no issue with respect of its

jurisdiction as far as its seat is concerned.

It is for this reason that the Tribunal deems it appropriate to consider both the conduct of the
Respondent in raising its jurisdictional objection based upon the Achmea judgment, and the
impact of the Achmea judgment itself on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction from the perspective of Swiss

law and the likely approach of the Swiss courts.

Under the applicable Swiss procedural law, objections to an arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction must
be brought in a timely manner. Article 186(2) of the PILA, codifying the principle of foreclosure,
specifies that “[a]ny objection to [the Tribunal’s] jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defense
on the merits.” This provision does not spell out the consequences of a failure to contest
jurisdiction before dealing with the merits, but it is generally accepted that where a respondent
enters an unconditional appearance and makes submissions on the merits, such behaviour

constitutes an irrevocable waiver of its right to contest the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction.”

Similarly, Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal

 

does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence or, with respect

to a counter-claim, in the reply to the counter-claim.”

In this case, there is nothing to which the Respondent can point to satisfy the requirement in both

Article 186(2) of the PILA and Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules that the jurisdictional
objection in question was raised no later than the statement of defence, or any defence on the
merits. Rather, as detailed below, the Respondent specifically and repeatedly stated throughout
these proceedings that it would not object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis of the intra-

EU nature of the dispute.

In the Response to the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent noted that “the Czech Republic does

not raise (or intend to raise) the intra-European Union BIT objection”.”*

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent stated that “the Czech Republic does not plead a

fundamental incompatibility between investment treaties and EU law”.“”

At the Hearing, the Respondent submitted that the “Czech Republic, as you know, does not

advance an intra-EU jurisdictional objection in this case”.

The Tribunal notes the Respondent’s contention that any waiver of rights under Article 186(2) of
the PILA, to be effective, must be expressed in “clear and unequivocal” terms.*' In this regard,
the Respondent has drawn the Tribunal’s attention to what it considers to be qualifying language
in its submissions that would make any alleged waiver neither clear nor unequivocal. For

instance, in its Counter-Memorial the Respondent noted that “’the intra-EU objection raise[d]
many complex and serious jurisdictional issues’, which are more appropriately resolved by the

ECy" 52

Having carefully reviewed each of these statements, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent.
In the Tribunal’s view, none of the Respondent’s referenced qualifications changes the nature of
its representations, and indeed undertakings, repeated at different stages throughout these
proceedings, that no jurisdictional objection would be raised with respect to the intra-EU issue
(i.e., the same issue that has now been decided in Achmea). In all the circumstances, the Tribunal
therefore concludes that the Respondent waived any intra-EU Investment Treaty jurisdictional
objection. Had the Respondent intended to reserve its rights, it could have done so by including
express language to this effect. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s waiver was “clear

and unequivocal” and therefore valid under Article 186(2) of the PILA.

There is then the question whether there is anything about the nature of the Achmea judgment

and the principle for which it stands that changes this analysis as a matter of Swiss law.

According to the Respondent, Article 186(2) of the PILA “only applies to objectively arbitrable
matters” and the Achmea judgment as an “expression of EU mandatory provisions” renders any
intra-EU dispute, including the present one, objectively non-arbitrable. In other words, the
mandatory nature of the rule of EU law identified in the Achmea judgment is such that the
Respondent is free to raise an objection based upon this rule in Swiss arbitral proceedings at any
stage, whether before, during or after defending on the merits, and without regard to the Swiss

rules on waiver.

The Tribunal does not agree. As both Parties have submitted, EU law is considered by
Switzerland as public international law between third countries (“res inter alios acta”).*”
Pursuant to Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution, the Swiss Confederation and the Cantons shall
respect international law that is binding upon them. Similarly, Article 190 of the Swiss
Constitution provides that the Swiss Supreme Court and other judicial authorities are bound to
apply international law. These references to international law comprise only those norms of
international law that are binding upon Switzerland. This includes, for example, customary
international law, the general principles of law and the treaties signed and ratified by Switzerland.
However, since Switzerland is not an EU Member State, nor a member of the European Economic
Area, it cannot be said that EU law strictly forms part of international law within the meaning of
the Swiss Constitution, or enjoys a special status or primacy over other rules of international law.
The Tribunal is unpersuaded by the Respondent’s arguments that the policy of Swiss courts to
interpret Swiss statutes in harmony with EU law or the extensive network of treaties between
Switzerland and the EU have a bearing on the status of EU law within the Swiss legal order.
While these developments may be evidence of a growing economic integration between
Switzerland and the EU, they cannot, in and of themselves, fundamentally change the legal
character of EU law in Switzerland, or indeed the fact that Swiss courts are under no obligation
to follow the ECJ’s jurisprudence. The Tribunal therefore concludes that EU law does not
enjoy primacy in Switzerland. Accordingly, the question of objective arbitrability must be

determined from the perspective of Swiss law.
The applicable Article 177(1) of the PILA provides that “[a]ny dispute of financial interest may

be the subject of an arbitration”. This is a self-sufficient substantive provision of Swiss

international arbitration law, as opposed to a conflict of laws rule.*°> As such, the Tribunal must

only apply this rule, to the exclusion of any potentially stricter foreign rules (even if closely

connected to the dispute). The Tribunal notes, in this regard, the Fincantieri judgment, in which

the Swiss Federal Tribunal upheld a partial award on jurisdiction, finding that the commercial

embargo imposed by the United Nations against Iraq did not affect the arbitrability under Swiss

law of a dispute involving an agency agreement for the conclusion of contracts with the Republic

of Iraq, and that the fact that an award rendered in Switzerland might not be enforceable in other

jurisdictions pursuant to Article V(2) of the New York Convention was not a relevant factor for
the purposes of Article 177(1) PILA.%°°

It bears mention here that there is a consensus amongst commentators on Swiss law that foreign
law has no bearing on arbitrability in Switzerland, even if it is considered part of the public policy
of the foreign system at issue — unless it is also part of Swiss international public policy within
the (restrictive) meaning of Article 190(2)(e) PILA.*” But the Tribunal has seen nothing to justify
a conclusion that the principle identified in the Achmea judgment constitutes Swiss international
public policy (as this notion has been defined). On the contrary, as the Claimant has noted,
Switzerland has signed and ratified numerous BITs with different States, including EU Member

States, providing for investor-State arbitration, and has manifested a clear pro-arbitration policy.

*°8 the Tribunal considers this of

In so far as the Respondent relies on the decision in Eco Swiss,
no assistance. This decision concerned the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, whereas
the Achmea judgment (as the Respondent itself has asserted) raises an issue of objective
arbitrability, which in this case — unlike in Eco Swis

of the PILA.

 

is governed exclusively by Article 177(1)

It follows that applying Article 177(1) of the PILA, the present dispute, which clearly involves
financial interests, is objectively arbitrable under Swiss law. Whether the dispute is also arbitrable
under EU law need not be decided by this Tribunal. More specifically, whether the award is
enforceable outside Switzerland, or within the EU, has no impact on objective arbitrability within

Switzerland.

It also follows that the Achmea judgment and the principle of EU law for which it stands cannot

have the effect of ignoring the procedural rules applicable to this Swiss arbitration.

Further, Article 177(2) of the PILA precludes a State, which is a party to an arbitration agreement,
from invoking its own law in order to contest the arbitrability of a dispute covered by such an
arbitration agreement. It applies squarely to the present arbitration. To the extent that the
Respondent argues that Article 177(2) of the PILA is not applicable in the present circumstances
as the Achmea judgment is not attributable to the Respondent, the Tribunal disagrees. EU law,
including the obligation to comply with judgments from the ECJ, forms part of the domestic legal

system of the Czech Republic.*”

In light of these considerations, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary or appropriate to
pronounce itself on the application of the Achmea judgment to an arbitration brought under the
ECT.

The Tribunal concludes that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Achmea judgment

cannot be relied upon by the Respondent. It has no impact on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The same conclusion flows from the application of Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT.

MERITS
WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
STANDARD
1. Whether the Respondent Failed to Provide a Stable Legal Framework

(a) The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant argues that the Respondent violated its obligation to accord the Claimant and its
investment fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) under the ECT by changing the legal framework

applicable to investments in the photovoltaic power plant market.*!" In the present case, the
5

Claimant submits that the obligation to provide FET is contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT. *"!

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage
and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting

Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security [...].°'”

According to the Claimant, FET is a flexible standard, breaches of which may be established by
reference to several types of host States’ conducts, which may partially overlap.*!* Such conduct
includes (1) the failure to provide a stable and predictable investment framework; and (2) the
failure to protect a foreign investor’s legitimate expectations; and (3) the failure to act in a

reasonable manner.*!*

First, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to provide a stable and predictable

framework by i the Solar Levy, ing the Income Tax Exemption, and

changing the Shortened Depreciation Period.*'*

For the Claimant, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework may

be distinguished from the obligation to protect an investor’s legitimate expectations.*'® The

former enshrines a host State’s general obligation not to change its investment framework
retroactively to the detriment of a foreign investor, while the latter requires an examination of an
individual investors’ expectations. Accordingly, the Tribunal may determine that the host State
violated the obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework “without a specific
consideration of the individual investors’ expectations.”*'’ Accordingly, the obligation to provide
a stable and predictable investment framework should be examined from an objective
perspective, regardless of whether a host State has provided a specific assurance or whether an

investor has acknowledged such a specific assurance.*!*

According to the Claimant, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment
framework stems from two sources in the present case: first, from the inherent nature of the
incentive legislation and, secondly, from the specific treaties that are presently applicable, i.e.,

the ECT.*”

First, the Claimant argues that the Act on Promotion, the relevant ERO regulations and the Act

Second, the Claimant argues that the object and purpose of the ECT is (a) to promote investments
between the Contracting States, for example, by providing a long-term incentive regime, and (b)
to require host States to protect investors from legislative changes for a reasonable period of

time.

In particular, the Claimant refers to Article 10(1) of the ECT which expressly requires host States
to “encourage and create stable [...] conditions for investors.”*** The Claimant emphasises that
this provision should be interpreted in accordance with the object and purpose of the ECT as set
out in its introductory note, namely strengthening “the rule of law” on energy matters which,

according to the Claimant, strictly prohibits retroactive regime changes.**°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that a stabilization clause would be necessary
527

to stabilize the Incentive Regime.
First, the Claimant points out that the Respondent acknowledges that the Act on Promotion
provided a promise of stabilization when it stated that investors were entitled to expect the 15-
year simple payback and the 7% return under the Act, even if the Act does not entail any specific

stabilization clause.***

Second, the Claimant argues that an express contractual stabilization clause is not necessary to
prohibit a host State from changing its investment scheme, considering that, in the RES market,
direct contracts with the Government are unusual, as RES producers typically are small
businesses and the RES electricity produced is sold directly to the network operators. *°
Accordingly, in the Claimant’s view, it is unreasonable to require a specific contractual clause to
impose an obligation on the host State to stabilize its investment regime. **” In this regard, the

Claimant notes that its position is in line with relevant regulatory practice in the RES market,

(Ex. C-23).

To support this argument, the Claimant refers to an ERO report which provides that the Act on
Promotion was “bringing a guarantee of long-term and stable promotion necessary for decision-

Republic of Poland,*” decided that the requirement of stability is fundamental to the FET

standard.“

Finally, the Claimant contends that the tribunal in Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve
Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*“ found that a mere change of a host State’s

investment policy can constitute a breach of the FET standard.*“°

The Claimant accepts the Respondent's definition of the term “retroactive”, conceding that “from
a legal perspective, a law affecting only future situations is not technically retroactive”.
Nevertheless, the Claimant maintains that the term “retroactive” should be used vis-a-vis existing
investments, stating that such language would be appropriate from a business perspective, and

that the EC used the term in the same manner in its letter of 11 January 2011.”

(b) The Respondent’s Position
The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the Respondent failed to provide a stable
and predictable investment framework by introducing the Solar Levy and repealing the Tax

Incentives.**

First, the Respondent emphasizes the presumption that a host State does not violate its treaty
obligation by simply changing its domestic law, noting that a State must be free to serve the

public interest through legislative modifications.”

Second, the Respondent criticizes the Claimant’s use of the word “retroactive”, stating that the
Claimant in substance claims that “retroactive” implies that the Respondent may not change the
future treatment of any existing investment, while the term in fact implies the withdrawal of a

treatment granted in the past.**°

Third, the Respondent alleges that a mere change of the legal framework applicable to the

Claimant’s investment does not amount to a violation of its treaty obligation to provide FET in
the absence of a specific stabilization arrangement.**' According to the Respondent, the Claimant
confuses the notion of stability with the distinct concept of stabilization, explaining that a
guarantee of stabilization prohibits a host State entirely from changing its legislation, while a
mere obligation to provide stability does not.*? Referring to the decisions in Total S.A. v.

Argentine Republic, Parkerings-Compagniet AS y. Lithuania, and Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula

and others v. Romania,” the Respondent argues that an investment treaty does not, as a general

matter, limit a State’s discretion to change or modify its national legislation unless the treaty
contains a specific stabilization provision or other specific mechanisms to this effect.** In the
Respondents view, this is particularly true in the energy sector where regulators often intervene
to address market failures such as, for example, monopolies or the abuse of market power.**
According to the Respondent, this view is shared by certain Middle and South American
countries, which enacted legislation that provides for the possibility of contractual stabilization
clauses.*° The Respondent argues that such express stabilization arrangements must clearly
stipulate that existing laws “continue to apply to the beneficiary even in the face of legislative or

regulatory change, and/or identification of a remedy in the event the beneficiary is subjected to

Noble Energy,* Oxus v. The Republic of Uzbekistan,*® Occidental and Nations Energy Inc.

On the other hand, the Respondent submits that the obligation to provide FET, in the absence of

stabilization.“ Moreover, even if an investment treaty were to use the term “stability”, the treaty
should not be interpreted as incorporating a stabilization arrangement in the absence of other

express indications.°°

In the present case, the Respondent alleges that it did not provide a guarantee of stabilization to
photovoltaic investors.** In particular, the Explanatory Report did not contain a promise of

“maintain” is not sufficient to conclude that stabilization was intended.*’ The language only
meant to indicate that the tax relief would continue even after the complete opening of the
electricity market. In contrast, the wording did not intend to stabilize the legislation.“ The
Respondent also notes that since the Explanatory Report was neither a law, regulation, nor decree,
these wordings are not binding upon the Czech Republic in any event. Similarly, the wording
“[the Act on Promotion] [...] bring[s] a guarantee of long-term and stable promotion” in the ERO

report of 2009 was not sufficient to stabilize legislation.*”

In response to the Claimant’s argument that a contractual stabilization clause is not necessary to
stabilize the legislation, since the investors in the present case were unable to enter into a
contractual relationship with the Respondent to obtain a stabilization guarantee and that it would
therefore be unreasonable to require a contractual stabilization clause, the Respondent concedes
that a stabilization clause does not always have to be a contractual provision, but can also be a
legislative arrangement. However, the conditions for such a legislative stabilization are not

fulfilled in the present case.°”!

Finally, in response to the Claimant’s allegation that the Respondent admits that the Incentive
Regime provided a promise of stabilization, the Respondent agrees that the Incentive Regime
was designed to provide a 15-year simple payback and a 7% return, but maintains that no further,

or other, promise was given.”

Accordingly, the reasonableness of a host State’s measures is irrelevant to this standard.**”
According to the Claimant, the following three-pronged test has been developed in investment

arbitration to establish whether a violation of an investor’s legitimate expectations has occurred:

“(i) The Respondent made a promise, assurance or representation of regulatory stability;

(ii) the Claimant relied on such promise, assurance or representation; and

(iii) such reliance (and expectation) was reasonable.” **

In relation to the first step, the Claimant argues that the decisive question is “whether [a host
State] acted in a manner that would reasonably be understood to create such an appearance”.**”
Conversely, the host State’s actual intent is said to be irrelevant.*” However, the Claimant agrees
with the Respondent’s view that, objectively considered, an investor’s expectations must have
been objectively legitimately formed at the time of the investment and that minor expectations
are not protected.*”! The latter restriction is immaterial in the present circumstances, however,
since according to the Claimant its expectations as to the stability of the Investment Scheme were

fundamental to its investment decision and therefore not minor.*”

Additionally, the Claimant argues that the notion of legitimate expectations is closely related to
the notion of transparency, which entails an obligation to provide information as to potential

legislative changes, noting that Article 10(1) of the ECT contains both obligations.*”*

With respect to the first limb of the above test, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent made
the following promises of regulatory stability: (1) the Tariff level would be stable for 20 years
pursuant to Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion, and the relevant ERO regulations; (2) the
Income Tax Exemption would continue to apply for six years, pursuant to Section 19(1)(d) of the
Act on Income Tax; and (3) the Shortened Depreciation Period, ranging between five to ten years,

would be available, pursuant to Section 30 of the Act on Income Tax.°%

The Claimant argues that the promised legislative stability as detailed above stems from (1) the
legislation which established the Incentive Regime; (2) the very purpose of the Incentive Regime
itself; (3) the Respondent’s promotional activities surrounding the Incentive Regime, and (4) the

particularities of the licensing process to operate the Claimant’s plants.*°

First, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent’s promise of stability is apparent, since the
Incentive Regime contained clear rules through the Act on Promotion, the 2007 Technical
Regulation, the 2009 Pricing Regulation, and the Act on Income Tax.*” With regard to the Act
on Promotion, the Claimant notes that Article 6(1)(b)(2), and the relevant provisions under the
Technical Regulation and the Pricing Regulation, established that the Tariffs would be payable
for 20 years.**” According to the Claimant, the promised stability was not limited to a 15-year
simple payback and a 7% return rate.*”* In this regard, the Claimant objects to the Respondent’s
argument that Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, which allows investors to recover
investment costs within 15 years, supersedes Article 6(1)(b)(2), arguing that Article 6(1)(b)(1) is
only meant to specify the criteria for establishing the FiT and Green Bonuses level.*” The
irrelevance of the return rate in setting FiT is supported by the fact that the ERO did not review
the return rates annually.* The Claimant emphasizes that Mr. Jones, the Respondent's industry
expert, agreed at the hearing that the 15-year simple payback would not have attracted
investments in the Czech RES market." Similarly, the WACC, as set by the ERO at 7%, was
not sufficient to achieve the 8% EU target for 2010.% In addition, the Claimant submits that a
WACC was no more than an indicative technical parameter to calculate FiT under the Technical
Regulation.’ Moreover, the Respondent’s argument ignores the importance of stability from a

business perspectives.°™

The Claimant further submits that the Act on Income Tax provided the promise of legislative

stability jointly with the Act on Promotion.%* As evidence for this, the Claimant points to the
Explanatory Report, which mentioned that the Incentive Regime is “based [...] [o]n maintaining
the tax reliefs to the extent set out in the Acts on Income Tax”. In addition, the Claimant states
that a general legal framework is likely to create legitimate expectations when it offers long-term
benefits to attract investors, adding that the legislative expectations may arise even if the legal
framework does not address individual investors.” Similarly, the Claimant states that, even if
the Shortened Depreciation Period was not specifically designed for photovoltaic energy
producers, the solar energy producers could legitimately expect that the Shortened Depreciation

Period would be stable, because it was a part of the Incentive Regime.°*

Lastly, according to the Claimant, the decision of the tribunal in Charanne B.V., Construction
Investments S.A.R.L. v. The Kingdom of Spain, which found that the claimants, who were
Spanish RES investors, could not rely on legitimate expectations, may be distinguished from the
case at hand because in Charanne the alleged guaranteed period amounted to 30-50 years, and

therefore was unreasonably longer than in the case at hand.°!”

Second the Claimant argues that it was the Incentive Regime’s purpose to create legitimate
expectations, because its ultimate goal was to help the Respondent to meet its EU targets,

especially the 8% Indicative 2010 Target under the 2001 Directive.°""

The Incentive Regime did
so by offering stable incentives to prospective investors.°'* With regard to the Tariffs, the
Claimant alleges that the Explanatory Report expresses this purpose well, providing that: “[it
was] necessary to create a support system which, given the well-known high investment costs,
will create the necessary climate for investors with a long-term guarantee of return on investments

made”.°3

Incentives”) the Claimant states that its purpose was closely related to the Act of Promotion to
jointly provide a long-term incentive scheme.°"* To support this argument, the Claimant submits
that the Explanatory Report states that “the promotion system is based [...] on maintaining the
tax reliefs to the extent set out in the Act[s] on Income Tax” to meet the EU target for the year
2010.°'* In response to the Respondent’s assertion that the 8% target was not binding, the
Claimant submits that Mr. Jones, the Respondent’s industry expert, also admitted that “[the
Czech Republic] wished to achieve the 8% [target]”.°!° In addition, the Respondent’s argument
that a significant contribution of solar energy was not expected, is at odds with a number of items
of evidence, including the ERO’s report of 2009, which provided that “[photovoltaic energy was]

of key importance for the fulfilment of the indicative target.”°"”

In the Claimant’s view, the decision of the Tribunal in PSEG,"'* which held that the legislative
purpose of a State measure in that case was insufficient to support the argument that the host
State’s government actively attracted foreign investments, may be distinguished from the present

case, as the purpose of the Incentive Regime is sufficiently clear.°"”

Contrary to what the Respondent alleges, the Claimant argues that the Explanatory Report
constitutes a sufficient basis for legitimate expectations. Although the report is not a source of
law, it is evidence of the Czech Republic’s intention to attract photovoltaic investors.”! The
Claimant further argues that the fact that the Explanatory Report does not mention the Shortened
Depreciation Period is due to the fact that the Act on Income Tax already provided a clear promise
of stability in the period.°? That the Explanatory Report does not address the Claimant
individually is also irrelevant, because individual knowledge is not necessary for legitimate

expectations to arise.°°> Moreover, the Claimant alleges that it had actual knowledge of the 2010

Action Plan, which mentioned that financial support was available to RES investments.°**

Third, the Claimant argues that the Czech Government and the ERO officials launched an intense
marketing campaign to promote the FiT and the Green Bonuses offered under the Act on

Promotion, submitting several examples of this campaign. °°

As emphasized by the Claimant, Mr. Pavel Koutny (the Claimant’s CFO), explains that the
ERO’s presentations, such as the one dated on 18 September 2009, strengthened the Claimant’s

understanding that the Incentive Regime would be stable for 20 years.°°°

As further evidence for this, the Claimant submits that the 2010 Action Plan did not provide for
a cap on the total volume of electricity for the Tariff, and that the plan forecasted a significant

rise of photovoltaic installations for the year 2010.”

With respect to the fact that the Respondent did not advertise the Tax Incentives together with
the Act on Promotion, the Claimant explains that it was merely because the Respondent promoted

only the new portion of the Incentive Regime.°**

Fourth, the Claimant argues that the complex licensing process for the construction and operation
of photovoltaic installations turned the Respondent’s general promises into specific promises.”°
The Claimant explains that it completed the licensing process before becoming aware of the risk
of retroactive change and that the licensing process played an important role in increasing its
expectations as to the stability.°° Finally, in response to the Respondent’s argument that the
licensing process did not address the stability of the Incentive Regime, the Claimant states that
the licensing process itself does not necessarily need to refer to the source of the stability to create
an expectation of stability.“

Lastly, the Claimant alleges that the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, in which the

Czech Constitutional Court denied the petitioner’s expectations as to the stability of the Incentive

Regime, is irrelevant to the present case.” As a threshold matter, as indicated in the Case

concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (United States of America v. Italy) judgment and the TECO

 

decision, a domestic court decision does not shield a host State from international liability arising
out of a treaty provision. In addition, the decision is distinguishable from the case at hand,
because the Czech Constitutional Court employed the domestic standard of legitimate
expectations, under which the court focussed on the Solar Levy’s impacts on the investor’s
property right, instead of on a promise provided for by the Czech Republic.“ The Claimant also

notes that the Constitutional Court’s loyalty to the State might have affected its decision.

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should adopt a three-step analysis to establish whether
the Respondent failed to protect the Claimant’s legitimate expectations. In particular, the
Tribunal should analyse (1) whether the Claimant had legitimate expectations; (2) whether the
Claimant reasonably relied on those legitimate expectations; and (3) whether the violation
amounts to a breach of the investment treaties.**° In relation to the last element, the Respondent
states that minor expectations do not trigger a treaty violation.’ Additionally, according to the
Respondent, the Tribunal should analyse the relevant circumstances objectively, and it should
ensure that any expectations were formed at the time of investment. In respect of the threshold

question whether legitimate expectations objectively existed, the Respondent refers to a four-step

test: First, the host State must have given a clear and unequivocal assurance.“ Second, the

641

State’s assurance must apply to individual investors.” Third, the investor must have relied on

the State’s assurance.™ Fourth, the investor’s reliance must have been reasonable.“

In its analysis of the reasonableness of the investor’s reliance, the Respondent argues that the
Tribunal should also take account of social and economic circumstances.“ In this regard, the
Respondent submits that an investor’s expectations as to a stable investment regime are not
“reasonable”, unless the host State gives a specific assurance of stabilization. This is especially
true in the energy sector, where regulatory changes are frequent.“ Further, the Respondent
alleges that legitimate expectations can only derive from specific legislative provisions.“ Since
the Claimant does not refer to any specific provisions of the Act on Income Tax on which it
allegedly relied in making its investment decision, no legitimate expectations could arise in the

first place.“

In response to the Claimant’s allegation that the legitimate expectations may be derived from the
purpose of the Incentive Regime, the Respondent argues that a legislative purpose is not
sufficient, viewed in isolation, to create legitimate expectations, even if the purpose itself is
clear.“* In addition, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not discuss the purposes of
specific provisions, but only refers to an alleged overall purpose.“ Moreover, the Respondent

to attract photovoltaic investors by providing stable incentives in order to achieve the 8%
Indicative 2010 Target.*” The Respondent emphasizes that the 8% target was non-binding on the
EU Member States.' Moreover, no evidence shows that the WACC was set to achieve the 8%
target or that the Czech Republic employed the solar boom to achieve the 8% target.°? The
extension of the estimated lifetime of photovoltaic plants from 15 years to 20 years was

introduced to lower the FiT.°*

According to the Respondent, while the Act on Promotion was
designed to promote all forms of RES investments, a substantial contribution from photovoltaic
energy was not expected. The Respondent further submits that, because more than half of the
solar capacity was installed in the last three months of 201 1, solar energy did not in fact contribute
significantly in achieving the 8% target, which measures RES consumption during the full
calendar year.** The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s assertion that the CEZ’s active
investments in 2009 and 2010 demonstrate the caretaker government’s positive view as to the
solar boom, stating that the CEZ’s management is independent from the Czech Government and

that the CEZ in fact repeatedly expressed negative comments on the solar boom.°*°

In relation to the Claimant’s argument that a 7% post-tax return rate as WACC, would have been

insufficient to attract investors to the Czech photovoltaic market, the Respondent submits that

the WACC is idered as the “mini amount necessary to induce i an

at 7%.°° Moreover, the Respondent points out that Mr. Senogles, the Claimant’s expert,
calculated WACC for the Claimant as below 7%. The Respondent further submits that a 7%

post-tax rate is within the range of WACCs set in other States."*' The Respondent also submits

that the adequacy of the 7% WACC for attracting investments is supported by a steady increase

during the period from 2003 to 2005.°°

With respect to the Claimant’s argument that the legislation of the Incentive Regime and the
relevant political discussions during the enactment process of the Act on Promotion created the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations, the Respondent contends that the Explanatory Report does
not support the Claimant’s argument. First, the report is not a source of law and was submitted
two years before the Act of Promotion’s text was even finalized.*™ Second, the report is irrelevant
to the incentives under the Act on Income Tax and does not even refer to the Shortened
Depreciation Period.°* Moreover, the Respondent argues that, although the Explanatory Report
briefly mentions the Income Tax Exemption, the drafters did not intend to maintain it in light of
the rapid increase in solar installations, which was not expected at the time of drafting.“ In this
regard, the Respondent states that even if Article 19(1)(d) of the Act on Income Tax contained
the 5-year Income Tax Exemption, the Tax Exemption would still be subject to any changes for
these 5 years.” Similarly, the Respondent posits that even if the Act on Income Tax established
the Shortened Depreciation Period, it should not be considered as an assurance to freeze the
depreciation period. Third, the Respondent contends that the Explanatory Report only contains
general explanations and no specific assurances which would be necessary to create a promise of
stability in the energy sector.“ Fourth, the Respondent observes that the Claimant offers no

evidence that it actually relied on the Explanatory Report.”

The Respondent further relies on the decision by the tribunal in Charanne,
with a similar explanatory report published in that case by the Spanish National Energy
Commission. In that case, the tribunal found that while the explanatory report contained specific

not constitute sufficient evidence to support the claimants’ argument that stabilization was
intended.” The Respondent also finds support for its position in the May 2012 Constitutional
Court Judgment, in which the court concluded that the introduction of the Solar Levy and
withdrawal of the Tax incentives did not constitute a violation of investors’ legitimate

expectations.“

With respect to the licensing process, the Respondent points out that the ERO issued a number
of warnings regarding potential legislative changes before 18 October 2010, when Hutira SPV
received the license.°™ Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the licensing process could not
create a promise of stability for the Tax Incentives, because the issued license did not specifically

refer to the Income Tax Provisions.‘”*

With regard to the Income Tax Provisions, the Respondent makes a number of points.°” First,
the Respondent contends that the Claimant has submitted no basis for its expectations as to the
Income Tax Provisions.‘” Indeed, according to the Respondent, the alleged governmental
campaigns did not make any reference to the Income Tax Provisions.°” Second, the Respondent
submits that the Czech Ministry of Finance had already started to contemplate the abolition of
the Tax Exemption as early as November 2009. The Ministry of the Environment expressly
discussed the enactment of the Solar Levy in July 2010, with the Ministry of Finance becoming
involved in September 2010.°” As to the Shortened Depreciation Period, the Respondent alleges
that it is unreasonable to expect that it would be stable only in relation to solar power plants, since
it did not constitute photovoltaic specific legislation.” In addition, the Respondent submits that
the Czech Technical University, in its study for ERO of 2007, already expected that the Income

Tax Provisions would be modified.*!

be put in train after the elected government took office — which was done. In its public statements,
ERO only described the present investment regime and gave no guarantees that it would be

maintained in view of the solar panel investment influx.
(b) Whether the Claimant Relied on the Respondent’s Promise

(1) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that it relied on the Respondent’s promise that the Incentive Regime would
be available for the lifetime of its plants at the time of its investment decision.“ In particular,
the Claimant argues that its business model was based on the assumption that the stable inflation-

ioned by the end of 2010.

 

adjusted Tariffs would be available for 20 years for plants commi:
Lastly, and so as to explain the background of its investment decision, the Claimant adds that the
Incentive Regime and the drop in solar panel prices jointly made the Czech market particularly

attractive for investors.“

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant does not provide any evidence of its reliance on the
Explanatory Report or any other alleged assurance by the Respondent and therefore denies that

any legitimate expectations could have been violated.**

(c) Whether the Claimant’s Reliance on the Respondent’s Promise was
Reasonable

(1) The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant submits that its reliance on the Respondent’s promise was reasonable considering
that the Claimant was entitled to expect that a host State would exercise its general right to change
its investment legislation in a reasonable manner. “° In particular, it is reasonable for investors

to expect that the promised scheme would not be changed in an irrational manner.**”

In the present case, the Claimant alleges that it reasonably relied on the Respondent’s promise,
because of the following three factors: first, the inherent nature of the Incentive Regime was such

as to encourage reliance on it; second, the Respondent continuously provided assurance that any

changes in the Incentive Regime would apply only to new investors; and, third, investors and
banks widely believed that the legal framework would remain stable."* Relying on a judgment
of the English Court of Appeal, which decided that retroactive measures were unlawful,” the
Claimant further asserts that its reliance was reasonable, even though there was no explicit

commitment to stabilize the Incentive Regime.’”

Elaborating on the above reasons, the Claimant submits that the Incentive Regime is designed to
attract RES investments, which requires long-term guarantees and a promise of stability.°! The
Claimant emphasizes that the Act on Promotion did not set any cap on RES electricity entitled to

should expect possible tax scheme changes, the Claimant’s reliance on the Tax Incentives was
reasonable, because, unlike ordinary corporate income taxes, the Tax Incentives featured a

promise of stability for a certain duration.©*

In support of its argument, the Claimant points to Professor JUDr. Ale’ Gerloch’s comment that
the Act on Income Tax promised that the incentives would be available for a certain period of
time and that, therefore, the Czech Government was not allowed to repeal the incentives in
relation to investors that already made use of them.°* The Claimant also argues that the same

rationale applies to the Tariffs contained in the Act on Promotion.“*

Second, according to the Claimant, investors received a number of reassurances that the changes
in the Incentive Regime would not affect investments made by the end of 2010.° For instance,
when discussing the change of the 5% rule, the Czech Government and the ERO expressed their
concern about negative effects on existing investors.’ The Claimant further alleges that its belief

was strengthened by the moratorium period on new applications for grid connections as of

330/2010 and the Explanatory Report®” published in mid-September 2010.”° Furthermore, the
Claimant points out that the ERO’s 2010 report explained that “investors expected a change to
the law [...] for new plants”.”°' The Czech Government’s proposal of an amendment of the Act
on Promotion of 13 October 2010 stated that the Government, instead of existing investors, would

provide new finance to the Incentive Regime.”

With regard to the Ministry of Industry and
Trade’s press release of 24 August 2009, by which it informed the public that it was planning to
introduce amendments to the Act on Promotion, the Claimant submits that only four days after
the press release, the Ministry proposed that the abolition of the 5% rule be introduced to plants

commissioned as of 2011 without affecting existing investments.”

In this regard, the Claimant emphasizes that its investment was made well before the introduction
of the amendment measures, and that accordingly it was not able to anticipate these measures."
The Claimant further notes that its investment became “sunk” upon acquiring the SPV and
entering an Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract.” Accordingly, in the
Claimant’s view, the reasonableness of the Claimant’s reliance should be examined at this point,

after which it was not able to cancel its project.”

The Claimant objects to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant did not exercise sufficient
advance due diligence, stating that it consulted a local expert and an independent energy auditor.

In addition, it relied on the Czech Government’s promotional activities.””

In this regard, the Claimant emphasizes that, in the solar sector, investors are usually small

businesses and that accordingly it is unreasonable to expect them to conduct extensive legal due

diligence.”

Third, the Claimant argues that the widespread belief among investors and banks in the stability

of the Incentive Scheme shows that the Claimant’s reliance was reasonable,””

submitting that
the Tribunal in CMS v. Argentina recognized the relevance of widespread expectations, as it was
unlikely that several professionals make the same mistake at the same time.”"° In particular, not
only investors, but also Czech banks believed that the Tariffs level would be stable.”!! The
Claimant further points out that the Respondent itself believed in such stability, since it gave
licenses to energy experts, which conducted “energy audits” for banks in advance of their

approval of investments.”

Moreover, the Claimant notes that the Czech banks and auditors also
understood that the Tariffs level would apply to plants commissioned by the end of 2010 without
considering the 15-year simple payback and the 7% rate of return.” In this regard, the Claimant
submits that the CEZ, a State-owned entity, also significantly invested in the photovoltaic market

in 2009 and 2010.7!*

With regard to the Czech Constitutional Court’s decision, which held that the Solar Levy was
permissible, the Claimant states that no investor could reasonably have anticipated that decision
at that time.’'° As evidence for this, the Claimant submits that the ERO officials repeatedly

assured the FiT level would remain stable for the plants’ lifetime.”

Lastly, the Claimant alleges that the fact that a caretaker government was in place between May
2009 and July 2010 is irrelevant.”!” In the Claimant’s view, the caretaker government’s lack of
power to change governmental policies did not amount to a “political crisis or political
instability” under which investors could not reasonably expect that a legal framework would be

stable.”'* The Claimant submits that unelected caretaker governments existed frequently in

European and other countries.”° Contrary to the Respondent’s assertion, the Claimant alleges
that it was a political decision by the caretaker government to keep the support for the solar
industry in 2010 at the 2009 level.”° The caretaker government's positive view of the solar boom
is demonstrated in the Czech police report of 3 October 2013, which suspended criminal
proceedings against the ERO Direction. Those proceedings had been instituted based upon a
suspected abuse of power arising out of the ERO’s extension of the life period of photovoltaic
facilities from 15 to 20 years, and its failure to alter the parameters for 2009.”"! The fact that the
CEZ, a State-owned entity, significantly invested in the photovoltaic market in 2009 and 2010

also supports the assumption that a revocation of the incentive regime was not expected.”

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant’s reliance on any alleged promises was unreasonable

for a number of reasons.”

First, in its analysis of the reasonableness of the investor’s reliance, so argues the Respondent,
the Tribunal should also take account of social and economic circumstances. The Respondent
alleges that the Claimant entered into the market, notwithstanding that it knew, or should have
known, that the RES Scheme was financially not sustainable for the year 2010.” In fact, since
July 2009, the ERO and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, in their consultations, presentations
and press releases, had warned of possible changes to the Act on Promotion. They considered the
7% WACC was an original target under the Act on Promotion.’ Moreover, the Respondent
submits that on 24 August 2009, before the Claimant made its investment, the Ministry of

Industry and Trade issued a press release that it was planning to amend the Act on Promotion.””°

In addition, several other sources at the time of the solar ‘bubble’ indicated that a regime change
might be in the offing.”” As evidence of this, the Czech Technical University, in its study for

ERO of 2007, already expected that the Income Tax Provisions would be modified.”*

Reliance on the assumption that the regime would not change in the face of the dramatic influx
of investments, was unreasonable — especially for investors who entered into the market in late
2010, as the Claimant did. The Respondent points out that Mr. Kouty admits that he knew of the
governmental discussions on retroactive changes to the FiT level and that the 7% WACC was
used in setting the original FiT.”° The Respondent argues that if tariffs are too beneficial, as in

the present case, reasonable investors should expect so called-retroactive changes.”

The Respondent submits that the tribunals in AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza
Erémii Kft v. The Republic of Hungary™' and Electrabel v. Hungary” concluded that Hungary’s
re-introduction of administrative pricing for electricity generators was permissible.”? In the
Respondent’s view, these cases provide useful context in the present case, because the challenged
State measure was also meant to reduce excessive profits to the originally intended level.” In
response to the Claimant’s argument that these cases are distinguishable from the case at hand,
because the termination of the administrative pricing was predictable, the Respondent alleges
that the issue in those cases was not the termination, but the re-imposition of the administrative

pricing.”**

Third, in response to the Claimant’s argument that the Respondent’s regulation in the RES sector
had a contractual aspect to it, with the Respondent offering a promise of stability in exchange for
foreign investment, so as to achieve the 8% Indicative EU Target for the year 2010, the
Respondent denies that any “guid pro quo” existed between the Parties.”** The Respondent adds

that the reimbursement of investment costs is not at issue in the present case.””

Fourth, the Respondent objects to the Claimant’s argument that the CEZ’s active investments in
the photovoltaic market in 2009 and 2010 support the reasonableness of the Claimant’s
reliance.”” The Respondent submits that the CEZ repeatedly expressed its negative view as to
the solar boom and that it purchased existing projects instead of building a new plant.”"'

Finally, the Respondent states that the Tribunal should not base its decisions on the Claimant’s

subjective comments.”

expectations.” The Claimant explains that the Act on Promotion guaranteed “revenue” at the
stable Tariffs level, which is affected when the Solar Levy deducts a certain percentage from the
revenue deriving from the Tariffs. “* In this regard, the Claimant points out that the Respondent
itself defined the Solar Levy as “a tax imposed on revenue’ of solar installations”.”° Moreover,
the Claimant observes that, although its expert, Mr. Senogles, used the same revenue figure in

both actual and counterfactual scenarios in his calculation tables, this was just meant to show

 

how the Solar Levy deducts the revenue.””

Second, the Claimant notes that its legitimate expectations were not limited to the 7% return rate

78

or the 15-year simple paybac! Rather, the relevant parameter is whether a stable FiT level for

the 20-year lifetime of the project was guaranteed.”

Third, the Claimant argues that the reasoning of the arbitral awards relied upon by the Respondent
is not applicable in the present case. With respect to Toto Costruzioni,’®° which held that the FET
standard does not entail a guarantee of stability of a tax law regime, the Claimant alleges that the
case dealt with the specific circumstance in Lebanon.”*! With respect to AES and Electrabel,
which found that Hungary’s change in its investment scheme was lawful under the ECT, the
Claimant argues that investors in those cases were able to forecast Hungary’s repeal of the
administrative price regime.” In addition, the relevant legislation contained the language “profit
necessary for ongoing operation”, which is more restrictive than the language “revenue” used in
the Act on Promotion.’ Further, the increase in the return rate that investors in the Electrabel v.
Hungary case received (from 10.7% in 1997 to 39% in 2005) significantly differs from the

increase in the case at hand.’

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent alleges that the legitimate expectations as to the stability of the Incentive Regime

the Claimant may have had, were not violated by the Respondent.

With regard to the Solar Levy, the Respondent first alleges that it did not change the level of the
Tariffs because the levy did not reduce either the FiT price set in the ERO price regulations or
the total revenue from the FiT; it only affected after-tax profits. *° Accordingly, in the
Respondent’s view, the Solar Levy is consistent with Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion,
which allegedly provides, together with the relevant ERO regulations, that the FiT will remain
stable for 20 years.” In addition, the Respondent states that even if there was a violation of
Article 6(1)(b)(2), this would only amount to a breach of local law, which does not rise to the

level of a violation of FET, FPS, or Non-Impairment standards.”*”

Referring to Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. The Republic of Lebanon,”

the Respondent
submits that a host State violates the FET obligation only if it makes a “drastic or discriminatory
change in the essential features of the transaction.” In the present case, however, there was no
such radical change.” In fact, the amendment measures only decreased overall returns for plants
commissioned in 2009 and 2010 by 1.4% (8.4% to 7%) and 3% (11.4% to 8.4%) respectively."
In the Respondent’s view, the Act on Promotion was meant to provide for a 7% lifetime return
and a 15-year payback and the implementation measures did not repeal these. The Act on

Promotion did not contain a promise of good “profitability” of investments.”

In support of this
position, the Respondent also relies on the award in AES” and the decision in Electrabel,’™
which concluded that Hungary’s reduction of profits to the originally purposed level, covering

costs and reasonable return only, was permissible under the ECT.”°

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis
(a) Analysis of the Incentive Regime and of the Facts

Before embarking upon its FET analysis, the Tribunal finds it useful to set out its understanding
of the Incentive Regime that is at the core of the Parties’ dispute, and to summarize the relevant

chronology of the facts.

According to the Claimant, the part of the Incentive Regime relating to taxation dates back to the
introduction of the Act on Income Tax in the year 1992, which provided for the Tax Holiday and
the Shortened Depreciation Period for different types of RES - producers.” In March 2005, the
Respondent adopted the Act on Promotion, with the legislative objective of promoting renewable
energy sources and which, important for present purposes, introduced the FiT and Green
Bonuses. The FiT system obliged grid operators to purchase all electricity produced from RES
on a priority basis at a price annually determined by the ERO — the Czech Energy Regulatory
Office — pursuant to Article 6 of the Act on Promotion, which has been set out earlier in this
Award.””’ The Green Bonus system compensated producers for the difference between the FiT

and the market price.

It is important to note that the Act on Promotion does not contain all details of the Incentive
Regime. Article 6(1) provides that the ERO will define the FiT for solar electricity one calendar
year in advance. Article 6(1)(a) specifies that the FiT must be set so as to allow the Respondent
to meet the 8% Indicative 2010 Target and Article 6(1)(b)(1) provides that the FiT must be such

that the investment in certain PV plants can be paid back within 15 years.

By the Technical Regulation dated 30 November 2005 and amended in 2007 and 2009, the ERO

set out the general technical and economic parameters in order for newly installed plants to
168

achieve the 15-year payback period provided by Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion.

Again as set out earlier in this Award, section 4 of the Technical Regulation stated that:

In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured through the support by
Purchase Prices [FiT] of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and
economic parameters of an installation producing electricity from renewable sources
must be satisfied, where the producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve,
with the given level of Purchasing Prices

b) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the installation,
such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),

and

c) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the
installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero.”
(emphasis added)

The Technical Regulation thus confirmed that the FiT was fixed to obtain a 15-year payback
regime with an adequate return on the investment during its lifetime as determined by the WACC.
The after-tax WACC in turn was set by the ERO at 7%. In other words, the Act on Promotion
guaranteed a FiT that led to a 15-year payback of the investment costs with WACC (or a profit)
of 7% per year over 15 years. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that these were the Act

on Promotion’s primary targets.

This conclusion is not altered by the fact that Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion stipulated
that the “amount of the revenues stays unchanged for the unit of the electricity from renewable
sources with the support of the buy-out prices for the period of 15 years since the year, when the
device was put into operation as minimum amount”. The Tribunal is of the opinion that one
cannot read the first part of that provision in isolation from the remainder of the clause. Notably,
Article 6(1)(b)(2) makes reference to the FiT, or “buy-out prices”, previously mentioned in
Article 6(1)(b)(1) and provides that the FiT is to “support” the “amount of the revenues”
generated by renewable sources. Article 6(1)(b) refers to the FiT and buy-out prices. It does not
provide an abstract guarantee of revenues, but makes those revenues dependent on the buy-out
prices. Moreover, it indicates that the buy-out prices had to be established following the criteria
contained in the Technical Regulation. The promised revenue is therefore necessarily linked to
the FiT. The FiT in turn was set by the ERO, pursuant to the Technical Regulation and, as
explained above, it guaranteed a 15-year payback with a 7% WACC. No other independent

revenue was promised to investors.

The Tribunal notes that the same conclusion was reached by the Czech Constitutional Court in
its May 2012 decision.”

In addition, the Tribunal considers that the modalities of the Incentive Regime were not set in
stone. On the contrary, the implementation of the Act on Promotion through the Technical
Regulations was amended in the course of time. This was confirmed by the Explanatory Note to

the 2007 ERO regulation which stated that the economic and technical parameters would have to

change over the course of time and would not remain fixed:

 

Given the constant p and imp s of the using

resources on the one hand and the changes in input prices on the other, these technical

and economic parameters need to be changed over the course of time.””!
While the 2005 Technical Regulation estimated the useful life of a PV installation at 15 years,
the 2007 Technical Regulation extended the latter period to 20 years’” and the ERO declared
that a post-tax 7% WACC for 20 years would be a reasonable compensation.” Through the
extension of the life span from 15 to 20 years and the maintenance of the 15-year payback
criterion, the 2007 Technical Regulation in fact confirmed the increased profitability of the

photovoltaic investments.”

Afterwards, the 2009 ERO Regulation introduced a 2% annual increase of the FiT, although the
Act on Promotion, Article 6(b)(2), only states that the FiT would be affected by the Index for

Industrial Products.

Between 2008 and 2010, when the Claimant entered into the PV plant business, the effect of the
5% limitation rule and the 2% annual increases, was to limit the decrease in the FiT and Green
Bonuses to about 9%.’ However, the price of PV panels had decreased by more than 40% in
the same time period. This meant that by 2010, the level of compensation attributable to the FiT
and Green Bonuses was some 30% more than had originally been intended and was considered
efficient and fair. These conditions naturally attracted many investors, who wanted to invest in
PV RES. Because the investments became extremely attractive, the number of PV plants and
their capacity increased between | January 2008 and 1 October 2009 from 249 / 3.4 MW to 2,900
/ 116.72 MW.” In June 2009, the payback was said to be 6 years instead of 20 years”, and in
July 2010 still 8 years instead of 20 years.”*

sector circles in the Czech Republic were aware that the then current Incentive Regime was

problematic and, because of the solar boom, would become even more problematic with time.

Political action was difficult, because in March 2009, the Czech Government had resigned. On

19 June 2009, a newspaper reported that the authorities wanted to end the solar boom, but noted

that the changes would not be introduced in 2009, because of the political situation in the Czech

Republic.”” Indeed, the caretaker government had declared that it would leave all controversial

matters for the newly elected government, once it took office. Elections were expected before the

end of 2009, but had to be postponed until 28-29 May 2010. A new government only assumed
office on 13 July 2010.

In the meantime, in early July 2009, the ERO suggested an amendment to the Act on Promotion
to cope with the solar boom and indicated that in some parts of the country, connections of PV
plants to the grid were effectively refused.” On 24 August 2009, the Ministry of Industry issued
a press release to draw attention to the fact that the current subsidy system had become untenable

and announced that it would abolish the 5% limitation rule as of 1 January 2010.”*!

In November 2009, the ERO predicted substantial problems with other RES producers, which
were disadvantaged, and with consumers, who had to bear ancillary costs. In February 2010, a
moratorium was put in place, which precluded future connections to the grid. However, the
entities which had already obtained an authorisation could still sell them to investors. In this
manner, on 19 July 2010, the Claimant acquired 51% of the shares of Hutira, which had already

entered into a Grid Connection Agreement in May 2010.”

In March 2010, the PV sector had sent an open letter to the Czech Parliament about the
problem. ** On 22 July 2010, a newsletter highlighted the problem, indicating that the

Government was intent upon “cut[ting] the absurdly lucrative revenues of the solar barons” and

that the Minister of Finance was considering the withdrawal of the Tax Holiday.”

As stated above, three days before the publication of the newsletter, on 19 July 2010, Claimant
had acquired 51% of the shares of Hutira for the relatively small amount of CZK 1,020,000 (some
EUR 41,000). However, by that date, the Claimant had also lent CZK 4,500,000 (some
EUR 182,000) to Hutira.”* The decisive step in the investment in the eyes of the Tribunal was,
however, the conclusion by Hutira of the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract
on 2 August 2010, whereby Hutira committed itself to pay the construction company
CZK 14,779,800 and EUR 2,639,250 (i.e., in total EUR 3,839,000) for the installation of the
power plant.’*° The works started on 2 August and had to be terminated on 24 September 2010,

the moment by which nearly the full amount should have been paid.”*”

The construction was for the greatest part financed through a senior bank loan of CZK 54,131,000
(some EUR 2,190,000), dated 29 October 2010, from Komercni Banka. ** However, the
Claimant also loaned Hutira funds, which were largely used to finance the construction:
CZK 4,500,000 (some EUR 182,000) before 2 August 20107’; CZK 31,000,000 (some
EUR 1,258,000) after 2 August 2010. Unquestionably, the lion’s share was thus loaned by the
Claimant to Hutira after 2 August 2010. Moreover, while the Claimant had purchased 51% of
Hutira’s shares on 19 July for CZK 1,020,000, it purchased the remaining 49% of the shares after
2 August 2010 for the more substantial amount of CZK 8,800,000. Consequently, although the
Claimant had spent some funds on the project before 2 August 2010, 87% of its funds were spent
after 2 August 2010, the date that the construction started and the point of no return was reached.

The Tribunal therefore considers 2 August 2010 as the relevant date for the investment.

The Tribunal observes that the Claimant itself admits that, as a small business, it could not carry
out extensive due diligence. It refers to statements, made prior to 19 July and 2 August 2010, by
ERO and other official bodies, which indicated that the support regime, as it was then applicable,
included a stable FiT and Green Bonuses for 20 years. But that does not constitute proof that
these statements were specifically addressed to the Claimant, nor that the Claimant relied on
them. It remains unknown to what extent the Claimant saw the inevitability of an amendment of
the support regime because of the substantial decrease in the costs of solar panels and the flood
of new investors in solar energy production. The Claimant might well have recognised that the
Czech authorities would like to end the solar boom, but that the changes would not be introduced
in 2009 because of the political situation.” Or it could have been aware that in July 2009, the
ERO proposed the amendment of the Act on Promotion and indicated that in some parts of the
country connections of PV plants to the grid were effectively refused.” Or it could have known
that in November 2009, the ERO discussed the objections against the solar support system from
non-solar RES producers and the ancillary costs consumers had to bear for the solar support
system. Or it could (or should) have rung a bell that in February 2010 a national moratorium was
put in place, which had the effect of freezing any new authorisations for future connections to the
grid. In fact, it is telling that Hutira had audited the profitability of the project well after the

installation contract was concluded on 2 August 2010.”

On | January 2011, the following amendments came into force: (1) the abolition of the 5%
limitation for FiT reductions for new plants as of 2011; (2) the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives;
and (3) the introduction of the Solar Levy. The Tribunal notes that all of these changes were

already long foreshadowed by the time that Hutira embarked on the erection of the solar panel

plant on 2 August 2010.

The possibility that the 5% rule would be abolished had been mentioned already in June 2009”

and in August 2009, this change was announced.” On 8 September 2009, the ERO insisted that
the 5% rule be abolished.”*

As for the Tax Incentives, the Tribunal observes that they are not covered by the ECT because of
Article 21 ECT. Besides, it considers that they had no structural link to the incentives stemming
from the Act on Promotion, which makes no mention of tax exemptions. Only the Explanatory
Report drafted two years prior to the Act on Promotion, mentioned tax benefits as part of the
Incentive Regime. The Tribunal is of the view that the relevance of the Explanatory Report is
negligible, since it does not have the status of legislation and only depicts the general context.

Moreover, when the Government to PV ii , the tax incenti

were not mentioned. On the contrary, a 2007 study of the Czech Technical University for ERP
expected that the tax regime would be modified. Although it is not established that the Claimant
was aware of this study, it is plain that the study reflects the thinking in 2007 about tax incentives
and is therefore pertinent in this context. In November 2009, the abolition of the tax incentives
was contemplated by the Ministry of Finance. On 23 July 2010, the Minister of Environment
stated that he intended to cut the Tax Holiday.””* Thereafter, Act 346/2010 amending the Income

Tax Act was introduced, and on 12 November 2010, approved.

While the Tribunal is aware that the introduction of the Solar Levy occurred after the Claimant
made its investments, it observes that the Claimant was already informed by ERO Regulation
2007 that the economic and technical parameters would have to change over the course of time

and would not remain fixed.”

Overall, the Tribunal concludes that it was already clear towards the end of 2009 that the 5%
limitation would be abolished. Amendments in the tax regime were foreshadowed as early as
2007. In November 2009, they were under consideration by the Minister of Finance and a
decision to implement them was made in July 2010. As of June 2010, there was concrete
speculation about the introduction of a Solar Levy. On the basis of this understanding, the

Tribunal now turns to the different heads of claim put forward by the Claimant.

(b) Discussion of the Claims

As already set out earlier in this Award, the Parties are divided as to whether the Respondent, by
implementing the Solar Levy and withdrawing the Tax Incentives, has violated the Claimant’s

right to FET under Article 10(1) of the ECT:
Article 10(1) of the ECT provides, in relevant part:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage
and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting
Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security [...].

In essence, again as noted earlier, the Claimant asserts three heads of claim under the FET

standard: (1) the Respondent’s violation of its obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal

framework; and (2) the Respondent’s violation of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations. The

Tribunal will consider the arguments pertaining to each of the two in turn. In a last step, the

Tribunal will examine (3) whether the Respondent’s actions were taken in a non-transparent

manner in violation of the FET standard.

(1) | Stable and Predictable Legal Framework
As for the alleged violation of the Respondent’s obligation to provide a stable and predictable
legal framework as part of the FET standard, as set out in more detail earlier, the Claimant
submits that the Respondent failed to provide such a framework by introducing the Solar Levy.
In the Claimant’s view, the Incentive Regime established by the Act on Promotion, ERO
regulations and the Act on Income Tax between them created the Incentive Regime, which the
Respondent was precluded from changing before foreign investors could obtain the promised
benefits. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s characterization of the Incentive Regime as
guaranteeing stability. It maintains that mere changes to the legal framework applicable to the

Claimant’s investment do not give rise to a breach of the ECT or BIT.

As the Tribunal has already noted, the Act on Promotion provided for a 15-year payback and the
maintenance for a period of 15 years of the amount of revenue per unit of RES electricity. The
question, however, is whether the introduction of the Solar Levy and the Tax measures were in

breach of the Respondent’s obligation to provide a stable and predictable framework.

Having carefully considered all materials before it, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that

it did not expressly undertake any agreed stabilization commitment, be it contractual, legislative,

individual or otherwise, vis-a-vis the Claimant’s investment.””* Had the Tribunal found that such

stabilization commitment existed in the present circumstances, there would obviously have been

a solid basis to allege that changes in the law applicable to the foreign investment in question

were unlawful. In the absence of such express commitment, however, the Tribunal must now turn

to the question whether an obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for

foreign investment is, in any event, a separate and distinguishable part of the treaty obligation to
accord FET.

In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that such a separate obligation exists as part
of the FET standard. While there is a certain overlap between the two, this obligation is legally
distinct from the protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations. This is apparent from the
wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT, according to which “[e]ach Contracting Party [...] shall
create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors”. Investment
tribunals have consistently decided, and this Tribunal agrees, that the obligation to guarantee a
stable and predictable investment framework forms part of the FET standard. Compelling reasons

to deviate from this established jurisprudence have not been put forward by the Respondent.

The obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework is to be considered
objectively. It is a general obligation of host countries under investment treaties and does not
require the demonstration of any reliance on the host State’s conduct on the part of the foreign
investor. This said, the Tribunal finds itself in agreement with the line of cases that have held that
the requirement of stability is not absolute and must not be interpreted overly broadly.”” In
particular, it does not in all circumstances affect the state’s inherent right to exercise its sovereign
power to respond to changing circumstances, for example with revisions in its legislation or legal
system. As aptly put by the Tribunal in Total, in words with which the Tribunal is in full
agreement, “changes to general legislation, in the absence of specific stabilization promises to
the foreign investor, reflect a legitimate exercise of the host state’s governmental powers that are

not prevented by a BIT’s fair and equitable treatment standard”.*”

The next issue is whether the Respondent violated its obligation in the circumstances of the

present case.

The Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant’s argument that the fact that the Incentive Regime was

intended to attract foreign investment, in and of itself, meant that it also offered a commitment

Page 158 of 195

of stability and predictability to foreign investors. To support its argument, the Claimant points
not only to the Act on Promotion, but also to the Explanatory Report and the implementing
regulations. While the Tribunal acknowledges that the Explanatory Report in particular used
terms such as “stable” and “maintain”, the Tribunal considers that such language, in the absence
of an express stabilization commitment, is insufficient to ground the obligation for which the
Claimant contends. In particular, the use of such words in the context in which they appear did
not, in the Tribunal’s considered view, signal an undertaking by the Respondent, much less a
specific undertaking to this Claimant, that there would be no changes whatsoever to the legal
framework created by the Act on Promotion — in particular in the event of radically changed
circumstances (such as the solar boom in 2009-2010, which fundamentally changed the financial
soundness of the support regime). On any view, this would have been a far-reaching undertaking,
with potentially extreme consequences for the Respondent and its citizens. No such agreement

can be inferred from the few words or other matters relied upon by the Claimant.

Moreover, the Tribunal observes that the Solar Levy did not, in fact, repeal the fundamental
features of the Incentive Scheme, as described earlier. The Claimant still received both a stable
FiT and Green bonuses. The Solar Levy had either to be paid quarterly by the energy producer

or it could be withheld by the energy distributor.

Further, and in any event, the Tribunal points out that the Tax Statute did not contain a reference
to stability or to the maintenance of the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation

Period.

The Tribunal finds that the changes introduced by the Respondent to the Incentive Regime were
part of the exercise of the Respondent’s sovereign right to regulate tariffs — in particular in the
context of the solar boom and its substantial adverse consequences as described earlier. They did
not violate the Respondent’s obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for

foreign investment.

The Tribunal is confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that, even after the Solar Levy reduced
excessive profits, PV investors still secured a more than reasonable return. Without the legislative
amendments, the reference plant would have received a full payback in 7.8 years. Following the
amendments, the payback could still be achieved in 9.9 years, and was therefore well below the

801

promised 15 years.’ The return for the reference plant without the amendments would have been

11.4%, while - with the amendments - the return amounted to 8.4%, and hence remained well

above the promised 7% return rate.*”?

In other words, despite the amendment measures, PV
investments were as profitable - and in fact more profitable - than envisaged when the support

system was created.

(2) Legitimate Expectations
As for the second claim, the Claimant argues that the Respondent violated the Claimant’s

legitimate expectations by repealing the Tax Incentives and introducing the Solar Levy.

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers that little, if any, guidance on the question of
legitimate expectations may be gleaned from the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment. The
Court in that case held that the petitioners did not have legitimate expectations as to the stability
of the Incentive Regime. The Tribunal shares the Claimant’s view that domestic court decisions
cannot shield a State from international liability arising out of a treaty violation. Therefore, while
certainly informative, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to engage with, or adopt, the

reasoning of the Czech Constitutional Court.

As regards the relationship between regulatory autonomy of host States and the FET standard,
especially in the context of legitimate expectations, the Tribunal subscribes to the view expressed

by the Tribunal in Micula, which held that:

The fair and equitable treatment standard does not give a right to regulatory stability per
se, The state has a right to regulate, and investors must expect that the legislation will
change, absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurance giving rise to a legitimate
expectation of stability. Thus, the Claimants
analyzed in the context of the protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations.

‘regulatory stability” argument must be
$03

The Tribunal is also entirely in agreement with the following reasoning of the Micula Tribunal:

When the alleged legitimate expectation is one of regulatory stability, the reasonableness
of the expectation must take into account the underlying presumption that, absent an
assurance to the contrary, a state cannot be expected to freeze its laws and regulations.
As noted by the Saluka tribunal, ‘[nJo investor may reasonably expect that the
circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged.
In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor’s expectations was

inputs without amendments, and was 11.4 or 10.8 years respectively with the amendments, ie., also well
below the promised 15 years.

First Peer Report, para. 4.8.3: The return for the Claimant would have been 9.7% with the Claimant’s
inputs or 10.5% on the basis of adjusted inputs without the amendments and was 6.6% or 7.3% respectively
with the amendments, i.¢., also well above the promised 7% return rate. All the measures together reduced
the return for the 2009 reference plant from 8.4% to 7%; Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 230:8-18.

justified and reasonable, the host state’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate
domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.’
Accordingly, for a state to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard by changing
the regulatory framework, the investor must have received a legitimate assurance that the
relevant laws and regulations would not be changed in his or her respect.*™*

Additionally, the Tribunal finds guidance in the approach of the Tribunal in Duke Energy v.
Ecuador, which stated that:

The stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor’s
justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such expectations are an
important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is mindful of their
limitations. To be protected, the investor’s expectations must be legitimate and
reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The assessment of the
reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only
the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and
historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise
from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon
them when deciding to invest.5°

The Parties essentially agree on the applicable test in this case to establish whether there has been
a violation of an investor’s legitimate expectations, namely: (a) whether the Respondent gave an
assurance as to regulatory stability; (b) whether the Claimant effectively relied on such assurance;
(c) whether this reliance was reasonable, taking into account the prevailing social and economic
circumstances* in the energy sector and at the time; (d) whether the Respondent violated the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations, bearing in mind that de minimis violations do not meet the
necessary threshold for treaty violations.*”’ This test is consistent with the elements considered

by other international tribunals.*°*

Each of these elements is considered in turn below, in light of all the matters set out earlier in
this Award.

a) TheR did not give any as to regulatory stability.

 

First, having carefully considered all materials and submissions before it, the Tribunal accepts

that no assurance was ever given by the Respondent that the support system from which the

Claimant benefitted would never change. The relevant tax legislation did not state for how long
the favourable tax regime would be applicable. Equally, the Act on Promotion only provided that
the revenues would depend on buy-out prices, which were established on the basis of criteria to
be determined by ERO. It did not indicate that the FiT would remain unchanged for the duration
of a plant’s operation. Moreover, the ERO 2005 Technical Regulation, which implemented the
determination of the FiT, had already been amended only two years later, in 2007, thus illustrating
that in the energy sector, and certainly the Czech energy sector, regulatory changes were frequent.
Moreover, the Tribunal fails to see how the Claimant could draw an assurance of legislative
stability from a prospective 2003 Explanatory Report to the 2005 Act on Promotion, which stated
that the forthcoming Act purported to achieve “a stable promotion” of investments. Nor does the
Tribunal see how a mere mention in a 2009 ERO Report that the Act on Promotion brought a
guarantee of long-term and stable promotion, could be understood as a confirmation of the Czech
Republic’s obligation not to alter the legislative framework. The Tribunal agrees with the
Respondent that in the absence of a stabilization provision, the Incentive Regime could be altered

whenever there was economic justification to do so.

As stated above with regard to the Respondent’s treaty obligation to maintain a stable and
predictable legal framework, in the absence of an express stabilization commitment, changes to
address the solar boom were within the Respondent’s regulatory power. And this all the more so,
given that, ultimately, the changes in issue did not significantly undermine the actual support as

originally envisaged.

As for the tax incentives in particular, contrary to the Claimant’s position, the Tribunal considers
that, fairly judged, the Respondent never created the impression that these incentives, which had
already existed since 1992, could never be withdrawn. Moreover, these measures were not an
integral part of the Incentive Regime in any event. They were only sporadically mentioned in the
2003 Explanatory Note issued two years before the Act on Promotion was promulgated. And
they were not included in the presentations on, and descriptions of, the incentives for PV

investments.

In all the circumstances, in the absence of any

 

ssurance by the Respondent, the Tribunal
concludes that the Claimant cannot have had a legitimate expectation that the Incentive Regime
on which it relies would always remain in place and unchanged, and that the Respondent would

be precluded from exercising its usual regulatory power in this regard.

b) The Claimant did not rely upon any such assurance

Second, even if an assurance had been given by the Respondent, the Tribunal concludes that it

was not, or would not have been, relied upon by the Claimant at the relevant time.

In the Tribunal’s view, the relevant moment to assess whether the Claimant relied upon any
alleged assurance as to the stability of the Incentive Regime is when the EPC contract was
concluded and the works for the installation started. 87% of the required funds were spent after
2 August 2010. The Claimant appears to agree that this is the relevant moment for the Tribunal’s
assessment.*” Therefore, the relevant time period for the Tribunal’s enquiry is between August

and September 2010.

The Tribunal has seen no evidential basis that either (a) when the Claimant acquired from Enkory
a.s. 51% of the shares of Hutira on 19 July 2010 or (b) when it actually concluded the EPC
contract on 2 August 2010, the Claimant was, in fact, aware of the statements of the Czech

Authorities to which it now refers, or that it actually relied upon them.

In any event, the promotional activities, upon which the Claimant allegedly relied, contained a

warning that the legislation may change.
c) Any such reliance would not have been reasonable

Third, even if the Claimant relied on some alleged “stabilization” assurances from the Czech

Authorities — quod non —, any such reliance would not have been reasonable.

In particular, the Tribunal considers that the 3 November 2008 letter from ERO, which explained
how the Incentive Regime worked, could not form the basis for a legitimate expectation one and

a half years later in a drastically changed situation.

Equally, the Tribunal does not consider that the 2009 ERO Report, which hinted that the Act on
Promotion guaranteed a long-term and stable promotion, was sufficient a basis upon which the
Claimant could form a legitimate expectation, given the legal status of this document (merely a

report from an administrative body) and the vague nature of its wording.

Further still, and as explained at some length above, the Tribunal finds that already at the relevant
times (August/September 2010) there had been an accumulation of apparent warning signs that
ought to have precluded any such expectation on the part of the Claimant, and, objectively
viewed, did preclude the possibility that the Claimant might be said reasonably to have relied on

any such alleged assurances.

It was manifest in 2009-2010 that the FiT could no longer be maintained unchanged. It was clear

that, for this purpose, the 5% limitation rule would be abandoned for future plants. Moreover, it
became evident that the abolition of the 5% limitation for future plants would not, of itself, be
sufficient to address what had become an unreasonable and unsustainable support system for
plants, which entered into operation in 2009 and 2010. The Tribunal therefore finds that the
Claimant was not reasonably entitled to expect that no measures would be taken with regard to
the FiT for plants in operation before 2011. The changes that were promulgated were within the

reasonable discretion of the State.

In all the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant could not have had a reasonable
or legitimate expectation concerning the continuation of the support regime without any
modification, and it could not reasonably have purported to rely on any alleged assurances to that

effect.

d) No violation of legitimate expectations because of EU law

The Tribunal observes additionally that the law of the European Union on State Aid precluded,
in any event, any legitimate expectation that plants which entered into operation in 2009-2010
would necessarily maintain the benefit of the support system as it then existed, as long as this

support system was not duly notified.

Notably the very first line of the Act on Promotion, which is the cornerstone of the solar support
regime, explicitly referred to the EU legislation, which prevails over the provisions of the Act.
Indeed, under the heading “Object of Regulation” the first line of Article 1(1) reads: “This Act
regulates, in accordance with the legislation of the European Communities, the method of
promoting the production of electricity from renewable energy sources...”. The legislation of the
European Communities includes crucial sections on competition law, among which are
provisions on State Aid. The fact that this explicit reference to the legislation of the European
Communities was accompanied by a footnote mentioning Directive 2001/77 on the promotion of
electricity produced by renewable energy sources does not alter the fact that the Act on Promotion

referred to the whole body of Community Law, including its mandatory provisions on State aid.

It is undisputed by the Parties that within each of the Member States, including, of course, the
Czech Republic, EU law forms part of the domestic law. Its mandatory rules, including its
mandatory provisions on State aid, apply therein. Moreover, it is clear that mandatory rules of

EU law have primacy over even mandatory rules of domestic law.

The argument has been made that the profits, which the Claimant would have drawn from the
production of solar electricity (in the absence of the Solar Levy or the Tax Amendments), were
prohibited under Article 107(1) of the TFEU. This provides:

562.

563.

PCA Case No. 2014-22
Award
Page 164 of 195

any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever
which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or
the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States,

be incompatible with the internal market. *'”

The Tribunal, however, does not itself need to dwell on the compatibility of the support system
with the EU internal market, given that the EC, by its Decision of 28 November 2016, concluded
that the subsidies under the RES Scheme for plants commissioned between | January 2006 and
31 December 2012 constituted State aid under Article 107(3) TFEU.*!! In the Tribunal’s view,
that Decision provides the authoritative answer to the detailed debate between the Parties as to

whether the EU provisions on State aid were engaged here.*!”

For the present case, it is also irrelevant that the EC decided in 2016 that — at that time — the

return yielded by the solar support regime, based upon the Act on Promotion, but corrected by a

Counter-Memorial, para. 247.

EC, State aid decision $A.40171 (2015/NN) — “Czech Republic — Promotion of electricity production
from renewable energy sources”, Decision, 28 November 2016, paras. 11, 84, 94, 126 (Ex. R-411).

Relying on PreussenElektra AG v. Schleswag AG, ECJ Judgment, Case C-378/98, 13 March 2001 (Ex.
CLA-1) the Claimant argued that “an economic advantage benefiting certain undertakings does not
constitute State aid within the meaning and scope of Article 107(1) TFEU where the advantage in question
is not financed through State resources but is instead financed by private undertakings pursuant to a
purchase obligation imposed by the State”, The Claimant alleged that this principle had not been overruled
by subsequent cases. With respect to the RES support scheme set out in the original Act on Promotion, the
Claimant explained that the original funding scheme did not involve any transfer of State resources because
the legislation required the grid operators to pay both the FiT and the Green Bonuses from their own private
budget. With respect to the new RES support scheme introduced by Act No. 402/2010 and the 2013 New
Act on Promotion, the Claimant argued as follows: First, the Claimant did not make its investment under
these new schemes, therefore their compliance with EU law is irrelevant to the present case. Second, the
new funding mechanism did not involve State resources. With respect to Act No. 402/2010, which
introduced the Solar Levy, the Claimant alleged that “even if the amendments introduced by Act No.
42/2010 entailed State aid, such aid would in any event not be granted to solar producers” since the
resources from the levy were paid to transmission and grid system operators.

The Respondent, from its side, observed that the law regarding EU State aid rules for RES schemes has
developed since the famous decision in PreussenElektra, which is applicable when “the purchase
obligation in question was financed entirely from the private resources of the grid operators themselves”
(Rejoinder, para. 292; Counter-Memorial, para. 282, referring to Essent Netwerk Noord, ECJ Judgment,
Case C-206/06, 17 July 2008 (Ex. RLA-70); Association Vent De Colére!, ECJ Judgment, Case C-262/12,
19 December 2013 (Ex. RLA-71); Austria v. Commission, Judgment of the Tribunal of the European
Union, Case T-251/11, 18 May 2011 (Ex. RLA-72); Counter-Memorial, paras. 274-284; Rejoinder, paras.
291-293). The Respondent further referred to the EC’s January 2014 Draft Notice on the Notion of State
aid, which comprehensively reflects the EC’s current position on public support schemes (Counter-
Memorial, para. 283, referring to Draft Commission Notice on the notion of State aid pursuant to Article
107(1) TFEU, 17 January 2014, para. 66 (Ex. RLA-73). This Draft Notice provides as follows: surcharges
imposed by law on private persons can be qualified as State resources. It is the case even where a private
company is appointed by law to collect such charges on behalf of the State and to channel them to the
beneficiaries, without allowing the collecting company to use the proceeds from the charges for purposes
other than those provided for by the law. In this case, the sums in question remain under public control and
are therefore available to the national authorities, which is sufficient reason for them to be considered State
resources,

Solar Levy of 26% for the years 2011-2013 and 10% as of 2014, had brought the return back to
a reasonable level, so that the support was no longer illegal State aid under EU law. The enquiry
for present purposes concerns the period before this, in 2009-2010. Nor is it significant that the
Decision did not spell out in express terms that the solar support regime without the Solar Levy

would, on the contrary, constitute illegal aid.*'?

Further still, as will be apparent from the discussion below, the question whether the support
regime, if State aid, would be exempted under Article 108 TFEU (again an issue much debated

by the Parties) is immaterial for the present case.

The basic rule with regard to State aid under EU law is that State aid is only permitted when it
has been approved by the EC. As summarized by Ms. Bacon in her First Expert Report, it is “very
well established that, in principle, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not entertain
any legitimate expectation that is lawful, unless it has been granted in accordance with the

procedure set out in Article. 108 TFEU.”*!4

Consequently, the relevant question is whether, at the time the investment was made, the EC had,
upon due notification, positively decided that the solar support regime was compatible with EU
law. In the absence of due notification and any such decision, the investor — as in the present case
— was not entitled to hold any legitimate expectations that the un-notified support system would
not be changed. The Tribunal is aware that the Czech Republic had stated in the Explanatory
Report of November 2003 that the future Act on Promotion would be “compatible with the public
aid law of the European Union”.*!* The Republic repeated that view in a few instances up to
2009. However, statements from domestic authorities cannot give rise to legitimate expectations
when they are counter to mandatory EU law. In its 2016 Decision, the EC formally confirmed
that the Incentive Regime, as applicable to installations commissioned between 1 January 2006
and 31 December 2012, constituted State aid. Statements from domestic authorities cannot alter
this. Given that it is not for a Member State to declare its own aid schemes compatible with EU

law, any such declaration cannot be a basis for a legitimate expectation.

Neither can legitimate expectations be based upon the letter of 27 July 2004 from the EC (the
“27 July 2004 Letter”), which was written in response to a complaint of 16 December 2003 from
the Czech Society of Wind Energy and EUROSOLAR. In that letter, the EC stated — on the basis
of the 2003 draft of the Act — that incentives under the Act on Promotion did not constitute State

aid because the Investment Regime did not involve State resources.*!®

The Claimant argues that the 27 July 2004 Letter was a sufficient basi:

 

for its legitimate

expectations.*!” An EC decision can create legitimate expectations, even if it does not address

 

specific individuals as long as the decision is widely eminated and known.*'* In the present
case, the decision was widely disseminated and known, because it was sent to the two main
industry associations in the RES sector, ie., the Czech Society of Wind Energy and
EUROSOLAR.*" Referring to Athinaiki Techniki v Commission, the Claimant further submits
that the Court of Justice of the European Union has held that the EC’s letter by which it decided
that there was no breach of EU law and that no further investigations would be conducted,

amounts to a formal decision on which the Claimant can rely.*”°

According to the Claimant:

The right to rely on the principle of legitimate expectations constitutes one of the
fundamental principles of EU State aid law. It extends to any person who is ina situation
in which it is clear that the EU authorities have, by giving precise assurances, led him to
entertain legitimate expectations. Regardless of the form in which it is communicated,
information that is precise, unconditional and consistent and comes from an authorised
and reliable source constitutes such assurance. *!

The Respondent denies that the Claimant could have had legitimate expectations as to the
compatibility of the Respondent’s incentive scheme with EU State aid law.’ According to the
Respondent, such legitimate expectations may only arise if “precise, unconditional and

consistent assurances originating from authorised, reliable sources [were] given to the person

concerned by the competent authorities of the European Union”.*” Contrary to the Claimant’s
argument, the Respondent maintains that the EC’s 27 July 2004 Letter was insufficient to create
legitimate expectations.** The 27 July 2004 Letter only addressed a 2003 draft (on the basis of
information provided by EUROSOLAR) which differed substantially from the 2005 Act on
Promotion. Neither the draft, nor the information provided by EUROSOLAR explained — nor
indeed could have explained — the precise funding mechanism of the RES Scheme and the amount

of the FiT. They were, after all, only put in place in 2005.°°

Moreover, the 27 July 2004 Letter was not intended to bring an end to the investigation. Nor did
it constitute a formal decision.*” To this end, the decision of the Court of Justice in Athinaiki®”’
is to be distinguished, since in that case it was held that a letter issued by the EC, which did, in
fact, close the file on a complaint, constituted a formal decision.*** Furthermore, the EC was
entitled to change its initial assessment, which was based on the reasoning in PreussenElektra,
in light of subsequent developments in European case law after 2004.*” Finally, according to the
Respondent, the Claimant did not directly rely on the 27 July 2004 Letter in any event. In
response to the Claimant’s allegation that it “relied on the [27] July 2004 Letter indirectly,
because that letter was ‘relied on by the Respondent’’ in, for example, the drafting of the
Explanatory Report on the Act on Promotion, the Respondent notes that the Explanatory Report
was drafted nine months before the 27 July 2004 Letter.*"!

With regard to the EC’s subsequent enquires, it is the Respondent’s position that the EC did not
take any formal decision by which it would be bound in respect of the applicability of the State
aid rule on the Incentive Regime.*” Hence, when it confirmed that the exemption of “ecological

tax” did not amount to State aid in a different case, the EC expressly noted that such a decision

did not bind its future position.**°

The Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent’s analysis on this issue. The Tribunal does not
consider that the 27 July 2004 Letter constitutes a basis for legitimate expectations, since it
addressed no more than a legislative draft, and it did so in response to a general complaint from
professional organisations that the envisaged act would favour particular energy producers and
state companies.** For the purposes of its analysis, the EC did not have — and could not have had
— information about the exact funding mechanism of the RES Scheme and the amount of the FiT,

as these modalities were only put in place in 2005."

Moreover, by definition, the decision of the
EC with respect to a draft of possible future legislation could only be preliminary. The provisional
scope of the 27 July 2004 Letter is well illustrated by its last paragraph: “Should you learn of any
new particulars that might demonstrate the existence of an infringement of the State aid rules, I
would be grateful if you would inform my department as soon as possible” In all the
circumstances, it is clear that the EC did not intend to render a final and binding decision on the
future Act on Promotion on the basis of the limited information it had received with regard to the
2003 draft of that law. And as held by the Court of Justice in the Athinaiki judgment, a formal

Decision by the EC would require an intention on its part to state a definitive position.

It follows that, in the Tribunal’s view, the 27 July 2004 Letter was not a Decision. Furthermore,
even if it could be construed as such in 2004 when it was rendered, under the Athinaiki judgment,
this still does not mean that the Decision could have given rise to legitimate expectations in 2009
or 2010. As was pointed out in the Athinaiki judgment, the Decision would only remain
applicable for so long as no new information became available.**”’ Here, new and significant
information did become available after 2004 (namely the final text of the Act on Promotion and

the specific financial incentives thereby established).

Given the Tribunal’s conclusion that the 27 July 2004 Letter and other statements discussed
above could not have led to legitimate expectations, there is no need for the Tribunal to inquire
into the question of reasonable reliance by the Claimant upon the matters in question when it

made its investment.
In summary, when the investments were made, the Incentive Regime, although State aid, had not

been notified to, and approved by, the EC. Under EU law, it therefore follows that as at that time,

there could not have been any legitimate expectations as alleged by the Claimant.

(3) Transparency

In a third step, the Tribunal must next consider whether the Respondent breached its obligation

towards the Claimant to act in a transparent manner.

It is clear that the FET standard entails a transparency component — as confirmed by the text of

Article 10(1) of the ECT, which refers in terms to “transparent conditions for Investors”.

The concept of transparency is closely related to an investor’s legitimate expectations. Dolzer
and Schreuer define transparency as follows: “Transparency means that the legal framework for
the investor’s operations is readily apparent and that any decisions affecting the investor can be
traced back to that legal framework.”*** In addition, the Tribunal considers that transparency must
include a requirement that information about relevant changes in the investment framework are

communicated well in advance.

As noted above, it is the investor’s expectations at the time of the investment that are relevant for
the Tribunal’s assessment. And as noted previously, the Tribunal considers that the relevant date

for the investment is 2 August 2010.

The possibility that a Solar Levy would be introduced by | January 2011 was considered on 23
July 2010*” and was formally announced on 20 October 2010.“ As noted earlier in this Award,
the Tribunal has no doubt that it was already obvious at the time of the investment that the sharp
increase in the number of PV power plants connecting to the grid would lead to a crisis. Because
of the rush of new investments made in the PV sector in the last months of 2010, the introduction
of measures as of 2011 became an inevitability. On the other hand, investors knew that the
caretaker government that was in place in the Czech Republic at that time would not take
substantial policy decisions as it did not have the necessary political support. Parliamentary
elections were substantially delayed. A viable and politically sustainable government was only
established in July 2010.

Considering (1) that there was an obvious and transparent need for the Incentive Regime to be

changed; (2) that there was a political vacuum until July 2010; and (3) the dramatic increase of

PV plant grid connections in the last months of 2010, the Tribunal holds that the Czech Republic

was as transparent as it could have been in the circumstances.

In all the circumstances, as detailed earlier in this Award, the Tribunal therefore does not consider

that the Respondent violated its obligation under the FET standard to act in a transparent manner.

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE OBLIGATION TO GRANT FULL PROTECTION
AND SECURITY

1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached its obligation to grant full protection and
security (“FPS”) by introducing the Solar Levy and repealing the Tax Exemption and the
Shortened Depreciation Period.*! The obligation to provide FPS is contained in Article 10(1) of
the ECT.6°

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage
and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting
Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security [...].4°
The Claimant submits that while, historically, the FPS standard was restricted to mere physical
protection, its scope has been extended over time to encompass legal protection.“ In particular,
referring to CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic,’ Azurix Corp. v. Argentine
Republic,“ National Grid P.L.C. v. Argentina Republic,” and Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v.

sas.

United Republic of Tanzania,” the Claimant submits that the FPS standard requires host States

to provide a secure and stable investment environment to protect investors.*”

Since the FPS and the FET standards substantially overlap in this regard, the Claimant submits

that the FPS standard is violated for the same reasons as set out in greater detail above.**°

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the introduction of the Solar Levy and the repeal of the Tax
Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period did not constitute a violation of the FPS

standard for the same reasons that they did not constitute a violation of the FET standard.**!

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Given the way this particular allegation has been framed, it can be addressed briefly.

The Parties agree that a guarantee of “constant” or “full” protection and security is afforded to
foreign investments under Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Parties also agree that the legal test as
to whether a violation of this standard has occurred in the present case largely overlaps with the
test applicable to violations of the FET standard. This is because the Claimant puts its case in
terms of the “legal”, and not the “physical”, dimension of the FPS standard as interpreted by
international tribunals, which it has articulated in terms of the host country’s obligation to

guarantee a secure and stable investment environment to protect foreign investments.

Given the overlap in standards, the Tribunal refers simply to its earlier analysis. For the reasons
that have been fully explored above in the context of the FET standard, the Tribunal finds that no

violation of the FPS standard has occurred in this case.

unreasonable and inconsistent manner.***
Article 10(1) of the ECT provides:

[...] no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures thfe] use, enj or disposal [of of
Investors of other Contracting Parties] [...]

In response to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s investment was not significantly

853,

impaired, the Claimant, relying on the tribunal’s decision in Saluka,** suggests that any negative

impact on investment is sufficient to constitute an impairment.**

In the present case, the Claimant contends that irrespective of the additional 24% share purchase

 

inN ber 2013, after the installation of the ei its project was signi ly
impaired since the Respondent’s measures severely damaged the SPV’s value by delaying the
payment of and impairing the value of the SPV’s outstanding loan repayment, and the Claimant
lost an opportunity to sell the shares at a reasonable price that it expected at the time of the

additional purchase.**>

(b) The Respondent’s Position
The Respondent argues that the amendment measures were reasonable and appropriate and that
therefore they do not amount to a violation of the Non-Impairment Standard.**° The Respondent
rejects the Claimant’s argument that any negative effects on investments, however minor, satisfy
the impairment requirement.**’ In the Respondent’s view, the impairment must be “significant”
before it can amount to a violation of the treaty standard.** A mere imposition of tax measures

or a simple repeal of a tax exemption is not sufficient to satisfy this requirement.*?

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant fails to establish any such significant impact. The

Claimant “was free to use the solar power plants to generate substantial revenue” even after the

introduction of the amendment measures.**!

The Respondent also points out that the Claimant’s
plants continue to enjoy the 15-year payback period and the 7% return rate despite the Taxation

Measures.*“

Moreover, the Respondent objects to the Claimant’s argument that the Tax Measures
significantly impacted on the loan repayment, pointing out that the SPV had repaid six out of
seven loans from the Claimant before the installation of the Tax Measures.*® Furthermore, the
Respondent submits that the Claimant’s additional 24% share purchase in November 2013, at a
price approximately eight times higher than the normal price, is at odds with the Claimant’s
argument that the Taxation Measures severely affected its project value and deprived it of its
sales opportunities.*™ Finally, the Respondent asserts that the impairment, according to the text
of the treaty, must be related to the “management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of
the purported investment”,*® and that the Claimant has not provided evidence for any such

relationship. Rather, it has focussed solely on the alleged diminution of the plant’s value.‘

2. Whether the Respondent’s Measures were Arbitrary or Discriminatory
(a) Whether the Respondent Pursued a Rational Policy
(1) ~~ The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that in order to establish a violation of the Non-Impairment Standard, the
Tribunal should apply a “means-to-an-end” reasonableness test to analyse the reasonableness of
the Respondent’s measures: a State’s measure is reasonable if (1) the State pursues a rational

policy; and (2) the State acts in a reasonable manner when implementing the policy.*””

Relying on AES,** the Claimant explains that (1) a policy is rational “if it is taken ‘following a
logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter’”; and

(2) an implementation measure is reasonable “if there is ‘an appropriate correlation between the

state’s policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it”.

In relation to the first prong of the reasonableness test, the Claimant rejects the argument that,
since the purpose of the adopted measures was to eliminate excessive profits and to relieve
consumers and the State budget of an additional burden, the Respondent pursued a rational policy.

This is for a number of reasons.*”

First, the Claimant alleges that the Incentive Regime did not give rise to windfall profits.*”! The
photovoltaic investors only received a 10-15% return, which is consistent with return rates in
other EU markets.*” In this vein, the Claimant emphasizes that the explanatory report on Act No.

402/2010 Coll., which introduced the Solar Levy, did not speak in terms of windfall profits.*”

Second, according to the Claimant, since “the Respondent facially destroyed the Claimant’s
rights and interests”, the Respondent has to prove that “the maintenance of the Incentive Regime,
and the allegedly resulting high electricity prices, would have entailed the catastrophic
consequences for the Czech economy”, in order to demonstrate the rationality of its policy.6™
However, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has not shown that any specific harm existed
at the time of the adoption of the measures.*” On the contrary, the extra cost per unit for RES
support, and the growth in electricity tariffs and electricity prices were low in the Czech Republic
when the amendment measures were adopted.*”° Industrial production in the Czech Republic was
growing in 2010.” The budget deficits of the Czech Republic were at the lowest level among
the EU Member States.*’* The Claimant also notes that host States may not intervene in, or
interfere with, private investments “simply in the name of purported threats of its national

economy”.*”

Third, according to the Claimant, the Respondent’s policy was not rational as there was no urgent
need to change the Incentive Regime, on which the Claimant relied, before the EC had
intervened.‘ In support of this argument, the Claimant relies on the award in AES," in which
the tribunal found that Hungary was not obliged to limit potential State aid before the EC issued
its decision.** In the Claimant’s view, Professor Stern’s dissent in AES is not pertinent in the

present case, as the EC did not put pressure on the Czech Government in the case at hand.“

Fourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s policy retroactively to withdraw the
promised profits led to the Czech Government losing its international reputation as a profitable
destination for foreign investment.“ This is further proof of the irrationality of the Respondent’s
policy, because without foreign investment the Respondent will likely fail to meet the EU’s 2020

still bound. **

Fifth, the Claimant adds that if there were any alleged windfall profits, they were caused by the
Respondent’s policy choice to enact the Incentive Regime and the Respondent’s failure to

calculate the relevant costs properly.**°

(2) The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, a measure is reasonable, if it is reasonably connected to a rational
policy.**’ The Respondent notes that the general presumption is that a State’s exercise of its
regulatory power will be reasonable and that this test does not require or, in fact, entitle the

Tribunal to second guess a State’s policy or a measure that it seeks to introduce.***

The Respondent submits that a host State’s policy is rational “if it has been adopted “following a

 

  

logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.””**? In

this regard, the Respondent objects to the Claimants allegation that the Respondent must prove

that “the Incentive Regime [...] would have entailed [...] catastrophic consequences for the
Czech economy”, alleging that no tribunal has requested a host State to prove that “near-
calamitous consequences would have occurred, but for the State’s intervention.” 8 The
Respondent also notes that tribunals have found a broad variety of policy objections to be
“rational”, including “the protection of consumers, accession to the European Union, and

regulation of the windfall gains of a certain sector.”*”!

With respect to the amendments to the Act on Income Tax, the Respondent argues that the repeal
of the Income Tax Exemption and the change of the Shortened Depreciation Period were based
on the desire to protect the State budget in the midst of a global economic crisis.” With regard
to the Solar Levy, the Respondent alleges that it introduced the Solar Levy, together with the
State budget subsidy, in order to alleviate the excessive burden on consumers by transferring
some of that burden to the excessively profitable photovoltaic producers.*” In this regard, the
Claimant’s argument that the solar boom did not impose an unsustainable burden on consumers
is unreasonable, because (1) consumers in the Czech Republic were paying a higher proportion
of their income on electricity than consumers in other EU States; (2) the Czech Republic’s
support per unit of RES generation was the highest among the EU Member States; and (3) the
Czech Republic spent a significant share, i.e., more than 0.5%, of State budget for photovoltaic

support."

In response to the Claimant’s argument that the rate of return in the Czech Republic was
consistent with that in other EU Member States, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant’s
comparison of WACC figures in the EU Member States is misleading, because (1) the Claimant
confuses post-tax and pre-tax rates; and (2) the Claimant does not distinguish between forms of

support systems.*?°

(b) Whether the Respondent Acted in a Reasonable Manner When Implementing
the Policy

(1) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues, further, that the Respondent acted in an unreasonable manner when
implementing the policy, stating that a host State’s measure can be reasonable only when (1) “its
adverse effects on foreign investments are limited to what is strictly necessary to achieve the
public interest”; and (2) “the public interest outweighs the negative impact on the rights of foreign
investors in the specific case.”*°* In the present case, the Claimant argues that the contested

measures do not satisfy either of these requirements.”

The Claimant argues that the Solar Levy did not correct the increase of electricity prices, because
it served only modestly to reduce electricity bills by 3.6% for private households and 4.3% for
medium size industries.*°* With respect to the repeal of the Income Tax Exemption and the
change to the Shortened Depreciation Period, the Claimant states that the Respondent does not
sufficiently explain how these measures were meant to address the rise in electricity prices. *”
On the other hand, in the Claimant’s view, the measures had significantly negative effects on
photovoltaic investors.” For example, and most relevant to this case, the sale of the Claimant’s

plant became impossible after the measures were introduced.°”!

Finally, according to the Claimant, the Respondent was the first EU Member State that employed
the retroactive measures to deal with the solar boom.*? The Claimant argues that the
Respondents retroactive changes to the Incentive Regime constituted bad regulatory practice
which could have been avoided if the Respondent had followed the path taken by at least eight
other EU Member States, i.e., by addressing the solar boom with measures that apply only to
future investments.” In this vein, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s “retroactive”

measures were criticized by the EC, citing the EC’s letter to the Czech Ministry of Industry and

(2) The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, a measure is reasonable if the measure is “appropriately tailored”
to meet the policy.°’> The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s burden to prove a violation of
the Non-Impairment Standard is particularly high, because of “a presumption of validity in favour
of legislative measures adopted by a State.”** In addition, the Respondent submits that tribunals
in other cases, in which fiscal legislation that was aimed at the elimination of windfall profits

played a role, have found the measures to be reasonable.”

The Respondent submits that the reasonableness test should be distinguished from a balance test
and that, to establish a reasonable relationship, the benefits derived by a host State from a measure
do not need to outweigh the negative impact on investors.” The Respondent also notes that the
“appropriate tailoring” requirement is not a strict scrutiny test and that State measures do not

need to be strictly necessary for the pursuance of the policy to qualify under the test.°”

In the instant case, the Respondent states that the amendment measures were meant to address
negative impacts arising out of the unanticipated increase of solar investments in the middle of
the financial crisis.°"° To address this problem, the Czech authorities (1) allowed investors to
receive a reasonable rate of return; (2) imposed a tax on excessive returns; (3) levelled the playing
field for all RES producers; (4) levelled the playing field for overly profitable PV producers; and
(5) offered a tax deferral to photovoltaic producers faced with a serious financial risk.’!! These

measures were implemented to correct good faith mistakes in the design of the original scheme.””*

State budget caused by the installation of solar power plants and to allow photovoltaic investors
to continue to enjoy the expected benefits of the 15-year simple payback and the 7% return rate.”"*
The Tax Exemption was not economically justifiable, because, without it, the photovoltaic
installations were still sufficiently profitable and the 2010 EU target was achievable.°!* The

Shortened Depreciation Period was not originally designed specifically to support solar power

 

producers, since solar panels were originally categorized as an unclassified asset in the residual

category.°!* The changes to the depreciation period were intended to address an abuse of the

measure by PV investors.°!°

To support its view, the Respondent submits that Czech domestic courts have confirmed that the
amendment measures served the public interest.’!” Furthermore, the Respondent alleges that the
Taxation Measures only targeted photovoltaic energy producers, which received imbalanced
excess profits in relation to the dropped installation costs.”'* In the Respondent’s view, these solar

producers should have been aware of the possibility of modifications in the investment scheme.°!°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that since the amendment measures were
unprecedented, different from other States’ measures, and constituted bad practice, they were
unreasonable.” On the contrary, the Respondent submits that the measures were economically
effective and that other EU Member States adopted comparable measures.” In this regard, the
Respondent emphasizes that EU Member States had little experience of support for the

photovoltaic sector and therefore managing the photovoltaic sector was difficult.°°? Moreover,

 

the Respondent notes that the novelty of a measure is irrelevant to the reasonableness analysis.°>

measures could have been better designe: Referring to Mesa Power,’ the Respondent further
submits that the mere fact that a measure taken by a State does not achieve its intended objectives

does not make the measure unreasonable.””°

Finally, the Respondent submits that legislation does not become unreasonable simply because
States enact it quickly.”’ In any event, the Respondent states that it carefully tailored the

amendment measures with the benefit of the work of an inter-ministerial committee, through

 

commissioning studies and by review in parliamentary sessions.” In addition, the Respondent
points out that the Claimant argues on the one hand that the Respondent should have reacted to
the solar boom quickly, while, on the other hand, it states in the present context that the
Respondent should have devoted more time to the consideration of the measures before enacting

the legislation.°”?

3. Whether the Respondent’s Measures were Intrinsically Unreasonable

(a) The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant alleges that the repeal of incentive assurances was intrinsically unreasonable, °*°
especially when, as here, the Respondent first promised a long-term incentive regime to meet a

certain policy goal, and then repealed the promised incentive in relation to existing investors.”*!

In addition, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s measures were irrational, because they
changed the fundamental features of the Incentive Regime.’ In support of its argument, the
Claimant relies on the general principle articulated in Charanne®™ that “the existence of a

guaranteed tariff throughout the lifetime of the facility is an essential characteristic of an incentive

regime.” The Claimant contends, however, that the actual conclusion of the tribunal in
Charanne does not apply to the present case, since the claimants in Charanne invoked an
unreasonably long 30-50 years guarantee period, and the tribunal in that case emphasized that the

decision was based on case specific circumstances.°**

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the Taxation Measures are unreasonable,
because they had the effect of withdrawing the promised incentives.°*° According to the
Respondent, a breach of a promise, in the absence of other aggravating circumstances between a

host State and the investor(s), is not per se unreasonable.*”

The Respondent argues that the Solar Levy did not repeal the fundamental features of the
Incentive Scheme, because the Scheme was not meant to stabilize the FiT level and therefore the
FiT level itself did not constitute a fundamental feature of it. Furthermore, the Claimant has still
been receiving the FiT. The Respondent relies on the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court,

which concluded that the Solar Levy did not alter the RES scheme.**

In addition, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not provided any evidence to support
its position that the amendment measures were part of a pre-planned mechanism by which the
Respondent repealed the incentives, once it became likely it would achieve the 8% Indicative
2010 Target.?”

4. Whether the Respondent Acted in an Inconsistent Manner

statements given to investors and in respect of its ultimate policy goal.™”

made between | January 2009 and 31 December 2010.™' With respect to the policy goal, the
Respondent first attempted to achieve its EU target for both the years 2010 and 2020, 8% and
13% respectively.” However, the Respondent’s retroactive measures then made it impossible
to achieve the 2020 goal, because the Respondent lost international credibility after the

amendment measures.”

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Resp ismi the Claimant’s that, since the Respondent’s measures were
“inconsistent”, the measures were unreasonable.** According to the Respondent, whether a State
measure is objectively arbitrary should be assessed by the reasonableness test as indicated above,
and according to which the Respondent’s measures must be considered reasonable as

appropriately tailored instruments to address the solar boom.™**

5. Whether the Respondent Contributed to the Rise of the Solar Boom
(a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent cannot justify its amendment measures, since the
allegedly excessive burden on consumers and the State budget, arising out of the rapid increase
in solar investments, was caused by the Respondent’s own conduct.’*° The Claimant submits that
Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts 2001 provides that a State cannot invoke the necessity defence, if it “has
contributed to the situation of necessity” and that this general rule should apply in the present

case.”

In the Claimant’s view, the Act on Promotion, especially the 5% rule, cannot be regarded as a
good faith mistake; rather it was the Respondent’s active policy choice to attract investors.“
Since the Respondent was well aware in October 2009 that a significant number of photovoltaic
power plants would be installed in 2010, it had enough time to react promptly and to issue a

warning to discourage prospective investors, such that retroactive changes to the Incentive

Scheme would not have become necessary.“ As support for this, the Claimant submits that Mr.
Jones, the Respondent’s expert, accepted that it was “relatively easy to estimate” the costs on
consumers and that the Czech Technical University predicted a drop of installation costs by more
than 50%.°*° Rather, in the Claimant’s view, the Respondent used the rapid increase in the

installation of solar plants in order to meet the 8% Indicative 2010 Target.”*!

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s position that the solar boom was caused by the
982

Respondent’s mismanagement.
The Respondent submits that the rapid increase of solar installations was unpredictable, given
the novelty of the photovoltaic technology and the dramatic fall in the cost of the photovoltaic

module.**

The Respondent alleges that it reacted to the solar boom in a practical and timely manner, stating
that the caretaker government, which was in place between May 2009 and July 2010, lacked
authority to implement politically contentious legislative changes.” The moratorium for grid
connection in February 2010 was also timely, because the Czech Government needed to obtain
sufficient data before imposing it.°* In the Respondent’s view, photovoltaic energy investors
rushed into the market to take advantage of the 5% rule when it became known that the Czech

Government was considering its abolition.”

In any event, the Respondent notes that the Claimant’s reference to Article 25(2)(b) of the Draft
Articles on State Responsibility is misplaced, because the Respondent has not invoked the

necessity defence.°>”

introduction of the Solar Levy amount to violations of the prohibition of arbitrary and

discriminatory treatment.

As a preliminary matter, there is considerable disagreement between the Parties as to whether the
impairment in question was “significant” enough for a violation of the treaty standard or whether
any negative impact on foreign investment, whatever its magnitude, is sufficient to constitute an
actionable treaty violation. In the Tribunal’s view, an impairment needs to be substantial in order
to constitute a treaty breach. This proposition, however, need not be developed here, since, in the

Tribunal’s view, the determinative question is not whether the impairment was s

 

ibstantial, but

 

whether the challenged measures were promulgated in pursuit of a rational policy and were

implemented in a reasonable manner.

The Parties seem to agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that the relevant test to assess the rationality
of a policy is that cogently articulated by the tribunal in AES as follows: “A rational policy is
taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a
public interest matter.”°** In addition, the challenged measure must also be reasonable. As
stipulated by the tribunal in AES in words with which the Tribunal is in full agreement, “an
appropriate correlation between the state’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to

achieve it” must exist.°”

In essence, the Respondent has argued that the amendments relating to taxation were motivated
by the State’s desire to safeguard the State budget in the midst of a global economic crisis. The
Solar Levy was introduced, together with a State budget subsidy, to lower a perceived excessive
burden caused by energy costs on consumers and to share it with what the Respondent considered
(and siders) to be

 

electricity p

Pp P

The Tribunal finds that a “balancing” policy whereby electricity prices are lowered for the benefit
of the general public and there is an equivalent diminution in excessive profits of PV investors,
such that an excessive burden put on consumers might be alleviated, qualifies as a rational policy
within the meaning of the above-referenced definition. Having carefully considered all the
circumstances, the Tribunal finds the Respondent’s explanation plausible. It concludes that the

challenged measures were clearly aimed at addressing a public interest matter.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent also acted in a reasonable manner when implementing

the challenged measures. First, the Tribunal notes that it was expected that the FiT and the Green

Bonuses would be reduced by 30% in 2011 once the 5% break out rule was abolished. In this
context, a Solar Levy for existing plants of 26% is certainly reasonable. More importantly, even
after the Solar Levy reduced excessive profits, a reasonable return remained available for PV
investors. In 2010, without the legislative amendments, the reference plant would have received
a full payback in 7.8 years.°” Following the amendments, a payback could still be achieved in
10.8 or 11.4 years, and therefore well below the promised 15 years. The return for the reference
plant without amendments would have been 11.4% in 2010, while the return with the
amendments amounted to 8.4% in 2010, and therefore was exactly in line with or well above the
promised 7% return rate.°*' In other words, despite the amendment measures, PV investments
were as profitable — and in fact more profitable — than promised. Put shortly, the Solar Levy,
contrary to the Claimant’s argument, did not undermine the fundamental features of the Incentive
Scheme. The Incentive Scheme guaranteed that eligible solar PV plants could expect a FiT that
allowed a 15-year payback and a 7% rate of return over a period of 15 years. The Respondent did

not breach these promises.

In this context, it is also worth noting that while the return for the reference plant decreased by
3%, electricity bills decreased by 3.6% for private households and 44.3% for medium industries.

As a consequence, PV producers lost rather less, comparatively, than electricity consumers won.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that neither the introduction of the Solar Levy, nor
the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives was unreasonable or arbitrary in the given circumstances.
Whether, with the benefit of hindsight, there might have been a better way to address the
problems caused by the rapid increase in the number of solar installations in the Czech Republic
and the ensuing rise in electricity prices, is not a matter for the Tribunal to decide, but it is an

issue that falls within a State’s legislative discretion.

Having considered all materials and submissions before it, the Tribunal therefore concludes that
the challenged measures did not impair the Claimant’s investment in an arbitrary or

discriminatory manner.

First Peer Report, para. 4.8.1: the pay back for the Claimant would have been without amendments 8.8
years with the Claimant’s inputs and 8.3 years with adjusted inputs years and was 8 years with amendments,
i.e., also well below the promised 15 years.

First Peer Report, para. 4.8.3: The return for the Claimant would have been 9.7% with the Claimant’s
inputs and 10.5% with adjusted inputs 6.6% with the Claimant’s inputs and 7.3% with adjusted inputs in
2010, i.e., also well above the promised 7% return rate. All measures together reduced the return for the
2009 reference plant from 8.4% to 7%, Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 230:8-18.

COSTS

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

The Claimant submits that its total costs amount to EUR 307,599.87, which includes the
arbitration deposit of EUR 100,000.00 to date.°?

The Claimant posits three different scenarios for the outcome of the arbitration, which would
have an impact on the allocation of costs. According to the Claimant:
(i) in the event that the Claimant prevails on the merits (Scenario 1), it should be awarded

the costs of this arbitration, including the “costs of legal representation and assistance”
pursuant to Article 38(c) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules;

(ii) in the event that the Claimant prevails on jurisdiction, but not on the merits (Scenario
2), the Claimant should be awarded the costs of this arbitration, including the “costs of
legal representation and assistance”, relating to the Respondent’s objections to the
jurisdiction, but it should not bear any of the Respondent's costs relating to the merits,
because the claim is a bona fide claim, raising complex issues, while the Respondent
delayed and hindered the adjudication of the dispute; and

(iii) _ in the event that the Respondent prevails on jurisdiction (Scenario 3), it is nonetheless
reasonable that the Claimant should not bear any of the Respondent’s costs (including
the Respondent’s costs for legal representation and assistance), because the claim is a
bona fide claim, raising complex issues, while the Respondent delayed and hindered the
adjudication of the dispute. 9
The Claimant recalls that the principles with respect to the allocation of costs in the present
arbitration are set out in Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules. As for the costs of the
arbitration, Article 40(1) contains the general rule that “costs follow the event”, pursuant to which
a losing party bears the costs, but which also allows the arbitral tribunal to employ a different
approach, taking into account “the circumstance of the case”.°* As for the costs of legal
representation, Article 40(2) provides the tribunal a broader discretion to decide the allocation of
the costs.°°
In scenario 1, the Claimant submits that the Respondent should bear both the costs of arbitration

and the costs of legal representation and assistance of the Claimant.” For the costs of arbitration,

this follows from the “costs follow the event” rule.*® As for the costs of legal representation, the
Claimant alleges that an application of the “cost follow the event” rule would also be appropriate
considering the circumstance of the case.” While the Claimant says that it submitted bona fide
claims and adopted cost-effective approaches, the Respondent unnecessarily increased the
Claimant’s costs by refusing the adjudication of the claims in a single consolidated arbitration;
provoking the EC’s investigation of the Incentive Regime in relation to plants connected before
2013; and by including jurisdictional arguments in its Rejoinder submission in breach of the
procedural timetable.°” Moreover, since quantum constituted only a small portion of the entire
arguments, whether the entirety, or only a portion, of the damages claimed were awarded would
be irrelevant to the cost allocation.°”' In addition, the Claimant bore the burden of proof regarding
several novel and complex issues for which no precedent existed.” The Respondent must also
bear the costs of the Achmea phase, given that the jurisdictional objection was raised at a late
stage in the proceedings.” Finally, the Respondent must bear the costs associated with the

unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Beechey.”™*

In scenario 2, the Claimant should be awarded its costs relating to the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections and should not bear the Respondent’s costs on the merits.°” The “costs follow the
event” rule applies to both non-legal and legal costs as it does in scenario 1, as the Claimant
would be the prevailing party on jurisdiction.” With regard to the merits, the Claimant submits
that the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from the “cost follows the event” principle.
For example, while the Claimant’s claims were bona fide, the Respondent obstructed the
proceeding by, inter alia, “raising overly complex — but totally unhelpful — EU State Aid law

defenses.””””

In scenario 3, the Claimant submits that it should not bear any of the Respondent’s costs.””* The

Claimant alleges that the “costs follow the event” rule should not be applied by the Tribunal,

given the procedural behaviour of the Parties more fully described above.”

The Claimant submits that its legal costs are reasonable pursuant to Article 38(e) of the
UNCITRAL Rules.**’ The Claimant alleges that it “ran the case with a small legal team, relied
on expert evidence only where strictly necessary, and divided essentially all costs with the other
nine claimants.””*! The Claimant adds that if the Respondent’s legal costs exceed those of the

Claimant, any excess amount would be unreasonable.°*”

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent requests that should it prevail in the arbitration, the Tribunal order the Claimant
to pay all of the Czech Republic’s costs and expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding
(including attorney fees and expenses), in the amount of USD 1,246,817, as well as the Czech
Republic’s share of the costs incurred by the Tribunal and the PCA, in the amount of EUR
100,000 to date.”**

The Respondent has divided its costs and expenses equally among PCA Cases 2014-19, 2014-
20, 2014-21 and 2014-22, estimating “that the share of costs devoted to each of these matters has

been roughly equal.”°**

According to the Respondent, the costs of the arbitration should be allocated on the basis of the
“loser pays” or “costs follow the event” principle pursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL
Rules. Accordingly, the Tribunal should issue “an award of reasonable costs in favour of the
prevailing party”. °** With respect to the costs of legal representation, the Respondent
acknowledges that Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules “confers on the Tribunal broad
discretion to determine any reasonable apportionment of such costs in light of the circumstances

of the case”."*°

In the Respondent’s view, the “loser pays” principle does not only apply to arbitration costs, but

also to the costs of legal representation despite the difference in wording between Articles 40(1)
and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. It refers the Tribunal to the decision in ECE
Projektmanagement GmbH et al. v. The Czech Republic, which ruled that “the relevant criteria
are in both cases essentially the same, and include in both cases the extent to which the successful
party has succeeded on the principal question in issue in the dispute.””*’ The Respondent further
alleges that the application of the “loser pays” principle “is not limited to the context of ‘abusive’

or ‘frivolous’ claims.”***

Under the “loser pays” rule, a party may be considered the “prevailing party” if it “has prevailed
on all or only some of the issues in the case, i.e., that party’s ‘relative success’”.**” The concept
of “relative success” should only be employed, however, if “a tribunal has genuine difficulty in
identifying the prevailing party.” Based on this understanding, the Respondent considers that
it would be the “prevailing party”, if it “defeated all of the claims (whether on merits or
jurisdiction)”.**' In such case, so argues the Respondent, it “should be awarded most or all of its

reasonable costs”.

The Respondent emphasises that the Tribunal may depart from the “loser pays” principle in
situations where a prevailing party “caused an unnecessary aggravation of costs through its
conduct in the proceedings (e.g. deficiencies in its presentation of the case or obstructive

behavior)”.

Against this background, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has caused such an
“unnecessary aggravation of costs”. The Claimant, for example, (1) submitted “massively

overbroad document production requests”;°>

 

(2) disclosed funding sources of its investment in

claimant to bear arbitration costs and the respondent’s legal costs;°°° and (3) “pursued a
convoluted and ever-changing approach to the quantification of alleged damages” and “even
submitted a highly unusual supplemental expert report” which presented new arguments and

required the Respondent to expend considerable resources in order to respond to it.”

Further, the Respondent submits that its costs are reasonable in amount, noting that its costs “are
as much as four times lower than the reported average costs of respondents in investment treaty
disputes.”°*

The Respondent also states that the reasonableness of its costs is supported by the following four
factors.°” First, the Respondent employed a number of methods to increase cost efficiencies by

“coordinating its submissions”, engaging “the same counsel team”, “coordinating submission
calendars and logistics with opposing counsel” among the six cases originally brought by a single
Notice of Arbitration, and “agreeing to the same tribunal and joint hearing” in PCA Cases 2014-
19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22.'%° Second, the case at hand has presented “a number of
complex factual and legal issues”.'"' Third, the present case is “of significant importance” to the
Czech Republic, given that “it could face a wave of additional claims if the decision in this case
were favourable to Claimant.”'”” Fourth, the present proceedings have become lengthy because
of a number of factors outside the Respondent’s control, such as the EC’s attempt to intervene
and the Czech Republic’s replacement of counsel due to the public procurement rules.'" Lastly,
the Respondent claims that even “if [the Claimant] were to prevail on some or all of its claims”,

the Claimant should be required to bear its costs.!°

In respect of costs incurred in the context of the briefing on the Achmea judgment, the Respondent
argues that such briefing was “both necessary and entirely reasonable for the Czech Republic to

request” given that it was a “landmark development” and that “the pursuit of EU law-based

As regards costs incurred in connection with the challenge to Mr. Beechey, the Respondent

argues that it “was based on very real concerns”, “was not frivolous, vexatious, or dilatory” and

“was pursued promptly and efficiently”.'°%

Finally, the Respondent objects to the Claimant claiming reimbursement for “IPVIC’s internal
costs”, as there “is no reason for the Czech Republic to bear any share of the unspecified ‘internal’

costs incurred by a non-party to the proceedings.”"°””

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The Tribunal will first detail the arbitration costs and the costs for legal representation and

assistance of the Parties. It will then determine the apportionment of such costs.

1. Costs

Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its
award, providing a list of items that may be claimed as such costs. These items include the fees
and expenses of the Tribunal, the approved costs of witnesses and the reasonable costs for legal

representation and assistance.

The Tribunal estimates that it has spent roughly equal amounts of time and effort on PCA Case
Nos. 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22. It therefore considers it reasonable to divide its
costs and expenses, as well as the costs and expenses of the PCA, equally among the four

arbitrations as follows.

The fees of Mr. Gary Born, co-arbitrator until his resignation on 24 June 2018, amount to

EUR 31,912.50 and his expenses amount to EUR 749.72.

The fees of Mr. John Beechey CBE, co-arbitrator, amount to EUR 5,250. Mr. Beechey did not

have any expenses.

The fees of Mr. Toby Landau QC, co-arbitrator, amount to EUR 39,135.42 and his expenses
amount to EUR 653.49.

The fees of Professor Hans van Houtte, presiding arbitrator, amount to EUR 64,442.50 and his

expenses amount to EUR 121.50.

The costs of other tribunal expenses, including the costs of a court reporter, interpretation,

technician, catering, printing and courier charges, and others total EUR 20,142.84.
PCA fees amount to EUR 36,500. The PCA incurred no expenses.

Each Party paid advances on costs in the amount of EUR 100,000, i.e., a total advance of

EUR 200.000.

As for the Parties’ respective costs of legal representation and assistance, the Claimant’s costs
related to this arbitration amount to EUR 207,599.87. The Respondent’s costs related to this
arbitration amount to USD 1,246,817. Considering the complexity of this proceeding, the novel
issues of fact and law that have arisen in its context, and the fact that the costs relate to four

coordinated proceedings, both amounts appear reasonable.

2. Allocation of Costs

As correctly noted by both Parties, Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows with
regard to the allocation of costs:
1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each

of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such
costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable.

(a) The Costs of the Arbitration
As both Parties have recognised, Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules affords the Tribunal broad
discretion in matters of costs. Pursuant to Article 40(1), the unsuccessful party shall “in principle”
bear the costs of arbitration. Where no party clearly prevails, a common method to allocate costs
is to take account of the relative success of the claims and defenses. Another criterion that

tribunals frequently consider is the general conduct of a party throughout the proceedings.

As a first consideration, as far as the Parties’ success on their respective cases is concerned, the

Claimant has prevailed on jurisdiction, whereas the Respondent has prevailed on the merits.

As a second consideration, as far as the Parties’ conduct is concerned, the Tribunal considers that

counsel on both sides conducted this arbitration fairly and with high professional standards. None

Page 193 of 195

of the facts that would clearly justify an adverse cost allocation, such as bad faith, abusive or

unreasonable argument, obstructive or dilatory tactics etc., was present in this arbitration.

Accordingly, in line with the presumption contained in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules
and in the exercise of its discretion in matters of costs, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent

shall bear 25% and the Claimant shall bear 75% of the costs of arbitration.

The PCA shall therefore reimburse to the Respondent the unexpended balance of the deposit in
the amount of EUR 1,092.03. The Claimant is requested to reimburse to the Respondent the
amount of EUR 49,180.98 within six weeks of this Award.

(b) The Costs of Legal Representation and Assistance
Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules does not contain a presumption in favour of awarding the
costs of legal representation and assistance of the successful party. Instead, it provides that in

apportioning the costs, the Tribunal shall take account of “the circumstances of the case”.

The present arbitration was genuinely complex and raised difficult and novel issues of fact and
law, the outcome of which was uncertain. In particular, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s

claims, although ultimately unsuccessful, were reasonable.

In the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal therefore finds that in the circumstances of the
present case, it is fair for each Party to bear its own legal fees, costs, and expenses in this

arbitration, including fees, costs, and expenses related to expert and fact witnesses.

the sum of EUR 49,180.98.

(c) Each Party shall bear its own costs of legal representation and assistance.
