United States of America
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3)

DECISION ON RESPONDENT'S REQUEST
FOR A SUPPLEMENTARY DECISION

INTRODUCTION

1. On June 26, 2003, the Tribunal delivered its Award on Respondent's
motion of January 2002, including its decision on the merits.

2. By its Award on Respondent's motion, the Tribunal decided
unanimously: ‘

"(1) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine TLGI's claims under
NAFTA concerning the decisions of United States courts in
consequence of TLGI's assignment of those claims to a
Canadian corporation owned and controlled by a United States
corporation.

(2) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine Raymond L. Loewen's
claims under NAFTA concerning decisions of the United States
courts on the ground that it was not shown that he owned or
controlled directly or indirectly TLGI when the claims were
submitted to arbitration or after TLGI was reorganized under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

(3) | TLGI's claims and Raymond L. Loewen's are hereby dismissed
in their entirety.

(4) That each party shall bear its own costs, and shall bear equally
the expenses of the Tribunal and the Secretariat."

3. In its decision on the merits, the Tribunal concluded, again
unanimously ,
“that Loewen failed to pursue its domestic remedies, notably the
Supreme Court option and that, in consequence, Loewen has

FROM WB-1CS1D (MON) 9. 13°04 18:06/ST. 17:55/NO. 4861052710 P 4

not shown a violation of customary international law and a

violation of NAFTA for which Respondent is responsible"
and that

“the claims of Loewen and Mr Raymond Loewen should be

dismissed in their entirety’.

4, Material to the Tribunal's conclusions recited in the preceding
paragraph were the following paragraphs in the Decision:

“213, Entry into the settlement agreement no doubt reflected a
business judgment by Loewen that, of the various options then
open, settlement was the most attractive, in all probability
because it provided certainty. Other alternatives involved
financial consequences which would not have been easy to
predict.

214. Respondent argues that, because entry into the settlement
agreement was a matter of business judgment, Loewen
voluntarily decided not to pursue its local remedies. That
submission does not dispose of the point. The question is
whether the remedies in question were reasonably available and
adequate. If they were not, it is not to the point that Loewen
entered into the settlement, even as a matter of business
judgment. It may be that the business judgment was inevitable
or the natural outcome of adverse consequences generated by
the impugned court decision.

215. Here we encounter the central difficulty in Loewen's case.
Loewen failed to present evidence disclosing its reasons for
entering into the settlement agreement in preference to pursuing
other options, in particular the Supreme Court option which it
had under active consideration and preparation until the
settlement agreement was reached. It is a matter on which the
onus of proof rested with Loewen. It is, however, not just a
matter of onus of proof. If, in all the circumstances, entry into
the settlement agreement was the only course which Loewen
could reasonably be expected to take, that would be enough to
Justify an inference or conclusion that Loewen had no
reasonably available and adequate remedy.

216. Although entry into the settlement agreement may well have
been a reasonable course for Loewen to take, we are simply left
to speculate on the reasons which led to the decision to adopt

FROM WB-ICSID (MON) 9. 13°04 18:06/ST. 17:55/NO. 4861052710 P 5

that course rather than to pursue other options. It is not a case
in which it can be said that it was the only course which Loewen
could reasonably be expected to take.”

5. On August 11, 2003, Respondent filed a request for a Supplementary
Decision pursuant to art. 58 of the ICSID (Additional Facility) Rules. By the
its request, Respondent sought a supplementary decision clarifying the
Tribunal's disposition of Raymond Loewen's claims under art. 1116 of NAFTA.

PROCEDURE

6. The Tribunal, by letter dated August 22, 2003, invited Claimants to
submit observations on Respondent's Request on or before September 19,
2003.

7. Loewen, by letter dated September 17, 2003, informed the Tribunal
that it did not intend to submit comments on Respondent's Request.

8. On September 19, 2003, Mr John R. Lewis Jr and Ms Christina
Arangiosa of Montgomery, McCracken Walker & Rhodes LLP and Mr D.
Geoffrey Cowper QC of Fasken Martineau Du Moulin LLP filed submissions
as to Raymond Loewen's art. 1116 claim.

9. By letter dated November 27, 2003 the Tribunal informed the parties
that it would proceed to deal with Respondent's request for a supplementary
decision. The Tribunal directed Respondent to file a reply no later than
December 19, 2003 and Raymond Loewen to file a rejoinder no later than
January 9, 2004.

10. By that letter the Tribunal stated that it was then of the view that an oral
hearing would be unnecessary but reserved its position on that question until
it received the reply and rejoinder.

11. On December 19, 2003, the Attorneys for Respondent, Mr Mark A.
Clodfelter, Mr Barton Legum, Ms Andrea Menaker and Ms Jennifer Toole
(U.S, Department of State) and Messrs Joseph Hunt, Vincent M. Garvey and
Ronald V. Wiltsie Jnr (U.S. Department of Justice) filed Respondent's reply.

12. On January 9, 2003, Raymond Loewen's rejoinder was filed.

FROM WB-1CS1D (MON) 9. 13°04 18:06/ST. 17:55/NO. 4861052710 P 6

13. On the submissions presented by the parties, the question arises
whether an oral hearing is necessary. Respondent submits that an oral
hearing is unnecessary. We agree with Respondent on this point. The issue
raised by Respondent's request is clear and is to be resolved by reference to
the materials before the Tribunal, including the transcript of the oral hearing
on the merits, the Award, the request and the submissions which have been
filed. Nothing would be gained by a further oral hearing.

ARTICLE 58(1)

14. Article 58(1) provides:
“Within 45 days after the date of the award either party, with
notice to the other party may request the Tribunal, through the
Secretary-General, to decide any question which it had omitted
to decide in the award."

15. Article 58(1) reflects art. 49(2) of the ICSID Convention which provides:
“[t]he Tribunal upon the request of a party ... may ... decide any
question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall
rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award."

RESPONDENT'S CASE

16. | Respondent contends that, although the Award explicitly stated that all
claims (including Raymond Loewen's claims) were dismissed on the merits, it
did not state expressly that his art. 1116 claims were dismissed on the merits.

. Respondent concedes that the Award was not “silent” as to the question but
argues that further explication would resolve a minor ambiguity and that art.
58(1) extends to such a case.

R EN'S CA‘

17. | Raymond Loewen contends that the Tribunal omitted to decide his art.
1116 claim in the Award and that it is obligated to render a supplementary
decision under art. 58. Raymond Loewen submits that the Tribunal
overlooked the claim and that ,in the course of determining it now, the
Tribunal should consider whether its “obiter dicta" as to the merits require
correction, as Raymond Loewen argues.

FROM WB-ICSID (MON) 9. 13°04 18:06/ST. 17:55/NO. 4861052710 P 7

18. Central to the submission is the argument that paras 215-217 of the
Award are in error and that the Tribunal overlooked the declarations of Mr

Wynne S. Carvill and the Rt Hon John N. Turner. These declarations were
before the Tribunal and were relied upon by Claimants at the oral hearings.

DISCUSSION

19. We agree that, apart from the dismissal in the Award of June 26, 2003
of all the claims "in their entirety’, there is no distinct reference in the Award to
a discussion of Raymond Loewen's claim under art. 1116. We agree also
that, as there was no jurisdictional objection to his claim under art. 1116, that
claim fell to be determined by the decision on the merits.

20. But the dismissal of all the claims “in their entirety" following the
examination of the merits was necessarily a resolution of the art. 1116 claim.
That dismissal was a consequence of the reasoning expressed in paras 213-
216. We therefore reject the argument that the Award did not deal with the
art. 1116 claim. :

21, It follows that Respondent is correct when It argues that Raymond
Loewen is asking the Tribunal to reconsider its decision to dismiss that claim
and to reconsider the reasoning (described by Raymond Loewen as “obiter
dicta") which led the Tribunal to dismiss the claim. In the context of the
dismissal of Loewen's claims, that reasoning was not merely “obiter dicta". It
was the reasoning on which that part of the Award was based and it is not
open to the Tribunal to reconsider it. There is no logical basis on which the
Tribunal can draw a distinction between the relationship of that reasoning to
the dismissal of the Loewen claims on the one hand and to the Raymond
Loewen claim under art. 1116 on the other hand.

22. While the Cargill and Turner declarations were relied upon to support a
view contrary to that reached in paras 215-216 of the Award, they did not
satisfy us, in all the circumstances, that the settlement agreement was the
only course for Loewen to take. The declarations did not purport to present a
comprehensive record or account of TLGI's Board's consideration of the
option which it should pursue. Nor did the declarations record or identify the
information presented to the Board on which it arrived at its conclusion that it
should pursue the settlement option. The declarations did not ground an

FROM WB-1CS1D (MON) 9. 13°04 18:06/ST. 17:55/NO. 4861052710 P 8

inference that the settlement option was the only available alternative or that
certiorari petition and the bankruptcy petition were not available remedies.

CONCLUSION

23. The request should not be granted because Raymond Loewer's art.
1106 claim was dealt with.

ORDERS

1. The request is refused.
2. That each party shall bear its own costs and shall bear equally the
expenses of the Tribunal and the Secretariat.
