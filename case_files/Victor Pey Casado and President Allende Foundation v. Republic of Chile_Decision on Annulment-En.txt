INTRODUCTION

This case concerns an application for annulment (the “Annulment Application”) of the
award rendered on 13 September 2016, as rectified by the decision of 6 October 2017
(the “Resubmission Award”) in the arbitration proceeding (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2)
between Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation President Allende (together the
“Applicants” or the “Claimants”) and the Republic of Chile (“Chile” or the
“Respondent,” and together with the Applicants, the “Parties”). The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

The Resubmission Award was rendered by a tribunal composed of Sir Franklin Berman

(President), Mr. Alexis Mourre and Mr. V.V. Veeder (the “Resubmission Tribunal”).

The dispute in the original proceeding (the “First Arbitration”) was submitted by the
Claimants to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or
the “Centre”) on 7 November 1997 on the basis of the Agreement between the Kingdom
of Spain and the Republic of Chile for the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of
Investments entered into force on 29 March 1994 (the “BIT” or the “Treaty”) and the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of

Other States, dated 18 March 1965 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The dispute arose from the confiscation of the assets of two Chilean companies (Consorcio
Publicitario y Periodistico S.A. “CPPSA” and Empressa Periodistica Clarin Ltda “EPC
Ltda”) following the coup d’état led by General Augusto Pinochet in 1973. In the
arbitration, the Claimants alleged inter alia that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated
their investments in CCPSA and EPC Ltda and failed to accord them fair and equitable
treatment. In particular, the Claimants claimed that Chile discriminated against them and

denied them justice in connection with the request that Mr. Pey Casado filed with the

Chilean courts in 1995 seeking reparation for the confiscation of a Goss printing press (the

“Goss press case”).!

5. In an award dated 8 May 2008 (the “First Award”), the tribunal composed of Professor
Pierre Lalive, Mr. Mohammed Chemloul and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard (the “First
Tribunal”) dismissed the Claimants’ expropriation claim finding that the expropriation of
El Clarin (the Chilean newspaper published by CCPSA and EPC Ltda) was not covered
ratione temporis by the BIT. The First Tribunal also found that the Respondent had
breached Article 4 of the BIT due to its courts’ failure to render a decision in the Goss press
case for seven years (denial of justice) and due to its ministerial decision to award
compensation to persons other than Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation (the “Decision
No. 43”) (discrimination). After dismissing all other claims, the First Tribunal awarded the
Claimants USD 10,132,690.18 (plus compound interest) in damages, USD 2,000,000 in
legal fees and costs, and USD 1,045,579.35 in procedural costs.”

6. On 6 July 2009, the ICSID Secretary-General registered Chile’s application for annulment
of the First Award (the “First Annulment Proceeding”). On 18 December 2012, the ad
hoc committee composed of Professor Piero Bernardini, Professor Ahmed El-Kosheri and
Mr. L. Yves Fortier, (the “First Committee”) issued a decision partially annulling the First
Award (the “First Annulment Decision”). Specifically, the First Committee annulled
paragraph 4 of the dispositif of the First Award and the corresponding paragraphs in the

reasoning.?

7. On 18 June 2013, the Claimants filed a new request for arbitration pursuant to Article 52(6)
of the ICSID Convention (the “Resubmission Proceeding”). In the Resubmission
Proceeding, the Claimants argued inter alia that the daughter of Mr. Pey Casado (Ms. Coral

Pey Grebe) was the proper party to the Resubmission Proceeding (being the assignee of

' Resubmission Award, para. 11.
? First Award, Section X.

3 First Annulment Decision, para. 359.

Mr. Pey Casado’s shares in CPPSA and EPC Ltda),* and sought damages in the amount of
USD 150 million for the Respondent’s breaches of the BIT, plus costs.

The Resubmission Award was rendered on 13 September 2016. The Resubmission
Tribunal ruled that Ms. Coral Pey Grebe could not be a claimant in her own right in the
Resubmission Proceeding. By the same award, it further found that the Claimants failed to
prove any quantifiable injury due to a breach of Article 4 of the BIT (and thus no financial
compensation could be awarded on this account) and dismissed the Claimants’ claims for
unjust enrichment and moral damages. The Claimants were ordered to bear three quarters

of the arbitration costs.*

The Claimants applied for the rectification of four errors in the award of 13 September
2016 pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention. During the rectification proceeding,
the Claimants unsuccessfully requested that two of the members of the Resubmission
Tribunal (Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. V.V. Veeder) be disqualified. In a decision
rendered on 6 October 2017 (the “Rectification Decision”), the Resubmission Tribunal
rectified paragraphs 61, 66, 198, and paragraph 2 of the dispositif of the Resubmission

Award and ordered that the Claimants bear the costs of the rectification proceeding.°

In this annulment proceeding, the Applicants are seeking the annulment of the
Resubmission Award on the following grounds: (i) improper constitution of the
Resubmission Tribunal (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention); (ii) manifest excess of
powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); (iii) serious departure from a

fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention); and (iv) failure

+ The first page of the request for arbitration refers to the case as “Victor Pey Casado and Spanish Foundation President

Allende (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2) v. Republic of Chile.” However, at page 3 of the request, the Claimants are
identified as being Ms. Coral Pey Grebe and the Foundation President Allende.

to state the reasons on which the award is based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID

Convention).”

Request”).

ICSID Convention, Professor Philippe Sands, appointed by the Claimants, and Mr. Alexis
Mourre, appointed by the Respondent. Following a challenge by the Respondent, Professor
Sands informed the Centre by letter of 10 January 2014 that, while rejecting the grounds
for the challenge, he took the view that the proper course was to allow the proceedings to

continue without distraction, and accordingly relinquished his appointment as arbitrator.

On 13 January 2014, following the resignation of Professor Sands, the ICSID Secretary-
General notified the vacancy to the Parties and the proceeding was suspended pursuant to
Arbitration Rule 10(2). On the same date, the Tribunal consented to the resignation of
Professor Sands pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), and on 31 January 2014,
Mr. V. V. Veeder was appointed to fill the vacant place on the Tribunal in accordance with
Arbitration Rule 11(1) and the Tribunal was reconstituted on that date. Mr. Paul-Jean Le
Cannu was appointed Secretary of the Resubmission Tribunal on the same date, and was
later replaced in that office on 13 May 2014 by Mr. Benjamin Garel. Following a proposal
by the President, and with the agreement of the Parties, Dr. Gleider Hernandez was

appointed as Assistant to the President on 12 December 2014.

of costs and the Claimants filed a supplemental statement of costs.

On 9 June 2015, the Resubmission Tribunal took note of certain agreed corrections to the
hearing transcripts, and decided on the remaining corrections on which the Parties could

not agree.

On 18 September 2015, the Claimants sought the Resubmission Tribunal’s authorisation
to introduce into the record a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Chile on
14 September 2015, and on 28 September 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments

ceased to exist.??

By letter dated 27 October 2016, the Claimants submitted a Request for Rectification of
the Resubmission Award pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention (the “Request
for Rectification”). In that same letter, the Claimants made certain requests for inquiry
and disclosure by Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder, and further requested that the
rectification proceeding be suspended until the tribunal called upon to interpret the First
Award of 8 May 2008 in accordance with the Claimants’ request of 7 October 2016 had

issued its decision on interpretation.

By email dated 4 November 2016, the Respondent asked the Secretary-General of ICSID
for four weeks to file its response regarding the proper procedure to be followed in the

circumstances presented by the Claimants’ submissions.

By email dated 5 November 2016, the Claimants opposed the Respondent’s request for a

four-week time period.

On 8 November 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for

Parties to submit to the Tribunal their proposals regarding the procedure, conduct and

timetable of the rectification proceedings (the “Rectification Proceedings”).

By letter dated 10 November 2016, the Claimants submitted a request for suspension of
the Rectification Proceedings, pending disclosure of certain information by Sir Franklin

Berman and Mr. Veeder.

By letter dated 16 November 2016, the Resubmission Tribunal invited the Respondent to

By letter dated 17 November 2016, the Respondent asked the Resubmission Tribunal to
order the Claimants to submit a Spanish version of the Request for Rectification, and
requested a period of at least three weeks following receipt of the Spanish version of the
Request for Rectification to consider and submit to the Resubmission Tribunal its position

on the proposed rectifications.

By letter dated 18 November 2016, the Claimants reiterated their requests for disclosure

dated 27 October 2016 and 10 November 2016 to the Resubmission Tribunal.

By letter dated 21 November 2016, the Resubmission Tribunal took note of the references
in the Request for Rectification to further declarations touching the independence and
impartiality of Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder, and communicated to the Parties the
fact that the two arbitrators had already responded to the Secretary-General of ICSID on

these questions, and had nothing further to add.

By a second letter dated 21 November 2016, the Resubmission Tribunal rejected the
request filed by the Claimants for the suspension of the Rectification Proceedings. In the
same letter, the Resubmission Tribunal requested the Claimants to provide a Spanish
translation of the Request by 2 December 2016, and set the procedural timetable for the

Rectification Proceedings.

Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the “First Disqualification Proposal”).

Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were suspended until the First

Disqualification Proposal had been decided.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the Rectification Proceedings were once again suspended.

Claimants’ further proposals for disqualification as a proposal to disqualify a majority of
the Resubmission Tribunal, to be decided simultaneously by the Chairman of the
Administrative Council of ICSID in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention

(the “Second Disqualification Proposal’).

On 13 April 2017, the Centre informed the Parties of the Decision of the Chairman of the

suspensions of the Rectification Proceedings as set out above.

By letter dated 21 April 2017, the Claimants communicated a request to the Tribunal for

the discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44.

In an Order dated 24 April 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal set 1 May 2017 as the date
for the Respondent to state its position under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 with respect to the

Claimants’ request for discontinuance of the Rectification Proceedings.
On 6 October 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal rendered the Rectification Decision.
THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS BEFORE THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL AND ITS DECISIONS

The Claimants’ position before the Resubmission Tribunal is set out in detail in paragraphs
42 to 122 of the Award of 13 September 2016, and in paragraphs 37, 38, 40, 42 and 44 of

the Rectification Decision of 6 October 2017.

In essence, the Claimants submitted that Ms. Coral Pey Grebe was the proper party of the
Resubmission Proceeding (being the assignee of all of Mr. Pey Casado’s rights) and
claimed that the Resubmission Tribunal had jurisdiction over her under Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention.2! On the merits, the Claimants argued that the purpose of the
Resubmission Proceeding was only to establish the amount of damages due to them
because of the denial of justice and discrimination they suffered (which had been
determined by the First Tribunal)”
those damages.” As relief, the Claimants an award of EUR 11,156,739.44 and
USD 517,533 as well as legal costs.24

162. The Respondent’s position before the Resubmission Tribunal is described in paragraphs
123 to 270 of the Resubmission Award, and paragraphs 39, 41, 43 and 45 of the

Rectification Decision of 6 October 2017.

163. |The Respondent essentially argued that Ms. Coral Pey Grebe was not a proper party to the
Resubmission Proceeding (because Article 52 of the ICSID Convention provides that only
the parties of the original arbitration and annulment may resubmit the dispute to the new
tribunal) and that, in any case, the Resubmission Tribunal lacked jurisdiction ratione
materiae and personae over her. On the merits, the Respondent contested the calculations
and quantifications of damages presented by the Claimants and their expert, argued that
the Claimants had failed to satisfy their burden of proving damages, and objected to the
admissibility of a number of the Claimants’ claims.”° Accordingly, the Respondent sought

the dismissal of the Claimants’ claims and an award for costs and fees.”

164. In the Resubmission Proceeding, the Parties lengthily discussed the scope of the
Resubmission Tribunal’s mandate in light of the possible res iudicata effect of unannulled

parts of the First Award.
165. Inthe Resubmission Award, the Resubmission Tribunal decided as follows:

(1) That Ms Coral Pey Grebe cannot be regarded as a
claimant in her own right in these resubmission proceedings;

(2) That, as has already been indicated by the First Tribunal,
its formal recognition of the Claimants’ rights and its finding
that they were the victims of a denial of justice constitutes in
itself a form of satisfaction under international law for the
Respondent’s breach of Article 4 of the BIT;

(3) That the Claimants, bearing the relevant burden of proof,
have failed to prove any further quantifiable injury to
themselves caused by the breach of Article 4 as found by the
First Tribunal in its Award;

27 Resubmission Award, paras. 168-170.

(4) That the Tribunal cannot therefore make any award to the
Claimants of financial compensation on this account;

(5) That the Claimants’ subsidiary claim on the basis of
unjust enrichment is without legal foundation;

(6) That there are no grounds in the circumstances of the case
for the award of moral damages either to Mr Pey Casado or
to the Foundation;

(7) That the arbitration costs of these resubmission
proceedings are to be shared in the proportion of three
quarters to be borne by the Claimants and one quarter by the
Respondent, with the result that the Claimants shall
reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$159,509.43;

(8) That all other claims are dismissed.?*

166. In the Rectification Decision of 6 October 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal decided that:

(a) Paragraphs 61, 66, and 198, and paragraph 2 of the
dispositif, of the Resubmission Award are rectified as set out
in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, and 55 above.

(b) The costs incurred by the Centre in respect of these
Rectification Proceedings, including the costs resulting from
the associated challenges to Sir Franklin Berman and Mr
Veeder, shall be borne by the Claimants and the Claimants
shall therefore reimburse to the Respondent the sum of US$
22,963.36, in addition to the amount specified in paragraph
255 of the Resubmission Award. The Tribunal makes no
further order as to costs.”

27

1. Accept this [brief], and its documents attached, seeking
the annulment

i. of the whole resubmission Award notified on 13
September 2016, on the grounds of Article 52(1) of the
Convention, including points (a), (b), (d) and (e) thereof,
[and]

ii. the annulment of §§58, 61 and 62(b) of the Decision of
6 October 2017, on the grounds of points (b), (d) et (e)
of Article 52(1) of the Convention;

2. Order the Republic of Chile in due course to bear the costs
of this annulment proceeding and of incidental issues — such
as the one that arose on 12, 15 et 16 February 2018 — along
with the fees and expenses of the members of the ad hoc
Committee, the charges for use of ICSID facilities, the
translation expenses and the professional fees and expenses
of [the Applicants], lawyers, experts and/or any other
persons called upon to appear before the ad hoc Committee,
and pay the relevant amounts for any other infringements
established as the ad hoc Committee may deem fair and
equitable, with compound interest.

3. Adopt any other measures that the members of the
Committee consider fair and equitable in the circumstances
of this case.*°

168. In the Additional Request, the Applicants request:

[I]n order to preserve the integrity and the fairness of the
procedure, and given the nature and the seriousness of the
behaviour of the Respondent State on 12, 15 and 16 February
2018, its blatant bad faith, the non-rectification of its
behaviour by its representatives, but the complete contrary,
its deliberate amplification, that the ad hoc Committee
exercises its powers and that, in compliance with Rule 26 of
the IBA Guidelines on party representation:

13 (footnotes omitted); Annulment Application, para. 288; Applicants’ Submission on Costs, pp. 11 and 12 (clarifying
that the Applicants also seek the annulment of paragraph 7 (on costs) of the Resubmission Award). For the sake of
completeness, the Committee considers that the Applicants’ request for the annulment of the entire Resubmission
Award extends to the requests for annulment of specific paragraphs of the award mentioned in their briefs.

 

28

(a) That it draws appropriate conclusions in its reasonable
appreciation of the judicial evidence produced, as to the
evaluation of the fact that, against this evidence, on 12, 15
and 16 February 2018 Chile presented the reference made by
the Claimants in their submissions as deception, and to this
end, explicitly pejorative, the injunction of 24 July 2017 of
the 28th Civil Court of Santiago as being vacated since
October 2017;

(b) That it draws appropriate negative inferences from the
attempts by Chile’s representatives, with consumed
effrontery, to make the ad hoc Committee believe, with no
foundation and against all of the evidence, that the
Claimants’ representatives lacked professional ethics by
bluntly questioning the inaccuracy of the communication of
12 February 2018 submitted by the Defendant, and that such
supposed failures are abundant and proven, since the start of
the arbitration, without any evidence;

(c) That it sanctions the behaviour of the Republic of Chile
for its communications of 12 and 15 February and at the
hearing the following day by introducing and continuously
supporting inaccurate facts, infringing upon the honour and
the professional integrity of the Claimants, to the point of
getting the ad hoc Committee to warn that it was ready, after
deliberation, to also take measures against them by virtue of
Article 44 of the Convention, and to encourage a Claimant’s
counsel to rectify, at the request of Chile, an entirely founded
declaration produced in a circle of public debate;

(d) Warning to which the Claimants affirm, with a clear
conscience, to have never exposed itself today or in the past,
exclusive of the double deception in favour of which the
Defendant State designated its own qualities before the ad
hoc Committee on 12, 15 and 16 February, which
characterise more than twenty years of the present arbitration

(e) That it takes into account these facts in the allocation of
costs of the arbitration, by indicating if needed how and to
what extent they have led the Committee to a different
allocation of these costs;

29

(f) That it takes all other appropriate measures to preserve
the fairness and integrity of the procedure.*!

B. | THE RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

169. In the Counter-Memorial and the Rejoinder on Annulment, the Respondent requests that

the Committee:

a. [R]eject Claimants’ annulment request, in its entirety;

b. [O]rder Claimants to cover the costs of the Annulment
Proceeding in their entirety; and

c. [O]rder Claimants to reimburse Chile for the full amount
of its legal fees and expenses (with interest thereon, at a rate
of six-month LIBOR plus 2% per annum, starting from the
date of the Committee’s decision and until the date of
payment).*?

V. RULING CONCERI

  

3 THE ADDITIONAL REQUEST

170. Besides their requests for annulment of the Resubmission Award, the Applicants made an
application on 27 April 2018, reiterated in their Réplique of 9 November 2018,** asking
the ad hoc Committee to preserve the integrity and the equity of the proceeding by
sanctioning the Respondent for alleged bad faith and fraudulent behaviour in the conduct
of the case. The Applicants allege that they discovered a “modus operandi,” by which the
Respondent presents inexact and untrue facts “en vue de frustrer l’arbitrage” in general,
and in particular to induce the Committee, first, to believe that the Applicants acted against
tules of professional ethics, and, second, to draw the wrong conclusions with respect to the

outcome of the case.**

+! Additional Request, para. 21 (courtesy translation provided by the Applicants).

* Rejoinder on Annulment, para. 142. In the Counter-Memorial on Annulment, the Respondent also requested interest
on the cost of the proceedings (namely, under let. b. it sought “that the Committee order Claimants to cover the costs
of the present annulment proceeding, in their entirety (with interest thereon, at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2%
per annum, starting from the date of the Committee’s decision and until the date of payment)”).

38 Additional Request, pp. 9 s

The Applicants allege that the Respondent employed this modus operandi systematically
but refer explicitly to its allegedly false assertion that the courts of Chile “vacated” the
Applicants’ request for document production, where in reality, the request was still before
the Chilean courts. This alleged false information was to mislead the Committee before its
own decision on the Applicants’ document production request relating to the business

relations between Chile and the Essex Court Chambers.*>

The Applicants request that the Committee formally recognise that the Respondent’s
submission was fraudulent, that it draw negative inferences from this, that it state the
Applicants’ conduct was professionally correct, that it take the incident into consideration

when making its decision on costs

 

and that it take all appropriate measures to guarantee

the integrity and equity of the proceeding.*°

The Respondent refutes the accusations and insists that its presentation was correct and
that “[i]t is [the Applicants] themselves who misled the Committee, by asserting — falsely
— that Chile was in violation of a court-ordered obligation to produce documents to [the

037

Applicants].

The Respondent further submits that this is not the only incident where the Applicants
“accuse us of lying when they have been misrepresenting this issue for ten years.” The
Respondent refers to a judgment of a Chilean court,** which — according to the Applicants

—has stated ex officio the nullity of the Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975 (the “Decree

 

jo. 165”),°° where in reality the court has given effect to the Decree.*”

The Respondent asserts that “we never said that the proceeding was vacated. We said the

particular court order was vacated.””*!

The Respondent further asserts that at the time of the evidentiary hearing the case was still
pending before the Chilean courts and that therefore it is still under no obligation in Chile

to produce documents.

The Respondent requests the Committee to direct the Applicants to “cease and desist from
their accusations” and “to take this whole deplorable episode into account at the time of

awarding costs and legal fees.”*

The Committee has carefully studied the Parties’ submissions regarding the Chilean
proceedings and in particular the Respondent’s Second Submission on Preliminary Issues,
dated 12 February 2018, which is at the centre of the dispute at hand. The submission states
that while the Claimants appear to argue that the Committee’s intervention is “necessary

to give effect to a Chilean court order,” “the court order in question was vacated on
procedural grounds [...] and the Chilean courts currently are reviewing Claimants’
assertion.”“4 The text makes it clear, and the context further confirms, that the Respondent

only stated that the specific order had been vacated and not the whole proceedings.

The Committee does not find this statement to be misleading. In any event, it has not been
misled and understood that the “vacation” of one court order has not terminated the

proceeding before the Chilean courts with respect to document production.

As to the other controversial example quoted by both Parties, i.e. the judgment of the
1* Civil Tribunal of Santiago, the Committee has found that the judge discussed the issue
of absolute nullity of the Decree No. 165 and a possible imprescriptibility of claims for

confiscation in the conditional. The judge came to the conclusion, after detailed reasoning,

 

on (16 February 2018), p. 135.

that Mr. Pey Casado’s claim for restitution of the Goss printing machine was time barred
after 20 years. She confirmed thereby that Decree No. 165 had not been without effect

under Chilean law.**

The careful analysis of the judgment leads to the conclusion that the Applicants’ reference
to it is not correct. At the same time, the Committee was not misled because the Applicants

had exhibited the judgment and allowed for the proper appreciation.

Both Parties have presented their cases with vigour, passion and sometimes unevidenced
speculation on the state of mind and motivation of the other Party. The Committee has no
reason to consider that the Parties did not believe in the truth of these speculations. Be that
as it may, the Committee does not participate in the speculations and draws no inferences
from them. It can state with certainty that they have not influenced its decision, nor have
they led it to assume that either Party acted unprofessionally or in bad faith. Further, both

Parties have contributed to a normal and constructive procedure.

For these reasons, the Committee finds that the integrity of the proceeding has been
safeguarded and rejects the Parties’ requests for reliefs in connection with the Applicants’

Additional Request.

LEGAL STANDARDS

The First Committee devoted a comprehensive chapter on the legal standards of the three
grounds for annulment that had been asserted by the Respondent, i.e. a manifest excess of
powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a failure to state the

reasons on which the award was based.*°

Both Parties made the First Committee’s determination their own and refer to it repeatedly

and affirmatively.*” They have refrained from presenting repetitive textbook explanations

and off-the-shelf documentation and have condensed their presentations to a number of
basic, widely accepted and uncontroversial principles in order to establish the legal
framework of this Annulment Proceeding, even with regard to the fourth ground of
annulment, which was not asserted during the First Annulment Proceeding, i.e. the

improper constitution of the tribunal.

The Committee sympathises with the Parties’ approach, all the more so because it

subscribes to the First Committee’s analysis, which the Respondent summarises as follows:

With respect to “[t]he ground for annulment for manifest
excess of powers,” the First Committee stated that “this
ground is meant to ensure, inter alia, that tribunals do not
exceed their jurisdiction or fail to apply the law agreed upon
by the parties.” To justify annulment, “[a] tribunal (1) must
do something in excess of its powers and (2) that excess must
be ‘manifest.’ It is a dual requirement.” The phrase “excess
of powers” would include an “inappropriate [] exercis[e] of
jurisdiction (or failure to exercise jurisdiction); and [a]
fail[ure] to apply the proper law.” Nevertheless, “there is an
important distinction between a failure to apply the proper
law[,] which is a ground for annulment, and an incorrect or
erroneous application of that law, which is not a ground for
annulment.” For its part, the term “manifest” means
“sufficiently clear and serious.” If the tribunal’s conclusions
““seem tenable and not arbitrary, they do not constitute [a]
manifest excess of powers’”

Regarding the second ground for annulment — “that there
has been a serious departure from [a] fundamental rule[] of
procedure” — the First Committee “agree[d] with Chile that
this ground involves a three-part test: (i) the procedural rule
must be fundamental; (ii) the Tribunal must have departed
from it; and (iii) the departure must have been serious.” The
first part of the test requires identification of “procedural
tules that are essential to the integrity of the arbitral process
and must be observed by all ICSID tribunals. The parties
agree that such rules include the right to be heard, the fair
and equitable treatment of the parties, proper allocation of
the burden of proof and absence of bias.” The second part
(i.e., the “departure” prong) “requires that the Committee
examine the full record, including the Transcripts and the
Award [,] to determine whether or not the Tribunal violated

34

the rule in question.” The third part of the test — the
“seriousness” prong — requires “that the applicant must
demonstrate ‘the impact that the issue may have had on the
award.’” The committee must “enquire whether, if the rule
had been observed, there is a distinct possibility (a ‘chance’ )
that it may have made a difference on a critical issue.”

The First Committee also stated that, in addition to the above
three prongs, there is a fourth, waiver-related issue to
consider: “Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 27 and 53, a
party may lose its right to object on the ground of a serious
departure from a fundamental rule of procedure if it has
failed to raise its objection to the tribunal’s procedure upon
becoming aware of it, or ‘promptly’ as mentioned in Rule
27.”

With respect to the issue of “failure to state reasons,” the
First Committee endorsed the statement of the Vivendi I
committee to the effect that “‘Article 52(1)(e) [of the
Convention] concerns a failure to state any reasons with
respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state
correct or convincing reasons.’” So long as “the reasons
given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues
that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the
point in terms of Article 52(1)(e).’” Further, “‘reasons may
be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions
differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must
be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they
express their reasoning.’” At bottom, the “[First] Committee
believe[d] that as long as there is no express rationale for the
conclusions with respect to a pivotal or outcome-
determinative point, an annulment must follow, whether the
lack of rationale is due to a complete absence of reasons or
the result of frivolous or contradictory explanations.”**

The Respondent’s summary also represents its position.

The Parties not only agree with the analysis of the First Committee, they also agree that
annulment proceedings are not to be equated to an appeal, which is obvious given the clear

wording of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention.*?
Beyond these fundamental principles, the Parties have discussed the following nuances.

With respect to the (im-)proper constitution of the tribunal (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID
Convention), the Applicants*® subscribe to the JCSID Secretariat’s Background Paper on

Annulment, explaining that the ground:

[I]s intended to cover situations such as a departure from the
parties’ agreement on the method of constituting the
Tribunal or an arbitrator’s failure to meet the nationality or
other requirements for becoming a member of the Tribunal*!

as well as to Professor Schreuer who states that:

[Q]uestions concerning the tribunal's proper constitution
might arise from dissatisfaction in the manner in which
challenges to arbitrators and alleged conflicts of interest
have been handled. [...] Appointment of an arbitrator who
manifestly does not possess these qualities [as required by
Art. 14(1) Convention] may be put forward as a ground for
annulment.

The Respondent does not disagree with these quotes but warns that Article 52(1)(a) is

concerned with the constitution and not the composition of the tribunal.*?

The Committee shares the quoted opinions. The distinction between constitution and

composition has to be determined under the concrete circumstances of the case.

With respect to a manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention),

 

the Applicants* expand on the First Committee’ s analysis by quoting decisions of previous
ad hoc committees such as Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela, which found that Article
52(1)(b) “covers the case where a tribunal exercises a judicial power which on a proper
analysis had not been conferred on it (or vice versa declines to exercise a jurisdiction which
it did possess).”*> The Applicants further assert that for an excess of powers to be manifest,

it must be both “obvious” and “serious.”°°

The Applicants assert that a tribunal commits a manifest excess of powers “en s’élevant
contre Uautorité de la chose jugée.’*’ ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) provides
unequivocally that the “new Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so

annulled.”
They rely on Amco v. Indonesia (II), where the committee found that:

“Tf the original award had only been annulled in part, the new

Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so

annulled.” If a new Tribunal reconsiders an issue not

annulled, it exceeds its power.>®
The Applicants also refer to the Resubmission Tribunal in the present case, which found
that “it would be a manifest excess of its own jurisdiction if the Tribunal purported to”
investigate afresh issues that “had been finally determined with the quality of res judicata

(or, in the French phrase used by the Committee, ‘autorité de la chose jugée’).”?

The Applicants agree that a misapplication, a misinterpretation or an erroneous application

of the law normally do not amount to a non-application of the proper law. However, they

assert that in cases of egregious error — as observed in Lahoud v. Congo — “une telle
mauvaise application ‘est d’une telle nature ou ampleur qu’elle équivaut objectivement

[...] @ une non-application’.”©

The Respondent observes that contrary to a failure to apply the proper law, an incorrect or

t.°! Further, the manifest

erroneous application of that law is not a ground for annulment
nature of the excess of power does not refer to the seriousness of the excess or to the
fundamental nature of the rule that has been violated, but to the ease with which it is
perceived. For an excess of power to be “manifest,” it must be perceived by the Committee
without a complex analysis. Accordingly, the Applicants’ alleged “contortions” ipso facto
signal the absence of a “manifest” excess of power.°? When a tribunal’s conclusions seem

tenable and not arbitrary, they do not constitute an excess of powers.

The Committee agrees that an “inapplication la plus absolue” of the law which is to be
applied in the circumstances of the case fulfils the requirement of an excess of power.
The Committee also agrees that an excess of powers that, in the words of Soufraki v.

766 whereas

UAE,® is “textually obvious and substantively serious” is “manifest,
conversely, the alleged excess which is difficult to perceive even with some degree of

analysis, or which has no substantively serious effect, does not qualify as “manifest.”

With respect to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d
of the ICSID Convention), the Applicants correctly expand on the First Committee’s

findings by specifying that “serious” and “fundamental” are cumulative requirements, so

essential requirement [...] any sign of partiality must be considered [...] ‘a serious

970

departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, as much so as conduct of the tribunal

by which it might pretend to hear the parties’ arguments and evidence but does not give

them serious consideration.”!

Finally, the Applicants align themselves with jurisprudence as summarised in CDC v.

Seychelles, according to which a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is serious:

[Where it is “substantial and [is] such as to deprive the party
of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to
provide.” In other words, “the violation of such a rule must
have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially
different from what it would have awarded had the rule been
observed.”

203. The Committee accepts the Applicants’ arguments, which are not contested by the
Respondent, as an expression of principle, being conscious of the fact that their application

to the facts may require a certain re-calibration.

204. With respect to a failure to state the reasons on which the award is based (Article 52(1)(e)
of the ICSID Convention), the Applicants follow the First Committee’s position after an

analysis of partly controversial annulment decisions as to “Je degré de contréle de la

 

 

motivation de la sentence.” They present, as matters of principle,” and the Committee

agrees, that:

- the committee “has to verify the existence of reasons as well as their sufficiency — that

they are adequate and sufficient reasonably to bring about the result reached by the

Tribunal — but it cannot look into their correctness;””>

- reasons must not be frivolous or truly contradictory, whereby the contradiction must be

serious enough “to vitiate the Tribunal’s reasoning [...] as a whole.””°

205. The Committee is mindful of its limited role to protect the propriety and integrity of the
proceeding and not to sit as a court of appeal. It is not authorised to qualify the Tribunal’s
reasoning as deficient, superficial or wrong, and inconsistencies between different parts of

the Resubmission Award do not amount to a lack of reasons, unless the contradiction is of

a kind that two arguments neutralise each other or “cancel each other out.”””

Finally, the Applicants contend that, given the seriousness of the Resubmission Tribunal’s
repeated violations of ICSID system’s integrity and propriety, the Committee has no choice

but to annul the Resubmission Award.

The Respondent disagrees and asserts’* — in quoting CDC v. Seychelles — that “a
Committee has discretion not to annul an Award even where a ground for annulment under
Article 52(1) is found to exist.””? This conclusion, the Respondent states, follows from
Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention which provides that ad hoc committees “have the

authority” to annul awards, but not an obligation to do so.

The Respondent is conscious of certain limits to the exercise of the discretion not to annul
an award, as expressed in CEAC v. Montenegro, where the committee held that the

discretion:

[I]s by no means unlimited and must take account of all
relevant circumstances, including the gravity of the
circumstances which constitute the ground for annulment
and whether they had — or could have had — a material effect
upon the outcome of the case, as well as the importance of
the finality of the award and the overall question of fairness
to both Parties.*°

However, the Respondent insists that the circumstances of the present case warrant
upholding the Resubmission Award. It underlines that the Applicants brought the case in
bad faith, never met their burden of proof for damages, rejected Chile’s efforts to
compensate for the injuries suffered during the military dictatorship, and have manoeuvred

to keep the dispute alive for more than 20 years.*!

The Committee agrees with the position of the CEAC committee, which is itself in line
with well-established case law,*? that committees should not automatically declare an
award annulled if one of the grounds for annulment is present but that they should exercise
their authority in weighing, in particular, the gravity of the circumstances which constitute
the ground for annulment and whether they had — or could have had — a material effect
upon the outcome of the case. As stated by Professor Schreuer, annulment should be
“contingent not only upon the presence of one of the defects listed in Article 52(1) but also
upon its material impact on one or both parties.”*? This implies that the sheer duration of
the proceeding cannot be taken as a criterion, in particular when both parties share the
responsibility for the delays, nor the relative success of one or the other party in the

previous stages.

The Committee will proceed in keeping these considerations in mind.

GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT
INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS
dd) The Background of the Dispute and Reasons of the Resubmission Tribunal

After the break-down of the military dictatorship and the re-establishment of democracy in
Chile, Mr. Pey Casado, a Spanish citizen, returned to Chile, his second home country, from
which he had been expelled by force at the beginning of the dictatorship. He sought redress
for the injury and injustice inflicted upon him by turning to the Chilean government,
Chilean courts, and international arbitration. These multiples démarches, as understandable
and legitimate as they may be, are evidently not synchronised. This has necessarily

contributed to the complexity of the case.

In this section, the Committee will set out the background and basic issues of the disputes

 

as it sees it. They relate to the specificity and complexity of the case, which crosscut the

structure of the requests for annulment and the defences against them, and which have been
present throughout the proceeding. Where appropriate, it will first make rulings on the

requests for annulment.

During their closing statement at the Hearing on Annulment, on 14 March 2019, the
Applicants explained the reasons for their perseverance in the dispute by insisting that it is
the legal and moral duty of any person injured to fight for their subjective rights and to
defend them and thereby objective justice against all odds, and that, by doing so, they

“defend the collective interests of the international law, of law in general.”*+

They contend that the military coup d’état led by Augusto Pinochet in 1973 and the ensuing
dictatorship, which ended in 1989 with the restoration of democracy, have unlawfully
deprived them of their investments and use of property and caused hardship and injury to
them. Personal belongings as well as business assets and shares in companies were first
physically seized in 1973 manu militari and then by a sham administrative act, the Decree
No. 165 of 10 February 1975. These unlawful and anti-constitutional acts were not capable

of terminating Mr. Pey’s legal title to ownership.®°

Throughout the different stages of the proceedings, Decree No. 165 has been a central
piece, “un enjeu principal”® of the Applicants’ arguments. They assert that it had a factual,
but never a legal existence since it contradicted fundamental principles of the Chilean
Constitutions of all times, that, therefore, it was null and void from the beginning and could

not have any legal effect, and that it has not extinguished their ownership rights. These

assertions were made before the First Tribunal,®” before the First Committee,** before the

1,89

Resubmission Tribunal,®° and before the present Committee.”

The Applicants insist that as injustice has been done and its effects are still present, they
have a moral and legal duty to themselves and to society to fight until justice is rendered

and the injury is compensated.”!

This deep conviction and indignation have led them to try every potential venue of
remedies to reach the same goal: before national courts in Chile and before international

arbitration tribunals, relying on both national and international laws.

As an interim result, Mr. Pey Casado has been compensated for the loss of his personal
belongings.” Chilean courts rejected the claim for restitution of the Goss printing machine
for being time-barred when it was brought in 1995, i.e. 20 years after Decree No. 165.°>
The 1* instance court did not deny the existence and effect of Decree No. 165. Rather,
Mr. Pey argued before the court that the decree was “entaché de nullité de droit public,
imprescriptible [et] incurable, qui provoque son inexistence juridique.”°* This was
disputed by the State which asserted that the decree had been enacted in accordance with
constitutional provisions applicable at the time, with the consequence that Mr. Pey’s
request was time-barred.*° The Court dismissed Mr. Pey’s argument, reasoning that his
claim was time-barred by calculating the relevant periods of time as from the enactment of

Decree No. 165.”° As to compensation for the confiscated shares in the Chilean companies

and especially El Clarin, the Claimants initiated the present proceeding and informed the
Chilean authorities by letter of 24 June 1999%” that they had opted for this alternative as a
“fork in the road” decision and would not pursue their claim under the Chilean

compensation Law No. 19.568, dated 23 July 1998.°8

220. The Resubmission Tribunal has rejected any pecuniary compensation although it recalls “a

subsisting obligation on the Respondent [...] for the redress of acknowledged past

injustices.””°

221. This statement echoes similar expectations formulated by the First Tribunal:

Quant a Vinvalidité des confiscations et au devoir
d’indemnisation, il y a lieu de rappeler aussi des
déclarations parfaitement claires de la défenderesse dans la

s’est pas été traduite dans les faits.'°°

222. According to the First Award, the Respondent has declared that:

These declarations of the most diverse actors all recognise that injustice has been done and
injuries were inflicted. At the same time, the Resubmission Tribunal dismissed the
Applicants’ request for compensation. The Applicants deduced from these seemingly
contradictory findings that the Resubmission Tribunal was driven by a “systematic bias”!
in the conduct of the proceeding, in its reasoning and finally, in its decision to the detriment

of the Applicants.

They assert that this was only possible by systematically disregarding the binding force,
the res iudicata effect of the non-annulled parts of the First Award,!°? and by speculating,
allowing the Tribunal’s position to be “dictée par une écoute du Tribunal” accommodating
Chile’s wishes.'™* The reproach is recurrent and repeated in paragraphs 55-63, 105-106 of
the Reply on Annulment, in paragraphs 277, 305, 321, 335-349, 359, 397 ss., 431 ss., 468
s., 507-549, 550 ss., 558 ss., 598, 614, and 647 of the Memorial on Annulment, and in
paragraphs 7, 8, 84, 174, 176-185, 200, 207 ss., 221-226, 238, 239, 250, 255 of the
Annulment Application. On pages 156-181 of the Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants
quote paragraphs 176, 178, 187, 195, 198, 199, 203, 211, 215, 216, 223, 232, 236, 238,
243, 244, and 286 of the Resubmission Award as examples of systematic bias amounting

to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and manifest excess of power.
The Applicants summarise their complaint as follows:

En outre, la partialité du Tribunal de Resoumission est

The Respondent does not deny that injustice had been done during the military coup d’état
and the dictatorship.!°° To the contrary, it contends that it deployed great efforts to

compensate the people that “had been mistreated by the Military Government.” ©”

The Respondent summarises its position by confirming that:

Chile is not attempting to justify the expropriation, and is
still conscious of the injury that the expropriation caused. As
will be seen, however, this issue is entirely inapposite for the
Committee’s purposes.!%*

The Respondent contends that the reason for the Applicants’ failure to receive
compensation for the expropriation of El Clarin is twofold. On the one hand, they
“voluntarily, consciously, and formally renounced their right to obtain reparations under
Chilean law” by letter of 24 June 1999, by which they informed the Government that they
made use of the “fork-in-the-road” option and pursued their claim through international
arbitration.!°? On the other hand, the First Tribunal correctly “concluded that the
expropriation exceeded the temporal scope of the BIT’s substantive protections,”!!° that
the expropriation was completed in 1975, before the entry into force of the BIT, and that

compensation for expropriation could not be awarded under international law.!!!

The Respondent speculates about the Applicants’ motivation to pursue the dispute so

vigorously:

Now, these particular Claimants are not motivated by
rational economic considerations. They are motivated,
obviously, by the prospect of a big payoff, but they also see
inherent value in keeping this case alive, because by keeping
this case alive, they keep their ideological cause in the public
eye.

This case continues to be very high profile in Chile. And so
the longer this case goes on, the more of these hearings we
have, the more it stays in the public eye; and, therefore, this
case, in itself, just the actual act of continuing the case, has
inherent value to them. !!?

To the Committee’s mind, two interrelated aspects are crucial for the Applicants’ refusal
to accept a result that admits injustice and still denies monetary compensation, and for their
conviction that the result must be tainted by systematic bias and partiality. One concerns
the parallel but unsynchronised proceedings before national courts and international
arbitral tribunals as well as the application or non-application of national law and
international law. The other concerns the element of time, which is relevant under three
headings: first, the temporal application of the BIT, second, the statute of limitations, and
third, the length of Chilean court proceedings, amounting to — in the First Tribunal’s res
iudicata finding — a denial of justice and violation of the fair and equitable treatment

obligation.

The Committee will deal with these aspects before addressing the different claims and
requests for annulment one by one. It does so because their proper appreciation has
repercussions for several of these claims, in particular for the allegation of a continuous
manifest excess of power and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure as

operated through a systematic bias on the part of the Resubmission Tribunal.
(2) The First Award and its partial confirmation by the First Committee

Article 10.2 of the BIT tries to prevent parallel proceedings by providing:

"2 Tr, Day 2 (13 March 2019), p. 569.

Tf the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the time
it was initiated by one of the Parties, it shall be submitted, at
the discretion of the investor, to:

- The national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved
in the dispute; or

- International arbitration in the conditions described in
paragraph 3.

Once the investor has submitted the dispute to the
jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved or to
international arbitration, the choice of one or the other
procedure shall be final.

233. The First Tribunal found, with res iudicata effect that:

La requéte d’arbitrage et la demande introduite devant le
juge chilien ont donc un objet et un fondement distincts. La
premiére consiste a demander réparation du préjudice
découlant des actes de saisie et de confiscation relatifs aux
sociétés CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda sur le fondement de certaines
dispositions de l’API Chili-Espagne, tandis que la seconde
vise la restitution d’un bien meuble bien identifié, la rotative
Goss, et expressément exclu du champ du consentement a
Varbitrage, en se fondant sur le droit chilien.'°

234. In the end, the Applicants were not successful with their claim before national courts for
the restitution of the Goss printing machine, abandoned this effort for a remedy and

submitted their claim to the First Tribunal by complementing their initial request.!!4

235. Mr. Pey brought his claim before the Chilean courts on the basis of Chilean law, and the

Chilean courts applied Chilean law.!!5

236. Things are more complicated with respect to the law to be applied by arbitral tribunals.

Article 10.4 of the BIT provides:

The arbitration body shall take its decision on the basis of
the provisions of this Agreement, of the law of the
Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, including the
tules relative to conflicts of laws, and of the terms of any
specific agreements concluded in relation to investment, as
well as of the principles of international law on the subject.

The Parties hold contradictory views on the proper law to be applied to the issues of
Mr. Pey Casado’s ownership of the shares in the Chilean juridical persons, of his

nationality, and of his and the Foundation’s investments, and of the expropriation.

The present ad hoc Committee’s authority is limited to a review of the Resubmission
Award. However, the Resubmission Award can only be assessed properly by setting it in
the perspective of the First Award and the First Annulment Decision, which upheld

important parts of it.

The First Tribunal did not apply the provisions of the BIT and national Chilean law
cumulatively, incongruously and at random but rather differentiated its application in

accordance with specific subject matters and spheres of application.

After a meticulous analysis of Chilean law in paragraphs 179-229 of the First Award, the
First Tribunal established that Mr. Pey Casado had acquired shares of the Chilean
companies CPP S.A. and EPC Ltda, incorporated under Chilean law, and that this
acquisition was perfected before the expropriation was completed by Decree No. 165. It
further established, in paragraphs 230-235 of the First Award, that the acquisition was a
legal investment under Chilean law and thereby satisfied the criteria of an investment under
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Finally, it established that Mr. Pey Casado transferred
part of the legally acquired shares to the Foundation President Allende in accordance with
“le droit applicable a la cession (quel qu’il soit — espagnol, chilien ou autre)” but in any

event not international law.'!°

46 First Award, para. 528.

50

241. For the First Tribunal, these findings are of crucial importance and it reiterates them in

strategic contexts as follows in its Award:

Le Tribunal conclut que, au moment oii a été effectuée la
saisie du journal El Clarin, M. Pey Casado devait étre
considéré comme le seul propriétaire légitime les actions de
la société CPP S.A. (paragraph 229)

Au vu de l’ensemble des développements qui précédent, le
Tribunal conclut qu’il n’existait pas, dans le droit chilien en
vigueur en 1972, de définition établie de l'investissement
étranger et que l’opération réalisée par M. Pey Casado s’est
conformée au droit chilien qui lui était applicable. En
conséquence, le Tribunal considére que l'investissement de
M. Pey Casado, l’achat d’actions d’une société chilienne du
secteur de la presse au moyen de paiements en devises
étrangéres effectués sur des comptes bancaires en Europe,
satisfait les conditions posées par lAPI et plus
particuliérement par ses articles 1(2) et 2(2). (paragraph
411)

Sur la seconde question, celle de savoir si les investissements
des demanderesses ont bénéficié d’un traitement juste et
équitable, une réponse négative s’impose de l’avis du
Tribunal arbitral, compte tenu des conclusions auxquelles il
est parvenu précédemment aux termes de son appréciation
des preuves et de son analyse juridique. En bref, il s’agit de
la conclusion selon laquelle M. Pey Casado a bien démontré
avoir procédé a des investissements et étre propriétaire de
biens meubles ou immeubles qui ont été confisqués par
Vautorité militaire chilienne.

On rappellera a ce propos I’ existence d’un jugement chilien
reconnaissant la propriété de M. Pey Casado sur les actions
confisquées ainsi que le fait que les autorités chiliennes,
exécutives et administratives (comme judiciaires) étaient
informées des revendications et demandes formulées par les
demanderesses.

Quant a Vinvalidité des confiscations et au devoir
d’indemnisation, il y a lieu de rappeler aussi des
déclarations parfaitement claires de la défenderesse dans la
présente procédure. (paragraphs 665-667)

51

242.

243.

244.

The First Committee confirmed the First Tribunal’s findings. It stated that the “Tribunal
provided ample and indeed very detailed reasons to support its conclusions” and “that the
Tribunal applied the ‘proper law,’ i.e., Articles 1(2) and 2(2) of the BIT as well as the

Chilean law to which these provisions refer.” !!7

After having established the Claimants’ ownership and investment, the First Tribunal went
on to assess Chile’s conduct after the coup d’état. It describes the seizure of Mr. Pey
Casado’s assets by the Chilean military forces in 1973 and the adoption of a series of laws,
decrees and other normative acts, amongst which are Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975
and Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000. It describes the conduct and the regulatory texts as

ols

“faits pertinents, and it subsumes these facts under the provisions of the BIT and

international law.

The First Tribunal considered the validity of Decree No. 165 pursuant to Chilean law for
the specific purpose of determining whether the expropriation was a continuous or an
instantaneous act. The Applicants argued that since the Decree was inexistent under
Chilean law, they suffered a de facto expropriation which was continuous in nature, which
still continued after the entry into force of the BIT and therefore fell within its temporal
scope of application. The First Tribunal rejected this specific thesis of the inexistence (or
nullity ab initio) of the Decree on the basis of an analysis of Chilean law:

Le Tribunal reléve qu’un certain nombre de ces décrets a été

annulé par les juridictions internes chiliennes. [...] A la

connaissance du Tribunal, le décret supréme n°165 est
toujours en vigueur.

And again:

n’a pas été remise en cause par les juridictions internes et

245.

246.

ce décret fait toujours partie de l’ordre juridique interne
chilien.''°

As a consequence thereof, the First Tribunal was not interested in qualifying Chile’s acts
as wrongful and unlawful, because in any event, the expropriation was completed in 1975
and could therefore not qualify as a violation of Article 5 of the BIT, which defines, as
elements of a lawful expropriation, that they “must be adopted exclusively for reasons of
public utility or national interest pursuant to constitutional and legal provisions, and shall
in no case be discriminatory.” The Tribunal held that “[l]es biens des sociétés CPP S.A. et

commentary were discussed during the Hearing. '*+ Without referring to Article 14 or the
Commentary but in line with its contents, the First Tribunal discussed whether an
exceptional situation existed in the dispute before it. It confirmed that it did not agree that
a “violation continue” existed under the circumstances of the case and dismissed

exceptional circumstances. !75

247. The First Tribunal left no doubt about the “invalidité des confiscations et au devoir
d’indemnisation” and urged Chile to follow up to its own respective recognition of these

facts.!?° At the same time, it reiterated:

Quoi qu’il en soit de la pertinence et de la valeur des
éléments qui ont été retenus a cet égard en droit interne
chilien, ces éléments ne peuvent prévaloir sur les
considérations qui ont conduit le Tribunal arbitral aux
conclusions précédemment énoncées, en application des
dispositions de 'API.'"7

248. All of this is in line with the distinction between different issues where domestic law and
international law each has its own sphere of application, as described by Professor Zachary

Douglas:

Any dispute concerning the existence or extent of the rights
in rem alleged to constitute an investment that arises in an
investment treaty arbitration must be decided in accordance
with the municipal law of the host state for this is not a
dispute about evidence (facts) but a dispute about legal
entitlements. When the issue becomes the international
validity of certain acts of the host state which have
prejudiced the investor’s legal entitlements under municipal
law, then international law applies exclusively. !78

The First Committee confirmed the finality of the Tribunal’s assessment. !”? It rejected the
Claimants’ request to re-open the debate on the effect of the Chilean Constitution as time-

barred. °°

In conclusion, the First Tribunal, the First Committee, the Applicants and the Respondent
agreed that Mr. Pey Casado was expropriated in violation of Chilean law. Notwithstanding
this consensus, compensation for this illegal seizure has not been granted, as a result of the
combined effects of (i) the rejection of a claim for illegal expropriation under international
law by the First Tribunal because it fell outside the temporal scope of the BIT; (ii) the
rejection of the claim for the restitution of the Goss machine by a Chilean court because it
was time-barred; and (iii) Mr. Pey Casado’s decision to bring the claims before an ICSID
tribunal thus excluding national remedies in accordance with the “fork-in-the road”

provision of Article 10.2 of the BIT.

This result is a consequence of the interplay and application of national and international
law as well as of the passage of time. With respect to international law, the First Tribunal’s
finding was confirmed by the First Committee as final and is thus res indicata. The First
Committee confirmed the finality of the First Tribunal’s determination that the Applicants
had no entitlement to compensation for the illicit expropriation under international law

ratione temporis.

Neither the Resubmission Tribunal nor the present ad hoc Committee has the authority to
reverse the consequence, although the Committee understands that the Applicants perceive

this as an ongoing and unacceptable injustice perpetrated by a military dictatorship.

The First Tribunal also found that Chile had breached its obligation to treat the Claimants’
investment fairly and equitably, as provided in Article 4.1 BIT. The first such violation
consisted in the adoption of Decision No. 43, dated 28 April 2000, i.e. after the entry into

force of the BIT, “accordant des compensations — pour des raisons qui lui sont propres et

sont restées inexpliquées — a des personnages qui, de l’avis du Tribunal arbitral, n’étaient
pas propriétaires des biens confisqués.” >!
The second violation consisted in the delay of more than seven years (1995-2002) for
proceedings before the Chilean first instance court on the Claimants’ request for the
restitution of the Goss machine. After these seven years, the Applicants abandoned the
Chilean court proceedings and submitted the dispute over the Goss machine to the First
Tribunal, in complementing their original request. The Tribunal determined that the answer
to the “relatively simple question” of whether the period of seven years constituted a denial
of justice:

[N]e peut étre que positive, au regard des faits établis et déja

retenus par le Tribunal arbitral, l’absence de toute décision

par les tribunaux civils chiliens sur les prétentions de M. Pey

Casado s’analysant en un déni de justice. En effet, l’absence

de décision en premiere instance sur le fond des demandes

des parties demanderesses pendant sept années, c’est-a-dire

entre septembre 1995 et le 4 novembre 2002 (moment de

Vintroduction de la demande complémentaire dans la

présente procédure) doit étre qualifié comme un déni de

justice de la part des tribunaux chiliens. En fait, des délais

procéduraux importants constituent bien une des formes
classiques de déni de justice.'*?

The Applicants interpreted the First Tribunal’s finding on a denial of justice as opening the
way to the Resubmission Tribunal’s granting compensation based on the injury caused by
the expropriation. The issue has caused considerable debate. It is therefore appropriate to
quote the Applicants’ position in some detail. They insist that they “ne fondent leur

prétention sur une remise en cause du raisonnement du Tribunal arbitral initial ou des

parties de la Sentence qui ont autorité de chose jugée.”*> At the same time they invite the

Resubmission Tribunal to take the alleged deliberate retention into account:

[Dans la détermination du préjudice résultant du déni de
justice, qui doit remettre les parties dans la situation dans
laquelle elles auraient dii se trouver si le déni de justice
n’avait pas eu lieu. Rappelons en effet, qu’en l’absence de
déni de justice, le Tribunal arbitral initial n’aurait pas pu
conclure dans la Sentence que « a la connaissance du
Tribunal, la validité du Décret n°165 n’a pas été remise en
cause par les juridictions internes et ce décret fait toujours
partie de V’ordre juridique interne chilien.'**

And:

Le présent Tribunal arbitral devra dés lors constater que
l'un des actes de déni de justice commis par la République
du Chili a l’égard de M. Pey et de la Fondation a eu pour
effet d’empécher les Demanderesses d’informer le Tribunal
arbitral du jugement de la juridiction civile chilienne
reconnaissant la “ nullité de droit public” du Décret n°165,
et, en conséquence, l’absence de titre de I’ Etat défendeur sur
Vinvestissement en 1995, compte tenu de la nullité de droit
public du Décret n°? 165. Ce qui a conduit le Tribunal
arbitral a considérer que, “a sa connaissance”, ce Décret
n’avait pas été remis en cause par les juridictions internes
et faisait toujours partie de l’ordre juridique interne chilien,
et, par voie de conséquence, que les dispositions de l'article
5 de lV’API étaient inapplicables aux faits de confiscation.

Cette tromperie fondamentale démasquée, la Défenderesse
ne saurait bien évidemment pas se prévaloir de ses
maneeuvres procédurales subséquentes.'*>

256. The present ad hoc Committee does not share the Applicants’ analysis in this respect.

257. In fact, the First Tribunal took care to dissociate the issue of expropriation from the two

events that in its opinion amounted to a violation of Article 4.1 BIT. The dissociation was

crucial for the temporal applicability of the BIT with respect to the violations of fair and
equitable treatment. In that perspective, the First Tribunal determined that Decision No. 43
granting compensation for the expropriation of E/ Clarin to individuals who were not its
owners, was not an expropriatory act, since the expropriation was once and for all

“5?

completed. Rather, Decision No. 43 should “‘s’analyser davantage en une application
discriminatoire d’une loi postérieure au traité et des droits que celle-ci a créés. Il s’agit
d’une question distincte et non pas d’un fait identique a l’ expropriation.” °° The Tribunal
found that Mr. Pey Casado had become the owner of the shares and an investor. The
discrimination was not caused by Decree No. 165 nor any other act of seizure but by the
fact that Chile had decided to compensate “de[s] personnes non-propriétaires” to the
detriment and injury of the real owner.'?7 It has found that this discriminatory conduct had

to be considered as an unfair and unequitable treatment. !**

As to the long delay of the procedure before the Chilean courts, the First Tribunal found
that this delay amounted to a denial of justice and unfair and unequitable treatment, without

any reference to the subject matter, i.e. the seizure of the Goss machine.

The issue of the constitutionality and nullity of Decree No. 165 was irrelevant for the
adjudication by the First Tribunal of the violation of Chile’s obligation to guarantee fair

and equitable treatment.

The First Committee confirmed the violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard
and insisted that the First Tribunal had correctly determined that both the execution of
Decision No. 43 and the denial of justice “were completely separate and distinct from the
1975 expropriation.”'? The First Committee explicitly stated that “the duty to provide
redress for violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end, as

long as the relevant treaty obligation was in force for the State concerned at the time of the

262.

alleged breach.” !#° The First Committee thus dismissed Chile’s assertion that subsequent
to the expropriation, there was no investment left to which the fair and equitable treatment
standard could apply. At the same time, these reasons made it clear that the finding of a
breach of fair and equitable treatment was not dependent on the qualification of the

expropriation as a continuous fact.

The First Committee confirmed the finality of the First Tribunal’s determination that Chile
owes compensation for the violation of its obligation to guarantee fair and equitable

treatment, insofar as it occurred after the entry into force of the BIT.

The First Award’s res iudicata effect also prevented the Resubmission Tribunal from
taking into account the Applicants’ argument that absent the denial of justice, the First
Tribunal could have taken account of the judgment of the Santiago court to the alleged
effect that Decree No. 165 was null ab initio so that the expropriation was a continuous
fact. Having found that the expropriation was not within the temporal scope of application
of the BIT, the First Tribunal reasoned that as a logical consequence thereof, arguments
and evidence concerning the expropriation could not be used to establish a prejudice
resulting from the denial of fair and equitable treatment. This statement was made in
Chapter VIII, paragraph 688 of the First Award. As further discussed in paragraphs 620 ss.
below, the First Committee quoted this paragraph affirmatively and confirmed in paragraph
283 of its Decision that “the Tribunal expressly stated that an evaluation of the damages
allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the expropriation was irrelevant and that
all the allegations, discussion and evidence related to such damages could not be
considered by the Tribunal.” The First Committee thereby made the content of paragraph
688 of the First Award its own, with the consequence that it was res iudicata for the

Resubmission Tribunal.

‘40 First Annulment Decision, para. 168 (footnotes omitted).

59

(3) The Resubmission Tribunal’s general appreciation of the res iudicata effect

263. The Resubmission Tribunal defined its role as being limited to determining “the nature of

the compensation due for the breach or breaches already established by the First Tribunal”

and insisted:

[T]hat the present Tribunal is absolved from any need to
investigate afresh whether there was any breach of Chile’s
obligations towards the Claimants in respect of the present
dispute, what that breach consisted in, or whether the breach
gives rise to a right to compensation. All of those matters
have been predetermined by the First Award and are binding
on all Parties under Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention.
Not only is there no need for the Tribunal to go into these
matters, but it would be a manifest excess of its own
jurisdiction if the Tribunal purported to do so. That is the
express consequence of Arbitration Rule 55(3).'4!

264. It held, however, that the duty to refrain from re-determining the non-annulled portions of

the First Award did not:

[P]revent the present Tribunal from proceeding to an
interpretation of the First Award for the purposes of carrying
out its mandate under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID
Arbitration Rules. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise; the
essence of the Tribunal’s mandate consists in giving effect,
in the light of the arguments marshalled by the Parties, to
certain paragraphs in the dispositif of the First Award, and
this the Tribunal can hardly do without first understanding
what those paragraphs mean. '47

265. In that perspective, the Resubmission Tribunal recalls that the First Tribunal had rejected

141

142

claims linked to the expropriation in 1973-1975 because the temporal scope of the BIT did
not cover that period and that only the breach of the Respondent’s obligation to accord fair
and equitable treatment, including not to deny justice, which was linked to Chile’s Decision

No. 43 of the year 2000 to compensate non-owners instead of Mr. Pey Casado and to the

Resubmission Award, para. 178.
Resubmission Award, para. 207.

60

long delay of Chilean court proceedings starting in 1995, was a valid basis for
compensation. The Resubmission Tribunal reasons that the Claimants try to circumvent

this “insuperable obstacle” by a “complex” answer which it describes as follows:

In certain places, the Claimants contend that elements of the
non-annulled parts of the First Award need to be revisited
and modified by the present Tribunal. That would however
(as already indicated) be well beyond the Tribunal’s
functions and powers under ICSID Arbitration Rule 55 and
will not be further considered in this Award. The main
substance of the Claimants’ answer is, however, different. It
consists essentially in the contention that the central
consequence of the denial of justice found by the First
Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the proceedings
before the Santiago court over the Goss press, was that they
(the Claimants) were disabled from invoking a conclusive
argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely null (ex tunc)
and as such incapable of producing any legal effects. Had
they been in a position to do so, the argument continues, they
(the Claimants) would either have been able to recover their
confiscated property in Chile, or at the least would have been
able to establish before the First Tribunal that the
expropriation of this property was not an instantaneous act
taking final effect in 1975, but was not in fact completed
until many years later, and the result of that would have been
that the expropriation did indeed fall under the jurisdiction
of the First Tribunal under the BIT, contrary to the findings
in the First Award. '3

266. The Resubmission Tribunal continues its reasoning through “‘a brief excursus on the status
of Decree No. 165 under Chilean public law” and justifies this excursus as “convenient”
since the issue has “absorbed an appreciable portion of the argument between the Parties,
both in the written phase and at the oral hearing.” It weighs the Respondent’s expert’s
reasoning and finds merit in the opinion that the nullity ab initio of a normative act should
be pronounced explicitly and that the Claimants’ assertions are more “of the speculative

than of the operational.” !##

43 Resubmission Award, para. 196.
4 Resubmission Award, para. 197.

61

267. The Resubmission Tribunal then considers that it “sees no need to go further into the matter
as it has concluded that, even if the Claimants were able to establish the proposition for
which they have been arguing, it would have no material bearing on these resubmission
proceedings.” '4> This is due to the possible consequences with respect to remedies which

might result from the status of Decree No. 165:

As the Tribunal sees it, there are only two: one is that the
First Tribunal was wrong in its finding that the expropriation
was excluded ratione temporis from the scope of the BIT;
the other is that what amounted in effect (if not in form) to
the expropriation took place with Decision No. 43. Each of
these has figured, in various forms, in the submissions of the
Claimants in the course of these resubmission proceedings.
Both of them, however, encounter insuperable difficulties.
As to the first, the Tribunal is in no doubt that the First
Tribunal, although it used slightly different forms of words
in different parts of its Award, was of the view that the
expropriation was completed (fait consommé) with the
physical seizure in 1975 and thus fell outside the scope of
the BIT. More to the point, however, the present Tribunal is
simply not empowered to hear an appeal against that finding,
or to substitute a view of its own for that of the First
Tribunal, or to award any relief of any kind whatsoever on
that account. As to the second (i.e. that the effective
expropriation did not take place until Decision No. 43), it is
also in its turn incompatible with the First Tribunal’s
findings as to the chronology of the expropriation, but it is
equally incompatible with Decision No. 43 itself, the whole
tenor of which is that it was an award of compensation in
respect of a confiscation that had already occurred. The
Tribunal’s final observation before leaving the subject, is
that, if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decree No.
165 did indeed have decisive significance, the consequence
would surely be that the investment continued to be, in law,
the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation — the
remedy for which could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly
not before this Tribunal in these resubmission
proceedings. 46

270.

In other words, the Resubmission Tribunal reasoned that a finding that Decree No. 165 was
null ex tunc would serve no useful purpose in the Resubmission Proceeding, since the
Resubmission Tribunal was bound by the First Tribunal’s res iudicata finding that the

expropriation was an instantaneous act occurring at the time of that decree.

In addition, the Resubmission Tribunal found that it was also bound by the res iudicata
finding in the First Award that the compensation for the violation of the fair and equitable
treatment standard could not be based on the value of the expropriated assets. Paragraph
230(d) of the Resubmission Award thus provides that “any assessment of injury and
damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent with the First Award and must

therefore be rejected.”'#” This is discussed in more detail in paragraphs 661-672 below.
(4) The Parties’ positions before this Committee

The anti-constitutionality, the illegality and the absolute nullity ex tunc of Decree No. 165
remain central elements in the Applicants’ claim, “Ja question la plus essentielle des
échanges dans le cadre de la procédure en resoumission.” #8 They assert that this has been
definitely established by the Chilean courts and is res iudicata between the Parties. As a
consequence, the Applicants have never lost their status as legal owners and the
confiscation in 1973 and 1975 was restricted to a purely physical seizure, to a de facto but

not to a de iure confiscation:'”

The Applicants further assert that they did not ask the Resubmission Tribunal to correct
the First Tribunal’s determination on the temporal scope of the BIT and the exclusion of a
claim for compensation for the expropriation “d’un iota.”'>! They have not found an error
in the First Tribunal’s reasoning with respect to Decree No. 165 at the time of the Award
because at that time, the Tribunal “avait estimé devoir s’aligner sur Vhypothése de sa

validité en droit interne.”'>*

Rather, they consider first that the First Tribunal granted a claim for compensation under
Article 4 BIT and not under Article 5 because it had found that Chile had acted unfairly
and unequitably in compensating non-owners instead of Mr. Pey Casado after the
confiscation and its uncontested illegality, and second that the denial of justice had
prevented the Applicants from proving the continuous character of the expropriation. '** To
this end, they quote in their Memorial on Annulment from their Resubmission Reply of

9 January 2015:

En effet, le déni de justice a consisté en ce que les
Demanderesses ont été privées de la preuve des rapports de
droits de leur investissement avec Il’Etat du Chili.

place du Tribunal arbitral initial, puisque cette partie de la
décision a été annulée.'*4

The Applicants assert that the Resubmission Tribunal:

- manipulated and denaturalized the Claimants’ submissions with respect to the First
Tribunal’s arguments and findings in order to accommodate the Respondent’s wishes,

which amounts to a lack of impartiality and bias and represents a serious departure from

presenting a reasoning “concernant l’application du droit applicable sur la question la

donc limitée a une « bréve digression », pourrait-on dire une remarque en passant !,
ce qui en soit est contradictoire”’, and second by presenting a reasoning on the
Claimants’ submissions with respect to Decree No. 165 and Decision No. 43 that the

Claimants have never made, these contradictions amounting to a lack of reasons; 157 and

systematically disrespected the unannulled portions of the First Award, in flagrant
contradiction of ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3), and thereby usurped an authority that it

does not have and manifestly exceeded its powers. !**

The Applicants submit that Subchapter IILE. (“The Status of Decree No. 165”) of the
Resubmission Award, and in particular its paragraph 198, crystallises the Resubmission
Tribunal’s erroneous and annullable reasoning by denying the injustice perpetrated by the
military dictatorship and by preventing a just compensation for the illegal confiscation of
the Claimants’ investments, caused by unfair treatment and denial of justice. Since
paragraph 198 “constitue le point d’ancrage des paragraphes suivants de la SR,”'*? the
Applicants request that the Committee not only to annul paragraph 198 but also “les

consequence, les points 2-7 du Dispositif dont ils constituent le fondement et l’ensemble de

The Respondent refutes the Applicants’ arguments and request. It asserts that the First

Tribunal determined, with res iudicata effect, that the expropriation was completed in

1975, i.e. before the entry into force of the BIT and that “none of the BIT’s substantive

provisions applied to the expropriation of El Clarin.”'®! The Respondent summarises that:

The Respondent asserts that the “Claimants’ arguments did not persuade the Resubmission

Tribunal”

[T]he Resubmission Tribunal concluded that the Chilean law
issues under discussion were irrelevant simply because what
[sic] Claimants’ theory about the implications of Chilean law
necessarily contradicted the conclusions in the First Award.
The Resubmission Tribunal therefore could not have
accepted such arguments without doing violence to the First
Award, which had clearly held that “the expropriation [of El
Clarin] was completed (fait consommé) with the physical
seizure in 1975 [sic] and thus fell outside the scope of the
BIT.” Given that conclusion, Claimants’ theories about
Decree No. 165 were irrelevant, since the issue of whether
or not the expropriation was a continuing one or not - for
purposes of the BIT and of international law - did not depend
on the legal status of Decree No. 165 under Chilean law. [...]
Accordingly, there was no need for the Resubmission
Tribunal to take any decision or make any pronouncement
on the Chilean law issues that had been raised by Claimants.
The tribunal’s handling of the applicable law issues was
therefore unimpeachable. '

(5) The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee will address the asserted grounds for annulment in the subsequent sections
of this Decision. In the context of these initial considerations, it will analyse the
Resubmission Tribunal’s reasoning and findings with a view to determining whether it was
systematically biased in favour of Chile as alleged by the Applicants. Two indicators in
that sense would be a denaturalization of the Applicants’ submissions and a disrespect of
the First Tribunal’s adjudication in order to accommodate Chile’s interests, thereby
disregarding the injustice perpetrated by the military dictatorship through the violent
seizure of the Applicants’ investments and the ensuing adoption of an illegal, anti-
constitutional and absolutely invalid sham normative act, Decree No. 165, again as alleged

by the Applicants.

In that perspective, the Committee has juxtaposed and compared the arguments and
findings of the First Tribunal as far as they were confirmed as final by the First Committee,
the Resubmission Tribunal, and the Parties in relation to the qualification and relevance of
Decree No. 165. After a careful analysis, it has found that the Resubmission Tribunal has
not denaturalized the Applicants’ submissions and has not reconsidered the non-annulled
portions of the First Award. As a consequence, it cannot confirm that the Resubmission
Tribunal acted in a partial and biased manner and favoured Chile by an inappropriate
reasoning with respect to this issue. The Committee will document this determination in

the following paragraphs.

Paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award, which the Applicants present as the “anchor”
of the Tribunal’s decision on the qualification of the confiscation, starts by stating that the
qualification of Decree No. 165 has no “material bearing” on the proceeding. In this light,
it is unclear why the Resubmission Tribunal has embarked on a long discussion on that
qualification in the preceding paragraph 197. Perhaps it wanted to pay tribute to the fact
that the Parties, and in particular the Applicants, had taken the issue very seriously, that it
had been a dominant feature during the initial phase, the first annulment phase and the
resubmission phase of the proceeding, and that the First Tribunal had not treated the matter
in as much detail as it could have done.

Be that as it may, the Resubmission Tribunal’s statement does not distort the First
Tribunal’s res iudicata findings on the content and relevance of Decree No. 165. It remains
an obiter dictum. Obiter dicta are not grounds for annulment since they are without
relevance for the decision and are not outcome-determinative. The decisive finding of the
Resubmission Tribunal is the first sentence of paragraph 198 according to which none of

the controversial propositions by the Parties has a “material bearing.”

This determination dovetails the First Tribunal’s finding and thus respects the res iudicata
effect of the First Award. It had decided that the expropriation had been completed

irrespective of its illegality. The Resubmission Tribunal accepts this result as res iudicata.

 

It had no authority to re-open this

  

issue. The Applicants’ reproach that it has failed to apply
the Chilean Constitution therefore has no legal merit. This is not a matter of whether the
Constitution was part of the applicable law before the Resubmission Tribunal. The point is
that the First Tribunal’s res iudicata finding that the expropriation was an instantaneous
act occurring at the date of Decree No. 165, together with its reasoning that “[&] la
connaissance du Tribunal, la validité du Décret n°165 n’a pas été remise en cause par les
juridictions internes et ce décret fait toujours partie de l’ordre juridique interne chilien,”'*
barred the Resubmission Tribunal from applying the Chilean Constitution so as to reach
the opposite conclusion that the decree was not part of the Chilean legal order so that the

expropriation was a continuous act.

Whatever criticism the First Tribunal’s reasoning may attract, it could not be directed
against the Resubmission Award. It would be concerned with the First Tribunal’s finding,

as confirmed as final by the First Committee.

The Applicants submit that the First Tribunal did not have knowledge about the nullity of
Decree No. 165 and therefore decided to “‘s’aligner sur V’hypothése de sa validité en droit

interne.” © Instead of criticizing the First Tribunal for having made a wrong decision, the

166 Claimants’ Resubmi

Applicants asked the Resubmission Tribunal to decide anew, “en connaissance de cause
au lieu et place du Tribunal arbitral initial,”'® taking account also of the Chilean court
decision of July 2008 which, as a consequence of the denial of justice, was rendered too

late for the First Tribunal to consider.

However, notwithstanding the Applicants’ assertion, the Chilean court decision of July
2008 did not acknowledge the absolute nullity of Decree No. 165. As already mentioned,
the decision decided the opposite. Mr. Pey argued before the court that Decree No. 165
was “entaché de nullité de droit public, imprescriptible [et] incurable, qui provoque son
inexistence juridique.” '®' This was disputed by the State which asserted that the decree had
been enacted in accordance with constitutional provisions applicable at the time, with the
consequence that Mr. Pey’s request was time-barred. '°® The Court dismissed Mr. Pey’s
argument, reasoning that his claim was time-barred by calculating the relevant periods of
time as from the enactment of the decree. '®° The Chilean court’s decision therefore appears
to be to the effect that Decree No. 165 did exist in the Chilean legal order. One does not
see how it would have changed the First Tribunal’s determination that the decree was still

part of the Chilean legal order. !7°

In sum, therefore, by aligning itself on the First Tribunal’s res iudicata assessment, the
Resubmission Tribunal complied with its obligation pursuant to Articles 52 and 53 of the
ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) to recognize the non-annulled parts
of the First Award as final. In doing so, it did not exceed its power nor did it express bias

against the Applicants.

The second sentence in paragraph 198 summarises the Applicants’ argument that Decree

No. 165 was illegal, that the physical seizure was not a legally effective expropriation and

that, therefore, the Applicants were still the legal owners of the shares and the assets. This
cannot be a distortion of the Applicants’ argument, since they state unequivocally that they
“continuent aujourd hui a étre les propriétaires légaux de tous les biens et droit du Groupe

Clarin.”'™

The Applicants further assert that the Resubmission Tribunal implies, in the third and
fourth sentence of paragraph 198, that the Applicants brought arguments which in fact
they never brought, namely that “the First Tribunal was wrong in its finding that the
expropriation was excluded ratione temporis from the scope of the BIT” and “that what

amounted in effect (if not in form) to the expropriation took place with Decision No. 43.”!7

As concerns the first limb of this argument, the Applicants had asked the Resubmission
Tribunal to decide that Decree No. 165 was null and void ab initio, “en connaissance de
cause au lieu et place du Tribunal arbitral initial.”'” This was an invitation to correct the
First Tribunal’s finding. Even if the Applicants exonerate the First Tribunal from having
committed an error by insisting that they did not know better, they nevertheless argue that
it appeared — ex post — “wrong” to regard Decree No. 165 as valid, and, as an alleged
consequence, that the expropriation was completed. The Committee therefore does not find
any evidence of bias against the Applicants in the Resubmission Tribunal’s assumption
that the Applicants believed that the First Tribunal “was wrong in its finding” and that their
request in effect, albeit indirectly, amounted to requesting the Resubmission Tribunal to

overturn res iudicata findings of the First Award.

Along the same lines, the Resubmission Tribunal did not distort the Applicants’ request
and argument that it should grant compensation for the violation of fair and equitable
treatment based on the value of the expropriated assets because the denial of justice had

prevented the Chilean court decision being available in time for the First Tribunal to

consider. This request was adequately summarised by the Resubmission Tribunal at

paragraph 196 of the Resubmission Award:

[T]he central consequence of the denial of justice found by
the First Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the
proceedings before the Santiago court over the Goss press,
was that they (the Claimants) were disabled from invoking a
conclusive argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely
null (ex func) and as such incapable of producing any legal
effects. Had they been in a position to do so, the argument
continues, they (the Claimants) would either have been able
to recover their confiscated property in Chile, or at the least
would have been able to establish before the First
Tribunal that the expropriation of this property was not
an instantaneous act taking final effect in 1975, but was
not in fact completed until many years later, and the
result of that would have been that the expropriation did
indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the First Tribunal
under the BIT, contrary to the findings in the First Award.
From this it follows, so the Claimants’ argument concludes,
that the loss suffered by them arising out of the denial of
justice is the loss of that right to compensation in the original
arbitration, so that such loss is the one they can now claim in
the present proceedings.'7*

The Resubmission Tribunal then — implicitly but certainly — rejected this thesis at
paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award, where it reasoned that the Applicants’ position
was incompatible with the First Tribunal’s finding that the expropriation had been
completed with the physical taking in 1975, as well as with Decision No. 43 which
purported to grant compensation for an expropriation that had already occurred.!7>
Accordingly, the Resubmission Tribunal did not distort the Applicants’ position and
neither does its handling of the request and argument evidence any bias to the detriment of

the Applicants.

The second limb of the Applicants’ argument as to the Resubmission Tribunal’s alleged

bias evidenced by the fourth sentence of paragraph 198 concerns the Resubmission

"74 Resubmission Award, para. 196 (emphasis added).

"5 Resubmission Award, para. 198.

293.

Tribunal’s incriminated assumption on the Applicants’ conclusion on Decision No. 43. The
Applicants criticise the Resubmission Tribunal for assuming that they regarded Decision
No. 43 as the expropriatory act, so as to oppose it to them. However, in considering, as it
does, the various “conclusions the Claimants would seek to draw [...] so far as the remedies
available in the present proceedings are concerned,” and in observing that “[a]s the
Tribunal sees it, there are only two,” the Resubmission Tribunal does not seek to attribute
to the Applicants a thesis which was not theirs, but considers all possible ways to make
concrete the Applicants’ position in a manner that might possibly warrant the granting of

compensation. There is no evidence of bias in these reasons.

As concerns the fifth sentence of paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award, the
Applicants had argued during the resubmission phase that the First Tribunal had considered
Decree No. 165 “faisait toujours partie de l’ordre juridique interne chilien, et, par voie de
conséquence, que les dispositions de l'article 5 de l’API étaient inapplicables aux faits de
confiscation.” '”° This assertion justifies the Resubmission Tribunal’s statement in the fifth
sentence of paragraph 198 that the arguments with respect to the continuous character of
the expropriation and the effect of Decision No. 43 “figured, in various forms, in the
submissions of the Claimants in the course of these submission proceedings.” The

Committee does not find any basis for annulment in this statement.

The sixth sentence of paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award prepares the following
sentences and mentions “insuperable difficulties” of the Applicants’ proposals, as assessed
by the Resubmission Tribunal. In sentences seven and eight, the Resubmission Tribunal
summarises the First Tribunal’s determination correctly that the expropriation was
completed in 1975 and states that it has no authority to “hear an appeal against that
finding.” The Committee does not find any basis for annulment in these statements. With
respect to Decision No. 43, the Resubmission Tribunal reiterates that the Claimants’

conclusions do not correspond to the First Tribunal’s chronology and are in themselves

176 Resubmission Memorial of 27 June 2014, para. 286 (C-8) (footnotes omitted).

296.

based on the completed act of expropriation. Again, these statements do not distort the First

Tribunal’s findings.

In the last sentence of paragraph 198, the Resubmission Tribunal makes an observation on
the alleged nullity of Decree No. 165 under Chilean law.'”’ The Resubmission Tribunal
believes that “if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decree No. 165 did indeed have
decisive significance, the consequence would surely be that the investment continued to
be, in law, the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation — the remedy for which
could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this Tribunal in these resubmission

proceedings.”

The Applicants allege that “la conséquence de ces contradictions étant de submerger les
Demanderesses dans le déni de justice le plus absolu consistant en ce que la 2éme Sentence
décline (§216) en faveur de ‘la sphére domestique’ la compétence pour porter reméde au
déni par VEtat Chilien, depuis le 24 mai 1995, des droits des Demanderesses sur leur

investissement que la Sentence initiale a déclaré sous la protection de VAPI.”'*

The Committee does not share the Applicants’ analysis. The Resubmission Tribunal does
not renounce exercising the powers it otherwise has in favour of the domestic sphere. In
the preceding sentences of paragraph 198, and in the last sentence itself, the Resubmission
Tribunal makes it explicit that, for reasons totally unrelated to any recourse the Applicants
may or may not have in the domestic sphere, the Resubmission Tribunal cannot, in
accordance with the applicable international law, grant the Applicants the reparation
requested. Accordingly, while the Resubmission Tribunal may have been wrong in
suggesting that “the remedy [...] could lie in the domestic sphere,” this did not constitute

a denial of justice, nor did it evidence any bias to the detriment of the Applicants.

177 Initially, the Resubmission Tribunal had referred to Decision No. 43 instead of Decree No. 165. It has rectified this
to his mind “purely clerical” error in paragraph 52 of its Decision on Rectification, in accordance with the Claimants’

Request for Rectification of 27 October 2016. The Committee uses the rectified version of the Resubm

 

ion Award

and does not discuss the Claimants’ arguments as far as they are based on the non-corrected version, as in
paragraph 233 of the Annulment Application and paragraphs 76 ss. of the Reply on Annulment.

"78 Annulment Application, para. 237.

300.

In fact, the Resubmission Award echoes the First Award. When discussing the
compensation granted by Decision No. 43 to the non-owners instead of Mr. Pey Casado
whom the First Tribunal had identified as the real owner and investor, the First Award
distinguishes clearly between the spheres of domestic law and international law. It states:
“[qluoi qu’il en soit de la pertinence et de la valeur des éléments qui ont été retenus a cet
égard en droit interne chilien, ces éléments ne peuvent prévaloir sur les considérations qui
ont conduit le Tribunal arbitral aux conclusions précédemment énoncées, en application

des dispositions de VAPI.”'”

The First Tribunal had concluded that the Applicants were entitled to compensation for the
consequences of the violation of Chile’s obligation to treat the Claimants fairly and
equitably in adopting Decision No. 43 in 2000 but not to compensation for the
internationally wrongful act of illegal expropriation. The latter was precluded in
international law ratione temporis but not necessarily in national law. This is the reason
why both tribunals have urged Chile to compensate the Claimants and to “rétablir la
légalité et réparer les dommages causés par le régime militaire,” in light of the “invalidité
des confiscations.”'®° The First Tribunal does not doubt the illegality of the expropriation
under Chilean law and the entitlement to compensation under Chilean law but sees no
possibility to repair the damages under international law, given the inapplicability “ratione

temporis des obligations de fonds contenues dans l’API.”'*!

This is what the Resubmission Tribunal expresses in the last sentence of paragraph 198 of
its Resubmission Award. It does not violate the res iudicata effect of the First Award but
to the contrary, it abides by it. The Committee does not find partiality in a determination

that respects this effect.

In sum, the Applicants’ perception of injustice indeed results from the fact that a violent

confiscation by a military regime, which is wrongful, illegal and anti-constitutional under

national law, is not sanctioned by an international arbitral tribunal. However, to the
Committee’s mind, this result is not attributable to the Resubmission Tribunal but to the
res iudicata adjudication of the First Tribunal on the applicability of the law of
expropriation under international law, which itself echoed the difficulties inherent in

bringing a claim on the basis of a BIT for facts originating before the BIT’s entry into force.

THE APPOINTMENT OF MR. ALEXIS MOURRE AND THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S

APPROACH TO THE APPLICANTS’ REQUESTS FOR HIS REMOVAL
dd) The Applicants’ Position

The Applicants asserted three grounds for annulment relating to Mr. Mourre’s appointment
by Chile, and the Resubmission Tribunal’s failure to take action on his removal from the

Tribunal:

(a) That the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a));
(b) That the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); and
(c) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure

(Article 52(1)(d)).

In their Reply on Annulment, the Applicants withdrew their assertion that the Tribunal

failed in this respect to state the reasons on which its award is based.'**
With respect to the improper constitution of the Tribunal, the Applicants submit as follows.

During the first arbitration Chile forfeited its right to appoint one of the arbitrators when
the arbitrator it had appointed resigned without the consent of the Tribunal. The resignation
triggered the application of Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention which provides that in
such circumstances the “Chairman [of the Administrative Council] shall appoint a person

from the appropriate Panel to fill the resulting vacancy.”

Reply on Annulment, para. 260.

75

304.

305.

306.

307.

183

The objective of Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention is, according to an explicatory note
of the ICSID Secretariat “to lessen the possibility of a party inducing an arbitrator
appointed by it to resign, so as either to enable his replacement by a more tractable person
or merely to delay the proceeding.” '**

The objective justifies the exception of the normal principle, according to which vacancies
are to be filled in the same way as the original appointments. It reflects, in the words of
A. Broches, “the suspicion that the party [that made the original appointment] may not be

a stranger to the resignation.” It serves “not only the principles of non-frustration and

expediency but also the principle of the immutability.”!**

In the present case, the Applicants argue, the general suspicion has materialized through
Chile’s conduct before the First Tribunal. Chile had to admit before the ICSID Secretariat

that its party appointed arbitrator )— in the words of the First Award:

[A]vait cru pouvoir communiquer [le projet de décision
partielle proposé par le Président] a@ la partie qui l’avait
désigné, au mépris de l’obligation, incontestée, de la
confidentialité des documents de travail du Tribunal et du
secret des délibérations. L’ existence de cette violation n’est
pas contestée, mais au contraire reconnue par défenderesse.
Le doute subsiste seulement sur la question de savoir qui en
a pris Vinitiative mais il n’incombe pas au présent Tribunal
arbitral de se prononcer a ce sujet, malgré les protestations
et demandes présentées au CIRDI par les demanderesses.'*°

Chile’s conduct was qualified by the First Tribunal as “incidents parfois incompatibles

avec les usages de V’arbitrage international.”

As quoted in Annulment Application, para. 63.

'S4 Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention - A Commentary (24 ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, Article
56, paras. 35, 37 (where Mr. Broches is cited) (CL-387). The Applicants rely on these texts in the Annulment

These findings were confirmed by the First Committee. They are res iudicata.'*”

Therefore, the Applicants argue, Chile has lost its right to appoint an arbitrator for the
totality of the proceeding, encompassing the Resubmission Proceeding, '** which are but
“a continuation of the original arbitration” as explicitly recognised in the Resubmission
Award.'®° Instead, the right and duty to appoint the arbitrator which under normal
circumstances would have been to be appointed by Chile, had from the moment of

resignation been transferred to the Chairman of the Administrative Council.

This is also in line with ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) according to which the Secretary-
General shall, upon receipt of an annulment request, invite the parties to proceed to
constitute a new Tribunal, including the same number of arbitrators, and “appointed by the
same method, as the original one.” Articles 50(2) and 51(3) of the ICSID Convention and
ICSID Arbitration Rules 51(3) and 55(2)(d) use the terms “tribunal initial,” “tribunal ayant

statué,” “original tribunal” and “tribunal which rendered the award” interchangeably. The
reference in ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) to the “original” Tribunal must therefore be

interpreted as a reference to the Tribunal which rendered the award.'°°

The decisions leading to Mr. Mourre’s appointment and continued membership of the
Resubmission Tribunal happened against systematic objections by the Applicants against

every single step and decision of the Centre, the Tribunal and Mr. Mourre.!°!
In sum, the Applicants assert that:

[L]e Centre et, par extension, le Tribunal, auraient dit
prendre en compte, au moment de la constitution du tribunal
de resoumission, le fait que la Défenderesse avait perdu le
droit de nommer un arbitre suite a la démission de

réprobation du Tribunal initial. Le fait d'avoir autorisé la
Défenderesse a procéder a la nomination d'un arbitre en la
personne de M. Mourre affecte la constitution du TR d’un
vice au sens de l'article 52(1)(a) de la Convention. '*

With respect to the manifest excess of power, the Applicants submit as follows.

First, the Resubmission Tribunal has violated ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) which provides

that the “new Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled.”

During the first arbitration, the Tribunal had determined that the Respondent’s appointed
arbitrator had acted improperly and had resigned without consent of the other arbitrators,
that Chile had provoked incidents that were contrary to good international arbitration
practice, and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council had filled the resulting

vacancy by appointing Professor Gaillard. All these findings are res iudicata.

The Applicants argue that the Resubmission Tribunal disrespected these res iudicata

effects of the First Award and decided anew, thus arrogating a power that it does not have:

Or l’arbitre ayant rempli la place du Professeur Emmanuel
Gaillard, M. Alexis Mourre, a été nommé par VEtat
Défendeur en enfreignant l’autorité de la chose jugée de la
Sentence du 8 mai 2008 , notamment celle des §§34, 35, 36,
37, 729 en rapport avec les paras. 5 a 7 du Dispositif, la
décision du 25 avril 2006 du Tribunal arbitral initial et le
§359(4) de la Décision du 18 décembre 2012 du Comité ad
hoe, obligatoires pour les parties.'°>

Second, the Applicants requested that the Tribunal address the question of improper
appointment of Mr. Mourre when Procedural Order No. 1 was discussed. Instead of

responding to this question in accordance with the authority bestowed upon it by Articles

41(1) and 44 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal had simply rejected the request:

321.

At the first session, the Claimants, while indicating that they
were not proposing the disqualification of the arbitrator
nominated by the Respondent, nevertheless requested the
Tribunal to decide whether the arbitrator in question had
been duly appointed in accordance with the Convention and
Arbitration Rules, and, if not, that the Tribunal invite him to
resign; whereas the Respondent maintained that the
arbitrator in question had been properly appointed in
accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention. In the
absence of a proposal for disqualification under the
Convention and Rules, the Tribunal does not feel called upon
to rule on the matter. !°4

The Applicants submit that since a refusal to exercise authority which in fact exists
constitutes as much an excess of powers as the exercise of authority which does not exist,
the decision of the Tribunal “de ne pas trancher par la voie de l'article 44 de la Convention
la question relative a la nomination irréguliére de l’un des arbitres, [...] constitue un tel

exces de pouvoir manifeste.”'

With respect to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants

 

 

submit as follows.

The Resubmission Tribunal rejected the Applicants’ request to take action on the
irregularity of Mr. Mourre’s appointment stating that it was for the Applicants to initiate
such action by a request for disqualification in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID
Convention. Article 57 provides that the disqualification can be proposed on account of
facts indicating “a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14,”
or when the arbitrator “was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of

Chapter IV.”

However, the Applicants consistently argued that their refusal to accept the appointment
of Mr. Mourre was in no way based on any of his personal qualities but on the fact that he

was appointed by a party that had forfeited its right to appointment. Therefore, “en

It seems that the Applicants extend their assertion of a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure to the Centre, when they submit that they “voient dans cette
décision [to incite the Applicants to have recourse to Article 57] du Centre et du Tribunal

Vobservation grave d’une régle de procedure fondamentale.” |!”

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent refutes the Claimants’ request and assertions and contends that none of

the grounds evoked for annulment with respect to the appointment of Mr. Mourre exists.

With respect to the improper constitution of the Tribunal, the Respondent submits _as

follows.

Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention “identifies a closed list of Convention provisions
that govern the process of constituting a resubmission tribunal,” meaning that other Articles
such as Article 56(3) are not applicable.'°* Even if the Resubmission Proceeding is the
continuation of the original arbitration, the Resubmission Tribunal is not a continuation of
the tribunal in the original arbitration. It is, as explicitly stated in Article 52(6) of the ICSID
Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d), a new tribunal. This new tribunal must
be constituted in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention. The
unambiguous language of all provisions and their purpose leave no doubt that there is no
place for the application of any further norm such as Article 56(3) of the ICSID

Convention, be it “by analogy or otherwise.” !?

In any event, Article 56(3) cannot apply to the constitution of a tribunal because it relates
to a situation that has occurred after such constitution, i.e. to the resignation of an arbitrator
and a “resulting” vacancy and not the situation at the outset of the constitution of the
tribunal. In addition, its plain language restricts the application to one single appointment
and the replacement of one particular arbitrator. The Applicants’ theory that an appointing
party would be deprived of its right to appoint arbitrators again in any subsequent new
proceeding contradicts not only the ordinary meaning of the terms of Articles 56(3), 52(6)
and 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention but also their purpose to establish general rules for
the constitution of a new tribunal, on the one hand, and react to a specific situation which

has occurred thereafter, on the other.2°

The Applicants interpret ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) as governing the composition of
a new tribunal upon annulment in light of ICSID Arbitration Rule 51, which is concerned
with interpretation and revision. Yet, it is useful to have revising and interpreting be done
by the same tribunal that rendered the award, and only if that is not possible shall a new
tribunal be constituted. The constitution of a new tribunal upon annulment is inherently

different.?°!

Therefore, the Centre and the Resubmission Tribunal respected the procedure provided for
in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules related to the constitution of the
Resubmission Tribunal, and “there is no basis whatsoever for Claimants’ assertion that
Chile was not entitled to appoint an arbitrator to the Resubmission Tribunal, and any

annulment claim that rests on that premise must therefore be rejected.”

With respect to the manifest excess of power, the Respondent submits as follows.

First, the First Tribunal’s explanations on the resignation of one arbitrator in paragraphs

34-37 of the First Award and the statement on Chile’s alleged delay tactics in paragraph

729 do not amount to a binding decision with res iudicata effect with respect to the
appointment of an arbitrator in the Resubmission Proceeding. Therefore, neither the Centre
nor the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded their power when accepting the appointment of

Mr. Mourre.?°

Second, the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail to exercise the authority bestowed upon it
by Articles 41(1) and 44 of the ICSID Convention. It has made a ruling on its competence
in accordance with Article 41(1) when it found that no action was required with respect to

Mr. Mourre’s appointment in the absence of a formal request for disqualification.?°*

Further, the Resubmission Tribunal conducted the proceeding in accordance with the
ICSID Convention and the Rules, when it respected the Convention’s directives that the
parties constitute the tribunal in accordance with Chapter IV Section 2, “which is exactly
what was done, with the Centre’s blessing.” Since there was no issue which was not
covered by the Convention and no “lacuna,” there was no place for a decision of the

Tribunal as required by Article 44 of the ICSID Convention.?°

With respect to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Respondent

submits as follows.

The Applicants asserted that the Resubmission Tribunal, by requiring them to make an
application for the disqualification of Mr. Mourre under Article 57 of the ICSID
Convention, committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure simply
because the application would have been inappropriate. They neither substantiated what
fundamental rule of procedure was in focus besides another simple assertion that due
process had not been respected nor of what the departure consisted. “This is plainly not

sufficient” to apply for annulment.?°°

336.

In addition, the Respondent submits that the Resubmission Tribunal acted correctly when
inviting the Applicants to make a formal application without which it would not be
authorised to rule on the matter either by inviting Mr. Mourre to resign or the Chairman to
appoint another arbitrator, since there “is simply no mechanism in the body of ICSID norms
that enables arbitrators to fire a co-arbitrator.”?”” In fact, an application in accordance with
Article 57 of the ICSID Convention does not only allow for the examination of the personal
qualities of an arbitrator as required according to Article 14 of the ICSID Convention but
also the determination of whether “he was ineligible for appointment.” That is exactly what
the Applicants’ complaint was about. In other words, the Tribunal’s invitation to make an
application under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention did not depart from a procedural rule
but indicated the procedurally correct way to trigger a formal determination of the

lawfulness of Mr. Mourre’s appointment.°°

The Applicants assert different facts and events for different grounds for annulment:

The appointment to and the continued membership in the Resubmission Tribunal of
President Berman and Mr. V.V. Veeder amount to an improper constitution of the
Tribunal (Article 52(1)(a)) of the ICSID Convention) and a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).?!*

- The Tribunal’s decision of 15 June 2017 constitutes an “excés de pouvoir, défaut de

motifs et manquement a une régle fondamentale de procedure.”?

The Applicants assert that, in sum, all circumstances, taken together, warrant the annulment
of the Resubmission Award under Article 52(1)(a), (b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID

Convention cumulatively or individually.

With respect to the improper constitution of the Tribunal, the Applicants submit as follows.

 

Close business relations existed between Chile and Essex Court Chambers “depuis au
moins une dizaine d’années,” i.e. throughout the period of the Resubmission Proceeding
and before and after it. It generated a significant and regular income to Essex Court
Chambers of “plusieurs millions voire dizaine de millions de dollars,” and of which
President Berman and Mr. Veeder, being members, profited at least indirectly. Chile was

“un client d’importance stratégique.””°

The fact that members of Essex Court Chambers not only acted in favour of but also against

Chile is irrelevant for the appraisal because it “n’explique ni n’excuse l’absence de

révélation par MM. Veeder et Berman, ou par la Défenderesse, des liens existant entre

certains membres des Essex Court Chambers et la République du Chili.”??!

These are circumstances which should have caused both to decline the appointment or to
step down as members of the Resubmission Tribunal, in accordance with the “IBA
Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration.” Theirs is the typical
situation as described in Article 1.4 as part of the Non-Waivable Red List when an
arbitrator derives significant financial income from advisory services that he/she or his/her

law firm dispenses to a party. Essex Court Chambers must be equated to a law firm, as they

22! Reply on Annulment, paras. 386.

86

present themselves like a law firm where individual barristers no longer act

independently.”

343. Even if one followed the concept of the IBA Guidelines according to which “barristers’
chambers should not be equated with law firms for the purposes of conflicts, and no general
standard is proffered for barristers’ chambers,” the same Guidelines provide that
“disclosure may be warranted in view of the relationships among barristers, parties or

counsel.”? In fact, both the “Waivable Red List” and the “Orange List” require full

disclosure, as widely confirmed in literature and case law.224

344. The obligation of disclosure in situations where business relations exist is commonly
accepted in case law, literature and guidelines on ethical and professional conduct of
arbitrators. In that sense, the ad hoc committee in Vivendi v. Argentina (II) held — in line
with other committees - that “it is for the arbitrator personally first to consider such a
connection in terms of a voluntary resignation as arbitrator. Such connection must

otherwise be properly disclosed to the parties through an adequate amendment of earlier

declarations under Rule 6.”??°

345. This duty to disclose also extends to publicly available information since arbitrators, as
explained in Tidewater v. Venezuela, are in a better position to gather and evaluate the

accurate information than the parties who would have to conduct difficult and intrusive

investigations “and rely on indirect and not always reliable sources.”?”°

Under the present circumstances, two connected aspects give rise to serious and objective
doubts as to President Berman’s and Mr. Veeder’s impartiality and independence as
required by Article 14 of the ICSID Convention and the objectively grounded suspicion
that they would seek to rule in Chile’s favour: first, the close business relationship between
Chile and Essex Court Chambers from which they profited, and second, the failure to
conduct an inquiry on these connections and disclose them, which — in the words of Article
4.1 of the “IBA Rules of Ethics for International Arbitrators” — “creates an appearance of

bias, and may of itself be a ground for disqualification.”

It is true that before their appointments, both President Berman and Mr. Veeder disclosed
that they are members of Essex Court Chambers, and, during the disqualification procedure
before the Chairman of the Administrative Council, that they did not and should not have
had knowledge about relations between Chile and other members of their Chambers. These
declarations are reproduced in the Chairman’s “Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Sir
Franklin Berman QC and Mr. V.V. Veeder QC” of 21 February 2017, in paragraphs 13 and

14. Such declarations are, the Applicants submit, des “tromperie[s]” and “mensongére[s]”:

Que les arbitres n’aient pas connaissance des montants

précis en cause peut se comprendre. Qu’ils prétendent

n’avoir pas eu connaissance de l'intervention de leurs

collégues pour la République du Chili reléve en revanche de

la gageure.””"
According to the Applicants, not only have President Berman and Mr. Veeder failed to
make a full disclosure of their Chambers’ long-standing, close, and lucrative relationship
with Chile, they have stubbornly, fraudulently and in bad faith refused to start or even
facilitate an in-depth inquiry into this relationship.?”°
This conduct leaves no doubt that both President Berman and Mr. Veeder manifestly lack

the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, and that they cannot

“be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.” In fact, the doubt and suspicion have

amply materialized, since both arbitrators demonstrated a systematic bias in favor of Chile.

For these reasons, both President Berman and Mr. Veeder must be disqualified, the
Resubmission Tribunal was not properly constituted and the ad hoc Committee must annul

the Award.
The ad hoc Committee has the authority and the duty to proceed accordingly.

It is true that the Chairman of the Administrative Council formally rejected the request for
disqualification on two occasions and for different reasons by his two Decisions “on the
Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman QC” dated
21 February 2017 and 13 April 2017. It is also true that other ad hoc committees - for
instance in EDF v. Argentina and Suez v. Argentina - have found that in such

circumstances:

[T]he role of an ad hoc committee is not to determine
whether or not an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities
of independence and impartiality; Articles 57 and 58 entrust
that function to the remaining members of the tribunal, or to
the Chairman of the Administrative Council. Only if the
matter is raised for the first time after the proceedings are
closed does the ad hoc committee become the primary
decision-maker in respect of this issue;?2?

and:

[A] decision has been made on this issue [of the proper
constitution of the Tribunal] in the underlying proceedings
and in light of the context as well as the object and purpose
of the annulment proceeding, it is not for this Committee to
perform a de novo review of any issues decided in the
underlying proceedings.”*°

354.

However, under the circumstances of the present proceeding, a de novo determination on
the disqualification and, thus, on the improper constitution of the Tribunal is required

because the Chairman’s Decisions:

- were taken after the Resubmission procedure;

- did not take the merits into account and concentrated on purely procedural
considerations and thereby have no res iudicata effect, at least as far as the Decision of
21 February 2017 is concerned;

- could not take facts into consideration that emerged only after the Chairman’s
decisions; and

- are untenable and manifestly unreasonable.”?!

Both the ad hoc committees in EDF v. Argentina and Suez v. Argentina confirm this
approach. They ruled that an ad hoc committee has the authority to determine the reasons
for the disqualification of arbitrators anew, if the Chairman’s decision “not to disqualify
the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker
could have come to such a decision.”?*? Both committees have correctly dismissed the
narrow approach of the ad hoc committee in Azurix v. Argentina which had held that a
committee “would only be able to annul an award under Article 52(1)(a) if there had been
a failure to comply properly with the procedure for challenging members of the tribunal set
out in other provisions of the ICSID Convention.””* The Azurix approach neglects
evidently the necessity to protect the ICSID system against partial and biased tribunals.?**

decided upon by the Chairman of the Administrative Council finds further support in the

annulment committee’s decision in Mobil v. Argentina. °°

In the present case, both Decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council of 21
February 2017 and 13 April 2017 are manifestly untenable and so plainly unreasonable that
no reasonable decision maker could have come to such decisions. Further, they constitute
a serious departure from ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 and an excess of power, together with

(in the case of the Decision of 13 April 2017) a lack of reasons.?*°

With respect to the Decision of 21 February 2017, which rejects the proposal to disqualify
Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder for purely procedural reasons, the Chairman has
simply followed Chile’s biased arguments and documentation through press clippings
covering a period from 2012 to 2016, according to which the relations between Chile and

Essex Court Chambers were publicly known and regularly reported in the press.

The Chairman has taken these submissions to deduce that “les Demanderesses auraient dit
avoir connaissance du fait que certains membres des Essex Court Chambers intervenaient
ou étaient intervenus par le passé pour la République du Chili au moment du déroulement
de la procédure en resoumission.”**" In reality, the press clippings mention a number of
people acting as counsel for Chile but none mentions Essex Court Chambers itself. The
available information was not detailed and notorious enough to arouse doubts and suspicion
and it would have been manifestly unreasonable and excessive to start a systematic inquiry
on the connection of the individuals mentioned with Chile and Essex Court Chambers.

Before appointing Mr. Veeder, the Applicants had searched for a person who would

guarantee quality, prestige and independence and be “at the level of the President, who

was member of Essex Court Chambers.

It was not the Applicants’ duty to investigate relations between Essex Court Chambers and

Chile but the arbitrators’ duty to disclose it.

Only a few days after the notification of the Resubmission Award, on 18 September 2016,
the press published an article which revealed relations between Chile and a member of
Essex Court Chambers, specifying that until then these relations had been kept secret
(“sigilosa’). The Applicants acted promptly upon this information. As from 20 September
2016, they started to investigate the relations themselves, and they requested in repeated
communications to the Centre, that the arbitrators conduct an in-depth inquiry into the

relations, which was refused in bad faith.

The Chairman of the Administrative Council exceeded his powers, departed from a

fundamental rule of procedure and acted unreasonably by:
- assuming that it was the Applicants’ duty to conduct a conflict search;

- believing Chile’s arguments, failing to examine the press clippings and to add even

new ones sua sponte that he had never shared with the Applicants;

- not ordering Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder to make an inquiry into the relations

between Chile and Essex Court Chambers;

- not taking into consideration that the relations had been kept secret and therefore out

of reach of the Applicants; and

- defining the period from which to determine whether the Applicants had acted
“promptly” in the sense of Rules 9 and 27 from the moment of the appointment of the

arbitrators and not from the moment when the Applicants started to have access to

secret information, which would undoubtedly lead him to understand that “le caractére

prompt de la réaction des Demanderesses est manifeste.””?

With respect to the Chairman’s Decision of 13 April 2017 rejecting the proposal to
disqualify Mr. Veeder, the Applicants assert that the Chairman has blindly believed Mr.
Veeder’s consciously false and prejudiced statements on his motivation why he had
resigned from an arbitral tribunal in a different case under circumstances similar to the ones
in the present case. The Chairman has failed to appraise the Applicants’ evidence proving
that Mr. Veeder’s intention was to occult the fact that objectively the resignation was
motivated by facts identical to the facts in the present case. By not taking these facts into
consideration, the Chairman reached the untenable and unreasonable decision not to

disqualify Mr. Veeder.

Therefore, the Committee must disregard the Chairman’s Decision of 13 April 2017 and

annul the Resubmission Award.”

With respect to the Chairman’s Decision of 13 April 2017 rejecting the proposal to
disqualify Sir Franklin Berman, the Applicants assert a failure to apply the law. The
Chairman has rejected the proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin, although the latter had
written a letter on 1 March 2017 whereby he announced that he would abstain from
fulfilling his obligations under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention. The letter evidences
“d’un défaut de motifs et d’un biais qualifié défavorable évident a l’égard de celles-ci [the
Applicants], incompatible avec des principes fondamentaux du droit -due process- et le
niveau d’exigence de neutralité et impartialité des articles 57, 14(1) et 42(1) en rapport

avec les articles 52(1)e) et 52(1)(d) de la Convention du CIRDI.”*"'

243,

The Centre, in a “coincidence immédiate,”*? had accepted President Berman’s withdrawal
from the exercise of his functions under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and decided
that the Chairman would decide the matter although nothing in the Convention authorises
him to do so. This is an issue of the international ordre public, and the Chairman’s Decision
of 13 April 2017 is a manifestation of an excess of power with lack of reasons and a serious

departure from Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.?4*

For all these reasons, both Decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council are
untenable, unreasonable and made in violation of basic provisions of the ICSID
Convention. The ad hoc Committee must not take them in consideration and determine de
novo whether President Berman and Mr. Veeder must be disqualified and, as a

consequence, whether the Tribunal was not properly constituted, which is beyond doubt.

With respect to the manifest excess of powers, the Applicants submit as follows.

Five decisions constitute an excess of power and warrant the annulment of the Award based

on Article 52(1)(b).

First, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal, communicated by letter of 21 November
201674 to refuse full disclosure of the relations between Chile and Essex Court

Chambers.”

Second, the decision taken by President Berman in his letter of 1 March 2017 not to fulfil
his duty to participate in the procedure leading to the disqualification of Mr. Veeder, as
complemented by the Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council, dated

13 April 2017, to take over this duty.

Fifth, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal dated 15 June 2017 to refuse the well-
founded Applicants’ request to order Chile to produce documents to evidence the closeness
and dimension of the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers. Chile had refused

1

to produce these documents on 12 April 2017 without valid reason,”°! as later stated by

Chilean courts.”

The incomprehensible?

refusal by the Resubmission Tribunal to order the production of
documents in accordance with Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID
Arbitration Rules 53/34(2)(a), which would have proven that the premises of the
Chairman’s Decision on the disqualification did not exist, demonstrate that “[l]es
comportements du Tribunal de Resoumission et de l’Etat Défendeur sont objectivement
concordants en vue de préserver l’opacité des rapports entre ce dernier et les chambers
dont sont membres deux des arbitres.’?*4 In fact, the Resubmission Tribunal has acted
fraudulently and outside its competence and immunity when it refused information in

concertation with Chile, a strategic client of their Chambers.”>>
Therefore, the Committee must annul the Award in accordance with Article 52(1)(b).

With respect to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants

submit as follows.
Six decisions constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

First, Sir Franklin Berman’s and Mr. Veeder’s failure to decline the appointment as
President and Arbitrator respectively of the Resubmission Tribunal or to resign at a later
moment, as well as the refusal to disqualify despite the close connection between Chile and

Essex Court Chambers, have not only caused the improper constitution of the Tribunal but

constitute, at the same time, a serious departure from one of the most fundamental rules of
procedure, namely the legitimate expectation of each party that all members of a tribunal
act completely independently, impartially and without bias and that no reasonable person
may have a legitimate doubt as to that impartiality. The Applicants rely on EDF v.

Argentina, where the ad hoc committee held:

Tf an award may be tainted by the fact that a decision whether
or not to disqualify an arbitrator was taken in a manner which
was procedurally deficient, a fortiori an award may be
tainted by the fact that the award itself was adopted by a
tribunal one or more of whose members did not meet the
requisite standard of impartiality and independence.

The Committee therefore considers that the fact that there is
reasonable doubt about whether an arbitrator possessed the
qualities of independence and impartiality required by
Article 14(1) is a ground on which an award might be
annulled under Article 52(1)(d).?°°

Second, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal, communicated by letter of
21 November 2016, to refuse full disclosure of the relations between Chile and Essex Court
Chambers “[constitue] un manque de neutralité et d’impartialité de la part du Tribunal et
de chacun de ses membres et une inobservance grave des régles de procédure applicables
(Régle n° 6 en rapport avec l'article 14)1) de la Convention), sanctionnée a l'article

52(1)(a) de la Convention.”>"

Third, the Decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council of 21 February 2017
and 13 April 2017 with respect to the disqualification of Mr. Veeder constitute a serious
departure from Article 6 of the ICSID Convention, and with respect to the disqualification
of Sir Franklin Berman a serious departure from Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID
Convention. The decisions cannot validate the serious departure from procedural rules

applicable during the processing of the proposals for disqualification.

Fourth, both the decision taken by Sir Franklin Berman in his letter of 1 March 2017 not to
fulfil his duty to participate in the procedure leading to the disqualification of Mr. Veeder,
and the complementary Decision by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, dated
13 April 2017, to take over this duty, constitute a serious departure from Article 57 and 58
of the ICSID Convention. They cannot validate the serious departure from “des régles de

procédure applicables lors du traitement des propositions de récusation de M. Berman.”?°*

Fifth, the decision of the Resubmission Tribunal, dated 15 June 2017, to refuse the well-
founded Applicants’ request to order Chile to produce documents to evidence the closeness
and dimension of the relations between Chile and Essex Court Chambers constitutes a
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for the same reasons that it exceeds

the Tribunal’s power, as shown in paragraphs 366 ss. here above.?°°

With respect to the failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based, the Applicants

submit as follows.

The Resubmission Tribunal failed to state the reasons why it did not apply ICSID

Arbitration Rule 6(2) despite the Applicants’ repeated requests in that sense.7°°

In his letter of 1 March 2017, President Berman failed to state the reasons why he denied

fulfilling his duty to participate in the procedure to disqualify Mr. Veeder despite repeated

communications from the Applicants.7°!

The Chairman of the Administrative Council has failed to state the reasons why it accepted

to rule on the proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder dated 24 February 2017.7?

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Applicants’ request to annul the Resubmission Award
because the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID
Convention) and because an award rendered by an improperly constituted Tribunal
represents a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of

the ICSID Convention) is without merit.7©

The Respondent asserts as follows:

The Tribunal was properly constituted in late 2013 and beginning 2014, in accordance with
Chapter IV, Section 2 of the ICSID Convention (“Constitution of the Tribunal’). Chile
appointed Mr. Mourre. The Secretary-General appointed Sir Franklin Berman who had
declared that he was member of Essex Court Chambers. Sir Franklin Berman’s
appointment having been accepted by both Parties, and the Applicants appointed
Mr. Veeder, knowing full well that he, like Sir Franklin Berman, was a member of Essex

Court Chambers.”

The Applicants have not objected to the constitution of the Tribunal. In reality, they contest
the composition and not the constitution of the Tribunal, which is not a ground for

annulment.?°

Further, and more importantly, the Chairman of the Administrative Council confirmed the
proper constitution of the Tribunal in two Decisions on the Applicants’ repeated proposals

to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder.

The Applicants’ request to annul the Award amounts to an appeal against the Decisions of

the Chairman, which is inadmissible: “an annulment committee cannot re-open or second-

guess the legal and factual findings set forth in a challenge decision.””° Unlike what the
Applicants assert, the annulment committee in Mobil v. Argentina did not widen the scope
of permissible review in such circumstances, but explicitly validated the approach taken

by the annulment committees in EDF v. Argentina and Suez v. Argentina.?5"

As far as the Applicants ask the Committee to disregard the Decisions of the Chairman of
the Administrative Council and decide on the disqualification de novo, because they are
allegedly plainly unreasonable, the argument is unfounded. First, the “Challenge Decision
[...] was reasoned, well supported, and consistent with the jurisprudence on the timeliness
of challenges.”?°* Second, the Applicants’ request and “theory [appear] to part from the
premise that, until 18 September 2016, it simply was unknowable that certain Essex Court
Chambers barristers had been representing Chile in ICJ proceedings.” That is simply not
true because the facts were repeatedly reported in the Chilean press and were also readily
accessible on different websites. Chile’s objections to disclose sensitive documents in local
Chilean courts do not change the general evidence that “Chile’s representation by Essex
Court Chambers barristers in ICJ matters had long been public knowledge.” The Chairman
of the Administrative Council had based his Decision of 21 February 2017 on these facts,

which is plainly reasonable.”

Under these circumstances, the Applicants’ proposal to disqualify Sir Franklin and
Mr. Veeder was untimely. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1), it should have
been made “promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed.” The
Respondent relies on the EDF v. Argentina annulment decision, where the committee

found:

[A] party which is, or should have been, aware of the facts
which it claims give rise to reasonable doubt about whether
an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities of

independence and impartiality has a duty to raise the issue

promptly. [...] A party which could have raised the matter

under Articles 57 and 58 before the proceedings were

declared closed but failed to do so cannot, therefore, raise it

on annulment.?”°
In any event, Chile’s representation by other Essex Court Chambers barristers in unrelated
cases has not caused a conflict of interest that may shed an objective and justifiable doubt
on President Berman’s or Mr. Veeder’s independence and impartiality. They both disclosed
their membership, they both did not and were not supposed to know about the activities of
other members, they both acted as self-employed sole practitioners, as explained on the
Essex Court Chambers website,””! and the Applicants did not doubt their independence
when they appointed one member of Essex Court Chambers after having approved another
member of the same Chambers. The Respondent quotes an eminent tribunal’s conviction

that there is no:

[H]ard-and-fast rule to the effect that barristers from the
same Chambers are always precluded from being involved
as, respectively, counsel and arbitrator in the same case.
Equally, however, there is no absolute rule to opposite effect.
The justifiability of an apprehension of partiality depends on
all relevant circumstances.”””

In light of these considerations, there can be no doubt that there is no conflict of interest in

cases where barristers from the same chambers act in different cases.?”°

The Applicants’ reference to the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International
Arbitration is of no avail since the Guidelines state unequivocally that “barristers’

chambers should not be equated with law firms for the purposes of conflicts.”?”

THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S TREATMENT OF THE EVIDENCE AND BURDEN OF PROOF
(dd) The Applicants’ Position

The Applicants have asserted three grounds for annulment relating to the Resubmission
Tribunal’s treatment of the evidence that they have presented regarding the damage
sustained by them as a consequence of Chile’s violation of the BIT and of the burden of

proof in that respect:

(a) That the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));

(b) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
(Article 52(1)(d)); and

(c) That the Resubmission Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based

(Article 52(1)(e)).275

The Applicants argue that most of the facts and arguments presented under this heading
relate at the same time to the disregard of the res iudicata effect of the First Award but
have chosen to separate the issues. The approach does not cause inconveniences except for

possible redundancies, and the Committee accepts it.

With respect to a manifest excess of powers, the Applicants submit as follows.

 

“[L]e rejet des arguments et éléments de preuve présentées par les Demanderesses et se
rapportant a la démonstration de leur préjudice résultant des violations identifiées par la

Sentence Initiale constitue un exces de pouvoir manifeste.”?"°

The Applicants assert that they have consistently provided detailed and coherent arguments
and evidence with regard to the damages caused by the unfair and unequitable treatment

by Chile both in their written submissions and in oral presentation during the Resubmission

Proceeding and through financial expertise. As summarised during the hearing before the

Resubmission Tribunal on 13 April 2015:

[NJous avons établi que la violation du déni de justice et
l'absence de jugement de la premiére Chambre civile de
Santiago a finalement détruit le droit a réparation des
Demanderesses au titre de l'API en application de son
article 5 devant le Tribunal arbitral.

Dans ces conditions, dés lors que le dommage doit venir
rétablir les Demanderesses dans la situation dans laquelle
elles se seraient trouvées en l’absence de violation, et donc
en l’absence de déni de justice, la position que nous
défendons est que la violation de l'article 4 et le déni de
justice du Chili doivent étre réparés en accordant une
réparation aux Demanderesses équivalente a celle qu'elles
auraient di obtenir au titre des confiscations.2”

408. The Resubmission Tribunal refused to take the evidence into consideration as far as it

clarifies the circumstances of the violent confiscation in 1973. It reasons that:

[I]t is res judicata both (positively) that the breach consists
in the composite failure to accord fair and equitable
treatment (including the avoidance of denial of justice), and
also (negatively) that the expropriation of the original
investment is outside the temporal scope of the BIT, so that
all evidence and argument related to that expropriation is to
be excluded as not relevant to the dispute other than as
background facts.?”8

409. In reality, the First Tribunal had determined, res iudicata, that facts preceding the date of
the BIT, i.e. 29 March 1994, must be taken into consideration when examining the factual
context of the acts that the Applicants have qualified as violations of the BIT after its entry

into force.?”

Therefore, the Resubmission Tribunal failed to exercise its power and to examine the
evidence brought before it concerning “les éléments de fait antérieurs a l’entrée en vigueur
de VAPI"280

At the same time, the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers when refusing to take
issues into consideration that occurred after (“postérieur”)**! 3 November 1997, the date
of the initial request for arbitration. On another occasion, the Applicants submitted that the
Tribunal has “indiiment décliné sa compétence s’agissant d’actes de déni de justice

postérieurs a la Sentence Initiale,”**? which is 8 May 2008.

The Applicants observe that with respect to the denial of justice occurring after the First
Award, the Resubmission Tribunal has stated that this argument falls outside of its
jurisdiction, which is limited to to the dispute submitted to the First Tribunal and for which

the critical date was the original Request for Arbitration:

The Tribunal should also interpolate at this point that part of
the argument addressed to it by the Claimants in these
resubmission proceedings was to the effect that the actions
of the Respondent, since the handing down of the First
Award, constituted a new denial of justice for which
compensation is due, and can be awarded in these
resubmission proceedings. This is an argument that the
Tribunal must reject outright. The reason is not only that
allegations of that kind would have to be subjected to a
proper process of evidence and proof before they could
properly come to decision in an arbitral process (which
indeed they would); it is quite simply that the entire
argument falls plainly outside the jurisdiction of the present
Tribunal, which (as already indicated) is limited, under
Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 55 of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules, exclusively to ‘the dispute’ or such
parts of it as remain in being after the annulment. That can
only be taken to refer to ‘the dispute’ that had been submitted
to arbitration in the first place, the critical date for which was
the Claimants’ original request for arbitration. Issues arising

between the Parties after that date — and still more so issues
arising out of post-Award conduct — cannot by any stretch of
the imagination fall within the scope of resubmission
proceedings under the provisions cited above, and the
Tribunal sees no need to say more about the matter in this
Award.?83

The Applicants assert that this reasoning contradicts the first Tribunal’s assessment of
Chile’s violations of Article 4 of the BIT that is based on factual and legal elements that
have occurred between 1995 and 2002, i.e. the proceeding before the Chilean court on the
restitution of the Goss machine, and the compensation of persons other than Mr. Pey
through Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000. They reduce the Applicants’ rights to present

arguments and evidence referring to events after 1997.

This excess of power is manifest because it can be distilled without a problem by simply
reading the First Award, the First Annulment Decision, the Resubmission Award and by
recalling a “besoin élémentaire: en quoi une base de chiffrage peut-elle étre déclarée

inexacte pour toute évaluation au prétexte qu’une prétention n’a pas été acceptée ratione

temporis.”?*+

The Applicants rely on a commentator of the Resubmission Award, Professor Benjamin

Remy, who expressed doubts as to the rejection of the evidence:

En revanche, elle n’interdit pas que, dans le cadre de
T’examen de la demande d’indemnisation du préjudice subi
du fait du déni de justice, la réalité de la confiscation soit
évoquée. Plus précisément, ce préjudice consistait en une
perte de chance pour l’investisseur d’obtenir gain de cause
aupres des juridictions chiliennes. [...] Il est seulement
question de savoir si, au regard du seul droit chilien, la
prétention formulée par Vinvestisseur devant les juges
chiliens avait des chances de prospérer et de fixer le montant
des indemnités que l’investisseur aurait pu espérer. Les
éléments de preuve et les arguments relatifs aux
confiscations de 1973, ainsi utilisés, ne devraient donc pas

se heurter a l’autorité de la chose jugée de la sentence
initiale.?®5

With respect to a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure, the Applicants

submit as follows.

The Resubmission Tribunal has systematically accepted Chile’s arguments and its negative
characterisation of the First Award and the First Annulment Decision, to the detriment of

the Applicants’ arguments and evidence. It has underlined, in paragraph 208 of the

 

Resubmission Award, the difficulty to understand the First Award and has regretted, in
paragraph 211 of the Resubmission Award, not to be allowed to re-open the debate instead
of the First Committee. The Resubmission Tribunal’s conclusions were predetermined and
driven by the desire to bring the dispute to an end and “rendre inefficace l’obligation
d’indemniser établie dans la Sentence initiale.”?*° These are manifestations of partiality
and bias, i.e. a violation of one of the most fundamental duties of arbitral tribunals.”
Further, and as an additional demonstration of bias, the Resubmission Tribunal failed to
take the Applicants’ evidence into account and give it serious consideration:

La décision décision du TR d’écarter les arguments soutenus

et les preuves produites par les Demanderesses, puis de

considérer que celles-ci n’ont pas satisfait a la charge de la

preuve qui pesait sur elle n’est que l'aboutissement des
autres manifestations du parti pris du Tribunal.

 

With respect to the failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based, the Applicants

submit as follows.

The Applicants have submitted coherent arguments and a detailed opinion, backed by

abundant case law, doctrine and expert advice, on the damage caused by Respondent’s

violation of its duty to treat them fairly and equitably. In particular, they have demonstrated
that “Jes tribunaux arbitraux ont accepté que le principe de réparation intégrale implique
que l’investisseur puisse étre indemnisé pour la valeur de ses biens saisis, quand bien
méme sa demande n’ était pas fondée sur l’expropriation mais sur la violation du traitement
juste et équitable apres l’entrée en vigueur de l’API le 29 mars 1994.”?°° Even the
Respondent’s financial expert admitted that the calculation of damages caused by unfair
and unequitable treatment could be based on a fair market value and therefore lead to a
quantum “equivalent au calcul résultant d’une expropriation.”?”°

In light of these presentations, the Tribunal’s failure to discuss the evidence presented by
the Parties and its simple affirmation that the Applicants have not discharged their burden

of proof of their prejudice are “incompréhensibles,” “frivoles” et “grossiérement

insuffisants.”*”! As correctly stated by the ad hoc committee in TECO v. Guatemala, it is
inadmissible for a tribunal to:

[S]imply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have

placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and

without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient,

unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory. A tribunal is duty

bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of

evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their

case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the
reasons for this conclusion.”

In violation of its duty, the Tribunal has:
- presented only a “résumé sommaire” of the Applicants’ pleadings;
- completely failed to discuss the Applicants’ arguments and evidence;

- not quoted one of the multiple awards and decisions that the Applicants presented; and

- not at all mentioned the debate between the Applicants and the financial experts,

especially with the Respondent’s expert during the hearing.”
(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent refutes the Applicants’ arguments and requests annulment for all three

asserted grounds. It submits as follows.

With respect to facts, arguments and evidence anterior to the entry into force of the BIT in
1994, it is simply not true that the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers by refusing
to hear and consider the Applicants’ arguments and evidence.”** On the contrary, the
Tribunal explained that it has “done its utmost to listen with careful and sympathetic
attention to all of the arguments that have been brought before it by the Parties in writing
and orally, without seeking to apply in advance any a priori criterion of selection as to

which of them would ultimately prove relevant and material to its Award.”

In fact, the Applicants have taken full advantage of the opportunity to present their case
“submitting expert reports and hundreds of exhibits and authorities — many of which

addressed the very point that Claimants now say they were prevented from addressing.”?°°

It is true that the Tribunal excluded the evidence relating to the Applicants’ expropriation
in 1973-1975, as explained in the Award’s paragraphs 217, 228 and 230. However, in doing
so, the Tribunal has not failed to exercise its jurisdiction or to apply the proper law. Rather,
it has respected ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) obliging it not to reconsider any unannulled
portion of the award, and in this perspective, the res iudicata findings of the First Tribunal.
As a result, the Tribunal correctly explained that it had no authority to take such evidence

into consideration.

The First Tribunal held that the expropriation had been completed in 1975, that the
provisions of the BIT were not applicable to the expropriation ratione temporis, that acts
having occurred after 1994 could not be taken into account as expropriatory (because the
same objects cannot be expropriated twice), and that the violations of the BIT after 1994 —
the denial of justice and the compensation of individuals other than Mr. Pey through
Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 — were distinct from the expropriation.””” The First
Tribunal had reasoned:

L’ expropriation survenue avant l’entrée en vigueur du traité

ayant été écartée de l’examen du Tribunal arbitral, il en

résulte que, pour cette raison déja, les allégations,

discussions et preuves relatives au dommage subi par les

demanderesses du fait de l'expropriation, manquent de

pertinence et ne peuvent pas étre retenues s’agissant

d'établir un préjudice, résultant lui d'une autre cause, de fait

et de droit, celle du déni de justice et du refus d'un

“traitement juste et équitable” .*
Even if these arguments figure in the annulled Chapter VIII of the First Award, they only
repeat what the Tribunal had found in the unannulled Chapter VII. The Applicants’
criticism of the Resubmission Tribunal’s interpretation of the First Award in this respect,
and their efforts to replace it by their own vision of what is res iudicata, “is just a direct,

unabashed appeal of the Resubmission Award, and thus plainly inappropriate.”?”

Finally, the Applicants failed to explain in what way the alleged excess of powers was

manifest.*°°

With respect to facts, arguments and evidence posterior to the initial request for arbitration
on 3 November 1997, the Applicants have misrepresented the Resubmission Tribunal’s

reasoning.

First, paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award does not address Article 4 violations that
the First Tribunal had found but considers alleged violations occurring after the First
Award. Second, it does not exclude any evidence at all. In fact, in paragraph 228(c) of its
Award, the Resubmission Tribunal states explicitly that it “draws [this] conclusion from
the above” (including paragraph 216) the interpretation of the res iudicata part of the First
Award leads to the conclusion, opposite to the Applicants’ assertion:

[T]hat there was a breach of the guarantee of fair and

equitable treatment under Article 4, which consisted of the

totality of the conduct of the Chilean authorities resulting in

the seven-year delay in the Goss press litigation and

Decision No. 43, and manifested itself in the award of

compensation to persons who were not the owners of the

assets confiscated while Mr Pey Casado’s claims were

rejected.*°!
Obviously, the Respondent argues, the dates of all the events having caused a violation of
the FET obligations are posterior to the request for arbitration and were readily accepted
as falling within the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding, thus belying the Applicants’
allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal refused to take facts, arguments and evidence

into account that post-date 3 November 1997.

With respect to a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Respondent argues

 

that the Applicants’ allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal discarded relevant evidence
without hearing it is belied by the fact that expert reports were submitted and discussed

during the evidentiary hearing.

The Applicants try to curtail the Tribunal’s authority as expressed in ICSID Arbitration
Rule 34(1) according to which the tribunal is the “judge of the admissibility of any evidence

and of its probative value.”

The Applicants bore the burden to prove that Chile’s violations of its duty to treat them
fairly and equitably (Article 4 as opposed to Article 5 of the BIT) caused injury and

quantum. They had ample opportunity to address the issues but have conscientiously failed

to do so, for instance by instructing their expert to quantify only the losses caused by the
expropriation and not by the distinct denial of justice and further unfair and unequitable

treatment.

The tactical reason behind this was to avoid a calculation of damages based on the 7-years
delay of Chilean court proceedings and on the government’s Decision to compensate other
people, because such calculation would have led to minimal quanta. However, the strategy
“had zero chance of succeeding,” given that the First Tribunal had determined with res
iudicata effect that the violations of Articles 4 and 5 were distinct and that the evidence for

an expropriation claim was of no use for a FET claim.*°

The Resubmission Tribunal was bound to follow the First Tribunal’s res iudicata
determination, as it has explained convincingly. In exercising its authority and “after
having evaluated the evidence and arguments of the parties, the Resubmission Tribunal
determined that Claimants’ theories were inapposite” to evidence the causation of damages

by FET-standard violations.*°°

As to the inappropriate allegations of bias, they are based on pure speculation. The
Respondent refers to the First Annulment Decision which has rejected a request for
annulment based on speculative allegations of bias by accepting the Applicants’ arguments
that a committee cannot declare “Ja nullité d’une sentence sur un simple apparence de

partialité,” and that “l’accusation de partialité du Tribunal ou de ses membres ne doit pas

étre fondée sur des simples spéculations.”*°*

With respect to the alleged failure to state reasons on which the Award was based, the

 

Resubmission Tribunal has, in paragraphs 198, 217, and 232 of the Award, provided
“ample explanation as to why Claimants’ expropriation-based theories could not be

accepted. Claimants very well may disagree with that explanation but [as Schreuer

explains] [i]t cannot be expected [...] that reasons must go to such length as to persuade a

disgruntled party why it has lost.”°°°

In fact, the Tribunal has articulated its reasons that have led it to ascertain that the
Applicants failed to discharge their burden to prove injury caused by FET-standard

violations in 11 steps. The reasons are consistent and can be easily followed.*°°

THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S FAILURE TO GIVE RES IUDICATA EFFECT TO

UNANNULLED FINDINGS
dd) The Applicants’ Position

The Applicants have asserted three grounds for annulment relating to the Resubmission

Tribunal’s alleged failure to give res iudicata effect to unannulled findings:

(a) That the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));

(b) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
(Article 52(1)(d)); and

(c) That the Resubmission Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based

(Article 52(1)(e)).307

With respect to a manifest excess of powers, the Applicants submit as follows.

 

The Applicants observe that the First Tribunal has determined in paragraphs 627-674, with
res iudicata effect, that the Respondent violated its duty to afford the Applicants fair and
equitable treatment by discriminating against them when it compensated other individuals

for the illegal expropriation and not Mr. Pey, and by denying justice through the

unreasonable duration of court proceedings. It has summarised its adjudication in
paragraph 674 of the Award as follows:

[E]n résumé, en accordant des compensations — pour des

raisons qui lui sont propres et sont restées inexpliquées — a

des personnages qui, de l’avis du Tribunal arbitral, n’étaient

pas propriétaires des biens confisqués, en méme temps

qu'elle paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey

Casado concernant les biens confisqués, la République du

Chili a manifestement commis un déni de justice et refusé de
traiter les demanderesses de fagon juste et équitable.

and decided, in paragraph 3 of the dispositif:

[L]es demanderesses ont droit a compensation.

It follows from there that “[n]i /’existence d’un préjudice ni l’existence d’un dommage
corrélatif ni la nécessité d’une indemnité financiére pour compenser celui-ci ne font le

moindre doute pour la Sentence initiale.”**

The First Committee upheld this part of the First Award as res iudicata.*© It decided that
“la SI [the First Award] a correctement tranché que les Demanderesses avaient produit la
preuve des faits et des fondement juridiques de la responsabilité de ’ Etat du Chili pour la

9310

violation du traité, as much so as their burden to identify and prove the damage.*!!

Therefore, the Applicants argue, the role of the Resubmission Tribunal was limited:
“compte-tenu des violations de V'API Espagne-Chili par le Chili aprés la date du
3 novembre 1997, et du droit & compensation reconnu aux Demanderesses, bénéficiant de
Vautorité de la chose jugée de la Sentence initiale, son réle était de déterminer le montant

de V'indemnité a accorder aux Demanderesses.”*'

The limitation was even obvious to outside commentators, as documented by a

commentary on the First Annulment Decision by Professor Schreuer who opined:

In the resubmitted proceedings, initiated in June 2013, the

Tribunal will be restricted to determining the amount of

damages flowing from the first Tribunal’s finding of liability

which is res judicata.*!
It is equally incontestable, the Applicants argue, that the First Tribunal determined, with
res iudicata effect, that “les Demanderesses avaient acquis un droit & indemnisation de
nature pécuniaire, et que tel était le sens du terme ‘compensation’ employé notamment
dans le dispositif de la Sentence initiale.”*'* The Tribunal has clearly established “que la
combinaison des actions et omissions constitutif [sic] de la conduite internationalement
illicite du Chili & partir de 1995, tout au moins pris dans leur ensemble, avaient eu l’effet
de bloquer toute possibilité raisonnable de redressement, a l’intérieur du systéme politico-
légal chilien, de la saisie et confiscation illégale et inconstitutionnelle, que ce soit par

restitution ou compensation.”>'>

The correct legal base for defining the term “compensation” are Articles 31-37 of the
Articles on State Responsibility. Article 36, in conjunction with Article 31, leaves no doubt
that compensation is the correct remedy for “any financially assessable damage” caused by
internationally wrongful acts as perpetuated by the Respondent, and not satisfaction, as
wrongly decided by the Resubmission Tribunal, since the injury in the present case of a
damaged investment can “be made good by [...] compensation,” as provided for in Article
37 of the Articles on State Responsibility.*'® Investment disputes are not about the
protection of honour but about the violation and reparation of economic interests.

Pecuniary compensation is the adequate remedy, as confirmed by ample literature.*!”

All these res iudicata findings of the First Tribunal were final and binding and could not
be reconsidered by the Resubmission Tribunal. This is clearly stated in ICSID Arbitration

Rule 55(3) as it is “an essential and settled rule of international law.”*!®

Totally ignoring the finality of the unannulled findings of the First Award, the
Resubmission Tribunal reopened the debate and analysis, through four questions asked

during the hearing*!?

related to (i) the Applicants’ investment, (ii) the concept of
compensation, (iii) the status of Decree No. 165 and (iv) the meaning of Decision No. 43

and decided the issues anew, under the guise of interpretation.

Certainly, the Applicants argue, arbitral tribunals have a “certain pouvoir d’interprétation,
essentiellement dicté par la nécessité de comprendre pour appliquer.”*°° However, this
power is restricted to an “interpretative controversy” and must not be misused to undermine
the res iudicata effect, in particular where there is no disagreement between the parties on

a given issue.*7!

The Applicants rely on Amco v. Indonesia (II) to back their arguments that committees
have the right to verify whether an interpretation is reasonable and does not interfere with
the res iudicata principle. The ad hoc committee had found:

If a new Tribunal reconsiders an issue not annulled, it

exceeds its power. [...] Its interpretation could be considered

as a manifest excess of powers only if it were manifestly

outside any bona fide interpretation of the first committee’s

decision and therefore obviously untenable.*?*
In the present case, the Resubmission Tribunal acted in bad faith and has not solved an
interpretative controversy but created one by ignoring the agreement of the parties and the

unambiguous language of the First Award.

Here, the Applicants assert, the Resubmission Tribunal:

redefined the concept of compensation against the determination of the First Tribunal

and against the clear substance of international law;

disregarded the Parties’ agreement on the definition of compensation as being

necessarily pecuniary;

refused to accept the First Tribunal’s ascertainment that the Respondent has violated

its duty to guarantee fair and equitable treatment and to abstain from denial of justice;
rejected evidence that the First Tribunal had accepted;

failed to accept prejudice, causality and damage as proven and has denied the existence

of material damage, against the First Tribunal’s findings in the opposite sense;

refused to determine the quantum of damages in accordance with its limited mandate

conferred to it by the First annulment Decision;

consistently confounded injury, damage and compensation against the clear

determination of the First Tribunal as validated by the First Committee; and

distorted the First Committee’s findings when it declares that the First Committee
interpreted the First Tribunal as believing that ‘Claimants’ arguments on damages were
strictly limited to ones founded on the expropriation” (Resubmission Award, paragraph

229), where in reality the Committee had only found on a contradiction.*”*

The Applicants argue that this reasoning and determination by the Resubmission Tribunal
is partly an exercise of authority and power that it did not have, partly a rejection of the
exercise of power that it did have, and in any event, a failure to apply the applicable law,

in sum and excess of power.

The Applicants assert that the excess is manifest. First, a simple reading of the First Award,
the First Annulment Decision, the written submissions of the Parties and the transcript of
hearing reveals that the Resubmission Tribunal substituted the res iudicata parts of the
First Award with its own and disregarded the agreement of the Parties. That is “évident,
flagrant ou discernable sans effort.”**4 Second, the consequences of the excess of powers
are particularly serious. It has led the Resubmission Tribunal to deny the existence of injury
and damage and has thereby completely annihilated the effect and result of the First

Tribunal’s final and binding adjudication.*7

With respect to the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants
submit that the conduct, arguments and determination presented in the context of the
manifest excess of powers document at the same time a consistent bias and partiality in

favour of the Respondent.

Examples of bias and partiality are: (1) the wrong definition of the concept of
compensation, (2) the confusion between prejudice and quantum, (3) the rejection and
misinterpretation of evidence, (4) the distortion of the First Committee’s determination, (5)
the disregarding of the agreement of the Parties as to the nature of damage and
compensation. By these stratagems, the Resubmission Tribunal tried to wipe out the results
of the First Award, as far as it was in favour of the Applicants, has given a reduced and
caricatural description of the Applicants’ arguments and has followed the Respondents’

arguments fraudulently and in bad faith.*?°

With respect to a failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based, the Applicants

 

 

submit as follows.

The Applicants have detailed their arguments on damages in their written submissions,

through expert opinion, and through oral presentation before the Resubmission Tribunal.

In particular, they argued coherently that the damage caused by the violations of the fair
and equitable treatment standard was equivalent to the damage caused by the confiscation
of the shares of CPP and EPC in 1973-1975 and had to be calculated to establish the fair

market value at that moment.

Despite the res indicata acknowledgment of these damages by the First Tribunal, the
Resubmission Tribunal had only given a very superficial summary of these arguments in
paragraphs 70-74 of the Award, and set out in paragraph 196 of the Award that the
Applicants had pleaded “a full theory of damages.”*?’ This is “inconsistent with 232, which

suggests that they hadn’t even begun to outline such a theory.”*”

Further, by “distortion frauduleuse,”*”? the Resubmission Tribunal simply affirmed that
the Applicants had not met the burden to prove “what injury was caused to either or both
of them by the Respondent’s breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in the
BIT, and then of establishing the corresponding assessable damage in financial terms,” and

that “in some sense, they have not even tried to do so.”?°

In this way, “la Sentence de Resoumission, par la fagon dont elle a traité, ou plut6t refusé de
traiter la théorie des Demanderesses concernant la nature de leur préjudice et l’évaluation de
celui-ci, s’est donc rendue coupable tant d’un défaut de motifs que d’un excés de pouvoir
manifeste.”**! In fact, it is impossible to understand “le cheminement suivi par le tribunal
pour parvenir a sa conclusion.”**? It is, the Applicants assert, frivolous, grossly insufficient

and inadequate and must therefore be annulled for lack of reasons.**?

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent refutes the Applicants’ assertions on a manifest excess of powers, a
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and an absence of reasons on which

the Resubmission Award is based and asserts that the annulment request must be rejected.
The Respondent submits as follows.

At the outset, it notes that the Applicants have targeted a number of questions that the
Resubmission Tribunal asked during the hearing concerning their investments, the nature
of compensation, the status of Decree No. 165 and of Decision No. 43. The Applicants
argue that through these questions, the Tribunal re-opened the debate on issues already
decided res iudicata. Since only awards can be annulled and not questions, the Applicants’

arguments are inappropriate and must be rejected summarily.**+

In addition, the questions were pertinent, concerned issues that had been debated during
the proceeding and came as no surprise.*** The Applicants’ allegations that the Tribunal
demonstrated partiality and bias each time it sided with the Respondent is groundless, since
such allegation requires — as found by the Tulip v. Turkey ad hoc committee, introduced by
the Applicants — “clear and incontrovertible substantiation,” which the Applicants have

failed to provide.**°

In substance, the Resubmission Tribunal has not re-opened any issue that had become final
and binding after the First Committee’s Decision, and has respected the res iudicata

decisions of the First Tribunal.

With respect to the issues of the exact nature of the remaining investment after the
expropriation and of the acknowledgment of the relevance of facts, events, arguments and

evidence after the expropriation, the Resubmission Tribunal has accepted the First

Tribunal’s determination that the long delay in proceedings before Chilean courts,
continuing well after 1997, and the Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 constituted violations
of the Article 4 of the BIT, since the First Committee had found “that the duty to provide
redress for violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end,”>”
thereby upholding the First Tribunal’s finding as res iudicata, against the argumentation
of Chile. These facts bely the Applicants’ allegations that the Resubmission Tribunal
disrespected the First Tribunal’s findings on the Applicants’ investments, and that it
refused to take facts, events, arguments and evidence that occurred after 1997, into
consideration. In reality, the Tribunal rejected only such facts and evidence coming to pass

after the First Award.*38

Further, the Applicants’ allegations that the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its powers
by disrespecting the First Tribunal’s res iudicata findings on injury, causation and damages
are baseless: with respect to injury, the First Tribunal tried nowhere to “purport to identify
any injury at all — let alone an injury resulting specifically from the BIT violation that it

had found (which the First Tribunal expressly distinguished from an expropriatory act).”*°?

With respect to damages, the First Tribunal had stated that damages resulting from the
confiscation did not require any particular analysis*? and that for the alleged damages
caused by FET-standard violations the Applicants had failed to adduce any evidence.**!
This is the contrary of what the Applicants allege. As a result, the Resubmission Tribunal
cannot have exceeded its powers by non-respecting res iudicata findings of the First
Tribunal, first because the First Tribunal never made such findings, and second because
the parts of the First Award that do reveal the First Tribunal’s findings were annulled and

have no res iudicata effect.”

The Applicants’ allegation that the First Committee confirmed the First Tribunal’s findings

on injury and damages runs equally against its unequivocal statement:

Having reviewed the entire record, including the parties’

submissions, the Committee can only conclude that the by

parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from the

breaches of Article 4 of the BIT.*3
The Respondent further argues that the Applicants mischaracterize the Resubmission
Tribunal’s ascertainment on compensation in a vain effort to demonstrate that it exceeded

its powers and was biased by disregarding the First Tribunal’s res iudicata decision on

such compensation.

First, the Resubmission Tribunal explicitly recognized that the Applicants’ right to
compensation had been adjudicated as res iudicata in paragraph 3 of the First Award’s
dispositif. At the same time, it had understood that “what does remain open for re-litigation
at the instance of the Claimants is the nature of the compensation due to them under
paragraph 3 in consequence of the breach established in paragraph 2, following the

annulment of the assessment made by the First Tribunal in paragraph 4.”*44

These two elements of the First Award had to be interpreted “to evaluate what these
determinations meant in practical terms,” which is not — as a matter of principle — contested

by the Applicants.*4° In accomplishing this exercise:

[T]he Tribunal reads paragraph 3 as stating the entitlement
to reparation that necessarily follows from the determination
of the breach of an international obligation, but without
predetermining what form or nature that reparation must
take, except perhaps the non-explicit assumption that in the
normal case it may take the form of monetary damages. But
it does not read the paragraph as absolving a party claiming

480.

monetary damages from its normal obligation to prove such

damage, including its causation.*4°
As a result, the Resubmission Tribunal confirmed that the Applicants had a right to
compensation, as determined by the First Tribunal res iudicata, but that at the same time
they had a duty to prove what compensation was due as a consequence of the violation of
Article 4 of the BIT. The Applicants had ample opportunity to discharge this duty and
burden but chose not to do so. The Resubmission Tribunal could not but confirm this failure

and conclude that it “cannot therefore, on principle, make any award of damages.”*4”

The Resubmission Tribunal took care to remain within the framework of the First
Tribunal’s res iudicata determination and developed its line of reasoning without internal
contradictions by avoiding the repetition of the error of the First Tribunal to “select a

damages figure arbitrarily,” which had resulted in the partial annulment.**

Second, the Resubmission Tribunal has not substituted the term “compensation” by
“satisfaction.” Rather, after having interpreted the First Award, it noted en passant and in

349

addition to its principal conclusion””” that formal recognition of their status as victims of a

denial of justice “constitutes in itself a form of satisfaction under international law.”>”

THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW
dd) The Applicants’ Position

In paragraphs 253-264 of their Annulment Application and paragraphs 681-691 of their
Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants develop their argument that the Resubmission
Tribunal has failed to apply the applicable law, in particular the Chilean Constitution but

also Chilean court decisions, to appreciate that the confiscation had been invalid and

without legal effect and that it had not terminated the ownership of Mr. Pey. These

arguments have been dealt with in Section VILA. of this Decision.

481. In paragraphs 265-269 of their Annulment Application, the Applicants further submit that
the Resubmission Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law when rejecting their claim for

moral damages.

482. The Applicants refer to ICSID arbitration case law and also to doctrine to assert that it “est
incontestable que les tribunaux CIRDI ont compétence pour accorder des dommages

moraux.” >>!

483. Immediately thereafter, the Applicants assert that the categorical non-application of
Chilean law in the treatment of moral damages by the Tribunal is manifest, whereby it has

exceeded its powers.*>*

484. They arrive at this conclusion because, on the one hand, the Tribunal has not applied the
case law of the Chilean Supreme Court that has repeatedly determined that a person having
suffered moral damages is exempt from the burden of proving them,** and that on the
other hand, in international law, the power to grant compensation for moral damages does

not depend on a prior determination of material injury or damage.***

485. The latter argument, they assert, follows directly from the clear formulation in Article 31(2)
of the Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that “any damage, whether material

or moral,” must be compensated.*°°

The Applicants conclude from the foregoing that “/e paragraphe 243 de la Sentence dans

la procédure en annulation doit étre annulé pour exces de pouvoir manifeste.”**©

In paragraphs 270-275 of their Annulment Application, the Applicants submit that the
Resubmission Tribunal failed to consider their claim for the restitution of benefits, i.e. for
unjust enrichment, under international law, although they have introduced it into the

Resubmission Proceeding, as documented in paragraph 52 of the Resubmission Award.**”

This amounts to a non-application of the applicable law because “les Demanderesses
faisaient valoir L’enrichissement injuste en tant que doctrine générale du droit
international” and “[la] législation applicable selon lV’article 10(4) de l' API Espagne-Chili

inclut les principes du droit international.”?>*

The Tribunal was competent under international law to address the issue of permanent
violations of secondary obligations resulting from the breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard. It should have ordered the Respondent to disgorge the benefits drawn
from the use of the Applicants’ property. However, it misinterpreted the Applicants’

position in this respect:

Le manquement absolu a appliquer la législation applicable
dans ce contexte a amené le 2°" Tribunal a une
compréhension ou énonciation erronée, dans la section K de
sa Sentence, de la réclamation des Demanderesses comme
constituant une reformulation de la demande selon laquelle
la prétendue confiscation initiale était une violation du
traité, ce qu’avait été exclu par le Tribunal initial avec
l’autorité de la chose jugée, étant donné que l’acte en
question était hors du domaine temporel du traité.**?

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent has not developed a position with respect to the request for annulment of
paragraph 243 (on moral damages) and of Section K (on unjust enrichment) of the
Resubmission Award. It submits that the unjust enrichment claim “appears to have been

abandoned in the Annulment Memoria and in regard of the moral damages claims

“Claimants appear to have abandoned this claim as well.”3°7

THE DISMISSAL OF THE RESTITUTION CLAIM FOR DAMAGES SUFFERED DUE TO THE

DEFENSE OF THE INVESTMENT AND THE ACCESS TO ARBITRATION
(dd) The Applicants’ Position

In paragraphs 8-23 of their Reply on Annulment, dated 9 November 2018, the Applicants
introduced a request for annulment of the Resubmission Award, asserting that the

ResubmissionTribunal:
- seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d));7°? and
- failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based (Article 52(1)(e)),

when it did not explain why it has rejected the Applicants’ claim for “dommages
consécutifs a la défense de l'investissement et du droit a l’accés a l’arbitrage [devant le

cirbI,”>™ and when it failed to take the documentation of these damages into

The Committee understands this to be a clerical error.

consideration, “ce qui constitue un manquement a une répartition appropriée de la charge
de la preuve et une manifestation de partialité grave” by the Tribunal.*® They reiterate the
uncontroversial legal standard on the absence of reasons and the difference between an

appeal and annulment,*” as presented in Chapter VI of this Decision.

The Applicants submit that the request does not contain new grounds for annulment but
new reasons to support the grounds already asserted in the Annulment Application of 10
October 2017 and the Memorial on Annulment of 27 April 2018. They react to the
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on Annulment of 20 July 2018. This approach is
generally admitted in ICSID proceedings as summarised in Togo Electricité v. Togo, where
the Committee found that “/a Convention CIRDI n’empéche pas les parties de soulever de
nouveaux arguments a l’appui de leur demande en annulation a un stade ultérieur de la
procedure.”*"

The Applicants contend that they have incurred incidental costs of almost 12 million Euro
for actions between 1997 and 2013 to secure and enforce their claims caused by the
Respondent’s conduct during and after the initial proceeding and during the proceeding
before the First Committee, and that they have brought these claims before the
Resubmission Tribunal together with detailed and uncontested documentation, as

evidenced by paragraphs 120, 121 and 132 of the Award.*°

They submit that these costs must be reimbursed to guarantee restitutio in integrum, a
principle generally admitted in international law. They rely on a commentary on Article 36

of the Articles on State Responsibility, which states that it “is well established that

496. They document the Resubmission Tribunal’s line of reasoning*”! and assert that it amounts
to an absence of reasons, particularly in light of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention

which obliges tribunals to state the reasons on which they base their decision:

Il n’existe dans la SR aucune motivation appliquée a la
demande relative aux dommages consécutifs qui permettrait
de comprendre le raisonnement l’ayant porté a refuser, au

millions d’euros de dommages consécutifs que les
Demanderesses ont été forcées d’engager dans la défense de

novembre 1997, et celle de la fin de l’exécution forcée du
point 5 du Dispositif de la Sentence initiale, le 2 novembre
201537

497. As to the assertion of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the

Applicants write:

D’autre part, la SR a rejeté cette demande sans avoir en
aucune fagon pris en considération les piéces justificatives,
incontestées, du montant des dommages causés aux
Demanderesses, ce qui constitue un manquement a une
répartition appropriée de la charge de la preuve et une
manifestation de partialité grave de la part du TR
sanctionnée a Varticle 51(1)(d) la Convention”

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent refutes the Applicants’ arguments and request for procedural and
substantial reasons in paragraphs 115-122 of its Rejoinder on Annulment with the

following arguments.

First, it asserts that the First Tribunal and the First Annulment Committee made a final
determination on costs of the different procedural phases and that these decisions are res
iudicata.*™*

Second, the Applicants misrepresent the First Tribunal’s res iudicata determination when
they allege a violation of Article 3 of the BIT and Articles 53(1) and 54(1) of the ICSID

Convention. Neither the Committee nor the First Tribunal have found on such violations.*”>

Third, the Applicants’ request concern new claims. They were introduced more than two
years after the Award, a very long time after the 120 days, provided for in Article 52(2) of
the ICSID Convention.*”°

Fourth, it is inaccurate that the Resubmission Tribunal has not stated reasons for its
decision not to grant prior costs claims. It has stated that its role was limited and it was not
authorised to re-open res iudicata determinations such as the ones on costs, that in any
event the Tribunal had explicitly stated — in footnotes 355 and 358 — that the decision on
costs was not material to the Resubmission Proceeding and would not be re-considered,

and that it could not make any award on damages.°””

Fifth, it is obvious that the Tribunal lacked the authority to overturn the costs decision
already rendered by the First Tribunal and the First Committee, and tribunals are not held

“to explain self-evident truths.”*”* The Respondent relies on Professor Schreuer, who states

that an award “will not be annulled if the reasons for a decision, though not stated, are

readily apparent to the ad hoc committee.”>””

Sixth and in particular with regard to the allegation that there was a serious departure of a
fundamental rule of procedure, the Applicants presented only two totally insufficient
assertions, which do not refer to a procedural rule, let alone a fundamental one, which do
not demonstrate how the Tribunal departed from a rule, and which do not explain in what

way the alleged departure was serious.*°°

THE DECISION ON THE STATUS OF MS. CORAL PEY GREBE IN THE RESUBMISSION

PROCEEDING
dd) The Applicants’ Position

In paragraphs 698-753 of their Memorial on Annulment, dated 27 April 2018, paragraphs
234-253 of their Reply on Annulment, dated 9 November 2018 and during the hearing,**!
the Applicants presented the issue of the status of Ms. Pey Grebe in the proceeding. They
assert that the Resubmission Tribunal committed a series of annullable errors when it
decided that she had no ius standi as a party in interest although being an investor, and that

she was the representative of the Applicants instead.

They request, in paragraph 753 of the Memorial on Annulment, that the Committee annul
the first paragraph of the dispositif and paragraphs 187-188 of the Resubmission Award
for manifest excess of powers. They also request, in paragraph 250 of the Reply on
Annulment, the annulment on the basis of the additional grounds of a serious departure

from a fundamental rule of procedure and an absence of reasons. Furthermore, they

request, in paragraph 251 of the Reply on Annulment, that the Committee annul the whole

Award for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (partiality).

They recall that Mr. Pey Casado remains a party to the proceeding being represented by
his counsel Dr. Garcés and that it is an excess of powers and a failure to state reasons to
replace Dr. Garcés and impose Ms. Pey Grebe as new counsel against the will of all parties

involved.**

They further recall that Mr. Pey Casado had assigned his “actions, titres, droits et
créances” by notarial deed of 15 March 2013 to his daughter Ms. Pey Grebe and that she
substituted her father in the ongoing ICSID proceeding by agreeing in the deed that “elle
se subroge au lieu et place du CEDANT pour ce qui concerne dudit arbitrage auprés du
CIRDI [...] conformément a ce que dispose l'article cinquante-deux (six) de la Convention

CIRDI."**3

Therefore, she had become an investor in CPP S.A. in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention, not differently from the Co-Applicant Foundation President Allende,*** to

whom Mr. Pey Casado had assigned part of his shares on 27 April 1990.38

In her quality as assignee, she had become a successor and a party to the proceeding, again
no different from the Co-Applicant Foundation President Allende, given that the
assignment was valid without government approval, that she had double nationality, like
her father, and that the issue of nationality was finally settled with the registration of the

original proceeding.**° The Applicants rely on Professor Hanotiau who states that

“Tp]ersons others than formal signatories may be parties to the arbitration agreement [...]

512. The First Tribunal recognised formally and with res iudicata effect that Mr. Pey Casado
has ius standi before the ICSID tribunal as an investor and owner, as confirmed by the First
Committee, and that this recognition applies to Ms. Pey Grebe as his successor, as much
so as the res iudicata determination on the ius standi of the Foundation and on the

nationality of Mr. Pey Casado apply mutatis mutandis to her.?**

513. Under these circumstances of established facts and law, the Resubmission Tribunal

manifestly exceeded its powers:

- when it denied Ms. Pey Grebe her status as investor, successor and thereby her quality

as a party of the proceeding, in identity with her predecessor;**?
- when it re-opened the issue of her nationality;*”°

- when it disrespected the First Tribunal’s final determination of the quality of the

Foundation as investor and did not apply it to her;*?!

- when it refused to recognize the identity of the Parties to the initial proceedings thus

excluding Ms. Pey Grebe from accessing international arbitration and leaving her in a

Tribunal that “the transfer would not have been such as to satisfy the normal

requirement of an identity of parties”;*?°

- when it contradicted itself by denying financial compensation and at the same time
speculating about internal arrangements between Mr. Pey Casado and Ms. Pey Grebe

with regard to such potential compensation;*”° and

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent refutes the Applicants’ arguments on procedural and substantive grounds.

It presents the following arguments.

First, the Applicants missed the deadline of 120 days for the introduction of a new
annulment claim, as established in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID

Arbitration Rule 51(1)(c), without an excuse.*?

Second, the Applicants failed to substantiate in what way an alleged excess of powers was
obvious and serious, what fundamental procedural rule the Tribunal departed from, and in
what way the alleged departure was serious, and how reasons were lacking or

contradictory.*°

Third, the Applicants try to establish that the Tribunal was wrong in its determination,

which amounts to an inadmissible appeal of the Award.*°!

Fourth, the Tribunal’s conclusions and reasoning as to the status of the Claimants of the
dispute and the inadmissibility of admitting a new claimant are convincing, in line with
Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which requires the identity of the parties throughout
the proceeding, and in any event “tenable.” Further, the Tribunal stated the reasons on
which it has based its decision. The fact that the reasoning was succinct does not deprive
it of its existence.*”* Further, the reasoning on the internal distribution of a hypothetical
compensation did not contradict the Tribunal’s final rejection of financial compensation,

since the Tribunal exposed its thoughts clearly in the conditional.*

Fifth, the Applicants misrepresent the Tribunal’s finding on the status of Ms. Pey Grebe as

representative of Mr. Pey Casado. The Tribunal never stated that it would consider her to

be new counsel in the proceeding and continued to address Dr. Garcés as such but tried to

THE FINDING ON COSTS IN THE RECTIFICATION DECISION
dd) The Applicants’ Position

In paragraphs 276-280 of the Annulment Application and in paragraphs 754-757 of the
Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants request the annulment of paragraphs 58, 61 and
62(b) of the Decision on Rectification of the Award, dated 6 October 2017. The request to
also annul paragraph 7 of the dispositif of the Resubmission Award,*°> was withdrawn

during the hearing.*°°

The Applicants submit that the Tribunal condemned them to pay the totality of the costs of
the rectification proceeding, although they only lost the requests for the disqualification of
arbitrators but had successfully challenged the errors in the Award, which the Tribunal was

obliged to recognize and correct.*°”

The Tribunal’s decision on the allocation of costs contradicts arbitral practice, where
success in a dispute is normally taken into account by tribunals in their decisions to allocate
costs including by one in which arbitrator Veeder sat and in which he had decided to split
the costs after an equilibrated rectification decision.‘ It also contradicts the Tribunal’s

own determination in paragraphs 249-251 of the Resubmission Award.*”

The Applicants allege a “partialité évidente [...] et le caractére arbitraire” of the Tribunal
and ask the Committee that it annuls “dans sa totalité les §§58, 61 et 62(b) de la Décision

du 6 octobre 2017, pour les motifs établis a Varticle 52(1) de la Convention, lettres (b), (d)

et (e).”*!° In paragraph 757 of the Memorial on Annulment, the Applicants also allege an
“inobservance grave d’une régle fondamentale de procédure, un excés de pouvoir

manifeste et absence de motif.”4!!

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the Applicants have not articulated any of the grounds for
annulment “in sufficient detail to be intelligible” and failed to address their various

elements.‘!?

Further, the fact that one member of the Tribunal was arbitrator in a different proceeding

where the tribunal had come to a different result is irrelevant for the present case.*!?

The Respondent alleges that it is not true that the Applicants prevailed in their rectification
requests. Indeed, “Chile had in fact agreed that certain rectifications were needed” and

made proposals in that sense that were accepted by the Tribunal with one exception.*!

Finally, it submits that the Applicants had used a “vexatious litigation strategy during the
Rectification Proceeding” and had abused it as a vehicle to challenge arbitrators Sir Berman
and Mr. Veeder. This approach hindered an efficient and economical conduct of the
proceeding. It was appropriate that under the circumstances the Tribunal decided to order

the Applicants to pay the totality of the costs.4!°

THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS ON THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT

THE APPOINTMENT OF MR. ALEXIS MOURRE AND THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S

APPROACH TO THE APPLICANTS’ REQUESTS FOR HIS REMOVAL

The Applicants formulated their objections to the constitution of the Resubmission
Tribunal with respect to Mr. Mourre when the Secretariat invited the Parties to appoint
arbitrators. Therefore, their objections were timely, and this timeliness extends to the
initiation of the present annulment proceeding, which was only possible after the rendering
of the Resubmission Award. However, this request for annulment must be rejected for the

following reasons.
dd) Improper constitution of the tribunal

Consent and the autonomy of the parties are essential elements of the ICSID system. Parties
are in control of the proceedings. One of the fundamental expressions of autonomy relates
to the constitution of tribunals. The autonomy is exercised by either agreeing on the method
of appointment of arbitrators or by appointing one of them individually, as laid down in
Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Since the right is fundamental, the ICSID

Convention provides only for default mechanisms under specific circumstances.

These general considerations apply also for resubmission proceedings, as reflected in

Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d).

Article 52(6) provides that “the dispute shall [...] be submitted to a new tribunal [...].” The
terms are unambiguous. As the Applicants rightly point out, when an award is annulled, it
is no longer final and the proceeding starts afresh. The dispute continues but the proceeding
is in the hands of a new adjudicating body. The resubmission tribunal has no link to the
previous adjudicating body and is not a successor. Therefore, the Applicants are not correct
when they assume that the newly appointed arbitrators “take the place” of the arbitrators

of preceding phases of the dispute.

136

534.

535.

536.

537.

538.

Article 52(6) further provides that the new tribunal shall be “constituted in accordance with
Section 2” of Chapter IV, in other words with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.
Whenever the drafters of the ICSID Convention refer to other provisions and their mutatis
mutandis application, they do it with precision, as is the case in Article 52(4) of the ICSID
Convention. The Committee has no doubt that the reference to Articles 37 to 40 is meant

to exclude the applicability of other Articles for the constitution of the new tribunal.

In particular, the reference to Section 2 of Chapter [TV unambiguously excludes a reference

to Chapter V and more specifically to the powers of the Chairman pursuant to Article 56(3).

That does not mean that Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention is inapplicable in
resubmission proceedings. It would be applicable if and to the extent that its requirements
are met. If one of the arbitrators resigns in the course of resubmission proceedings, the
Chairman has the duty to appoint a replacement. In the present case, however, the situation
is the opposite: the arbitrator whom the Applicants seek to replace through appointment of

the Chairman explicitly declared that he did not wish to resign.

In addition, Article 56(3) on its own terms also precludes its application to the constitution
of a resubmission tribunal as a mere consequence of the fact that the Article was applied
to the first tribunal. Article 56(3) provides that if an arbitrator appointed by a party “shall
have resigned without the consent of the Tribunal of which he was a member,” the
Chairman shall appoint a person from the Panel “to fill the resulting vacancy.” These terms

clearly limit the scope of application to the recomposition of the same tribunal.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) implements Article 52(6). Pursuant to that provision, the
Secretariat shall “invite the parties to proceed [...] to constitute a new Tribunal, including
the same number of arbitrators, and appointed by the same method, as the original one.”
Again, since the new tribunal is not a continuation of the old one, the method to be used to
constitute the resubmission tribunal is the method used to constitute the first tribunal.
ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) cannot provide differently given the clear terms of Article
52(6) of the ICSID Convention which it implements.

137

539.

S41.

542.

543.

The Applicants assert that the reference to the “original one” (“Tribunal initial” in French)
in ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) does not point to the tribunal as originally constituted
but rather to the one that rendered the award. According to the Applicants, this
interpretation is necessary to give effect to the applicability of Article 56(3), a crucial norm
for the propriety of arbitral proceedings and the continuous sanction of improper conduct

of one party.

However, contrary to what the Applicants assert, the terms “original,” “initial” and
“tribunal which rendered the award” are not used interchangeably in the ICSID Convention
and the Rules. It is true that the same formula, “the original one.” is used in both ICSID
Arbitration Rule 51(3) for interpretation and revision, and in ICSID Arbitration Rule
55(2)(d) for annulment proceedings. However, this argument finds no basis in the
Convention, which prevails over the Rules. On the two occasions when the Convention
refers to the “tribunal which has rendered the award,” i.e. in Article 50(2) for interpretation
and in Article 51(3) for revision, it does so because that very tribunal is most familiar with
the award and therefore most competent to interpret it or to determine whether subsequent
unknown facts were discovered warranting a revision. This is substantially different from

resubmission proceedings where a case must, in whole or in part, be decided anew.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d) also requires the Secretariat to “invite the parties to
proceed [...] to constitute a new Tribunal” and not “the parties or the Chairman, if he
appointed one of the members of the first tribunal pursuant to Article 56(3) of the
Convention” — which would have been the appropriate formula further to the Applicants’

position.

The Committee agrees with the Applicants that Article 56(3) has an important function for
the efficiency and the propriety of the proceeding. There are, however, several reasons why
this function could not be activated by an “analogous application” for the purpose of the

constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal.

First, the Applicants’ thesis is contradicted by the clear and self-sufficient terms of both

Articles 52(6) and 56(3) that leave no room for an “analogous application.”

138

544. Second, the Applicants’ thesis finds no support in the context, or in the object and purpose

of the relevant provisions.

545. The object and purpose of Article 52(6) is to provide for the constitution of a new tribunal.
Under the ICSID Convention, the principle is that the constitution of arbitral tribunals is in
the hands of the parties, in accordance with the principle of autonomy (Article 37 of the
ICSID Convention). The appointment of arbitrators by the Chairman is the default rule
(Article 38 of the ICSID Convention). Accordingly, the object and purpose of Article 52(6)

and its context contradict the Applicants’ thesis.

546. The same is true of the object and purpose of Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention
together with its context. When it comes to constituting a resubmission tribunal, the
functions and purposes of Article 56(3) are either not at issue or achieved through other

416

means. According to the sources relied upon by the Applicants,*"® such functions are

threefold:

- A first function of Article 56(3) is to safeguard the immutability of the composition of
tribunals. This function is not at issue since the resubmission tribunal is constituted
anew and by definition, none of its members have resigned without the other

arbitrators’ consent.

- A second possible function of Article 56(3) is to prevent a party, in the course of the
proceedings, from inducing the arbitrator which it appointed to resign so as to replace
her or him with “a more tractable” one. This function is not at issue either when it
comes to the constitution of a resubmission tribunal. There is no basis for a party to be
dissatisfied with the performance of its party-appointed arbitrator and try to have her
or him removed before the resubmission proceedings even started. At that initial stage,

each party seeks to make the best appointment, and each arbitrator declares that she or

the Secretariat.

139

547.

548.

549.

he is independent and impartial. Each arbitrator is presumed to be so unless she or he

is challenged pursuant to the relevant provisions.

- A third function of Article 56(3) consists in preventing a party from delaying
proceedings by causing the arbirator it appointed to resign and then postponing the
appointment of a replacement arbitrator. Where the constitution of a resubmission
tribunal is at stake, this function is achieved through other means. If a party fails to
appoint an arbitrator within 90 days, the power to appoint in lieu of that party rests with
the Chairman pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention upon the request of one

of the parties.

In conclusion, the provisions dealing with the constitution of the resubmission tribunal in
the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules are straightforward, consistent,
coherent and complete. The Committee does not see a gap which might justify an
analogous application of the basic idea of a norm which is not applicable through
interpretation in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT. The non-application of Article
56(3) does not lead to a situation where the interpretation, pursuant to Article 31 of the
VCLT, leaves the meaning of Articles 52(6) and 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention
“ambiguous or obscure” or leading to “manifestly absurd or unreasonable” results (Article

32 of the VCLT).

In addition, in the first phase of the present proceeding, the Chairman had appointed a
specific arbitrator to replace another specific arbitrator. Nothing in this decision indicates
that — assuming this is within the powers of the Chairman — it was meant to pronounce a
sanction against Chile for wrongdoings in connection with its party-appointed arbitrator’ s
divulgation of the First Tribunal’s deliberation,*!” and that the Chairman sought to establish

his power to appoint arbitrators instead of Chile for the remainder of the proceeding.

It may be added that the fears which, according to the Applicants’ thesis, would justify an

“analogical application” of Article 52(6) did not materialize. Chile did not seek to delay

417 Supra, para. 306.

140

550.

551.

552.

553.

the proceedings by postponing the appointment of an arbitrator, quite the opposite. The
appointment of Mr. Mourre was made promptly, and in appointing Mr. Mourre, Chile did
not choose an arbitrator “more tractable” than other arbitrators before him, since the
Applicants expressly confirmed that the personal qualities of Mr. Mourre were not in

question and that they had no reason to challenge him.

For these reasons, the Committee determines that the appointment of Mr. Mourre by Chile
complied with Articles 52(6) and 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and the constitution
of the Tribunal was proper. The Applicants’ request for annulment based on Article

52(1)(a) with respect to Mr. Mourre is therefore rejected.

The determination on the proper constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal is not without
effect on the other alleged grounds for annulment, i.e., a manifest excess of power and a
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, allegedly exercised by the Tribunal

but also by the Centre.
(2) Manifest excess of power

The Committee understands that the Applicants are asserting that the Centre and the
Resubmission Tribunal have exceeded their powers, first by disrespecting the binding

conclusions of the First Tribunal, and second by accepting the appointment of Mr. Mourre.

The Committee has studied the First Award carefully. It has not found a binding decision
or even a statement to the effect that in potential resubmission phases, Chile would be
precluded from appointing an arbitrator. Paragraphs 34-37 and 729 describe violations of
the deontological duties of individual arbitrators and incidents which are incompatible with
the practice of international arbitration but they do not envisage procedural steps in future
phases of the dispute. The First Tribunal found that the resigning arbitrator had violated
his deontological duties but considered that it was not within its power to inquire whether
Chile had taken any initiative in this sense.‘!® Therefore, the Centre did not violate a res

iudicata effect when it monitored the procedure of constitution of the Resubmission

418 First Award, paras. 36-37.

141

554.

555.

556.

557.

Tribunal in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d), and the Resubmission
Tribunal did not violate such effect by accepting its constitution of that Tribunal in

accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

Further, neither the Centre nor the Resubmission Tribunal violated Article 41(1) of the
ICSID Convention when the Resubmission Tribunal held, during the controversial debates
surrounding the drafting of Procedural Order No. 1 in 2013/2014, that it was properly
constituted and competent to adjudicate the matters before it. The Resubmission Tribunal
did what Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention requests it to do, namely it ruled on its
competence to decide on the Claimants’ request regarding the role of Mr. Mourre in the

Resubmission Tribunal.

Finally, neither the Centre nor the Resubmission Tribunal violated the duty established in
Article 44 of the ICSID Convention. A violation of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention
would require that a gap in procedural rules existed which had to be filled by the Tribunal’s
decision. However, no such gap exists in situations where an arbitrator is appointed in
accordance with the procedural rules. There was no legal basis for the two other arbitrators
to ask Mr. Mourre to resign, and there was no legal basis to ask the Chairman to appoint
an arbitrator. Accordingly, the Centre acted in compliance with the ICSID Convention and
the Arbitration Rules when monitoring the constitution of the Resubmission Tribunal in

accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d).

Therefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ request to annul the Resubmission Award

for an excess of power in the context of the appointment of Mr. Mourre.
(3) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure

With respect to an alleged departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, neither the
Resubmission Tribunal — nor indeed the Centre — violated a rule of procedure by refusing
to take action, at the request of the Applicants, to invite Mr. Mourre to resign, holding that
it was not called to do so without a formal request for disqualification which the Applicants

refused to submit.

142

558.

559.

560.

Members of tribunals have no authority to take action against a co-arbitrator sua sponte.
An initiation by one of the parties is required. The Committee does not subscribe to the
Applicants’ argument according to which a request for disqualification under Article 57 of
the ICSID Convention was “inapplicable” since their refusal to accept the appointment of
Mr. Mourre was not based on any of his personal qualities. As the Respondent observes,
Article 57 of the ICSID Convention not only allows for the examination of an arbitrator’s
personal qualities but also allows for the determination of whether the arbitrator was
“eligible for appointment” pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention. While
these Articles do not comprise the hypothesis envisaged by the Applicants, this is inherent
in the fact that they were seeking an analogous application of provisions of the ICSID
Convention. It was for the Applicants to act in a coherent manner on the basis of their
position as to an analogous application of Article 56(3). Accordingly, it was for the
Applicants to challenge Mr. Mourre by means of an application to disqualify him on the
basis of the (analogous) application of Article 57. Absent any such request, the
Resubmission Tribunal was not in a position to act. The Centre was in even less of a

position to act.

Therefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ request to annul the Resubmission Award
for a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure in the context of the appointment of Mr.

Mourre.

That leads to the overall result that all requests for annulment in the context of the

appointment of Mr. Mourre as arbitrator of the Resubmission Tribunal are rejected.

THE CHALLENGES TO SIR FRANKLIN BERMAN AND MR. V.V. VEEDER; THEIR ALLEGED
MANIFEST LACK OF IMPARTIALITY; THEIR ALLEGED FAILURE TO DISCLOSE
INFORMATION, INVESTIGATE RELEVANT FACTS AND ORDER THE PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS TO CHILE; THEIR ALLEGED CONDUCT FOLLOWING THE SECOND

CHALLENGE
dd) General observations: the Committee’s powers

This ad hoc Committee has the authority and duty to determine, (i) whether the
Resubmission Tribunal was properly constituted, (ii) whether, once constituted, it
manifestly exceeded its powers and/or seriously departed from a fundamental rule of
procedure and, (iii) whether the Resubmission Tribunal stated the reasons on which it based
the Resubmission Award. Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention unambiguously states
that a party may only request the annulment of an “award.” A rectification decision is no

exception and is annullable because it is “part of the award” (Article 49(2)).

This Committee does not have the authority and duty to assess the Resubmission Tribunal’s
conduct to the extent that it has not had an impact on the Resubmission Award. That is the
case for post-Award conduct, as long as such conduct does not evidence errors of the pre-

Award phase, reflecting a pattern or modus operandi of continuous behaviour.

The Committee does also not have the authority and duty to assess whether decisions or
opinions by individual arbitrators, expressed in letters or otherwise, state the reasons on
which they are based. Article 52(1)(e) unequivocally states that an award can only be
annulled when the tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the award is based. It does
not allow for the annulment of an award because the tribunal or a member of the tribunal
did not state the reasons on which procedural decisions outside the award, and even more

so post-award procedural decisions are based.

Further, ad hoc committees cannot, in principle, address the independence and impartiality
of an arbitrator de novo in disregard of the proceedings that have taken place pursuant to

Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention. They may only address the issue de novo if

144

565.

the decision taken pursuant to Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention was so plainly
unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have reached it. This is the approach
taken in EDF v. Argentina and Suez v. Argentina.""? The same position was taken by the
ad hoc committee in Mobil v. Argentina.°® As the Respondent argues, the Mobil
committee expressly adhered to the two abovementioned decisions.‘?! While the
Applicants correctly observe that the Mobil decision recognized further powers of

422 this was to the effect that annulment committees can evaluate an

annulment committees,
arbitral tribunal’s impartiality on the basis of the decisions taken by the tribunal (or by the
majority of the arbitrators) regarding a challenge brought against one of them.*?? The
Committee agrees with the Mobil committee in this respect and will proceed accordingly,
but observes that this is not concerned with the circumstances under which an annulment
committee can address de novo a challenge decided upon by the Chairman, rather than by

the remaining arbitrators.

For these reasons, a first series of acts which the Committee will not analyse from the

perspective of their possible annulment, is the following:

- the Tribunal’s decision of 21 November 2016 to reject a request for disclosure of

documents;

- President Berman’s letter of 1 March 2017 announcing his intention not to participate

in Mr. Veeder’s disqualification procedure; and

- the Tribunal’s decision of 15 June 2017 not to order Chile to provide information on

its relation with Essex Court Chambers.

568.

569.

These acts are not annullable per se. However, they will be analysed by the Committee so
as to determine whether their possible deficiencies impact on the Resubmission Award so

as to justify its annulment.

A second series of acts which the Committee will not analyse from the perspective of their
possible annulment consists of the two decisions of the Chairman of the Administrative
Council on the proposals to disqualify Sir Franklin Berman and Mr. Veeder, dated 21
February 2017 and 13 April 2017. This Committee will analyse only the decisions of the
Chairman so as to determine whether they hinder or, to the contrary, call for a de novo

examination of whether the Tribunal was properly constituted.
(2) President Berman’s letter of 1 March 2017: no pattern of pre-award conduct

In that context, the Committee wishes to underline the following point from the outset. It
does not consider that President Berman’s position, expressed in his letter of 1 March 2017,

evidences a pattern of pre-award conduct on his part.

With respect to the letter of 1 March 2017, the Applicants note that President Berman
referred the challenge against Mr. Veeder to the Chairman of the Administrative Council
because he regarded the challenge as an “appeal” against the Chairman’s previous decision
on the challenge brought against Mr. Veeder and himself. The Applicants assert that
President Berman thereby disregarded the fact that the new challenge was based on new

evidence, which allegedly proves a lack of impartiality on his part.

The Committee does not consider that President Berman’s letter of 1 March 2017 proves a
lack of impartiality. Qualifying the new challenge against Mr. Veeder as “not dissimilar to
an appeal,” as President Berman did, may not have been entirely adequate. However, since
a first challenge against Mr. Veeder had been decided upon by the Chairman, and since the
Applicants (as they themselves underline) were now alleging new facts, which were related
to the facts previously submitted to the Chairman, the nature of the new challenge was a
request for the revision of the Chairman’s previous decision. Requests for revision are

generally handled by the entity that rendered the original decision subject to which revision

146

570.

S71.

572.

is sought, as evidenced by Article 51 of the ICSID Convention. Against this background,
President Berman’s position does not constitute a refusal to admit that the Applicants were
adducing new evidence. It cannot be qualified as unreasonable or interpreted as evidencing

a lack of impartiality to the detriment of the Applicants.

President Berman’s further comment that if he were to sit on the new challenge against Mr.
Veeder, he would be open to the accusation that he (President Berman) lacked the
necessary impartiality because he had just been challenged by the Applicants or because
both the previous and the new challenge were concerned with the relationship between
members of the same barristers’ chambers, obviously sought to safeguard the integrity of
the proceedings and more specifically the Applicants’ rights and interests in that respect.
This behaviour is the opposite of behaviour evidencing partiality to the detriment of the

Applicants.

(3) The Tribunal’s decisions of 21 November 2016 and 15 June 2017: no pre-

award knowledge of the allegedly relevant facts

With respect to the refusal to investigate the relationship between Essex Court Chambers
and Chile, President Berman and Mr. Veeder, and, for that matter, the Applicants
themselves, declared that before the date of the Resubmission Award they did not know
that members of Essex Court Chambers had worked as counsel for and against Chile and
had been paid for these services. The Applicants allege that President Berman and Mr.
Veeder were not truthful in this respect and Chile alleges that it is the Applicants that were

not truthful in this respect.

Neither Party has proffered evidence for these allegations. The Committee has no reason
to doubt the sincerity of the affirmations of President Berman, Mr. Veeder and the
Applicants. It bases the reasoning of this Decision on Annulment on the assumption that
none of them lied and none of them had knowledge about the relations between other
members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile. The Committee further notes that neither
the relations nor the fees paid by Chile were contested when the issue was raised after the

Award had been rendered.

147

573.

574.

575.

576.

This observation leads to an unavoidable conclusion, similar to the one made in Vivendi IT
under comparable circumstances. That ad hoc committee found that the challenged
arbitrator had no actual knowledge of circumstances which might have caused a party to
doubt about the “reliability for independent judgment” (Article 14 of the ICSID
Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 6). Therefore, the incriminated circumstances

“had no material effect on the final decision of the Tribunal.”*”4

Since neither President Berman nor Mr. Veeder had positive knowledge of relations
between members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile at the time the Award was rendered,
that knowledge could not impair their judgment with respect to the Award. Later
knowledge does not reflect back to the time before the Award. It is therefore irrelevant
whether the knowledge had any impact on the incriminated decisions of 21 November 2106
and 15 June 2017. The Convention is only concerned with the absence of bias affecting

awards as the outcome of the arbitration process and not with subsequent conduct.
(4) The institutional propriety of the Chairman’s Decision of 13 April 2017

The Applicants assert that the Decision of 13 April 2017 by which the Chairman rejected
the proposal to disqualify Mr. Veeder was made by the wrong body. Therefore, the
Decision must be disregarded and the Committee must adjudicate the issue of

disqualification anew.

More precisely, the Applicants assert that President Berman had no right to refuse to decide
on the proposal, together with the second arbitrator, in accordance with Article 57 of the
ICSID Convention. They rely on Azurix v. Argentina where the ad hoc committee had

found:

Thus, for instance, a ground of annulment might exist under
Article 52(1)(a) [...] if a decision on a proposal for

4 Vivendi v. Argentina (II), Decision on the Argentine Republic’s Request for Annulment of the Award Rendered on
20 August 2017, 10 August 2010, para. 235 (C-107).

148

577.

578.

579.

580.

disqualification was purportedly taken by a person or body

other than the person or body prescribed by Article 58.4>
However, as already mentioned, the Applicants’ new challenge against Mr. Veeder was in
fact a request for revision of the Chairman’s previous decision on the challenge brought
against President Berman and Mr. Veeder. In accordance with a general principle of
procedural law, as evidenced by Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, requests for revision
should, if possible, be brought before the organ which rendered the original decision. As a
consequence, there is no basis to consider that the decision on the new challenge against

Mr. Veeder was made by a person or body lacking the necessary authority.

Another consequence is that the Applicants’ assertion that the decision-making process
violated the principle of the international ordre public that “un arbitre [ne peut] s’abstenir
dans l’accomplissement de l’obligation que la premiere phase de l’article 58 lui impose
tout en demeurant en fonction””® is of no avail. The question is whether the Chairman was
authorised to make the Decision and not whether President Berman was under the
obligation to decide the challenge in the circumstances of the case. That is not an issue of

ordre public but of the mechanics of the ICSID system.

In addition, the Applicants’ argument that President Berman should have either heard the
challenge against Mr. Veeder or resigned is not consistent with the solution that the ICSID
system provides, as President Berman declined to hear the challenge. From this
perspective, the issue before this Committee is not to decide whether President Berman
was entitled to refuse to participate in the procedure but rather whether the Chairman acted

correctly when he decided in the arbitrators’ stead.

Article 58 of the ICSID Convention does not specifically address the situation when one
of the remaining arbitrators declines (or for that matter, both arbitrators decline) to take
part in the challenge procedure. However, Article 58 addresses a series of hypotheses

where the decision shall be made by the Chairman, namely “where those [remaining]

5 Azurix v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/OI/12 (“Azurix v. Argentina”), Decision on the Application for
Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 1 September 2009, para. 282 (C-69).

+26 Annulment Application, para. 172.

149

581.

582.

583.

members are equally divided, or in the case of a proposal to disqualify a sole [...] arbitrator,
or a majority of [...] arbitrators.” These hypotheses taken together make it clear that when
the decision cannot be made by consensus between the two remaining arbitrators, it is for
the Chairman to decide. This solution is also bound to apply where one or both of the
remaining arbitrators, decline to make a decision. This has the consequence that the
remaining arbitrators do not reach a consensual decision either in favour or against the
challenge, which according to the terms of Article 58 triggers the Chairman’s decision-

making power.

The Committee agrees with the ad hoc committee in EDF v. Argentina that through Article
58 of the ICSID Convention the “machinery” for a challenge was put in place to allow
“swift” solutions.*?’ The provision breathes fair and rational procedural economy and the
intention to limit the loss of time and the possibility of obstruction to a minimum, as
specified in ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. Even assuming that the abstention of President
Berman to decide were unjustified, a swift and procedurally economical solution was called
for, which for the reasons set out above clearly consisted in having the decision made by

the Chairman.
(5) The Chairman’s Decisions of 21 February and 13 April 2017

The Committee also has to determine whether the Decisions of 21 February 2017 and
13 April 2017, rejecting the proposal to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder are

tenable and reasonable.

In turning to this exercise, the Committee agrees, as already mentioned, with the majority
view of ad hoc committees which have found that decisions of remaining arbitrators or the
Chairman on the disqualification of an arbitrator must be upheld unless they are “so plainly
unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.”478
This position strikes a fair balance between considerations of procedural economy and

integrity which are both central for the ICSID Convention. The procedural system of

27 EDF y. Argentina, Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016, para. 115 (C-103).

585.

challenges, as provided for in Articles 57 and 58, is mostly concerned with efficiency and
procedural economy and promotes the finality of decisions, while the procedural system of
annulment is mostly concerned with the propriety and integrity of the system and
establishes the “ad hoc committee as the guardian of the integrity of the arbitral
procedure.”“?? The Committee agrees with Suez v. Argentina, where the ad hoc committee

found that:

[A] scope of review wide enough to safeguard the integrity

of the proceedings but not so wide as to re-consider the

merits of a decision that was already taken in the underlying

proceedings is in line with the object and purpose of the

annulment proceeding within the regime of the ICSID

Convention and thus also in line with the interpretation

principles of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.**°
In maintaining this balance, the Committee does not venture into the field of an appeal
proceeding, which would violate the principle of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. It
understands the apprehension of the ad hoc committee in Azurix v. Argentina that refused
to decide whether “a decision under Article 58 was correct, as this would be tantamount to
an appeal.”“*! When examining whether the Chairman of the Administrative Council
rendered decisions that no reasonable decision-maker would have rendered, the issue is not
the correctness of the decisions but rather the protection of the basic integrity of the
challenge procedure. The legitimate apprehension to avoid a test equivalent to an appeal
must not engender the curtailing of committees’ functions to a degree that would prevent

the supervision of the integrity of the ICSID system.

On 21 February 2017, the Chairman rendered a decision which rejected the proposal to

disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder on procedural grounds. He found that the

proposal was not made “promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared
closed” as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1). Since the Chairman had refused the
proposal on procedural grounds, he did not make a determination as to the merits of the
Applicants’ assertions that the two arbitrators lacked the capacity to exercise independent

judgment.

The Committee notes that the Chairman interpreted and applied the term “promptly” in

appreciating the factual circumstances and the legal requirements.

He recalls in his decision that:

- during the appointment process, both President Berman and Mr. Veeder had disclosed

that they were members of Essex Court Chambers;

- the Applicants appointed Mr. Veeder after having agreed to the presidency of Sir
Franklin Berman, thereby implying that the fact that more than one member of Essex
Court Chambers served on the Tribunal did not arouse any suspicion as to their

independence and neutrality;

- both President Berman and Mr. Veeder had declared that they had no knowledge of the

relations between other members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile;

- the Applicants requested the disqualification of President Berman and Mr. Veeder
shortly after the Resubmission Award was rendered, when the Tribunal had ceased to
exist but was reconvened to decide upon a request for rectification in accordance with
Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. More specifically, the Applicants state that they
discovered the alleged conflict of interest on 20 September 2016. They submitted the
matter to the Secretary General on 18 October 2016, whereupon the Centre replied that
the Resubmission Tribunal had ceased to exist, whereafter the Applicants filed a

request for correction on 7 November 2016 and requested that Messrs. Berman and

152

588.

589.

590.

Veeder make full disclosures of their chambers’ relationship with Chile on 10

November, and finally requested their disqualification; and

- that the Chilean press had regularly reported (including during the period of the
Resubmission Proceeding) about the involvement of members of Essex Court
Chambers in Chilean disputes before international adjudication fora, that the
Applicants regularly introduced newspaper articles into the evidentiary record of the
case, and that the Applicants based their inquiry into the involvement of members of
Essex Court Chambers on an article in the Chilean press that was published a few days

after the Resubmission Award of 13 September 2016.

These elements must be taken into consideration when determining whether no reasonable
decision-maker would have possibly reached the decision to apply ICSID Arbitration

1,43 and whether no

Rule 9 as done by the Chairman of the Administrative Counci
reasonable decision-maker would have possibly rejected the Applicants’ proposal to

disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder for lack of timeliness.

The Committee recalls that, with respect to timeliness, the issue before the Committee and
already before the Chairman was not to determine whether the members of the
Resubmission Tribunal should have made inquiries into these relations and had failed to
do so but to determine whether the Applicants should have known that the arbitrators might

not have fulfilled their duties.

The Committee is aware that not all of the press clippings that the Chairman considered
were shared with the Applicants. It believes that this was a procedural error which should
not have occurred. However, this omission concerns only a few articles and was not result-
determinative. The substance of the press clippings referred to are in footnote 69 at
paragraph 88 of the decision where the Chairman reasons that the file, and notably press

clippings submitted by the Respondent, evidence that it was public knowledge since

December 2012 that Chile was assisted in international proceedings by members of Essex
Court Chambers. The Chairman then reasons, at paragraph 91, that the Applicants made a
regular use of press clippings, which evidences that they studied the press on a regular
basis. Only then does the Chairman refer to the press clippings that were not shared with
the Parties (identified in footnote 72) to make the additional point that the Applicants used
the same or similar sources as those where the information was published regarding Chile’s
representation by barristers of Essex Court Chambers. This last point is not indispensable
to the Chairman’s finding that the Applicants could and should have known that barristers

from Essex Court Chambers were working for Chile in international proceedings.

The Committee is further aware that press clippings published before the one which
triggered the Applicants’ research mentioned names of members of Essex Court Chambers
but not their affiliation to the Chambers. The Committee understands the Applicants’
argument that this made it impossible or unreasonably difficult for them to match the
publicly available information with Essex Court Chambers and Messrs. Berman and
Veeder. However, while the Applicants have presented this argument before the
Committee, it does not appear to have been raised before the Chairman. The Applicants’
submissions before the Chairman set out that their challenge was formulated promptly after
the press article was discovered on 20 September 2016, but it did not argue why the
Applicants could not have found the relevant information at an earlier date.**4 In addition,
the argument is not self-evident. It may be convincing when presented, but it does not come
to mind on a first analysis of the relevant facts. The Committee considers that, in the same
way as for an excess of power to be “manifest,” it must be perceived without a thorough
analysis,**> for a decision of the Chairman to be plainly unreasonable its defect must be
perceivable with little effort and without deeper analysis. This is not the case here, since

the Applicants’ argument regarding the conclusions that could or could not be drawn from

+84 Claimants’ Proposal for the Disqualification of Messrs. Berman and Veeder, 22 November 2016, paras. 74 ss.

(C-118).

press clippings before the one which triggered their research does not come to mind on a

first analysis.

In addition, the Chairman’s decision is not based exclusively on the finding impugned by
the Applicants that they could and should have discovered that other members of Essex

Court Chambers worked for Chile in international proceedings through the press.

One further element in the Chairman’s reasoning is that the Applicants could and should
have questioned Mr. Veeder about the professional relationships of other barristers of

Essex Court Chambers:

92. [...] Si les Demanderesses étaient préoccupées par des

conflits d'intéréts potentiels susceptibles de résulter des

relations professionnelles d'autres barristers des Essex

Court Chambers, elles auraient pu soulever ce point au

moment de la nomination des Arbitres mis en cause. Cela

aurait été prudent, notamment car il est notoire que les

chambers de barristers considérent que les barristers

opérent dans une stricte indépendance les uns a l’égard des

autres, et que les chambers ne sont pas traitées comme

l’équivalent de cabinets d'avocats en matiére de conflits. Le

dossier de la procédure ne contient aucun élément indiquant

que les Demanderesses avaient des préoccupations a ce

sujet.
The Chairman’s reasoning in this respect is based on the specific circumstances of the case,
namely that the Applicants knew President Berman and Mr. Veeder were members of the
same barristers’ chamber, on the one hand, and that barristers’ chambers are generally
known for considering that their members are independent from each other, on the other
hand. Based on these two elements of prior knowledge and of general knowledge,
respectively, it was not plainly unreasonable for the Chairman to consider that if the
Applicants had concerns regarding possible conflicts of interests arising from membership
in the same barristers’ chamber, they could have raised the issue at the time the Arbitrators
were appointed. Neither was it plainly unreasonable for the Chairman to take account of
this element in his appreciation as to whether the challenge had been brought in a timely

manner.

155

595.

596.

597.

598.

Another further element relied on by the Chairman was that the challenge had been brought
after the Award had been rendered, whereas ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 provides that
challenges must be brought promptly “and in any event before the proceeding is declared

closed”:

94. Pour que la Demande de récusation soit considérée
comme ayant été soumise “dans les plus brefs délais”, elle
aurait dit étre soumise au début de l'instance de nouvel
examen, et en tous les cas avant sa cléture. Le Tribunal de
nouvel examen, tel que reconstitué, a commencé l'instance
en janvier 2014, a clét l'instance en mars 2016 et a rendu la
Sentence rejetant les prétentions des Demanderesses le 13
septembre 2016. Les Demanderesses ont fait une demande
de renseignements sur la représentation du Chili par des
barristers des Essex Court Chambers pour la premiere fois
Te 20 septembre 2016 et leur Demande a été soumise le 22
novembre 2016. Le Président du Conseil administratif
considére que cette Demande ne peut étre considerée comme
soumise “dans les plus brefs délais” au sens de l'article 9(1)
du Réglement d’arbitrage, et doit étre rejetée. [emphasis
added ; footnotes omitted]

This reasoning, based on the terms of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) goes at the finality of
arbitral awards. In the present case, it was concerned with the fact that the Resubmission
Tribunal was resurrected by a request for the correction of errors made by the Applicants
after they had addressed the Secretary-General regarding the alleged conflict of interest

and the Secretary-General’s response that the Resubmission Tribunal was functus officio.

Again, the Chairman identified a relevant Arbitration Rule, took into account of its express
terms, and confronted them with the specific features of the facts of the case that were
relevant for the application of the Rule. This syllogistic reasoning is not plainly

unreasonable.

Considering these observations together, it was not plainly unreasonable and untenable for
the Chairman of the Administrative Council to apply ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) and
decide that the Applicants’ proposal to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder, made

after the closing of the proceeding, was not made promptly.

603.

It may also be recalled that neither President Berman nor Mr. Veeder had positive
knowledge of relations between members of Essex Court Chambers and Chile at the time
the Resubmission Award was rendered. As a consequence, such relations could not impair

their judgment with respect to the Resubmission Award.

Therefore, the Chairman’s Decision of 21 February 2017 does not violate the integrity of
the ICSID proceeding, and the Committee has no authority to disregard it and decide the

issue de novo.

On 13 April 2017, the Chairman of the Administrative Council rendered a second
“Decision on the Proposals to Disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC and Sir Franklin Berman
QC.” The Decision combines two distinct proposals for the disqualification of each one,

based on unrelated assertions.

With respect to Mr. Veeder, the Applicants scrutinized the declarations that he had made
to explain why he had resigned as president in a different ICSID case.**° The Committee

has carefully studied the allegations and finds them correctly summarised by the Chairman:

The Claimants’ proposal to disqualify Mr. V.V. Veeder QC
rests, in substance, on two grounds: a) Mr. V.V. Veeder QC
lied concerning when he learned that Sir Christopher
Greenwood QC’s was appearing as counsel for the claimants
in the Vannessa Ventures case (“First Ground”); and b) Mr.
V.V. Veeder QC lied when he explained his resignation was
not due to the fact that Sir Christopher Greenwood was
practicing at Essex Court Chambers (“Second Ground”).**”

The Chairman compared the Applicants’ allegations with Mr. Veeder’s explanations as
well as additional documents submitted by the Parties and Mr. Veeder. As a result of his

review, he did not find “any evidence that Mr. V.V. Veeder QC lied as alleged by the

+36 Annulment Application, paras. 141-165.

Franklin Berman QC, 13 April 2017, para. 51.

606.

Claimants.”*** In paragraphs 54 to 67 of the decision, he stated the reasons for his analysis

and determination.

The Chairman’s interpretation of the evidence contradicts the Applicants’ interpretation.
The Committee has no authority to decide between the two interpretations. It is not a court
of appeal. Rather, it has to examine whether the Chairman’s analysis and determination are
clearly unreasonable and untenable and violate the integrity and propriety of the

proceeding.

The Committee has studied the Chairman’s analysis. The Chairman considered that the
Applicants’ allegation that Mr. Veeder lied was based on the assumption that the terms he
used, “at the jurisdictional hearing” referred to the precise moment of the hearing — the
physical appearance of counsel before the tribunal — rather than to the broader period of
time. The Chairman notes that Mr. Veeder has explained that he had learned about the
relevant facts during the hearing preparation period, a few days before the hearings started.
The Chairman concludes that the terms used by Mr. Veeder do not constitute a lie or a
misleading formulation.**° This is a consistent assessment of facts, neither influenced by
dishonest submissions nor by bias, and neither untenable nor unreasonable. Therefore, the

Committee has no authority to disregard it and to decide the issue de novo.

With respect to President Berman, the Applicants take issue with his letter of 1 March 2017
where he comments the second challenge of Mr. Veeder. President Berman wrote that “it
does not seem to me right that I should sit on this challenge” because it “would lay itself
open to an accusation that I lacked the necessary objectivity an impartiality,” especially as
“the new challenge, based as it is on the same ground as the old challenge, is not dissimilar
to an appeal against the rejection of the latter.” He had therefore opined that “it would be

more conducive to the health of the arbitration system [...] if the new challenge, like the

old, were to be heard and decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. That
would not, in my view, be in any sense incompatible with the provisions of the Convention

and the Rules.”4#°

The Committee has already rejected the Applicants’ assertion that the Chairman of the
Administrative Council appropriated authority that he did not have when he took it upon

himself to decide on the challenge after having received President Berman’s letter.

Further, the Committee has carefully studied the Chairman’s detailed analysis and
determination with respect to the merits of the Applicants’ proposal, in paragraphs 68-77
of the Decision. That analysis dismissed a number of the Applicants’ assertions as
manifestly incorrect. The Chairman thus considered that President Berman did not state
that the new challenge against Mr. Veeder was “completely identical” to the previous one
but that it was “not dissimilar.” The Chairman further considered that President Berman
did not prevent the Applicants from accessing documents as contended by the Applicants,
since he did not have the authority to authorise their disclosure, and the Applicants had
requested them from the Centre, not from President Berman. On the basis of these and
other assessments, the Chairman provided a different interpretation of President Berman’s
letter than the Applicants. The Committee has no authority to decide between these
different interpretations. It is not a court of appeal. Rather, it has to examine whether the
Chairman’s analysis and determinations are clearly unreasonable and untenable, and

violate the integrity and propriety of the proceeding.

In this respect, the Committee observes, first, that the Chairman’s interpretation of the letter
is consistent with its text as reproduced above. Second, the Chairman did not apply a
manifestly erroneous test in considering that “a third party undertaking a reasonable

evaluation of Sir Franklin Berman QC’s letter dated 1 March 2017 would not find a

+0 Letter of Sir Franklin Berman to the Secretary-General of ICSID, 1 March 2017 (C-160).

manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.”*“! It

follows that the Chairman’s decision is not clearly unreasonable and untenable.

Therefore, the Committee has no authority to disregard the Chairman’s Decision and to

decide the issue de novo.

None of the specific circumstances relied upon by the Applicants warrant a different

conclusion in this respect:

The fact that the Chairman’s decisions were taken after the Resubmission procedure,
i.e. in the course of the proceedings on the request for rectification, does not warrant a
de novo examination but to the contrary, contributed to the Chairman’s finding that the

challenge had not been brought in a timely manner.

Neither is a de novo examination warranted by reason of the fact that the Chairman did
not take the merits into account but concentrated on purely procedural considerations
which allegedly have no res iudicata effect. The rules on timeliness are part and parcel
of the balance between the safeguard of independence and impartiality, on the one
hand, and legal certainty, on the other hand. The finding on timeliness is therefore res
iudicata as concerns the challenge, in the same way as a finding on the merits would

be.

No new facts have emerged after the Chairman’s decisions that alter the conclusions

reached above.

In sum, the ad hoc Committee decides that it would exceed its powers as determined at
paragraphs 558 ss. above to determine that the Resubmission Tribunal was not properly
constituted. Therefore, it rejects the Applicants’ request to annul the Resubmission Award

based on Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.

Franklin Berman QC, 13 April 2017, para. 77.

616.

It follows from there that the Resubmission Award was rendered by a properly constituted
Tribunal. Therefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ request to annul the
Resubmission Award, which they base on the assertion that an award rendered by an
improperly constituted tribunal also represents a serious departure from a fundamental rule
of procedure, in accordance with Article 52(1)(d). The Committee does not doubt the
correctness of the statement. However, the requirements for this ground are not met in the

present case.

THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S TREATMENT OF EVIDENCE AND BURDEN OF PROOF

 

The Applicants’ assertions on the Resubmission Tribunal’s manifest excess of powers, its
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and its failure to state the reasons
on which it has based the Resubmission Award are closely interrelated. They submit that
the Resubmission Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by rejecting evidence on facts
that had occurred before the entry into force of the BIT on 29 March 1994 as well as after
the initiation of the arbitration on 3 November 1997. By doing so, they submit, the
Resubmission Tribunal refused to hear and consider the Applicants’ case and demonstrated
bias and partiality in Chile’s favour, and it deconstructed the First Award through

contradictory, frivolous and incomprehensible reasoning.
dd) General background

The analysis of these assertions requires a full understanding of the Resubmission
Tribunal’s conduct and reasoning taking into account the determinations of the First
Tribunal and the First Committee and considering the arguments and conduct of the Parties
which are still relevant in this phase of the proceeding. The exercise is as complex as it is

unavoidable.

The First Tribunal, the Resubmission Tribunal, the First Committee, the Applicants and
the Respondent agree that the confiscations between 1973 and 1975 by the military regime

were illegal, anti-constitutional and warranted compensation under Chilean law.

161

617.

618.

619.

620.

The First Tribunal found and the First Committee and the Resubmission Tribunal
confirmed and accepted as final that Mr. Pey was an investor when the confiscation was
completed in 1975 and that the Applicants were investors when they initiated the ICSID
arbitration in 1997. In so finding, both tribunals and the First Committee rejected the
Respondent’s argument that Mr. Pey’s alleged investments ceased to exist with the
confiscation,*? contrary to the Applicants’ allegation that the Resubmission Tribunal had
followed the Respondent’s arguments. Therefore, the allegation that the Resubmission

Tribunal was partial does not find a basis in the Resubmission Award.“

That is the factual background that brought the First Tribunal to ascertain its jurisdiction
ratione temporis, in accordance with Article 2(2) BIT, which extends its applicability “to

investments made prior to its entry into force.”*4+

After having distinguished “la compétence ratione temporis du Tribunal de V'applicabilité
ratione temporis des obligations de fond continues dans VAPI,’*> the First Tribunal
rejected the claims for expropriation, on the basis that it was completed by Decree No. 165
of 10 February 1975. As analysed in Chapter VII.A. of this Decision, the First Tribunal
found considerations of illegality and anti-constitutionality of Decree No. 165 irrelevant
for the determination of the completion of the expropriation. The First Tribunal concluded
that “es dispositions de fond de l’API n’étaient pas applicables a lV expropriation des biens
des sociétés CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda.”“

The First Tribunal presented as a logical consequence of this finding that allegations,
discussions and evidence in relation to the expropriation were not pertinent and could not
be used to establish a prejudice resulting from a different cause. This statement is made in

unambiguous terms in Chapter VIII, paragraph 688 of the First Award:

The First Committee validated the rejection of claims based on expropriation but annulled
paragraph 4 of the dispositif of the First Award ordering Chile to compensate the
Applicants for damages “and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award

related to damages (Section VIII).”47

The First Committee “found an annullable error in the process which the Tribunal followed
in reaching its conclusion not in the way it calculated the amount of damages,”’*#* and that
“the issue in the present case is not per se the quantum of damages determined by the
Tribunal. Nor does the problem lie per se in the Tribunal’s chosen method of calculating
the damages suffered by the Claimants. The issue lies precisely in the reasoning followed
by the Tribunal to determine the appropriate method of calculation, which, as demonstrated

above, is plainly contradictory.”*?

There has been some discussion during this annulment proceeding as to what the
Committee might have meant when it annulled the “corresponding paragraphs in the body
of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)” and both Parties have referred to
paragraphs of Section VIII to back their arguments.*°° The Resubmission Tribunal also
examined paragraphs of Chapter VIII, especially where they “relate to matters of factual

evidence and proof, they are not tainted by the criticism of the ad hoc Committee relating

to the assessment of material damages,”*°! because they “illuminate the reasoning of the

First Tribunal in the un-annulled portions of the Award.”4%?

The issue is of immediate relevance with respect to paragraph 688 of the First Award. It is
notable that the First Committee repeatedly referred to paragraph 688 and quoted it twice,
each time affirmatively and drawing conclusions that hinge upon the finality of
paragraph 688. That is the case in paragraph 261 of the Annulment Decision where the
First Committee finds an acknowledgment by the First Tribunal that backs the First
Committee’s arguments, and that is the case in paragraph 283 of the Annulment Decision
where the First Committee quotes paragraph 688 to find that “the Tribunal expressly stated
that an evaluation of the damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the
expropriation was irrelevant and that all the allegations, discussion and evidence related to

such damages could not be considered by the Tribunal.”

In both cases, the First Committee made the content of paragraph 688 its own. This
becomes evident when the wording is compared. While the First Tribunal formulates in
paragraph 688 that the “preuves relatives au dommage subi par les demanderesses du fait
de l'expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas étre retenues s’agissant
d’établir un préjudice, résultant lui d’une autre cause, de fait et de de droit, celle du déni

de justice et du refus d’un ‘traitement juste et équitable’,” the First Committee formulates,
in introducing the debate on paragraph 688, that an expropriation-based calculation of
damages was irrelevant for the calculation of damages resulting from FET violations,
“since the Claimants’ claim for expropriation was outside the tremporal scope of the
BIT.” *°? It would be plainly contradictory to assume that the First Committee wanted to
confirm the substance of paragraph 688 of the First Award and at the same time to annul
it. Therefore, this Committee interprets the First Committee’s decision to annul “the

corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)”**4

451 Resubmission Award, para. 243.

as meaning that only the paragraphs that adjudicate compensation for damages resulting
from violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard by referring to the standard of
expropriation are concerned. It believes that the First Committee’s formulation in
paragraph 359(4), where it mentions “Section VIII,” is but a short-hand reference to

paragraph 359(1) and does not express the intention to contradict it.

626. Asaconsequence of the foregoing, it is res iudicata, as explicitly confirmed in paragraphs
282 and 283 of the First Annulment Decision, that the evidence presented by the Applicants
to prove their prejudice caused by the expropriation could not be taken into consideration,
neither by the First Tribunal nor by the Resubmission Tribunal, to calculate the damages

caused by the violation of fair and equitable treatment standard.

627. This is what was expressly acknowledged in the Resubmission Award. At some point, the
Resubmission Award seems to suggest the unannulled parts of the First Award only
established the breach and left the determination of the injury entirely untouched: this is
the case where the Resubmission Tribunal states that “[s]ince the first stage, the
establishment of breach, has already been determined with binding effect by the First
Award, the Tribunal can begin with the second, the ascertainment of the injury caused by
the breach.”*°> At a later stage in its reasoning, however, the Resubmission Tribunal leaves
no doubt that the First Award’s res indicata effect extends to the First Tribunal’s finding
that the damage arising from the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard
cannot be based on the damage caused by the expropriation. At paragraph 228 of its award,

the Resubmission Tribunal thus states:

The present Tribunal draws the following conclusions from
the above, which represent its interpretation of the res
judicata portions of the First Award for the purposes of
carrying out its own mandate of deciding on the
“compensation” due under paragraph 3 of the dispositive of
the First Award for the breach determined in paragraph 2
thereof: a) that the original expropriation of El Clarin and the
related assets belonging to Mr Pey Casado was
consummated in 1975 and consequently lies outside the

455 Resubmission Award, para. 217.

scope of the BIT; that all arguments based on or arising
out of the expropriation may not be taken into
consideration, except in so far as they constitute factual
background to matters that are properly within the scope of
the dispute under the BIT. [emphasis added]

And further at paragraph 230 of the Resubmission Award:

The consequence of this interpretation of the First Award is,
in the opinion of the Tribunal, as follows: [...]

d) that any assessment of injury and damage based on the

original expropriation is inconsistent with the First

Award and must therefore be rejected. [emphasis added]
For the reasons set out in paragraphs 623 to 625 above, this interpretation by the
Resubmission Tribunal was in conformity with the First Committee’s Decision and

therefore with the First Award’s res iudicata effect.
(2) The Applicants’ handling of the res iudicata effect

The Applicants assert the relevance of the evidence they presented to establish the fair
market value of their investment at the time of the confiscation in 1973/1975 from what
they consider to be a different perspective. They submitted, before the Resubmission
Tribunal, that the amount of compensation to be granted under the denial of justice/fair and
equitable treatment claims had to be appraised on the basis of the value of the assets
confiscated in 1973/1975. If the Chilean courts had not denied justice by delaying a
judgment that would have recognized the absolute nullity of Decree No.165 from the
outset, the First Tribunal would have found that the nature of the expropriation was
continuous and would have ascertained the respective claim. For that reason, the amount

of damages owed under Article 4 BIT is the equivalent of the amount due under Article 5S.

For these reasons, the Applicants requested the Resubmission Tribunal to “condamne[r] la
Défenderesse a indemniser les Demanderesses a hauteur de Vindemnisation qu’elles

auraient dit recevoir, si le déni de justice, la discrimination et leur effet n’avaient pas eu

166

630.

lieu, en compensation des saisies de CPP S.A. et EPC Ltée.”*°° In their Mémoire en

Réplique, the Applicants contended:

La conséquence du déni de justice a donc été de priver les
Demanderesses de faire pleinement valoir leurs rapports de
droit vis-a-vis l’Etat du Chili existant apres lV’entrée en
vigueur de l’API, dans leur demande de réparation pour le
préjudice résultant de la privation de facto de leur droit sur
Vinvestissement effectué en 1972 et au dédommagement
correspondant. Il s'agit bien de la réparation due au titre de
la violation par la Défenderesse de larticle 4 de l'API.
Comme cela sera exposé ultérieurement, cette réparation
doit étre calculée sur la base de la fair market value des
sociétés CPP S.A. et EPC Ltée a la veille de leur saisie de
facto.?7

In that perspective, and as instructed by the Applicants, the Applicants’ financial expert
based his calculation on the “position de départ de notre raisonnement [...] que M. Pey
avait droit a étre indemnisé au titre de la saisie en 1973 de son investissement,”*® that “un
ensemble de violations” had to be taken into account and not only the isolated acts of denial
of justice between 1995 and 2002 and/or the Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000.4 That is
why he did not do a “but for uniquement pour (en anglais) the denial of justice mais un but
for pour l’ensemble de la violation.”* He had expressed his assumption, without an exact
calculation, that the damage based on the two isolated violations of the fair and equitable

treatment standard “serait zéro.”"°!

discrimination through Decision No. 43 the amount of damage would be “zero” and that

for the denial of justice, no damage had been calculated.*

The Committee has carefully studied the reasoning of the First Award and of the First
Committee and has found that they both determined that the violations of the fair and

equitable treatment standard must be separated and isolated from the illegal expropriation.

The First Tribunal stated that “[I]a saisie et le transfert de la propriété a l’Etat des biens
des sociétés CPP S.A. et EPC Ltda sont constitutifs d’un fait consommé et distinct des

violations postérieures a l’entrée en vigueur de l’API dont font état les demanderesses.”*

Paragraphs 686 ss. of the First Award reveal what the tribunal had in mind when it used
the term “distinct.” It did not restrict the separation to the legal requirements of Articles 4
and 5 of the BIT but insisted that the evidence presented for the damages resulting from
expropriation was not relevant for damages resulting from the unfair and unequitable
treatment that had occurred after the entry into force of the BIT. This is explicitly and
unambiguously stated at paragraph 688 of the First Award, which the First Committee
validated and where the First Tribunal reasoned that “Jes [...] preuves relatives au
dommage [...] du fait de l’expropriation [...] ne peuvent pas étre retenues s’agissant
d’établir un préjudice, résultant [...] du déni de justice et du refus d’un ‘traitement juste et

équitable.’”

It is further evidenced by paragraph 689 of the First Award where the tribunal determined
that “/es demanderesses n'ont pas apporté de preuve, ou de preuve convaincante [...] des
importants dommages allégués et causés par les faits relevant de la compétence ratione

temporis du Tribunal arbitral’*™ — thus confirming, again, that the evidence the Applicants

adduced regarding the expropriation was irrelevant to the valuation of damages arising

from the breach of fair and equitable treatment.

The First Committee confirmed the First Tribunal’s determination that “the duty to provide
redress for violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end,’”4°
that “the post-BIT acts by Chile that it [the First Tribunal] ultimately considered to be treaty
violations [...] were completely separate and distinct form the 1975 expropriation,“ and
that “the parties never pleaded damages claims arising from the breaches of Article 4 of

the BIT.”4°7

The Resubmission Tribunal was confronted with these determinations. It examined both
parties’ experts during the evidentiary hearing,** summarised the Applicants’ position as

® and was convinced that the “resubmission

presented in the written submissions,“
proceedings, which were thorough and complete, allowed the Claimants the fullest
opportunity” to show “what particular injury and damage could be proved to have been
caused to them by the breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article
4 of the BIT determined in the First Award.”*”° For the reasons already mentioned, it stated
“that any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is
inconsistent with the First Award and must therefore be rejected.”4”! It further formulated
the “central question” as to whether “the Claimants have met that burden of proving what
injury was caused to either or both of them by the Respondent’s breach of the standard of
fair and equitable treatment in the BIT, and then of establishing the corresponding

assessable damage in financial terms.”47*

The Resubmission Tribunal answered the question in the negative, after having presented
the Respondent’s position, that the Applicants did not suffer “demonstrable material
damage at all” and found “much merit in the Respondent’s submission.”*7? However, the
decisive point for the Resubmission Tribunal was that the Applicants failed “to address
their own burden of proof.”*”4 The brusqueness of the statement might seem inconsiderate,
as it was, indeed, resented by the Applicants. However, in the light of the above, the
statement must be understood as meaning that the Applicants failed to adduce evidence of
their prejudice that was not based on the value of the expropriated assets and which the
Resubmission Tribunal could take into account given the res iudicata effect of the First
Award. This is correct, since the Applicants argued before the Resubmission Tribunal that

the damages should be calculated by reference to the expropriation.

This conclusion does not contradict the First Tribunal’s observation, as asserted by the
Applicants, that it was not hindered “de prendre en considération des faits antérieurs a la
date d’entrée en vigueur du traité pour examiner le contexte dans lequel sont intervenus
les actes que les demanderesses estiment devoir étre qualifiés de violations postérieures a
lentrée en vigueur du traité,” for “purposes of understanding the background, the causes,
or scope of violations of the BIT that occurred after its entry into force.” *”> The
Resubmission Tribunal echoes this view when it writes that it would take evidence and
arguments on expropriation into consideration “in so far as they constitute factual
background to matters that are properly within the scope of the dispute under the BIT.”47°
However, while these passages taken in isolation might warrant the approach taken by the
Applicants before the Resubmission Tribunal, this isolated reading was contradicted by the
unambiguous determination by the First Tribunal, that the valuation of damages for the
breach of fair and equitable treatment could not be based on the value of the expropriated

assets.

Therefore, when the Resubmission Tribunal rejected the evidence which the Applicants
presented in the context of the expropriation to prove damages caused by violations of
Article 4 BIT, it neither exceeded its powers, nor was it biased when it followed the res
iudicata determination of the First Tribunal as confirmed by the First Committee. The fact
that the decision favoured the Respondent cannot be interpreted as a documentation of bias.
Further, the Resubmission Tribunal has repeatedly and consistently explained why it felt
obliged to reject the evidence, in other words it stated the reasons that motivated its

decision.

This Committee understands that since the Applicants considered, in good faith, that
paragraphs 611 and 614 of the First Award allowed them to base their claim for reparation
before the Resubmission Tribunal on the value of the expropriated assets, they could not
understand the Resubmission Tribunal’s statement that they had failed to address their
burden of proof. As set out above, however, the Applicants’ position was based on an

erroneous interpretation of the res iudicata effect of the First Award.
(3) The alleged “denial of justice”

The Resubmission Tribunal did not commit a denial of justice by not considering the
evidence for expropriation, as asserted by the Applicants in reliance on Professor Benjamin
Remy’s comment of the Resubmission Award.*”’ Professor Remy’s argument is that the
damages related to the denial of justice consist in a loss of opportunity to obtain
compensation for the expropriation in Chilean courts based on Chilean law, and that the
Resubmission Tribunal took too broad a view on the res iudicata effect of the First Award
in holding that it precluded the Resubmission Tribunal from calculating the damage caused
by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard by reference to the value of the

expropriated assets.

Professor Remy more specifically argues that the res indicata effect of the First Tribunal’s

finding that the expropriation of 1973 did not violate the BIT precluded the Resubmission

645.

Tribunal from finding that the expropriation did violate the BIT, but did not prevent it from
taking account of the expropriation as a fact for the purpose of evaluating the damage
caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.*”* This analysis would
be undisputable if the First Award’s res iudicata effect were indeed limited to the finding
that the expropriation did not violate the BIT. However, as set out in detail in the previous
section, the First Award’s res iudicata effect as determined by the First Committee was not
so limited. It extended to the finding that the evidence relating to the damage caused by the
expropriation could not be used to establish the damage caused by the denial of justice and
the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Accordingly, the Resubmission

Tribunal did not take too broad a view of the First Award’s res iudicata effect.

As a consequence, the Resubmission Tribunal did not commit a denial of justice in
dismissing the Applicants’ argument seeking to establish the damage caused by the denial
of justice and the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard on the basis of the

damage caused by the expropriation.

In addition, the Applicants erred in complaining that the Resubmission Tribunal oriented
the issue of the nullity of Decree No. 165 and the resulting claims towards the “domestic
sphere” by stating that “if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decision No. 43 did
indeed have decisive significance, the consequence would surely be that the investment
continued to be, in law, the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation, the remedy
for which could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this Tribunal.”*”? This
opinion, they assert, equates to a denial of justice by the Resubmission Tribunal, since it
knew that the Applicants had chosen international arbitration under the fork in the road
clause in Article 10 of the BIT and that this choice was “irreversible.”**° The assertion is
incorrect because the Resubmission Tribunal did not dismiss the Applicants’ claim for
damages under international law because it considered there was a claim to be brought

under domestic law. Rather, having found that there was no remedy in the international

sphere, the Resubmission Tribunal added obiter that it could possibly be found in the
domestic sphere: “the remedy could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this
Tribunal in these resubmission proceedings” (emphasis added). Accordingly, the
Resubmission Tribunal did not dismiss the Applicants’ international claim to the advantage
of a domestic claim. It dismissed the international claim on its own merits. This is not a
denial of justice. Nor is it a denial of justice that due to the exercise of their rights under
the fork-in-the-road provision, the Applicants are deprived of compensation in both the

domestic and international spheres.
(4) The arguments and evidence postdating the request for arbitration

The Applicants not only alleged an improper lack of consideration of evidence and
arguments before the entry into force of the BIT in 1994, they also alleged that the
Resubmission Tribunal rejected arguments and evidence covering the period after

3 November 1997, date of the request for arbitration.

The Applicants refer to paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award. The Committee has
carefully studied that paragraph and finds that the thrust of the Resubmission Tribunal’s
reasoning is that it has no authority to address issues, arguments and evidence that were
not before the First Tribunal, i.e. having occurred “after the handing down of the First
Award.” It is true that the Resubmission Tribunal refers to the critical date of the original
request for arbitration and states that issues arising between the Parties after that date do
not fall within the scope of Resubmission Proceeding. However, it is also true that the
Resubmission Tribunal accepted, without hesitation, the determination of the First Tribunal
as res iudicata with respect to the actions and omissions of the Respondent that occurred
after the request for arbitration, in particular, the Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 and the
unsuccessful Chilean court proceedings that had lasted 7 years before they were abandoned

on 2 November 2002 in order to expand the scope of the ICSID proceedings.

The Resubmission Tribunal also accepted the First Tribunal’s determination that disputes

between the Parties had begun in 2000 and 2002, leading to the establishment of

173

649.

650.

651.

652.

jurisdiction under Article 2.3 BIT.**! However, it had not taken into consideration that a
Chilean court rendered a judgment on 24 July 2008 on the nullity of Decree No. 165. This
judgment post-dates the First Award of 8 May 2008, and the Applicants have, indeed,
criticised the Tribunal for not having taken issues into account “postérieurs a la Sentence
Initiale.”**

Taken together, the Committee finds that in paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award the
Tribunal tried to express that it had no jurisdiction over issues, arguments and evidence
that had not been before the First Tribunal. That is reflected in the repeated affirmation that

issues arising after the date of the First Award are outside the scope of the proceedings.

A different interpretation of the Resubmission Tribunal’s reasoning would lead to the
contradictory and absurd result that the Committee would have to assume that the
Resubmission Tribunal considers on the one hand that events that were before the First
Tribunal would be outside the scope, and on the other hand that the events between 1997

and 2008 that were before the Tribunal would be inside the scope of the proceedings.

The Tribunal’s reasoning is intelligible when paragraph 216 of the Resubmission Award
is read in the context of the general reasoning as meaning that issues, arguments and
evidence that have not been submitted before the First Tribunal were outside the scope of
the resubmission proceedings. This interpretation corresponds to paragraphs 68/69 of the
Resubmission Award, where the Tribunal lists events that have not been before the First

Tribunal and that the Applicants qualified as a new denial of justice.

This interpretation is all the more appropriate since the alternative literal interpretation and
a finding on its internal contradiction would not impact on the result. Even accepting its
insufficiency, the Resubmission Tribunal has not followed its own statement but accepted
all of the determinations of the First Tribunal based on facts occurring after 3 November

1997 and before the date of the Award on 8 May 2008 as res iudicata.

656.

For all these reasons, the Committee determines that the Resubmission Tribunal’s
treatment of evidence and the qualification of the burden of proof do not contain annullable
errors rising to the level of a manifest excess of powers or a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure. It further holds that the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail

to state the reasons on which it has based the Award.

THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S ALLEGED FAILURE TO GIVE RES IUDICATA EFFECT TO

UNANNULLED FINDINGS,

The ad hoc Committee also has to determine whether the Resubmission Tribunal, when

dealing with the First Award and delimitating the annulled parts and the final findings:

(1) manifestly exceeded its powers;
(2) seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure; and/or

(3) failed to state the reasons on which it based the Award.
(1) Manifest excess of powers
The Committee recalls that a resubmission tribunal exceeds its powers when:

- it determines an issue de novo that the original tribunal already determined, and that
was confirmed by an ad hoc committee and not annulled and therefore is final, res
iudicata;

- it fails to decide issues brought before it although it had the mandate and power to

decide; and

- it fails to apply the applicable law instead of applying and interpreting it, even

erroneously.

The standard is uncontroversial and explicitly acknowledged by the Resubmission

Tribunal. It noted that:

[I]t has been finally determined: that the dispute falls within
ICSID jurisdiction; that Chile (the Respondent) was in

175

657.

658.

breach of its obligation to accord to the Claimants fair and
equitable treatment (including to abstain from any denial of
justice); that the Claimants have a right to compensation; and
finally that any further or other claims were rejected. All of
that, in other words, has the quality of res judicata (‘chose
jugée’)

[..]

Not only is there no need for the Tribunal to go into these
matters, but it would be a manifest excess of its own
jurisdiction if the Tribunal purported to do so.***

The Committee will analyse the issue of compensation at a later stage. Here, at the outset,
it rejects the Applicants’ assertions that the Resubmission Tribunal re-opened the debate
and analysis on the protection of the Applicants’ rights and investment through the BIT of
1994 against unfair and unequitable treatment that had occurred during 1995 and 2002 for
the denial of justice and in 2000 for arbitrary and discriminatory treatment. In accepting
the First Tribunal’s determination and not deciding de novo on the relevance of facts after
1997, the Resubmission Tribunal respected the res iudicata determination on the fair and
equitable treatment standard violations and on the relevance of facts after 1997. The fact
that the Resubmission Tribunal asked questions during the hearing on the issues of
investment and on the relevance of Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000 is irrelevant for this

finding since the questions are not reflected in the Award.

(a) The First Annulment Decision as concerns Section VIII of the First

Award

The Applicants also allege that the Resubmission Tribunal re-opened the issue of evidence
with respect to injury and damages and their causation by the violation of Article 4 BIT
against the res iudicata determination of the First Tribunal according to which the
arguments, the theory and the evidence presented by the Applicants for the injury and
damage caused by the confiscation in 1973-1975 met the requirements of identification

and proof of injury and damages caused by the unfair and unequitable treatment. The

483 Resubmission Award, paras. 176, 178 (footnotes omitted).

661.

662.

Applicants allege that the Resubmission Tribunal came to its erroneous appreciation
because it systematically and fraudulently confused the issues of injury and damage on the

one hand and compensation and quantum on the other.

In order to properly assess these assertions, it is necessary to appraise exactly which parts
of the First Annulment Decision were established as res iudicata of the First Award and

which parts were annulled.

The First Committee squarely annulled the First Award’s decision on quantum of
compensation. However, as already quoted in paragraphs 620 ss. of this Decision, it is less
evident what it intended to annul when it stated “and the corresponding paragraphs in the
body of the Award related to damages (Section VIII)” and later that “the body of the Award

but for Section VIII are res judicata.”4*4

That sounds straightforward without being so. As we have seen, the First Committee relied
on several of the paragraphs from Section VIII to make certain arguments. This Committee
does not assume that the First Committee would have approved the content of statements
that it considered should be annulled. Further, at the beginning of Section VIII, the First
Tribunal summarised that the Applicants were investors and treated unfairly and
unequitably by the Respondent, that Article 4 BIT is applicable, that the illegality of the
confiscations is uncontested,**> and that it remains as the Tribunal’s task “a tirer les
conséquences de ce qui précéde, quant a l’obligation d’indemniser, son exécution concréte

et le calcul de son montant.”**°

If the First Committee’s determination in paragraph 359 of its Decision was interpreted as
meaning that Section VIII is annulled in its totality, this would lead to the absurd result that
key determinations of the First Award would be annulled as being part of Section VIII,
while the very same determinations would be upheld as also being part of the unannulled

Section VII. Accordingly, the Committee interprets paragraph 359 of the First Annulment

484 First Annulment Decision, paras. 359(1) and (4).

Decision, as already presented in paragraph 625 of this Decision, as meaning that only

those paragraphs of Section VIII that deal with the adjudication of damages are annulled.

As a consequence, it is res iudicata that (a) the claim for compensation for the injury and
damage caused by the illegal confiscation is outside the temporal scope of the BIT and that
(b) the claim for compensation for the injury and damage caused by the fair and equitable
standard violations is inside the scope of the BIT. These are final determinations of the
First Tribunal, as developed in Section VII and summarised in the first five paragraphs of

Section VIII of the First Award and as validated by the First Committee.

Section VII of the First Award does not specifically explain whether the damages caused
by the completed expropriation and thereby their proof and calculation are also precluded
ratione temporis. The First Tribunal notes that the instantaneous act of the expropriation

“n’est pas créatrice d’une situation continue” and that the expropriatory acts “étant
achevés et ne pouvant donner naissance @ une situation continue.”**’ It further referred to
the Articles on Responsibility of States, which provide, in Article 14, that the breach of an
international obligation occurs when the act is performed, define in Article 2 that a breach
of an international obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful act, and establish in
Article 31 the obligation of full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally

wrongful act. This implies that injuries caused by breaches that are not covered by an

international treaty cannot be adjudicated.

These reasons indicate that the First Tribunal considered that the facts and evidence
proving damages and quantum caused by the expropriation could not be taken into
consideration for violations that occurred after the entry into force of the BIT. By no means
do they indicate positively that the Tribunal found these facts and evidence relevant for the

proof of damages caused by the violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard.

Apparently, the Resubmission Tribunal was in no hurry to develop its findings on injury

and damage in Section VII, because it had reserved the discussion on the three issues (1)

+87 First Award, para. 610.

178

“obligation d’indemniser,” (2) “son exécution concrete,” (3) “et le calcul de son montant”

for Section VIII, as exposed in paragraph 679 of the First Award.

667. Paragraph 679 is part of the introductory portion of Section VIII. The Applicants have
consistently argued that it is not annulled and have relied on it for their arguments.*** The
Committee agrees with the Applicants: it does not concern the damages but refers back to

Section VII and clarifies it.**?

668. This reading of paragraph 679 is reinforced by the First Annulment Decision. In Section G
of the First Annulment Decision, which is devoted to “Damages,” the First Committee
states, in paragraph 262, that the “Parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from
the breaches of Article 4 f the BIT” and specifies in paragraphs 267 to 269 that it
understands “damages claims” as meaning “the standard of compensation and evaluation

of damages” as well as “damages methodology and calculations.”

669. Taken together, these findings of the First Tribunal, as confirmed by the First Committee,
give strong indications in favour of an interpretation consistent with the Resubmission
Tribunal’s finding that the First Tribunal had not considered the facts and evidence with
regard to the uncontested illegal expropriation as relevant for the proof of damages and
their amount under Article 4 BIT, and that “all evidence and arguments related to that

over compensation under

670. This interpretation is further reinforced by paragraph 688 of the First Award, which

confirms the existence of damages caused by confiscation but adds that:

l’expropriation, manquent de pertinence et ne peuvent pas

d’une autre cause, de fait et de droit, celle du déni de justice
et du refus d’un “traitement juste et équitable”. *°!
As explained in paragraph 625 of this Decision, the First Committee has repeatedly

approved this statement of the First Tribunal.

As a consequence, the Committee holds that the First Tribunal did not determine, with res
iudicata effect, that the proof of damages caused by the confiscation was relevant for the
proof of damages caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It
actually determined the opposite. Therefore, the Resubmission Tribunal did not disrespect
a res iudicata finding and did not exceed its powers when it decided not to consider the
evidence relied upon by the Applicants, and when it decided to examine whether the fair
and equitable treatment standard violations, as a distinct claim, had caused injury and

damage.
(b) The Resubmission Tribunal’s interpretation of the term “compensation”

With respect to the Resubmission Tribunal’s determination not to grant financial
compensation by defining the concept of compensation in a way that contradicts the First

Tribunal’s res iudicata decision, the Applicants present two related arguments.

First, they assert that the Parties had agreed that under international law the term
compensation necessarily implies pecuniary indemnification and that the Resubmission

Tribunal was bound to exercise its authority in respect of this agreement.

In paragraphs 200 and 201 of its Award, the Resubmission Tribunal took note of the fact
that during the hearing the Applicants had argued that it should “understand the term
‘compensation’ as referring only to monetary compensation”, and that the “Respondent,
for its part, agreed with much of the Claimants’ answer.” The Tribunal had taken “note of

these views but does not subscribe fully to the reading.”*°*

The Committee agrees with the Applicants’ argument that the authority of arbitral tribunals
is based on the agreement of parties which exercise their autonomy and that tribunals
exceed their authority by not respecting the parties’ agreements. However, an agreement
in the meaning of a common expression of the parties’ intention to enter into a binding

undertaking requires a meeting of the minds in this sense.

This is not the case when, as here, the Parties hold similar views on an issue of
interpretation of the law. In such instance, there is no meeting of their minds binding the

Tribunal in its interpretative powers.

This leads to a second assertion. The Applicants submit that independently of the Parties
agreement, the term “compensation” in international law, as described and specified by
Articles 31-39 of the Articles on State Responsibility, necessarily refers to financial
reparation as expressed in Article 36 and not to satisfaction under Article 37, which is

reserved to cases where compensation does not provide full reparation of damages.

The Committee essentially agrees with the Applicants’ argument. The Resubmission
Tribunal cannot be blamed for not having defined the term “compensation” by reference
to Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility, because the Resubmission Tribunal
was explicitly using the French term “compensation” as in the French authentic version of
the First Award,*%* and the French version of Article 36 uses the term “indemnisation,” not
“compensation.” It remains, however, that the term “compensation” was used in the First
Award as a term of art influenced by English legal terminology and referring to financial

reparation.

The Resubmission Tribunal, however, considered that the fact that the internationally
wrongful act in the present case “[was] one in which the breach is constituted not by a
single act but by a course of conduct” changed the factual situation in a way that a different

interpretation of the term “compensation” was adequate.*” In that perspective, it “[saw] in

495

the First Award no sign that the First Tribunal was setting out to make a conceptually
systematic usage of these various terms that would justify treating paragraph 3 [of the First
Award] as a deliberate determination that monetary damages must necessarily follow.”4>
Therefore, the Resubmission Tribunal felt authorised to give the term a broader meaning

than the one necessarily encompassing a financial element.

The Committee disagrees. It does not make any difference whether a wrongful act is a
single act or “a course of conduct,” as explicitly provided for in Articles 14 and 15 of the
Articles on State Responsibility. A course of conduct cannot remove the wrongfulness of
one or many acts, and it cannot remove the obligation of the wrongdoer to make full

reparation for injury, as provided for in Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility.

The Committee hesitated as to how to qualify the Resubmission Tribunal’s approach: as a
non-annullable misapplication and misinterpretation of international law or as an

annullable non-application of the applicable law.

In that context, the Committee recalls that it is not a court of appeal. It is convinced that “a
misapplication of the applicable law is not an annullable error [...] provided it is not of a
magnitude as to amount to a veritable non-application of the proper law as a whole.”*”° It
is also conscious of the legitimacy of the annulment mechanism. Its objective is to
“reconcile finality of the award with the need to prevent flagrant cases of excess of

jurisdiction and injustice.”4°”

In this perspective, the Committee has examined what the impact on the result of the
Resubmission Proceeding would be if the Resubmission Tribunal had correctly interpreted
the term “compensation” as used in the First Award. No annulment should follow if the
error has no bearing on the outcome of the proceeding. This is of direct relevance to the

upon to make a final determination on the qualification of the Tribunal’s error under the

circumstances of the case.

For the Resubmission Tribunal to have manifestly exceeded its power, the finding of the
First Tribunal would have to be read as meaning, not that the Applicants have a right to
compensation provided that their prejudice is established, but that they have an unreserved

right to compensation whatever the evidence or the absence thereof.

The interpretation of the First Award as conferring upon the Applicants an unreserved right
to compensation irrespective of the evidence is not reasonable. It is incompatible with the
prohibition under Article 42(3) Convention for ICSID Tribunals to decide ex aequo et bono

unless the parties so agree.

It follows that the Applicants’ “right to compensation” pursuant to the res iudicata effect
of the First Award must be interpreted as being implicitly conditional on the establishment
of damages in accordance with the applicable rules of international law. Therefore, the
First Award accords the Applicants a right to compensation “for any financially assessable

damage that they may establish.”

In light of this, the Resubmission Tribunal affirmed that it read the First Tribunal’s
determination that the Applicants “ont droit & compensation” (paragraph 3 of the
dispositif), following the determination that the Respondent violated its duty to guarantee
fair and equitable treatment (paragraph 2 of the dispositif) and preceding the order to pay

a precise amount of compensation (paragraph 4 of the dispositif):

[A]s stating the entitlement to reparation that necessarily
follows from the determination of the breach of an
international obligation, but without predetermining what
form or nature that reparation must take, except perhaps the
non-explicit assumption that in the normal case it may take
the form of monetary damages. But it does not read the
paragraph as absolving a party claiming monetary damages

183

689.

690.

691.

692.

from its normal obligation to prove such damage, including

its causation.4°°
Thus the Resubmission Tribunal referred to two cumulative limbs for the adjudication of
damages. One is the “form or nature” of reparation and the other is the burden to prove the
damage. As concerns the burden of proof, the Resubmission Tribunal reasons that it is “a

basic tenet of investment arbitration that a claimant must prove its pleaded loss.”4?

By this line of reasoning, the Resubmission Tribunal refers to the definition in Article 36(2)
of the Articles on State Responsibility which links compensation to “financially assessable
damage.” The Resubmission Tribunal did not state that the Applicants did not suffer
damage. Nor did it state that the damage was not financially assessable. What it did state
is — and that it is not in contradiction to a res iudicata finding — that material damage not
only had to be assessable but assessed and proven as resulting from violations of the fair

and equitable treatment standard to justify compensation.

The First Tribunal identified two distinct claims, one based on illegal expropriation and
another one based on violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It found that
the expropriation claim was outside the temporal scope of the BIT. It therefore urged Chile
to compensate the Applicants under Chilean law, because it did not see a basis for
compensation under international law. The Resubmission Tribunal came to a similar

conclusion in paragraph 198 of the Resubmission Award.

The First Tribunal also found that damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable
treatment standard would have been inside the temporal scope of the BIT but that the
Applicants had concentrated their efforts on proving damages caused by that violation on
the damage caused by expropriation and thus, had not discharged their burden of proof
with respect to damage caused by violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard.
Driven by the wish to grant some monetary compensation, the First Tribunal replaced the

Applicants’ burden to prove damages by some “éléments objectifs,” which it had found in

48 Resubmission Award, para. 201.

+9 Resubmission Award, para. 205.

695.

a parallel compensation for expropriation.*° It reproduced this line of reasoning in
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the dispositif of the First Award and condemned the Respondent
to pay an amount of money to the Applicants although the damage had not been proven,

and had relied on calculations which had been made to assess the damage for expropriation.

The First Committee annulled this reasoning and result because the Parties had not been
afforded an opportunity to be heard on the methodology, standard and calculation, and
because they were contradictory in the sense that they neutralised each other. It found that
the allocation of damages based on the value of the expropriated assets contradicted the
Tribunal’s previous finding that the evidence regarding the damage caused by the
expropriation was irrelevant since the expropriation did not fall in the temporal scope of
application of the treaty. As a result, it is res iudicata that the Respondent violated the fair
and equitable treatment standard after the entry into force of the BIT and after the request
for arbitration, and that it owed the Applicants compensation, but it is not res iudicata that
the Applicants discharged their burden of proof for injury and damage suffered nor, in the
alternative, that they were entitled to receive compensation without having to prove the

existence and quantum of injury and damage.

The Resubmission Tribunal tried to avoid the First Tribunal’s annulled errors. It
appropriated the First Tribunal’s general statement that the Applicants bore the burden of
proving that damage had been caused by the distinct fair and equitable treatment standard
violations, that the proof of damages resulting from expropriation was irrelevant, and could
not be transplanted, and that “Ja simple vraisemblance d’un dommage dans les
circonstances concreétes de l’espéce ne [suffisait] évidemment pas.”*"!

The Resubmission Tribunal relied on these findings of the First Tribunal because it
considered them to be principles of international law. The Resubmission Tribunal insisted
that it:

[B]elieves this analysis to be entirely consistent with the
findings of the ad hoc Committee in its Annulment Decision,

502

notably its paragraph 261, in which the ad hoc Committee

draws from the First Award the holdings by the First

Tribunal that the Claimants’ arguments as to damages were

strictly limited to ones founded on the expropriation; that

these were not relevant to the claims for denial of justice and

discrimination; and that the Claimants had not produced any

convincing proof of damage in respect of these claims.*°
The Applicants allege that the Tribunal’s statement in paragraph 229 distorts the meaning
of paragraph 261 of the First Annulment Decision.°°? This Committee has studied and

compared both paragraphs. It has not found a distortion but an almost literal reproduction.

In the end, and as explained in detail in the preceding Section, the Resubmission Tribunal
found that the Applicants had been given a full opportunity to prove their injury and
damage caused by the violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard and that they
failed to present evidence to prove such a claim. This finding does not contradict any res

iudicata effect of the sections of the First Award which were not annulled.

Therefore, of the two cumulative limbs necessary to ascertain an excess of powers by not
granting monetary compensation, in contradiction to the First Tribunal’s res iudicata
findings, one limb does not exist to support the request. Even if the Committee had found
an annullable error in the Resubmission Tribunal’s definition of the term “compensation”
and not only a non-annullable misapplication, such finding would have no bearing on the
result of the proceeding, since the Applicants have not satisfied the criteria of the second

limb, i.e. their burden to prove the financially assessable damage.

As a result, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ assertion that the Resubmission Tribunal
exceeded its powers when it denied the claim for alleged damages for a violation of the

Respondent’s duty to guarantee fair and equitable treatment.

(2) A Serious Departure from a fundamental rule of procedure

The Applicants allege that the Resubmission Tribunal disrespected the res iudicata effect
of the First Award and distorted the First Award and the First Annulment Decision in order
to serve the Respondent’s interests, that it systematically sided with the Respondent to
avoid an order to oblige it to pay financial compensation, and that, generally, it has acted
in bad faith. They argue this systematic bias in favour of the Respondent represents a
departure from the most fundamental rule of procedure, i.e. the obligation to treat parties

neutrally and equally.

The Committee has found that the Resubmission Tribunal did not exceed its powers.
Beyond the repeated expression of suspicion with regard to the Tribunal’s intentions, the

Applicants have neither substantiated nor proved their allegations.

Therefore, the Committee is unable to discern bias and partiality on the part of the

Resubmission Tribunal and thereby a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.
(3) A failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based

The Resubmission Tribunal opens the Section on its Analysis with a detailed description
of its role where it summarises the major findings of the First Tribunal and the First

Committee, situates its task in this frame and asserts that it is aware that transgressing the

frame and the res iudicata findings would be a manifest excess of power.**

It then presents the Applicants’ request for relief by referring to their financial expert, as

well as the controversy between the Parties with respect to the admissibility of the claim.*°°

After an excursus on the status of Decree No. 165, which was very much in the Parties’

focus, and a detailed discussion on the concept of compensation, which has been

addressed in the preceding part of this Decision,*°”

the Tribunal devoted some thirty
paragraphs to the crucial issue of the burden of proof, first by setting out the standard and
then by applying the standard to the facts of the case. It regularly re-assured itself that it

moved its reasoning within the frame of res iudicata.

The Committee has no vocation to criticise the quality of or to express its agreement with
the reasoning. However, it does not hesitate to confirm that it was able to follow the

reasoning and did not find it frivolous.

However, the Committee has considered whether there is a contradiction between
paragraphs 196 and 232-233 of the Resubmission Award with respect to the consideration

of evidence and burden of proof.

Paragraph 196 of the Resubmission Award follows up on the Resubmission Tribunal’s
reasoning at paragraph 195 that the res iudicata effect of the First Award seems “to put an
insuperable obstacle in the way of the Claimants now advancing a claim to damage which
in its essence goes back to that original dispossession, by using the value of the then-
expropriated property as its central element.” In summarising the Applicants’ answer
thereto at paragraph 196, the Resubmission Award contains a concise but specific and clear
presentation of the Applicants’ position regarding its damage, which they understood as
being caused by a loss of opportunity. More specifically, the Resubmission Award

summarises the Applicants’ position as being that:

[T]he central consequence of the denial of justice found by
the First Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the
proceedings before the Santiago court over the Goss press,
was that they (the Claimants) were disabled from invoking a
conclusive argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely
null (ex func) and as such incapable of producing any legal
effects. Had they been in a position to do so, the argument
continues, they (the Claimants) would either have been able
to recover their confiscated property in Chile, or at the least
would have been able to establish before the First Tribunal
that the expropriation of this property was not an

713.

instantaneous act taking final effect in 1975, but was not in

fact completed until many years later, and the result of that

would have been that the expropriation did indeed fall under

the jurisdiction of the First Tribunal under the BIT, contrary

to the findings in the First Award. From this it follows, so

the Claimants’ argument concludes, that the loss suffered by

them arising out of the denial of justice is the loss of that

right to compensation in the original arbitration, so that such

loss is the one they can now claim in the present

proceedings. °°
Paragraphs 232 and 233 conclude that the Applicants failed to discharge their burden of
proof with regard to the injury, the damage and the quantification of damage and that “in
some senses they have not even set out to do so in as much as they have focussed their
submissions on the evaluation of damage, without undertaking the prior step of showing

the precise nature of the injury, causation and damage itself.”
The Applicants qualified these two presentations on proof of damage as “inconsistent.”

The Committee has to determine whether they are contradictory in a sense that they
neutralise each other or “cancel each other out.” Inconsistency and error are not enough to

warrant an annulment.

The Committee has come to the conclusion that there is no contradiction. Paragraph 196
summarises the Applicants’ position with respect to the evidence on injury and damages
resulting from the confiscation and its possible transplant to unfair and unequitable
treatment. In paragraphs 232 and 233, the Resubmission Tribunal analyses whether the
Applicants have effectively met their burden of proof, as announced in paragraph 231,

which introduces the Chapter.

The Resubmission Tribunal’s statement at paragraph 232 that the Applicants failed to set
out their damage does not imply that the Resubmission Tribunal did not consider or answer

the Applicants’ position as summarised at paragraph 196. This position of the Applicants

was addressed in detail in Section H of the Resubmission Award, which is situated between
paragraphs 196 and 232, and where the Resubmission Tribunal analyses the scope of the
First Award’s res iudicata effect. As already mentioned in paragraphs 661-672 above, the
Resubmission Tribunal finds that it has been decided with res iudicata effect that the
damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard cannot be based
on the value of expropriated assets. In paragraph 230, which is the penultimate paragraph
of Section H, the Resubmission Tribunal thus concludes that the “consequence of this
interpretation of the First Award is, in the opinion of the Tribunal, as follows: [...] d) that
any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is inconsistent
with the First Award and must therefore be rejected.” The Resubmission Tribunal then
pursues in paragraph 231 that the remaining question is “whether, and to what extent, the
Claimants have met that burden of proving what injury was caused to either or both of them
by the Respondent’s breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in the BIT, and
then of establishing the corresponding assessable damage in financial terms.” The
Resubmission Tribunal’s reasons taken as a whole are thus to the effect that (i) the
Applicants assert that the damage caused by the violation of the fair and equitable treatment
standard must be calculated on the basis of the expropriated assets; (ii) the First Tribunal
has found with res iudicata effect that this cannot be done; and therefore (iii) the Applicants
have “not even set out” to establish their damage within the limits set by the First Award’s
res iudicata effect. This nuance to the Resubmission Tribunal’s statement in paragraph 232
of the Resubmission Award is implicit but certain in the light of the reasons in the preceding

Section H.

The Committee therefore concludes that the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail to state the

reasons on which it based its Award.

For these reasons, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ request to annul the Award for

having failed to give res iudicata effect to the First Tribunal’s unannulled findings.

THE RESUBMISSION TRIBUNAL’S FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW IN THE

RESUBMISSION AWARD

With respect to moral damages, the Resubmission Tribunal did not deny that international
arbitration tribunals are competent to award compensation for moral damages. Therefore,
as a matter of principle, its position is in line with the Applicants’ assertion, the authorities

presented by them, and the First Tribunal.>!°

It excluded a limine a claim for moral damages of the second Applicant, the Foundation
President Allende, because “no attempt was made to advance, or to justify, a specific claim
that moral damage had been suffered by the Foundation.”*!! The Committee sees no error

in this.

As to the claim of Mr. Pey Casado, the Resubmission Tribunal found that he bore the
burden, under international law, to prove his moral damage and that he had failed to meet
this burden. This finding echoes the First Tribunal’s finding in paragraph 704 of the First
Award. The Resubmission Tribunal presents this finding as its own position “on the basis
of the written and oral submissions made to it by the Claimants,” and refers to paragraph
704 being aware that it figures in the annulled Section of the First Award, “but, as they
relate to matters of factual evidence and proof, they are not tainted by the criticisms of the

ad hoc Committee relating to the assessment of material damages.”>!?

The Applicants contend that the Resubmission Tribunal should have applied Chilean court
practice, which exempts damaged persons from the burden of proof. The Committee does
not agree. Where reparation is due for a violation of international law, there is no need to
determine reparation pursuant to the domestic law of the host State and its courts’ practice

in that respect. Violations of the BIT trigger responsibility under international law and give

51 First Award, para. 704. Although sitting in the annulled Section of the Award, the statement of principle may be
referred to, particularly since no consequence follows from there.

rise to reparation under international law. Chilean court practice is not relevant for the rules

on evidence for a claim under international law.

Contrary to what the Applicants’ argue,*'*

this remains unaffected by the fact that the
reparation concerned is for a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard and a
denial of justice by the Chilean domestic courts and in the Chilean domestic legal system.
First, when it comes to determining the damage caused by a denial of justice and a breach
of fair and equitable treatment by reference to the reparation the investor could, absent
these violations, have obtained in the domestic legal system, the rules of domestic law
determining that reparation are not part of the law applicable by the ICSID tribunal. They
are part of the minor of the legal syllogism, that is, they are part of the facts to which the
relevant rule of international law must be applied, and in the same way as a domestic law
is a fact when it comes to determining whether it is compatible with the state’s international
obligations. Second, the Applicants cannot claim moral damages by reference to what they
could have obtained in the Chilean domestic legal system, because there is no evidence
that the relevant Chilean proceedings were ever concerned with moral damages. The
Chilean court proceedings that were delayed in violation of the prohibition of denial of
justice were concerned with the restitution of the Goss Press, reparation of possible
damages to the press and lucrum cessans.>'+ Decision No. 43 granted third parties
compensation for the expropriation of El Clarin without there being question of moral
damages.*!> Accordingly, absent the denial of justice and the violation of fair and equitable
treatment, the Applicants would still not have obtained any moral damages in the Chilean
legal system. As a consequence, the Applicants’ argument is also based on a wrong factual

assumption.

Further, the Applicants criticise the Resubmission Tribunal for not having applied Article
31(2) of the Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that moral damage may be

compensated even if no material damage is present.

However, it is only after having found that “the claim to moral damages must be [...]
rejected” for want of proof,*!® that the Resubmission Tribunal discussed, in the conditional,
what would have happened if the claim for material damages had been proven and the
claim for moral damages had been made out. It speculates what it might have done under
such hypothetical circumstances. The Committee has no authority to make a judgment on
such speculation. However, it could not possibly give rise to an annullable error, since it

was obiter and thus left the Award unaffected.

Therefore, the Committee does not find that the Resubmission Tribunal exceeded its
powers when it rejected a claim for moral damages. It rejects the Applicants’ claim to annul
paragraph 243 of the Resubmission Award without further inquiry as to whether the

Applicants abandoned it, as alleged by the Respondent.

With respect to the alleged claim for unjust enrichment, the Resubmission Tribunal
explained that the First Tribunal adjudicated the Applicants’ claim for compensation based
on violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and that this is as much res
iudicata as its “definitive rejection of all the Claimants’ claims in the dispute other than
those covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 of the dispositive part of the First Award.”>!” The
Resubmission Tribunal further considered that the Applicants’ claim for unjust enrichment
could be interpreted in two ways, both of which were incompatible with the First Award’s
res iudicata effect. According to a first approach, the unjust enrichment claim amounted to
bringing a claim disconnected from any violation of the BIT, which was incompatible with
the First Award’s res iudicata effect of granting compensation only for the denial of justice

and the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.*!* According to a second

727.

approach, the unjust enrichment claim was a means of calculating damages for a right to
compensation established by other means, by reference to the value of the confiscated
assets and lost profits. In that case, the Resubmission Tribunal considered, this amounted

to “reintroducing under another guise the precluded expropriation claim.”>!°

It follows that the Applicants err in criticizing the Resubmission Tribunal for not having
applied the law applicable to unjust enrichment, namely general international law which is
part of the law applicable pursuant to Article 10(4) of the BIT. The Resubmission Tribunal
rejected the Applicants’ claim on the basis of the First Award’s res iudicata effect. It was
therefore not authorised to apply the doctrine of unjust enrichment pursuant to the law
applicable to it. The Applicants’ request for annulment based on the non-application of the

applicable law therefore fails.

In addition, the Committee finds that the Resubmission Tribunal thereby correctly
interpreted and respected the First Award’s res iudicata effect. To the extent that the unjust
enrichment claim was detached from any violation of the BIT, it could not be decided upon
by the Resubmission Tribunal whose powers were limited by paragraphs 2 and 3 of the
First Award’s dispositif. To the extent that the unjust enrichment claim was not detached
from any violation of the BIT, and to the extent that it triggered a calculation based on the
value of the expropriated assets and lost profits, it was precluded either by the res iudicata
finding that expropriation fell outside the temporal scope of application of the BIT, or by
the res iudicata finding that damages caused by the violation of fair and equitable treatment
could not be calculated by reference to the expropriated assets. Contrary to what the

520

Applicants assert,’ this was not a misinterpretation of the Applicants’ thesis but a correct

analysis of its ambit and implications.

Therefore, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ request to annul Section K of the
Resubmission Award without further inquiry into whether the Applicants abandoned it, as

alleged by the Respondent.

THE DISMISSAL OF THE RESTITUTION CLAIM FOR DAMAGES SUFFERED DUE TO THE

DEFENSE OF THE INVESTMENT AND THE ACCESS TO ARBITRATION

The Committee rejects the Applicants’ request for procedural reasons, as well as on the

merits.

It agrees with the Applicants that they were not obligated to submit a complete presentation
of their requests for annulment for the four grounds invoked with their application for
annulment. The time bar of 120 days after the date of the award does not hinder new

arguments from being developed in the course of the proceeding.

While this is uncontested, ad hoc committees are not exempt from analysing whether new
presentations represent new grounds for annulment, which would be precluded after 120
days after the award, or new elaborations on grounds which are already on file, which

would be admissible.

It is not enough to submit an annulment application copying Article 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention and leave the arguments for a later stage. As unequivocally stipulated in ICSID
Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c), the application for annulment shall “state in detail [...] the
grounds on which it is based.” This wording clarifies that a simple listing of the reasons

invoked does not fulfil the requirements of a complete application.

The reason behind the time limit as well as for the quality requirement is to protect the
finality of the award. Finality is a central feature of the arbitration system. Parties are
accorded four months to conclude whether, in their view, the award is tainted by such
fundamental flaws that its maintenance endangers the integrity and propriety of the system.
They may be convinced that the totality of the award is tainted by such deficiencies or only
parts. They may define specific issues, topics and/or conduct, which violate the integrity
of the proceeding by an excess of power, a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
and/or the absence of reasons. These grounds for annulment have to be established for each

issue, topic and conduct separately.

195

733.

734.

735.

736.

737.

The other party and the ad hoc committee should be informed of the precise reasons which
motivate an applicant to question the integrity and propriety of the constitution of the
tribunal, the tribunal’s conduct and/or the outcome of the proceeding, early on. Therefore,
the detailed statement of grounds is not a purely procedural orientation without substantial

relevance. Rather, it sets the stage for the annulment proceeding.

That does not mean that the annulment application has to be a complete presentation of the
arguments. If so, the sequence referred to in ICSID Arbitration Rule 31 would be

superfluous. It is in this sense that the ad hoc committee in Wena v. Egypt reasoned:

The ICSID Convention thus does not preclude raising new

arguments which are related to a ground of annulment

invoked within the time limit fixed in the Convention. This

is of no harm to the opposing party, which is not requested

to answer the Request, but later only the first memorial of

the Applicant.>”!
The Wena committee considered the element of timeliness important but accepted that no
harm was to be expected as long as the arguments concerning previously invoked grounds
were introduced with the first memorial thus giving the opposing party an opportunity to

understand the motivation and react to the arguments.

In the present case, the Applicants presented conduct related to a number of well-defined
issues which to their conviction were tainted with serious and annullable flaws, such as the
Resubmission Tribunal’s treatment of evidence, of claims for unjust enrichment and moral
damages, the application of the applicable law, or the Decision on Rectification. It is
evident for the Committee that these issues were set out in the Annulment Application and
that nothing hindered the Applicants from complementing their initial arguments with

respect to the different issues at a later stage.

With respect to incidental expenses and costs, the situation is different.

First, contrary to the Wena case, as referred to above, the Applicants did not complement
the initial Annulment Application with fuller arguments in the Memorial on Annulment.
Rather, they introduced the topic only with the Reply on Annulment, although they were
fully aware of the problem from the beginning of the annulment proceeding, and nothing

in the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial existed to trigger a new awareness.

Second, the incidental costs issue is not a new argument in the context of a targeted conduct
of the Tribunal within the sphere of defined issues. Rather, it is a new issue referring to
specific conduct. A detailed statement in the sense of ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)
would have required presenting the conduct and the issue early on, in order to establish the
framework for the annulment request. The Applicants had the duty to scrutinise the Award
and form their conviction as to what conduct, issues and topics were so entrenched with
errors that warranted annulment. By informing the Respondent, the Centre and the ad hoc
Committee of these issues and topics, they stated implicitly that the other conduct, issues

and topics were not tainted by annullable error and were to be considered final.

Nothing would have hindered the Applicants from complementing their initial arguments
by more elaborate ones, once the framework was established in the initial application.

Conversely, it was untimely to introduce the topic only with the Reply on Annulment.

For this procedural reason, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ request for annulment

for the Tribunal’s treatment of incidental costs as untimely.

Further, the Committee finds that the Resubmission Tribunal did not violate its duty to
state the reasons for the rejection of “all other claims” (paragraph 256(8) — Decision of the

Resubmission Award), including the claim for incidental costs.

As presented by the Applicants, the claim for incidental costs was connected to their claim

under Article 4 of the BIT, for violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard.

Indeed, such expenses and costs are closely related and connected to the primary claim for

compensation of damages resulting from violations of duties under Article 4 of the BIT.

They arise, in the words of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, “directly out of the subject-

matter of the dispute.”

The Resubmission Tribunal correctly determined that the res iudicata cost decisions of the
First Tribunal and the First Committee did not enter into the realm of its authority. With
respect to the financial compensation, it had decided that the Respondent did not owe the
Applicants any, and that “it cannot therefore, in principle, make any award of damages”*”?
for the principal claim. It had further decided that it “will make no further order as to costs,”

in addition to the costs of the arbitration.*73

In the Committee’s mind, there is no doubt that the Resubmission Tribunal considered the
claim for incidental costs as contingent on the original claim, and that the dismissal of the
second claim implied the dismissal of the first, and that no specific cost decision was

appropriate.

The Applicants allege that the Tribunal did not respect Article 48(3) of the ICSID
Convention when it did not address the claim for incidental costs. However, the Committee
agrees with Professor Schreuer who explains that “[i]f an argument rests on premises that
have been dismissed by the tribunal, the argument need not be addressed as long as the
tribunal has stated reasons for dismissing the premises.”**4 Applied to the situation in the
present case, the Committee finds that since the original claim was dismissed and reasons
are stated, the dismissal of the claim for consecutive damages and the reasons for it can be
deduced as being implied in the dismissal of the principal claim. The reasoning in toto is

understandable and does not warrant annulment for lack of reasons.

In light of this result, the Resubmission Tribunal was under no procedural obligation to
consider the documents evidencing the amount of the costs, because it had decided that the

Applicants had no claim in principle. The fact that this result favours the Respondent does

not allow for the assumption of the existence of partiality. The Respondent has not provided

substantiated reasons that would lead to a different result.

Therefore, the requests for annulment of the Resubmission Award for lack of reasons and
a departure from a rule of procedure in the treatment of “dommages consécutifs” or

incidental damages are rejected.

THE DECISION ON THE STATUS OF MS. CORAL PEY GREBE IN THE RESUBMISSION

PROCEEDING

The Applicants did not introduce the issue of Ms. Pey Grebe’s status and the grounds
warranting annulment of the Award in the context of this issue into the Annulment
Proceeding with the Annulment Application but only with the Memorial on Annulment of
27 April 2018. They have not explained why they failed to do so despite the fact that the
issue had been addressed prominently and in detail in Section III.B. of the Resubmission

Award.

In light of these circumstances, the Committee rejects the Applicants’ request to annul the
first paragraph of the dispositif and paragraphs 187-188 of the Resubmission Award for
manifest excess of powers, as requested in paragraph 753 of the Memorial on Annulment,
and for the additional grounds of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
and absence of reasons, as requested in paragraph 250 of the Reply on Annulment, and to
annul the whole Award for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
(partiality), as requested in paragraph 251 of the Reply on Annulment, both for procedural

reasons and on the merits.

With respect to procedural reasons, the Committee reiterates the arguments developed in

Chapter VIII-F. of this Decision.

The Applicants had the duty to establish the framework for the annulment proceeding by
stating, in detail, which circumstances, issues, conduct and topics warrant annulment and
on the basis of which grounds. Once done within the period of 120 days after the Award,

the Applicants were free to complete the application with new arguments.

199

754.

755.

756.

757.

758.

The Applicants chose not to introduce the issue of Ms. Pey Grebe’s status in a timely
manner, although they were aware of the Resubmission Tribunal’s conduct and
determination. No new information has come up to explain that choice. In accordance with
Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c), they failed to
present their conviction that the Resubmission Award was tainted by annullable errors in

this regard and have not validly questioned its finality.

Further, the Committee finds that the Resubmission Tribunal did not violate its duties in
any of the ways described in Article 52(1)(b), (d), and (e) of the ICSID Convention. The
Resubmission Tribunal exercised its powers in accordance with its interpretation of the
ICSID Convention. The interpretation might be contested but the Committee has no

authority to judge what interpretation is correct or preferable.

In paragraphs 43-48, 125-130 and 185-186 the Resubmission Tribunal summarised the
Parties’ positions on the status of Ms. Pey Grebe, and in paragraphs 187-188 it developed

its analysis and determination on the subject-matter.

Contrary to the Applicants’ assertion, the Resubmission Tribunal did not deny that Mr. Pey
Casado validly assigned his shares to Ms. Pey Grebe. It also did not deny the validity of
the assignment of shares to the Foundation President Allende or its status of investor and

Party in the arbitration proceeding.

Contrary to the Respondent’s position, and in line with the First Tribunal’s determination
as confirmed by the First Committee, the Resubmission Tribunal held, that the
expropriation of 1973-1975 had no effect on the transferability of the shares for the
purposes of the arbitration proceeding, neither for the transfer of shares to the Foundation

President Allende in 1990 nor for the transfer of shares to Ms. Pey Grebe in 2013:

[T]here is no dispute between the two sides that there has
been a cession of rights, in good faith, between Mr Pey
Casado and his daughter, which has been made for good
reason, or that both the cession itself and the reason for it

200

759.

760.

761.

762.

 

were disclosed to the Tribunal, as they had been to the First

Tribunal at an earlier stage.>”°
Further and again contrary to the Applicants’ assertion, the Resubmission Tribunal did not
re-discuss the nationality requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. It indeed
stated its conviction that “a new claimant party cannot simply freeload on the back of
jurisdictional claims of others [...] evading the jurisdictional requirements of [...] the

ICSID Convention.”°”°

The Applicants seem to interpret this statement as an indication that the Resubmission
Tribunal wanted to question the fulfilment of the nationality requirement of Ms. Pey Grebe.

If that were the case, they would have failed to read the sentence that follows immediately

the sentence quoted. The Resubmission Tribunal stated: “[t]hat is not the case here,”°?7

meaning that the jurisdictional requirements for Ms. Pey Grebe need not be examined

because they were irrelevant for the ongoing proceeding.

The Resubmission Tribunal came to this conclusion after having examined the scope of
the Resubmission Proceeding in interpreting Articles 52(6) and 53(1) of the ICSID

Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3)°** and finding that “the present proceedings

are a continuation of the original arbitration.”*°

The Tribunal deduced that:

The jurisdictional link as between Mr Pey Casado and the
Foundation, and the Republic of Chile, has been definitively
established by the First Award, and is res judicata; those
persons or entities continue to be the Parties under whose
name the present proceedings are conducted.**”

766.

This reasoning is consistent. It does not deny Ms. Pey Grebe’s status as an investor after
the assignment and it does not refer to nationality requirements. Rather, it determines that
she cannot substitute Mr. Pey Casado in the Resubmission Proceeding. It focuses its
analysis on the quality of the parties that initiated the proceeding in 1997 and conducted
them through the original arbitration and the first annulment phases, and it considers

decisive that these parties must remain parties in the resubmission phase.

The Resubmission Tribunal applied Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention in its literal and
ordinary meaning, as explained in Schreuer’s Commentary:

Submission to a new tribunal is in respect of “the dispute”.

This means that the parties to the resubmitted proceeding

must be the same parties as in the original proceeding. [...]

[P]roblems may arise if there is a change of corporate

structure, assignment of rights or a dissolution of a corporate

investor.>*!
Therefore, the Resubmission Tribunal not only exercised its authority when not admitting
Ms. Pey Grebe as one of the Claimants, but it also exercised this authority in application
of the applicable law, i.e. the ICSID Convention. The Committee has no power to analyse

whether the application is erroneous.

The result of the Resubmission Tribunal’s determination is that Ms. Pey Grebe cannot be
considered a Claimant in the proceeding as a consequence of the assignment of shares.
That is a specific ruling, which is not correctly characterised by the Applicants’ generic
suggestion that she is in “legal limbo” and that the Resubmission Tribunal blocked her
access to and protection by international arbitration. For the present proceeding, the
Resubmission Tribunal indicated that harm was not unavoidable in the circumstances,
because she was able to influence the proceeding as mandated by her father in cooperation

with counsel and that possible proceeds could be shared by an “internal arrangement.”>*?

Further, the Resubmission Tribunal stated the reasons for its determination by first
recapitulating the Parties’ position and then presenting its own analysis. Unlike what the
Applicants assert, this is no “ex cathedra’” assertion but an application of Article 52 of the
ICSID Convention, which has the advantage of corresponding to its ordinary meaning.
Again, the Committee will refrain from analysing whether the reasons are adequate or not.
It concludes that the Resubmission Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons on which it

based the decision not to admit Ms. Pey Grebe as co-Claimant.

The Resubmission Tribunal’s reasons are not contradictory. The Applicants submit that it
mused over the internal distribution of financial compensation between Mr. Pey Casado
and Ms. Pey Grebe, only to dismiss the claim for financial compensation at a later stage.
These two statements do not neutralise each other. The first one addresses an eventuality
of financial compensation and considers its possible distribution. The second one decides
on the reality of the rejection of financial compensation. Therefore, both statements are

concerned with different matters and cannot cancel each other out.

The Applicants further contend that the Tribunal exceeded it powers by disrespecting the
First Tribunal’s res iudicata finding that the assignment of shares and rights had been

effective and had founded the quality of co-Claimant in the proceedings.

The Applicants refer to the assignment of rights to the Foundation President Allende.

However, the reference and the reasoning are inapposite in the context of the assignment
of rights to Ms. Pey Grebe. They confuse the substantive validity of the assignment, which
is not questioned by the Resubmission Tribunal, with the procedural issue of change of

parties, which is questioned.

The latter issue did not exist in the initial phase. Mr. Pey Casado had transferred a part of
his shares to the Foundation in 1990. They both initiated the arbitration proceeding in 1997.
Once the question of a valid assignment of expropriated shares resolved in favour of the

Claimants — as done by the First Tribunal, confirmed by the First Committee (and accepted

203

773.

774.

775.

776.

777.

as res iudicata by the Resubmission Tribunal) — there was no doubt that the Foundation

could be a co-Claimant.

Obviously, the First Award of 8 May 2008 was not called upon to and could not make any
res iudicata determination on the procedural status of Ms. Pey Grebe based on the transfer

of shares in 2013. A res iudicata effect does not extend by analogy to future events.

This is all the more so since the circumstances are not comparable. The standing of the
Foundation resulted from its ownership of shares acquired some seven years before the
dispute was brought to arbitration, whereas Ms. Pey Grebe’s acquisition of ownership post-
dates the initiation of the proceeding by some 16 years, and the case had been pending with
identical Parties for this period. No res iudicata effect hindered the Resubmission Tribunal
from deciding an issue differently from a decision of the First Tribunal which concerned a

different issue.

In addition, and again contrary to the Applicants’ assertion, the Tribunal has not imposed
Ms. Pey Grebe as new counsel on the Applicants and even less replaced Dr. Garcés by her.
The Applicants confuse the procedural power of attorney and the mandate under

substantive law.

The lack of the Tribunal’s intention in this direction is well documented in the
Resubmission Award. On the cover page, the Tribunal lists Dr. Garcés as the only
representative of the Applicants, in cooperation with others, among whom Ms. Pey Grebe
does not figure. In paragraph 35 of the Award, Ms. Pey Grebe is mentioned as representing

the Foundation.

Instead, the intention of the Resubmission Tribunal was to define a place for Ms. Pey Grebe
in proceedings in which she had had an active role. As set out in paragraph 187 of the
Resubmission Award, the Resubmission Tribunal considered that “the substance of the
arrangements in their actual operation is that Ms Pey Grebe, the daughter, acts in practice
as the legal representative of her aged father,” which the Resubmission Tribunal clarified

as meaning that “counsel for the Claimants were in practice taking detailed instructions

204

72.

779.

780.

781.

from Ms Pey Grebe on her father’s behalf, rather than from Mr Pey Casado in person.” In
other words, the Resubmission Tribunal did not regard Ms Pey Grebe as acting in lieu of
Dr. Garcés, but as acting in lieu of her father in instructing Dr. Garcés and also “for all
purposes relating to the award of such compensation.” This was also confirmed by the
Applicants. In their letter of 12 October 2018 addressed to the Centre, they wrote in the
context of the continuation of the proceeding after Mr. Pey Casado’s death that Ms. Pey
Grebe has instructed counsel — as the Foundation had done before — that the proceeding
should continue. That is an unequivocal statement in the sense that they wanted a defined
role for her, in case she was not admitted as party, and that this role would consist in her

instructing counsel as her father had done originally.

It follows that the Resubmission Tribunal did not impose a new counsel on Mr. Pey Casado
and did not replace Dr. Garcés with Ms. Pey Grebe. Accordingly, the Applicants’ allegation
that the Resubmission Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure has no

factual basis.

Finally, in paragraph 251 of their Reply on Annulment, the Applicants vaguely associate
the two assertions of an excess of powers and the failure to present reasons to allege that
they evidence a manifest partiality. The Applicants did not substantiate the allegation. The
Committee is therefore unable to enter into a deeper analysis of the allegation and has to

reject the request for annulment for manifest partiality.

In sum, the Applicants’ requests for annulment of parts and/or the totality of the
Resubmission Award with respect to the issue of Ms. Pey Grebe’s status in the proceeding

fail for procedural and substantive reasons.
THE FINDING ON COSTS IN THE RECTIFICATION DECISION

It is uncontroversial that tribunals have broad discretion to determine, in accordance with
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), “how and by

whom” the expenses and costs of ICSID, the tribunal and parties are borne. Discretion does

533 Resubmission Award, para. 188.

783.

785.

786.

not imply complete freedom. It must be based on retraceable rationality and not be

exercised arbitrarily.

Although based on discretion, a decision on costs is part of an award. The duty to state

reasons for the decision extends to it.

With respect to this principle, the Committee agrees with the Applicants. It has to examine

whether these criteria are met in the present case.

In its decision on costs for the Resubmission Proceeding, the Tribunal concluded that “as
a general principle, a successful litigant [...] ought to be protected against the cost and
expense of having to litigate.”*™* Still, and in accordance with the First Tribunal, it took
additional circumstances into account, including the general conduct of the Parties. As a
result, it split the arbitration costs between the Parties although it recognised that the
Respondent had prevailed. An important reason for the Resubmission Tribunal was that
“the Claimants had good reasons to bring the resubmission proceedings as such.”>*> No
resistance was voiced by the Respondent or by the Applicants, in whose partial favour the

Resubmission Tribunal had decided.

In its Rectification Decision, the Tribunal stated that it “can see no good reason why the

same principle should not apply” for the rectification proceeding.**°

In applying the principle, the Resubmission Tribunal outlined the procedural history of the
rectification proceeding. The proceeding had taken almost one year and was punctuated by
the Applicants’ requests for suspension linked to repeated requests for document
production and their request for discontinuance, as well as suspensions due to the
Applicants’ repeated proposals to disqualify President Berman and Mr. Veeder. Both of

these proposals were rejected by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.

787.

789.

790.

791.

The Tribunal found that the different requests and proposals had no connection to the
rectification proceeding and decided that they “will not be further considered in the present

Decision except in relation to the allocation of costs.”°>7

The Resubmission Tribunal rectified four errors in the Resubmission Award, partly in
response to the Applicants’ proposals, partly in response to the Respondent’s proposal. It
found that three of them are “of purely formal import,” and that in any event none of them
had “any perceptible impact on the meaning or effect of the Resubmission Award as
such.”°*8 The Committee reviewed the rectifications and has no reason to object to the

Resubmission Tribunal’s appreciation.

The Resubmission Tribunal took “these factors into account”>??

and recalled the principle
that good reasons should exist to bring issues before a tribunal and unnecessary costs
should be avoided. It concluded that taken together, the factors justified a cost decision to
exempt the Respondent from any expenses and costs and to place the burden on the

Applicants.

These are considerations and reasons stated to explain the non-arbitrariness of the cost

decision.

It would have been for the Applicants to explain why this line of reasoning and
determination amounted to a manifest excess of power and/or a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure, and in what way paragraphs 56-58 of the Rectification
Decision, in conjunction with paragraphs 249-251 of the Resubmission Award, can be
equated to an absence of reasons. They have failed to do so. Neither paragraph 280 of the
Annulment Application nor paragraph 757 of the Memorial on Annulment contain any

substantiation to this end.

2.

In any event, the Resubmission Tribunal’s Decision does not contradict the principle
formulated in paragraph 249 of the Resubmission Award. The Resubmission Tribunal did
not state, in paragraph 56 of the Rectification Decision, that it would apply the same
allocation key as the one applied in the Resubmission Award. Instead, it stated that it would
apply the same principles as for the allocation of costs in proceedings on the merits. These
principles, enunciated in paragraphs 249 and 251 of the Resubmission Award, were that
“as a general principle, a successful litigant, whether claimant or respondent, ought to be
protected against the cost and expense of having to litigate” so that costs are allocated
depending on the extent to which a party won or lost. This is what the Resubmission
Tribunal did in its Rectification Decision, in allocating the costs against the Applicants
because they failed in their challenges against Messrs. Berman and Veeder and the errors

were devoid of practical relevance.

Therefore, the request to annul paragraphs 58, 61 and 62(b) of the Rectification Decision

is rejected.

802. The above costs have been paid out of the advances made pursuant to ICSID

Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e). The remaining balance will be

reimbursed to the Applicants.

803. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides, in its relevant part, that:

The Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree,
assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom
those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the

Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid.

Under this provision, applicable to this Annulment Proceeding by virtue of Article 52(4)
of the ICSID Convention, the Committee has broad discretion in allocating the costs of the

proceeding and the Parties’ legal costs and expenses.

The Committee finds it appropriate to follow, in a broad brush, mutatis mutandis, the

approaches of the two Tribunals as well as the consideration of the First Committee.

The Tribunals had applied the widely accepted principle that costs should follow the event
by at the same time taking into account the specific circumstances of the case and the
conduct of the Parties. The ad hoc Committee had recalled that “[i]n most of the decisions
of annulment committees, the committees have decided that each party should bear its own
litigation costs and that the costs of the proceeding should be borne equally by the parties”

and had seen no reason “to depart from the prevailing practice.”**!

Of course, the circumstances of the second annulment proceeding are specific and the result

is not fully comparable to the previous phases and decisions.

It is true that the Applicants’ Request for Annulment is rejected. At the same time, the
application was far from frivolous, superficial or tainted by extraneous considerations.
They had good reason to have an ad hoc committee scrutinise whether the Tribunal was
properly constituted, whether the Award did not suffer from fundamental defects, whether
the suspicion of bias had a basis in reality, and whether the propriety and integrity of the
procedure were respected. In that respect, the remedy of annulment is important to

guarantee the legitimacy and acceptability of the ICSID arbitration system.

The Committee has found that in the present case the Tribunal, the arbitrators’ conduct and
the Award were free from such flaws. Both Parties have greatly assisted the Committee to

reach its conclusions, each one in its specific style and manner.

212

810.

811.

812.

813.

Taken together, the Committee believes that it is fair to complement the “cost follow the
event” principle by another principle of cost allocation according to which “costs lie where

they fall.”

Both principles reinforce each other under the present circumstances: In accordance with
ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e) the Applicants have advanced the

costs of the proceeding, and the Parties have paid the legal costs and expenses.

The Committee decides that all costs and expenses should lie where they fall, meaning that
the costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee and the costs
of the Centre are finally paid out of the advances made by the Applicants, and that each

Party bears its own legal fees and expenses.
