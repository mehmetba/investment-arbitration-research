THE TREATY

Art. 11 of the Treaty regulates the settlement of disputes between a Party and an
investor of the other Party to the Treaty:?

“(1) If an investor of a Party considers that a measure applied by the other
Party is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus causing loss
or damage to him or his investment, he may request consultations with a view
to resolving the matter amicably.

(2) Any such matter which has not been settled within a period of six months
from the date of the written request for consultations may be referred to the
courts or administrative tribunals of the Party concerned or to international
arbitration. In the latter event the investor has the choice between either of the
following:

(a) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
provided for by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at
Washington on March 18, 1965; and

2 Doc. C-6.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

(b) an ad-hoc arbitral tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed upon by the
parties to the dispute, shall be established under the arbitration rules of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

(3) Each Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to the
submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in accordance
with paragraph 2 above, except for disputes with regard to Article 10
paragraph 2 of this Agreement.

(4) Once the investor has referred the dispute to either a national tribunal or
any of the international arbitration mechanisms provided for in paragraph 2
above, the choice of the procedure shall be final.

(5) An investor may not submit a dispute for resolution according to this
Article if more than five years have elapsed from the date the investor first
acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the events giving rise to the
dispute.

(6) The Party which is party to the dispute shall at no time whatsoever during
the process assert as a defence its immunity or the fact that the investor has
received, by virtue of an insurance contract, a compensation covering the
whole or part of the incurred damage.

(7) Neither Party shall pursue through diplomatic channels a dispute submitted
to international arbitration unless the other Party does not abide by and comply
with the arbitral award.

(8) The arbitral award shall be final and binding for the parties to the dispute

and shall be executed without delay according to the law of the Party
concerned.”

II, PROCEDURAL HISTORY

This proceeding has been riddled with procedural incidents. In order to present a
proper account of the history of this arbitration the Tribunal will first present a
chronology of the procedure (1.) and will then recount in detail the main procedural
incidents (2.).

(CHRONOLOGY OF THE PROCEDURE

On 4 March 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from
Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. against the Republic of
Colombia, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-66 [“Request”].

On 16 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Art. 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties
to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with
Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and
Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Art. 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one
to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by
agreement of the Parties.

On 4 May 2016, Claimants appointed Mr. Oscar M. Garibaldi, a national of the
United States of America as well as a national of the Argentine Republic, as
arbitrator in this case. Mr. Garibaldi accepted his appointment on 6 May 2016.

On 3 June 2016, Respondent appointed Mr. Christopher Thomas, a national of
Canada, as arbitrator in this case. Mr. Thomas accepted his appointment on 7 June
2016.

On 29 July 2016, the Parties appointed Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a national
of the Kingdom of Spain, as President of the Tribunal. Prof. Fernandez-Armesto
accepted his appointment on 3 August 2016.

On 4 August 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [“Arbitration Rules”],
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and
that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms.
Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary
of the Tribunal.

On 28 September 2016, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the

Tribunal held a first session and preliminary procedural consultation with the
Parties by teleconference [“First Session”].

Glencore International A.G. and C.1. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

On 4 November 2016, following the First Session, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the
decisions of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, inter
alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April
2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, that the place
of proceeding would be Washington, D.C., and that Mrs. Krystle M. Baptista would
act as Assistant to the Tribunal. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out three
procedural calendars envisaging three different scenarios for the written phase.

On 16 December 2016, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, together with:
- Witness Statements of:
o Mr. Gary Nagle
o Mr. Mark McManus
- Expert Report of Compass Lexecon
- Exhibits C-67 through C-184
- Legal Authorities CL-1 through CL-95

The submission was transmitted to Respondent and the Tribunal on 2 January 2017,
in accordance with paragraph 15.2 of Procedural Order No. 1.

On 2 February 2017, Respondent filed its Request for Bifurcation, together with
Exhibits R-1 through R-25, and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-34.

On 2 March 2017, Claimants filed their Response to Respondent’s Request for
Bifurcation, together with Exhibits C-185 through C-194, and Legal Authorities
CL-96 through CL-127.

On 3 April 2017, the Tribunal issued its decision on Respondent’s Request for
Bifurcation. The Tribunal decided not to bifurcate the proceedings, and to address
the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent together with the merits,
following the procedural calendar established as Scenario 3 in Procedural Order
No. 1.

On 17 July 2017, Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility
and Counter-Memorial, together with:

- Witness Statements of:
o Mr. Oscar Paredes
o Ms. Soraya Vargas
- Expert Report of Messrs. Frank Graves and John Dean of the Brattle Group,

Glencore International A.G. and C.1. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- Exhibits R-26 through R-203
- Legal Authorities RL-35 through RL-114

By letter of 26 July 2017, Claimants noted that 41 of the exhibits accompanying
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial were private and internal email chains exchanged
internally between Claimants’ management and their in-house and external counsel
[Disputed Documents”]. Claimants requested inter alia that the Tribunal order
Colombia to provide information regarding the time and manner in which these
documents had been obtained, as well as a full log of Prodeco’s private
communications, documents and data in possession of Colombia, its internal and
external counsel, and its witnesses and experts, indicating the chain of custody as
well as the dates of access. Claimants further requested an order “declaring
inadmissible all documents irregularly obtained or produced by Colombia in breach
of its duty of good faith and rules of privilege, and an order striking out any
statements in Colombia’s Counter-Memorial and/or witness statements and expert
report that rely on such documents.”

On 3 August 2017, Respondent submitted its response, together with Exhibits
R-204 through R-214, and Legal Authorities RL-115 through RL-120.
Respondent(i) explained that the Disputed Documents had been legally obtained by
the Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio [“SIC”] in the context of a
preliminary investigation into unfair practices by Prodeco and its affiliates and (ii)
requested that the Tribunal declare the Disputed Documents admissible.

By letter of 22 August 2017, Claimants’ submitted their reply to Respondent’s
letter, together with Exhibits C-195 through C-228, and slightly amended their
request for relief [“Claimants’ First Application”]. On 11 September 2017,
Respondent filed a rejoinder letter, reiterating its initial request.

On 20 September 2017, Claimants submitted a new letter [“Claimants’ Second
Application”) addressing the following issues:

- the filing on 11 September 2017 of a criminal complaint by the Agencia
Nacional de Defensa Juridica del Estado [“ANDJE”] with the office of the
Fiscalia General de la Nacioén requesting inter alia de deposition of two of
Claimants’ employees;

- the apparent leaking of the Disputed Documents to the Colombian press; and
Colombia’s intention to seek orders from the Tribunal for the production of
communications between Prodeco and its former external counsel as well as
an order compelling the latter to appear as a witness at the hearing.

Pending the Tribunal’s consideration of their first application, in Claimants’ Second
Application, they requested an urgent measure to protect the status quo.

On 2 October 2017, Respondent submitted its response to Claimants’ Second

Application, together with Exhibits R-214 through R-230, and Legal Authorities
RL-121 through RL-143, requesting that the Tribunal reject it.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

On 26 September 2017, following exchanges between the Parties, the Centre
transmitted the Parties’ respective requests for production of documents. On 11
October 2017, the Tribunal postponed its decision on the disputed document
production requests, pending the full review and deliberations on Claimants’
applications.

On 4 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, deciding inter
alia that the Disputed Documents should be excluded from the record of this
arbitration, directing Respondent to re-submit its Objections to Jurisdiction and
Admissibility and Counter-Memorial without attaching or referring to the Disputed
Documents, giving the Parties an opportunity to file new requests for document
production that would supersede and replace the original requests still pending
before the Tribunal, and proposing a new procedural calendar. The new procedural
calendar was agreed to by the Parties on 10 November 2017.

By letter of 14 November 2017, Respondent filed observations on Procedural Order
No. 2, together with Exhibits R-231 through R-235, and Legal Authorities RL-145
through RL-147. The Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent’s
letter in their Reply Memorial.

On 16 November 2017, Respondent filed its Amended Counter-Memorial on the
Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with:

- Amended Witness Statement of Mr. Oscar Paredes

- Amended Expert Report of Messrs. Frank Graves and John Dean of the
Brattle Group, together with Amended Exhibit BR-118

- New Exhibits R-236 and R-237

In accordance with the revised procedural calendar, on 14 December 2017, the
Parties submitted their respective requests for production of documents for decision
by the Tribunal, including the corresponding responses and replies thereto.

On 4 January 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning its
decision on the Parties’ request for production of documents in their respective
Redfern Schedules. On 11 January 2018, following a request by Claimants and
Respondent’s comments, the Tribunal granted Claimants an extension of time to
submit the documents subject to a production order under Procedural Order No. 3.
On 30 January 2018, Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits, together with:

- Second Witness Statements of:

o Mr. Gary Nagle

o Mr. Mark McManus

- Exhibits C-229 through C-294, and resubmitted Exhibits C-50, C-56, and
C-103

- Legal Authorities CL-127.1 through CL-149

On 23 February 2018, Respondent submitted a letter, together with Exhibits R-238
through R-240, asking the Tribunal inter alia:

- to order Claimants to produce unredacted copies of the documents that had
been produced in redacted form,

- to produce the documents included in the privilege log submitted by
Claimants with redactions only in the documents exchanged with external
counsel in the relevant portions where legal advice had been sought or given,

- to complete their production of documents in accordance with Procedural
Order No. 3 and to confirm as much.

On 2 March 2018, Claimants submitted their response to Respondent’s letter, in
which they requested that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent’s request of 23 February
2018, and confirmed that they had produced and/or logged all the documents in
their possession, custody or control responsive to the Tribunal’s orders and that they
would produce any other documents that might subsequently come into their
possession, custody or control.

On 6 March 2018, the Tribunal replied to the Parties’ communications of 23
February and 2 March 2018, stating that the challenge to the relevant documents
had to be done on a document-by-document basis and that the Tribunal could not
entertain Colombia’s general request for relief. In order to solve this incident in the
most efficient manner, the Tribunal suggested that the Parties confer and try to reach
an agreement on any disputed document. If an agreement could not be reached, the
Tribunal would resolve any requests on a document-by-document basis.

By letter of 9 March 2018, Respondent submitted comments on the Tribunal’s
decision and requested the Tribunal’s instructions to gather and marshal into the
record evidence collected from the SIC by the General Prosecutor in the context of
a domestic criminal investigation into the illegalities surrounding the Eighth
Amendment. By letter of 12 March 2018, Claimants submitted observations on the
Respondent’s letter, and asked the Tribunal to decline Respondent’s proposed
procedure to address its request.

On 17 March 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties instructing Respondent on the
steps to follow in order to gather the evidence collected by the General Prosecutor
and marshal it into the record, and recommending that the Parties try to reach an
agreement on the marshalling of all or a part of the documents before any
application was presented to the Tribunal.

Glencore International A.G. and C.1. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

On 26 March 2018, following communications from the Parties, the Tribunal
notified them of its decision to grant a 4-day extension to Respondent to submit its
Reply on Preliminary Objections and Rejoinder on the Merits, and stated that
Claimants would also be granted a 4-day extension of their deadline to present their
Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.

By letter of 27 March 2018, Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties’
inability to reach an agreement with regard to the production of the unredacted
documents and privilege log documents and, according to the Tribunal’s
communications of 6 and 17 March 2018, requested that the Tribunal order
Claimants to produce the documents included in its document-by-document
request, sent to Claimants on 12 March 2018.

On 2 April 2018, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on
Jurisdiction, together with:

- Second Witness Statements of:
o Mr. Oscar Paredes
o Ms. Soraya Vargas

- Second Expert Report of Messrs. Frank Graves of The Brattle Group, John
Dean of JD Energy and Landy Stinnet of FGM Consulting Group, Inc.,
together with Exhibits BR-125 through BR-190

- Exhibits R-241 through R-348
- Legal Authorities RL-148 through RL-186

By letter of 3 April 2018, Claimants submitted their observations on Respondent’s
letter of 27 March 2018 asking the Tribunal to reject Respondent’s request.

By letter of 20 April 2018, Claimants requested the Tribunal’s intervention
regarding a notice that Prodeco had received from the National Mining Agency
[“ANM”] stating that a commission composed of Colombia’s international external
counsel in this arbitration, Colombia’s economic experts, Colombia’s internal
counsel for this arbitration (ANDJE) and several ANM officers would visit the
Calenturitas mine between 30 April and 2 May 2018. Claimants alleged that the
visit had no bona fide regulatory purpose but was rather aimed at gathering
additional information for this arbitration, and requested that the Tribunal order
Colombia to refrain from imposing a unilateral site visit for the purposes of this
arbitration and to refrain from visiting the mine site without the Tribunal’s
authorization.

On 24 April 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the
production of the redacted documents and the privilege log documents initially
requested by Respondent in its communication of 23 February 2018. The Tribunal
determined inter alia that while Claimants had not strictly complied with the

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Tribunal’s instructions in Procedural Order No. 2 concerning privilege-based
objections, this departure from the established procedure had not caused
Respondent irreparable harm. As a consequence, the Tribunal decided not to
dismiss Claimants’ objections based on privilege in limine. As to the merits of the
objections, the Tribunal found that legal privilege extends not only to outside
counsel, but also to in-house lawyers and found no evidence suggesting that
Claimants had waived legal or, to the extent relevant, settlement privilege. The
Tribunal also directed Claimants’ lead counsel to submit an affidavit confirming
that each of the relevant documents met all of the privilege requirements identified
by the Tribunal in the order and to produce all the relevant documents that did not.
In light of the proximity of the hearing, the Tribunal also took the opportunity to
call a number of persons to testify as witnesses at the hearing.

On 25 April 2018, Respondent submitted its comments on Claimants’ letter
regarding the site visit and requested that the Tribunal reject Claimants’ allegations
and not to intervene in any way in relation to the visit planned to the Calenturitas
mine.

On 27 April 2018, the Tribunal issued its decision regarding the site visit. The
Tribunal found no reason to deny the visit, so long as the precise dates were properly
agreed between the Parties in order to facilitate Respondent’s access and minimize
the inconvenience to Claimants.

On 30 April 2018, and further to the Tribunal having called certain persons to testify
as witnesses at the hearing [Tribunal Witnesses”] in Procedural Order No. 4, the
Parties submitted an agreed proposal concerning those witnesses.

On 30 April 2018, Claimants’ lead counsel submitted a certification and affidavit
in accordance with Procedural Order No. 4 and produced, in unredacted form, the
documents that did not meet the privilege requirements established by the Tribunal
in the order. On 1 May 2018, the Parties agreed that Mr. Blackaby’s affidavit of 30
April 2018 should be submitted to the Tribunal without its annexes, pursuant to
Procedural Order No. 2.

On 4 May 2018, Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, together with:
- Third Witness Statement of Mr. Gary Nagle

- Exhibits C-295 through C-327, and resubmitted Exhibits C-90 and C-260

- Legal Authority CL-150

On 9 and 10 May 2018, respectively, the Parties confirmed the witnesses and
experts that they wished to cross-examine at the hearing.

On 11 May 2018, Claimants sought leave to include a technical report as a new
document into the record.

Glencore International A.G. and C.1. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

On 11 May 2018, Respondent requested that the documents that had been gathered
from the Fiscalia General de la Nacién [“FGN”] and filtered by Mr. Camilo Enciso
in accordance with the Tribunal’s directions be admitted into the record [“FGN
Documents”]. Respondent further referred to a list of documents in Annex A to
said communication [“Annex A Documents”] as responsive to Colombia’s
document production requests and not protected by either legal or settlement
privilege, and asked that the Tribunal review these documents, order Claimants to
produce them and admit them into the record. In the alternative, Respondent
indicated that it would not object to the Tribunal appointing a conflicts counsel to
analyse said documents.

On 14 May 2018, Claimants filed its response to Respondent’s 11 May request and
asked the Tribunal to deny the application to admit the FGN Documents as they did
not amount to evidence garnered by the Colombian criminal courts and/or because
Colombia had failed to demonstrate their relevance and materiality to the outcome
of the dispute. Claimants further requested that the Tribunal reject Colombia’s
request to admit the Annex A Documents as they were not responsive to its
document requests or were subject to legal or settlement privilege.

On 15 May 2018, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal elaborating on its 11 May
request concerning the FGN Documents and Annex A Documents and requesting
that the Tribunal reject Claimants’ 11 May application to include a new document
into the record. Claimants responded to this communication on 18 May 2018. On
the same day, Respondent submitted the memorandum sent to Mr. Enciso on 5 April
2018 in connection with the FGN Documents as well as Colombia’s communication
to Mr. Enciso of 3 May 2018.

On 14 May 2018, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the
Parties by telephone conference.

On 17 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the
organization of the hearing.

On 18 May 2018, the Tribunal notified the Parties regarding its decision not to
admit into the record any of the documents requested by the Parties and indicated
that a full decision would follow. In particular, the Tribunal declined to admit the
following documents: (i) the technical report identified by Claimants in their email
of 11 May 2018; (ii) the FGN Documents; and (iii) the Annex A Documents.

A hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held in Washington, D.C. from 28 May

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

On 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 containing its full
decision and reasoning on the admissibility of (i) the technical report identified by
Claimants in their email of 11 May 2018; (ii) the FGN Documents and (iii) the
Annex A Documents, as advanced in the Tribunal’s communication to the Parties
of 18 May 2018.

On 8 August 2018, the Parties filed a single round of simultaneous post-hearing
briefs together with their respective Legal Authorities RL-187 through RL-236 and
CL-151 through CL-173.

Further to the Tribunal’s confirmation of its costs instructions, the Parties submitted
a new agreement on the parameters of the costs submissions on 18 and 19
September 2018, and filed their respective costs submissions on 24 September
2018.

On 7 March 2019, the Tribunal asked Claimants to provide further information in
the interest of completeness and indicated when Respondent should file any
comments it might have to the data provided by Claimants. Claimants filed the
requested information on 14 March 2019.

Further to the Parties’ agreement of 26 June 2018 concerning, inter alia, the
language of the Award and to the Parties’ respective communications of 16 July
2019 noting their diverging interpretations thereof, on 30 July 2019, the Tribunal
decided that the Parties’ agreement of 26 June 2018 had superseded the relevant
provision in Procedural Order No. 1, such that the Award would be rendered in
English only and the Tribunal would request that the Centre prepare and deliver to
the Parties an official Spanish translation. The Tribunal clarified that “[fJor all
intents and purposes under the ICSID Convention and Rules, the date of dispatch
of the certified copies of the Award in English shall be the date when the Award is
deemed to have been rendered.” On 15 August 2019, the Tribunal declared the
proceeding closed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).

summarize the decision (B.) and will explain its consequences (C.). The Tribunal
will add a final section on the Parties’ comments to PO No. 2 (D.).

A. The Road to PO No. 2

The road to PO No. 2 began with Respondent’s request for an extension of the
deadline for filing its Counter-Memorial. Respondent’s Counter-Memorial was
scheduled to be filed not later than 3 July 2017.

On 7 June 2017, Respondent requested a one-month extension of the time limit to
submit the Counter-Memorial on account of:

- an administrative reorganization of Colombia’s State Attorney Office (ANDJE),
and

- health issues affecting counsel for Colombia.

After hearing Claimants, on 12 June 2017 the Arbitral Tribunal granted Respondent
a two-week extension to file its Counter-Memorial.

One day thereafter, on 13 June 2017, Colombia’s Antitrust Agency (SIC), the
administrative agency that enforces antitrust law in Colombia? and ANDJE, the
public agency in charge of the legal defense of the State and its agencies, signed an
agreement to exchange information [the “Cooperation Agreement”]:*

“PRIMERA, - OBJETO DEL CONVENIO: Aunar esfuerzos técnicos,
administrativos y de apoyo logistico entre la Agencia Nacional de Defensa
Juridica del Estado y la Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio para
contribuir de manera eficaz y oportuna en el intercambio de _informacién
relacionada con la defensa juridica de Colombia, de conformidad con las

competencias de cada entidad”. [Emphasis added]

In compliance with the Cooperation Agreement, at some unspecified date in June
or July 2017 the SIC delivered to ANDJE certain documents it had seized from
Prodeco three years earlier, in August 2014. At that time the SIC had raided
Prodeco’s premises in the context of a preliminary antitrust investigation relating
to Puerto Nuevo. Using its regulatory powers, the SIC seized certain documents>
and downloaded in bulk all the emails lodged in the computers of certain Prodeco
managers [the “Seized Emails”).

After delivery of the Seized Emails, ANDJE and/or counsel to the Republic
reviewed such documents, and identified certain documents unrelated to antitrust
matters, but allegedly relevant to the adjudication of the present dispute.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Submission of Respondent’s Counter-Memorial

On 17 July 2017, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial. Included amongst the
attached exhibits were some of the Seized Emails.

Ten days thereafter, on 26 July 2017, Claimants filed a submission in which they
averred that 41 of the exhibits were private and internal email chains exchanged
internally between Claimants’ management and their in-house and external counsel
[previously defined as the “Disputed Documents”]. In that submission, Claimants
requested inter alia that the Tribunal:

- Order Colombia to provide:

o information regarding the time and manner in which these documents
had been obtained,

o a full log of Prodeco’s private communications, documents and data in
possession of Colombia, its internal and external counsel, and its
witnesses and experts, indicating the chain of custody as well as the dates
of access.

 

- Issue an order declaring inadmissible all documents irregularly obtained or
produced by Colombia in breach of its duty of good faith and rules of privilege,
and striking out any statements in Colombia’s Counter-Memorial and/or witness
statements and expert reports that rely on such documents.

On 3 August 2017, Respondent submitted its response. Respondent explained that
the Disputed Documents had been legally obtained by SIC in the context of a
preliminary investigation into unfair practices by Prodeco and its affiliates and
requested that the Tribunal declare the Disputed Documents admissible.

By letter of 22 August 2017, Claimants submitted their reply to Respondent’s
response and slightly amended their request for relief [previously defined as
“Claimants’ First Application”).

Criminal Complaint

On Sunday, 10 September 2017, ANDJE filed a criminal complaint with the office
of the Fiscalia General de la Nacién, based on the Disputed Documents
[the “Criminal Complaint”).

The Criminal Complaint, which was registered by the Fiscalia the following day,
reported that certain named persons related to the execution of the Eighth
Amendment may have committed the following crimes:

- bribery,

- conclusion of a contract lacking legal requirements,

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

- conspiracy to commit a crime, and
- undue interest of a public servant in the conclusion of contracts.°
The Criminal Complaint included a request that the Fiscal depose (inter alia):

- Mr. Nagle, Prodeco’s CEO from 2008 to 2013, and Claimants’ witness in this
arbitration, and

- Ms. Anaya, one of Claimants’ in-house counsel.
B. The Decisions in PO No. 2

On 4 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, in which it made
the following decisions:

First, that the Disputed Documents should be excluded from the record of this
arbitration.’ Consequently, the Tribunal directed Respondent to re-submit its
Counter-Memorial without attaching or referring to the Disputed Documents.*®

Second, the Tribunal gave the Parties the opportunity to file new requests for
document production that would supersede and replace the original requests still
pending before the Tribunal.?

Third, as regards the filing of the Criminal Complaint by ANDJE, the Tribunal
refused to take any actions, but:

- Clarified that decisions adopted by Colombian criminal courts, which could
potentially have an impact on the present procedure, could be freely marshalled
by the Parties, subject to the rule established in para. 17(3) of Procedural Order
No. 1;!°

- On the issue of marshalling of criminal evidence, the Tribunal found that it had
not been sufficiently briefed but, as a precautionary measure, instructed the
Parties to ask permission from the Tribunal before submitting any evidence
gathered in a criminal procedure in Colombia;!! and

- Instructed Colombia to implement appropriate measures to guarantee that
Colombia’s counsel in this arbitration (including ANDJE’s officials) did not

have access to confidential attorney communications emanating from the
criminal investigations. !

Finally, the Tribunal proposed a new procedural calendar, which was agreed by the
Parties on 10 November 2017.

The Tribunal’s Rationale for Excluding the Disputed Documents

The Arbitral Tribunal decided the incident based on international law, and only
turned to municipal law to confirm its findings. !? This is consistent with the Parties’
arguments, '* the BIT and the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal found that the obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith and the
principle of equality of arms precluded Respondent from coercing evidence from
Claimants through its administrative powers, and to marshal it thereafter in an
investment arbitration.'° The Tribunal made reference to the general imbalance
between claimants, which are normally private companies, and respondent States
and explained that if States were allowed to use their wide powers to coerce
evidence from claimants, it would create a perverse incentive: States would initiate
all types of administrative proceedings against potential claimants in order to
improve their litigation positions. !”

Under Colombian law, the Tribunal confirmed that SIC was authorized to seize the
Disputed Documents for the sole purpose of an antitrust/unfair competition
investigation — but not for any other purpose, including the use of the Disputed
Documents as evidence in these proceedings. The Tribunal found that SIC had
failed to prove that the delivery of the Disputed Documents to ANDJE was done
for the sole purpose for which they had been obtained: to ensure compliance with
antitrust or unfair competition law:'* by handing over the Disputed Documents to
ANDIE, even if in compliance with the Cooperation Agreement, the SIC could have
incurred in an administrative irregularity known as desviacién de poder.'?

C. The Consequences of PO No. 2
PO No. 2 had two major consequences for the procedure.

The first consequence was that on 16 November 2017, Respondent filed its
Amended Counter-Memorial, eliminating all references to the Disputed
Documents. It also resubmitted all its evidence and eliminated the Disputed
Documents from the record.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

The second consequence of PO No. 2 was that the Parties were provided with a new
opportunity to obtain and submit evidence through a new document production
process. In particular, Respondent was allowed to request that Claimants deliver the
Disputed Documents in a context which preserved the equality of arms.

The Parties exercised this right extensively: Respondent made 39 requests for
production of documents and Claimants seven.

D. Parties’ Observations on PO No. 2

By letter of 14 November 2017, Respondent made observations on PO No. 2 and
submitted that the Tribunal was:

- Exceeding its powers;””
- Failing to state the reasons for its decisions;!

- Seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure, by infringing

Colombia’s due process rights.”?

Claimants answered Respondent’s letter in their Reply Memorial. Claimants
disagreed with Respondent’s allegations and submitted the following main
arguments:

- First, that in issuing PO No. 2 the Tribunal acted fully within its powers under

Arts. 44 and 46 of the ICSID Convention and 19 and 34(1) of the Rules to protect
the integrity of the proceedings;”*

- Second, that even if the Tribunal’s decision was flawed as a matter of Colombian

law (quod non), Respondent did not and could not argue that the Tribunal’s
reasoning based on the international principles of fairness and equality of arms
was erroneous;”4

- Finally, that the exclusion of documents obtained in violation of international

law by Colombia could not violate the rights of the party which had acted
unlawfully; and, in any case, PO No. 2 provided Respondent with the means to
obtain and present evidence in accordance with international law through the
document production exercise.”>

(2.2) PROCEDURAL ORDER No.3

In PO No. 3, the Arbitral Tribunal decided on the Parties’ contested document
production requests.

The Tribunal analysed each of the requests:7°

- The Tribunal first analysed whether each request complied with the ordinary

requirements of:

0. identification of each document or description of a narrow and specific
category of documents;

o. relevance and materiality; and

© not in possession of the requesting party;

- The Tribunal then reviewed whether each request was affected by one of the

following objections, if raised by the Parties:
o. legal or settlement privilege;
o. production results in unreasonable burden;
o loss or destruction;
o. technical or commercial confidentiality;
o. political or institutional sensitivity;
oO production would affect the fairness and equality of the procedure.

The Tribunal accepted (wholly or partially)?” 23 out of Respondent’s 39 requests
and four out of Claimants’ seven requests.

(2.3) PROCEDURAL ORDER No. 4

PO No. 4 was prompted by Respondent’s failure to obtain through document
production all of the Disputed Documents. The Tribunal will first explain the road
that led to the decision (A.), will briefly summarize it (B.), and finally explain its
consequences (C.).

A. The Road to PO No. 4
A few days after the issuance of PO No. 3, which ruled on the Parties’ document

production requests, Claimants requested that the Tribunal extend the deadline for
production of documents responsive to Colombia’s requests. The Tribunal granted

26 PO No. 2, paras. 110-138.

the extension, ordering that delivery be performed as the documents became
available and, in any case, no later than 5 February 2018.

On 5 February 2018, Claimants produced to Respondent:

- 366 documents, comprising more than 1GB of information in response to
Colombia’s document requests; and

- a letter accompanied by a privilege log [the “Privilege Log”), identifying
documents responsive to Respondent’s requests which were subject to legal or
settlement privilege [“Privilege Log Documents”], as well as

- redacted documents [“Redacted Documents”),

- [the Privilege Log Documents and the Redacted Documents will be jointly
referred to as the “Privileged Documents”).

On 23 February 2018, Respondent requested [“Respondent’s Privilege Log
Request’) that the Tribunal order Claimants to produce the Privileged Documents
in the following terms:

“To order Claimants to produce, within 48 hours, un-redacted copies of the
Redacted Documents;

To order Claimants to produce, within 48 hours, the Privilege Log Documents,
redacting only in those documents exchanged with external counsel the
relevant portions where legal advice was sought or given;

Should any of the Documents be available in a native format (such as .msg for
email communications), to order production in such format;

To complete their production of documents in accordance with Procedural
Order No. 3 and to confirm that they have completed production of all

documents responsive to Colombia’s requests; and

To order Claimants to reimburse Colombia for the costs and expenses incurred
because of this incident (as quantified when this incident is resolved).”

On 2 March 2018, Claimants answered Respondent’s Privilege Log Request:

- explaining that they had produced 366 documents, comprising more than 1GB
of information in response to Colombia’s document requests, and

- confirming that they had “produced and/or logged all documents responsive to
the Tribunal’s orders in Claimant’s possession, custody and control”.*

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Claimants requested that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent’s Privilege Log
Request.”?

On 6 March 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal provided guidance as to how to proceed:

“[...] The challenge to any Redacted Document or to any Privilege Log
Documents must be done on a document-by-document basis. Thus, the
Tribunal cannot entertain Colombia’s general Request for Relief either for all
the Redacted Documents or for all the Privilege Log Documents.

In order to solve this incident in the quickest and most efficient way possible,
the Tribunal suggests that the Parties confer and try to reach an agreement on
any disputed document. If, having made the appropriate good faith efforts to
find a solution, it cannot be reached, the Tribunal will gladly solve any
requests on a document-by-document basis. [...].”

On 9 March 2018, Respondent submitted a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal noting that
at least two of Colombia’s arguments in its communication of 2 March 2018 did
not require the Tribunal to rule on a “document-by-document basis”. In particular,
according to Colombia, a decision on a document-by-document basis was not
required in order to rule that:

- Claimants openly disregarded the Tribunal’s directions in PO No. 2, and

- Documents sent or received by in-house counsel are not privileged.

Colombia reserved all of its rights.*” It stated that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
it undertook to comply with the Tribunal’s directions and confer, in good faith, with
Claimants in regard to their Privilege Log. Nevertheless, on the basis that it was
likely that it would not obtain the Privileged Documents before the submission of
its Rejoinder, Colombia reserved its rights to submit the evidence as soon as it came
into its possession, custody or control.*!

Claimants presented a letter on 12 March 2018 inter alia denouncing:

- Respondent’s new attempt to reintroduce in the record the Disputed Documents

through Respondent’s Privilege Log Request;

- Respondent’s mischaracterization of the Tribunal’s email of 6 March 2018.

In its communication of 17 March 2018, the Tribunal thanked the Parties for their
efforts in trying to reach an agreement and clarified that it had not taken any
decision with regard to the admissibility of the Privileged Documents:

“The Arbitral Tribunal appreciates the Parties’ good faith efforts to reach an
agreement on the production of the Documents (as defined in Respondent’s
letter dated March 9, 2018). Should the Parties prove unable to reach an

agreement with regard to the production of some (or the totality) of such
Documents, the Tribunal repeats its willingness to adjudicate the issue on a
document-by-document basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal
reiterates that it has not taken any decision with regard to the admissibility of
such Documents.”

After approximately two weeks, on 27 March 2018, Respondent presented a new
letter to the Tribunal explaining the steps taken to comply with the Tribunal’s
guidance. Colombia requested that the Tribunal order Claimants to produce the
Privileged Documents without delay, and in any event, by 2 April 2018.*?

On 2 April 2018, Claimants responded, arguing that Colombia’s comments simply
reiterated the same two allegations already set forth in its letter of 23 February 2018,
namely that:

- Claimants’ assertions of privilege were belated, and

- Privilege does not attach to communications sent or received by Prodeco’s
in-house counsel.

B. The Decision in PO No. 4
On 24 April 2018, the Tribunal issued PO No. 4.
There were three main issues before the Tribunal:

- Whether Claimants had failed to follow the appropriate proceedings for filing
their Privilege Log;

- Whether the attorney-client privilege extended to in-house counsel; and

- Whether Claimants properly asserted settlement privilege over the Privileged
Documents.

To decide such issues, the Arbitral Tribunal applied international law and,

alternatively municipal law, as pleaded by the Parties.**

The Tribunal adopted the following decisions:

First, it decided that while Claimants had not strictly complied with the Tribunal’s
instructions in PO No. 2 concerning privilege-based objections, this departure from
the established procedure had not caused Respondent irreparable harm.*+ The
Tribunal found that Respondent had been given ample opportunity to contest
Claimants’ objections by submitting comments on Claimants’ Privilege Log, which

the Tribunal had analysed in order to reach its decision.*° As a consequence, the
Tribunal decided not to dismiss in limine Claimants’ objections based on
privilege.*®

Second, as to the merits of the objections, the Tribunal found that legal privilege
extended not only to communications with outside counsel, but also to
communications with in-house lawyers and found no evidence suggesting that
Claimants had waived legal or, to the extent relevant, settlement privilege.*”

Third, the Tribunal directed Claimants’ lead counsel (i) to submit an affidavit
confirming that each of the Privileged Documents met all of the privilege
requirements identified by the Tribunal and (ii) immediately to produce all the
relevant documents that did not.**

C. The Consequences of PO No. 4
On 30 April 2018, Claimants’ lead counsel submitted an affidavit declaring that:

- He had reviewed all of the documents over which Claimants had asserted
privilege, as identified in the Privilege Log;

- He confirmed that all of the documents over which Claimants had asserted
privilege fulfilled the requirements provided for in para. 54 of PO No. 4, except
for two;

- He attached the two documents that did not comply with the requirements.

Summing up, Claimants delivered to Respondent all documents identified in
Respondent’s requests, except for certain documents which met the requirements
for claiming privilege as set forth in para. 54 of PO No. 4. Compliance with these
requirements was proven by an affidavit signed, under his personal responsibility,
by Claimants’ lead counsel.

(2.4) PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 6

Respondent made further attempts to marshal certain Disputed Documents and
certain Seized Emails attached to the Criminal Complaint.

The Tribunal will first explain the road that led to PO No. 6 (A.), will briefly
summarize it (B.), and finally explain its consequences (C.).

A. The Road to PO No. 6

In PO No. 4, the Arbitral Tribunal established a cut-off date for introducing further
evidence or filing further submissions in this proceeding:

“98. After May 11, 2018 no new submissions and no additional evidence shall
be admitted into the file, except as provided in the following paragraph.

99. If in exceptional circumstances and for unexpected reasons any of the
Parties considers that it is of paramount importance that an exception to the
tule be made, it shall file a motion, asking for authorization, stating the
grounds therefor, and without attaching the new submission or evidence.
After hearing the other Party the Tribunal will decide. Any submission
made or evidence marshalled in breach of this provision will be
disregarded.”

On 11 May 2018, Claimants requested that a new document be introduced in the
record: NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Jerritt Canyon Mine prepared for
Queenstake Resources Ltd., dated 20 April 2007 [the “Report’”].

On the same day, Respondent presented a letter requesting that the following
documents be included in the file:

- Two sets of documents specified in Annex A of the letter: (i) Documents which
Colombia claimed to be responsive to its requests for production ordered in PO
No. 3 and (ii) Documents which Colombia alleged do not meet the cumulative
requirements set forth in PO No. 4 for legal privilege, and are not protected by
settlement privilege [the “Annex A Documents”]*’; both sets of documents (i)
and (ii) were part of the documents excluded by PO No. 2, i.e. the Disputed
Documents;

- Certain documents [the “FGN Documents”], specified in Annex C of the letter,
which had been gathered by the Fiscalia General de la Nacion (and filtered by
Mr. Camilo Enciso, Colombia’s designated special counsel, in accordance with
the Tribunal’s directions).

On 14 May 2018, Claimants submitted a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal requesting
that the Tribunal reject Respondent’s request, and in the alternative order Colombia
to provide Claimants with copies of the FGN Documents for Claimants properly to
comment on Respondent’s request.

On the same day, the Tribunal and the Parties held the pre-hearing conference call,
in which Respondent agreed to provide Claimants with the FGN Documents. The
Tribunal and the Parties further agreed that:

* The Parties referred to these documents as the Disputed Documents, however, both Parties agreed that
all of the documents comprised within such category had been excluded by the Tribunal in PO No. 2 (Letter
from Colombia to the Tribunal of May 11, 2018, p. 1; Letter from Claimants to the Tribunal of 14 May
2018, p. 1).

- Respondent would submit its comments on Claimants’ request by 15 May 2018;

- Claimants would submit their comments on Respondent’s request to include the
FGN Documents by 17 May 2018;

- Given the time sensitive nature of the Parties’ requests, the Tribunal would issue
a decision by Friday, 18 May, and communicate the full decision and reasoning
to the Parties afterwards.

Hence, on 15 May 2018, Respondent submitted a letter [“Respondent’s FGN
Request”]:

-  Reiterating its request of 11 May 2018; and
- Requesting that the Tribunal dismiss Claimants’ request.

On 17 May 2018, Claimants submitted a letter to the Tribunal requesting that the
Tribunal reject Respondent’s FGN Request.

B. The Decision in PO No. 6

The Tribunal deliberated and decided to reject the Parties’ applications to introduce
further documents into the file. This decision was communicated by letter dated 18
May 2018:

“The Arbitral Tribunal has decided not to admit into the record any of the
documents requested by the Parties for the following reasons:

1. Claimants’ petition to admit the technical report identified in its email of
May 11, 2018 is belated since Claimants were the last to file a main
submission.

2. Respondent’s petition to admit the FGN Documents: the FGN Documents
did not make it into the record through Document Production and are not part
of a formal acusacion in a Colombian criminal court proceeding. Thus, the
Tribunal sees no reason to admit them into the record.

3. Respondent’s petition to admit Annex A Documents: there are two types of
documents that Respondent wishes the Tribunal to admit into the record:

a. documents that Claimants’ counsel has confirmed are subject to
privilege and

b. documents which — according to Claimants’ counsel — are not responsive
to the Tribunal’s decisions in PO3.

It falls within the responsibility of Claimants’ counsel to determine which
documents are responsive to Respondent’s petitions (as narrowed down by the
Tribunal) and which are subject to privilege. The Tribunal has no reason to
second guess these decisions.

On 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued PO No. 6 containing its full decision and
reasoning.

C. The Consequences of PO No. 6

In PO No. 6, the Arbitral Tribunal directed the Parties to make allegations if they
wished the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences based on the counterparty’s
decisions regarding responsiveness and privilege of ordered documents.

In its Rejoinder,*? Respondent asked the Arbitral Tribunal to draw adverse
inferences from Claimants’ failure to produce responsive evidence. In particular,
Respondent requested that the Tribunal draw eight specific adverse inferences from
Claimants’ conduct. To the extent that such requests are relevant, the Tribunal will
address them in later sections of this Award.

In the course of the Hearing, Respondent made one further request to marshal
certain Disputed Documents into the record. That request led to the filing of Doc.
R-100. The procedural incident is analysed in detail in section V.1.(3.3).C infra.

Ill. CHRONOLOGY OF FACTS

The dispute between the Parties stems from the execution of the eighth amendment
to the Mining Contract [the “Eighth Amendment”] and the facts that surrounded
such execution.

The Tribunal will start by describing the execution of the Mining Contract and the
ensuing period, during which the parties made seven amendments to the Mining
Contract (1).

The Tribunal will then turn to the negotiations that surrounded the Eighth and most
relevant amendment to the Mining Contract ((2), (4) and (5)). The Tribunal will
also describe the facts concerning Prodeco’s acquisition of a mining concession,
which, according to Respondent’s version of the facts, served as a bribe for the
State’s execution of the Eighth Amendment (3).

Finally, the Tribunal will examine the events that occurred after the execution of
the Eighth Amendment, namely the parties’ performance of the Eighth Amendment
((6) and (11)) and the proceedings which form the basis of Claimants’ claims in this
arbitration:

- The investigation by the Contraloria General de la Reptiblica [“Contraloria’”|

into whether the Eighth Amendment was detrimental to the Colombian State,
which led to a decision holding Prodeco liable for damages to the State’s
finances [the “Fiscal Liability Proceeding”] (7); and

- The claim filed by the mining agency responsible for the Mining Contract before

the Colombian administrative courts seeking to have the Eighth Amendment
declared null and void [the “Procedure for Contractual Annulment”] (8).

After the failure of amicable consultations, Claimants started the present arbitration
against Colombia (9). The Tribunal will also briefly address the criminal complaint
filed by Colombia after the start of this arbitration (10).

largest export, coal is a major source of revenues and employment for the country.*!

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

In accordance with Art. 3 of the 1988 Mining Code, the Respondent, through
Carbocol, chose to explore and exploit the resources in the Calenturitas area by
means of a contract with a private entity. Prodeco, a Colombian mining company
incorporated in 1974, was chosen for that purpose.

To this effect, on 21 February 1989, Prodeco and Carbocol executed a contract for
the exploration, construction, and exploitation of a coal project in the Calenturitas
Mine [defined as the “Mining Contract”].*°

The Mining Contract was initially entered into for a period of 30 years*! comprising
three stages: exploration, construction, and exploitation of the Calenturitas Mine.

In the exploration phase, Prodeco had to produce geological and engineering
studies, at its own cost and risk, to evaluate the potential of the Calenturitas Mine,
and submit a feasibility study for a coal-mining project.*? Once Carbocol approved
this feasibility study, Prodeco could start construction>? and, subsequently,
operation of the Mine.*+

From the beginning of the production phase and until the expiration of the Mining
Contract, Prodeco had the right to carry out activities of extraction, processing,
transport, and commercialization of the coal from the Mine.*> Prodeco could
produce up to three million tonnes [“MT”] of coal per year [“MTA”], which would
become its exclusive property. Prodeco could dispose of such coal as it deemed fit,
subject to the Colombian laws and regulations on the commercialization and
transformation of minerals.*°

As consideration for the granting of production and commercialization rights,
Prodeco had to pay a defined compensation to Carbocol. The terms agreed in 1989
were as follows:

- A5% base royalty for each tonne of coal sold, which progressively increased up
to 7.6% for the fifth year of production and beyond” [“Base Royalty”);

- A supplementary compensation** amounting to a percentage of revenue and a
fixed amount per tonne of coal sold, if the price of coal rose above USD 40 per

USD 25 per tonne; if this price rose above USD 40 per tonne, Prodeco would
receive extraordinary profits, and would have to pay the supplementary
compensation.°!

150. Other considerations included Prodeco’s obligation to contribute to the
social-economic development of the region of the Calenturitas Mine and to grant
Carbocol access to Prodeco’s port facilities [“Prodeco’s Port”]® for the export of
coal.

151. Between 1991 and 2007, the parties to the Mining Contract executed seven
“Otrosies”, or amendments, to the Mining Contract, which altered the initial basis
of this agreement.

B. 1991-2002: First, Second, Third and Fourth Amendment
First Amendment

152. In July 1989, Prodeco began to explore the Mine and to work on the preparation of
a feasibility study.©

153. Two years later, in 1991, Prodeco and Carbocol executed the First Amendment to
the Mining Contract, which increased the size of the area of the Calenturitas Mine
and defined the rules for trial production.

154. In 1992, Carbocol approved the feasibility study prepared by Prodeco. That same
year Prodeco started construction at the Mine.”

Second Amendment

155. In 1993, Carbocol became the Empresa Colombiana de Carbon Ltda. — Ecocarbén
[“Ecocarb6n”]. On 6 December 1995, Ecocarbén and Prodeco executed the Second

obtained the Port concession in 1979, for a term lasting until 2013 (Doc. CLEX-15, pp. 10-11 of the Estados
Financieros for 2012). In 2010 Prodeco began building a new port, which it now operates, known as Puerto
Nuevo. Puerto Nuevo’s concession belongs to the Sociedad Portuaria Puerto Nuevo S.A., in which Prodeco
has a 94.9% share (Doc. CLEX-15, pp. 10-11 of the Estados Financieros for 2014, Doc. CLEX-11, p. 17).

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Amendment to the Mining Contract,®* which established new rules regarding
Prodeco’s right to hire subcontractors.

The exploitation phase of the Mine officially started in October 1995, but in reality,
the mining activities were halted for several years,” in part because of a lack of
sufficient infrastructure to transport coal from the Mine to Prodeco’s Port, in part
because of low coal prices in the international market.”!

Third Amendment

In 1995, Prodeco was acquired by Glencore,”? a multinational commodity trading
and mining company.”

Three years later Prodeco submitted to Ecocarbon a revised feasibility study, which
envisioned a production of 5 MTA, and a new timeline for the project. Ecocarb6n
found that the revised feasibility study did not comply with the terms of the Mining
Contract, and gave Prodeco two alternatives: either to comply with the Contract and
the already approved feasibility study, or to negotiate a further amendment.’*

Accordingly, in 1999, the parties started negotiations,”> which led to the third
amendment to the Mining Contract [Third Amendment”]”° being executed two
years later, on 6 March 2001. The Third Amendment was signed by the new
Empresa Nacional Minera Ltda., Minercol Ltda. [Minercol”], which in the
meantime had succeeded Ecocarbén.””

Importantly, the Third Amendment:

- Created new obligations for Prodeco regarding the production phase (i), and

- Modified the existing compensation regime (ii).

(i) Within a term of six months, Prodeco was required to submit to Minercol’s
approval a final report on exploration (Informe Final de Exploracién [“IFE”]).”®
Following Minercol’s approval of the IFE, Prodeco had to prepare and deliver a
long-term work and investment plan (Programa de Trabajos e Inversiones
[PTI”]), concerning exploitation of the Mine.” In addition, Prodeco agreed to
submit a PTI for each year of the production phase [“Annual PTI”). Each Annual

PTI had to follow the exploitation sequence defined in the main PTI and contain a
production forecast for the next 10 years.*°

(ii) The Third Amendment envisaged a production of between “5 or 6 MTA” of
coal per year.*! This expansion led to changes in the compensation regime.

The Base Royalty continued to apply, as defined in the original Mining Contract,
as long as production did not exceed 3 MTA. Once production exceeded that
threshold, a newly defined “Additional Royalty” became applicable: the royalty
rate would increase by 1% for every 1 MTA increase in production. In effect, this
implied that after the fifth year of production — which was when the Base Royalty
attained 7.6% — if annual production was, for instance, 4, 5, or 6 MTA, Prodeco
would pay Royalties at a rate of 8.6%, 9.6%, and 10.6% on the entire price of the
coal sold.** For each 1 MTA of additional coal production, the rate of Royalties
would increase by 1%.*°

The Third Amendment also created a Compensacion por Ingresos Brutos (Gross
Income Compensation [“GIC”]), derived from the Supplementary Compensation
initially provided for in Clause 22.1 of the Mining Contract. The GIC was an
additional compensation, based on a sliding scale according to coal prices, which
became applicable if the coal price exceeded USD 40 per tonne.**

Thus, after the execution of the Third Amendment, Prodeco had to pay three types
of compensation depending upon the amount of production of the Mine and the
price of coal:

- A Base Royalty of 7.6%, which applied irrespectively of the amount of coal
produced;

- An Additional Royalty, when coal production exceeded 3 MTA, calculated
applying an increasing percentage scale;

- AGIC, which applied when the price of coal exceeded USD 40 per tonne.

The Third Amendment also defined the reference price which should be used to
calculate the amount of Royalties and GIC, as the higher of:*°

- The weighted average free on board [“FOB”] Colombian port price for the
current quarter for coal exported from the Calenturitas Mine, as published in the
“Coal Week International” magazine; and

Fourth Amendment

167. Later that same year (2001), Prodeco and Minercol executed the Fourth
Amendment to the Mining Contract,*° which clarified certain aspects of the Third
Amendment, namely:*7

- The duration of each of the stages of the Mining Contract;

- The terms for Prodeco’s social-economic investments in the Calenturitas region;
and

- The start date for the 30-year duration of the Mining Contract, which was set at
3 July 1990.

C. 2002-2004: The 2003 PTI and start of production

168. On 16 December 2002, Minercol approved Prodeco’s IFE.** One year later,*?
Prodeco submitted to Minercol a long-term PTI, in which it laid out its plan to
produce up to 4 MTA, for a total life-of-mine production of approximately 55 MT
of coal [2003 PTI”). According to Prodeco, maximum production was capped by
transport restrictions: coal had to be trucked to the Port and Prodeco stated that this
was the maximum quantity which could be transported given the poor condition of
roads and the limited availability of trucks.°”

169. In January 2004, the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy designated the
Instituto Colombiano de Geologia y Mineria, INGEOMINAS [“Ingeominas”], an
institute created in 1916 for geoscientific research,°! as Minercol’s successor, and
delegated the functions of mining authority to this agency.°”

171. In July 2004, the Calenturitas Mine finally entered into production.™ By the end of
that year the Mine had produced 0.6 MT of coal; production increased to 1.5 MTA
in the following year, 2005.°°

D. 2004: Fifth Amendment

The Contracting Committee

172. In June 2004, Ingeominas created by internal resolution a Comité de Contratacién
Minera [“Contracting Committee”), comprising Ingeominas’ Secretario General,
the Director del Servicio Minero, the Subdirectores de Contratacién y Titulacién
Minera and Fiscalizacién y Ordenamiento Minero, and an Asesor de la Direccién
General.

173. This Committee was responsible for advising the Director del Servicio Minero inter
alia on contracts of gran mineria for areas historically granted to Ecocarbén. In
particular, the Contracting Committee had the following function:°°

“Recomendar al Director del Servicio Minero la aprobacion o desaprobacion
de las solicitudes 1 das por los cesi ios relacionadas con
modificacion, prérroga, cesién, subcontratacién, suspensién y renuncia de
los contratos”.

174. The Contracting Committee thus became responsible for evaluating and making
any recommendation to the Director del Servicio Minero regarding Prodeco’s
requests to modify the Mining Contract.

175. In September 2004, the scope of the Contracting Committee’s functions was
slightly altered by another resolution of Ingeominas:”

“Recomendar a la Direccién del Servicio Minero o a las Subdirecciones de
Contratacion y Titulaci6n Minera y Fiscalizacién y Ordenamiento Minero la
aprobacion o rechazo de las peticiones presentadas por los beneficiarios de
los titulos mineros, relacionadas entre otros, con la modificacién, prérroga,
suspension, integracién de operaciones mineras y renuncia de los contratos
de concesién y demas titulos mineros”.

Fifth Amendment

Contract,” which clarified the calculation of the Base and Additional Royalties
(“Fifth Amendment”).

E. 2005: Sixth Amendment

It will be recalled that, in 1995, through the acquisition of Prodeco, !°° Glencore
became the indirect owner of concession rights over the Calenturitas Mine and
Prodeco’s Port.!°!

Acquisition of Carbones de la Jagua S.A.

In 2005, Glencore acquired Carbones de la Jagua S.A. [“CDJ”], a company that
held rights over some mining properties within the La Jagua coal mining project,
located approximately 20 kilometres east of the Calenturitas Mine. Glencore was
later able to consolidate ownership of the La Jagua coal project by acquiring
Consorcio Minero Unido S.A. [““CMU”] in 2006 and Carbones El Tesoro [““CET”’]
in 2007.!? The Tribunal shall refer to CDJ, CMU, and CET jointly as the “Prodeco
Affiliates”.

Sixth Amendment

One of the advantages of this acquisition was the blending of coal from the
Calenturitas and La Jagua Mines-'® a procedure which called for an amendment of
the Mining Contract.!* Accordingly, on 15 December 2005, Prodeco and
Ingeominas executed the sixth amendment to the Mining Contract [“Sixth
Amendment”]. This Amendment clarified how the Royalties and GIC payments
should be calculated when the coal volume exported consisted of coal from the
Calenturitas Mine blended with coal from other mines [“Blended Coal”].!°°

The Sixth Amendment also changed the reference price for calculating Royalties
and GIC, from the “Coal Week International” price to the price of Colombian
thermal coal published by the Platts “International Coal Report” [“ICR”], adjusted
for calorific value. The Amendment specified that: !°°

- If the coal exported by Prodeco came exclusively from the Mine, the reference

price would be the higher of (i) the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian
steam coal for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific
value, and (ii) the shipment price estimated by Prodeco;

- If the coal exported by Prodeco was Blended Coal, the reference price would

simply be the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal, for the
respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value.

Railway

In March 2006, Prodeco, CDJ and CMU, the two mining companies recently
acquired by Glencore, entered into an association contract with other coal
producers, with the aim of sharing the use of a railway under concession to
Ferrocarriles del Norte de Colombia S.A. [“Fenoco”]. Prodeco eventually
indirectly acquired a 39.76% ownership interest in Fenoco.!°”

This railway linked the Mine region with ports situated in the Atlantic coast,
specifically with Prodeco’s Port, and solved Prodeco’s transport difficulties: rail
transport permitted the shipping of higher quantities of coal, at lower costs, and an
increase in the capacity of the Calenturitas Mine.

F. 2006: The 2006 PTI

Production at the Calenturitas Mine continued to grow in 2006. In that year the
Mine produced 2.9 MTA, almost twice the 2005 production. !°°

In addition, in 2006, Prodeco realized that it was possible to divert a section of the
Calenturitas River that ran through the Mine, thereby increasing the amount of
exploitable resources. !?

Consequently, in November 2006, Prodeco submitted a revised long-term PTI to
Ingeominas, with new coal production objectives [2006 PTI’”]. Prodeco proposed
to expand total coal production from the Mine to 116 MT between 2007 to 2019
(more than doubling the 55 MT envisioned in the 2003 PTD), initially at a rate of
4.4 MTA starting in 2007, and gradually increasing to 10 MTA from 2010
onwards:!!°

The 2006 PTI also foresaw an investment of USD 500.1 million [“M’] being made
in the years 2007-2010 (broken down as USD 196.4 M for equipment, USD 114.6
M for railway, USD 85.2 M for infrastructure, and USD 103.9 M for port and sundry
investments), and an additional investment of USD 684.4 M for the remaining life
of the project.!!!

The net present value of the project was estimated at USD 98 M (applying a
discount rate of 15%), assuming costs of USD 24.79 per tonne of coal!!? and a coal
sales price of USD 42.58 per tonne. !'>

Mine-life Royalties to be paid to Ingeominas were estimated at USD 671 M.!!*+

The 2006 PTI also provided for additional exploratory drilling in Sectors B and D
of the Mine. !!5

On 7 February 2007, Ingeominas approved the 2006 PTI, finding that this plan was
more favourable than the original PTI, taking into account that it would generate a
significantly higher compensation for the State. Ingeominas demanded, however,
that in 2009 Prodeco submit an updated PTI, incorporating the results of the
additional exploratory drilling in Sectors B and D.''¢

G. 2007: Seventh Amendment

While Prodeco awaited the approval of the 2006 PTI, it consulted Ingeominas
regarding the potential execution of a seventh amendment to the Mining Contract,
with the goal of increasing the duration of the Contract and changing the existing
Royalties regime, in particular for sales of coal in the Colombian domestic market.
Prodeco explained that in order to be able to extract the maximum amount of coal
resources and to profit from the significant investments it would make in the
Calenturitas project — estimated at USD 1,184 M — the exploitation phase would
need to be extended for a period of 20 years.!!7

After lengthy negotiations and upon the Contracting Committee’s recommendation,
on 15 February 2007, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the Seventh Amendment
to the Mining Contract [“Seventh Amendment”].!!

The main thrust of the Seventh Amendment was to extend the duration of the
Mining Contract by 15 years, until 3 July 2035.!!° The justification given was that
the 2006 PTI provided for the mining of an additional 60 MT of coal, and an

increase of the capacity of the Mine to 10 MTA. The Considerando 6 of the Seventh
Amendment concludes: !”°

“En consecuencia los recursos que generard el proyecto por
contraprestaciones econédmicas a favor del Estado se incrementan
sustancialmente frente a lo previsto en el PTI original [...]”.

The Seventh Amendment also allowed Prodeco to allocate up to 15% of its annual
coal production to local sales; in such a case, Royalties would be calculated
pursuant to the base price defined by the Unidad de Planeacién Minero
Energética. '?!

The basic system for quantifying Royalties and GIC was not changed, but a few
clarifications and amendments were added. The Seventh Amendment provided:

- That if the coal exported by Prodeco came exclusively from the Mine, the

reference price for payment of Royalties and GIC would be the higher of (i) the
FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal for the respective week as
published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value [“FOB Price”], and (ii) the
actual sale price; 122

- That Royalties and GIC would be calculated and paid within ten days of the

shipment of coal, but would be subject to a quarterly readjustment “based on the
definitive prices”!?? (as will be explained later, the interpretation of this
provision would become the subject of a debate between the Parties).

Finally, the Seventh Amendment required Prodeco to submit a revised long-term
PTI in January 2009, detailing its plans to exploit the Mine until 2035 and
incorporating the results of the additional exploration conducted in Sectors B and
p.'4

THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT: PRELIMINARY STEPS

Claimants argue that by signing the Eighth Amendment:

- Ingeominas agreed to amend the Mining Contract and to change the system for

calculating the Royalties and the GIC, and

- In exchange, Prodeco undertook a massive additional program of investment,

increasing the productive capacity of the Mine.

The result was a ‘win-win’ situation: Ingeominas would earn a higher remuneration
(albeit by applying lower Royalties and GIC to a much higher production) and

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Prodeco would be able to make the necessary investments and develop the Mine to
its full capacity.

199. Respondent contests Claimants’ version of the facts and argues that Claimants
concealed and misrepresented crucial information in order to mislead the State into
accepting an unjustifiable renegotiation of the Mining Contract, to the sole benefit
of Claimants and to the detriment of the State. According to Respondent, Claimants
made wilful misrepresentations, colluded with public servants, and engaged in
corrupt practices, all in order to execute the Eighth Amendment. !75

200. The Tribunal will carefully analyse the evidence and establish the proven facts,
starting with the preliminary steps which eventually led to the execution of the
Eighth Amendment.

A. May 2008: Prodeco’s First Approach

201. In February 2007, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the Seventh Amendment, and
in October 2007 Prodeco delivered an Annual PTI for the year 2008. This PTI
detailed the operations planned for 2008 and envisioned a production of 5 MTA.!?¢

202. The Seventh Agreement did not change the basic structure of the remuneration
which Prodeco had to pay to Ingeominas:

- On the one side, progressive Royalties were calculated on the basis of an
increasing scale, which added a 1% for every additional MTA produced by the
Mine above; if the estimated production of 10 MTA was reached, the applicable
Royalties rate would amount to 14.6%, to be applied to the totality of the coal
sold; should production reach 11 MTA, the rate would rise to 15.6%, again to
be applied to the totality of production;

- On the other side, the GIC reference price of USD 40 per tonne had not been
changed since 1989; and as a result of inflationary increases in Prodeco’s mining
costs, Prodeco had to pay Colombia a share of its gross revenues at price levels
that barely covered its production costs.

203. Six months after executing the Seventh Amendment, Prodeco decided to approach
Ingeominas regarding a potential new amendment to the Mining Contract. !’

204. On 23 May 2008, Prodeco’s representatives met with Ingeominas’ Director
General, Mr. Mario Ballesteros [Mr. Ballesteros”], and made a presentation,
based on an extensive PowerPoint, suggesting a revision of the economic conditions
of the Mining Contract.!?8 A few days thereafter, on 28 May, Prodeco submitted a
9-page formal request.'° Prodeco argued that the existing compensation

arrangement compromised the potential expansion and even the viability of the
Calenturitas mining project. '*°

Accordingly, Prodeco proposed that, in order to guarantee the sustainability of
Colombia’s returns and the viability of the mining project, certain conditions agreed
upon in the Mining Contract should be amended: '*!

- Replacing the ICR index by the API2-BCI7 indexes; !*

- Calculating Royalties and GIC based on the value of coal at the pithead of the
Mine;

- Capping Royalties at 10%;
- Updating the value of the GIC and introducing a formula for indexation.

Prodeco proposed the creation of a committee to analyse these potential
modifications and, in the meantime, the execution of a memorandum of
understanding. °°

Ingeominas’ reaction

A few days  thereafter,!** Ingeominas’ Subdirector de Fiscalizacién  y
Ordenamiento Minero, Mr. Edward Franco, prepared an extensive legal and
economic report, analysing Prodeco’s proposal. The report was delivered to
Mr. Ballesteros, for submission to Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo.'*° Mr. Franco’s
proposal to the Consejo Directivo was the following: !*°

“En cuanto a la modificaci6n propuesta se recomienda no acceder a la misma
por ser poco favorable para los intereses de la Nacién”.

Despite this initial analysis, Prodeco and Ingeominas held further meetings to
discuss the changes proposed by Prodeco.!*7

B. July 2008: Prodeco’s second approach

On 15 July 2008, Prodeco sent to Ingeominas a second formal request for the
revision of the economic conditions of the Mining Contract and the reduction of
Royalties and GIC. That extensive request further developed Prodeco’s original

proposal and added a new supporting argument: if Ingeominas were prepared to
reduce the compensation, Prodeco would increase its investments and increase the
capacity of the Mine.!°*

Prodeco submitted a precise calculation of two scenarios — one, if the Mining
Contract was not amended, and the other, if Prodeco’s proposals were accepted.'*?

In essence, Prodeco was proposing to Ingeominas what Prodeco considered to be a
‘win-win’ deal: if Ingeominas agreed to a reduction of its Royalties, Prodeco would
commit to making additional investments, production of the Mine would increase,
costs would be cut, sales would be higher, and at the end of the life of the Mine,
Prodeco would have earned higher profits and Colombia would have received
significantly higher Royalties and taxes.

C. July 2008 — April 2009: The Dispute over the Definitive Price

In its letter dated 15 July 2008, Prodeco also raised for the first time an interpretative
issue regarding the definition of the so-called “Definitive Price” provision in the
Seventh Amendment to the Mining Contract. '*°

Pro memoria, the Seventh Amendment had established that the reference price for
payment of Royalties and GIC would be the higher of (i) the FOB Price!*! and
(ii) the actual sale price. Royalties and GIC would initially be calculated and paid
within ten days of the shipment of coal, but they would be subject to a quarterly
readjustment — upward or downward — “based on the definitive prices.”!4*

In the letter Prodeco asserted that there were two possible interpretations of the term
“Definitive Price:”!4

- The first interpretation would equal Definitive Price with the actual sale price

received by Prodeco, evidenced in the invoices issued to the buyers;

- Under an alternative interpretation, Definitive Price would be the higher of

(i) the FOB Price in the week when the coal was shipped and (ii) the actual sale
price obtained by Prodeco.

Prodeco acknowledged that hitherto it had calculated the Definitive Price on the
basis of the second alternative; but Prodeco now submitted that this interpretation
failed to take into account that the market situation had drastically changed.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Prodeco proposed to Ingeominas that the Mining Contract be modified, so that
Royalties and GIC be calculated on the basis of Prodeco’s actual sale price. '##

In late August and early September 2008, Prodeco held meetings with the Ministro
de Minas y Energia, Mr. Hernan Martinez Torres, and with Mr. Ballesteros to
discuss the revision of the Mining Contract. '4> The evidence shows that the Minister
agreed that it would be fair and reasonable for the Royalties to be calculated using
the actual price received by Prodeco. '4°

No negative inference

Respondent says that given Claimants’ failure to produce documents responsive to
Colombia’s request, the Tribunal must conclude that Prodeco actively sought to
fabricate a dispute over payment of royalties to force Ingeominas into negotiating
what would become the Eighth Amendment. '*7

The Tribunal disagrees.

There is no evidence that Prodeco “fabricated” a dispute, i.e. that it pursued a
request knowing that it was not entitled to the rights claimed. To the contrary: the
Minister of Mines agreed with the reasonableness of Prodeco’s position, which
proves that Prodeco at least had a prima facie case.

Prodeco unilaterally construes the Mining Contract

On 8 September 2008, Prodeco sent a letter to Ingeominas, stating that as of
30 September 2008 it would start readjusting the amount of Royalties and GIC
based on a Definitive Price equal to that paid by the end consumer.'48

One month later, Prodeco did as it had anticipated: it paid the adjustment amount
corresponding to the Royalties and GIC of the third quarter of 2008, applying the
new interpretation of Definitive Prices. This led to an underpayment of USD 6 M
in favour of Prodeco.

This interpretation, and consequent adjustment, was not accepted by Ingeominas.
On 17 October 2008, Ingeominas replied to Prodeco saying that it was still
evaluating the viability of the proposed contractual modification. According to
Ingeominas, the reference price for the calculation of Royalties and GIC was the
one published by the ICR, and any unilateral modification was without effect.

Hence, Ingeominas demanded that Prodeco comply with the terms of the Mining
Contract. !°

Prodeco responded ten days later, stating that it was aware that any modification of
the Mining Contract had to be bilaterally agreed, but that it was not seeking an
amendment of the Definitive Price clause, given that its meaning was clear.'*°

Ingeominas’ Reguerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad

On 23 January 2009, Ingeominas formally demanded payment of the amount in
dispute through a Requerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad. Ingeominas asserted
that Prodeco’s unilateral interpretation of the Mining Contract amounted to a
contractual breach. Through the Requerimiento, Ingeominas threatened Prodeco
with a declaration of caducidad of the Contract if payment was not effected or an
appropriate justification provided within one month.'>!

Prodeco replied to the Requerimiento on 13 February 2009, restating the reasons
for its interpretation of the Definitive Price term used in the Contract, and pointing
out that Ingeominas had not explained why it disagreed with such interpretation. !*?

In April 2009, Prodeco approached Ingeominas regarding the outstanding royalty
payments and proposed paying all the disputed amounts into an escrow account,
until the dispute on the proper interpretation of the term Definitive Price had been
settled.'*? Ingeominas ultimately rejected this proposal, insisting that Prodeco pay
the disputed amounts directly to Ingeominas in cash, before negotiations could

progress. 4

D. November 2008: Annual PTI for 2009

In November 2008, Prodeco delivered to Ingeominas the Annual PTI for the year
2009, which envisaged a production of almost 7.2 MTA, and the start of the works
for diverting the Calenturitas River, which would lead to an increase in the total
Mine production of 80 MT of coal. !*>

Pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, in January 2009, Prodeco was due to submit
its revised long-term PTI, detailing its plans to exploit the Mine until 2035 and
accounting for the results of the additional exploration in Sectors B and D.'*°
Nevertheless, since Prodeco had not completed its exploration program, it requested

that the time to submit the PTI be extended until 30 May 2009,'°7 a request which
Ingeominas granted. !>* In fact, because of the parties’ parallel negotiations, Prodeco
would not submit such PTI until June 2010.'%?

E. March 2009: Sale of Prodeco to Xstrata

In March 2009, Glencore sold Prodeco to the Australian mining company Xstrata,
for a net consideration of USD 2 Bn; Glencore, however, retained a call option to
repurchase Prodeco — which it eventually exercised.'

THE 3HA CONTRACT

Before continuing with its description of the negotiation and execution of the Eighth
Amendment, the Tribunal must address a highly relevant averment of Colombia:
namely, that Claimants obtained the Eighth Amendment through corruption. This
is the factual predicate of Colombia’s argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
to decide this case.

Respondent alleges that Claimants bribed Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas’ Director
General, in order to secure his support for the execution of the Eighth Amendment,
and that it paid the bribe through a complex scheme: Prodeco bought for a price of
USD 1.75 M a concession contract [the “3ha Contract”] for the exploration and
production of coal in a parcel of three hectares located in the middle of the La Jagua
mine from a former employee of the Ministry of Mines and his partner.!°!
Respondent says that these individuals were strawmen of Mr. Ballesteros, who
ultimately benefitted from the consideration paid by Prodeco, and the payment was
the quid pro quo for the execution of the Eighth Amendment.

The Tribunal will establish the proven facts, and in order to do so it will recount the
full story of the 3ha Contract, starting in 2006.

A. November 2006: A Coveted Concession Contract

On 29 November 2006, Mr. Jorge Maldonado [“Mr. Maldonado”] — a former
employee of the Ministry of Mines and of Ingeominas’ predecessors — and his
partner, Mr. César Garcia, filed a request with Ingeominas to obtain a concession
contract for the exploration and production of coal in a parcel of 3 hectares. !°

These 3 hectares were located in the middle of several concessions which formed
part of the La Jagua project and were exploited by Glencore through the Prodeco

Affiliates (at the time only CDJ and CMU, since CET would be acquired in
2007).1°

Four months after Mr. Maldonado’s application, Ingeominas issued on 2 March
2007 a technical report concluding that the 3ha Contract would partially overlap
with other nearby concessions and that it was too small for a stand-alone mining
operation.'* A week thereafter, on 17 March 2007, Ingeominas formally rejected
Mr. Maldonado’s application for the 3ha Contract. !°

In January 2008, after Glencore’s acquisition of CET, the Prodeco Affiliates
submitted an agreement for the integrated use of mining infrastructure (Acuerdo de
Uso Integrado de Infraestructura Minera) to Ingeominas, in order to conduct joint
operations in the mining areas of the La Jagua project [“Integrated Use
Agreement”].'® Ingeominas approved this Agreement on 28 January 2008.!°7

On 10 March 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates submitted to Ingeominas a formal
opposition to the 3ha Contract, requesting that Ingeominas: '®

- Correct the errors in the coordinates of the titles granted to the Prodeco

Affiliates, which had created the three-hectare gap; or

- Alternatively, reject the request for the 3ha Contract, because it would be

technically impractical to exploit such a small area.

Ingeominas backtracks and awards the 3ha Contract

In June 2008, Ingeominas backtracked on its original decision, finding that the 3ha
Contract area did not overlap with other mining concessions, and rejecting the
objections of the Prodeco Affiliates.'® In July 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates filed a
request for reconsideration, !”° which Ingeominas rejected on 19 August 2008.!7!

B. August 2008 - November 2008: Prodeco Complains to Authorities

Prodeco was now faced with the situation that Ingeominas was about to grant the
3ha Contract to Mr. Maldonado and his partner — a concession which threatened to
disrupt the development of the La Jagua mine. In this situation, Prodeco decided to
complain in writing to various Colombian authorities — including the Ministro de
Presidencia.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

First, on 26 August 2008, Ms. Margarita Zuleta, a lawyer acting on behalf of the
Prodeco Affiliates, filed a formal complaint regarding the anomalies surrounding
the 3ha Contract with Colombia’s Procurador General de la Nacién.'”? Ms. Zuleta
also forwarded this complaint to the Ministro de Minas y Energia, to the Ministro
de la Presidencia, to Mr. Ballesteros (Ingeominas’ General Director), and to the
Contraloria,‘” the Republic’s supervisory agency.

 

Second, on 22 September 2008, Ms. Zuleta approached the Procurador General
again, saying that Ingeominas’ rejection of the Prodeco Affiliates’ request for
reconsideration constituted a violation of due process and of the applicable mining
provisions. Ms. Zuleta emphasised that the Procurador General should investigate
the fact that the 3ha Contract had been awarded to an ex-employee of the agency,
since there had been clear irregularities and an undue use of insider information.'7*
This letter was, once again, forwarded to the Ministro de Minas y Energia, to the
Ministro de la Presidencia, and to the Contraloria.'

Third, on 6 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates sent a complaint to Mr. Ballesteros
and Mr. Edward Franco (with a copy to the Procurador General, the Ministro de
Minas y Energia, the Ministro de la Presidencia and the Contraloria), asking
Ingeominas to review the 3ha Contract and to refrain from granting, or at least from
registering, the 3ha Contract.!7°

Fourth, on 10 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates asked the Jefe del Registro
Minero Nacional (with a copy to the Procurador General, the Contraloria, the
Ministro de Minas y Energia and the Ministro de la Presidencia) to refrain from
registering the 3ha Contract, claiming that he had a duty to the defend the national
interest.!””

 

Execution of the 3ha Contract

Notwithstanding the Prodeco Affiliates’ appeals and complaints, on 16 October
2008, Ingeominas (represented by Mr. Franco Gamboa) and Mr. Maldonado and
his partner executed the 3ha Contract, and the latter thus became owners of the 3ha
mining concession. '7*

Prodeco quickly reacted: on 21 November 2008, Ms. Zuleta asked Ingeominas’
Coordinador del Grupo de Control Interno Disciplinario to open a disciplinary
investigation against the employees involved in awarding the 3ha Contract (with a
copy to the Procurador General, the Ministro de Minas y Energia, the Ministro de

counsel filed a citizen’s suit (accién popular) against Ingeominas and Messrs.
Maldonado and Garcia based on the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract. !*°

C. May 2009: CDJ Buys the 3ha Contract

247. In the meantime, in December 2008, Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia approached
Prodeco through an intermediary, offering to sell the 3ha Contract for USD 11 M.!*!

 

248. At the end of March 2009,'*? the Prodeco Affiliates made a last complaint to the
Ministro de Presidencia about the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract.
Prodeco warned that the lack of a solution to the 3ha Contract situation would leave
Prodeco with no option other than to engage in direct negotiations with
Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia. '83

249. Once again faced with the silence and inaction of the Colombian authorities,
Prodeco decided to pursue the option of buying the 3ha Contract from Messrs.
Maldonado and Garcia.

250. The transaction took place on 4 May 2009:'* Ms. Elsa Aragén Barrera, acting on
behalf and in representation of Mr. Maldonado, and Mr. Garcia signed an agreement
assigning the 3ha Contract to CDJ, one of the Prodeco Affiliates, which paid
USD 1.75 M as consideration [the “Assignment Contract”].'*

Approval by Ingeominas

251. Prodeco and Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia submitted the Assignment Contract to
Ingeominas for approval.'*° In that version of the Contract, the price paid was
unspecified: !8”

The transaction was also reflected in CDJ’s audited financial statements of February
2010.'°? On 1 February 2010, CDJ informed Ingeominas that it had acquired the
3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia, this time disclosing the
consideration of USD 1.75 M:!%3

 

D. May 2011: Further Developments

There is evidence that even after the Assignment Contract had been executed,
Prodeco continued to complain about the irregular character of the grant of the
three-hectare concession to Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia.

Mr. Paredes, Respondent’s witness in this arbitration, who replaced Mr. Ballesteros
as Director General of Ingeominas, recalls that Dra. Zuleta personally raised the
issue with him. !°*

In a press conference of May 2011, the newly, appointed Ministro de Minas y
Energia, Mr. Carlos Rodado, acknowledged the irregularities behind the 3ha
Contract.'®° In June 2011, Mr. Rodado asked the Procuraduria General de la
Nacion, the Contraloria, and the Fiscalia General de la Nacién to start formal
investigations into irregularities within Ingeominas.!°°

THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT: NEGOTIATIONS

Pro memoria: while the facts concerning the 3ha Contract were developing,
Prodeco was involved in a dispute with Ingeominas, regarding the proper
interpretation of the term “Definitive Price” as used in the Mining Contract.

The dispute, which had arisen in 2008, had escalated because Prodeco had
unilaterally applied its own interpretation, and had failed to pay to Ingeominas an
amount of more than USD 6 M. Ingeominas had reacted by requiring Prodeco to

pay within one month bajo apremio de caducidad, and had rejected Prodeco’s
conciliatory proposal of depositing the disputed amounts in an escrow account.

A. May 2009: The Commitment to Negotiate

The negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas continued, and on 21 May 2009
(a few days after CDJ’s purchase of the 3ha Contract from Mr. Maldonado), both
parties finally executed an Acuerdo de Compromiso [“Commitment to
Negotiate”], in an attempt to solve their dispute.

B. June-—November 2009: Negotiations

Once the Commitment to Negotiate was signed, Ingeominas and Prodeco started
formal negotiations. The negotiation period was extended three times, in
September, October, and November 2009, before finally expiring on 9 December
2009.17

The negotiations revolved around two main issues:

- The general compensation scheme that would be applied under the Mining
Contract [““Compensation Scheme”);

- The coal price to be used for calculating the compensation [“Coal Reference
Price’).

a. The Meeting of the Consejo Directivo of 1 June 2009

On 1 June 2009, Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas’ Director General, informed its
Consejo Directivo of the latest developments in the Prodeco negotiation: he
explained that Ingeominas had notified Prodeco that it was in contractual breach,
and that Prodeco had offered to pay USD 6 M into an escrow account while
discussions were pending. He added that Ingeominas had rejected this proposal, and
in order to move forward, Ingeominas and Prodeco had executed a document, in
which Prodeco agreed to pay the disputed sum by 4 June 2009. The Ministro de
Minas, Mr. Hernan Martinez Torres, then stated that holders of mining titles must
comply with the terms of their concession agreements, and that it was Ingeominas’
task to guarantee that this happened. '

b. Negotiations Start

On 3 June 2009, Prodeco made the agreed payment of more than USD 6 M, and
consequently the 90-day negotiation period started to run.'®? Ingeominas scheduled

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

a kick-off meeting for 12 June 2009 and sent a letter to Prodeco in preparation for
that meeting.?°

The kick-off meeting took place on 12 June 2009. Prodeco submitted an extensive
PowerPoint presentation explaining its position.?°! Claimants proposed to replace
the existing Compensation Scheme (Royalties and GIC) with a single flat royalty
rate based on Prodeco’s actual sale prices. According to Prodeco, this modification
would ultimately generate higher revenues for the State, without impairing the net
present value [“NPV”] of the project for Claimants.”

In response, on 23 June 2009, Ingeominas requested that Prodeco provide a
numerical, detailed and concrete proposal of the requested changes to the
Compensation Scheme, and the analyses, valuations and commitments with respect
to future investments, expansion, and production.

Prodeco presented its proposal at a meeting scheduled for 2 July 2009.7 Prodeco
used a PowerPoint presentation,” in which it offered a single compensation
payment of 10% based on the higher of:

- the actual coal sales price, and
- USD 42.43 per tonne (which was the base price of the 2006 PTI).

According to Prodeco, the proposal, by guaranteeing a minimum price per tonne,
shielded Ingeominas from the risk of potential decreases in coal prices. In a letter
sent two days thereafter, Prodeco again represented to Ingeominas that the proposal
would permit a further expansion of the Mine and would also be advantageous for
Ingeominas and for the Nation.?°°

On 13 July 2009, Ingeominas acknowledged receipt and declared that it was
evaluating Prodeco’s proposal “bajo la salva guarda [sic] de los intereses de la
Nacion y por ende de todos los Colombianos” 2"

c. The Meeting of the Consejo Directivo of 27 July 2009
On 27 July 2009, Adolfo Enrique Alvarez Gonzalez, Technical Director of

Ingeominas briefly informed its Consejo Directivo that it was studying a review of
the remuneration owed under the Prodeco Mining Contract.7°°

It is noteworthy that the minutes of the meeting do not properly reflect the scope of
the negotiations. The Tribunal considers it established that in fact Prodeco and
Ingeominas were discussing not only the Coal Reference Price, but a much wider
range of topics affecting the Compensation Scheme.

d. Continuation of the Negotiations

The next meeting took place on 31 July 2009.7° Mr. Gary Nagle [“Mr. Nagle”],
Prodeco’s Chief Executive Officer at the time,”!° has testified as his recollection of
the topics that were discussed at that meeting: Ingeominas had in the meantime
analysed the proposal submitted by Prodeco, and accepted the application of a flat
rate, albeit at a higher rate of 13%, with the possibility of increasing it to 15% if
prices rose and Prodeco made windfall profits.?!!

Since Mr. Nagle’s “main takeaway” from the meeting was that Ingeominas
expected an improved offer, on 10 August 2009, Prodeco submitted a revised
proposal.

On 27 August 2009, Ingeominas replied to Prodeco’s revised proposal. Ingeominas
explained that its officials were assessing Prodeco’s revised proposal and hoped to
come back with a response at the following meeting.”!”

Prodeco answered on 1 September 2009, explaining that its improved offer was
simply aimed at reflecting the parties’ latest discussions. Prodeco declared that it
was open to discussing Ingeominas’ proposals at the following meeting, which
should also address the fact that the Commitment to Negotiate was about to
expire.?!

As foreseen by Prodeco, the 90-day agreed period for negotiations expired, and on
3 September 2009, Ingeominas officially notified Prodeco that it would resort to
mediation, as envisaged in the Commitment to Negotiate.?'+ But on that same day
Prodeco and Ingeominas reached an agreement to extend the negotiation period
until 30 October 2009, and no mediation was initiated.?!>

On 1 October 2009, the Consejo Directivo met again. The minutes show that the
Prodeco negotiation was discussed in detail, and that Ingeominas’ letter dated
23 September 2009 had in fact been issued at the suggestion of the Consejeros.?'®

2® Doc. R-118. This meeting was initially programmed for 22 July 2009, but it was postponed by
Ingeominas (Doc. R-117).

20 Mr. Nagle served as Prodeco’s CEO from January 2008 to April 2013 (Nagle I, para. 3), after which he
was replaced by Mr. Mark McManus [“Mr. McManus” ] (McManus I, para. 5).

e. Prodeco Submits an NPV Model

Ingeominas and Prodeco held a further meeting on 5 October 2009,”!” and a few
days thereafter, on 9 October, Prodeco submitted a new letter, with additional
explanations.7!®

Prodeco started by justifying why, under the existing Compensation Scheme, it was
not economically feasible to expand the Mine, in terms of NPV. Applying the then
current system, the maximum NPV was achieved at 8 MTA, and for higher
production, the NPV started to decrease, as a result of the progressive
Compensation Scheme agreed upon in the Mining Contract.?!? Prodeco thus
averred that beyond 8 MTA it would be uneconomical further to increase the
capacity of the Mine.

In the letter, Prodeco then submitted its alternative proposal, which it said had been
discussed at the meeting with Ingeominas held on 5 October.

Under this proposal, the then current Compensation Scheme would be retained for
production up to 8 MTA; but for higher production a unified compensation rate of
13% would be applied.

In that case an annual production of 15 MTA would become economical, even if
the increase in production required a capital investment of USD 1.6 Bn. Prodeco
would be prepared to assume such investment, since the NPV of the project
increased to slightly more than USD 200 M. And Ingeominas would also benefit:
the NPV of its take would increase to USD 600 M (again at 12% discount rate).

Analysis by Ingeominas

Ingeominas asked two of its officers — Mr. Giovanny Balcero and Ms. Luz Mireya
Gomez, to analyse Prodeco’s latest proposal.

Mr. Balcero and Ms. Gomez prepared a three-page memorandum, dated 20 October
2009, which reached the following conclusions:?7!

- NPV was a proper financial tool to evaluate long term investment projects; if the
NPV was higher than the required investment, the investment was feasible;

- The model submitted by Prodeco had a positive NPV for annual production
between 8 and 15 MTA and consequently a project foreseeing production in that
range would be financially viable;

- Certain aspects of Prodeco’s model required further clarification;

- Prodeco should submit a sensitivity analysis to confirm the financial viability of
the project.

The report did not address Prodeco’s argument that the NPV of the project was
maximized at a production of 8 MTA, and that for higher production (which
required higher investments) the NPV decreased — and that for Prodeco the best
alternative, with the existing Compensation Scheme, was to limit production at
8 MTA.

On 26 October 2009, Ms. Gémez met with Mr. Johnny Campo, Prodeco’s Projects
Financial Analyst, to discuss her memorandum. On that same day, as requested, Mr.
Campo sent to Mr. Balcero of Ingeominas a sensitivity analysis,?”* reflecting the
impact of the variation of certain factors (discount rate, coal prices, labour costs,
fuel costs, explosive costs) on the NPV of the project at different production
levels,?” supporting the conclusion that “a partir de SMtpy la expansion es inviable
ya que el VPN del proyecto se reduce a partir de este nivel de produccién”.

Thereafter, officers from Prodeco and Ingeominas met several times and jointly ran
different sensitivity models.?7*

f. The Meeting of the Consejo Directivo of 26 October 2009

On 26 October 2009, Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo held a meeting, at which
Prodeco’s proposal was discussed. Ms. Luz Aristizdbal, an officer of Ingeominas,
who would later be involved in the Contraloria proceeding, submitted a report and
gave a detailed explanation of the ongoing negotiations between Prodeco and
Ingeominas. In essence,??>

- She acknowledged that under the existing Compensation Scheme an expansion
of the mine beyond 8 MTA was not viable, because if production was geared up
to (say) 12 MTA the Base Royalty of 7.6% would increase by an Additional
Royalty of 9%, making the expansion not feasible;

- She proposed a new deal, whereby the percentage of Royalties should
progressively increase, until the Mine reached its optimum production level; if
production exceeded that level, the percentage of Royalties should remain fixed;

- She added that if this amendment were not accepted, the Nation would lose the
additional royalties deriving from the expansion of the Mine;

- Finally, she discussed various alternative methods of calculating the Coal
Reference Price on which the Royalties were to be applied.

The Ministro de Minas y Energia, who was present at the meeting, suggested using
the price of sale to the final consumer, instead of indexes, as the Coal Reference
Price for the calculation of royalties. He further questioned why some projects
applied a royalty rate based on FOB Prices, while others used pithead prices. The
Minister concluded that there was a need to conduct a comparative analysis of

prices and levels of production for each contract of Gran Mineria.*°6

g. Second Extension of the Commitment to Negotiate

On 29 October 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas agreed to a new extension of the
Commitment to Negotiate until 30 November 2009.2”

Additional NPV Information

On that same day, Prodeco’s Mr. Campo sent further information to Ingeominas’
official Mr. Balcero, at the latter’s request. The information took the form of a graph
indicating the impact of an expansion of the project on its NPV.?* The graph
confirms that the NPV is maximized at a production of 8 MTA, and that at higher
production rates expenses rise faster than income, resulting in lower NPVs.

Prodeco’s Revised Proposal

On 4 November 2009, Prodeco presented yet another revised proposal to
Ingeominas, on the basis of the information and projections reviewed jointly by
Ingeominas and Prodeco.?”

On 11 November 2009, Prodeco submitted two proposed formulae to calculate the
GIC payments. Prodeco also drew Ingeominas’ attention to the fact that it had been
almost six months since the execution of the Commitment to Negotiate, and that
despite Prodeco’s repeated proposals, Ingeominas had not yet presented any
counter-proposals.7°°

The Meeting of 17 November 2009

Prodeco and Ingeominas representatives met again on 17 November 2009 and
Ingeominas provided Prodeco with some feedback:?*!

-  Ingeominas recognised the need to update the GIC threshold;

- But insisted on using the ICR index as the Coal Reference Price to calculate
Royalties and GIC — a point which Prodeco accepted;

- It proposed that a flat 12.6% royalty rate apply to all production when production
exceeded 8 MTA.

Further Analyses

. On 25 November 2009, Prodeco’s Mr. Campo sent Ingeominas two charts showing
the impact of Ingeominas’ proposals on NPV.

h. The Meeting of the Consejo Directivo of 23 November 2009
. Ingeominas held a further meeting of its Consejo Directivo on 23 November 2009.

Ms. Aristizdbal again made a presentation to the Consejo>** and summarized the

status of the negotiations with Prodeco:

- Ingeominas was proposing to keep the present Compensation Scheme for
production of up to 8 MTA and to apply a fixed rate of 12.6% for production
above that threshold;

- Ingeominas acknowledged that the costs on which the GIC was based had to be
updated, to take into account inflation; there was however no agreement on the

identification of the proper indexes.?*

. The Directors did not express any opposition to these proposals; they simply asked
to be kept informed of the progress in the negotiations.?**

i. Third Extension of the Commitment to Negotiate

. On 27 November 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed a third, and last,
extension of the Commitment to Negotiate, until 9 December 2009.735

THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT: EXECUTION
A. December 2009: Execution of the Initial Version

. The negotiations continued at a meeting held on 3 December 2009. In the course of
that meeting, agreement seemed within reach. Prodeco accepted Ingeominas’
proposals:?°

- A 12.6% flat royalty rate would apply on all production in excess of 8 MTA;

- The ICR reference prices should be weighted to determine a Coal Reference
Price to calculate Royalties and GIC;

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- The GIC tables should be indexed to the Colombian consumer price index and
not to international indexes;

- Prodeco’s proposal that GIC payments be due only where production costs
exceed 75% of sales prices was rejected.

Having apparently reached an accord, on 9 December 2009 — the last day of validity
of the Commitment to Negotiate — Prodeco and Ingeominas met and executed an
eighth amendment to the Mining Contract [“Initial Version of the Eighth
Amendment”), which:?*”

- Maintained the existing Compensation Scheme for production volumes up to
8 MTA;

- Established a 12.6% flat royalty rate on all coal produced in excess of 8 MTA,
applied on the FOB reference price at the Colombian port;

- Determined that the FOB reference price was to be calculated applying a formula
which consisted of the weighted average of ICR prices in force 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
and 18 months before the date of each shipment (the so-called lags), adjusted by
calorific power;

- Seta table with updated thresholds to calculate GIC payments based on the FOB
reference prices; these thresholds would be updated according to Colombian
inflation.

The Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment also provided that Prodeco had to pay
approximately USD 20.8 M to Ingeominas, to settle outstanding payments derived
from the Definitive Price provision, but that such payment should not be understood
as Prodeco’s acknowledgement of Ingeominas’ interpretation.”°*

The Initial Version would enter into force upon its registration at the National
Mining Registry, and would be deemed to take effect on 1 January 2010.7

Prodeco and Ingeominas initialled and signed three copies of the Initial Version of
the Eighth Amendment.2“° Mr. Ballesteros requested, however, that Prodeco leave
its signed copy with Ingeominas, so that, as a courtesy, he could explain the contents
of the agreement at the Consejo Directivo meeting scheduled for the following day,
and Prodeco complied with that request.7*!

B. The Meeting of the Consejo Directivo of 10 December 2009

. On 10 December 2009, Ingeominas held a meeting of its Consejo Directivo,*” and

Ms. Aristizdbal again appeared and submitted a report summarizing the terms of
the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.”? She attached a chart, which
compared the level of Royalties in an 8 MTA and in an expansion scenario,
assuming a USD 70 coal price:?4+

Pree et Ee aac
Ce er eee Scere ine ere

 

. In accordance with this chart, in the 8 MTA scenario the Royalties collected by

Ingeominas would remain stable at USD 80 M per year between 2009 and 2015. In
the alternative expansion scenario, applying the new Royalties foreseen in the Initial
Version of the Eighth Amendment, Ingeominas’ income would dip in 2009 (to
approximately USD 70 M) and in 2010 (to approximately USD 75 M), but would
then rise to USD 105 M in 2011 and to more than USD 120 M in 2012-2015.

. It is unclear what exactly happened next at the meeting of the Consejo Directivo.

Minister Hernan Martinez Torres has testified in the Contraloria proceeding that
he disagreed with the signed Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, that he asked
that his disagreement be included in the minutes of the meeting, and that it was
agreed to create a task force to analyse whether the changes were in the interest of
the Nation.“ The official minutes simply say that the Minister and the remaining
members requested that the issue be re-examined with more detail taking into
account the national interest.74°

. Summing up, what seems to have happened is that, although legally speaking the

authorization of the Consejo Directivo was not necessary for the execution of an
amendment to the Mining Contract, Director Ballesteros did not feel comfortable
going forward without the support of his Board, and consequently agreed to review

amendment was in the best interest of the Nation.

C. December 2009: Ingeominas Denies Registration at the Mining Registry

Faced with Ingeominas’ silence for a week, on 16 December 2009 Prodeco sent a
letter demanding that Ingeominas return Prodeco’s signed copy of the Initial
Version of the Eighth Amendment.”*”

Ingeominas replied to Prodeco on 21 December 2009, saying that, in coordination
with the Ministro de Minas y Energia, Ingeominas was making a final review of the
Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment. Ingeominas noted that the Consejo
Directivo was the entity in charge of running and managing Ingeominas, and of
defining its policies, plans and programs, together with the Director General.
Hence, Ingeominas informed that it would communicate its decision regarding the
Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment in the second half of January 2010.74*

On 30 December 2009, Prodeco paid Ingeominas USD 20.8 M, as required under
the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.?*? A few days later, Prodeco once
again requested its signed copy of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.?”

On 18 January 2010, Ingeominas finally delivered to Prodeco a signed copy of the
Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, but with multiple stamps stating:?>!

“SIN VIGENCIA POR FALTA DE INSCRIPCION EN EL REGISTRO
MINERO NACIONAL AL CONSIDERARSE LESIVO PARA EL ESTADO”.

In the cover letter, Ingeominas explained that the Initial Version of the Eighth
Amendment was contrary to the interests of the Nation and that registration at the
Mining Registry had been denied.?*

Ingeominas added that it would promptly reimburse Prodeco the USD 20.8 M
already paid.

Finally, Ingeominas invited Prodeco to an immediate and joint review of the
pending aspects of the negotiations.”°?

D. January 2010: Execution of the Eighth Amendment

Upon receipt of Ingeominas’ letter dated 18 January 2010, negotiations between the
parties resumed.

Ingeominas suggested minor adjustments to the royalty scheme. Namely,
Ingeominas proposed maintaining the existing Royalty rate up to 8 MTA (i.e., a
maximum flat 12.6% rate at 8 MTA), but that each additional MTA be subject to
an additional 1% rate (i.e. the 9'" MTA only would be subject to a 13.6% royalty
rate, the 10" MTA only to a 14.6% royalty rate, and so on).?>4

Prodeco acquiesced to Ingeominas’ proposed modifications.*>°

Hence, four days later, on 22 January 2010, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the
final version of the Eighth Amendment,?*® which was registered with the National
Mining Registry three days later.

The Parties agree that, save for the change to the new Royalty schedule suggested
by Ingeominas, the Initial and final versions of the Eighth Amendment are

practically identical.?>7

E. Content of the Eighth Amendment

The Eighth Amendment changed the Compensation Scheme and the Coal
Reference Price.

Considerandos

The Eighth Amendment starts with six extensive Considerandos.

Considerando 3 explains that on 21 May 2009 Prodeco and Ingeominas signed the
Commitment to Negotiate regarding the Definitive Price dispute and “otros temas

mencionados en dicho acuerdo de compromiso”.

Considerando 5 then describes the negotiations which took place and itemises the
five areas where agreement had been reached:?°*

- The first agreement was the decision not to change the Compensation Scheme

in the Mining Contract for production, up to 8 MTA;

- The second was to establish a limit on the percentage of Royalties to be applied

for production above 8 MTA “de manera que sea factible la expansion del
proyecto”;

- The third was to update the values used to calculate GIC payments;

- The fourth was to clarify the formula used in the determination of the Additional
Royalty;

- And the fifth was to determine the Coal Reference Price using ICR, with a
formula to introduce time lags reflecting Prodeco’s actual sales price.

The final Considerando sets out the goals of the Eighth Amendment:?°°
“6. Que con el presente acuerdo se garantizan los intereses del Estado y la
viabilidad de la expansion del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el fundamento
de la negociaci6n entre las partes”.

Clauses?

Clause 1 of the Eighth Amendment modifies clause 14.1 of the Mining Contract
regarding the calculation of Royalties.

Under the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco undertakes to pay a Base Royalty of 7.6%
for production up to 3 MTA, and an Additional Royalty of 1% for every 1 MTA
increase in production, up to 8 MTA (i.e. 12.6%), on the totality of the coal sold.?°!
This was the scheme originally agreed upon in the Mining Contract.

Once production exceeds 8 MTA, the Additional Royalty ceases to be levied on all
the annual production. Instead, the 1% incremental royalty is applied only to the
incremental MTA of production:

- an additional 1% for production between 8 and 9 MTA,

- an additional 2% for production between 9 and 10 MTA,

- an additional 3% for production between 10 and 11 MTA, and so on.

This means that if total production is 9 MTA, a 12.6% royalty rate applies to the
first 8 MTA and a 13.6% royalty rate applies to the 9'" MTA only.

Although the parties did not establish a limit on production, no production beyond
15 MTA was envisaged.

In addition, the Eighth Amendment also slightly modifies the provision of
clause 14.1 related to the royalties applicable to the coal sold in the Colombian
national market.

Clause 2 of the Eighth Amendment modifies clause 14.2 of the Mining Contract. It
provides that the Base Royalty shall be paid monthly, within ten days of the end of

the month, at the applicable exchange rate. As to the Additional Royalty, applicable
when production exceeds both 3 MTA and 8 MTA, it shall be paid annually, within
one month of the end of each year.

Clause 3 modifies clause 14.3 of the Mining Contract, which relates to the Coal
Reference Price for the payment of royalties.

Pro memoria: The Seventh Amendment had established that if the coal exported by
Prodeco came exclusively from the Mine, the Coal Reference Price for payment of
Royalties and GIC would be the higher of (i) the FOB Colombian port price for
Colombian steam coal for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for
calorific value [defined as the “FOB Price”], and (ii) the actual sale price.”

The Eighth Amendment introduces two relevant changes:

- First, it does away with the “higher of”; consequently the Coal Reference Price

is based only on the FOB Price in Colombian Port;

- Second, it creates a new formula, which introduces a time lag; in essence the

formula takes into account the FOB Prices in the 18 months preceding the
calculation date, weighted by Prodeco’s sales in the respective periods, on the
basis of annual weighing coefficients, established ex ante (before 15 January of
each year) by an independent auditor appointed by Ingeominas on 31 October
of each year; these same coefficients are then also used to correct the
compensation paid in the year in question.

Transition Period

Under the new pricing formula, on each given date the Coal Reference Price is
established by taking in consideration not only the FOB Price on such date, but also
the FOB Prices which were applicable in the previous 18 months. This system of
calculation creates a difficulty: how to calculate the weighing coefficient for the
first year of application of the Eighth Amendment? Indeed, no independent auditor
had yet been appointed who could have established the coefficients ex ante.

Just as in the Initial Version, the Eighth Amendment came up with a solution called
the periodo de transicion [Transition Period”]: during the first year of application
of the Eighth Amendment, the weighing coefficients were already set by Prodeco
and Ingeominas at 0.333. These coefficients were to be applied to the FOB Price
which was applicable three, six, and nine months before each determination date.

This transitory regime was to be applied in the period between 1 January 2010 and
31 December 2010; for this reason, this period was defined as the Transition Period.

As will be explained below, the Transition Period would become highly relevant,
because in the Contraloria’s Fiscal Liability Proceeding the damage caused to the
State is calculated using the Transition Period as the yardstick.

Clause 4 modifies clause 14.4 of the Mining Contract and defines the information
regarding the payment of royalties that Prodeco has to provide to Ingeominas on a
monthly basis.

Clause 5 modifies clause 43 of the Third Amendment to the Mining Contract, and
eliminates Annexes 9 and 9A, which had been included in the Mining Contract by
virtue of the Sixth Amendment.

Clause 6 modifies clauses 15.1.1 of the Mining Contract:

- Clause 15.1.1 establishes new FOB price thresholds to calculate the GIC
payments, as follows:

 

   
 
 

c

% Aplicable a
diferencia
59.94 = FOB <
67.43 < FOB < ‘

FOB > 89.91

     
 

 

 

 

 

- Clause 15.1.2 provides that Prodeco and Ingeominas agree that these thresholds
shall be adjusted quarterly by indexing to the Colombian consumer price index,
as published by the DANE, the Colombian State entity in charge of statistics-?©
even though the GIC thresholds are expressed in USD;?°*

- Clause 15.1.3 establishes that the GIC shall be paid quarterly, within ten days of
the end of the quarter;

- Clause 15.4 determines that the GIC shall be paid on the basis of the Coal
Reference Price set out in the new clause 14.3.

Pursuant to Clause 7, Prodeco agrees to pay approximately USD 20.8 M® to
Ingeominas to settle the outstanding amounts resulting from Ingeominas’
interpretation of the Definitive Price term — without agreeing to such interpretation.

In turn, in Clause 8, Ingeominas declares that:°°
“Habida cuenta que con los acuerdos consagrados en los numerales

anteriores se soluciona y por ende deja de existir la controversia que dio
origen a la suscripcién del Acuerdo de Compromiso y del presente otrost, y

Clause 9 provides that the Eighth Amendment shall be deemed to have entered into
effect on 1 January 2010.

In Clause 10, Prodeco and Ingeominas undertake to review the Coal Reference
Price formula within a year, to consider applying the API2-BC17 indexes.

Finally, Clause 11 determines that the Eighth Amendment shall enter into force
upon its registration at the National Mining Registry.

The Eighth Amendment was duly registered in the Mining Registry on 25 January
2010,7°7 and consequently entered into force on that date, with retroactive effects
as of 1 January.

F, The Meeting of the Consejo Directivo of 26 January 2010

On 26 January 2010, Ingeominas again held a meeting of its Consejo Directivo.
This time it was Mr. Ballesteros himself who informed the board members that the
Eighth Amendment had been signed “teniendo en cuenta las sugerencias emitidas
por ellos en consejos anteriores”. He then provided detailed information on the
agreed changes.?°*

G. January 2010: The Viability Study

At some point in January 2010, Ingeominas prepared a study of the “Viabilidad
para la suscripcién del Otrosi No. 8 modificatorio del Contrato 044-89” [the
“Viability Study”], which summarized the arguments which Ingeominas had taken
into consideration when negotiating with Prodeco.””

The 8-page document was signed by Ms. Luz Aristizabal, Ms. Luz Mireya Goméz,
Ms. Melida Cabezas and Mr. Giovanny Balcero and was dated “el mes de enero de
2010”.?” It is likely that the Viability Study was signed after the execution of the
Eighth Amendment.

354. The main conclusion of the Viability Study is the following:?”!

“Con la suscripcion del otrosi descrito, se garantizan los intereses del Estado
y la viabilidad de la expansién del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el
fundamento de la negociacion entre las partes”. [Emphasis added]

355. And this conclusion is explained thus:?”*
“La razén de ser de la negociacién dentro del Contrato 044-89 con

PRODECO S.A, en términos practicos radica en que de no negociar con el
titular minero, la interpretaci6n de algunas de las cldusulas contractuales que

para el pais y sus diferentes regiones, sin dejar de lado las obras de
infraestructura que sin ella se dejarian de realizar”. [Emphasis added]

 

356. The Viability Study explained that Prodeco had asked to review, inter alia, the
following elements of the Mining Contract:

- the price index for compensation,

- FOB price vs. pithead prices,

- the Additional Royalty, and

- GIC.

The Viability Study acknowledged that Prodeco had presented several proposals
and summarized these proposals in broad terms. The Viability Study also noted that

the clauses of mining contracts could be freely negotiated between the mining
authority and the contractor.?”?

357. The Viability Study found that the negotiations with Prodeco had the following
benefits for the State:?”4
- The clause regarding the Additional Royalty, which could give rise to a legal
dispute, was no longer ambiguous: it was now clear that from 3 to 8 MTA, the
Additional Royalty was applicable to all the coal sold and that the Coal
Reference Price for the calculation of the Additional Royalty was not the price
of the invoices;

- For production in excess of 8 MTA, the increase in Royalties was capped, but

such limitation was necessary to guarantee the expansion of the Calenturitas
Mine and, consequently, the economic development of the region;

- The GIC thresholds had to be updated to take into consideration inflation, since

production costs exceeded USD 42 per tonne of coal, surpassing the GIC
threshold; the threshold had to be indexed towards the future, and for this
purpose, after extensive analysis, the Colombian consumer price index was
selected;

- Any doubts regarding the Coal Reference Price for the payment of Royalties and

GIC were cleared up; the new Coal Reference Price was now based on the ICR
index.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

358. The Viability Study also explained that Ingeominas had compared all the mining
projects with production exceeding 8 MTA in the past 22 months and had found
that Prodeco would always generate more revenues for the State than other projects.
The Study contained the following chart in support of this finding:?”>

C. June 2010: The 2010 PTI

In the meantime, Prodeco was preparing an updated long-term PTI, which was due
in May 2009,””* but had been delayed due to the negotiations between the Parties.”””

The 2006 PTI

Pro memoria: The 2006 PTI had been prepared before execution of the Seventh
Amendment (which extended the life of the Mining Contract until 2035)8° and of
the Eighth Amendment (which changed the Compensation Scheme). The
exploration in Sectors B and D of the Mine and the diversion of the Calenturitas
River also took place after 2006.78!

In the 2006 PTI Prodeco had planned to expand the Mine’s total coal production to
116 MT. Annual production would gradually increase from 4.4 MTA in 2007 to
10 MTA from 2010 through 2019.7*

The 2006 PTI also foresaw an investment of USD 500.1 M in the period 2007-2010
(broken down as USD 196.4 M for equipment, USD 114.6 M for railway, USD 85.2
M for infrastructure and USD 103.9 M for port and sundry investments).

By 2010, these investments had mostly been carried out: the stock of investment
had increased between 2006 and 2010 from USD 162.5 M*? to USD 644.2 M,28+
i.e. by USD 481.7 M.

The 2010 PTI

In June 2010, Prodeco delivered to Ingeominas an updated long-term PTI [the
2010 PTI”],”* pursuant to which it expected to achieve the following objectives:

Annual production: Annual production would reach 6.4 MTA in 2010, rise to 7.6
MTA in 2011 (2006 PTI: 4.4 MTA), and progressively increase until reaching a
maximum of 14.2 MTA in 2019 (2006 PTI: 10 MTA), and then progressively
decrease until 2032 (2006 PTI: no production after 2019).?8°

Mine-life production: Prodeco expected to produce approximately 254 MT of coal
from 2010 through 203278 (more than doubling the 2006 PTI estimation of 116
MT between 2007 and 2019).

Mine-life investment: USD 1,477 M2"! (2006 PTI: USD 1,184 M).222

Net present value: the Mine offered a NPV of USD 116 M (2006 PTI: USD 98 M)
(both at a 15% discount rate), assuming costs of USD 47.26 per tonne (2006 PTI:
USD 24.79) and a coal price of USD 55 per tonne?’ (2006 PTI: USD 42.58).

Mine-life Royalties: estimated at USD 1,782 M?* (2006 PTI: 671 M).

The 2010 PTI was approved by Ingeominas on 6 December 2010, after asking
Prodeco to make minor modifications.?°>

D. 2010-2015: Promised Investments

As enshrined in its preamble, the Eighth Amendment had two main goals:
- To guarantee that the Mine expansion was viable, and

- To maximize the income for the State.

The Preamble expresses this idea with the following words:

“[...] con el presente acuerdo se_garantizan los intereses del Estado y la

viabilidad de la expansi6n del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el fundamento
de la negociacién entre las partes”. [Emphasis added]

In other words: under the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco accepted the commitment
to carry out significant investments in the Mine and to expand its production
capabilities; the increased production would generate additional Royalties, with the
end result that Colombia would receive a higher revenue.

As Mr. Nagle said in his testimony, the investments and production levels projected
in the 2010 PTI were “negotiation commitment(s)” that “led to them [Ingeominas]

288 The 2010 PTI is not very clear as to the initial date of the five-year period; the PTI, proposed in June
2010 and approved in December 2010, simply says that the amounts are to be invested “en los préximos 5
aiios” (p. 191). The Tribunal assumes this to mean in the period 2011 through 2015.

agreeing and us [Prodeco] agreeing to this Otros¢”.*°’ And Minister Martinez Torres
confirmed that through the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco committed to increase
production beyond 8 MTA.”

What were the concrete levels of investment and production promised by Prodeco?
The quantified objectives were not set forth in the Eighth Amendment, but rather in
the 2010 PTI — a semi-contractual document proposed by Prodeco and approved by

Ingeominas in June 2010.

According to the 2010 PTI, Prodeco undertook to invest USD 654 M in the
five-year period 2011 through 2015, broken down in:?””

- USD 243 M for mining equipment,

- USD 7.6 M for railways,

- USD 40M for infrastructure,

- USD 301 M for port, and

- USD 62.4 for sundry investments.

Claimants say that in fact they invested much higher amounts: USD 465 M in 2011,
USD 300 M in 2012, USD 75 M in 2013 and USD 45 M in 2014,* totaling
USD 885 M. These figures are not challenged by Respondent.*”! Prodeco

consequently invested in the period 2011-2014 some USD 231 M more than
anticipated in 2010.

382. The Tribunal concludes that Prodeco indeed complied with its investment
commitments under the Eighth Amendment and the 2010 PTI.

383.

384. Actual production for the period 2010-2018 was thus only 86.1 MT, while the 2010
PTI had foreseen production of more than 100 MT.

385. One reason for this decrease in production is that in 2016 Prodeco performed a
geological reappraisal of the Mine, with negative results. In accordance with the

new studies, the available reserves had to be reduced from 254 MT (the amount
foreseen in the 2010 PTI) to 170 MT. This reduction in available coal was reflected
in the 2016 PTI, which was approved by Ingeominas.*”7

386. Production in 2015 and 2016 was also disincentivized by very low international
prices for coal, and the years 2016 and 2017 turned out to be extremely wet, thus
impairing mining activities.°*

Royalties

387. Royalties paid in the period 2006-2018 amounted to USD 938.6 M, more than half
of the total estimated in the 2010 PTI for the period 2010-2035 (USD 1.782 M)*°5

(7) THE FISCAL LIABILITY PROCEEDING

388. The Contraloria is an autonomous agency of the Colombian State, entrusted with
the supervision and control of the use of public funds.*°’ The main task of the
agency is to establish what the law calls “responsabilidad fiscal”, i.e. the
responsibility of civil servants and private individuals for the mismanagement of
public funds or assets.*°°

389. Fiscal responsibility is established through an administrative procedure, which is
initiated, conducted, and decided by the Contraloria itself.

390. Ms. Soraya Vargas, who acted as Contralora Delegada Intersectorial de Regalias
adscrita a la Unidad de Investigaciones Especiales contra la Corrupcion from 2013

This fiscal liability proceeding may be preceded by a preliminary investigation
(indagacién preliminar), although this is not mandatory.*!' The proceedings are
divided into two phases: the first one is preceded by a formal decision (“decision
de apertura”) and requires that the allegedly responsible civil servants or private
persons be heard. Thereafter the Contraloria may decide to close the file, or to issue
an “Auto de imputacion” against certain persons. In the second phase evidence is
marshalled, leadings to the fallo, either absolving or declaring the fiscal liability of
those imputed and ordering those found responsible to indemnify the Republic for
the damage caused to it.

Nature of the Proceso de Respot lidad Fiscal

The Proceso de Responsabilidad Fiscal is a purely administrative and inquisitorial
procedure, in which the Contraloria investigates the facts and then issues a decision
(fallo). The Contraloria itself has described it in the following words:*!”

“[...] el proceso de responsabilidad fiscal es un procedimiento administrativo
de cardcter patrimonial que persigue la reparacién de un daiio causado al
patrimonio del Estado por un servidor ptiblico o un particular en ejercicio de
gestion fiscal 0 con ocasién de esta como consecuencia de una conducta
dolosa o gravemente culposa”.

An important trait of the Proceso de Responsabilidad Fiscal is that the Contraloria
acts simultaneously as prosecutor and as judge vis-d-vis the civil servant or private
individual who is being investigated. In one of its decisions, the Contraloria has
acknowledged this fact and has provided the following description of how the
Proceso develops:*'

 

31! Doc. C-71, Art. 39: “Si no existe certeza sobre la ocurrencia del hecho, la causacién del dafto
patrimonial con ocasién de su acaecimiento, la entidad afectada y la determinacién de los presuntos
responsables, podrd ordenarse indagacién preliminar por un término maximo de seis (6) meses, al cabo
de los cuales solamente procedera el archivo de las diligencias 0 la apertura del proceso de
responsabilidad fiscal”.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

“[...] en el proceso de responsabilidad fiscal no opera el concepto de partes
que aparece cabalmente disefiado en el proceso judicial, en el cual existe un
juez, que es el encargado de dirimir la controversia, y unas partes con
intereses opuestos. En la id Iministrativa, la adi ‘acion funge
como juez y como parte frente a un administrado que es el sujeto que puede
resultar_afectado_con la decisién_que se adopte dentro de la _respectiva
actuaci6n”. [Emphasis added]

Notwithstanding the fact that this is an administrative procedure, the law authorizes
the Contraloria to order the preliminary attachment of assets belonging to the civil
servant or private person under investigation (without requiring judicial
approval).?!4

The Proceso will eventually lead to a decision (fallo), in which the Contraloria (by
itself, and without the participation of a judge) decides whether the indicted person
is to be absolved or to be found guilty. In this latter situation, the fallo will order
the person declared fiscalmente responsable immediately to pay the amount
required to compensate the Republic for the damage it suffered.*!°

It is important to bear in mind that the fallo is an administrative act, taken by a civil
servant. As the Contraloria acknowledged in one of its decisions:*!°

“[...] ni el Contralor General de la Republica, ni los contralores delegados
intersectoriales administran justicia en nombre de la Repiiblica de Colombia,
no ejercen funciones jurisdiccionales, esto es, no son jueces, y los procesos de
responsabilidad fiscal se adelantan en ejercicio de sus funciones de control

[..

After its issuance by the Contralor Delegado (and its appeal to the Contralor
General)*"" the fallo becomes final. If the civil servant or particular that has been
found laible disagrees with the Contraloria’s findings, the fallo may then be
challenged before the Colombian Courts through a procedimiento contencioso
administrativo,*'® but this review of the fallo by the Colombian Courts occurs ex
post.

A. The Preliminary Investigation

A few months after the execution of the Eighth Amendment, a scandal erupted
concerning allegedly corrupt practices in Ingeominas.*!°

In light of the scandal, but also of audits which the Contraloria had been conducting
in Ingeominas,*”° on 8 October 2010, the newly appointed Contralora General de

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

la Reptiblica, Ms. Sandra Morelli, decided to constitute an Equipo Especial de
Reaccién Inmediata [{“Immediate Reaction Team”), with the goal of:*?!

“[...] analizar la situacién que comporta un especial interés nacional y que
eventualmente podria comprometer el patrimonio ptiblico del Estado en lo
referente a las presuntas irregularidades en el manejo contractual que
INGEOMINAS le ha dado a los contratos con la Sociedad CERRO MATOSO
S.A., Sociedad DRUMMOND y Sociedad C.I PRODECO S.A.”.

Consequently, on 19 October 2010, the Contraloria opened an indagacién
preliminar into Ingeominas [‘Preliminary Investigation”].*”? The Investigation
would start with a visit to the offices of Ingeominas, to examine all the documents
related to the contracts of Cerro Matoso and Drummond (also suspected mining
companies), and of Prodeco.*??

On 20 October 2010, the Immediate Reaction Team visited the offices of
Ingeominas and asked for the files regarding Drummond, Cerro Matoso, and
Prodeco, and particularly documents post-dating 2006.*** Ingeominas delivered a
series of documents, as requested.?°

On 27 October 2010, the Contraloria interviewed two Ingeominas officers who had
been involved in the negotiations of the Eighth Amendment, Ms. Luz Aristizabal
and Mr. Giovanny Balcero.*”° Pro memoria, these individuals had signed the
Viability Study; Ms. Aristizabal had been in charge of making presentations to
Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo, and Mr. Balcero had prepared a memorandum in
October 2009 regarding Prodeco’s NPV.

Over the following months, Ingeominas replied to several requests for information
from the Immediate Reaction Team.*””

In March 2011, the Immediate Reaction Team finalized its report,*?8 which was
divided into three sub-reports, for each of the mining projects. Ms. Johanna Tovar
Silva was in charge of the report on Prodeco [the “Tovar Silva Report”].*°

The Tovar Silva Report recounted the history of the Mining Contract and the
amendments thereto. It also summarized the negotiations between Prodeco and
Ingeominas regarding the Eighth Amendment.

406. The Tovar Silva Report concluded that:

Prodeco had not marshalled evidence proving that the mining project would be
unviable without the Eighth Amendment;**”
There had been no juridical, technical, or financial reasons to modify the
economic conditions of the Mining Contract;

Ingeominas had failed to properly analyse the impact of the Eighth
Amendment;*?!

The modifications to the compensation scheme under the Eighth Amendment
were detrimental for Colombia, since in 2010 Colombia had received less
revenues than it would have received under the previous compensation scheme.

407.

a

The Tovar Silva Report based its finding on the so-called Transition Period
contemplated in the Eighth Amendment, which was the period between 1 January
and 31 December 2010.

408. Ms. Tovar Silva’s analysis draws attention to one of the main issues confronted in
the Contraloria’s analysis: how to calculate the damage caused in a long-term
contract. As Ms. Tovar Silva explains, in this type of contract there is a possibility
that losses in one year are offset by gains in succeeding years — thus making the
calculation of the damage caused more uncertain. To resolve this difficulty, Ms.
Tovar Silva decided to focus on the one-year “periodo de transicion” foreseen in
the Eighth Amendment, which in her opinion “se ha consolidado plenamente”, and
then to calculate the damage as the loss of income suffered by the Republic in that
period — disregarding all possible events in subsequent years.

Prodeco would not be notified of the Tovar Silva Report until August 2012"? (more
than a year later).

B. The Contraloria Initiates the Fiscal Liability Proceeding

410. On 10 May 2011, the Contraloria closed the Preliminary Investigation**? and
decided to start Fiscal Liability Proceeding against:***

Prodeco, and

Mr. José Fernando Ceballos, Ingeominas’ Director del Servicio Minero, who
had signed the Eighth Amendment on behalf of Ingeominas.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

411. The Contraloria based this decision on the conclusions of the Tovar Silva
Report.*?> The Contraloria found that all the audited mining contracts (including
those of Drummond and Cerro Matoso) contained irregularities, but that only
Prodeco’s contract had actually caused damage to the State’s finances and could
give rise to fiscal responsibility.**°

412. The Proceedings sought to collect COP 51.35 billion (approximately USD 29 M at
the exchange rate of the time),**7 which was calculated as the difference between
the Royalties and GIC that Prodeco would have paid during the Transition Period
under the old regime, and those actually paid under the Eighth Amendment.?*

413. The Contraloria explained that it was pursuing Mr. Ceballos because Ingeominas
was in charge of collecting royalties and compensation, which, according to the
Colombian Constitucién Politica, are resources of the State.**?

414. The Contraloria also found that it could pursue Prodeco for two reasons:**°
- Because Prodeco was the “orientador” of the Eighth Amendment, and

- Because it provided information to Ingeominas, which Ingeominas used in its
“evaluacion técnica y econémica”.

415. According to the Contraloria, Prodeco was not simply a third party, whose actions
were limited to paying compensation to Ingeominas; on the contrary, Prodeco had
a close and necessary relation with Ingeominas’ fiscal management and hence
should be made responsible through the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.**!

416. A few days later, Prodeco was notified of the start of the Fiscal Liability
Proceeding.*4”

C. Depositions

417. Because the Contraloria must ensure due process rights in its Fiscal Liability
Proceeding, including inter alia the right to present a defence and to be heard,*?
the Contraloria called Mr. Ceballos and a representative of Prodeco to depose.

418. On 9 June 2011, Mr. Ceballos declared to the Contraloria that:*4+

419.

420.

- He had worked as Director del Servicio Minero from November 2009 to August
2010 and by the time he joined the process, Prodeco and Ingeominas had already
conducted extensive negotiations (pro memoria, the Commitment to Negotiate
was signed in May 2009 and the Eighth Amendment in January 2010);

- Both Mr. Ballesteros and the Consejo Directivo, including the Ministro de Minas
y Energia, had always been informed about Prodeco’s proposals and the
analyses that were being conducted;

- The employees of the Subdireccién de Fiscalizacién y Ordenamiento Minero**
in charge of the Eighth Amendment were competent to interpret the mining
legislation and to conduct the necessary analysis; in January 2010, these
employees had prepared a Viability Study supporting the viability of the Eighth
Amendment;

- The Eighth Amendment had been the object of a detailed analysis and there had
been no rushed decisions:*4°

“[...] el otrosi No. 8 no fue un documento que aparecié de un momento a
otro, ni que lo hubiera firmado de manera aislada sino que fue el producto
de una accion previamente analizada discutida al interior de Ingeominas,
teniendo en cuenta las diferentes propuestas presentadas por Prodeco y
siempre teniendo en la mira buscar condiciones mds favorables para el
Estado”.

- Prodeco’s proposed expansion of the Calenturitas Mine and the new
compensation scheme would, in the long-run, generate much higher revenues to
the State, compared to the previous regime.

In addition, Mr. Ceballos delivered the January 2010 Viability Study and asked that
the Contraloria call the four Ingeominas employees in charge of the Eighth
Amendment to testify.**7

Two days later, Ms. Margarita Zuleta, an officer of Prodeco, who had signed the
Eighth Amendment on the company’s behalf, was also called to give her statement
to the Contraloria. Ms. Zuleta described the negotiations between Prodeco and

la Constitucién Politica y a los contenidos en el Cédigo Contencioso Administrative”. See also Vargas I,
para. 20.

4 Doc. C-128, pp. 1-2.

5 Mr. Ceballos said that these employees were Ms. Luz Marina Aristizabal (engineer), Ms. Luz Mireya
Gomez Rios (economist), Ms. Mélida Andrea Cabezas (legal counsel) and Mr. Giovanny Balcero
(engineer).

Ingeominas and explained the rationale behind the Eighth Amendment.**
Ms. Zuleta explained:*4?

“Finalmente creo que es importante tener en cuenta que el proyecto
Calenturitas iba a producir Carbén solo hasta 8 millones de toneladas y que
el otrosi No. 8 permitié a Prodeco expandir su operacién por encima de 8
millones de ladas, lo cual requiere de importantes inversiones en equipo
y_personal las cuales _nunca_hubieran sido _efectuadas _si_el VPN de la
expansion hubiera sido inferior a cero. En consecuencia, la Nacién con el

otrosi No. 8 tiene un ingreso adicional en regalia y contraprestaciones
consistente en las contraprestaciones aplicables a los tonelajes superiores a
8 millones de toneladas al afio. Por lo cual Prodeco considera que el otrosi
No. 8 en ningtin caso implica un detrimento para la Naci6n por el contrario
implica unos ingresos adicionales derivados de la explotaci6n adicional a 8
millones de toneladas al afio. Una vez el otrosi No. 8 fue perfeccionado,
Prodeco_present6_a Ingeominas un plan de trabajo de inversiones para
explotar hasta 15 millones de toneladas al afio”. [Emphasis added]

 

Ms. Zuleta concluded that the Contraloria should employ financial advisors to
study the case in detail and that Prodeco’s team was available to answer any
questions of the Contraloria.*°

In August 2011, Prodeco sent a letter to the Contraloria, explaining in detail the
negotiation process between Prodeco and Ingeominas and the motivations behind
the Eighth Amendment. Prodeco argued that it had not caused damage to the State
and requested that the Contraloria close the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.**!

D. Statements by Officers of Ingeominas and the Ministry of Mines

In light of Mr. Ceballos’ request for further evidence, in late September 2011 the
Contraloria summoned several officers of Ingeominas and the Ministry of Mines
and Energy to testify.**? The Contraloria also ordered the production of a technical
report by an economics specialist with knowledge of the energy sector.*°

Between 24 and 26 October 2011, the Contraloria deposed the Ingeominas officials
who had signed the Viability Study (as explained in detail below, a. to d.) and an
employee of the Ministry of Mines (e.). Before testifying, these witnesses were
required to swear to tell the truth and the Contraloria informed them of the
consequences of perjury.*** Counsel for Prodeco and Mr. Ceballos, and Mr.
Ceballos himself, were present at these depositions.*>>

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

(a) Ms. Aristizabal — who had already given a statement during the Preliminary
Investigation — declared that there had been numerous meetings between Prodeco
and Ingeominas, although not all were documented, to discuss an amendment to the
Mining Contract. She further confirmed that Prodeco’s costs had significantly
increased between 2003 and 2008 and that under the previous compensation scheme
it would not have been possible to expand the Mine. Ms. Aristizabal also noted that
Prodeco was paying the highest royalties in comparison with other projects. Finally,
she said that she had handed several documents to the Immediate Reaction Team
that were not part of the file of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.*°°

(b) Ms. Luz Mireya Gémez — who together with Mr. Balcero had prepared
Ingeominas’ memorandum of October 2009 — declared that there had been weekly
meetings between Prodeco and Ingeominas to discuss Prodeco’s proposals and that
Mr. Ballesteros and Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo had always been kept informed
of the negotiations. Ms. Gomez also confirmed that there had been a significant
increase in coal production costs in the past ten years. Ms. Gémez explained that
Prodeco and Ingeominas had agreed that the GIC threshold would be adjusted
quarterly by reference to the Colombian consumer price index, because it resulted
in lower increases in prices than other indexes. Finally, she said that:*°”

“En el momento en que se realiz6 la negociacion del otrosi no existia un
procedimiento en el Instituto para adelantar este tipo de negociaciones y con
ocasion de un plan de mejoramiento (posterior a la fecha de suscripcién del
otrost No. 8), se implementé el procedimiento respectivo”.

(c) Mr. Balcero — who also had given a statement during the Preliminary
Investigation — explained that he had made a technical analysis of Prodeco’s
proposal; he had found that Prodeco’s proposal was justified by the need to expand
the Mine, and that this would ultimately benefit Colombia. Mr. Balcero stated that
he had run several economic models, upon the request of Ingeominas’ Consejo
Directivo. Mr. Balcero confirmed, as did Ms. Aristizébal and Ms. Gémez, that
Mr. Ballesteros and Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo had always been informed of
the negotiation process and that production costs had increased in the past 10 years.
Mr. Balcero also directed the Contraloria to the Viability Study. Finally,
Mr. Balcero declared that the Eighth Amendment had prompted Prodeco to make
significant investments in the Calenturitas Mine in 2010.98

(d) Ms. Melida Cabezas — who had been in charge of the legal aspects of the
negotiation with Prodeco — stated that in mid-2009 Ingeominas’ officials had found
that Prodeco’s proposal was not technically or legally viable. However,
Mr. Ballesteros had asked them to come up with a counter-proposal to offer
Prodeco. After conducting further studies, Ingeominas’ officials found that an
expansion of the Mine would benefit the Colombian State. Ms. Cabezas also

confirmed that Mr. Ballesteros and the Consejo Directivo had been fully informed
of the negotiations.*?

(e) Ms. Maria Diaz Lopez, Chief Legal Advisor to the Ministry of Mines and
Energy, declared that Ingeominas’ officers had kept the Consejo Directivo informed
of Prodeco’s requests for an amendment to the Mining Contract. Ms. Diaz Lépez
explained that the Ministro de Minas y Energia had given several recommendations
to Ingeominas and that the aim of the negotiation was to increase royalty payments
for the State and to expand the Mine.*°

E. The Contraloria Extends the Indictment and Attaches Assets

On 26 April 2012, the Contraloria ordered the production of further evidence in the
Fiscal Liability Proceeding, including, inter alia, all the documents and calculations
that had served as the basis for the Viability Study.*°!

As a result of this new evidence, on 11 July 2012, the Contraloria decided to extend
the indictment to additional civil servants. In addition to Mr. Ceballos and Prodeco,
previously indicted, the Contraloria indicted the former Ministro de Minas y
Energia, Mr. Ballesteros, and the four Ingeominas officers who had been involved
in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment, to wit:

- Mr. Hernan Martinez Torres, who was the Ministro de Minas y Energia at the

relevant time; the Contraloria considered that Mr. Martinez Torres’ action as
member of Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo had been passive or careless,
whereas it should have been active and decisive;*

- Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas’ Director General at the relevant time; the

Contraloria found that Mr. Ballesteros had failed to comply with the appropriate
controls and procedures, and to conduct the appropriate analysis;*°

- Ms. Aristizébal, Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero, and Ms. Gomez, as officers of

Ingeominas’ Subdirecci6n de Fiscalizacién y Ordenamiento Minero, involved
in the process of the Eighth Amendment; the Contraloria considered them
suspect because they had signed the Viability Study, although they had
previously declared that a modification of the Mining Contract was not
warranted.*

Preliminary Attachment

On 17 July 2012 the Contraloria decided, as precautionary measures, to attach
assets belonging to each of the civil servants indicted in the Fiscal Liability

F. New Technical Reports
On 24 August 2012, the Contraloria notified the Tovar Silva Report to Prodeco.*

On 5 September 2012, Prodeco challenged the Tovar Silva Report (infra, i) and
once again requested that the Contraloria close the Fiscal Liability Proceeding (ii).
This request was accompanied by an expert report by KPMG (iii).*”°

(i) In the challenge, Prodeco said that the Tovar Silva Report had made legal
considerations which were beyond its scope and had ignored all the documents
submitted by Prodeco to Ingeominas explaining the benefits of the Eighth
Amendment for the State. Furthermore, Prodeco took issue with the fact that the
Tovar Silva Report had limited its economic analysis to the Transition Period,
disregarding the long-term impact of the Eighth Amendment.*”!

(ii) Prodeco also argued that the Eighth Amendment had not caused any damage to
Colombia and that Prodeco had always acted in good faith. Prodeco explained that
the Eighth Amendment had to be examined as a whole, and that it would only be
possible to ascertain if the State had suffered damage once the Mining Contract had
expired. Prodeco also submitted that it could not be subject to the Fiscal Liability
Proceeding because it did not have any public fiscal responsibility.*””

(iii) The KPMG report analysed the economic and financial aspects underlying the
Eighth Amendment and the benefit it generated for the State’s finances. The report
found that an expansion of the Calenturitas Mine would not have been possible

It is worth mentioning that the Contraloria did not attach any assets of Mr. Ceballos (Doc. C-19).

Amendment had resulted in a much higher benefit for the State than for Prodeco.*”

Clarifications by Tovar Silva

As a consequence of Prodeco’s challenge to the Tovar Silva Report, on 29 October
2012, the Contraloria asked Ms. Tovar Silva to provide clarifications.>”*
Accordingly, on 9 November 2012, Ms. Tovar Silva explained that she had
examined the impact of the Eighth Amendment on the State’s finances only during
the Transition Period because this was the only period for which there was actual

Valenzuela/Riveira Report

On 14 November 2012, Messrs. Luis Valenzuela and Felipe Riveira, who had
respectively served as Minister and Vice-Minister of Mines and Energy,*”°
submitted an expert opinion, commissioned by Prodeco, analysing whether the
Eighth Amendment had benefitted Colombia.*”” The report came to the following
conclusions:378

- Under the original compensation scheme Prodeco would not have expanded
production, since this would have generated a reduction in its NPV;

- The benefits or disadvantages of the Eighth Amendment on the State’s finances
could only be established by examining the entire life of the Mining Contract,
not just its first year in isolation;

- Colombia would only see the benefits of the Eighth Amendment once Prodeco’s
programmed expansion actually took place — a process that required several
years; this meant that in 2010-2011 the Eighth Amendment would not yet be
generating higher yields for the State;

- The Eighth Amendment did not cause a damage to Colombia; on the contrary,
it would bring an additional USD 205 M in compensation payments.

83 Doc, C-141. In particular, the KPMG report found that: “La Nacién obtiene un incremento de sus
beneficios en casi tres veces el aumento de los beneficios que recibe Prodeco con la realizacién de la
expansién y el Otrosi 8. Con la ejecucién del Proyecto de Expansién y con la suscripcin del Otrosi 8, el
incremento el VPN de las regalias es de un 57% mayor al Proyecto de Produccién Anterior al Otrosi 8.
Sin embargo el aumento del VPN de la mina que tiene Prodeco es del 23%” (Doc. C-141, p. 11).

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Faced with contradictory information, on 10 April 2013, the Contraloria decided
to commission a technical support team to produce a report on the Eighth
Amendment:*”

“[...] para determinar si se desvirtiian los fundamentos del presente proceso
de responsabilidad y el daiio causado a la Naci6n por la disminuci6n en las
regalias y compensaciones a su favor”.

G. New Depositions

Between April and May 2013, the Contraloria heard the depositions of the new
defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Martinez Torres,
Ms. Aristazadbal, Ms. Cabezas, Ms. G6mez and Mr. Balcero (infra, a. to £,).380 Given
that these individuals were no longer witnesses, but indicted defendants in the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding, they were not required to swear to tell the truth lest they might
incriminate themselves — thus they presented what in Colombian practice is known
as a “version libre y esponténea”.**!

(a) Mr. Ballesteros declared that the officials of the Deputy Mining Direction had
performed a technical, legal and economic analysis of Prodeco’s proposals.
Mr. Ballesteros noted that the negotiation between Ingeominas and Prodeco had
been long, and Ingeominas had never accepted Prodeco’s proposals at face value.
Finally, Mr. Ballesteros insisted that the Eighth Amendment would generate higher
revenues for the State than the previous regime.**”

(b) Mr. Martinez Torres testified that he had always acted to make sure that the
State’s interests were protected. He argued that the Eighth Amendment was
beneficial to the State and that he understood that the analysis had been correctly
performed.**?

(c) Ms. Aristizabal asked that her previous sworn deposition be taken into account.
She noted that she was not competent to decide whether or not the Eighth
Amendment had to be signed, and that Ingeominas had chosen not to hire external
experts to conduct economic analysis. Ms. Aristizabal explained that Ingeominas’
officers had tried to be as diligent as possible, to avoid any future disputes regarding
the Eighth Amendment.***

(d) Ms. Cabezas confirmed that there had been numerous meetings with Prodeco,
with the participation of Mr. Ballesteros, who was adamant that the Eighth

Amendment should be executed. She deposed that she had felt pressured by
Mr. Ballesteros:3*>

“De acuerdo a las proyecciones presentadas por PRODECO se hacia [sic] el
estudio econémico y técnico de los mismos como la negociacién no avanzaba
por cuanto el andlisis que de los cuadros nosotros haciamos de las propuestas
presentadas por PRODECO al Dr. Mario no le gustaban porque iban en
contravia de su querer el cual era dar viabilidad a la suscripcién de la
modificacién del contrato 0044/89 Esta circunstancia generé que el Dr.
Mario Ballesteros nos exigiera la sustanciaci6n a Luz Marina, Luz Mireya a
Giovanni y a mi que teniamos que elaborarle un cuadro y un escrito en el que
se viera reflejada la mejor posibilidad presentada por PRODECO para que
se pudiera dar la viabilidad del otrost. Siguiendo estas instrucciones y la furia
del Dr. Ballesteros porque no haciamos el cuadro conforme a su querer se
elaboraron otros conforme a sus instrucciones porque el Dr. Mario estaba
muy interesado en presentarle dicho cuadro al Ministro Hernan Martinez y a
todo el Consejo Directivo en Pleno para que segtin él tomaran las decisiones
correspondientes”.

 

 

447. Ms. Cabezas also affirmed that the Viability Study had been prepared after the
execution of the Eighth Amendment:**°

“Igualmente quiero agregar que el denominado escrito viabilidad para la
suscripcion del otrosi nimero 8 no fue lo que originé la suscripcion del mismo
por cuanto y reitero el otrosi numero 8 ya habia sido suscrito lo que generé
realmente la suscripcion de este otrosi fue la determinacion por parte del Dr.
Mario Ballesteros Mejia y el Ministro Hernan Martinez y fueron ellos los que
no se [sic] con que [sic] intereses decidieron modificar el contrato 044/89”.

448. (e) Ms. Gomez described the analysis she had performed before the execution of
the Eighth Amendment:**”

“Bdsicamente lo que yo hice fue las estimaciones matemdticas de lo que
estaba cancelando PRODECO por concepto de regalias y cudnto pagaria si
aumentaba su volumen de produccion a diez millones de toneladas”.

449. Ms. Gomez did not mention any pressure exercised by Mr. Ballesteros.

450. She explained that Mr. Ceballos had asked her and other colleagues to prepare the
Viability Study after the Eighth Amendment had been signed. The report was meant
to serve as an “aide-mémoire” which described all the parameters which
Ingeominas had taken into account when deciding to execute the Eighth
Amendment.***

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

451. (f) Mr. Giovanny Balcero also confirmed that there had been a number of meetings
between Ingeominas and Prodeco. He recalled that Prodeco had offered to increase
the capacity of the mine to 14 MTA, but that the restriction which made such
expansion unviable was the compensation provided for in the Mining Contract. His
task consisted in preparing financial models of the production of the Mine.**°

452. Mr. Balcero also confirmed that the Viability Study had been prepared after the
execution of the Eighth Amendment, and was meant to be a sort of aide-mémoire,
compiling all the information reviewed and all the analyses performed by the
Deputy Mining Direction. Finally, Mr. Balcero stated that Mr. Ballesteros showed
an interest in the execution of the Eighth Amendment, that no external experts were
hired, and that he breached internal procedures by not consulting the Subdirectora
de Fiscalizacion, Ms. Gloria del Socorro Arias.*°°

H. The Technical Support Report

453. On 20 May 2013, the Contraloria’s technical support team delivered a report with
its findings [“Technical Support Report”]. The Report mainly commented on
KPMG?’s report of September 2012.°?!

454. As in the case of the Tovar Silva Report, the Technical Support Report focused
exclusively on the year 2010, and found that the Eighth Amendment had resulted
in a reduction of Royalties and GIC paid to the State in an amount of COP 52.21
billion (equivalent to USD 27.28 M):?°?

455. The Technical Support Report said that the KPMG report of September 2012 had
been based on projections, instead of taking into account the actual data available
after the execution of the Eighth Amendment for the years 2010 and 2011.°%

Finally, the Technical Support Report recommended that the calculation performed
for the Transition Period should be repeated for 2011 and 2012.°%*

Further Reports

In June 2013, Prodeco presented a challenge to the Technical Support Report,*”>

which was accompanied by a new expert report by KPMG.**°

And in July 2013, the technical support team issued yet another report, challenging
KPMG’s methodology of projecting future production scenarios and insisting that
any analysis of the damage suffered by the State should only take into account the
year 2010.79”

Prodeco’s Request for Closure of the Proceedings

On 28 August 2013, Prodeco once again requested that the Contraloria close the
Fiscal Liability Proceeding. Prodeco argued that the facts did not lead to the
conclusion that the State had suffered damage, or that Prodeco had acted deceitfully
or with gross negligence.*°*

I. The Contraloria Issues the Auto de Imputacién

Despite Prodeco’s submissions and requests, on 30 August 2013, the Contraloria
issued an Auto de imputacién de responsabilidad fiscal, (“Auto de Imputaci6n”|
formally charging Prodeco, Mr. Ceballos, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Martinez Torres,
and Ms. Aristizdbal. Prodeco, Mr. Ceballos and Mr. Ballesteros were accused of
acting with dolo, whereas Mr. Martinez Torres and Ms. Aristizabal were accused
of acting with culpa grave.*?

The Auto de Imputacion is a lengthy document, totalling more than 200 pages.
The Auto first analyses whether the State has suffered damages.*” Its general thrust
is that the Eighth Amendment has resulted in damage to the Colombian State, due

to a reduction in the Royalties to be paid by Prodeco.*”!

The Contraloria dismisses Prodeco’s argument that the fiscal analysis of the
Mining Contract could be made only upon its expiration in 2035:4°

“[...] en el ejercicio de sus funciones las contralorias tienen conferida la
atribucion de verificar la existencia cierta y actual de un dajio fiscal, con

ocasion de la ejecucion de un contrato, y de adelantar la accion dirigida a su
resarcimiento, sin esperar a su liquidacién, ni menos a la extincioén de las
acciones contencioso administrativas”.

463. As regards the quantum of the damage suffered by the State, the Auto de Imputacién
draws from the Tovar Silva Report and the Technical Support Report, and
concludes that the damage amounts to COP S51 billion, which is the reduction in
earnings suffered during the year 2011.4

464. The Contraloria also declares that although Prodeco was a private entity, it had
assumed responsibility towards the assets of the State when it executed the Mining
Contract, because it gave direction to the negotiations:4”

“Ast las cosas, es evidente que C.I. PRODECO particip6 activamente en el
resultado objeto de reproche fiscal, como quiera que la Firma, tal como lo
sefialé el auto de apertura orient6 la cuestionada modificaci6n y cada uno
[sic] de las propuestas 1 das a INGEOMINAS”. [Emphasis added;
spelling errors in the original]

465. The Contraloria also concludes that Prodeco has wilfully caused damage to the
State:4°°

“A lo largo de todo el material probatorio obrante en el proceso, se evidencia
una clara intenci6n por parte de Prodeco de modificar el contrato 044-89 a

biendas de gue con esta modificacién se irtan los ingresos para el
[sic] Nacién_Colombi: por _lo_cual_se_califica_su ducta_como
DOLOSA”. [Emphasis added and capitalisation in the original]

466. In the same Auto de Imputacion, the Contraloria decided to dismiss the indictment
and close the Fiscal Liability Proceeding with respect to Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero,
and Ms. Gomez, on the ground that their functions within Ingeominas did not
involve any decision-making powers.*°°

J. Prodeco’s Defence and Requests for Submission of New Evidence

defensa frente a las imputaciones efectuadas en el auto y solicitar y aportar
las pruebas que se pretendan hacer valer [...|”. [Emphasis added]

468. Accordingly, in October 2013, Prodeco and the remaining defendants in the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding submitted their arguments of defence against the Auto de
Imputacion.*°

469.

oS

Prodeco’s defence submitted that the Auto de Imputacién was groundless for
several reasons:

- Colombia had not suffered a certain and actual damage: Prodeco recognized that
the Contraloria could exercise a fiscal control at all times; however, it took issue
with the fact that the Contraloria had chosen to disregard the overall economy
of the Mining Contract and had based its analysis on the Transition Period.*?

- The evidence on the record did not lead to the conclusion that Prodeco had acted
with the intent of causing damage to the State’s financial interests; the
Contraloria seemed to mistake Prodeco’s legitimate intention of executing the
Eighth Amendment with an alleged intent of causing a damage to the State;*!°

- The Contraloria seemed to confuse Ingeominas’ irregular conduct with that of
Prodeco; the Contraloria failed to consider that Ingeominas was a specialized
State agency and that Prodeco could not have influenced its decision-making

process;4!!

- Prodeco could not be held fiscally liable because it was not responsible for the
management of public resources.*!*

470.

S

Prodeco also marshalled additional evidence: an expert report produced by
Inverlink*!? and a request that the Contraloria call several witnesses to testify.*!*

471.

In their defences, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Martinez Torres, and Ms. Aristizdbal also
asked to introduce more evidence in the record.*!5

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

On 14 January 2014, the Contraloria rejected most of Prodeco’s requests to submit

new evidence,*'® on the ground that the majority of the new evidence was either

superfluous or useless:*!”

- The Inverlink report did not bring a new perspective on the negotiations between
Ingeominas and Prodeco compared with the KPMG reports;

- Ms. Margarita Zuleta, as legal representative of Prodeco; had already given her
statement on the facts in question;

- Mr. Ballesteros was a defendant in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and as such
it would not be appropriate to have his testimony; in addition, he had already
given a statement;

- The testimonies of two of Prodeco’s employees who had participated in the
negotiation process were superfluous, because the events on which they would
testify were already covered in the record;

- The experts who had produced reports were not witnesses, but rather
independent experts, who had already submitted their views in the course of the
investigation.

The Contraloria decided to hear only Ms. Natalia Anaya, an officer of Prodeco who
had taken part in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment.*!®

It is worth noting that the Contraloria also accepted the request by Ms. Aristizabal
(an officer of Ingeominas who was among the defendants) to give a new
statement,*!? although she had already been heard three times before, whereas it
denied Prodeco’s request that Ms. Margarita Zuleta be heard again.

On 23 January 2014, Prodeco challenged the Contraloria’s decision. According to
Prodeco:*”°

- An in limine rejection of evidence could only take place when the evidence was
manifestly and flagrantly irrelevant, useless, or inopportune;

- All the evidence it had requested to submit was necessary to establish the
economic rationale behind the Eighth Amendment and the negotiation process,
which were at the heart of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding;

- If the Contraloria found itself “judge and party”, there was no guarantee of
impartiality;

- The Contraloria had disregarded Prodeco’s due process rights.

476. On 13 February 2014, the Contralora Delegada confirmed its initial decision and
denied Prodeco’s challenge.*?! Prodeco appealed the Contralora Delegada’s
decision. On 17 March 2014, the Contralora General confirmed the first instance
decision.‘

Further Appeals

477. On 6 May 2014, Prodeco presented a request for annulment of the Contraloria’s
decision that had barred Prodeco from producing additional evidence, and all
subsequent procedural decisions. According to Prodeco, the Proceedings had
violated Prodeco’s due process rights, in particular Prodeco’s right to defend
itself.473

478. This led Prodeco to file a constitutional injunction (accidn de tutela) with the
Tribunal Superior del Distrito Judicial de Bogotd.?* This court dismissed
Prodeco’s action, whereupon Prodeco lodged an appeal with the Corte Suprema de
Justicia. 75

479. On 22 October 2014, the Corte Suprema dismissed Prodeco’s request.*?° The Corte
Suprema noted that an accidén de tutela was not applicable to a Fiscal Liability
Proceeding, which had their own mechanisms for challenging a decision and were
subject to the jurisdiction of administrative courts.*”’ In addition, the Corte found
that the Contraloria had not acted arbitrarily and had properly justified its
decisions.*?8 The Corte Suprema concluded that:*”°

“[...] dentro del proceso de responsabilidad fiscal no se ha vulnerado el
derecho al debido proceso y a la defensa de la accionante; mdxime que la
actuacion atin se encuentra en curso y, como anteriormente se expreso, contra
la decisién administrativa que ponga fin al proceso, en caso de que le sea
desfavorable, tiene la posibilidad de impetrar la accién de nulidad y
restablecimiento del derecho”.

480. On 18 December 2014, the Colombian Corte Constitucional decided not to review
the decision of the Corte Suprema.*°

K. Ms. Aristizabal’s Third Statement

On 24 April 2014, the Contraloria heard Ms. Aristizabal’s new statement.**!
Ms. Aristizabal explained in more detail her mission in Ingeominas and her
participation in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment.

Departing from her three earlier statements, Ms. Aristizdbal declared that
Mr. Ballesteros had exercised undue pressure over her and that the other
Ingeominas officers who were working on the Eighth Amendment had violated the
applicable internal procedures. Ms. Aristizabal made clear that she was not
responsible for the execution of the Eighth Amendment:**?

“Con lo anterior quiero reiterar que frente a acuerdos e imposiciones,
previamente establecidas, primé la subordinaci6én y el temor al
desobedecimiento de unas 6rdenes que en forma directa venian siendo dadas
por el mismo Director General”.

L. Public Interview by the Contralora General

In December 2013, the Contralora General, Ms. Morelli Rico, gave an interview
to the newspaper Semana Sostenible. In that interview she stated her opinion that
Prodeco was not properly paying the royalties due under the Mining Contract, in an
amount of almost COP 50 billion, adding that there was “un principio de prueba”,
to be properly defined in the procedure. She also expressed surprise that Prodeco
was threatening a claim under the BIT.**?

M. The Procuraduria Closes the Investigation into Mr. Ceballos

In November 2013, the Procuraduria had initiated a disciplinary investigation
against Mr. Ceballos, the Ingeominas’ officer who had actually signed the Eighth
Amendment.

Six months thereafter, on 13 May 2014, the Procuraduria decided to close the file,
without finding any responsibility.

After reviewing the documentation surrounding the negotiation of the Eighth
Amendment, the Procuraduria found that the the Eighth Amendment was approved
by Ingeominas applying reasonable technical and financial criteria:**

“Al estudiar los antecedentes descritos y las explicaciones contenidas en los
distintos documentos aportados por la Agencia Nacional de Mineria, a
peticion de este despacho, es dable colegir que no existe conducta constitutiva

de_ falta _disciplinaria _atribuible a _JOSE__FERNANDO _CEBALLOS

N. The Contraloria’s Decision

On 30 April 2015, the Contralora Delegada, Ms. Vargas, issued the Contraloria’s
Decision, a 234-page-long fallo closing the Procedimiento de Responsabilidad
Fiscal. The main finding was that, by executing the Eighth Amendment,

- Prodeco,
- Mr. Ballesteros (the Director of Ingeominas),
- Mr. Martinez Torres (the Minister of Mining), and

- Mr. Ceballos (the Ingeominas officer who signed the Eighth Amendment, and
who had been acquitted in the disciplinary proceedings),

had incurred in fiscal liability. The fallo sentenced the convicted defendants to pay
to the State, jointly and severally, compensation for the damage caused which
amounted to COP 60 Bn.**°

The Contraloria’s Decision, however, absolved Ms. Aristizabal of liability, after
finding that there was no causal link between her conduct and the damage to the
State’s finances.**°

Summary

The Tribunal will highlight some aspects of the Contraloria’s Decision.*” In
general terms, the Decision accepted the same line of reasoning as the Auto de
Imputacion, and its principal thrust is to reinforce the arguments already announced
in the Auto.8

The Contraloria first found that, contrary to Prodeco’s argument, although the
Mining Contract is a long-term contract, the Contraloria was entitled to evaluate
its fiscal effects at any time, without having to wait for its termination.*?

The Contraloria’s main conclusion was that the Eighth Amendment did not
properly defend the interests of Colombia: the Amendment failed to formalize
Prodeco’s obligation to increase production of the Mine, and how and when such
increase would result in an increase in the compensation received by the State. In
accordance with Prodeco’s argumentation, the increase of production had been
formalized in the 2010 PTI-— but the Eighth Amendment lacks any reference to such
document. #4?

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Dolo

492. The Contraloria explained that Prodeco had wilfully permitted damage to the
State’s financial interests, in order to obtain greater benefits, thereby acting with
dolo.**' Although the Contraloria recognised that any private contractor had the
right to receive benefits from its economic activity, it found that it was improper for
a contractor to try to receive higher benefits to the detriment of the State’s
interests.“

493. The Contraloria found that Prodeco had put in place a series of manoeuvres to pay
a lower compensation to the State,“ in particular:

“El grado de culpabilidad que se le ha endilgado a PRODECO no se basa en
la intenci6n legitima de impedir o detener pérdidas, ni en la obtencién de
mayores ingresos, circunstancias que por st solas no constituyen
irregularidad alguna, como bien lo ha dicho el apoderado. Se fundamenta en
la serie de das por PRODECO que se materializan, en
cémo_rechazadas sus propuestas por INGEOMINAS, planteaba diferentes
escenarios, cémo [sic] pasé_entre_otros, de desequilibrio bmi

contractual, desacuerdo en la interpretaci6n de cldusulas contractuales, falta
de competitividad en el mercado aduciéndose entonces desigualdad con otras
empresas explotadoras de carbén en Colombia, hasta expansién, pero con
ésta disminuyendo el porcentaje de regalias a favor del Estado con el
argumento de que entre mayor produccién mayores ingresos a favor del
mismo. En_este_tiltimo_escenario_se_sostiene_que_tal_disminucién se

 

 

‘mds adelante, sin que se hubiese determinado de forma
y término para ello, salvo enunciados abstractos y genéricos”. [Emphasis

added]

494. The Contraloria also concluded that Prodeco’s conduct after receiving the Initial
Version of the Eighth Amendment was contrary to good faith:

“No obedece a los postulados de la buena fe, que después de suscrito el primer
otrosi No 8, que se devuelve sin registro minero, por lesivo a los intereses de
la Nacién, CI PRODECO, no asumiera un comportamiento acorde con la
realizacion y ejecuci6n del contrato suscrito, pasara por alto la advertencia
realizada y con ello desconociera el interés de la otra parte”. [Emphasis in
the original]
495. The Contraloria found that Prodeco was Ingeominas’ “collaborator”: 4°
“Pasa por alto el sefior apoderado que PRODECO tiene una relacién
contractual sui generis, producto del contrato estatal suscrito mediante el
cual se busca el cumplimiento de los fines del Estado, vinculo juridico en el

que esta involucrado el interés general, y por tal razon, adquirié la calidad o
condicion de ‘colaborador’ en el cumplimiento de tales fines”.

The Contraloria finally concluded that, although Ingeominas had failed to meet its
responsibilities, so also had Prodeco:7

“En el caso objeto de debate, Cl. PRODECO conoci6 y participé en los
hechos que dieron lugar a la lesion de los intereses patrimoniales del Estado.
No obstante, ahora pretende que las cargas s6lo reposaban en cabeza de la
administracién INGEOMINAS, cuando en realidad también formaban parte
de su carga y responsabilidad como colaborador de aquella”.“* [Emphasis
in the original]

Preliminary studies

In addition, the Contraloria found that Ingeominas did not prepare the preliminary
studies, which would have been required in any contract of gran mineria.
Ingeominas had also failed formally to appoint officials to the negotiation and to
seek the recommendation of the Contracting Committee. The Contraloria also
noted that the Viability Study had not been prepared prior to the execution of the
Eighth Amendment, and contained severe inconsistencies, and overall it failed to
secure the State’s interests.*°°

In sum, the Contraloria considered that, although Prodeco was a private person, by
executing the Mining Contract it had assumed responsibility for the exploitation of
a non-renewable public resource and had thus become subject to fiscal liability.*°!

Damage

The Contraloria’s subsequent conclusion was that during the Transition Period
(ie. during the year 2010), the Republic had suffered a reduction in the
compensation received from Prodeco, and that Prodeco was responsible therefor:*?

“La responsabilidad de CI. PRODECO deviene de la lesién a los intereses
patrimoniales del Estado Colombiano como consecuencia de la modificacién
al negocio y condiciones ya pactadas, conocidas y en ejecucién por el
inversionista PRODECO e INGEOMINAS respecto del contrato 044/89, las
que fueron lesivas en el periodo de transicién a los intereses de la Nacién,
por lo que como bien se evidencia, lo que se busca es la reparaci6n al Estado
con una indemnizacion equivalente al valor que debia haberse pagado por
parte del inversionista al Estado Colombiano, por la explotacién del suelo y
subsuelo en el periodo de transicion, bajo las condiciones del contrato que no

habian cambiado en dicho periodo, que conocia y habia aceptado el
inversionista con la suscripcién del mismo”. [Emphasis added]

The relevant period for the calculation of the damage was exclusively the periodo
de transicion. The Decision justified this conclusion exclusively by reference to the
Tovar Silva Report:**

“Con el otrosi No. 8, se establecieron modificaciones en relacién con la
liquidacién de regalias y otras contraprestaciones econémicas, tal como se
recoge en el informe técnico del grupo de reacci6n inmediata, rendido por la
doctora Johanna Tovar Silva, el cual obra en el expediente y que claramente
determina las condiciones econémicas que fueron modificadas con ocasién
del otrosi No. 8 y su periodo de transicion.

Por lo tanto, para la presente causa fiscal, el daiio ocasionado y cuantificado
es el previsto para el denominado periodo de transicion, el cual se estipulé en
el otrosi No. 8, tal y como lo precisan los informes técnicos obrantes como
pruebas dentro del proceso, y lo sefialé en su oportunidad el auto de
imputacion, las distintas modificaciones introducidas al contrato advierten
una disminucién y menoscabo en la [sic] regalias y contraprestaciones
econémicas, como en efecto ocurrié para dicho periodo [...]”.

The Contraloria’s Decision calculated such damage as the difference between the
income which the Republic had received under the Eighth Amendment during the
Transition Period (i.e. during the year 2010) and the income which it would have
received had the Eighth Amendment not been executed.*** For the precise

calculations, the Contraloria’s Decision referred to:*°>

- The Tovar Silva Report, which estimated a damage of COP 51.4 billion, and

- The Technical Support Report, which reached a slightly higher amount of COP
§2.2 billion.

The Decision explained that the difference between both reports was due to
differences in the Tasa Representativa del Mercado [“TRM”], without providing
further detail,**° and eventually settled for the higher amount:*°”

“Para este despacho, las conclusiones del informe son contundentes en
sefialar que como consecuencia de los cambios realizados en el cdlculo de los
items de regalia bdsica, regalia adicional y compensacién por ingresos
brutos, para la produccién del aiio 2010 (aitio considerado de transicién), en
la Mina Calenturitas de acuerdo con el Otrosi 8, el Estado dej6 de percibir la
suma de $52.214.393.982,17”.

This amount was then indexed in accordance with the Colombian inflation rate
between December 2010 and January 2015, reaching a total of
COP 60,023,730,368.33.

Causal link

The Contraloria also held that Prodeco’s conduct had been decisive for the
execution of the Eighth Amendment, and consequently that there was a causal link
between Prodeco’s dolo and the damage suffered by the State.*°*

Dispositif

The dispositif ordered Prodeco and Messrs. Ceballos, Martinez Torres and
Ballesteros, jointly and severally (“solidariamente’’) to pay to the Colombian State
the amount of COP 60 Bn. Ms. Aristizdbal was acquitted of liability.+°°

Finally, the Contraloria decided to send a copy of the Decision to the State’s mining
agency, for the effects of Art. 61 of Law 610 of 2000,‘ which provides for:**!

“CADUCIDAD DEL CONTRATO ESTATAL. Cuando en un proceso de
responsabilidad fiscal un contratista sea declarado responsable, las
contralorias solicitardn a la autoridad administrativa correspondiente que
declare la caducidad del contrato, siempre que no haya expirado el plazo para
su ejecucion y no se encuentre liquidado”.

O. Prodeco’s Appeals en Via Gubernativa

Immediately after the enactment of the Contraloria’s Decision, Prodeco started a
long list of requests and appeals to have such Decision overturned.

On 11 May 2015, Prodeco filed:

- A recurso de reposicién asking for reconsideration of the Contraloria’s
Decision, with the Contralora Delegada, the very authority who had issued the
Decision, and

- A recurso de apelacién with the Contralor General de la Repiiblica, the
supervisor of the Contralora Delegada.*”

458 Doc, C-32, p. 109.

These administrative appeals were unsuccessful.
Reconsideration Decision

In July 2015, the Contralora Delegada rejected Prodeco’s recurso de reposicién.
In her Reconsideration Decision, the Contraloria dismissed Prodeco’s reasoning.*°

Appeal Decision

On 21 August 2015, the Contralor General de la Republica issued the Appeal
Decision in the recurso de apelacién, confirming the Contraloria’s Decision
[Appeal Decision”].*~

In his Decision, the Contralor General explained the background to the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding and summarized the Contraloria’s Decision.*° After
reviewing the facts in the file, the Contralor General fully supported the
conclusions of the Contralora Delegada and dismissed the appeal.*©°

As to Prodeco’s reasons to lodge an appeal, the Contralor General noted the
following:

(i) The Contraloria is authorized to exercise its control function over contracts once
the contract has been signed, there being no requirement that the contract be
finalized and liquidated.*©”

(ii) The lack of planning and of preliminary studies by Ingeominas could be directly
imputed to Prodeco. Prodeco, by signing a contract with the public administration,
became its collaborator and entered into a special relationship.*°*

Prodeco failed to adhere to this heightened level of responsibility. It imposed its
desire to obtain profits over the collective interests of the society, and it took
advantage of the institutional frailty of Ingeominas:*”

(iii) The characterization of Prodeco’s conduct as dolosa in the Contraloria’s
Decision was accurate.*”° There are two fundamental reasons why Prodecto acted
with dolo:

- Its actions showed “una intencidn de incrementar ilegitimamente sus ganancias
derivadas del negocio, sin hacer un minimo esfuerzo por armonizarlos [sic] con

los intereses estatales, obligacion que se deriva de su condicién de colaborador
de la administraci6n”;

- Additionally, dolo derives from the fact that Prodeco resorted to the argument

that it would increase its investments and the volume of coal mined, but such
increases did not materialize during the Transition Period (i.e. during the year
2010).47!

(iv) The Appeal Decision also confirmed that Prodeco can be subjected to a fiscal
control procedure and that there had been no violation of due process.*””

The Contralor General also rejected the remaining appeals by Mr. Martinez Torres,
Mr. Ballesteros, and Mr. Ceballos.47>

 

P. Judicial Recourse: The Annulment Procedure

Having exhausted the available administrative remedies (recursos en via
gubernativa), Prodeco put in motion a judicial proceso de nulidad before the
Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca [“Annulment Procedure”). This was
the first time that the dispute between Prodeco and the Contraloria was submitted
to a Court of Justice — till then, the Fiscal Liability Proceeding had been handled
and decided by the Contraloria, a non-judicial agency of the Colombian Republic.

After a mandatory, but eventually unsuccessful conciliation attempt, on 31 March
2016, Prodeco filed the Annulment Procedure with the Tribunal Administrativo de
Cundinamarca.*"* The remedies sought were:*”°

- Annulment of the Contraloria’s Decision,

- With the consequent restitution of the amounts already paid by Prodeco in

compliance with the Contraloria’s Decision,

- Certain ancillary requests plus damages.

Progre:
The progress of this court procedure has been slow.

The Tribunal Administrativo adopted its first measure on 31 January 2017, when it
dismissed the claim on formal grounds. Two months later, on 17 March 2017,

Prodeco filed a submission correcting the errors. This submission was presented to
the Judge (“al despacho”) on 28 March 2017.4”

The evidence submitted by the Parties on the record shows the development of the
Annulment Procedure only until June 2017.47’ The Parties have however confirmed
that the Tribunal has not yet issued a decision on Prodeco’s claim.*”

Q. Payment by Prodeco

On 19 January 2016, in order to avoid the forfeiture of the Mining Contract, Prodeco
paid to the Colombian State the Fiscal Liability Amount of COP 63 Bn (USD
19.1M), which Prodeco had been ordered to pay as a result of the Fiscal Liability
Proceeding [the “Fiscal Liability Amount”). Prodeco did so under protest.4”?

Prodeco also asked that the Contraloria lift the attachment of Prodeco’s assets,
which had been ordered in 2012.48°

FILING OF THE PROCEDURE FOR CONTRACTUAL ANNULMENT

Pursuant to clause 39, the Mining Contract is subject to Colombian law and to the
jurisdiction of Colombian courts.**! Colombian courts are thus empowered to
adjudicate all disputes arising out of the Mining Contract — including any dispute
as regards the validity of the Contract or of its Amendments.

On 30 March 2012, the SGC (the mining agency), invoking clause 39 of the Mining
Contract, and after an unsuccessful request for mandatory conciliation, filed the
Procedure for Contractual Annulment with the Tribunal Administrativo de
Cundinamarca [previously defined as the “Procedure for Contractual
Annulment”). The SGC requested that the court declare the nullity of the Eighth
Amendment, arguing that such Amendment was detrimental to the general interest
of the State: the Amendment had been executed on the assumption that it would
generate benefits for the State, but this scenario had not materialized.**?

Subsidiarily, the SGC requested that the Tribunal Administrativo revise the Eighth
Amendment, “de tal manera que se preserve el interés general, recuperando y
manteniendo a un futuro el equilibrio de la ecuaci6n financiera del Contrato
044/89, perdido con el desarrollo del Otrosi No. 8”.

530. The SGC’s claim was served on Prodeco in October 2012.483

531. On 15 May 2013, the ANM (which had replaced the SGC) resubmitted its claim
before the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,*** in terms which were
practically identical to the initial ones. The ANM however updated the amount of
the State’s alleged losses resulting to USD 99 M.4*>

532. On 7 October 2013, Prodeco filed its response to the ANM’s resubmitted claim,**°
together with a report by KPMG.*87

533. Prodeco said that the Eighth Amendment had been executed in accordance with
Colombia’s legislation and had been necessary to permit an expansion of the Mine.
Prodeco also argued that the Eighth Amendment would increase Colombia’s
benefits in the long-term. According to Prodeco, the impact of the Eighth
Amendment’s on the State’s finances could only be determined at the end of the
life of the Mining Contract.***

534. On 22 October 2013, the ANM filed its reply submission.**°

535. It is undisputed that the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca has not issued a
decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment.*”°

(9) AMICABLE CONSULTATIONS AND ARBITRATION

536. On 28 August 2015, Claimants wrote to the President of Colombia Mr. Juan Manuel
Santos, formally notifying a dispute under the Treaty.*?! Claimants referred to their
letter of September 2013, in which they had explained their investments in
Colombia and expressed their concern regarding the State’s actions, which
Claimants considered to be in violation of the Treaty. Claimants thus put in motion

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

On 4 March 2016, following the expiration of such period, Claimants submitted a
Request for Arbitration with ICSID,*** which gave rise to the present arbitration.

CRIMINAL COMPLAINT AGAINST PRODECO

On Sunday, 10 September 2017, the Director de la Agencia Nacional de Defensa
Juridica del Estado [previously defined as “ANDJE”] filed with the Fiscalia
General de la Nacién a “Denuncia penal en averiguacion de responsables por la
presunta comisién de delitos contra la administracion publica” against Prodeco and
Glencore [previously defined as the “Criminal Complaint].

The copy of the Criminal Complaint submitted in this procedure is partially
redacted, and hence relevant aspects of such denuncia remain unknown to this
Tribunal. In the unredacted part, the ANDJE provides the factual background to the
3ha Contract (see section II.(3) supra), gives a summary of the facts surrounding
the negotiation and execution of the Eighth Amendment, and submits a list of
articles of the Colombian Criminal Code which might have been violated.

The Criminal Complaint does not accuse any individual persons of having
committed specific illegal conduct, but simply asks the Fiscalia to investigate and
to determine wheter crimes have been commited.”

There is no evidence in the file of any investigation carried out by the Fiscalia as a
consequence of the Criminal Complaint.

Disciplinary complaint against employees and ex-employees of the mining agency

Only two days after the Criminal Complaint, the ANDJE submitted a new
complaint, in this case a disciplinary complaint, with the Procurador General de la
Nacion against several ex-employees of Ingeominas and the Ministry of Mines,
inter alia Mr. Martinez Torres, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Ceballos, and Mr. Maldonado,
for alleged violations of the Cédigo Unico Disciplinario.*”°

According to the ANDJE’s complaint, the concerned individuals had engaged in
irregular courses of conduct between 2006 and 2010, in order to permit the
execution of the Eighth Amendment. The ANDJE attached to its disciplinary
complaint the Criminal Complaint filed with the Fiscalia.

There is no evidence in the file of any investigation carried out by the Procuraduria
as a consequence of this disciplinary complaint.

IV. RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES

546. In the present section the Arbitral Tribunal reproduces the Parties’ requests for
relief.

(1) CLAIMANTS’ REQUEST FOR RELIEF

547. In their Post-Hearing Brief,*** Claimants declared that they reiterated the requests

for relief submitted in their Reply memorial, which reads as follows:*”

“374. On the basis of the foregoing, Claimants respectfully request that the
Tribunal:

(a) DECLARE that Colombia has breached Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 10(2) of
the Treaty;

(b) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM or any other government agency
that may in due course become the contractual counterparty of Prodeco under
the Mining Contract, continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment
and further that all organs of the Colombian State take any and all actions
necessary to ensure and not interfere with such continued performance and
observance;

(c) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, procure the immediate and
unconditional cessation of the ANM Proceedings with prejudice;

(d) ORDER that Colombia provide appropriate assurances and guarantees
from the GCO*™ that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in
relation to the Eighth Amendment;

(e) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, give appropriate assurances
and guarantees that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in
relation to the Eighth Amendment;

(f) ORDER that, by way of restitution, Colombia repay to Prodeco the Fiscal
Liability Amount of US$19.1 million*”! paid by Prodeco to Colombia on 19
January 2016 in the context of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, and any sums
that the GCO or any other organ of the Colombian State or Colombian court
may, up to the date of the Tribunal’s Award, have ordered Prodeco to pay by
way of royalties or GIC calculated on the purported basis that the Eighth
Amendment should not apply, adjusted from the date of payment to the date
of the Award at an annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually;

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

(g) ORDER that if Colombia does not comply with orders requested in (b),
(c), (d), (e), and (f) above within 90 days of the date of the Award, Colombia:

(A) pay Claimants the Fiscal Liability Amount of US$19.1 million plus
interest to the date of the Award;

(B) pay Claimants forward-looking damages as of the date of the Award
computed as the difference in expected net revenues between a

million as of 31 December 2017; and

(Cc

fully indemnify and hold harmless Claimants in respect of all
retroactive royalty and GIC amounts that Claimants are ordered to pay
in relation to the years 2011 to the date of the Award as a consequence
of a failure to apply the Eighth Amendment, assessed at US$238.6
million as of 31 December 2017.

V. JURISDICTIONAL AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS

550. Claimants argue that their investments in Colombia are protected pursuant to Arts.
1(1) and 1(2)(c) of the Treaty*” and that all requirements for access to arbitration
both under the ICSID Convention and under the Treaty have been satisfied.°°°

551. Respondent, however, argues that Claimants’ claims are not admissible and fall
outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.*°”
Respondent raises three jurisdictional and one admissibility objections:°°*

- The Tribunal may not exercise competence over Claimants’ claims because the

Eighth Amendment is tainted with illegality, as it was procured through illicit
means and bad faith conduct [“Ilegality Objection”] (V.1);

- Claimants’ claim against the conduct of the Contraloria falls outside the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal by virtue of the fork-in-the-road provision of the
Treaty, because Claimants resorted to Colombian administrative courts to
adjudicate that claim before starting the present arbitration [“Fork-in-the-Road
Objection”) (V.2);

- The Tribunal cannot derive competence from the umbrella clause of the Treaty,
because the dispute-resolution clause of the Treaty expressly excludes disputes
based on such clause; additionally, the Tribunal also lacks competence over
claims against the ANM, since these claims are contractual and the Mining
Contract contains its own dispute-resolution clause [“Umbrella Clause
Objection”) (V.3);

- Claimants’ claims are not ripe for adjudication and are, therefore, inadmissible
[“Inadmissibility Objection” (V.4).

552. Claimants note that Respondent does not dispute that Claimants and their
investments are protected under the Treaty, or that Claimants have fulfilled all
requirements to have access to arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the
Treaty.°° As to Colombia’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections, Claimants
consider that they do not withstand scrutiny.>!°

V.1. ILLEGALITY OBJECTION

Colombia argues that Claimants’ claims are tainted by illegality, because Claimants
engaged in acts of corruption and bad-faith conduct. Respondent submits that
Claimants’ illicit conduct deprives Claimants’ investments of the protection of the
Treaty and that the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence over such
claims (1)).°!!

Claimants counter that Respondent’s illegality allegations are devoid of any support
or substance.*!? Claimants argue that Respondent has failed to satisfy the standard
of proof required for corruption allegations, and that Respondent’s characterization
of Prodeco’s actions cannot deprive the Centre of its jurisdiction and the Tribunal
of its competence (2).>!

The Tribunal will devote separate sections to the allegation of corruption (3) and of
bad faith (4), and will finally summarize its decisions (5).

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Respondent says that Claimants’ investment made in connection with the Eighth
Amendment cannot be protected by the Treaty, because such investment was
secured in contravention of Colombian law, and is tainted by Claimants’ illegal and
disloyal behaviour, including corruption and bad-faith conduct.>!+

According to Respondent, Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty expressly exclude from
protection investments made in violation of the laws and regulations of the recipient
State.*'> Respondent argues that if an investment was made on an illicit basis,
contrary to principles of good faith, or by way of corruption, fraud or deceitful
conduct, it cannot benefit from the substantive protection of the Treaty.>!®

Respondent explains that it is part of the general consensus in international
investment law that:

- Tribunals cannot exercise jurisdiction over illegal, illicit or improperly acquired
investments,>!? and

- The purpose of the international mechanism of protection of investments
through ICSID arbitration is not to defend investments which are illegal or
secured through improper means, but only bona fide investments.°'®

559. Respondent submits that if the Tribunal were to exercise jurisdiction over claims
based on illegal or illicit conduct, it would be condoning and encouraging such
misconduct.>!?

560. Respondent considers that Claimants’ conduct in securing the Eighth Amendment
falls within the type of illegal and improper behaviour which cannot be protected
by the ICSID arbitration system, for two main reasons:*”° in order to secure the
execution of the Eighth Amendment, Claimants engaged in illicit acts (A) and in
bad faith conduct (B).

A. Claimants Obtained the Eighth Amendment Through Illicit Means

561. Colombia submits that Claimants caused Ingeominas to execute the Eighth
Amendment through corruption: Claimants acquired the 3ha Contract from
Mr. Maldonado, thereby securing Director Ballesteros’ support for the
Commitment to Negotiate. According to Respondent, Claimants cannot deny that
they made an outsized payment to an associate of Director Ballesteros.>*!

562. Respondent argues that the Tribunal should follow the approach set out by the
Metal-Tech, Spentex, and World Duty Free tribunals for evaluating evidence of
corruption.*2?

563. According to Respondent, the Tribunal has a duty to inquire about the reasons for
the payment of a substantial sum made by Claimants to Mr. Maldonado, an
associate of Director Ballesteros. In this endeavour, the Tribunal should depart from
traditional rules on the burden of proof, and rather assess the evidence as whole,
given that it is almost impossible to prove bribery and corruption. The Tribunal
should “connect the dots” and identify “red flags” of corruption, in particular the
following:**

-  Prodeco paid a very high compensation of USD 1.75 M for the 3ha Contract;

- The price increased exponentially between December 2008 and April 2009 and
was disproportionate to the consideration received, which was a small plot of
land;

- Prodeco hid the documentation underlying the 3ha Contract; Prodeco did not
disclose the price of the transaction to Ingeominas until two years thereafter, in

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

the wake of the corruption scandal at Ingeominas; in addition, Prodeco has
produced almost no evidence concerning the 3ha Contract in this arbitration;

- Prodeco failed to produce evidence of the account to which the payment for the
3ha Contract was made;

- Finally, the payment was made directly to a former employee of Ingeominas’
predecessor, Mr. Maldonado, and as such, closely connected to the Director of
that State agency; only ten days after CDJ’s acquisition of the 3ha Contract was
approved, Director Ballesteros caused Ingeominas to execute the Commitment
to Negotiate.

564. Colombia contends that as a result of this undue influence, Claimants induced
Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment in complete disregard of the legal
framework applicable to the amendment of mining contracts. Claimants caused
Ingeominas to bypass the necessary authorizations and to breach the procedure for
the renegotiation of the Mining Contract.** In particular:*>>

- The Consejo Directivo of Ingeominas was not kept properly informed of the
negotiations;

- The advice of Ingeominas’ Contracting Committee and external consultants was
not sought, nor were the required ministerial approvals;

- No viability assessments were carried out prior to the execution of the Eighth
Amendment;

- The final version of the Eighth Amendment was negotiated over the span of five
days only, in an informal context.

565. Colombia argues that the above leads to the conclusion that the Eighth Amendment
was procured through illicit acts and in contravention of Colombian law; hence,
Claimants’ investment is tainted with illegality and cannot benefit from the
protection of the Treaty.*?°

Hearing

566. In the course of the Hearing, Colombia reiterated its position that an illegal
investment does not deserve legal protection, since the investor does not have
“clean hands”:527

- First, because Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty restrict the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to investments “made in accordance with [the Contracting Party’s] laws

and regulations”, and under Colombian law, corruption is illegal under Art. 411
A of the Criminal Code;

- Second, Respondent says that the evidence in the present case meets the standard
of proof for an illegality objection, and this follows from the application of the
red-flag methodology as used by the tribunals in Metal-Tech and Spentex;>**

- Third, tribunals confronted with illegality objections and corruption allegations
have a duty to take affirmative action and inquire as to the true reasons behind
suspicious payments;>”?

- Fourth, if explanations are not provided by the party who made the suspicious
payment, then tribunals must draw the only logical adverse inference, namely
that the payments have been made with the purpose of corrupting public
officials;

- Fifth, tribunals must not ignore red flags on the issue of corruption, and when
these red flags appear, a tribunal must connect the dots and conclude that the
investment was tainted with corruption;>*°

- Sixth, tribunals should not apply strictly the actori incumbit probatio rule, or a
heightened standard of proof, but instead they must look to the entirety of the
evidence in the record — otherwise they run the risk of making it almost
impossible to prove bribery.>*!

567.

x

Respondent also reiterated the red flags which — in its submission — prove
corruption:>7

- The payment,

- The fact that Mr. Maldonado was a former employee of Minercol (the
Republic’s prior mining agency),

- The timing of such payment,
- Claimants’ concealment of the transaction,

- Claimants’ decision to restrict knowledge of the transaction to three members of
its top management,

- The fact that the Eighth Amendment was executed in open disregard of the
applicable law and regulations.

B. Claimants Acted in Bad Faith

According to Colombia, Claimants provided false and misleading information to

Ingeominas, while withholding other important information, so as to induce

Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment. Colombia finds that this bad-faith

conduct in securing the Eighth Amendment is sufficient to deprive the investment

of the protections of the Treaty.** In particular:***

- Claimants misrepresented the economic situation of the project, in order to
persuade Ingeominas that expanding production beyond 8 MTA, under the
current conditions, was not economically feasible;

- Claimants presented misleading figures, aimed at showing the alleged lack of
profitability of the project’s expansion under the existing Compensation
Scheme;

- Claimants deliberately withheld geological, technical and accurate pricing
information from Ingeominas;

- Claimants improperly sought to justify delaying the submission of the 2010 PTI;

- Claimants sought to exert undue influence over Ingeominas through
questionable means.

Respondent rejects Claimants’ argument that Colombia would be estopped from
raising an illegality objection in the present case, given that the execution of the
Eighth Amendment would be attributable to Colombia. Respondent argues that the
responsibility for the misconduct surrounding the negotiations of the Eighth
Amendment cannot be placed solely on Ingeominas. Through corruption and bad
faith, Claimants willingly caused and shaped the negotiations that led to the
execution of the Eighth Amendment.>*>

aK

In sum, Respondent submits that, in securing the Eighth Amendment, Claimants
did not act in good faith, but rather acted deceitfully and illegally. The Eighth
Amendment was procured through acts of corruption, which is prohibited under
both international and Colombian law. This means that Claimants’ claims are
tainted with illegality and fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.*°°

Respondent says that, alternatively, if the Tribunal were to consider that Claimants’
conduct is not an obstacle to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, it should conclude that
Claimants’ unclean hands render their claims inadmissible.°*”

CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

Claimants contend that Respondent’s allegations of illegality (A) and bad faith (B)
have no merit and cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.

A. Colombia’s Allegations of Iegality are Devoid of Substance

Claimants argue that Colombia’s corruption allegations are false and
unsubstantiated. According to Claimants, as recognised by the Metal-Tech, Spentex,
and ECE tribunals, the party who raises corruption allegations has the burden of
proof.>*

Case-law confirms that when confronted with such allegations, tribunals are bound
to consider them, but also to safeguard those against whom corruption is alleged.
As explained by the Spentex tribunal, shifting the burden of proof and demanding
evidence from the accused party that it did not engage in corrupt acts would subject
such party to a probatio diabolica. Hence, it is not for Claimants to prove their
innocence, but for Colombia to prove its claims.

According to Claimants, in the present case, Colombia has failed to produce any
evidence supporting its allegation that the Eighth Amendment was procured
through corruption.>*°

Claimants submit that, far from engaging in corrupt practices in order to influence
civil servants to negotiate a contractual amendment, Claimants were the victims of
an extortion scheme, facilitated by the Colombian government’s inertia in the face
of Claimants’ multiple challenges, complaints and requests for investigation.
Claimants argue that:*#!

- Prodeco filed multiple administrative petitions and appeals to prevent the 3ha

Contract from being granted to Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia; after it had been
granted, and even after it was assigned to CDJ, Prodeco still complained to the
highest Colombian authorities and requested investigations;

- Faced with the silence of the Colombian authorities, CDJ agreed to the

assignment of the 3ha Contract; the price paid by CDJ for this assignment was
not disproportionately high, given the value of the coal within the three-hectare
area, and the significant losses that would have resulted for the Prodeco
Affiliates from the inability to mine around that area; in addition, Messrs.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Maldonado and Garcia had initially requested that CDJ pay approximately
USD 10 million for the assignment;

- Claimants have not concealed the documentation underpinning the 3ha Contract;

the vast majority of the evidence relating to this transaction was placed on the
record by Claimants; in addition, Claimants have presented Mr. Nagle as a
witness, whereas Colombia has not presented a single witness who was involved
in the events allegedly involving corruption; Colombia also deliberately ignores
information that it has in its possession, such as the repeated complaints filed by
the Prodeco Affiliates or the volume of coal extracted by CDJ from the 3 hectare
concession;

- Claimants did not keep the price paid for the 3ha Contract secret; there was no

obligation to disclose the purchase price to Ingeominas before the transaction;
in any event, CDJ disclosed the purchase price to Ingeominas nine months after
the transaction, it reflected the purchase price in its accounts and audited
financial statements, and made the necessary Colombian tax withholdings;
finally, Claimants paid the purchase price to the bank accounts identified in the
assignment contract;

- Colombia has not established any connection whatsoever between

Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Ballesteros; moreover, Mr. Maldonado was an
employee of Carbocol, Ecocarb6n and Minercol between 1988 and 2002,
whereas Mr. Ballesteros only began his tenure at Ingeominas in 2007.

As for Colombia’s allegation that through corruption Claimants induced
Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment, Claimants reject it, and argue that
there were no departures from internal Government procedures:**

- Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo did not have to approve contractual amendments

such as the Eighth Amendment;

- Ingeominas had discretion to decide whether to appoint an external advisor or to

consult the Contracting Committee;

- Ingeominas was not required to prepare a viability report;

- The Ministro de Minas y Energia did not have to approve the Eighth

Amendment prior to execution;

Claimants submit that even if true, these alleged departures could not deprive the
Tribunal of jurisdiction because they were not known to or not attributable to
Claimants and were not significant.** Colombia is bound by the actions of its
officers under international law and is, thus, estopped from objecting to the

CIL, paras. 163(c) and 168-171; C III, para. 43.

Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that those officers did not comply with their own
obligations.*“4

Claimants submit that Colombia has also failed to explain how Mr. Ballesteros
would have allegedly single-handedly forced employees or board members of
Ingeominas, or even the Ministro de Minas y Energia, to engage in purported
irregularities in the negotiation and execution of the Eighth Amendment.

In addition, the new administration of Ingeominas, led by Mr. Paredes, never raised
these procedural irregularities when it sought to annul the Eighth Amendment, or
investigated the concerned parties for administrative or disciplinary purposes.*>

Thus, Claimants argue that Colombia’s illegality objection must be dismissed in its
entirety.>4°

Hearing

At the Hearing, Claimants reiterated that Respondent’s allegations of corruption
were advanced for the first time in this arbitration, without a shred of evidence.°47

Claimants explained that following Glencore’s acquisition of the Prodeco
Affiliates, these companies submitted to Ingeominas an agreement for the
integrated use of mining infrastructure, to conduct joint operations in the La Jagua
mine. Ingeominas authorized this integrated mining operation in April 2007. It was
in this context that Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garcia applied for a concession over
the 3 hectare area situated in the middle of the La Jagua project, likely exploiting
insider knowledge. Despite CDJ’s administrative challenges, Ingeominas reversed
its initial decision, and resolved to give the 3 hectare concession to Messrs.
Maldonado and Garcia**.

Claimants submit that, thereafter, Prodeco complained to the highest Colombian
state authorities; despite this, not a single authority took any action against what
was apparently highly inappropriate conduct.**? Even after Prodeco purchased the
3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia, the company continued to
complain to the highest authorities. Nevertheless, no authority with investigative
power did anything.>*°°

According to Claimants, Respondent’s corruption allegation only stands through a
highly selective and deliberately misleading narrative of the facts.**! Claimants
refer to the Methanex decision, in which the tribunal found that in order properly to

connect the dots and make inferences, each and every relevant dot must be

considered individually before trying to assert a pattern.** Claimants argue that

Respondent’s alleged “red flags” are totally without merit:>°

- The amount paid by Claimants for the 3ha Contract was not strikingly high or
disproportionate, since the Prodeco Affiliates stood to lose tens of millions of
dollars if they could not gain access to the 3 hectare area;

- Claimants have not concealed any documents related to the 3ha Contract; in fact,
Claimants have brought extensive correspondence to the record; by contrast,
Respondent did not tell this Tribunal that the Prodeco Affiliates had filed
multiple complaints relating to the 3ha Contract with the State’s highest
authorities;

- Claimants did not conceal the price paid for the 3ha Contract from the
Colombian authorities; there was no obligation to disclose the price paid for the
3 hectare concession to Ingeominas, and in any event CDJ did so as part of its
regular disclosures of domestic suppliers of goods and services; in addition,
Claimants made the appropriate tax withholdings and the price was reflected in
CDJ’s audited financial statements; finally, the Assignment Contract clearly
identifies the price paid for the 3 hectare concession;

- Respondent has not established any connection between Mr. Maldonado and Mr.
Ballesteros; Mr. Maldonado worked in Ecorcarb6n and Minercol in Valledupar
between 1998 and 2002; Mr. Ballesteros started his tenure at Ingeominas in
Bogota in 2007;

- There was no departure from internal Government procedures.

B. Claimants Did Not Act in Bad Faith

586.

a

Claimants submit that they did not misrepresent or conceal any information from
Ingeominas. Even if Colombia’s mischaracterization of Claimants’ conduct were
correct, there would still be no ground for a jurisdictional objection.**+

587.

x

Claimants argue that the standard for proving bad faith is a demanding one; only
significant and intended violations of applicable laws by investors can serve as
grounds for challenging jurisdiction. Colombia has failed to prove any violations or
conduct grave enough to give rise to a jurisdictional objection.**

- Diligently responded to all of Ingeominas’ requests for information;

- Repeatedly invited Ingeominas to request any additional information that might
facilitate its review of Prodeco’s proposals;

- Solicited questions from Ingeominas;

- Facilitated in-depth, in-person reviews of the proposals with Ingeominas’
negotiation team.

Claimants also deny Colombia’s accusations that they presented skewed
information to Ingeominas, or that they omitted to present any material information
to Ingeominas in bad faith.*°” Claimants argue that Colombia and its experts try to
scavenge for purported errors in the estimates and analyses shared by Prodeco with
Ingeominas at the relevant time. Their argument, however, is based on information
that Ingeominas never requested. As held by the Mamidoil Jetoil tribunal, States
cannot abuse the process by scrutinizing the investment post factum with the
intention of rooting out minor or trivial illegalities as a pretext to free themselves
of an obligation.**

According to Claimants, Colombia is submitting for the first time in this arbitration
that Claimants acted disloyally, since it never raised any complaints regarding the
information provided by Prodeco at the time of the negotiations or in the context of
the Procedure for Contractual Annulment. Similarly, no such accusations were
made by the Contraloria in the context of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.”

Prodeco was always transparent about its assumptions and about the trade-off
underpinning the Eighth Amendment: there would be a reduction in Colombia’s
royalty taken as a percentage of the total value of production; however, this
reduction would be compensated by a higher royalty associated with higher
production following expansion, and Colombia would overall receive higher
revenues.*” Claimants submit that they always discussed these assumptions with
Ingeominas, which was the State agency competent to verify the information
delivered by Prodeco.**!

In sum, Claimants argue that the Tribunal should dismiss Respondent’s Illegality
Objection.

CORRUPTION

Respondent’s first argument is that, in order to secure the Eighth Amendment,
Claimants corrupted Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas’ Director General. The corrupt
payment was allegedly disguised as the purchase price for the acquisition of the 3ha
Contract. Colombia submits that Mr. Maldonado, the co-owner of the 3ha Contract,

was in fact an associate of Mr. Ballesteros, and that both shared the USD 1.75 M
price paid by Prodeco.

Claimants deny any wrongdoing. They acknowledge the purchase of the
3ha Contract in May 2009, after having reported the situation to various Colombian
authorities, and having received no support or solution whatsoever. They also deny
that Mr. Ballesteros was the final recipient of the funds.

The Tribunal will first establish the proven facts (3.1), then explain certain issues
which arose regarding the marshalling of evidence regarding corruption (3.2), and
finally dismiss Respondent’s objection (3.3).

(3.1) PROVEN FACTS
A, The 3ha Contract

On 29 November 2006, Mr. Jorge Maldonado — a former employee of the Ministry
of Mines and of Carbocol, Ingeominas’ predecessor as mining agency of the
Republic — and his partner, Mr. César Garcia, filed a request with Ingeominas to
obtain a concession contract for the exploration and production of coal in a parcel
of 3 hectares located in the middle of the La Jagua coal mine, which was already
being exploited by Prodeco through its Affiliates.*°? The arrow in the following
map shows the tiny 3 hectares strip, surrounded by Prodeco’s mining concessions:

The Prodeco Affiliates had obtained their mining rights over the La Jagua project
from the mining agencies that had preceded Ingeominas, long before Glencore’s
involvement.°® It seems that the three-hectare gap was the result of clerical errors

in the mapping of the concessions granted in the 1990s and 2000s.°* While it
remains uncertain whether these errors were accidental or intentional, it should be
noted that Mr. Maldonado worked in Carbocol and in the subsequent mining
agencies from 1988 through 2002° and was accordingly in a position to obtain
insider information on the three-hectare gap.

Initial rejection by Ingeominas

Four months after Mr. Maldonado’s application, on 2 March 2007, Ingeominas
issued a technical report concluding that the 3ha Contract would partially overlap
with other nearby concessions and that it was too small for a standalone mining
operation.*® A week thereafter, on 17 March 2007, Ingeominas formally rejected
Mr. Maldonado’s application for the 3ha Contract.*”

There is a dispute as to whether Mr. Maldonado filed a request for reconsideration
of this decision on time. In the apparent absence of a request for reconsideration,
on 3 May 2007, Ingeominas issued a resolution declaring that its decision to reject
the application for the 3ha Contract had become final and enforceable.*®

On 11 May 2007, Mr. Maldonado contested this resolution, saying that he had
presented a request for reconsideration at Ingeominas’ offices in the city of
Valledupar on 2 May 2007. Attached to his letter was a hardly legible request for
reconsideration dated 2 May 2007.°° The request seemed to have some
irregularities, and did not contain a notary stamp, as required by law.°”° According
to Mr. Maldonado, after this incident and until April 2008, he received no further
information from Ingeominas, except that the case was still under analysis.*7!

Integrated Use Agreement

In early 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates submitted to Ingeominas a proposed Integrated
Use Agreement which would allow them to conduct joint operations in the mining
areas of the La Jagua project,*”? an agreement which Ingeominas subsequently
approved.*”? Accordingly, on 10 March 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates submitted to
Ingeominas a formal opposition to the 3ha Contract, requesting that Ingeominas:*”*

sort of authentication if Mr. Maldonado had indeed filed the recurso in person (Doc. C-209, p. 9).

- Correct the errors in the coordinates of the titles granted to the Prodeco
Affiliates, which had created the three-hectare gap; or

- Alternatively, reject the request for the 3ha Contract, because it would be
technically impractical to exploit such a small area.

Ingeominas backtracks and awards the 3ha Contract

602. Prompted by Mr. Maldonado’s request for reconsideration and by the Prodeco
Affiliates’ opposition to the 3ha Contract, Ingeominas went back to evaluate the
viability of the 3ha Contract. In June 2008, Ingeominas backtracked on its original
decision: it found that the 3ha Contract area did not overlap with other mining
concessions and revoked its rejection of Mr. Maldonado’s application.*”>

603. In July 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates filed a request for reconsideration,>”° which
Ingeominas rejected on 19 August 2008.57”

B. Prodeco Complains to Authorities

604. Prodeco was now faced with the situation that Ingeominas was about to grant the
3ha Contract to Mr. Maldonado and his partner — a concession which threatened to
disrupt the development of the La Jagua mine.*”* In this situation Prodeco decided
to complain in writing to various Colombian authorities.

605. First, on 26 August 2008, Ms. Zuleta, acting on behalf of the Prodeco Affiliates,
filed a formal complaint regarding the anomalies surrounding the 3ha Contract with
Colombia’s Procurador General de la Nacién.*” Ms. Zuleta forwarded this
complaint to the Ministro de Minas y Energia, to the Ministro de la Presidencia, to
Mr. Ballesteros, and to the Contraloria.>®° In particular, the Prodeco Affiliates
explained that:**!

“Si INGEOMINAS persiste en otorgar a los sefiores Maldonado Mestre y
Garcia Vargas la concesion del Grea solicitada como HKT-08031, incurre en

Second, on 22 September 2008, Ms. Zuleta approached the Procurador General
again, saying that Ingeominas’ rejection of the Prodeco Affiliates’ request for
reconsideration constituted a violation of due process and of the applicable mining
provisions. Ms. Zuleta emphasised that the Procurador General should investigate
the fact that the 3ha Contract had been awarded to an ex-employee of the agency,
since there had been clear irregularities and an undue use of insider information.***
This letter was, once again, forwarded to the Ministro de Minas y Energia, the
Ministro de la Presidencia and the Contraloria.**

Third, on 6 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates sent a complaint to Mr. Ballesteros
and Mr. Edward Franco (with copy to the Procurador General, the Ministro de
Minas y Energia, the Ministro de la Presidencia and the Contraloria), asking
Ingeominas to review the 3ha Contract and to refrain from granting, or at least from
registering, the 3ha Contract.**+

Fourth, on 10 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates asked the Jefe del Registro
Minero Nacional (with copy to the Procurador General, the Ministro de Minas y
Energia, the Ministro de la Presidencia and the Contraloria) to refrain from
registering the 3ha Contract, claiming that he had a duty to the defend the national
interest.>8

Did these repeated complaints produce any effect?

Respondent has not provided evidence of any reaction from any of the Colombian
authorities to whom Prodeco complained. There is also no written record of any of
these authorities taking any action to rectify the situation.**°

Execution of the 3ha Contract

partner finally executed the 3ha Contract, and thus became the owners of the three-
hectare mining concession.”

Prodeco’s reaction did not take long to materialize: on 21 November 2008,
Ms. Zuleta asked Ingeominas’ Coordinador del Grupo de Control Interno
Disciplinario to open a disciplinary investigation against the employees involved
in awarding the 3ha Contract (with copy to the Procurador General, the Ministro
de Minas y Energia, the Ministro de Presidencia, the Director del Programa
Presidencial de Lucha contra la Corrupcion, and the Contraloria).*** And in
February 2009 Prodeco’s external counsel filed a citizen’s suit (accidn popular)
against Ingeominas and Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia based on the irregularities
surrounding the 3ha Contract.>*?

No negative inference

Respondent argues that Claimants’ failure to deliver documents responsive to
Colombia’s request to produce documents exchanged or reviewed by management
related to the challenge of the 3ha Contract, should lead the Tribunal to infer:

- that Prodeco was aware that the challenge would end up on Mr. Ballestero’s
desk, and

- that Prodeco “[w]anted to address the consequences of Ingeominas’ decision to
grant the 3ha Contract directly with [Mr.] Ballesteros”.°°”

The argument is a non sequitur. Furthermore, there is overwhelming evidence
proving Prodeco’s repeated complaints to the highest administrative authorities
within the Republic.

C. CDJ Buys the 3ha Contract

In the meantime, in December 2008, Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia had
approached Prodeco through an intermediary, offering to sell the 3ha Contract for
USD 11 M.**! Messrs. Maldonado and Garefa knew that the three-hectare area was
fundamental for La Jagua’s integrated project. Prodeco, on the other hand, initially
feigned not to be interested in acquiring the area.>””

$ 1007000 is too high””.

But when the mining operations in La Jagua were starting to surround the 3 hectare
concession, Prodeco was left with little option: either to mine around the area,
which would imply losing up to 11 million tonnes of coal, or to buy out
Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia.**?

Further complaint

At the end of March 2009,°% Prodeco made a last complaint to the Ministro de
Presidencia about the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract. Prodeco warned
that the lack of a solution to the 3ha Contract situation would leave Prodeco with
no option other than to engage in direct negotiations with Messrs. Maldonado and
Gareia:5°

“A pesar de lo anterior a la fecha, seis meses después de otorgado el contrato
de in HKT-08031 la administracién no_ha_iniciado i igacior
sobre los hechos mencionados y los titulares del contrato de concesién HKT-
08031 no_han_iniciado actividad exploratoria_ alguna, a pesar de que la
Operacién Conjunta ha permitido el acceso al drea siempre que ha sido
solicitado.

La Operacién Conjunta se vio obligada a modificar su plan minero, lo cual
significa menos toneladas de carbén explotadas, menos regalias y menos
generacion de empleo.

La demora en la solucién de esta situacién, de otra parte, obligard a la
Operacién Conjunta a aceptar una comunicacién directa con los titulares del
contrato de c in HKT-08031, lo cual es li contrario a sus
intereses y a su politica, pero la Operacién Conjunta no puede seguir viendo
cémo se afecta su operacién minera sin que se adelante actuacién alguna
para corregir la situacién creada por INGEOMINAS”. [Emphasis added]

Once again faced with the silence of the Colombian authorities, Prodeco eventually
settled for the alternative of buying out the 3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado
and Garcia.

The purchase

The transaction took place on 4 May 2009:°%° Ms. Elsa Aragon Barrera, acting on
behalf of and in representation of Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garcia, executed the

version of the Contract, the price paid was redacted.*°*

Ingeominas approved the Assignment Contract on 8 May 2009, and the transaction
was registered on 27 May 2009.°”

Payment of the Purchase Price

The Assignment Contract provided that CDJ should make the payments due in
Colombian Pesos, in two designated accounts opened in two Colombian banks
(Banco Davivienda and Banco Occidente).©° There is evidence that CDJ, a
Colombian company affiliated to Prodeco, made the payments by transferring funds
to the sellers’ accounts located in Colombia and identified in the Assignment
Contract.!

There is also evidence in the file that, once payment had been made, CDJ made the
appropriate tax withholding required under Colombian tax law.%°

The transaction was also reflected in CDJ’s audited financial statements of February
2010,°° and on 1 February 2010, CDJ informed Ingeominas that it had acquired
the 3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia, this time disclosing the
consideration of USD 1.75 M paid to both.°*

Further Complaints

There is also evidence that even after the Assignment Contract was executed,
Prodeco continued to complain about the irregular character of the grant of the
three-hectare concession to Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia.

Mr. Oscar Paredes, Respondent’s witness in this arbitration, who replaced
Mr. Ballesteros as Director General of Ingeominas, recalls that Dra. Zuleta
personally raised the issue with him:°>

D. Public Statement of New Minister

627. In August 2010, President Santos took office and Mr. Carlos Rodado became
Minister of Mines and Energy. At a press conference held in May 2011, Mr. Rodado
acknowledged that irregularities had occurred in the granting of mining licenses.
Certain well-connected individuals had been able to register mining licenses in
small strategic areas, in order to “greenmail” owners of adjacent mining
exploitations:°°°

“Que les permiten negociar con los dos titulares vecinos. Los titulares vecinos
pueden ser uno mismo. Tienen un Grea aqui, y tiene otra area, pero aqui se
mete un corredor. Y este senor del corredor adquiere digamos un poder de
negociaci6n y vende estos titulos a un precio alto, altisimo y los que quieren,
las_empresas ellas que quieren _hacer_una_explotacién_que_permita_un
aprovech racional de los recursos tienen que comprarle al precio que
este especulador quiere cobrar.

Y aqui quiero hacer una declaracion. La_gran mayoria de las empresas
mineras que trabajan en Colombia son unas empresas serias [...] y ellos son
los primeros interesados en que haya transparencia y que haya un manejo
eficiente, y estan coor do y colab do en que las ii igacit que se
hagan den resultados. Porque este tipo de maniobras son las que impiden
realmente que podamos hacer un desarrollo, primero sostenible, segundo de
aprovechamiento racional de los yacimientos, y tercero, un aprovechamiento
verdaderamente transparente, honesto, de la mineria en Colombia. [...]

Entonces, el duefio de este titulo y el duefio de este, que es uno mismo, pues
tiene que entrar en negociaci6n y comprar el derecho de este titulo a un precio
altisimo. Y si es de un ex funcionario de una de las entidades que han
manejado la mineria en Colombia, esto se vuelve también un caso de
verdadera duda que merece ser investigado por los organismos competentes.
Nosotros obviamente tenemos nombres de quienes son los titulares de todo
esto, pero nosotros obviamente no somos organismo de investigacién, no
somos 6rgano de control, no somos poder judicial, pero pondremos todo esto
en manos de las autoridades pertinentes”. [Emphasis added]

628. It is noteworthy that during this press conference Minister Rodado used a
PowerPoint presentation in which Prodeco’s three-hectare concession was clearly
visible,” and that in his public statement there is no allegation that Prodeco had

bribed any public official or had otherwise engaged in improper conduct. To the
contrary, he explicitly stated that most mining companies working in Colombia
were responsible enterprises. At that time, criticism was directed at the former
Ingeominas employees who had granted the irregular mining contracts.

Although Minister Rodado announced “pondremos todo esto en manos de las
autoridades pertinentes”, there is no information in the file showing that any
Colombian authority commenced a formal investigation into the events surrounding
the 3ha Contract (or any of the other analogous irregular situations).

E. No Reference to Corruption nor to the 3ha Contract

Minister Rodado never accused Prodeco or Glencore of improper behaviour — to
the contrary, he portrayed mining companies in general as victims of greenmail,
permitted by the unscrupulous behaviour of certain civil servants and insiders.

There is also no accusation of corruption in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. In this
extensive and thoroughly researched administrative file, the Contraloria never
alleged that Prodeco had bribed Mr. Ballesteros; in fact, there is no reference at all
to the 3ha Contract.

The Contaloria’s Decision and the Appeal Decision found that Prodeco had acted
with dolo, in essence because, when negotiating the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco
was considered to have taken advantage of the frailty of Ingeominas and had
advanced its own interests to the detriment of those of Colombia. But in the course
of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, there is no indication that either Prodeco or its
parent Glencore had engaged in the corruption of public officials.°*

The same is true for the Procedure for Contractual Annulment filed by the new
mining agencies that succeeded Ingeominas: in their submissions to the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca, the SGC and the ANM never raised any
accusation that either Prodeco or its parent Glencore had engaged in corruption of
public officials.

F, The 2017 Criminal Complaint

The argument that Prodeco had bribed Mr. Ballesteros was formally raised by
Colombia for the first time on Sunday, 10 September 2017, when the Director of
ANDJE — the agency which provides legal support to the Colombian State — filed
with the Public Prosecutor a Criminal Complaint against (unnamed) officers of
Prodeco and Glencore and against civil servants in Ingeominas.°?

Pro memoria: Claimants had commenced this investment arbitration a year and a
half earlier, in March 2016. Colombia’s Counter-Memorial, dated 16 November
2017 (i.e. one month after the Criminal Complaint), devoted only a few paragraphs

to this accusation,°!® which was fully developed for the first time in Respondent’s
Reply on Preliminary Objections and Rejoinder on the Merits of April 2018.°!!

Since the copy of the Criminal Complaint submitted in this arbitration procedure is
heavily redacted, significant portions of it remain unknown to this Tribunal. In the
unredacted part, the ANDJE provides the factual background to the 3ha Contract
(see section III.(3). supra), gives a summary of the facts surrounding the
negotiation and execution of the Eighth Amendment, and submits a list of articles
of the Colombian Criminal Code which might have been violated.

The Criminal Complaint does not accuse any individual persons of having
committed specific forms of illegal conduct, but simply asks the Fiscalia to
investigate and to determine:°!”

“[...] responsables por la presunta comisién de los delitos de cohecho,
celebracién de contrato sin cumplimiento de requisitos legales, interés
indebido en la celebraci6n de contratos, concierto para delinquir, trdfico de
influencias y trdafico de influencia de particular, por los hechos que se
describen a continuacion, relacionados con el desarrollo de actividades de
agentes de la empresa CI Prodeco S.A. [...] subsidiaria de la multinacional
suiza Glencore International AG [...], perpetrados durante los afios 2009 y
2010”.

There is no evidence in the file that, upon receipt of the Criminal Complaint, the
Fiscalia carried out any investigation or indicted any individual because of such
Criminal Complaint.

(3.2) THE PROCEDURAL INCIDENT
The allegations of corruption also provoked a relevant procedural incident.

On 17 July 2017, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial together with certain
exhibits.

Ten days thereafter, Claimants submitted a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal averring
that 41 of these exhibits were private e-mail chains exchanged between
Claimants’ management and their in-house and external counsel [previously
defined as the “Disputed Documents”). Claimants requested that the Tribunal
exclude such documents from the evidence.°!

On 3 August 2017, Respondent reacted to Claimants’ allegations, explaining that
the Disputed Documents had been legally obtained by the Superintendencia de
Industria y Comercio [the “SIC”] in the context of a preliminary investigation into

unfair practices by Prodeco and its affiliates at Puerto Nuevo. Respondent requested
that the Tribunal declare the Disputed Documents to be admissible evidence.°!*

Both Parties reiterated their requests in their reply and rejoinder letters presented
on 22 August 2017°' and 11 September 2017,°!° respectively.

The Tribunal had no direct and complete knowledge of the precise content of the
Disputed Documents,*!’ other than by reading Respondent’s Counter-Memorial
and the Criminal Complaint — which transcribed passages from some of the
Disputed Documents. The Disputed Documents apparently consisted of chains of
private e-mails sent or received by three of Claimants’ managers. Some of the
e-mails were either addressed to or sent by Claimants’ (in-house and possibly
external) lawyers.

Use of the Disputed Docume: n the arbitration

It was common ground between the Parties that the SIC had lawfully obtained the
Disputed Documents in the course of an antitrust investigation against Prodeco. Yet
the Parties disagreed on whether such Documents could lawfully be used in these
proceedings.

Claimants argued that the introduction of the Disputed Documents in this arbitration
violated Colombian Law and undermined the integrity of the proceedings by
breaching basic concepts of due process, fairness, and equality between the Parties,
as guaranteed by international law. Respondent denied this allegation.

In PO No. 2, the Tribunal ruled for Claimants. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the
introduction of the Disputed Documents into the record constituted a violation of
the international law principle that parties ought to arbitrate fairly, in good faith and
with equality of arms®'’; and that under Colombian Law, their introduction would

seem to amount to a desviacién de poder.°'?

Accordingly, the Disputed Documents were excluded from the file and Colombia
was ordered to re-submit its Counter-Memorial free of references to the Disputed
Documents and without attaching them.°?°

The Tribunal further clarified that the proper procedure for obtaining evidence from
the counterparty was through the agreed-upon document production exercise,?!
and gave the Parties the opportunity to re-submit their document production

requests.” The Tribunal then issued certain rules and recommendations for the
document production exercise.°*

Document R-100

Amongst the Disputed Documents was document R-100 [“Doc. R-100”], an email
chain exchanged in May 2009 between Prodeco’s management and its in-house
counsel (i.e. between Natalia Anaya, Gary Nagle, Chris Phillips, Margarita Zuleta,
and Tomas Lopez) which discussed the caducidad procedure and the negotiations
with Ingeominas.

Pro memoria: On 23 January 2009, Ingeominas had formally put Prodeco on notice
through a Requerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad. Ingeominas considered that
Prodeco’s unilateral interpretation of the Mining Contract amounted to a contractual
breach. By means of the Requerimiento, Ingeominas threatened Prodeco with
termination of the Contract through a declaration of caducidad if payment of the
disputed amount was not effected or an appropriate justification provided within
one month.°4

Prodeco replied to the Requerimiento on 13 February 2009, restating the reasons
for its interpretation of the Definitive Price term used in the Contract, and pointing
out that Ingeominas had not explained why it disagreed with such interpretation.°>

In April 2009, Prodeco approached Ingeominas regarding the outstanding royalty
payments and proposed paying all the disputed amounts into an escrow account,
until the dispute on the proper interpretation of the term Definitive Price had been
settled.°”° Ingeominas rejected this proposal, insisting that Prodeco must pay the
disputed amounts directly to Ingeominas in cash, before negotiations could
proceed.”

The email chain in Doc. R-100 covers precisely the week before Ingeominas
rejected Prodeco’s proposal that the payment be made to an escrow account. The
email chain starts with an e-mail sent by Ms. Natalia Anaya, Prodeco’s in-house
counsel, to Prodeco’s officers and other in-house counsel (Gary Nagle, Chris
Phillips, Margarita Zuleta, and Tomas Lopez) recounting her conversation with Ms.
Marcela Estrada, Ingeominas’ lawyer. In the e-mail, Ms. Anaya says that
Ms. Estrada confirmed her agreement with Mr. Ballesteros that Prodeco could pay
the contested sum into an escrow account to end the caducidad process: °*8

“Marcela Estrada confirmed today that she agreed with Ballesteros that they
will accept our proposal for the trust and with that they will end the caducity

process. She said that Ballesteros did not put any problems to this and that

Adolfo supported her_a_lot_so that everything was accepted easily by
Ballesteros.

She will draft the letter today and expects to issue it on Monday (as tomorrow
will be in Medellin). I asked her if we should go and talk to Ballesteros about
this and she said that it is not necessary because everything was clear for him.
However, I told her that I will be following up on Monday and if by then there
has been any issue to send us the letter, I will request the meeting with
Ballesteros.” [Emphasis added]

Mr. Nagle, Prodeco’s Chief Executive Officer at the time, responded to
Ms. Anaya’s email with the following sentence:

“Of course he now supports us, we have bought the 3has.”

The chain continues with Ms. Anaya reporting on her follow-up with Ms. Estrada,
and on the status of the letter that would in fact confirm to Prodeco that the
caducidad process would end if Prodeco paid the outstanding amounts into the
escrow account.

The email chain ends with a long email by Ms. Anaya reporting on several meetings
held at Ingeominas on 15 May 2009. Ms. Anaya explains that Ingeominas’ director,
Mr. Ballesteros, changed his mind regarding the escrow account and that the only
way to avoid caducidad would be for Prodeco to pay the disputed sum directly to
Ingeominas. Ms. Anaya recounts that Ms. Estrada told her she believed that it had
to do with the 3 hectare issue:

“First, I met with Marcela and she told me straight away that she is very
embarrassed because she assured me that everything was OK, but that Mario
yesterday had a sudden change and that (off the record) she believes it has to

do with the 3 hectares issue because he is very upset that we negotiated the
i as it made him look really bad in front of Uribe.

LJ

After the meeting, Marcela told me that she strongly considers that it is even
more risky for Ingeominas to receive a payment without a cause and then be
exposed to having to offset the money after it [has] been delivered to the
municipalities, and that she will strongly defend these arguments at their
internal meetings. But she said that it is not her decision and reiterated that
Mario is so crossed with the 3 hectares issue that she believes it will not be
easy for him to accept the trust. [...]”. [Emphasis added]

Introduction of Doc. R-100 during the Hearing

At the Hearing, counsel for Respondent stated that an email existed which showed
that the Eighth Amendment had been executed because Mr. Ballesteros was pleased
by Prodeco’s purchase of the 3ha Contract.®”? He added that the email in question,

Doc. R-54, was one of the Disputed Documents which the Tribunal had excluded
from the file in accordance with PO No. 2.

The Tribunal requested that the Parties agree? that the email in question, which
seemed a highly relevant document, be introduced into the record. Both Parties
agreed to the request, and it was further agreed to include the complete email chain
in which the email was inserted as Doc. R-100.°!

On the following day, both Parties were granted the opportunity to make brief
presentations regarding Doc. R-100 and its probative value.

Claimants asserted that Doc. R-100 showed “no link whatsoever anywhere of
anything between Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Vargas and Mr. Ballesteros”,°? while
the Republic reached the opposite conclusion.** The Tribunal will analyse Doc. R-
100 extensively in section V.1.(3.3).C infra.

(3.3) DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Colombia says that Glencore procured the Eighth Amendment through corruption.
The Tribunal takes the contention of the Republic very seriously.

Corruption is morally odious: the proper governance of public affairs and the
correct assignment of public goods is substituted by favour and arbitrariness.
Corruption is also economically deleterious: it restrains economic development and
subdues nations into under-development and poverty, as bribes enriching well-
connected civil servants or politicians are financed via inflated prices paid or
reductions in income suffered by the poorest citizens. Scarce public funds are
misdirected by enriching privileged individuals, at the expense of the common
good.

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that, provided that there are prima facie
grounds for suspecting malfeasance, an international arbitration tribunal has the
duty to investigate the facts, even sua sponte, and to take appropriate measures
under the applicable principles of law.

The Tribunal further agrees with the Republic that an investment obtained through
corruption is not protected by the Treaty. Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty expressly
require that the investments, to be protected, have to be “made in accordance with
[Colombia’s] laws and regulations.” Under Colombian law, an investor who
corrupts civil servants of the host State to procure the investment commits a
crime.**> Therefore, an investment made by corrupting the senior Colombian civil

servant in charge of supervising the mining sector would not be protected by the
Treaty.° In light of the clarity of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal
to decide, as other tribunals have done, that an investment made through corruption
would violate international public policy.”

The issue to be determined is thus not a question of material law: if Claimants have
bribed Mr. Ballesteros, disguising the corrupt payment as the consideration for the
acquisition of the 3ha Contract, the necessary consequence will be the loss of
international law protection.

The real question in this case is whether corruption has been proven.
Burden of Proof

In international law, the general principle is actori incumbit probatio: the party who
alleges a certain fact has the burden to prove it.°* The Tribunal sees no reason to
deviate from this principle. Since Colombia is alleging that the Eighth Amendment
was obtained through the corruption of Director Ballesteros, it is for Colombia to
marshal the appropriate evidence.

As for the standard to be applied to assess the evidence, the Tribunal perceives no
reason to depart from the traditional standard of preponderance of the evidence,
since neither the Treaty nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules impose a different
standard. Colombia argues, based on the approach followed by the tribunal in
Spentex, that the Tribunal should adopt a methodology of starting from “red flags”
(individual indicia of corruption) and “connecting the dots” to obtain a larger
picture:°°?

“In order to avoid making it practically impossible to prove corruption, the
Spentex tribunal considered it appropriate to connect the dots in the indicia of
corruption before it. It “applied a method of ‘connecting the dots’, thereby
assessing all individual indicia in detail and checking the plausibility of a
potential picture emerging from putting them together.” As a result, the
Spentex tribunal found that the most compelling explanation of the facts it had
considered was that there had been corruption involving the investor and
Uzbek State officials [...].” [Emphasis in the original]

In fact, what Respondent labels as “connecting the dots” is nothing else than the
time-honoured methodology followed by tribunals in all jurisdictions to establish
truth based on indicia or circumstantial evidence: if a party marshals evidence that
proves the existence of certain indicia, and it is possible to infer from these indicia
(using experience and reason) that a certain fact has occurred, the tribunal may take
such fact as established. The Tribunal has followed this methodology.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Relationship with municipal criminal investigation

As noted, corruption is a criminal offence in Colombia. In this case, the ANDJE has
filed a Criminal Complaint against officers of Glencore/Prodeco and civil servants
in Ingeominas, accusing them of corruption in the procurement of the Eighth
Amendment.™°

What is the relevance of the Criminal Complaint for the present arbitration?

The Criminal Complaint and this procedure operate in different legal spheres, are
subject to diverging standards of proof, and may reach conflicting results. The fact
that the Colombian criminal system has not punished (in fact, in accordance with
the available record, has not even investigated) the alleged corrupt practices
surrounding the Eighth Amendment, does not preclude a hypothetical finding by
this Tribunal that corruption has occurred. And vice-versa.

That said, the conclusions of the justice system at the municipal level, or absence
thereof, which have a much higher capacity of investigation than this Arbitral
Tribunal, is one of the various elements that must be considered when evaluating
the available evidence.

ak oe ok
The Tribunal will in the subsequent sections analyse the red flags identified by

Respondent (A.), and then weigh the available evidence (B.). Finally, it will devote
a section to the evidentiary value of the email chain in Doc. R-100 (C.).

A, The Red Flags

In the course of the Hearing, Respondent identified the red flags which — in its
submission — prove corruption:™!

- The payment to Mr. Maldonado and his partner,

- The fact that Mr. Maldonado was a former employee of Minercol,
- The timing of such payment,

- Claimants’ concealment of the transaction,

- Claimants’ decision to restrict knowledge of the transaction to three members of
its top management, and

- The fact that the Eighth Amendment was executed in open disregard of the
applicable law and regulations.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

The Tribunal will analyse these indicia in turn.
a. The Payment to Mr. Maldonado and his Partner

Respondent says that Claimants paid a strikingly high price of USD 1.75 M for the
3ha Contract.”

It is undisputed that Prodeco, through one of its Affiliates, made a payment of
USD 1.75 M for the 3ha Contract to Mr. Jorge Maldonado (a former employee of
the predecessors of Ingeominas) and his partner, and in exchange secured the
mining rights for a small plot located in the middle of the La Jagua mine. But the
transaction must be viewed in its proper context.

The Tribunal recalls the press conference held in May 2011 by Colombia’s then-
Minister of Mines, Mr. Carlos Rodado, where he acknowledged that the granting of
mining licenses had been plagued by irregularities, and that certain well-connected
individuals, using privileged information, had been able to register mining licenses
in small strategic areas, adjacent to substantial mines, with the purpose of selling
these licenses at an exorbitant price. And as an example of such greenmail, the
Minister specifically referred to the La Jagua mine and the 3ha Contract. He
explicitly stated that most mining companies working in Colombia were
responsible enterprises, and his criticism was directed to the Colombian mining
agencies, which had irregularly awarded licenses for the benefit of certain
insiders.

The Tribunal also recalls that Prodeco vigorously and repeatedly objected to the
concession of the 3ha Contract to Mr. Maldonado, and that the objections were
dismissed by Ingeominas.“ Prodeco complained not less than four times in writing
to at least five authorities within the Colombian government (Procurador General,
Ministro de Minas y Energia, Ministro de la Presidencia, Contraloria and
Ingeominas), denouncing the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract. The
complaints did not elicit any material reaction from the authorities.

In the absence of support from the public administration, Prodeco negotiated with
Mr. Maldonado the purchase of the 3ha Contract, to minimize the losses of having
to mine around his concession. But before doing so, Prodeco made a last plea to the
Ministro de la Presidencia, reiterating that the administration had failed to launch
any investigation into the irregularities, and declaring that it was being forced to
submit to the greenmail (“aceptar una comunicacién directa con los titulares del
contrato de concesién’”).°°

This last plea also remained unanswered. Only thereafter did Prodeco execute the
Assignment Contract.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

The Tribunal does not see any illegality or impropriety in the transaction. It is true
that Prodeco yielded to greenmail — but it was a greenmail caused by Ingeominas’
inappropriate registration of the 3ha Contract in favour of Mr. Maldonado, and the
Colombian authorities’ unwillingness or inability to react, notwithstanding repeated
warnings and complaints.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that Prodeco’s behaviour is exactly the opposite to that
normally adopted in cases of bribery. Corruption requires secrecy. In this case,
Prodeco announced urbi et orbi that it was being subjected to greenmail and
requested assistance from the public administration. When the authorities offered
no support, Prodeco informed ex ante not less than the Ministro de la Presidencia
that it was being forced to buy the 3ha Contract.

Excessive payment

Respondent also says that the payment made to Mr. Maldonado and his partner was
excessive.

The available evidence shows that Prodeco negotiated the price: Mr. Maldonado
initially asked for USD 10 per tonne,“*° but eventually settled for the much lower
amount of USD 1.75 M. Taking into consideration that the mining operations were
approaching the 3ha Contract, and would be severely affected if the 3ha plot had to
be excluded, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent’s unsubstantiated
argument that the price was excessive.”

b. = Mr. Maldonado was a Former Employee of Minercol and Carbocol

Respondent argues that Mr. Maldonado was a former employee of Ingeominas’
predecessors, and as such he was “closely connected” to the Director General of
Ingeominas, Mr. Ballesteros.*8

The first part of the averment is documented: in accordance with an official
certificate, Mr. Maldonado was employed by Carbocol, Ecocarbén, and Minercol
between 1998 and 2002 as a “Profesional especializado”, his work relationship with
these agencies ending in the northern city of Valledupar on 30 June 2002.

Mr. Ballesteros, a political appointee, did not begin his tenure until 2007, i.e. five
years thereafter, and was based in Colombia’s capital city, Bogota, 850 km south
of Valledupar.°°

Colombia has failed to marshal any evidence suggesting that there was any
connection, let alone a close one, between Mr. Maldonado, or his associate Mr.

46 Doc. R-280 (Email from A. Lopez dated 14 December 2008).

7 The USD 100,000 figure, repeatedly invoked by Respondent (R II, paras. 52 and 411), is not an internal
valuation; it is a recommendation between two Prodeco officers on how to negotiate with Mr. Maldonado
(see Doc. R-280, p. 1).

Garcia, and Mr. Ballesteros. They worked at different agencies, in different
locations, with a time gap of five years.

No negative inference

Respondent adds that Claimants’ failure to produce management documents
responsive to Colombia’s requests should induce the Tribunal to infer

- that Mr. Ballesteros had a direct interest in the consideration paid by Prodeco

and

- that through the payment of an exorbitant payment Claimants secured Mr.

Ballesteros’ support.*!
The Tribunal disagrees.

Respondent had asked in the document production exercise for internal
management documents regarding the negotiations with Mr. Maldonado, and
Respondent now complains that no (or only a few) internal documents have been
produced. The complaint is baseless. Prodeco had no obligation to prepare internal
memoranda justifying its negotiations with Mr. Maldonado. The existence or non-
existence of such documentation does not prove the involvement of Director
Ballesteros, nor that the payment eventually benefitted Director Ballesteros.

c. The Timing of the Payments

Colombia says that only 10 days after Prodeco was served notice of the resolution
approving the assignment of the 3ha Contract, and only six days before such
assignment was registered at the Mining Registry, Director Ballesteros caused
Ingeominas to enter into the Commitment to Negotiate.°*

On 4 May 2009, Prodeco and Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia executed the
Assignment Agreement, transferring the 3ha Contract and receiving the USD 1.75
M consideration. A few days thereafter, on 21 May 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas
signed the Commitment to Negotiate, which eventually led to the execution of the
final version of the Eighth Amendment on 22 January 2010.

d. Claimants’ Concealment of the Transaction

Respondent says that Prodeco tried to conceal the acquisition of the 3ha Contract
and draws the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that the request for approval of
the assignment of the 3ha Contract did not specify the purchase price, which was
instead recorded as “US$xxxx”.°3

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

As a preliminary observation, it seems that it was not Prodeco who submitted the
draft Assignment Contract to Ingeominas for approval, but rather Ms. Elsa Aragén
Barrera, acting on behalf of Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garcia.°™4

In any event, it is true that the Assignment Contract which was submitted to
Ingeominas for approval did not contain the price details.°* But it is undisputed
that there was no legal obligation to indicate the purchase price in the form
requesting registration of the assignment—°°° Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia and
Prodeco made the submission in the customary manner, deleting the purchase price.

In addition, in all subsequent public statements, Prodeco did not conceal the
acquisition or the consideration paid:

- On 1 February 2010, CDJ (Prodeco’s Affiliate which had executed the

Assignment Contract) complied with its contractual duty to disclose to
Ingeominas all assets and services acquired in the course of the preceding year;
in that disclosure the payment of USD 1.75 M to Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia
was properly disclosed;°”

- CDJ made the appropriate tax withholding required under Colombian tax law;°*

- The transaction was also reflected in CDJ’s audited financial statements for

2009.9
e. Restriction of Knowledge to Top Management

Respondent says that only the top management of Prodeco (Mr. Phillips, Mr. Lopez,
Ms. Zuleta, and Mr. Nagle) were aware of the amount which was being paid by
CDJ, and that this reinforces a finding that Prodeco intended to conceal the
transaction.°

The Tribunal acknowledges that in an email dated 1 May 2009, it was agreed that
information within the company should be restricted to Mr. Phillips, Ms. Zuleta,
and Mr. Nagle.®*!

But Claimants have convincingly explained that this restriction only operated prior
to the closing of the 3ha Contract — a standard practice, Claimants say, to avoid
information leaks. But once the deal had been closed, information pertaining to the
transaction was made available to other officers of Prodeco, and by the date of

payment of the second instalment (on 28 May 2009), at least eight additional
employees had been made aware of the deal and of the consideration paid.°?

f. Disregard of Mandatory Regulations

704. Respondent says further that, because of Claimants’ undue influence, Mr.
Ballesteros disregarded applicable laws and regulations when negotiating and
approving the Eighth Amendment.®? Respondent avers that Director Ballesteros
did not submit the Eighth Amendment to the Consejo Directivo (infra, (i)), and that
he failed to request mandatory advice from Ingeominas’ Contracting Committee
(ii).

(i) Consejo Directivo

705. Under Colombian law, Ingeominas did not require approval of its Consejo Directivo
in order to conclude the Eighth Amendment. This conclusion derives from Decree
252 of 2004, which does not include among the functions of the Consejo Directivo
the approval of mining contracts or their amendments, a point that was confirmed
by the former Ministro de Minas y Energia, Mr. Martinez Torres.°

706. In August 2009, Ingeominas had approved a document called “Guia de
Fiscalizacién de Proyectos de Interés Nacional”, which provided guidelines on the
internal procedures to be followed when dealing with Proyectos de Interés
Nacional.® This Guia was an internal document, drafted within Ingeominas, to
structure its procedures when handling national interest mining projects.°”

707. The Guia confirms that proposals for the approval of mining contracts are presented
to the Consejo Directivo for a “recommendation”, not for its approval:

“Se analiza y se evaliia la propuesta en reunién de Consejo Directivo, donde
ienda sobre su aceptaci6n, rechazo 0 ipl y aclaraciones si
es del caso”. [Emphasis added]

In accordance with these Guidelines, the Consejo Directivo of Ingeominas was
informed on at least seven occasions of the progress in the negotiation of the Eighth
Amendment ~ as reflected in its official minutes (see section III.(4) supra).

The two most relevant meetings of the Consejo Directivo were those held on
10 December 2009 (after the execution of the Initial Version of the Eighth
Amendment) and on 26 January 2010 (after the execution of the final version of the
Eighth Amendment).

Meeting of the Consejo Directivo on 10 December 2009

On 10 December 2009 (one day after execution of the Initial Version of the Eighth
Amendment), Ingeominas held a meeting of the Consejo Directivo® at which
Ms. Aristizdbal appeared and submitted a report summarizing the terms of the
Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.°”

Minister Hernan Martinez Torres testified in the Contraloria proceeding that he
disagreed with the signed Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, that he asked
for his disagreement to be included in the minutes, and that it was agreed to create
a task force to analyse whether the changes were in the interest of the Nation.”!
The official minutes simply say that the Minister and the remaining members
requested that the issue be re-examined in more detail taking into account the
national interest.°”

In any case, Director Ballesteros did not feel comfortable going forward without
the support of his Board, and consequently he decided to approach Prodeco and to
renegotiate the deal, seeking to accommodate the Consejo’s recommendation.

Meeting of the Consejo Directivo on 26 January 2010

The next meeting of the Consejo Directivo was held on 26 January 2010, four days
after the execution of the final version of the Eighth Amendment.

This time it was Mr. Ballesteros himself who informed the board members that the
Eighth Amendment had been signed “teniendo en cuenta las sugerencias emitidas
por ellos en consejos anteriores”. He then provided detailed information of the
agreed changes.°”> The minutes do not reflect any reaction from the Consejeros.

(ii) Contracting Committee

Respondent says that the Eighth Amendment should have been submitted to and
discussed before the so-called Contracting Committee — and that Director
Ballesteros, as a result of Claimants’ undue influence, failed to do so.

The Comité de Contratacién Minera was created in June 2004 by an Ingeominas
Resolution, later amended in September 2004.74 While under the June 2004
Resolution the Contracting Committee was requested to provide advice to the
Director regarding all contracts affecting “mediana y gran mineria”, the September
2004 Resolution reduced the scope of the Committee’s functions. Under the
September 2004 Resolution, the Committee was required to provide advice only
when the Direcci6n del Servicio Minero, or the Subdirecciones de Contratacién y
Titulacién Minera y Fiscalizacién y Ordenamiento Minero asked for its
participation:°”>

“[...] en los asuntos que por su complejidad o importancia para el sector
minero, sean presentados al Comité [...]”.

It seems that Director Ballesteros chose not to convene the Contracting Committee
to seek its advice regarding the Eighth Amendment — as he was entitled to do under
the September 2004 Resolution. Instead, Director Ballesteros relied on a group of
Ingeominas civil servants — comprising engineers, economists, and legal counsel —
who participated in the negotiations and advised him. Whether this was or not a
wise decision is not for the Tribunal to gauge. What is relevant is that Mr.
Ballesteros did not disregard any mandatory regulation.°”°

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that Director Ballesteros did not disregard any
mandatory regulation in the way that he handled the negotiation and approval of the
Eighth Amendment — and consequently this episode constitutes no red flag.

The Tribunal’s conclusion is shared by the new agencies created to substitute
Ingeominas. These agencies - AMN and SGC ~— filed in 2012 the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment of the Eighth Amendment before the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca. The request for annulment was based on the
argument that the Eighth Amendment had failed to meet its purpose and was
detrimental to the interest of the State’ — not that it had been negotiated and
executed in disregard of mandatory regulations.°”

4 Doc. R-10; Doc. R-11.

5 Doc. R-11, Art. 1.

616 This conclusion is fatal for Respondent’s request for negative inferences in para. 995 of R II.

7 Doc. C-140.

678 Respondent has also mentioned that Ingeominas failed to obtain external advice. The argument carries
no weight, since there is no mandatory rule which requires Ingeominas to obtain external advice.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

g. Destination of Payments

Respondent says that Claimants have not provided any details regarding the
destination to which they transferred their payments for the 3ha Contract.°”

The evidence proves otherwise.

Prodeco has established that the payments to Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia were
made on-shore, in Colombian Pesos, and deposited into two identified bank
accounts opened with Colombian banks, as established in the Assignment
Contract.’ There is also evidence on the record that, once payment had been
made, CDJ made the appropriate tax withholding required under Colombian tax
law. 1

B. Weighing of the Evidence

Respondent asked that the Tribunal adopt the methodology of “connecting the dots”
between certain “red flags,” in order to reach the conclusion that Prodeco had bribed
Director Ballesteros, and that the illicit payment had been concealed in the
consideration paid for the 3ha Contract. The Tribunal has carefully analysed the
alleged red flags but is unable to make the inference proposed by Colombia.

(i) As regards the alleged first red flag, the Tribunal notes that Prodeco became the
victim of a case of greenmailing, due to the improper functioning of Colombia’s
successive mining agencies, that Prodeco resisted the transaction with all its means,
that it complained repeatedly to at least five Governmental authorities, and that it
warned the Ministro de la Presidencia before yielding to the extortion.

This behaviour is antagonistic to and incompatible with Respondent’s accusation
that Claimants, through the acquisition of the 3ha Contract, were surreptitiously
bribing Director Ballesteros.

(ii) As regards the second red flag, Colombia has failed to marshal any evidence
linking Mr. Maldonado and Director Ballesteros.

The only connection proven by Respondent is that Mr. Maldonado had been an
employee of a predecessor of Ingeominas, in the southern part of Colombia, five
years before Mr. Ballesteros was appointed Director General of Ingeominas.
Mr. Maldonado’s historic experience in the mining agency might explain why he
had the insider knowledge and connections with former colleagues which permitted
him to secure the 3ha Contract. But it does not show any link to Mr. Ballesteros.

(iii) The third red flag is based on a chronological sequence, which starts with the
Assignment Agreement, leads in a few days to the Commitment to Negotiate and
six months thereafter to the execution of the Eighth Amendment.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

This alleged red flag is based on the logical fallacy post hoc, ergo propter hoc. This
fallacy is a particularly tempting error, because there is an unconcious bias which
equates temporal correlation with causality. This may be true in certain situations,
but it can be radically false in others. A conclusion cannot be based exclusively on
the order of events, but must consider other factors potentially responsible for the
result.

Furthermore, the evidence shows that the date of the Assignment Agreement was
triggered by the fact that Prodeco’s mining activities were fast approaching the 3ha
strip. There is no evidence linking the Assignment Agreement with the
Commitment to Negotiate.

(iv) The fourth and fifth red flags also fail to indicate corruption.

The evidence shows that Prodeco did not adopt any special measures to conceal the
3ha Contract and the payment to Mr. Maldonado and his partner, but that it handled
information affecting the 3ha Contract respecting regulations and in accordance
with customary practice.

(v) The sixth alleged red flag is also not a proven fact. There is no evidence that Mr.
Ballesteros disregarded applicable laws and regulations when negotiating and
approving the Eighth Amendment.

(vi) There is a final red flag, which in fact is a “green flag.” Contrary to
Respondent’s allegation, Prodeco paid Messrs. Maldonado and Garcia not
off-shore, not in an obscure jurisdiction or through some scheme for concealment.
Prodeco effected payment into two Colombian bank accounts opened in the name
of the recipients, in Colombian pesos and thereafter it made the requisite tax
withholding.

Prodeco’s conduct shows no intention of concealment, nor any impropriety.

aK

Summing up, the Tribunal rejects Colombia’s allegation that Prodeco wilfully
designed the 3ha Contract as a means to bribe Mr. Ballesteros. The dots simply do
not connect.

If Prodeco’s intention had been to corrupt Ingeominas, it would not have filed
multiple administrative appeals to prevent the grant of the 3ha Contract, it would
not have repeatedly complained to the highest Colombian authorities, and it would
not have made the payments on-shore, subject to the mandatory tax withholding.

The Tribunal’s conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the Colombian criminal
prosecutor and the Colombian criminal courts, which have a much higher capacity
for investigation than this Arbitral Tribunal, have not initiated an investigation into
the alleged corrupt practices surrounding the Eighth Amendment either in tempore
insuspecto or even after the start of this arbitration.

C. The Probative Value of the Email Chain in Doc. R-100

739. On the third day of the Hearing the Parties had the opportunity to make allegations
on the evidentiary value of Doc. R-100.

Claimants’ position

740. Claimants submitted that Doc. R-100 showed no link between Mr. Maldonado and
Mr. Vargas and Mr. Ballesteros,°*? and hence no proof of corruption could be
derived from said document.

Respondent’s position
741. Respondent made four comments regarding Doc. R-100:

- First, that there was no doubt that the “he” Mr. Nagle is referring to is
684

Mr. Ballesteros;

- Second, that Doc. R-100 confirms the direct link between the 3ha Contract and
the Commitment to Negotiate, because the subject of the e-mail was “Royalties-
Caducity update” and Mr. Ballesteros agreed to finalize the caducidad
proceedings, precisely in the Commitment to Negotiate, the agreement which
led to the execution of the Eighth Amendment;®®>

- Third, regarding the timing of Mr. Nagle’s email, it was sent on 7 May 2009, 72
hours after Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garcia requested Mr. Ballesteros to approve
the 3ha assignment to CDJ; and two days after Mr. Nagle’s e-mail, the 3ha
Contract was assigned to CDIJ;°*° thus, by 7 May 2009, Mr. Ballesteros must
have already known that the 3ha Assignment had been signed;°*”

- Fourth, regarding the addressees of Mr. Nagle’s email: the email was sent only
to Prodeco’s top management (except for Ms. Anaya), and this shows the
secrecy red flag.°*

Mr. Nagle’s testimony

742. Mr. Nagle testified in the course of the Hearing, and under oath he explained the
context and meaning of Doc. R-100:°°?

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

reaction was and explain in context what essentially you're saying in that
response to Ms. Anaya.

A. Well, for a long time, Ingeominas were very much against this idea of an
escrow. They told us pay, or we are going to declare caducity and cancel your
Contract, and they had quite a firm position on it.

At the same time as you're aware we had an issue of a 3-hectare Concession
in La Jagua, which we were very concerned about, and had--and Ingeominas
had been unable to resolve our concerns. We, therefore, had been writing to
various and many arms of government to ask them to assist. We understand
as a result of this, the Head of Ingeominas, Mr. Ballesteros, came under a lot
of pressure. My reaction to Natalia's e-mail was on the basis that just before
this discussion, we had ultimately found us buying the 3-hectare Concession
despite the fact that we didn't want to buy it. We felt it had been awarded
inappropriately. It never should have been awarded. We got to a stage where
we were forced to buy this Concession, and I felt at the time that by the fact
that we had bought the Cc ion, Mr. Ball had probably figured that
all that pressure would go away because now we had the Concession.

In his mind, I thought this would be over, and we could go back to a normal
discussion over this, over, whatever issues we have without him being--feeling
under pressure, that there is some other, let's say, complaints to relevant
authorities.

Q. Thank you. I'd like you to now look at the last mail in the chain, which is
the e-mail from Ms. Anaya of that date reporting on a meeting she had at
Ingeominas. If you could just briefly look through that e-mail, particularly
focusing, perhaps, on the first few paragraphs.

A. Yes.

Q. What did you understand Mr. Ballesteros's reaction to the 3-hectare
transaction to be from Ms. Anaya's report?

A. Well, originally, I thought that he would be relieved that the 3-hectare issue
had been resolved in his mind because we had bought it, and that's why I felt
he would be as I wrote in my e-mail.

 

 

 

However, it seems that the opposite had happened. I do recall we had written
to the President's Office. I think Claudia Jiménez was the Head of that office
at that time. Soon before finalizing the 3-hectare transaction, we had advised
the President's office of the facts of matter and it urgently needed to be
resolved, and in the absence of it being resolved by Government, we would
have been forced to effectively buy the Concession.

It seemed that the fact that we transacted and bought the Concession reflected
badly on President Uribe, who was at that time quite vocal in his pursuit of
corruption and didn't want anything to taint the name of his Government. He
was coming up to the end of his term, and he didn't want anything tainting the
name of his Government or anything further.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

As a result of us buying this, this obviously upset President Uribe, and I
suspect that he obviously took it out on Mr. Ballesteros because it reflected
badly on the President.

 

So, what I--what my suspicion was in the original e-mail on the 7th of May
turned out to not be true.” [Emphasis added]

The Tribunal’s position
The Tribunal finds Mr. Nagle’s explanations convincing.

In his email, the words used by Mr. Nagle were these: “Of course he [Director
Ballesteros] now supports us, we have bought the 3has.”

Respondent construes these words to be an acknowledgement that Prodeco had
bribed Mr. Ballesteros through the purchase of the 3ha Contract. Mr. Nagle’s
construction is totally different. He explains that Prodeco had been writing to
various Ministries and authorities within the Colombian public administration,
complaining that Ingeominas’ decision to grant the 3ha Contract to Messrs.
Maldonado and Garcia was highly irregular and requesting that steps be taken to
undo such decision. Eventually, Prodeco gave in, and decided to acquire the 3ha
Contract. In that context, Mr. Nagle thought that Mr. Ballesteros would be relieved
that Prodeco had “solved” the situation by yielding to the greenmail.

The Tribunal finds Mr. Nagle’s explanation of his words convincing. Such
construction is also confirmed by the following messages in the R-100 email chain:
Mr. Nagle’s assumption that Mr. Ballesteros would be satisfied proved totally
wrong. Ms. Anaya, an employee of Prodeco, held a meeting at Ingeominas a week
later and was told that Mr. Ballesteros was not happy at all with the execution of
the 3ha Contract, because the matter had reached President Uribe, and the President
was not satisfied at all as to how the problem had been solved.

Summing up, Doc. R-100, and particularly Mr. Nagle’s email of 7 May 2009, do
not undermine the conclusion reached by the Arbitral Tribunal that Respondent has
failed to marshal any evidence proving that Prodeco corrupted Ingeominas’
Director Ballesteros in order to procure the Eighth Amendment.

BAD FAITH

Colombia submits a second argument: that Claimants’ investment was secured
through misrepresentation, concealment, and bad faith. Respondent says that
Prodeco misrepresented the economic situation of the project in order to persuade
Ingeominas that under the Mining Contract expanding coal production beyond 8
MTA was not economically feasible. Claimants deliberately and in bad faith
withheld geological, technical, and pricing information from Ingeominas, thus
rendering the agency unable to properly assess Prodeco’s economic proposals.°”°

Claimants deny having misrepresented or concealed any information from
Ingeominas. That said, they add, even if Colombia’s mischaracterization of
Claimants’ conduct were correct, there would still be no ground for a jurisdictional
objection.°*!

The Tribunal will first establish the proven facts regarding the negotiation of the
Eighth Amendment (4.1) and then it will state its decision (4.2).

(4.1) PROVEN FACTS

A. Prodeco’s Initial Proposals

Six months after executing the Seventh Amendment, Prodeco decided to approach
Ingeominas and to propose a new amendment to the Mining Contract.”

On 23 May 2008, Prodeco’s representatives met with Director Ballesteros, and
made a presentation, based on an extensive PowerPoint, suggesting a revision of
the economic conditions of the Mining Contract.©° A few days later, on 28 May,
Prodeco submitted a nine-page formal request.®* Prodeco argued that the existing
compensation arrangement compromised the potential expansion and even the
viability of the Calenturitas mining project.°

Thus, Prodeco proposed that, in order to guarantee the sustainability of Colombia’s
returns and the viability of the mining project, certain conditions agreed upon in the
Mining Contract should be amended:°”°

- Replacing the ICR index by the API2-BCI7 indexes;®”

- Calculating Royalties and GIC based on the value of coal at the Mine’s
pithead;

- Capping Royalties at 10%;
- Updating the value of the GIC and introducing a formula for indexation.
Prodeco proposed the creation of a committee to analyse these potential

modifications and, in the meantime, the execution of a memorandum of
understanding.°*

Ingeominas’ reaction

A few days thereafter,’ Ingeominas’ Subdirector de Fiscalizacién  y

Ordenamiento Minero, Mr. Edward Franco, prepared an extensive legal and
economic report, analysing Prodeco’s proposal. The report was delivered to
Mr. Ballesteros, for submission to Ingeominas’ Consejo Directivo.” The main
conclusions were the following: 7°!

- Prodeco had agreed to execute the Mining Contract, and its subsequent
amendments, fully aware of its underlying economic conditions;

- The economic conditions of the Mining Contract were not discriminatory or
contrary to principles of equity, equality or economic balance;

- Prodeco’s proposal would substantially reduce the State’s revenues and
would thus be contrary to Colombia’s interests.

Mr. Franco’s proposal to the Consejo Directivo was the following:””

“En cuanto a la modificacién propuesta se recomienda no acceder a la misma
por ser poco favorable para los intereses de la Nacién”.

Despite this unfavourable initial analysis, the negotiations did not break off and
Prodeco and Ingeominas held further meetings to discuss the changes proposed by
Prodeco.7°3

Prodeco’s second approach

On 15 July 2008, Prodeco sent to Ingeominas a second formal request for the
revision of the economic conditions of the Mining Contract and the reduction of
Royalties and GIC. This extensive request further developed Prodeco’s original
proposal, adding a new argument. With a new price structure Prodeco would be

able to commit additional investments and increase production:”*

ambas partes, de manera que se asegure un conjunto de contraprestaciones
que al mismo tiempo permitan a Prodeco desarrollar el depésito a su maximo

ial de manera itiva, ast como a la Nacion percibir un mayor
monto de ingresos”. [Emphasis added]

 

Prodeco submitted a precise calculation of two scenarios — one if the Mining
Contract was not amended, and the other if Prodeco’s proposals were accepted:

- Under the first scenario, based on the 2006 PTI, the Mine’s total production

would be 117.5 MT, with a maximum annual production of 10 MTA; Royalties
and taxes flowing to Colombia would be just USD 1.9 Bn;

- The second scenario would result in a lifetime production of 225.1 MT and a

maximum annual production of 15.5 MTA; in this case the Royalties and taxes
collected by the Republic would be much higher: USD 5.4 Bn.”

In essence, Prodeco was proposing to Ingeominas a win-win alternative: if
Ingeominas would agree to a reduction of its Royalties, Prodeco would commit to
making additional investments, production of the Mine would increase, costs would
be slashed, sales would be higher, and at the end of the lifecycle Prodeco would
have earned higher profits and Colombia would have received significantly higher
Royalties and taxes.

The Dispute over the Definitive Price

In the same letter Prodeco also raised for the first time an interpretative issue
regarding the definition of the Definitive Price provision in the Seventh
Amendment to the Mining Contract.”

Prodeco acknowledged that there were two possible interpretations of the term

“Definitive Prices”:7””

- The first interpretation would equal “Definitive Price” with the actual sale
price received by Prodeco, evidenced in the invoices issued to the buyers;

- The second interpretation would define “Definitive Price” as the higher of (i)
the FOB Price in the week when the coal was shipped and (ii) the actual sale
price obtained by Prodeco.

Prodeco recognised that, until then, it had calculated the Definitive Price based on
the second alternative; but Prodeco now submitted that this interpretation failed to
consider that the market situation had drastically changed. Prodeco proposed that
the Mining Contract be modified, so that after the amendment, Royalties and GIC
be adjusted based on Prodeco’s actual sale price.7°

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Prodeco unilaterally construes the Mining Contract

On 8 September 2008, Prodeco sent a letter to Ingeominas, stating that as of
30 September 2008 it would calculate Royalties and GIC using a Definitive Price
equal to that paid by the end consumer.’

At the end of September Prodeco did as it had anticipated: it paid the adjustment
amount corresponding to the Royalties and GIC of the third quarter of 2008,
applying the new interpretation of Definitive Prices. This led to an underpayment
of USD 6 M in favour of Prodeco.

This behaviour did not please Ingeominas. On 17 October 2008, Ingeominas
enjoined Prodeco to comply with the terms of the Mining Contract.’!° Prodeco
reacted ten days later, stating that it was aware that any modification of the Mining
Contract had to be bilaterally agreed, but that it no longer required an amendment
to the Definitive Price clause, given that its meaning was clear.”!!

B. The Negotiations

On 23 January 2009, Ingeominas formally put Prodeco on notice through a
Requerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad. Ingeominas considered that Prodeco’s
unilateral interpretation of the Mining Contract amounted to a contractual breach.
Ingeominas notified Prodeco that if payment was not made or appropriate
justification provided within one month, the Contract would be terminated through
a unilateral declaration of caducidad.”'

The negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas continued, and on 21 May 2009,
both parties finally executed a Commitment to Negotiate, in an effort to solve their
dispute. Pursuant to the Commitment to Negotiate:’°

- Prodeco accepted to pay to Ingeominas an additional amount of USD 6.3 M
as Royalties and GIC accrued during the third quarter of 2008, accepting
(albeit under protest) Ingeominas’ interpretation of the Definitive Price term
used in the Mining Contract;

- Prodeco agreed to continue paying Royalties and GIC based on Ingeominas’
interpretation of the Definitive Price provision, until a final agreement was
reached between the parties;

- Both parties undertook to negotiate for a period of 90 days (subject to extension),
trying to solve the Definitive Price dispute and any other economic issues
affecting the Mining Contract raised by Prodeco; should these negotiations fail,

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Ingeominas and Prodeco agreed to resort to amiable composition, and,
alternatively, to domestic Colombian arbitration.

On 3 June 2009, Prodeco made the agreed payment of more than USD 6 M, and
consequently the 90-day negotiation period started to run.7!* The negotiation period
was extended three times, in September, October, and November 2009, before
finally expiring on 9 December 2009.7!°

a. Kick-off Meeting

Ingeominas scheduled a kick-off meeting for 12 June 2009, and sent a letter to
Prodeco in preparation of that meeting.’'® The letter started with a request that
Prodeco submit its proposal, with the economic and legal arguments supporting
it:7

“Para ello y en razon a la importancia que para INGEOMINAS tiene, como
ya indicamos, conocer claramente la posicién del contratista, (mdxime
cuando por la reciente vinculacién de algunos directivos y asesores, estos no
conocen antecedente alguno del proceso) especificamente lo propuesto para
la revisién de las contraprestaciones, se_hace_necesario_adelantar_una
primera reuni6n en la que el contratista exponga dicha posicién, con los
argumentos econémicos y juridicos que la sustentan”. [Emphasis added]

Ingeominas then added a highly relevant condition: Ingeominas must defend “the
interests of the Nation, and it would do so evaluating “the net present value”
associated with the project in its integrity:”!*

“Como ustedes bien saben, INGEOMINAS tiene que evaluar en forma integral
su relacion con el contratista y examinar toda propuesta que reciba conforme
resulte mds conveniente a los intereses de la Nacion, didos estos en
términos econémicos y de valor presente neto, con estricta sujecién a las
normas legales aplicables, razén por la cual solicitamos respetuosamente
considerar esos dicic i al de presentar su propuesta”.
[Emphasis added]

772. The kick-off meeting took place on 12 June 2009. Prodeco submitted an extensive

PowerPoint presentation explaining its position.’!? Claimants proposed to replace
the existing Compensation Scheme (Royalties and GIC) with a single flat royalty
rate based on Prodeco’s actual sale prices. According to Prodeco, this modification

would ultimately generate higher revenues for the State, without impairing the NPV
of the project for Claimants. ’”°

Ingeominas’ response came on 23 June 2009, requesting that Prodeco provide a
numerical, detailed, and concrete proposal of the requested changes to the
Compensation Scheme, and the analyses, valuations, and commitments with respect
to future investments, expansion and production:7?!

“Tal como entonces tuvimos oportunidad de sefialar a ustedes, INGEOMINAS

forma numérica, detallada y concreta, tanto la propuesta que el c is

formula a la Nacién, como los andlisis valoraciones y compromisos

b. The Meeting of 2 July 2009

Prodeco presented its proposal at the meeting scheduled for 2 July 2009.7” In a
PowerPoint presentation,’”> Prodeco proposed a single compensation payment of
10% based on the higher of:

- the actual coal sales price, and
- USD 42.43 per tonne (which was the base price of the 2006 PTI).

According to Prodeco, the proposal, by guaranteeing a minimum price per tonne,
shielded Ingeominas from the risk of potential decreases in coal prices. In a letter
sent two days thereafter, Prodeco again represented to Ingeominas that the proposal
would permit a further expansion of the Mine and would also be advantageous for
Ingeominas and for the Nation:7*+

“La propuesta ida en la pres ién adjunta ademds de representar
un ingreso mayor para Ingeominas y para los departamentos y municipios
que reciben regalias y contraprestaciones, representa un ingreso mayor para
la Naci6n ya que la expansién de la mina permitird incrementar: (i) el ntimero
de empleos directos e indirectos en la mina, (ii) la contribucion al desarrollo
regional, (iii) el rubro de exportaciones, (iv) el valor del capital invertido en
la mina y en consecuencia, la inversion extranjera directa, (v) el monto de los
impuestos a pagar, y (vi) la contribucién al crecimiento del Producto Interno
Bruto”. [Emphasis added]

On 13 July 2009, Ingeominas acknowledged receipt and declared that it was
evaluating Prodeco’s proposal “bajo la salva guarda [sic]de los intereses de la

Nacion y por ende de todos los Colombianos” .”°

ce. The Meeting of 31 July 2009

The next meeting took place on 31 July 2009.””* In his witness statement, Mr. Nagle
records his recollection of the topics which were discussed: Ingeominas had in the
meantime analysed the proposal submitted by Prodeco, and suggested a single
royalty rate of 13%, with the possibility of increasing it to 15% if prices rose and
Prodeco made windfall profits. 7?’

Since Mr. Nagle’s “main takeaway” from the meeting was that Ingeominas
expected an improved offer, Prodeco submitted a revised proposal on 10 August
2009. Prodeco now proposed:7”

- As to the Compensation Scheme, a single compensation rate of 13% (instead
of 10% as originally proposed), calculated on the pithead coal prices, and a
scaled increase in the single compensation rate up to 15% in the event of
extraordinarily high prices, exceeding USD 107 per tonne FOB;

- That the Coal Reference Price be determined monthly by a formula based on
the API2-BC17 indexes, using certain time lags.

d. Communications Between Ingeominas and Prodeco

On 27 August 2009, Ingeominas replied to Prodeco’s revised proposal. Ingeominas
explained that it had not stated its official position yet, and made the following
clarifications:”°

- It considered it to be possible, but had not accepted, to replace the existing
Compensation Scheme with a unified payment; this unified payment could
not be lower than 15% of the FOB price of coal;

- Any amendment to the Compensation Scheme should generate higher yields
for Colombia;

- It did not oppose using a minimum Coal Reference Price to calculate
royalties, but the USD 42.43 price proposed by Prodeco was too low;

- It found that the price reported by the producer as the final price in its invoices
was not always reliable;

- It was necessary to incorporate an internationally recognized coal price index,
with certain time lags.

Ingeominas explained that its officials were assessing Prodeco’s revised proposal
and hoped to come back with a response at the following meeting.”*°

Prodeco answered on 1 September 2009, explaining that its improved offer was
simply aimed at reflecting the parties’ latest discussions. Prodeco declared that it
was open to discuss Ingeominas’ proposals at the following meeting, which should
also address the fact that the Commitment to Negotiate was about to expire. *!

As foreseen by Prodeco, the 90-day agreed period for negotiations expired, and on
3 September 2009, Ingeominas officially notified Prodeco that it would resort to
mediation, as envisaged in the Commitment to Negotiate.”*? But on that same day
Prodeco and Ingeominas reached an agreement to extend the negotiation period
until 30 October 2009, and no mediation was initiated.”**

Ingeominas’ letter of 23 September 2009

On 23 September 2009, Ingeominas responded, after analysing Prodeco’s last
proposal. Ingeominas’ initial reaction was negative: ’**

“[...] de manera respetuosa nos permitimos precisarles que no se encontraron
razones_de_indole_juridica, técnica_o_financiera que las

modificaciones contractuales solicitadas”. [Emphasis added]

But Ingeominas did not completely close the door: if Prodeco submitted clear
evidence of the fact that expansion was impracticable under the existing
Compensation Scheme, Ingeominas would be willing to review Prodeco’s
proposal:7°>

[Emphasis added]

Prodeco’s reply on 30 September 2009

Prodeco replied on 30 September 2009, asking Ingeominas to indicate which
specific data were missing or had not been presented by Prodeco, since Prodeco
could not find any request for information made by Ingeominas to which Prodeco
had not timely answered. Prodeco further cited all the communications and
documents which, in its view, demonstrated that an expansion was unviable.7°°

e. The Meeting of 5 October 2009

Ingeominas and Prodeco held a further meeting on 5 October 2009,”*” and a few
days thereafter, on 9 October, Prodeco submitted a new letter, with additional
explanations. ”*

Prodeco started by justifying its view why, under the existing Compensation
Scheme, it was not economically feasible to expand the Mine, in terms of NPV.
Applying the present system, the maximum NPV was achieved at 8 MTA, and for
higher production the NPV started to decrease as a result of the progressive
Compensation Scheme agreed upon in the Mining Contract:”°

“Por tanto, a partir de dicho punto el valor presente neto del proyecto se
reduce, motivo por el cual es claro que ningtin inversionista arriesgaria su
capital para que disminuya el valor de su inversion. En tales dicic un
proyecto le ‘a deja de ser viable smice ”?, [Emphasis added]

 

Prodeco thus averred that beyond 8 MTA it would be uneconomical to further
increase the capacity of the Mine, and provided the following graph:7“°

In accordance with the graph, with the existing Compensation Scheme:

- Prodeco would reach the maximum NPV of the project with an annual
production of 8 MTA, and consequently had no interest in making additional
investments to increase capacity;

- Assuming this annual production, the income generated in favour of
Ingeominas, in NPV at a 12% discount rate, would amount only to USD 360
M."!

In the letter, Prodeco then submitted its alternative proposal, which it said had been
discussed in the meeting with Ingeominas held on 5 October.

Under this proposal, the present Compensation Scheme would be retained for
production rates up to 8 MTA; but for higher production rates a unified
compensation rate of 13% would be applied.

In that case an annual production of 15 MTA would become economical, even if
the increase in production required a capital investment of USD 1.6 Bn. Prodeco
would be prepared to assume such investment, since the NPV of the project
increased to slightly more than USD 200 M. Ingeominas would also benefit in
Prodeco’s view: the NPV of its take would increase to USD 600 M (again at a 12%
discount rate).”4

Analysis by Ingeominas

Ingeominas asked two of its officers — Mr. Balcero and Ms. Gémez — to analyse
Prodeco’s latest proposal.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Mr. Balcero and Ms. Gomez prepared a three-page memorandum, dated 20 October
2009, which reached the following conclusions: "43

- NPV was a proper financial tool to evaluate long term investment projects; if
the NPV was higher than the required investment, the investment was
feasible;

- The model submitted by Prodeco had a positive NPV for annual production
between 8 and 15 MTA and consequently a project foreseeing production in
that range would be financially viable;

- Certain aspects of Prodeco’s model required further clarification;

- Prodeco should submit a sensitivity analysis to confirm the financial viability
of the project.

The report did not address Prodeco’s argument that the NPV of the project was
maximized at a production of 8 MTA, and that for higher production (which require
greater investment) the NPV decreased — and that for Prodeco the best alternative,
with the existing Compensation Scheme, was to limit production at 8 MTA.

f. The Meeting of 26 October 2009

On 26 October 2009, Ms. Gémez met with Mr. Johnny Campo of Prodeco to discuss
her report.

On that same day, Mr. Campo sent to Mr. Balcero of Ingeominas the sensitivity
analysis,’* reflecting the impact of the variation of certain factors on the NPV of
the project at different production levels,’** namely:

- The impact of the variation of the discount rate on the NPV of the Project at
different production levels:

illustrating the impact of an expansion of the project on its NPV, where the blue

line represents the incremental NPV:747

g.  Prodeco’s Proposal of 4 November 2009

On 4 November 2009, Prodeco presented yet another revised proposal to
Ingeominas, based on the information and projections reviewed jointly by
Ingeominas and Prodeco: "48

(i) Prodeco suggested applying the existing Compensation Scheme for production
up to 8 MTA, with a few modifications:

- The Coal Reference Price for liquidating Royalties and GIC would be the
actual sales prices, instead of a reference index price;

- GIC would apply when production costs were less than 75% of the sales price;
the threshold for GIC payments would be updated annually based on national
and international indexes.

(ii) For production in excess of 8 MTA, the first 8 MTA would be remunerated in
accordance with the Compensation Scheme described in (i), and the excess would
be subject to:

- A flat royalty rate of 5% based on the pithead price, which would apply to
production levels between 8 to 11 MTA;

- If production exceeded 11 MTA, a flat royalty rate of 10% based on the
pithead price would apply to production above 8 MTA;

- The pithead price would be calculated as the final sales price to the consumer
less transport and shipment.

On 11 November 2009, Prodeco submitted two proposed formulae to calculate the
GIC payments. Prodeco also drew Ingeominas’ attention to the fact that it had been
almost six months since the execution of the Commitment to Negotiate, and that
despite Prodeco’s several proposals, Ingeominas had not yet presented any
counter-proposals.”°

h. The Meeting of 17 November 2009

Prodeco and Ingeominas met again on 17 November 2009 and Ingeominas provided
Prodeco with some feedback:”°°

- Ingeominas recognized the need to update the GIC threshold;

- But insisted on using the ICR index as the Coal Reference Price to calculate
Royalties and GIC — a point which Prodeco accepted;

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

- Proposed that a flat 12.6% royalty rate apply to all production when
production exceeded 8 MTA.

Further analyses

On 25 November 2009, Prodeco’s Mr. Campo sent Ingeominas two charts
displaying the impact of Ingeominas’ proposals on NPV.

The first chart showed the impact of a flat 12.6% royalty rate for production
volumes above 8 MTA and GIC thresholds, adjusted by a basket of indexes:7°!

The net take of this proposal is that the maximum NPV of the Mine (lower green
line) is reached with a production of 15 MTA, and that with that production
Ingeominas also maximizes the NPV of its royalties stream (higher green line).
Consequently, this solution seems to offer a win-win scenario.

The second chart referred to an “11/23 rumor proposal,” where above 8 MTA the
Additional Royalty would accrue, but not GIC. In that scenario, the maximum NPV
of the Mine was reached at 8 MTA, a production which does not maximize
Ingeominas’ income stream (which peaks at 15 MTA):

i. The Meeting of 3 December 2009

On 27 November 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed a third, and last,
extension of the Commitment to Negotiate, until 9 December 2009.75?

Thereafter, the negotiations continued at a meeting held on 3 December 2009.7°

In the course of that meeting, agreement seemed within reach. Prodeco accepted

Ingeominas’ proposals: ”**

- A 12.6% flat royalty rate would apply on all production in excess of 8 MTA;

- The ICR reference prices should be weighted to determine a Coal Reference
Price to calculate Royalties and GIC;

- The GIC tables should be indexed to the Colombian consumer price index and
not international indexes;

- Prodeco’s proposal that GIC payments be due only where production costs
exceed 75% of sales prices was rejected.

C. Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment

On 9 December 2009, representatives of Prodeco and Ingeominas met and executed
the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment. Prodeco and Ingeominas initialled
and signed three copies of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.’

Mr. Ballesteros requested that Prodeco leave its signed copy with Ingeominas,
stating that, as a courtesy, he wished to explain the contents of the agreement at the
Consejo Directivo meeting scheduled for the following day. Prodeco acceded to his
request. ”>7

Ingeominas denies registration

On 18 January 2010, Ingeominas returned to Prodeco a signed copy of the Initial
Version of the Eighth Amendment, with multiple stamps stating: 7°

“SIN VIGENCIA POR FALTA DE INSCRIPCION EN EL REGISTRO
MINERO NACIONAL AL CONSIDERARSE LESIVO PARA EL ESTADO”.

In the cover letter, Ingeominas explained that the Initial Version of the Eighth
Amendment was contrary to the interests of the Nation and that registration at the
Mining Registry had been denied:’°°

“[...] me permito indicarle que con el presente oficio estamos adjuntando
copia del Otrosi No 8 al Contrato de Gran Mineria No 044/89 de fecha 9 de
diciembre de 2008, sin la cor di inscripcion en el Registro Minero

The agency explained its decision with the following words:

“Finalmente, es pertinente indicar que la decisién adoptada obedece a las
politicas y directrices institucionales, encaminadas a garantizar la adecuada
administracién del recurso minero y la debida ejecucién de las condiciones
econémicas pactadas en el contrato de concesion respectivo, en pro de los
intereses de la Naci6n, siendo estos iiltimos los tinicos que pueden orientar la
actividad de quienes prestan sus servicios a INGEOMINAS”.

Finally, Ingeominas invited Prodeco to an immediate and joint review of the
pending aspects of the negotiations. ’°!

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Ingeominas suggested minor adjustments to the royalty scheme, namely,
maintaining the existing Royalty rate up to 8 MTA (i.e., a maximum flat 12.6% rate
at 8 MTA), but that each additional MTA be subject to an additional 1% rate (i.e.,
the 9" MTA only would be subject to a 13.6% royalty rate, the 10" MTA only to a
14.6% royalty rate, and so on).’°?

Prodeco acquiesced to Ingeominas’ proposed modifications.”

Hence, four days later, on 22 January 2010, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the
final version of the Eighth Amendment,’ which was registered with the National
Mining Registry three days later.

(4.2) DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Pursuant to Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty, protection applies only to investments
made in accordance with Colombia’s laws and regulations,’® and Colombian law
requires that contracts be negotiated and performed in good faith.” This municipal
law principle is echoed at the international law level. The principle was stated in
Inceysa tribunal, and has been reiterated by other tribunals thereafter: ’°”

“La buena fe es un principio supremo al que estdn_sujetas las relaciones
juridicas en todos sus aspectos y contenido. [...] En el dmbito contractual, la
buena fe se manifiesta como la ausencia de engafios y artificios durante el
proceso de negociacién y otorgamiento de los actos que dieron origen a la
inversion, asi como Ia lealtad, la verdad y el dnimo de mantener el equilibrio
en las prestaciones reciprocas de las partes”. [Emphasis added]

 

Respondent submits that Claimants secured their investment through bad faith and
deceit in three ways:7°

- First, as of February 2009 (i.e. before the negotiations had commenced),
Claimants were already planning to increase production beyond 8 MTA without
any change in the Royalty regime (A.);

- Second, Claimants misrepresented the economic situation of the project in order
to persuade Ingeominas that expanding production beyond 8 MTA was not
economically feasible under the then-applicable terms of the Mining
Contract (B.);

- Third, Claimants deliberately concealed information from Ingeominas, namely
geological, technical, and accurate pricing information, thus rendering
Ingeominas unable to properly assess Prodeco’s economic proposals (C.).

A.  Pre-Existing Plans

Respondent argues that:’°

“[...] as of February 2009 (i.e., before the Negotiations had commenced
Claimants were already planning to increase production beyond 8 MTA/108
MT without any change in the royalty regime.” [Emphasis added]

As evidence, Respondent refers to a Circular published on 2 February 2009 by
Xstrata (an international mining company) to its shareholders, in the course of a
failed sale of Prodeco from Glencore to Xstrata, which reads as follows:””°

“An expansion of production of export thermal coal to 12 Mtpa is planned to
be completed by 2013 [in Calenturitas]. However, work is still being
completed to understand the maximum annual production achievable within
the current lease area. This may increase production to approximately 14
Mtpa.”

The Tribunal’s analysis

The weakness of Respondent’s argument is that its basic premise is false:
Respondent avers that February 2009 was before the “Negotiations had
commenced.”

 

In fact, those negotiations had commenced eight months before, in the middle of
2008 (see Section V.1.(4.1).A. supra).

The evidence does not prove quod demonstrandum erat.

B. Allegations of Misrepresentation

Respondent also says that Claimants misrepresented the economics of the
Calenturitas Mine, in order to induce Ingeominas to execute the Eighth
Amendment.””!

Respondent argues that Prodeco’s presentations to Ingeominas relied on unduly low
coal prices and mine costs, and on unduly high discount rates, misleading
Ingeominas into believing that the 8 MTA scenario resulted in the highest NPV to
Prodeco.”””

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Colombia specifically refers to Doc. C-103, a document which Prodeco sent to
Ingeominas on 26 October 2009.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

On 26 October 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas had held a meeting in the morning.
As a follow-up, in the afternoon Prodeco’s Mr. Campo sent to Ingeominas’ Mr.
Balcero Doc. C-103, which contained certain sensitivity analyses. In the cover
email, Mr. Campo offered to meet with Mr. Balcero on the following day, “para
revisarlo rdpidamente y responder [a] las inquietudes que tengas”’.

Mr. Campo’s offer does not indicate any intention of hiding facts or presenting
deceitful information — quite the contrary.

(i) Respondent’s first argument that Prodeco acted in bad faith is based on the
assertion that the coal price range used in Prodeco’s sensitivity analysis was
USD 40 to 60 per tonne, and thus too low.”

The argument does not stand up to scrutiny.

Ingeominas, Colombia’s mining agency, could never be deceived by a mining
company submitting an incorrect price range for coal prices. Ingeominas has ample
information of appropriate price ranges to be applied in NPV valuations of coal
mines — its team of experts was continuously reviewing mining PTIs submitted by
various mining companies, which included (as one of their main factors) the price
range for coal.

In any case, the 2010 PTI, which was approved by Ingeominas, used a price of
USD 55 per tonne —”” and was thus within the same range proposed by Prodeco in
2009, proving that this range was not fabricated by Prodeco.

(ii) Respondent’s second argument is that Claimants’ mine costs assumption under
the 8 MTA scenario were unduly low, as compared to the cost assumptions used for
higher production scenarios.’”°

This is a highly technical argument, based on the stripping ratios and truck use
factors for three types of trucks used in the 6 MTA, 8 MTA, 9 MTA, and 10 MTA
scenarios, and supported by an ex post report prepared by Brattle.””°

Claimants disagree and say that there is no justification: the strip ratios were directly
carried over from the internal mine sequence —’”” an averment not contradicted by
Respondent.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

All in all, the Tribunal sees no element of bad faith, simply a disagreement by
Respondent’s expert as to whether the truck utilization rate used in Claimants’
sensitivity analysis was correct — a rate which Claimants also used in their own
internal mine sequence.

(iii) Respondent finally says that Claimants overstated the appropriate discount rate
to calculate the NPV of various scenarios.””*

The argument is baseless.

Claimants included in their sensitivities for each of the production scenarios
discount rates of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15%.7””

If Ingeominas thought that any other discount rates would be appropriate, it could
without doubt have made the calculation itself, or accept Mr. Campo’s offer to
provide additional information.

C. Allegations of Withholding of Information

Respondent further avers that Claimants withheld material information from
Ingeominas.’°°

Respondent’s argument is based on a so-called “Alternative Expansion Scenario”,
which was created by Respondent’s expert, Brattle, pursuant to which Claimants
could have expanded the total mine production beyond 8 MTA, even under the
existing Royalty scheme, by producing 10 MTA and thus exhausting the reserve
base within the term of the concession (i.e., by 2035).’8! According to
Respondent:7®?

“The principal advantage of the Alternative Expansion Scenario is that it
would have yielded — under the pre-Eighth Amendment regime — (i) a higher
NPV to Prodeco than that of the 8 MTA/108 MT scenario, and (ii) a higher
NPV to Colombia than Claimants’ 15 MTA/245 MT proposal.”

Respondent says that, although Prodeco was certainly aware that it did not need the
Eighth Amendment in order to increase production, it deliberately omitted to

discuss the Alternative Expansion Scenario with Ingeominas. ’*?

Claimants aver that Respondent’s argument is a non sequitur."*+

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

The Tribunal’s analysis
The Tribunal agrees with Claimants.

The so-called “Alternative Expansion Scenario” did not exist at the time of the
negotiation of the Eighth Amendment. It is a scenario created by Brattle, ex post,
for the purposes of the present arbitration. There is no evidence that Claimants ever
developed such a scenario, or that Ingeominas, Colombia’s mining agency, staffed
with well-prepared civil servants, ever raised such possibility.

aK

Summing up, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent’s allegation that
Claimants secured their investment through bad faith and deceit.

The evidence on the record does not support Respondent’s proposition that Prodeco
deliberately misrepresented the economic situation of the Project or tried to conceal
information from Ingeominas.’*°

The Tribunal is persuaded that Prodeco and Ingeominas negotiated the Eighth
Amendment extensively, in good faith, and at arm’s length. The negotiations, which
involved two entities with ample experience in the coal sector, were held for a
period of over 20 months, during which there were multiple meetings and
exchanges of proposals. Throughout the negotiations, Ingeominas had every
opportunity to request information and to question the information provided by
Prodeco. There is no evidence that Prodeco failed to address any request submitted
by Ingeominas.

The Tribunal is reassured in its conclusions by two facts:

- First, up until the present arbitration, Colombia never raised any allegations of

bad faith or deceit in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment against Prodeco;
in particular, in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, the ANM never
questioned Prodeco’s conduct throughout the negotiations of the Eighth
Amendment;

- Second, Prodeco’s behaviour in the negotiations actually denotes good faith.

Indeed, in December 2009 Prodeco and Ingeominas signed an Initial Version of
the Eighth Amendment, from which Ingeominas eventually backtracked;
Prodeco could have tried to enforce the Initial Version of the Eighth
Amendment, which had been duly executed by Ingeominas; instead, Prodeco
accepted to renegotiate, so that Ingeominas could be satisfied that the final
version of the Eighth Amendment was favourable to the interests of the
Colombian State. Prodeco’s conduct is telling and contradicts Respondent’s
criticisms.

The negative inference requested by Respondent in R II para. 999 is totally without merit. There is no

evidence that Claimants’ withheld documents relating to the negotiations between Ingeominas and Prodeco.

(5) SUMMARY OF THE DECISIONS

859. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to prove its accusations
that Prodeco acquired the 3ha Contract as a means to bribe Mr. Ballesteros into
executing the Eighth Amendment or that it misrepresented the economic situation
of the project and deliberately and in bad faith withheld material information from
Ingeominas in order to secure the Eighth Amendment.

860. Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s Illegality Objection.

V.2. FORK IN THE ROAD OBJECTION

Respondent argues that the fork-in-the-road clause of the Treaty [the “FIR
Clause”] deprives the Centre of jurisdiction and the Tribunal of competence over
the “Claim against the Contraloria’, since Claimants chose local courts to solve the
underlying dispute (1).’°°

Claimants argue that Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the elements for the
application of the FIR Clause are satisfied, and that Colombia seeks unduly to
expand the scope of application of this provision (2).7°”

After summarizing the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal will analyse the issues and
explain its decision (3).

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Respondent points out that Art. 11(4) of the Treaty contains an FIR Clause, which
determines that once an investor has made the choice to submit a dispute to local
courts or to international arbitration, that choice is final.7°8

According to Respondent, in the present case Prodeco chose to submit a claim
against the Contraloria’s Decision to the Colombian administrative courts before it
submitted such claim to arbitration. Therefore, this Tribunal has no competence
over the claim against the Contraloria.’°°

The Request for Conciliation triggered the fork in the road

Respondent argues that Prodeco started local administrative proceedings against the
Contraloria’s Decision by filing, on 30 December 2015, a request with the
Procuraduria General de la Nacion to start extrajudicial conciliation proceedings
[already defined as the “Request for Conciliation”].”° Respondent explains that
under Colombian law, conciliation is a mandatory pre-condition to litigation,””! and
that the action before the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca could not have
been validly commenced without this pre-litigation stage.’

The Request for Conciliation was filed over two months prior to the referral of the
same claim to arbitration, on 4 March 2016. Claimants thus chose local courts prior
to choosing arbitration.” Respondent avers that the Request for Conciliation

suffices for the purposes of triggering the FIR Clause, which requires only that the
proceedings be “referred” to domestic courts or to arbitration.”

868.

oo

Respondent also submits that it is irrelevant that the conciliation would be
extra-judicial in nature, since the Treaty does not exclude this type of proceedings
from the FIR Clause.”>

The Tribunal must apply the fundamental basis test
869.

oS

Respondent argues that the test for a fork-in-the-road clause to apply has been
established by the Pantechniki case, as the “fundamental basis” test: the Tribunal
must assess whether the claim before the local courts and the arbitration claim share
the same fundamental basis, and thus cannot be tolerated to run in parallel.”

870.

S

According to Respondent, the claim submitted by Claimants against the
Contraloria in the present arbitration shares the same fundamental basis as the
claim filed by Prodeco before the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca:""

 

- The claim presented by Claimants against the Contraloria in the present
arbitration and the challenge levied by Prodeco against the Contraloria’s
Decision arise out of the same factual matrix: the imposition of the Fiscal
Liability Amount on Prodeco; this is evident from the comparison of the
arguments presented, on the one hand, by Claimants in the Statement of Claim
and, on the other, by Prodeco in the Request for Conciliation;

- The relief sought is the same in both proceedings and both claims seek the same
effect: to wipe out the Contraloria’s Decision and to return the Fiscal Liability
Amount to Claimants;

- Claimants use the same legal terminology to articulate their claims in this
arbitration and in the proceedings before the Tribunal Administrativo de
Cundinamarca;

- Because Glencore indirectly holds 100% of Prodeco’s shares and effectively
controls Prodeco, one must consider that the claim filed by Prodeco before the
Tribunal Administrativo was in fact filed by Glencore.

871.

Respondent argues that since the claim before the Colombian administrative
jurisdiction predates the claim against the Contraloria in the present arbitration and
both claims share the same fundamental basis, the Tribunal’s competence is barred
by the FIR Clause.7"*

Claimants’ counter-arguments are baseless

As to the counter-arguments raised by Claimants, Respondent submits that the
“triple identity” test has fallen in disfavour regarding fork-in-the-road clauses.

First, Respondent argues that the Treaty and recent case-law do not require the strict
identity of parties in order for the FIR Clause to be triggered.””

Respondent submits that the Treaty contains no language that could justify a
requirement of strict identity of the parties. Fork-in-the-road clauses are aimed at
preventing the same issue from being adjudicated twice, by different fora, and the
same party from having to defend itself in multiple proceedings. Respondent argues
that, in order to be effective, fork-in-the-road clauses must cover non-identical
parties; requiring a strict identity of parties would open the door to multiple
companies, forming part of the same corporate structure, bringing parallel claims
against the same sovereign State.°°

Respondent further avers that since the Pantechniki award was rendered, recent
case-law has favoured the “fundamental basis” test and discarded the requirement
of strict identity of the parties.*°! According to Respondent, a consistent line of
cases, such as the Ampal, Grynberg, and Apotex cases, stands for the proposition
that the party’s identity requirement must be applied flexibly, and that it is satisfied
as between parties in the same corporate ownership chain. In particular, the Ampal
tribunal found that the doctrine of res judicata was applicable “to the parties to the
prior award and to those persons who are in privity of interest with them”.*°

Second, Respondent submits that neither the Treaty nor recent case-law require a
strict identity of dispute for the fork-in-the-road clause to be triggered.*°? Again,
the “fundamental basis” standard of the Pantechniki award has gained increasing
traction.

Respondent says that in the Salini Impregilo case, the tribunal found it sufficient
“that the substantive underpinnings of the dispute have been ‘submitted to the
competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction’”.*°> Similarly, the Philip Morris
case established that the term “dispute” should be understood broadly, and that it
was sufficient for both disputes to be grounded on substantially similar facts and to
related investments under the treaty.®°°

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Respondent argues that Claimants only rely on case-law which pre-dates the
Pantechniki award to support their claim that the majority of tribunals have adopted
the “triple identity” test when interpreting fork-in-the-road provisions.*””

Third, Respondent rejects Claimants’ argument that the proceedings before the
Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca would be a defensive action, and that
the operation of the FIR Clause would somehow be barred. Claimants chose to
impugn the Contraloria’s Decision before local courts and should not be permitted
to pursue the same claim before this Tribunal. In any event, neither the Treaty nor
case law exclude the application of the FIR Clause on the basis of the purported
defensive nature of domestic litigation.°°*

Finally, Respondent denies that it is estopped from bringing an objection under the
FIR Clause. The fact that in the Colombian court proceedings the Contraloria
argued that Glencore had opted for international arbitration, and that this choice
excludes the jurisdiction of the Colombian administrative courts, is irrelevant. Such
statement was only made during the mandatory conciliation proceedings, and not
before the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca. In addition, there is no
evidence that Claimants relied on the Contraloria’s statement, nor that such reliance
would have prejudiced them.°”

CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

According to Claimants, for the FIR Clause of Art. 11(4) of the Treaty to apply,
several cumulative conditions must be met:*!°

- The “investor”, who must be the same investor that brought the international
claim,

- Must have “referred the dispute”, as defined in Art. 11(4) of the Treaty —i.e.a
Treaty dispute,

- Toa “national tribunal”,
- Before referring it to international arbitration.

According to Claimants, Colombia cannot demonstrate that a single one of these
elements is satisfied.*"!

Identity of investor

the strict identity of the investor who has referred the dispute to local courts and to
international arbitration.

In the present arbitration, there are two “investors” in the sense of Art. 11(4) of the
Treaty: Glencore and Prodeco. Glencore and Prodeco are separate legal entities and
Glencore is not a party to any domestic court proceedings or conciliation in
Colombia. Even if Colombia were able to establish that Prodeco referred the same
dispute to a national court, quod non, Colombia cannot invoke the objection against
Glencore.*!?

Claimants submit that, in any event, the case law invoked by Respondent does not
support its argument:°!3

- Inthe Pantechniki and the H&H v. Egypt cases, the same investor had brought

both the domestic and the arbitration proceedings; the tribunals simply found
that the identity of the counter-party — the respondent, i.e. the State and its
entities — was not required;

- The Supervision y Control decision, in which Colombia’s lead counsel in this

arbitration acted as arbitrator, does not conclude that the reference in a treaty to
an investor should be understood to include any controlled entities;

- The Salini Impregilo case does not relate to the application of the fork-in-the-

road clause, but to a “pre-arbitral domestic litigation requirement” that serves a
fundamentally different purpose.

Identity of dispute

According to Claimants, the Tribunal must interpret the text of the Treaty pursuant
to Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [“WCLT”].
Claimants assert that the term “dispute” in Art. 11(4) can only refer to the type of
dispute described in Art. 11(1), i.e. a dispute regarding a violation of the Treaty by
Colombia, which is submitted to two different fora.

Claimants argue that the dispute resolution clause of the Treaty does not cover
domestic disputes, only disputes relating to Treaty breaches, in particular disputes
arising from a party’s view that “a measure applied by the other Party is inconsistent
with an obligation” under the Treaty.*!*

Claimants argue that Prodeco has never submitted a dispute regarding a violation
of the Treaty to the Colombian courts. Prodeco simply started a defensive action in
Colombia, to restore the status quo and to invalidate the Fiscal Liability Amount.*!>

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Claimants contend that the treaty applicable in the Pantechniki case had a
fundamentally different text, which broadly defined the investment dispute subject
to its dispute settlement clause as “any dispute [...] concerning investments”.
Similarly, the Philip Morris case is distinguishable due to the textual differences in
the treaty between Uruguay and Switzerland and the one between Colombia and
Switzerland. Thus, the findings in those cases do not assist Colombia’s
arguments.*!®

Furthermore, Claimants submit that at least five cases decided after the Pantechniki
award adopted the “triple-identity test” when interpreting fork in the road
provisions, including the Charanne and the Khan cases, which rejected the
fundamental basis test.°!”

Irrespective of this, Claimants contend that neither Prodeco’s Request for
Conciliation nor the subsequent challenge of the Contraloria’s Decision before the
Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca concerns a Treaty dispute. Locally,
Prodeco seeks a declaration that the Decision is not valid under Colombian law,
whereas in this proceeding, Claimants seek relief for Colombia’s breaches of the
Treaty, which does not include the nullification of the Contraloria’s Decision as a
matter of Colombian law.*!*

Referral to arbitration preceded the challenge of the Contraloria’s Decision

Claimants argue that they filed the Request for Arbitration on 4 March 2016, and
therefore chose arbitration before submitting a defensive challenge to the
Contraloria’s Decision to the Colombian courts on 31 March 2016.8!

 

According to Claimants, the Contraloria itself acknowledged that the Colombian
courts lacked jurisdiction over Prodeco’s challenge because Prodeco had “opted for
international arbitration to resolve this dispute, [and] ha[d] definitively excluded
the Colombian Administrative Court’s jurisdiction”. The position adopted by
Colombia in the conciliation proceedings precludes Colombia from raising the
contrary objection in the present arbitration.*”°

 

Claimants note that Art. 11(4) expressly requires the referral of the dispute to a
national court. The Request for Conciliation, which is a pre-condition to initiating
court proceedings, was submitted to the Procurador, a non-judicial authority, and
did not entail any court fees.*?!

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Claimants explain that Art. 3 of Law 640 of 2001 states that conciliation is “extra-
judicial” precisely by virtue of being prior to, or outside of, a court procedure.
Similarly, Art. 179 of Law 1437 of 2011 makes clear that the first stage of the
relevant court procedure begins with the submission of the complaint before the
judge, not with compliance of any pre-requisites.*””

Accordingly, there was no need for the Treaty to exclude pre-litigation
conciliation.8°3

In reference to Colombia’s argument that referral to a national tribunal occurs when
the amicable consultation process is initiated, Claimants submit that if that
argument were correct, the same test would have to be accepted for arbitration.
Consequently, Respondent’s objection would still fail, since Claimants delivered
their notice of dispute triggering the amicable consultation process under the Treaty
on 28 August 2015, several months before the Request for Conciliation.***

The Request for Conciliation was a defensive action to restore the status quo

Claimants argue that Prodeco started a claim against the Contraloria’s Decision as
a defensive action under municipal law, seeking to restore the status quo. As this
relief could only be sought in Colombia, Prodeco’s challenge constitutes the type
of defensive action that tribunals in the Genin and Enron cases deemed not to trigger
a fork-in-the-road clause. °°

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Art. 11 of the Treaty, which concerns the settlement of disputes between a State
party to the Treaty and an investor of the other State party, provides that:*°

“(1) If an investor of a Party considers that a measure applied by the other
Party is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus causing loss
or damage to him or his investment, he may request consultations with a view
to resolving the matter amicably.

(2) Any such matter which has not been settled within a period of six months
from the date of written request for consultations may be referred to the courts
or administrative tribunals of the Party concerned or to international
arbitration. [...]

(4) Once the investor has referred the dispute to either a national tribunal or
any of the international arbitration mechanisms provided for in paragraph 2
above, the choice of the procedure shall be final”.

Arts. 11(2) and (4) contain a so-called “fork in the road” provision, which allows
the investor to opt between different judicial or arbitral fora for the submission of

an investment dispute, but prescribes that once that election has been made, it
becomes final and irrevocable — electa una via non datur recursus ad alteram.

Respondent submits that Prodeco chose to refer the dispute against the Contraloria
to the Colombian local courts, and that because of that choice Claimants are barred
from resorting to international arbitration.

The Tribunal will briefly summarise the proven facts (A.) and then analyse and
eventually dismiss Respondent’s Fork in the Road Objection (B.).

A. Proven Facts

a. Contraloria’s Decision and Administrative Recourse

On 30 April 2015, the Contralora Delegada, Ms. Vargas, issued the Contraloria’s
Decision, which found that by executing the Eighth Amendment Prodeco had
incurred liability and held Prodeco and certain civil servants jointly and severally

liable to compensate the State for the damage caused.*?”

On 11 May 2015, Prodeco filed:

  

ibn before the Contralora Delegada, the very authority who
had issued the Decision, asking for reconsideration of her Decision, and

- A recurso de apelacién to the Contralor General de la Repiiblica, the superior

of the Contralora Delegada.***

These administrative appeals proved to be unsuccessful:

- In July 2015, the Contralora Delegada rejected Prodeco’s recurso de

reposicion; 829 and

- In August 2015, the Contralor General issued the Appeal Decision, which

affirmed the Contraloria’s Decision.**°

The Contraloria’s Decision thus became binding (“firme”) at the administrative
level. Under Colombian administrative law, Prodeco could now resort to
challenging the validity of the Contraloria’s final administrative act before the
Colombian administrative courts. Such a challenge required, as a preliminary but
obligatory step, that Prodeco request non-judicial conciliation with the Contraloria;
if the conciliation were to prove unsuccessful, Prodeco would be entitled to file a
judicial proceso de nulidad with the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca
[already defined as the “Annulment Procedure”].

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

b. Notification of the Investment Dispute

907. But Prodeco did not immediately launch a non-judicial conciliation, as a
preliminary step leading to an Annulment Procedure before the Colombian
administrative courts. Claimants’ first reaction was to start consultations with the
Republic under Art. 11(1) of the Treaty — a measure necessary to start a claim for
breach of the BIT.*?!

908. With this purpose in mind, on 28 August 2015, Claimants wrote to the President of
Colombia, Mr. Juan Manuel Santos, formally notifying a dispute under the
Treaty.**? Claimants submitted that certain measures adopted by Colombia,
including the Contraloria’s Decision, had resulted in the Republic breaching its
obligations under Art. 4, 6 and 10(2) of the BIT, which entitled Claimants to
compensation for the damage caused to their investments in Colombia [the
“Investment Dispute”).

909. The 28 August 2015 letter put in motion the mandatory six-month consultation
period required by Art. 11(2) of the Treaty. After this mandatory cooling-off period,
Claimants would be entitled to refer the Investment Dispute either to the Colombian
domestic courts or to international arbitration.

c. Request for Conciliation of the Annulment Dispute

910.

o

While the consultations regarding the Investment Dispute were taking place,
Prodeco decided to carry out a further preliminary measure necessary to file a
judicial Annulment Procedure against the Contraloria’s Decision: a request for
conciliation before an administrative agency, the Procuraduria General de la
Nacién [“Procuraduria”]. As noted, under Colombian law conciliation is a pre-
requisite for launching judicial proceedings against the State.***

911.

Prodeco filed a Request for Conciliation on 30 December 2015,*** and the dispute

to be conciliated was defined as the annulment of an administrative act (the
Contraloria’s Decision) and the subsequent “restablecimiento de derechos”,
including restitution of amounts paid.**>

851 Doc, C-38. Art. 11(1) of the Treaty provides that: “If an investor of a Party considers that a measure
applied by the other Party is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus causing loss or damage
to him or his inves , he may request ions with a view to resolving the matter amicably”
{Emphasis added] (Doc. C-6).

832 Doc. C-38. Claimants also forwarded this letter to several Ministers of the Colombian Government (see
p. 26).

d. Referral of the Investment Dispute to International Arbitration

In the meantime, the consultations with the Republic of Colombia under the BIT
proved unsuccessful, and on 4 March 2016, Claimants exercised the option
conferred by Art. 11(2) of the Treaty and decided to submit the Investment Dispute
to adjudication by international arbitration. They formalized their decision by
submitting a Request for Arbitration to ICSID,**° putting the present arbitration in
motion.

e. Conciliation

Three weeks thereafter, on 28 March 2016, the Procuraduria convened the oral
conciliation meeting [the “Conciliation”] which had been requested by Prodeco in
its Request for Conciliation. The Contraloria, Prodeco, and the other parties to the
Fiscal Liability Proceeding were in attendance.**”

The Contraloria rejected Prodeco’s request for conciliation, arguing that the
Colombian Courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute which Prodeco was
intending to submit, because Glencore and Prodeco had opted to submit such
dispute to ICSID arbitration (pro memoria: Claimants had indeed submitted the
Investment Dispute to ICSID arbitration three weeks before).*°*

f. Annulment Procedure

On 1 April 2016, three days after the unsuccessful Conciliation, Prodeco filed the

Annulment Procedure with the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca*®. The

remedies sought in the judicial claim were analogous to those discussed in the

Conciliation:*”°

- Annulment of the Contraloria’s Decision,

- With the consequent restitution of the amounts already paid by Prodeco in
compliance with the Contraloria’s Decision,

- Certain ancillary requests plus damages.
The reasons invoked by Prodeco in its Annulment Procedure were the following:**!
- The Contraloria had violated Colombian law;

- The Contraloria lacked competence to adopt the Decision;

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

- The Contraloria breached Prodeco’s due process rights;

- The Contraloria’s accusations and imputations against Prodeco are baseless;

- The Decision is poorly reasoned;

- Prodeco cannot be subjected to a fiscal liability procedure;

- The Republic has suffered no damage;

- Prodeco did not incur in dolo;

- There is no causal link between Prodeco’s conduct and the alleged damage;

- The Contraloria has incurred in a misuse of powers (“desviacidn de poder’).
The reasons invoked did not include the allegation that Colombia had breached its
obligations under the Treaty. To the contrary, Prodeco explicitly reserved all its
rights regarding the present ICSID Arbitration. **

A decision by the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca remains pending.

B. Analysis and Decision of the Tribunal

Under Art. 11(1) of the Treaty, an investor which considers that “a measure
applied” by the host State “is inconsistent with an obligation of the Agreement”,
must “request consultations with a view to resolving the matter amicably”.

It is undisputed that on 28 August 2015, Claimants requested such consultations,
by filing a letter addressed to the President of the Republic. The letter stated the
view that certain measures adopted by the Republic, including the Contraloria’s
Decision, had resulted in the Republic breaching its obligations under Art. 4, 6 and

10(2) of the Treaty and that as a consequence thereof an Investment Dispute had
arisen.*4

Art. 11(2) of the Treaty

Art. 11(2) of the Treaty provides that, if the amicable consultation is unsuccessful,
after “a period of six months from the date of the request for consultation” the
investor is afforded an option: it can choose to submit the matter either

- to “the courts or administrative tribunals” of the host State, or

- to “international arbitration”.

In the present case, the Investment Dispute formalized in the 28 August 2015 letter
was not settled within a period of six months, and out of the two options offered by

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Art. 11(2), Claimants selected international arbitration: they did so on 4 March 2016
(i.e. more than six months after the request), by filing a Request for Arbitration with
ICSID, and putting this arbitration in motion.

Art. 11(4) of the Treaty

Art. 11(4) of the Treaty contains the so-called “fork in the road” provision
[previously defined as the “FIR Clause”]: “once the investor has referred the
dispute” either to a national court or tribunal or to international arbitration, “the
choice of the procedure shall be final”.

Respondent’s diverging positions

Respondent, at different times, has held two diverging positions as regards the
option exercised by Claimants under the FIR Clause:

(i) In this arbitration, the Republic argues that, when on 30 December 2015 Prodeco
filed a Request for Conciliation before the Procuraduria, Claimants exercised the
option conferred under Art. 11(2) of the Treaty, and opted to submit the Investment
Dispute (as defined in the 28 August 2015 letter addressed to the President of the
Republic) to the administrative courts of Colombia.

Consequently — adds Colombia — when on 4 March 2016 Claimants filed the
Request for Arbitration with ICSID, they breached the fork-in-the-road provision,
with the implication that the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence
to adjudicate the Investment Dispute, and that such Investment Dispute must be
adjudicated by the Colombian courts.

(ii) On 28 March 2016, however, Colombia held a contrary position.

In the Conciliation meeting which was held on that date, the Republic, acting
through the Contraloria, formally stated that Claimants had opted to submit the
dispute which was being conciliated to ICSID arbitration, and that consequently the
Colombian courts in general, and the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca in
particular, lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate such dispute.

The minutes of the Conciliation meeting clearly state Colombia’s position at that

time, as expressed by the Contraloria:’*

“De manera respetuosa me permito informar que la solicitud de conciliacién
propuesta por CI PRODECO S.A. [...] fue estudiada en la sesién quinta (5“)
del comité de conciliacién, resolviéndose por unanimidad, NO CONCILIAR

The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal does not agree with the position now adopted by Respondent in the
present arbitration.

The reason is straightforward: on 4 March 2016, Claimants exercised their rights
under the FIR Clause of Art. 11(2) of the Treaty and validly opted to submit the
Investment Dispute to international arbitration.

Contrary to Respondent’s (present) argument, the non-judicial Request for
Conciliation, which Prodeco had filed four months before with the Procuraduria,
never constituted the exercise of the option conferred by the FIR Clause: Art. 11(4)
of the Treaty requires, for the fork-in-the-road to apply, that the investor “referred
the dispute” to a “national tribunal”. Prodeco’s Request for (non-judicial)
Conciliation before the Procuraduria, an administrative agency of the Republic,
failed to meet this test for two reasons:

- First, the Treaty requires that the investor “referred the dispute” to a domestic

court or to international arbitration; this implies that the dispute be submitted to
binding adjudication by an independent body, and that the decision of such body
not be subject to consensual validation by the parties; a request for conciliation
does not meet this standard: the request is simply an invitation to the other party,
proposing that a meeting be held and a settlement be negotiated and eventually
agreed upon;

- Second, referral must be to a “national tribunal” [as expressed in Art. 11(4)] or

to “courts or administrative tribunals” [the analogous expression preferred by
Art. 11(2)]; the Procuraduria is neither a court nor a tribunal: it simply is an
administrative agency of the Republic, entrusted (inter alia) with the
organization of prejudicial conciliation procedures.

These conclusions are confirmed by Colombian law.
Colombian Law

Art. 161(1) of the Colombian Code of Administrative Procedure provides as
follows:*45

added, bold in the original]

Under Colombian administrative law, conciliation is a mandatory pre-requisite for
introducing a judicial claim regarding the nullity of an administrative act. As
enshrined in the law, this is an “extrajudicial”, amicable procedure, which is not
filed with any judicial authority, but rather with an administrative agency as the
Procuraduria.*°

This conclusion is confirmed by Art. 3 of Law 640 of 2001, “por la cual se
modifican normas relativas a la conciliacién y se dictan otras disposiciones”,
which provides that:*47

“La conciliacién podré ser judicial si se realiza dentro de un proceso judicial,

o extrajudicial, si se realiza antes o por fuera de un proceso judicial”.
[Emphasis added]

In the present case, the wording of the Request for Conciliation filed by Prodeco
848

further supports its extrajudicial nature:
“Referencia: remisién de la solicitud de Audiencia de Conciliacidn_pre-

Summing up, on 4 March 2016, Claimants, by filing the Request for Arbitration,
properly exercised their rights under the FIR Clause of Art. 11(2) of the Treaty and
validly opted to submit the Investment Dispute to international arbitration. Prior to
that date Claimants had never referred the Investment Dispute to adjudication by
the national courts or tribunals of Colombia and hence the FIR Clause of Art. 11(4)
of the Treaty had never been triggered.

Contrary to Respondent’s arguments, the Request for Conciliation which Prodeco
filed with the Procuraduria in December 2015 was incapable of triggering the FIR

Clause: the Request did not refer any dispute to adjudication by an independent
body, and the Procuraduria in any case does not qualify as “a national tribunal”.

The first time that Prodeco referred any dispute to “a national tribunal” was on
1 April 2016, when Prodeco filed the Annulment Procedure with the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca.*” As this referral occurred three weeks after
Claimants had filed the Request of Arbitration, it could never deprive this Tribunal
of competence to adjudicate the Investment Dispute.

The Tribunal consequently dismisses Respondent’s Fork in the Road Objection. In
light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider and resolve
the issues raised by the Parties related to the identity of parties and the identity of
disputes.

Likewise, it is not for the Tribunal to decide:

- whether for the purposes of the Annulment Procedure, the Annulment
Dispute referred to in the Request for Conciliation and then formalized in the
Annulment Procedure coincides or overlaps with the Investment Dispute
which is being adjudicated in this arbitration; or

- whether, in view of the fork-in-the-road provision of Art. 11(4) of the Treaty,
and the filing of this arbitration, the Tribunal Administrativo de
Cundinamarca has or lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the Annulment
Procedure filed by Prodeco.

These issues, raised by Colombia in the Conciliation, are for the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca, and the Colombian courts in general, to decide.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

V.3. UMBRELLA CLAUSE OBJECTION

Respondent submits that, pursuant to Art. 11(3) of the Treaty, the Tribunal is
precluded from exercising competence over Claimants’ claims grounded on the
Treaty’s “umbrella clause”, contained in Art. 10(2). Respondent also argues that
Claimants’ claim against the ANM based on Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty also
falls outside the scope of the Tribunal’s competence, because it is contractual in

nature and the Mining Contract contains its own forum-selection clause (8°

Claimants argue that Respondent’s interpretation of Art. 11(3) is incorrect, and that
the Tribunal is competent over the claims based on the umbrella clause of the
Treaty. Claimants also submit that all of their claims are based on breaches of the
Treaty, not of the Mining Contract, and that Respondent’s objection is groundless
(2).

After summarizing the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal will make its decision (3).
RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Respondent explains that Claimants’ claims relate to the conduct of the Contraloria
and to the conduct of the ANM:5°?

- One of Claimants’ claims is that Colombia breached Art. 10(2) of the Treaty,
which requires Colombia to observe obligations deriving from a written
agreement concluded between its central government, or agencies thereof, and
an investor of the other Party, with regard to a specific investment [the
“Umbrella Clause”];*°?

- Another of Claimants’ claims is that Colombia breached Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of
the Treaty.

According to Respondent, Claimants’ claims fall outside the scope of the Tribunal’s
854

competence for two reasons:
- First, Colombia has not consented to arbitrate claims arising in relation with the
Umbrella Clause contained in Art. 10(2) of the Treaty (A.);

- Second, the claim against the ANM is contractual in nature and must be tried
before the Colombian courts, pursuant to the forum-selection clause contained
in the Mining Contract (B.).

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

A. No Competence over Claims Grounded in the Umbrella Clause

Respondent submits that Art. 11(3) of the Treaty contains a carve-out: Colombia
has not given its consent to submit to international arbitration disputes which may
arise on the basis of the Umbrella Clause of Art. 10(2). As a consequence, to the
extent that Claimants’ claims against the ANM and the Contraloria are grounded
on the Umbrella Clause, they may not be heard in this arbitration.*°>

Respondent refers to two paragraphs of Claimants’ Reply Memorial, and says that

the claims in question fall outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction:**°

- The claim that “the [Contraloria’s Decision] effectively nullified the

commitments in the Eighth Amendment with regard to 2010 by requiring
Prodeco to pay royalties and compensation as if the Eighth Amendment did not
exist”; and

- The claim that “the State Mining Agency’s efforts to abrogate its commitments

under the Eighth Amendment [which] breach its obligations to perform the
Mining Contract and the Eighth Amendment in good faith”.

Respondent says that Claimants’ position is that the exception contained in
Art. 11(3) means that Colombia has given its consent to arbitrate claims which fall
under the Umbrella Clause, but that this consent is “conditional” and “revocable”.
Respondent finds that Claimants’ position is untenable for four reasons.*°”

First, Respondent argues that the language of the Treaty is unequivocal and does
not call for interpretation: Colombia has not given its consent to arbitrate claims
related to the Umbrella Clause. This conclusion has been supported by several
commentators of the Treaty.*°*

Respondent submits that it is a matter of policy for Colombia to exclude umbrella
clauses from the scope of its consent to arbitrate, so as to avoid extending the
jurisdiction of an international investment tribunal over claims arising out of
contract breaches. *°°

Second, even assuming that the wording of Art. 11(3) is unclear and interpretation
is necessary, such interpretation must be made in accordance with Art. 31 of the
VCLT, considering the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty in their context.
According to Art. 31(2) of the VCLT, such context includes the preamble and any
annexes to the Treaty. One of these annexes is the Protocol to the Treaty [the
“Protocol”].

The Protocol provides that on request of a party five years after the entry into force
of the Treaty, or at any time thereafter, the parties shall consult to assess whether

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

the provision on consent with respect to Art. 10(2) is still appropriate, in view of
the way in which the Treaty has been performed. Respondent finds that the Protocol
provides the parties with an opportunity to assess whether the exclusion of consent
is still appropriate — and that it is implicit that, should the parties find that it is no
longer appropriate to exclude consent, they could consider extending it to disputes
related to Art. 10(2).°°

Third, Respondent submits that the evolution of the negotiations of the Treaty
between Colombia and Switzerland is consistent with their intention to exclude —
rather than to qualify — their consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims. A draft
version of the Treaty did not contain the limitation to consent, which was later
introduced in Art. 11(3).°*!

Fourth, Respondent contends that Claimants’ argument, according to which the
words “unconditional and irrevocable” must be taken to mean that the parties to the
Treaty intended to qualify their consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause disputes,
because otherwise such words would be deprived of effet utile, is also unavailing.*°?

Respondent argues that if its offer to arbitrate disputes with regard to Art. 10(2)

matters were conditional, it would be expressly conditioned upon a specific

uncertain event; Claimants have not even tried to prove that there was such an
863

event.

Respondent avers that, in any event, the terms “unconditional” or “irrevocable”
were simply used to embellish and emphasize the significance of the offer to
arbitrate made by the contracting States to the Treaty.°*

In light of the above, Respondent concludes that to the extent that the claim against
the Contraloria and the claim against the ANM are grounded on the Umbrella
Clause, they fall outside the scope of the Tribunal’s competence.**

B. Claim against the ANM is Contractual in Nature

Respondent submits that, even assuming that the Umbrella Clause were not
excluded from the scope of Colombia’s consent to arbitration (quod non), the claim
against the ANM would still have to be excluded: the claim against the ANM is
purely contractual in nature, and the Mining Contract contains its own dispute-
resolution clause. Consequently, the claim against the ANM cannot be tried in the
present proceedings.*°°

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

First, Respondent argues that in this arbitration Claimants are submitting a purely
contractual claim against the ANM:**’ the contention that the ANM’s pursuit of the
Procedure for Contractual Annulment implies a breach of Colombia’s obligations
under Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.

Respondent says that in order to determine whether, as a matter of jurisdiction, a
claim is contractual in nature or presupposes a Treaty violation, the Tribunal must
apply the “fundamental basis” test enunciated by the Vivendi annulment

committee:*°*

- If the fundamental basis of the claim is “a treaty laying down an independent

standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged”, the claim in
question is a treaty claim;

- Conversely, when the standard against which conduct must be measured is a

contract, the claim is contractual in nature and must be determined in the
contractually-selected forum.

Respondent argues that in the present case, the fundamental basis of the claim
against the ANM, as described by Claimants, is the State agency’s alleged attempt
to have the Eighth Amendment declared null and void. Claimants view this as a
lack of good faith in the performance of contractual obligations, which, under
Colombian law, is a breach of a contractual obligation. Claimants do not argue that,
in seeking the nullification of the Eighth Amendment, the ANM would have gone
beyond acting as an ordinary party to a contract.°©?

Respondent contends that even if the claim against the ANM is grounded in
Art. 10(2) of the Treaty, its fundamental basis is the Eighth Amendment. Even when
they seek to frame this claim as a Treaty claim for breach of the fair and equitable
standard of treatment, Claimants still only describe it as a contractual breach.°”°

Second, Respondent points out that Clause 39 of the Mining Contract contains a
contractually agreed upon dispute resolution clause. This means that contractual
claims cannot be decided in treaty-based arbitration, but have another contractually-
agreed forum. This was confirmed in the SGS and Bureau Veritas cases.*”!

Respondent finds that the fact that the contractual claim against the ANM is
submitted by Glencore, instead of Prodeco, does not change this conclusion. It is
undisputed that the contractually agreed dispute resolution clause of the Mining

Contract does not bind Glencore. However, Glencore cannot raise contractual
claims precisely because Glencore is not privy to the Mining Contract.*””

In sum, Respondent argues that the claim against the ANM falls outside the scope
of the Tribunal’s competence, since it is contractual in nature and the Mining
Contract contains its own dispute resolution clause.*”

CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

Claimants argue that Colombia’s objections to the Umbrella Clause claim have no
merit and should be dismissed (A.). Similarly, Claimants argue that their Treaty
claims regarding the ANM’s actions are not contractual in nature, and therefore are
not precluded by the forum selection clause in the Mining Contract (B.).

A, Umbrella Clause Objection Lacks Merit

Claimants note that Colombia argues that Claimants’ Umbrella Clause claims are
excluded from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal pursuant to Art. 11(3) of the Treaty.
Claimants find that Colombia’s interpretation of the Treaty is incorrect.°”*

According to Claimants, the Parties agree that Art. 11(3) creates an exception for
claims regarding breaches of the Umbrella Clause, set out in Art. 10(2) of the
Treaty, from the general regime of “unconditional and irrevocable consent” to
submit investment disputes to international arbitration. However, the Parties
disagree on whether the meaning of the text is that the exception relates to the
State’s consent itself (Respondent’s position) or to the unconditional and
irrevocable nature of the consent (Claimants’ position).*”>

Claimants contend that both Parties acknowledge that the provision of Art. 11(3) of
the Treaty must be interpreted in accordance with Art. 31 of the VCLT, considering
the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context, which includes the preamble and
annexes to the Treaty.*”°

Claimants submit that the context of the Treaty text is the structure of Art. 11
itself:877

- Art. 11(1) provides that an investor that “considers that a measure applied by
[Colombia] is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement” may request
amicable consultations;

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- Art. 11(2) provides that if the matter is not settled within six months, it may be

referred to arbitration, to a venue to be chosen by the investor, thereby entitling
the investor to resort to arbitration;

- Art. 11(3) notes that the consent to resort to arbitration “in accordance with

paragraph 2” is “unconditional and irrevocable”, “except for disputes with
regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 [the umbrella clause]”.

According to Claimants, the principle of effet utile requires that the term
“unconditional and irrevocable” be given meaning. Claimants submit that the
meaning is that Colombia was empowered to condition or revoke its consent to
arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims until that consent was perfected.*”*

Claimants find that this interpretation is confirmed by Art. 11(2) of the Protocol of
the Treaty, which expressly describes Art. 11(3) as a “provision on consent with
respect to Article 10 of paragraph 2”, over which the parties could consult in the
future with a view to assessing its appropriateness. Claimants argue that the text
implies that there is “consent with respect to Article 10 of paragraph 2”.87°

Similarly, an early draft of the relevant Umbrella Clause reads that each contracting
party gives its consent to the submission of an investment dispute to international
arbitration. Claimants say that if Colombia intended to exclude claims under the
Umbrella Clause from its consent to arbitrate, it merely needed to add “except for
disputes with regard to [...]” at the end of this text. However, the text of this
provision only changed the reference to the consent by qualifying it as
“unconditional and irrevocable”.®*°

Contrary to Respondent’s submission, Claimants explain that Art. 11(2) of the
Protocol does not describe Art. 11(3) as providing qualified consent. If the parties
to the Treaty had not consented at all to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims, they
would not have referred to their “consent with respect to the umbrella clause
claims” in the Protocol.**!

Claimants argue that Art. 11(3) would have allowed Colombia to impose conditions
to its consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims (e.g., prior resort to the
contractual forum) until Claimants provided their reciprocal consent, just as it
would have allowed Colombia to revoke its consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause
claims until that consent was perfected.**?

B. No Contractual Claims Against the ANM

Claimants find that Respondent’s arguments, according to which the “Claim against
the ANM” is purely contractual in nature and cannot be heard by this Tribunal, are
incorrect.5*

First, Claimants note that Colombia’s references to the “Claim against the ANM”
are a mischaracterization of Claimants’ claims. Claimants bring claims under the
Treaty against Colombia, not the ANM. These Treaty claims are predicated upon
Colombia’s coordinated measures, through the Contraloria and the ANM, to nullify
the commitments in the Eighth Amendment upon which Claimants relied to invest
in the expansion of the Mine. These are not separate claims and are not “purely
contractual in nature”.**4

Claimants explain that the measures taken by Colombia were inconsistent with
Colombia’s international obligations under the Treaty (not the ANM’s domestic
law obligations under the Mining Contract), including the obligations:**°

- To accord Claimants’ investments fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Art.

4(2) of the Treaty;

- Not to impair the management, use, enjoyment and expansion of Claimants’

investments through unreasonable measures pursuant to Art. 4(1) of the Treaty;

- To “observe any obligation deriving from a written agreement concluded

between its central government or agencies thereof and an investor of the other
Party with regard to a specific investment, which the investor could rely on in
good faith when establishing, acquiring or expanding the investment”, pursuant
to Art. 10(2) of the Treaty.

Claimants submit that the mere reference in Claimants’ Memorial to the State’s
obligations under the Eighth Amendment does not affect the characterization of
Claimants’ treaty claims. If mere references to contractual obligations were
sufficient to render a treaty claim inadmissible, investment treaties would be
deprived of meaningful effect, since most foreign investment is made through a
contract (and most investment claims concern government interference in
contractual rights). According to Claimants, this does not make the claims
contractual, particularly where, as here, Colombia is seeking to repudiate the entire
contractual amendment and has made no allegations that the amendment has been
breached. **°

Second, Claimants’ claims relating to Colombia’s breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of
the Treaty are not contractual in nature. Claimants argue that the ANM acted

inconsistently, unreasonably and in breach of Claimants’ legitimate expectations
when it initiated the Procedure for Contractual Annulment. The ANM went back
on its representations, after negotiating the Eighth Amendment and approving the
investment plan for the expansion of the Mine, and after Claimants had already
made investments. **”

Claimants accept that the relevant test to determine if Claimants’ claims are
contract-based or treaty-based is the “fundamental basis” test. Claimants submit
that the fundamental basis of Claimants’ claims is the Treaty: the claims are brought
by reference to Treaty standards — i.e. the frustration of legitimate expectations
through the unreasonable and arbitrary repudiation of the State’s contractual
commitments upon which investors relied to make a massive investment in the
expansion of the Mine — not contractual provisions.***

According to Claimants, the mere fact that their claims relate to State conduct in
relation to a contract does not mean that the claims are contractual in nature, as
expressed by the tribunal in the Crystallex case. In the Crystallex case, the investor
did not complain that a State agency breached specific contract provisions, but
rather that it sought to repudiate the entire contract upon which the investor had
relied in making its investments. The tribunal rejected the State’s assertion that the
claim was purely contractual in nature.**°

Claimants admit that the forum-selection clause of the Mining Contract applies to
contractual claims; however, this clause is irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes in
this case, given that Claimants have not raised contractual claims. In any event, the
dispute resolution clause in the Mining Contract does not bind Glencore, as
recognised by Colombia.*”°

Third, Claimants argue that Colombia, through the conduct of the ANM and the
Contraloria, failed to observe its obligations under the Eighth Amendment, in
violation of the Umbrella Clause of the Treaty. Claimants submit that, as in all
umbrella clause claims, these claims are predicated on the State’s failure to observe
municipal law and contractual obligations in relation to investments, although the
finding of liability under an umbrella clause is ultimately a determination made
under international law.*?!

 

Claimants explain that when a claimant brings a claim under an umbrella clause,
that investor is not bringing the claim under a contract — it remains a claim for the
violation of a Treaty standard; otherwise, umbrella clauses would be deprived of
meaning.*” In the SGS case, the tribunal distinguished between contract claims and
treaty claims. Similarly, the tribunal emphatically denied that a contractual forum-

selection clause could deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction to hear the investor’s
umbrella clause claim under the treaty.

Claimants conclude that there is no basis for the Tribunal to decline competence
over Claimants’ claims.°°*

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

The Tribunal is tasked with determining whether Claimants can bring a claim
against Colombia under the Umbrella Clause of the Treaty: the Tribunal will first
establish the relevant provisions (3.1) and will then turn to the interpretation of one
of these provisions, Art. 11(3) of the Treaty (3.2). Thereafter, the Tribunal will
examine the nature of the so-called “Claim against the ANM” (3.3)

(3.1) RELEVANT PROVISIONS

Art. 10 of the Treaty establishes certain obligations of the State parties to the Treaty.
One of these obligations is enshrined in paragraph 2 of Art. 10 and reads as
follows:°%

“Each Party shall observe any obligation deriving from a written agreement
concluded between its central government or agencies thereof and an investor
of the other Party with regard to a specific investment, which the investor
could rely on in good faith when establishing, acquiring or expanding the
investment”.

This Umbrella Clause imposes on the State, as a matter of Treaty law, the
observance of obligations stemming from a written agreement concluded between
its government or agencies and the investor.*?®

On the other hand, Art. 11 of the Treaty provides for the settlement of disputes
between a host State and an investor. Art. 11(2) establishes that if such investor
considers that a measure applied by the host State is inconsistent with an obligation
under the Treaty, it may refer the matter to the national courts of the host State or
to international arbitration, once the six-month period for amicable settlement has
expired. Pursuant to Art. 11(3):°°7

“Each [State] Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to
the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in
accordance with paragraph [11(2)] above, except for disputes with regard to
Article 10 paragraph 2 of this Agreement”. [Emphasis added]

Respondent submits that in accordance with Art. 11(3), it has not given its consent
to arbitrate disputes which fall under the scope of the Umbrella Clause set out in

C IL, paras. 138-139, referring to SGS v. Paraguay, para. 130, and also to Garanti Koza, paras, 331-

Art. 10(2) of the Treaty. As a consequence, argues Respondent, the Tribunal lacks
competence to decide on Claimants’ claims to the extent they are grounded on Art.
10(2) of the Treaty.

995. Claimants disagree and argue that Respondent makes an incorrect reading of
Art. 11(3): in Claimants’ view, Colombia has given its consent to arbitrate disputes
with regard to Art. 10(2), just not an “unconditional and irrevocable” consent.

996. The Tribunal must interpret the meaning of Art. 11(3). To do so, the Tribunal will
resort to the VCLT, which both Parties agree contains the relevant standard for the
interpretation of the Treaty.*°*

(3.2) INTERPRETATION OF ART. 11(3) OF THE TREATY
997. Art. 31 of the VCLT provides the “General Rule of Interpretation” of treaties:*°?
“1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary

meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose.

 

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise,
in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

 

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the
parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with
the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument
related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation
of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes
the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between
the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties
so intended”. [Emphasis added]

998. In accordance with the primary rule of interpretation, the Tribunal must interpret

the ordinary meaning of the terms (A.) in their context; the context is understood as
not only the text of the Treaty, but also its preamble and any annexes (B.).

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

999. Art. 32 of the Treaty contains “Supplementary Means of Interpretation”:

“Recourse may be had to means of inter ion, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order

to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to
determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable”. [Emphasis
added]

1000. In order to confirm that the primary interpretation is correct, the Tribunal may avail
itself of the preparatory works of the Treaty, including any drafts (C.). Before
turning to the scholarly interpretation of Art. 11(3) (E.), the Tribunal will address
Claimants’ effet utile counter-argument (D.).

A. Ordinary Meaning
1001. Pursuant to Art. 11(3):

“each Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to the
submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in accordance
with paragraph 2 above, except for disputes with regard to Article 10
paragraph 2 of [the Treaty)”. [Emphasis added]

1002. The plain reading of Art. 11(3) leaves little room for doubts: each State party gives
its unconditional and irrevocable consent to have investment disputes submitted to
international arbitration, with one exception: disputes with regard to Art. 10(2), the
Umbrella Clause.

1003.Thus, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms, Colombia’s
interpretation of Art. 11(3) is correct: Colombia has given its consent to arbitrate
investment disputes which may arise from the Treaty, except for those which fall
under the Umbrella Clause.

B. Context
1004. The context confirms the ordinary meaning of Art. 11(3).

1005. Pursuant to Art. 31(2) of the VCLT, the context includes the preamble and annexes
to the Treaty. One of these annexes is the Protocol of the Treaty, which contains

“provisions which shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Agreement”.°°!

1006. Adding to Art. 11 of the Treaty, Art. 11(2) of the Protocol provides that:°

“(2) With regard to paragraph 3 of the said Article [11], on request of a Party
five years after the entry into force of this Agreement or at any time thereafter,
the Parties shall consult with a view to assessing whether the provision on
consent with respect to Article 10 paragraph 2 is appropriate considering the
performance of this Agreement”. [Emphasis added]

1007. The Parties disagree on what should be understood from this provision:

- Respondent argues that the Protocol provides the State parties with an
903

opportunity to assess whether the exclusion of consent remains appropriate;

- Claimants, on the other hand, contend that the Protocol implies that there is
“consent with respect to Article 10 of paragraph 2”; and they further aver that
the qualified nature of consent need not be referenced in the Protocol, since it
was already set out in Art. 11(3) itself.°°*

1008. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent’s argument on this point.

1009. The wording of Art. 11(2) of the Protocol, combined with the ordinary meaning of
Art. 11(3) of the Treaty, supports only one conclusion: in Art. 11(3) of the Treaty
the State parties excluded Umbrella Clause disputes from their consent to arbitrate;
but, conscious that such exclusion in practical terms deprived the Umbrella Clause
of effectiveness, in Art. 11(2) of the Protocol they agreed to review their decision,
after a five-year period of experience, in light of the performance of the Treaty and
upon request of one of the State parties.

C. Preparatory Work

1010. For the sake of exhaustiveness, the Tribunal will also analyse a draft Treaty of July
1996. Art. 9 of said draft, on “Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor
of the other Contracting Party”, contained two “options” for the relevant text.

1011. Art. 9(3) of “Option 1” provided that:°°

“(3) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an
investment dispute to international arbitration.”

1012.Thus, in this draft, the State parties agreed to give their consent to the submission
of investment disputes to international arbitration, without any exception. It is
interesting to note that this draft Treaty did not contain an umbrella clause or any
similar provision.

1013.It thus seems that in the 1996 negotiations, Switzerland and Colombia did not
contemplate the possibility of having an umbrella clause, and consequently did not
exclude such disputes from the scope of their consent to international arbitration.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

This is consistent with Colombia’s policy not to include an umbrella clause in its
model bilateral investment treaty;?”° and it confirms the Tribunal’s analysis of
Art. 11(3) so far.

D. Claimants’ effet utile Counter-Argument

1014.Claimants argue that the principle of effet utile requires that the terms

“unconditional and irrevocable” used in Art. 11(3) of the Treaty be given meaning.
To achieve this aim, Claimants propose to construe the provision as implying that
Colombia’s general consent to international arbitration is unconditional and
irrevocable, with one exception: Colombia can condition and revoke its consent to
arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims before such consent has been perfected.

1015.Claimants’ argument is premised on the use by the Treaty of the words

“unconditional and irrevocable consent”. Claimants then argue that consent, by its
nature, is “unconditional and irrevocable”, and that, for a proper construction of the
Treaty, it is necessary to provide these words with effet utile. In an effort to solve
this self-imposed riddle, Claimants propose an idiosyncratic interpretation,
differentiating two different types of consent:°””

- “conditional and revocable consent”, which applies to Umbrella Clause claims,
and

- “unconditional and irrevocable consent”, which applies to all other types of
claims.

1016. The Tribunal is unconvinced.

1017. Art. 11(3) reads as follows:

“Each [State] Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to
the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in
accordance with paragraph [11(2)] above, except for disputes with regard to
Article 10 paragraph 2 of this Agreement.”

1018. Claimants’ proposed construction is simply an a contrario interpretation of the text.

The Treaty says that consent to international arbitration is unconditional and
irrevocable — not that consent for Umbrella Clause disputes can be conditioned and
even revoked by the State. Claimants’ construction creates more doubts than it
dispels: assuming Claimants’ interpretation, how States can condition their consent,

°© Doc. RL-46, p. 40 of the PDF: “As a strict policy matter, the Model does not include an ‘umbrella
clause’, which arguably could automatically render a breach of a contract related to an investment into a
treaty breach, regardless of the failure to comply with any of the usual treaty obligations of an IIA [...].
Reasons not to incorporate an umbrella clause in the Model include the broad and general commitment of
accepting investor-State arbitration if an investor alleges a breach [...] of any investment commitment or

contract related to an investment, and the unassessed costs that this ty

 

ype of commitment could involve for

the State and agencies thereof. [...] The practice of Colombia in rejecting the inclusion of an umbrella

 

clause has been highly cons

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

and what temporal limits apply to the right of revocation, are questions which
remain unanswered.

In fact, the proper interpretation of Art. 11(3) is much more straightforward: the
parties to the Treaty were simply trying to assert that they consented to international
arbitration for all types of investment disputes, except for those deriving from the
Umbrella Clause. The terms “unconditional and irrevocable” were used to specify
the nature of the generic consent that the State parties to the Treaty were making —
not to extend a phantom “conditional and revocable” consent to Umbrella Clause
disputes.

Further, Claimants’ effet utile argument seems to rest on a false premise, i.e. that
consent to arbitration is inherently unconditional and irrevocable. That premise is
false because, on a blank canvas (that is, without regard to the specific provisions
of the Treaty), a State may give its consent to arbitration conditionally. Art. 26 of
the ICSID Convention specifically authorizes a Contracting State to require the
exhaustion of administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to
arbitration under the Convention.** Similarly, in principle a State may give its
generic consent to arbitration but reserve the right to revoke such consent in the
future unilaterally. It is precisely to prevent such unilateral revocation that Art.
25(1) of the ICSID Convention deprives any such revocation of effect once all
parties to the dispute have given their consent in writing to submit their dispute to
ICSID arbitration. Therefore, the term “unconditional and irrevocable” used to
qualify the generic consent given by the State parties to the Treaty already has
useful effects, and very important ones, without having to postulate additional
effects based on Claimants’ a contrario argument.

E. Scholarly Opinions

The Tribunal’s opinion is confirmed by that of several scholars who have analysed
the provisions of the Treaty.

1022. As explained by Profs. T. Gazzini and Y. Radi in an article on the “Practice and

Interpretation of ‘Umbrella Clauses’ in the Latin American Experience”:?!°

“The second category of umbrella clauses, less common than the previous one,
imposes upon the parties as a matter of treaty law the observance of

ing from external legal instruments, but_excludes_the
settlement of the related disputes from the procedural provisions of the treaty.

The BIT between Colombia and Switzerland contains an interesting drafting
variant. According to Article 10(2): [...]

98 ICSID Convention, Art. 26 in fine. The extent to which the States Parties to the Treaty availed themselves
of this authorization is analysed in section V.3.(3.2).E infra.

99 Td,

Art. 25(1) in fine.

164).

217

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

The arbitral clause contained in Article 11(3) of the same treaty provides for

the unconditional and irrevocable consent to the submission of disputes to
international arbitration with the express exclusion of those related to Article
10(2).

This type of provision can be treated as an umbrella clause under the broad
definition provided in the introduction. Indeed, the contracting parties
undertake to comply as a matter of treaty law with the obligations arising out
of legal instruments external to the treaty. Needless to say, the fact that foreign

investors have no access to international arbitration with regard to violations
of these obligations — as it is potentially the case for the first category of
clauses — clearly diminishes the added value of the clause from the dpoi:

of the protection of foreign investments.” [Emphasis added]

1023.Similarly, Mr. José Antonio Rivas, who served as Director of Foreign Direct
Investment of the Ministry of Trade of Colombia between 2006 and 2009, and
participated in the drafting of the Treaty,*!' affirmed in a chapter dedicated to
Colombia of the Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties that:°!”

“The Switzerland—Colombia BIT (2007) and Japan—Colombia BIT (2011)
have typical umbrella clauses, but the parties to these treaties have not given
their consent to investor-State arbitration when an investor alleges a breach of
the respective umbrella clause.” [Emphasis added]

1024.The opinion of these commentators confirms the Tribunal’s interpretation of
Art. 11(3): the State parties to the Treaty withheld their consent to solve Umbrella
Clause disputes by way of international arbitration.

ak oe ok
1025.For all the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it lacks competence to

adjudicate claims brought under the Umbrella Clause contained in Art. 10(2) of the
Treaty.

(3.3) COMPETENCE OVER THE “CLAIM AGAINST THE ANM”

1026.Respondent contends that the “Claim against the ANM” is purely contractual in
nature and thus cannot be heard in the present arbitration, since the Mining Contract
contains a dispute resolution clause.!*

1027. Clause 39 of the Mining Contract indeed provides that:
“[...] Este contrato se rige en todas sus partes por la Ley Colombiana y EL

CONTRATISTA se somete a la jurisdiccién de los tribunales col

218

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1028. The Tribunal’s task is then to determine whether in the present arbitration Claimants
have indeed filed contractual claims — if they had done so, such claims would fall
outside the scope of the Tribunal’s competence.

1029. The Tribunal notes, as a preliminary matter that, contrary to Respondent’s assertion,
Claimants have not brought a “Claim against the ANM”. Claimants have brought
claims against Colombia. These claims include Colombia’s decision (adopted
through its successive mining agencies, SGC and ANM) to file the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment and seek nullification of the Eighth Amendment. Claimants
say that this filing resulted in a breach of the FET standard, because the measure

- was an attempt to repudiate the Republic’s commitments and frustrates
Claimants’ legitimate expectations;?!*

- was arbitrary, unreasonable and in bad faith.?!5

1030. According to Claimants, by adopting the Contraloria’s Decision and starting the
Procedure for Contractual Annulment, Colombia breached its obligations under the
Treaty.°!°

A, Fundamental Basis Test

1031.The Parties agree that in order to determine whether a claim is contractual in nature,
the Tribunal must analyse the “fundamental basis of the claim”, as established by
the Vivendi annulment committee. In particular, the Tribunal must establish:?!”

- whether the fundamental basis of the claim is a treaty laying down an
independent standard by which the conduct of the Parties is to be judged, or

- whether the standard against which the conduct of the Parties must be measured
is a contract.

1032. In its decision, the Vivendi annulment committee explained that:?!8

“95. As to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the
present case, it must be stressed that Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate
directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set_an independent
standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice
versa, and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT. The point is
made clear in Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which is entitled “Characterization
of an act of a State as internationally wrongful”:

 

214 CT, para. 198.

915 C | paras, 201-202 and 216.

916 See Section VII infra.

917 R IL, para. 536; C Ill, para, 127. See also Vivendi, para. 101.

219

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is
governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by
the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.

96. In accordance with this general principle (which is undoubtedly
declaratory of general international law), whether there has been a breach of
the BIT and whether there has been _a breach of contract_are different
questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own
proper or applicable law — in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the
case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract [...].”

1033.These conclusions were confirmed by the Crystallex tribunal. That tribunal also

explained that in order to determine the fundamental basis of the claimant’s claim,
it had to start by analysing claimant’s prayers for relief (B.) and the formulation of
its claims (C.).°!° Since the Parties have validated the approach of the Crystallex
tribunal,””° the Arbitral Tribunal will follow the same methodology.

B. Claimants’ Prayers for Relief

1034. Claimants’ main request for relief is a declaration: that Colombia’s measures

(including its decision to file the Procedure for Contractual Annulment) have
resulted in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. Claimants also ask for a
declaration that Colombia has breached the Umbrella Clause, Art. 10(2) of the
Treaty; but the Tribunal has already found in Section V.3(3.2) supra that it lacks
competence to adjudicate any dispute relating to the Umbrella Clause.*”!

1035. As a consequence of such declaration, Claimants request that the Tribunal order the

Republic of Colombia to procure the cessation of the Procedure for Contractual
Annulment with prejudice.?”?

1036. Prima facie, Claimants have made no claims for breach of contractual provisions

1037. Yet, as explained by the Crystallex tribunal

and none of the above claims is contractual in nature. Claimants’ claims are based
on the standards of the Treaty, which Claimants allege have been breached by
Colombia.

1:923

“[...], it would of course not be sufficient for a claimant to simply label
contract breaches as treaty breaches to avoid the jurisdictional hurdles present

in_a BIT. The Tribunal’s jurisdictional inquiry is _a_matter_of objective
determination, and the Tribunal would in case of pure “labeling” be at liberty

and have the duty to re-characterize the alleged breaches.” [Emphasis added]

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1038.The Tribunal must thus go further than Claimants’ prayers for relief, in order to
determine whether Claimants’ claims are contractual or Treaty-based.

C. Formulation of Claimants’ Claims
1039. According to Respondent, even when Claimants

“seek to frame the Claim against the ANM as a treaty claim for breach of the
fair and equitable standard of treatment under Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the
Treaty, Claimants still only describe it as a contractual breach.”

To prove its assertion, Respondent makes reference to para. 223 of Claimants’
Memorial of 16 December 2016.°*4

1040. The Tribunal finds Respondent’s argument unconvincing.

1041. Para. 223 of Claimants’ Memorial relates to Claimants’ claims which are grounded
on the Umbrella Clause, not on Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal has
already found that it does not have competence over claims grounded on Art. 10(2).

1042.The basis of Claimants’ claim relating to the conduct of the ANM is the State
agency’s alleged attempt to have the Eighth Amendment declared null and void by
the Colombian administrative courts. Claimants argue that the mere filing of the
Procedure for Contractual Annulment breached Colombia’s obligations under Arts.
4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty, because:°”°

- it contravened Claimants’ legitimate expectations, since the Procedure was
started after Claimants had relied on the Eighth Amendment and made
significant investments in Colombia;

- it failed to treat Claimants’ investments in a consistent, predictable, and
transparent manner, since the Procedure took place after Prodeco and
Ingeominas had negotiated extensively, and after Ingeominas had approved
Prodeco’s 2010 PTI; and

- it took an arbitrary and unreasonable stance, since it sought unilaterally to
withdraw the undertakings and assurances given by Ingeominas to Claimants,
without a reasoned judgment.

1043.Claimants measure Colombia’s conduct against the standards of the Treaty and not
against contractual standards: the fundamental basis of Claimants’ claims is the
Treaty, not the Mining Contract.

1044. As established by the Crystallex tribunal, whether the Claimants’ claims are well-
founded in law and whether the facts underlying those claims may implicate the

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Respondent’s liability under the substantive standards of the Treaty are questions
to be dealt with in the merits.°”°

ok ok
1045. In sum, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the so-called “Claim against the ANM” is
contractual in nature and falls outside the scope of the Tribunal’s competence

insofar as it is grounded in Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. Therefore,
Respondent’s objection is dismissed.

V.4. INADMISSIBILITY OBJECTION

1047.Respondent contends that if, par impossible, the Tribunal were to decide that either
Claimants’ claim against the Contraloria, or the claim against the ANM, fall within
the scope of its jurisdiction, such claims are not yet ripe for adjudication and are,
thus, inadmissible (1).

1048.Claimants say that their claims concern measures already adopted by the State,
which are in breach of the Treaty, and have caused a loss or damage to Claimants’
investment. These claims are therefore fully ripe for adjudication (2).

1049.The Tribunal will start by summarizing the Parties’ positions and then make its
decision (3).

(1) RESPONDENT’S POSITION

1050.Respondent avers that Claimants’ claims are premature and, therefore,
inadmissible, for several reasons.

1051.As a preliminary point, Respondent notes that Claimants ask that the Tribunal order
Colombia to “continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment”. Yet,
Respondent argues, Claimants continue to own and operate the Calenturitas Mine
and the Parties continue to comply with the Eighth Amendment. In sum, Claimants
want to be placed in the same condition in which they are today. According to
Respondent, this shows that Claimants’ claims are pre-emptive and hypothetical.°””

Absence of a measure by the State

1052. Respondent submits that under the Treaty the Tribunal’s jurisdiction extends only
to “a measure applied by the other Party [which] is inconsistent with an obligation
of this Agreement, thus causing loss or damage to [the investor] or his
investment”.°?* According to Respondent, a claim based on potential harm to the
investment, arising out of a measure which has not yet been implemented, is not
admissible under international law.°””

1053.Respondent refers to the Gabdcikovo-Nagymoros case, in which the International
Court of Justice [“ICJ”] distinguished between the internationally wrongful act
itself, and the conduct which preceded such act, which is of preparatory nature and
does not qualify as an internationally wrongful act.°*°

1054.Respondent argues that in the present case, the Procedure for Contractual
Annulment, which consists in submitting a contract for review and annulment to a
court of law, does not constitute an internationally wrongful act, and cannot give

obligations. **

indeed, there has been no breach of the State’s

Absence of harm to the investor

1055.Respondent further contends that the Treaty requires that the State’s measure
caused a “loss or damage” to the investor or its investment. In the present case,
Claimants’ claims are premature and inadmissible, because Claimants have
suffered no harm whatsoever.°*

1056. First, regarding the claim against the ANM’s conduct, Respondent points out that
the Procedure for Contractual Annulment is still pending before the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca and it is unknown whether the Eighth
Amendment will be annulled. Respondent avers that “loss or damage” can only
occur if and when the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca renders a decision
nullifying the Eighth Amendment.?**+

1057. Respondent further argues that Claimants’ claim against the ANM’s conduct must
fail, since Claimants have not suffered any monetary harm.*?> Tellingly, Claimants
did not disclose any contingency or record any impairment loss arising out of the
Procedure for Contractual Annulment. Instead, Claimants expressed to the market
their utmost confidence that the validity of the Eighth Amendment would be
confirmed.°*°

1058. Second, as to Claimants’ claim against the Contraloria, Respondent argues that it
is also inadmissible and not ripe, since Claimants have suffered no harm. The claim
against the Contraloria is currently limited to recovering the Fiscal Liability
Amount. Respondent notes that Claimants have challenged the Contraloria’s
Decision before the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca, and a decision is
pending. In its financial statements, Prodeco has characterized the chance of losing
the claim against the Contraloria’s Decision as remote.”” As a result, assuming
that the claim against the Contraloria is not dismissed on the basis of the Fork in
the Road Objection, such claim is, in any event, not ripe.?*8

Review by the competent State authority

1059. According to Respondent, international case-law shows that the State cannot be
held liable for the acts of a State’s official if the investor has not attempted, when
possible, to have the act reviewed by the competent State authority. This approach

was adopted by the Generation Ukraine and by the EnCana _tribunals.”?

Respondent submits that in the present case, this condition for a claim to be ripe has
even more impact, since the Treaty requires that the investor show that it has
suffered “loss or harm” before submitting a claim.™?

Respondent notes that this requirement is not the same as a requirement to exhaust
local remedies. Respondent points to the award in Generation Ukraine, in which
the tribunal found that exhaustion of local remedies is entirely distinct from the
principle that a State official’s conduct cannot ripen into an international delict,
absent an effective attempt by the investor to have such act reviewed by the
competent State authority.*4!

Conclusion

In_ sum, Respondent argues that the local proceedings that Claimants have
commenced must run their course as a pre-condition to the ripeness of Claimants’
claims against the Contraloria and the ANM. For now, Claimants have suffered no
definitive harm as a result of the conduct of any organs of the Colombian State.*4?

Alternative argument: abuse of process

Ex abundante cautela, Respondent submits that if the Tribunal were to consider that
Claimants’ claims are ripe for adjudication, the Tribunal should decline to hear such
claims because their introduction constitutes an abuse of process. Indeed, Claimants
are trying to block or inhibit the operation of Colombia’s judiciary process. In the
Rompetrol case, the tribunal found that such type of pre-emptive action was not
permitted.°#

Respondent concludes that Claimants’ claims are not ripe for adjudication and calls
for the dismissal of such claims by the Tribunal.*#*

CLAIMANTS’ POSITION
Claimants argue that Respondent’s Inadmissibility Objection is unfounded.

- The primary remedies sought are restitutionary in nature — i.e. that Colombia
give appropriate guarantees of non-repetition and make restitution of the Fiscal
Liability Amount within 90 days;

- Alternatively, if Colombia does not comply with the restitutionary relief,
Claimants ask the Tribunal to order Colombia to pay, as monetary damages, the
Fiscal Liability Amount, and to hold Claimants harmless of all retroactive
Royalty and GIC payments;

- Finally, Claimants claim forward-looking damages from the date of the Award,
which would be the NPV of the investment, estimated at USD 336 million.

Existence of a loss or damage

1066. Claimants acknowledge that the Treaty establishes the requirements that claimants

must satisfy to submit an investment claim. Of those requirements, Respondent
mainly disputes that Claimants have suffered “loss or damage” with respect to the
conduct of the ANM and the Contraloria. Claimants find that Respondent’s
argument is flawed.*4°

1067. First, Respondent contends that Claimants have not suffered any monetary harm as

a result of the ANM’s conduct because the Eighth Amendment remains in force.
Claimants counter-argue that the Treaty does not require that the relevant “loss or
damage” involve an outlay of funds, for instance in the form of the payment of
higher royalties as a result of the annulment of the Eighth Amendment. The majority
of investment cases do not involve an outlay of funds, but rather a loss in the fair
market value of the investment.°"”

1068.Claimants say that the ANM’s actions, together with other conduct attributable to

Colombia, have already negatively affected the NPV of their investments; the extent
of that loss in value is a matter to be determined in the merits.°48 Indeed, the ANM.
has adopted the position that the Eighth Amendment should be annulled, and has
commenced legal proceedings in that respect, in essence copying the reasons of the
Contraloria, with the consequent impact that such action by the regulator has on
the fair market value of Claimants’ investment.”

1069. Claimants also say that Respondent’s argument that Claimants did not disclose any

contingency or impairment as a result of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment,
is unavailing. Such a disclosure has no bearing on the market value of Claimants’
investment and the independent views of a third-party buyer.?°°

1070.Second, Claimants note that as to the Contraloria’s measures, Claimants have
already paid the Fiscal Liability Amount, and therefore Claimants have already
suffered a so-called “monetary harm”.°>!

1071.In addition, Claimants find that Respondent’s Inadmissibility Objection contradicts
the FIR Objection:

- Under the Inadmissibility Objection, Respondent argues that Claimants could
not bring a claim under the Treaty, before having challenged the impugned
measure before the local courts;

- At the same time, under the FIR Objection, Respondent says that if Claimants
first submitted a claim to local courts, they are barred from submitting a claim
under the Treaty.

1072. According to Claimants, Respondent’s position would deprive them of any legal
remedies.°>

No requirement of exhaustion of local remedies

1073. Claimants also find that Colombia is trying to write into the Treaty a non-existent
requirement of exhaustion of local remedies. Art. 11(3) of the Protocol provides
that before submitting a claim for settlement in Colombia, “domestic administrative
remedies” have to be exhausted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations;
and Claimants have complied with this requirement. There is no requirement of
exhaustion of judicial local remedies.**

1074. Claimants note that they do not claim a denial of justice that will only be perfected
once internal remedies are exhausted or justice is sufficiently delayed; nor do they
claim an expropriation. Rather, Claimants claim a breach of the fair and equitable
treatment and other standards of the Treaty on the basis of measures that have
already been adopted by Respondent.*™*

1075. According to Claimants, the case law invoked by Respondent does not support its
case. Both the Generation Ukraine and the EnCana cases related to
expropriations.°°>

Absence of an abuse of process

1076. As to Respondent’s abuse of process claim, Claimants note that Respondent merely
invokes the relief sought by Claimants, which, according to Respondent, is intended
to block or inhibit the operation of Colombia’s judiciary process. Claimants
disagree: Claimants seek a declaration of breach, restitution, and an order that

Colombia ceases its wrongful acts, a relief which does not require that the courts

act or omit to act in any manner, since the wrongful acts are the acts of non-judicial
956

actors.

1077. As to the Rompetrol case, Claimants point out that the tribunal recognised that “the
pursuit of crime — or even its mere invocation — cannot serve on its own as a
justification for conduct that breaches the rights of foreign investors under
applicable treaties”. Claimants say that in this particular case they are not asking
the Tribunal to stop the Colombian authorities from investigating crimes or
pursuing criminal procedures.”

1078.In any event, Claimants say that Colombia has not explained how a mere request
for relief could be considered so abusive as to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction
altogether. The appropriateness of the relief that Claimants seek is a matter for the
merits, not jurisdiction.?**

Conclusion

1079. Claimants conclude that the primary relief they are seeking is prescriptive in nature,
designed to ensure:

- (i) the cessation of wrongful measures already taken by Colombia in breach of
the Treaty,

- (ii) the non-repetition of such measures, and
- (iii) continued compliance with the Eighth Amendment.
(3) DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

1080. The Tribunal will first establish the proven facts (A.), and then explain its decision
(B.).
A. Proven Facts
1081.As previously explained,**? it is important to bear in mind that under Colombian
law there is a clear distinction between the (i) Administrative Fiscal Liability
Proceeding and the (ii) Procedures for Judicial Annulment of administrative
contracts.°

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Fiscal Li ty Proceeding

1082.The Contraloria is an agency of the Republic of Colombia. It is empowered to
decide whether civil servants and private individuals incurred so-called “fiscal
liability”, premised on the fulfilment of three conditions:°*!

- A “conducta dolosa o culposa”, committed by such civil servant or private
individual,

- Which causes damage to the Colombian State or any of its agencies,
- And a causal link between conduct and damage.

1083.It is noteworthy that in a contractual environment fiscal liability does not require
the violation of any norm, the breach of any contractual commitment, or any
illegality affecting the contract. It is engaged whenever a civil servant or private
individual incurs in conducta dolosa o culposa (e.g., when negotiating, executing,
or performing a contract), and such behaviour provokes damage to the State.

1084.If the investigation by the Contraloria concludes that the three requirements are
met, the Contraloria will issue an administrative act, deciding that the civil servant
or private individual has incurred fiscal liability, and simultaneously ordering that
such person pay compensation equal to the damage suffered by Colombia or its
agency.

1085.The Contraloria’s decision (“declaratoria de responsabilidad fiscal”) has no
impact on the contract, which continues in full force and effect, and has to be
complied with both by the private party and by the public party.°%

1086. A first-instance administrative decision adopted by the Contraloria can be appealed
within the Contraloria itself (“recursos en via gubernativa”’), by submitting a
recurso de reposicion or a recurso de apelacién; once these appeals have been
exhausted, the acto administrativo becomes firme and the via gubernativa is closed.
But this is not the end of the story: it is still possible to seek annulment of the acto
administrativo firme by filing an Annulment Procedure (“recurso judicial
contencioso-administrativo”) before the courts of justice.

 

Procedure for Contractual Annulment

1087. Annulment of an administrative contract entered into with the Republic or any of
its agencies is a completely different institution: such nullifications require a
judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment (“‘declaratoria de nulidad”), at the
request of any of the parties to the Contract. The requesting party bears the burden
of proving that a cause of nullity under Colombian law (e.g., illegality or lack of
consent) has occurred.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1088.Upon the decision rendered by the judge, the contract is annulled and ceases to
produce effects. Depending on the circumstances, the cessation may have
retroactive effects (ex tunc) or not (ex nunc), and the party in bonis may be entitled
to claim compensation.°™*

1089.The proven facts regarding the Fiscal Liability Proceeding have already been
detailed in Section V.3(3.1) supra and will be briefly recalled here (a.); the facts
surrounding the Procedure for Contractual Annulment will be summarized
thereafter (b.).

a. _ Fiscal Liability Proceeding

1090.On 30 April 2015, the Contralora Delegada, Ms. Vargas, issued the Contraloria’s
Decision, which found that by executing the Eighth Amendment Prodeco had
incurred in liability and ordered Prodeco and certain civil servants jointly and
severally to compensate the State for the damage caused.°®

1091.On 11 May 2015, Prodeco filed:

- Arecurso de reposicion before the Contralora Delegada, the very authority who
had issued Decision, asking for reconsideration of her Decision, and

- A recurso de apelacién before the Contralor General de la Repiiblica, the
supervisor of the Contralora Delegada.°©

1092. These administrative appeals proved unsuccessful:

- In July 2015, the Contralora Delegada rejected Prodeco’s recurso de
967

reposicion;”°’ and
- In August 2015, the Contralor General issued the Appeal Decision, thereby
confirming the Contraloria’s Decision.°*

1093. After a mandatory Request for Conciliation and an unsuccessful Conciliation with
the Contraloria, on 1 April 2016, Prodeco filed the Annulment Procedure against
the Contraloria’s Decision with the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca?”
seeking

- restitution of the amounts already paid by Prodeco in compliance with the
Contraloria’s Decision, and

- certain ancillary requests plus damages.°”?
1094. A decision by the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca remains pending.
b. Procedure for Contractual Annulment

1095.Pursuant to clause 39 of the Mining Contract, the Mining Contract is subject to
Colombian law and to the jurisdiction of Colombian courts.°”! Colombian courts
are thus empowered to adjudicate all disputes arising out of the Mining Contract —
including any dispute as regards the validity of the Contract or of its Amendments.

1096.On 30 March 2012, the SGC, invoking clause 39 of the Mining Contract, and after
an unsuccessful request for mandatory conciliation, filed the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment with the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca. The
SGC requested that the court declare the nullity of the Eighth Amendment, arguing
that such Amendment was detrimental to the general interest of the State: the
Amendment had been executed on the assumption that it would generate benefits
for the State, but this scenario had not materialized.?””

1097. Subsidiarily, the SGC requested that the Tribunal Administrativo revise the Eighth
Amendment, “de tal manera que se preserve el interés general, recuperando y
manteniendo a un futuro el equilibrio de la ecuaci6n financiera del Contrato
044/89, perdido con el desarrollo del Otrosi No. 8”.

1098. The SGC’s claim was served on Prodeco in October 2012.°73

1099.On 15 May 2013, the ANM (which had replaced the SGC) resubmitted its claim
before the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,”™ in terms which were
practically identical to the initial ones. The ANM however updated the amount of
the State’s alleged losses resulting to USD 99 M.°”>

1100.On 7 October 2013, Prodeco filed its response to the ANM’s resubmitted claim,°”®
together with a report by KPMG.°7””

1101.Prodeco said that the Eighth Amendment had been executed in accordance with
Colombia’s legislation and had been necessary to permit an expansion of the Mine.

970 Subsidiarily Prodeco also claimed against Messrs. Martinez Torres, Ballesteros and Ceballos and the
insurance companies, requesting reimbursement of the amounts paid to the Contraloria.

Prodeco also argued that the Eighth Amendment would increase Colombia’s
benefits in the long-term. According to Prodeco, the impact of the Eighth
Amendment’s on the State’s finances could be determined only at the end of the
life of the Mining Contract.°”*

1102. On 22 October 2013, the ANM filed its reply submission.?”?

1103. The Parties agree that to this day, the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca
has not issued a decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment.**°

B. Analysis and Decision of the Tribunal

1104. Claimants’ main request for relief is a declaration that Colombia’s measures have
resulted in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.°*! As a consequence of such
declaration, Claimants request that the Tribunal order the Republic of Colombia

- to continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment;?**

- to procure the cessation of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with
prejudice;

- to provide appropriate assurances and guarantees from the Contraloria that it
will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in relation to the Eighth
Amendment;?** and

- to repay to Prodeco the Fiscal Liability Amount of USD 19.1 M plus interest.**>

1105.Respondent contends that Claimants’ claims against the Contraloria and the ANM
are not yet ripe for adjudication and are, thus, inadmissible.

1106. Respondent argues that:°°°

- The local proceedings must run their course as a pre-condition to the ripeness of
Claimants’ claims against the Contraloria and the ANM;

981 C II, para. 374(a); the request was confirmed in CPHB para. 92. Claimants also ask for a declaration that
Colombia has breached the Umbrella Clause, Art. 10(2) of the Treaty; but the Tribunal has already found
in Section V.3.(3.2) supra that it lacks competence to adjudicate any dispute relating to the Umbrella
Clause.

984 C II, para. 374(d-e).

indemnifications.

986 See section V.4.(1) supra.

 

232

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- Claimants have suffered no harm and a claim based on potential harm to the
investment is not admissible under the Treaty;

- Alternatively, Claimants’ claims constitute an abuse of process, their aim being
to effectively block Colombia’s judiciary process.

1107.Claimants say that their claims concern measures already adopted by the State,
which are in breach of the Treaty, and have caused a loss or damage to Claimants’
investment. These claims are therefore fully ripe for adjudication.

1108. Claimants allege that:°°”

- The extent of the loss or damage sustained by Claimants is a matter to be
determined in the merits;

- Claimants have already paid the Fiscal Liability Amount and have, therefore
suffered a monetary harm;

- There is no requirement of exhaustion of local remedies, because Claimants are
not claiming denial of justice; and

- As to the abuse of process, Claimants are not asking the Tribunal to stop the
Colombian authorities from investigating crimes or pursuing criminal
procedures; in any case, the mere request of relief can never be an abuse of
process.

1109. Claimants’ case is that by adopting two distinct measures the Republic has breached
the assurances given in the Treaty: the Contraloria’s Decision (a.) and the
Procedure for Contractual Annulment (b.). The Tribunal will analyse each
separately. Thereafter it will devote short sub-sections to two subsidiary arguments
advanced by Respondent: non-existence of loss or damage (c.) and abuse of
process (d.). Eventually, the Tribunal will dismiss Respondent’s Inadmissibility
Objection.

a. The Contraloria’s Decision

1110.Claimants argue that the Contraloria’s Decision violates Arts. 4(1) (unreasonable
or discriminatory measures) and 4(2) (FET) of the Treaty. In essence, Claimants
say that:°88

- The Contraloria’s Decision effectively revoked the State’s commitments under
the Eighth Amendment, thereby frustrating Claimants’ legitimate
expectations;°*?

°87 See section V.4.(2) supra.
°88 CI, para. 204.

233

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- The Contraloria’s Decision is arbitrary, unreasonable and was issued in bad
faith:°°°

- The Contraloria’s Decision required Prodeco to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount
in order to avoid forfeiture of the Mining Contract as a whole; this amounted to
a unilateral and coercive attempt to rewrite the negotiated terms of the Mining
Contract;?!

- Colombia has denied Claimants due process in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding,
because Prodeco could not properly defend itself and the Contraloria did not act
even-handedly in its conduct of the proceedings.

1111.Respondent argues that such claims are premature and, thus, inadmissible.

1112.On 30 April 2015, the Contralora Delegada, Ms. Vargas, issued the Contraloria’s
Decision. Thereafter, Prodeco filed a recurso de reposicién before the Contralora
Delegada and a recurso de apelaci6n to the Contralor General de la Republica, the
superior of the Contralora Delegada.*” Both appeals have been dismissed and the
administrative act is now final (firme en via gubernativa). Prodeco has filed a
judicial Annulment Procedure with the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,
seeking to impeach the Contraloria’s Decision. The Tribunal Administrativo has
not yet issued its decision.

1113.The matter which the Tribunal must address is whether a dispute arising from an
administrative act which is already final en via gubernativa, but where the judicial
recourse is still pending, is already ripe for adjudication before an international
arbitration tribunal.

Art. 11(3) of the Protocol

1114.This very question is addressed in Art. 11(3) of the Protocol. The Spanish and
English versions of the text read as follows:

“Con respecto a Colombia, para poder someter una reclamacién para su
solucién bajo dicho Articulo [11(3) del Tratado], se debe agotar la via
gubernativa de acuerdo a las leyes y regulaciones aplicables. Ese
procedimiento en ningtin caso deberd exceder seis meses desde la fecha de su
inicio por el inversionista [...]”.

“With respect to Colombia, in order to submit a claim for settlement under the
said Article [11(3) of the Treaty], domestic administrative remedies shall be
exhausted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Such procedure
shall in no case exceed six months from the date of its initiation by the investor

[el

234

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1115.Art. 11(3) of the Protocol is applicable only to investments in Colombia (“Con
respecto a Colombia...”). It must have been inserted at the request of Colombia, to
take account of its “/eyes y regulaciones’; the Spanish text of the provision uses
Colombian legal terminology and is of special relevance for its proper construction.

1116.The rule covers claims which an investor intends to submit, based on actos
administrativos performed by the Republic or its agencies. Admissibility of such
claims is subject to a special requirement:

- The via gubernativa must be exhausted, i.e. all appeals within the public
administration itself against the administrative act must have been filed and
dismissed, so that the acto administrativo has become firme en via gubernativa;

- Alternatively, more than six months must have elapsed since the investor filed
the administrative appeal, without a final decision, which exhausts the via
gubernativa, having been rendered.

1117.The Contraloria’s Decision complies with the first alternative: all administrative
appeals have been lodged and dismissed; it is firme en via gubernativa, and
consequently Art. 11(3) of the Protocol entitles Claimants to file a claim that the
FET standard (including the prohibition of unreasonable or discriminatory
measures) has been breached.

1118.The fact that Prodeco has also filed an Annulment Procedure against the
Contraloria’s Decision with the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca is
irrelevant. The Treaty does not require that investors, before filing claims based on
breaches of Art. 4(1) or (2) of the Treaty, must exhaust local judicial remedies.°”*

1119.In this case, there is an additional reason to dismiss Respondent’s argument that
Claimants’ claims regarding the Contraloria’s Decision are not ripe for
adjudication: in the mandatory Conciliation which preceded the filing of the
Annulment Procedure, Colombia argued that the Tribunal Administrativo de
Cundinamarca lacked jurisdiction to hear such Annulment Procedure, Glencore
and Prodeco having opted to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration.*™ It is a volte
face when Colombia now argues that Claimants, in order to gain access to
international arbitration, must first exhaust the Annulment Procedure.

b. The Procedure for Contractual Annulment

1120.Claimants additionally submit that Colombia’s decision to file the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment and seek nullification of the Eighth Amendment

8 Art. 11(3) of the Protocol only requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies.

235

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

- is an attempt to repudiate the Republic’s commitments and frustrates Claimants’
legitimate expectations;°”>

- is arbitrary, unreasonable and in bad faith.°°°

1121.Respondent again argues that such claims are premature and inadmissible.

1122. The Tribunal would agree with Respondent’s line of reasoning if Claimants were
arguing that the judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment had resulted in a
denial of justice. A claim for denial of justice would indeed be premature — the
Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca not having issued the first instance
decision and local judicial remedies not having been exhausted.

1123.Claimants do not deny that claims for denial of justice “will only be perfected once
internal remedies are exhausted and/or justice sufficiently delayed”.°”’ But they
assert that they are not making a claim for denial of justice, their case being that
Colombia’s mere decision to file the judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment
already resulted in a breach of the of the FET standard.°*

 

The Tribunal’s Decision

1124.The matter which the Tribunal must address in order to accept or to dismiss the
Inadmissibility Objection is whether Claimants’ claims are already ripe for
adjudication, or whether under the BIT an investor is bound to perform certain
activity before being entitled to gain access to international arbitration.

1125.When the Tribunal approached the same issue regarding the Contraloria’s
Decision, it was able to rely on the guidance provided by Art. 11(3) of the Protocol.
This rule is inapposite for the present discussion: Colombia’s decision to file the
judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment does not constitute an acto
administrativo, and cannot be impugned in via gubernativa.

1126.In the absence of any specific provision in the Treaty, of any guidance in the
Protocol or any rule of general application deriving from international law, the
Tribunal finds that access to international arbitration, in situations other than those
covered by Art. 11(3) of the Protocol, is not burdened by any admissibility
requirement. Colombia adopted a measure consisting in the filing of the judicial
Procedure for Contractual Annulment; Claimants claim that this measure breached
the Treaty; the claim is admissible, there being no further requirements which have
to be complied with (whether the claim is ultimately accepted or dismissed is of
course a question for the merits).

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Lemire

1127.The tribunal in Lemire, when faced with a similar situation, reached the same
conclusion as the present Tribunal, but added the following caveat:°?

“This does not mean that an investor can come before an ICSID tribunal with
any complaint, no matter how trivial, about any decision, no matter how
routine, taken by any civil servant, no matter how modest his hierarchical
place.”

1128.In this case, however, the claim is not trivial, since it affects the validity of the
Eighth Amendment. And the decision was not taken by a modest civil servant, but
by the SGC, the agency entrusted by the Republic with the supervision of the
mining sector. The test predicated by Lemire is fully met.

Generation Ukraine
1129. Respondent has invoked Generation Ukraine to support its case.

1130.The present arbitration has significant differences with Generation Ukraine,! a
case where the claimant abandoned the country as soon as the impugned measures
were adopted and claimed that an expropriation had occurred. In the present
arbitration, the situation is quite different: Claimants are not claiming an
expropriation, and they have initiated this arbitration to ensure that they continue to
enjoy their investment.

1131.In any case, the test proposed by Generation Ukraine is based on reasonableness: a
claimant is required to put in a reasonable effort to obtain a correction of the wrong
decision within the domestic legal system, before gaining access to international
protection. In the present case, there is no reasonable measure which Claimants
could have adopted to resist or correct Colombia’s decision to file the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment.

c. Loss or Damage

1132.Art. 11(1) of the Treaty provides that an investor may request consultations, as a
preliminary step to arbitration, if the measure applied by the host State is
inconsistent with a Treaty obligation “thus causing loss or damage to him or his

investment”.

1133. Respondent argues that the measures adopted by Colombia have caused no loss or
damage to Claimants.

1134. The argument is without merit.

1135.Determination of loss and damage is a question which can only be adjudicated once
the merits of the claim have been established. In any case, Prodeco was forced to

°9 Lemire, para. 278.
1000 Generation Ukraine, para. 20.30.

237

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

pay to the Republic the Fiscal Liability Amount, as required by the Contraloria’s
Decision. Prima facie, Claimants seem to have suffered certain “loss or damage”,
and one of Claimants’ requests in this arbitration is precisely repayment of such
sum plus interest.

d. Abuse of Process

1136.Respondent finally submits that the Tribunal should decline to hear Claimants’
claims, because by trying to inhibit the operation of Colombia’s judiciary process,
an abuse of process is being committed. !°"!

1137. The Tribunal disagrees.

1138.Claimants’ claim is that certain measures adopted by Colombia’s public
administration (the Contraloria’s Decision and the filing of the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment) breached the FET standard established in the BIT. The
allegedly wrongful measures were performed by agencies of the Republic, and
allegedly breached international law guarantees afforded by the Treaty. Claimants’
allegations may be right or wrong — that is a question for the merits. But there is no
indication that Claimants committed an abuse of process which would permit an
early disposal of the claims.

1139. Respondent cites the Rompetrol award. That tribunal held the following: !°?

“The Tribunal wishes to make it plain from the outset that it would be acutely
sensitive to any well-founded allegation that the investment arbitration
process before it was intended to (or was in fact operating in such a way as to)

VI. MERITS OF THE CLAIMS

1143. The Tribunal has rejected three of Respondent’s jurisdictional and inadmissibility
objections and must now turn to the merits of Claimants’ claims.

1144. At the Hearing, Claimants described that what they seek in the present arbitration
“is very simple”: !0

“That Colombia honor its word when it signed with Prodeco a contractual
amendment which formed the incentive for a mine expansion and related
infrastructure which cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Having received the
benefit of that investment, Colombia cannot now turn its back on its solemn
contractual commitments, put on its sovereign hat, and seek to unilaterally
abrogate the rights contained in that Contract. If that were not the case, no
contract signed with a sovereign State would be worth the paper it is written
on. Such conduct is a textbook breach of the fair-and-equitable-treatment
standard.”

1145.More specifically, Claimants argue that by

- (i) starting the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and adopting the Contraloria’s
decision and

- (ii) filing the Procedure for Contractual Annulment and thereby seeking
annulment of the Eighth Amendment

Colombia failed to provide Claimants with treatment consistent with the obligations
set forth in Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. !0°

1146.Claimants also contend that Colombia has failed to observe its obligations with
regard to Claimants’ investment under Art. 10(2) of the Treaty.!°°? The Tribunal
has already ruled, however, that it does not have competence to adjudicate claims
to the extent they are grounded on the Umbrella Clause of the Treaty. °°

1147.The Tribunal will first summarize Claimants’ position (VI.1.) and then
Respondent’s position (VI.2.) before analysing the issues and setting forth the
reasons for its decision (VI.3.).

VI.1. CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

1148.Claimants explain that Art. 4(2) of the Treaty requires Colombia to accord FET to
Claimants’ investments.'°? The Treaty does not define what constitutes FET.
Claimants argue, however, that pursuant to Art. 31(1) of the VCLT, Art. 4(2) must
be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to
its terms, and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty. !°!

1149. Claimants point out that the contours of the FET standard have been developed by
investment treaty tribunals over time. For instance, in the Saluka case, 1011 the
tribunal concluded that the ordinary meaning of “fair” and “equitable” is “just”,
“even-handed”, “unbiased”, or “legitimate”. Investment tribunals have also
established that pursuant to the FET standard, the host State is required to ensure
some essential features in its investment environment: !°'?

- Protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations (1.): tribunals have held that
when the host State creates expectations in the investor, these expectations are
legitimate and are subject to protection. As held by the Total tribunal, legitimate
expectations can arise from a variety of sources, including a contract, a
concession or other commitments on which the investor is entitled to rely. !°'5

- Appropriate investment_environment_(2.): the host State must ensure an
appropriate investment environment, by treating the foreign investment in a
manner that is consistent, predictable, transparent, and not arbitrary.!0!4 As
enshrined in Art. 4(1) of the Treaty, the host State must not interfere with
investments through unreasonable or discriminatory conduct.'°!> Finally, the
State must act in accordance with the principle of good faith.''®

- Due process (3.): the host State must ensure that due process is accorded; this
entails enabling an investor to present its case and to defend itself. A breach of
due process must be objectively assessed and can occur even if there is no bias
on the part of the State.!0!7

1150.Claimants explain that the determination of “unreasonableness” or “unfairness” is
not dependent upon the State’s motivation for taking the offending measures. FET
is an objective standard that can be breached even if the State acted in good faith.!°!%

1151.Claimants submit that Colombia treated Claimants’ investment unfairly and
inequitably and impaired it through unreasonable treatment, in violation of its
obligations under the Treaty and customary international law.

(1) FRUSTRATION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

1152.According to Claimants, Colombia made specific commitments and assurances
with respect to Claimants’ investments, which generated legitimate expectations,
only then to breach those expectations. !°!?

1153.Claimants contend that the Eighth Amendment constituted Colombia’s core
commitment, and that Claimants relied upon it to invest over USD 1 billion in
Colombia since 2010. This Amendment was negotiated over a period of 20 months,
was executed by Colombia’s Mining Agency and was registered with the national
mining registry. The State Mining Agency gave three explicit commitments to
Claimants in the Eighth Amendment: '°

- That Royalties on every additional 1 MTA of coal produced beyond 8 MTA
would be subject to a marginal prorated 1% increase;

- That thresholds for the GIC payments would be indexed;

- That the Coal Reference Price for the liquidation of Royalties and GIC payments
would be established using a lagging price formula reflecting reference prices
from the previous three to eighteen months.

1154.The State Mining Agency reinforced these expectations by approving Prodeco’s
2010 PTI.

1155.Claimants argue that they legitimately expected that Colombia would honour these
contractual commitments and act consistently with the representations given to
Prodeco.!°?! Instead, through the actions of the Contraloria and the Mining Agency,
Colombia repudiated and destroyed the commitments that it had negotiated and
enshrined in the Eighth Amendment, after Claimants had made significant
investments in reliance upon said Amendment, thereby frustrating Claimants’
legitimate expectations. ©

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

A, The Contraloria’s Conduct Contravened Claimants’ Legitimate
Expectations

1156.Claimants argue that the Contraloria’s decision to initiate and conduct the Fiscal

Liability Proceeding, ultimately holding Prodeco fiscally liable, contravened
Claimants’ legitimate expectations, specifically that their investments would be
treated in a consistent, predictable, and transparent manner. 1023

1157. First, the Contraloria’s Decision revoked the State’s commitments under the Eighth

Amendment for the year 2020. Colombia did not use its fiscal control powers in
conformity with its usual function of supervising fiscal management of State
resources, but rather to nullify, in effect, the commitments made in the Eighth
Amendment. !0*4

1158.Second, the Contraloria acted unpredictably by adopting a decision which was

radically incoherent and inconsistent with the conduct of other Colombian
authorities. According to Claimants, there is no precedent for the Contraloria’s
decision to nullify an agreement with a specialized state entity concerning a large
project like Prodeco’s. Colombia also unilaterally withdrew the undertakings and
assurances it gave Claimants to incentivize the investment in the expansion of the
Mine.

1159. Third, the Contraloria applied different criteria to evaluate the Eighth Amendment

from those considered by Ingeominas when negotiating and agreeing to it. The
Contraloria also ignored that the Eighth Amendment had enabled the expansion of
the Mine and that this expansion had been the basis of the negotiation between the
parties. !76

B. The ANM’s Conduct Contravened Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations

1160.Claimants argue that the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, filed by the

SGC/ANM, also repudiated the State’s commitments under the Eighth Amendment
and breached Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

1161. This Procedure was started after Claimants, relying on the Eighth Amendment, had

made significant investments. In the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, the
Mining Agency argues that the Amendment should be nullified as being contrary
to the State’s general interest. According to Claimants, this directly contradicts the
express representations given by Ingeominas upon the execution of the Eighth
Amendment. !077

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

C. Rebuttal of Respondent’s Arguments

1162.As to Respondent’s argument that contracts do not give rise to legitimate

expectations, and that the breach of contractual expectations does not violate the
FET provision, Claimants disagree. Investment case law has consistently
recognised that contracts with a host State can give rise to legitimate
expectations. !078

1163.Claimants recognise that not all contractual breaches violate the FET standard.

Claimants argue, however, that in the present case the State did not just fail to
perform a contract that it had previously recognised as binding; it sought the
annulment of said contract. Claimants do not rely on “contractual expectations”, but
on the legitimate expectations protected under the Treaty, that Colombia generated
by assuming explicit commitments and assurances towards the Claimants. !°7

1164. Respondent also asserts that the State’s enforcement of its legal, regulatory or

(2)

control measures cannot amount to a breach of legitimate expectations. Claimants
consider this allegation to be incorrect, since the VCLT expressly provides that a
State may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure
to perform a treaty. In addition, as held by the Tecmed tribunal, a State will frustrate
an investor’s legitimate expectations if it uses its legal and regulatory powers for a
purpose other than that for which it was intended, to impair or deprive the investor
of its investment. !°°

FAILURE TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT REQUIRED BY FET

1165.Claimants further submit that Colombia has also breached the FET standard by

frustrating Claimants’ general expectation that Colombia would treat Claimants’
investment in a transparent, consistent, and predictable manner, that Colombia
would act in good faith, and that it would refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable
treatment. !°3!

1166.Claimants note that the State has to act consistently between the branches of its

government, as found in the MTD case. This means that the State as a whole must
act coherently vis-a-vis the foreign investor.'!°* Claimants argue that this did not
happen in the present case: Ingeominas executed the Eighth Amendment on the
basis that it was in the interest of the State, only for the Contraloria arbitrarily to
abrogate it on the basis of an opposite conclusion. !°**

1167.Claimants contend that these findings are also supported by the finding of the

Occidental decision, which held that confusion and lack of clarity in the actions of

an administrative agency may result in some form of arbitrariness, even if not
intended. !°¥

Claimants aver that Colombia’s agencies did not act consistently, predictably, and
in good faith, for several reasons.

A. The Contraloria’s Decision was Non-Transparent, Arbitrary and
Unreasonable

Claimants argue that the Contraloria’s Decision, which led to the reversal of the
Eighth Amendment, was non-transparent, arbitrary, unreasonable, and taken in bad
faith for several reasons. !°°5

First, the Contraloria found Prodeco guilty of negotiating and proposing the Eighth
Amendment, and of not ensuring that Ingeominas properly analysed the
consequences of the Eighth Amendment, as if Prodeco’s role was that of the
Colombian State’s supervisory guardian and not that of a contractual counterparty.
Ultimately, the Contraloria held Prodeco liable for the alleged misconduct of the
State’s mining agency. According to Claimants, holding a private company
responsible for alleged failures of a State entity to perform its duties properly is
unreasonable and arbitrary.

Second, the Contraloria’s Decision was based on the fact that several public
officers allegedly failed to fulfil their duties. The Mining Agency never investigated
any of those alleged wrongdoings, however. Only Prodeco was held liable by the
Contraloria.

Third, the Contraloria held that the Eighth Amendment was not in the State’s
interest, based on a narrow analysis of the first year of a long-term contract. This
conclusion was reached despite the Contraloria’s institutional guidelines requiring
long-term analysis of long-term contracts; here the Contraloria illogically relied on
the definition of “Transition Period” in the Mining Contract. Claimants submit that
making a short-term analysis of the operation of a long-term contract is arbitrary
and unreasonable.

Fourth, the Contraloria reached its conclusions long before issuing the Decision
and did not allow Prodeco to submit key evidence. Claimants argue that the
Contraloria’s actions involved prejudice, preference, and bias.

In particular, the Contraloria committed many procedural irregularities in blatant
disregard of Colombian law and the best practices reflected in the Contraloria’s
Evidence Manual. The Contraloria sought to manipulate the evidence so as to reach
a pre-ordained and arbitrary conclusion.

The Contraloria ignored the testimony of Ingeominas’ officers, given under oath,
that Ingeominas had properly analysed the Eighth Amendment. Instead, it relied

‘034 HT, Day 1, p. 166, 1.21 —p. 167, 1. 5.
35 C J, para. 202; CII, para. 259(d); HT, Day 1, p. 168, 1. 6 —p. 170, 1. 17.

244

Glencore International A.G. and C.1. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

almost exclusively on testimony from those same officers that contradicted their
testimony given under oath. The Contraloria seems to have rewarded the officers
who changed their testimony by dropping charges against them. Accordingly,
Claimants submit that the Contraloria’s Decision was biased, rendered in bad faith,
and subjective:

- The Contraloria did not act on the basis of legal standards, but repeatedly relied
on its own discretion and preference to justify a finding of fiscal liability against
Prodeco;

- The Contraloria exercised jurisdiction over Prodeco when it did not have such
jurisdiction;

- The Contraloria did not base its actions on reasoned judgement.

1176. Finally, the Contraloria’s Decision required Prodeco to pay the Fiscal Liability
Amount in order to avoid forfeiture of the Mining Contract as a whole. This
amounted to a unilateral and coercive attempt to rewrite the negotiated terms of the
Mining Contract. !%°

B. The State Mining Agency’s Conduct was Arbitrary, Unpredictable, and
Non-Transparent

1177.Claimants also argue that the Mining Agency has conducted itself in an
inconsistent, arbitrary, unpredictable, and non-transparent manner: 1037

- On the one hand, after 20 months of negotiations, the State Mining Agency
signed the Eighth Amendment in order to induce Claimants to make significant
investments, claiming that the Amendment was in the State’s interest because it
would allow the expansion of the Mine; it registered the Eighth Amendment
with the national mining registry, approved Prodeco’s 2010 PTI and its officers
then testified as to the benefits of the Eighth Amendment in the context of the
Fiscal Liability Proceeding;

- On the other hand, after Claimants had made massive investments to expand the
Mine, the Mining Agency, in direct contradiction with its prior conduct, sought
to annul the Eighth Amendment, arguing that it reduced Colombia’s royalty
revenues for 2010 and 2011, even though it knew that the Amendment would
bring significant benefits to the State in the medium to long term.

1178.Claimants further argue that the initiation of the Procedure for Contractual
Annulment was non-transparent and arbitrary, since the Mining Agency sought
unilaterally to withdraw the undertakings and assurances given to Claimants,
without a reasoned judgement. The Mining Agency decided to request the nullity
of the Eighth Amendment on the ground that it was not in the interest of the State,

1036 C J, para. 203.

245

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

reneging its prior representations. There was no attempt to consult with Prodeco in
good faith before taking such a drastic step. !°*

1179. In light of these actions, Claimants submit that Colombia has failed to provide them
with the investment environment required by the FET standard, in breach of Arts.
4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. !°°

C. Rebuttal of Respondent’s Arguments

1180.Claimants note that, contrary to what Respondent alleges, a State can breach the
FET standard even if the measures it took were taken in good faith, for a legitimate
purpose, and in accordance with its laws and regulations.'“° Equally, a State may
take measures which are arbitrary, even if not taken in bad faith. 04!

1181.Claimants contend that it is not necessary to establish that Colombia acted in bad
faith for this Tribunal to conclude that Colombia failed to accord FET to Claimants’
investment. If Colombia had acted in bad faith, however, that would in itself
evidence a breach of the FET.!°”

1182. Finally, Claimants admit that there is no question that Colombia has a general right
to exercise legal or regulatory review, but argue that such review, even if fully
compliant with Colombian law and conducted in good faith, must be consistent with
the international law obligation to provide FET. FET requires Colombia to act in a
consistent, predictable, and transparent manner, and to refrain from arbitrary,
unreasonable, or capricious conduct. 1043

(3) DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS

1183.Claimants submit that due process is another essential feature of the investment
environment required by the FET standard. This is an objective standard of
treatment, by which a host State’s legal and administrative system may be
judged. '°#

1184. Claimants contend that Colombia has denied Claimants due process in the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding, in two primary ways. '°4°

A. Prodeco Lacked a Proper Opportunity to Defend Itself

1185.Claimants first argue that Prodeco was denied the opportunity to present evidence
and to question witnesses, and consequently, to defend itself properly: !%°

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- The Contraloria refused to admit the oral testimony of the independent experts
presented by Prodeco, even though their testimony was directly relevant;

- The Contraloria refused to allow Prodeco to question the Contraloria’s
technical team;

- The Contraloria refused to admit the testimony of Prodeco’s employees who
had carried out the technical analyses of the proposed Eighth Amendment, which
Prodeco shared with the State’s Mining Agency during negotiations.

B. The Contraloria’s Decision was Biased
1186.Claimants submit that the Contraloria did not act in an even-handed manner in its

conduct of the proceedings. In fact, it conducted the proceedings with the aim of
reaching a pre-ordained conclusion. This is evidenced by several facts: !47

 

- The Contraloria unfairly joined to the proceedings, and attached the assets and
bank accounts of four civil servants; after those civil servants subsequently
changed their prior sworn testimony by unsworn statements, the Contraloria
released them on the grounds that their positions had not vested them with the
requisite fiscal management powers to fall under the Contraloria’s jurisdiction
in the first place; the Contraloria thus appears to have rewarded those officers
who changed their testimony;

- The Contraloria ignored testimony given under oath in Prodeco’s favour, and
relied almost exclusively on unsworn testimony that was at odds with the
testimony given under oath, but which supported the Contraloria’s charges; the
Contraloria also failed to ask questions to seek the material truth regarding these
testimonies;

- The Contraloria refused to allow Prodeco to present statements regarding the
analysis of the impact of the Eighth Amendment on the basis that it was
“superfluous”, but admitted the testimony of a witness who had already testified
multiple times before the Contraloria; in her fourth appearance, the witness
changed her testimony so as to support the charges laid by the Contraloria.

1187.Furthermore, according to Claimants, the Contraloria conducted the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding in a partial and non-transparent manner. Claimants argue that
the Contraloria and Ms. Vargas had made up their minds to find Prodeco fiscally
liable and were ready to bend applicable rules to achieve that outcome.!*
Claimants suggest that the Contraloria wanted to “clean up” the irregularities
surrounding the State Mining Agency. The Contraloria found, however, that other
Colombian authorities were competent to investigate the irregularities concerning

the Drummond and Cerro Matoso contracts, and Prodeco was the only mining
company remaining under the Contraloria’s purview. !°°

According to Claimants, Ms. Morelli suggested in an interview of December 2013
that she had already decided that Prodeco was fiscally liable.!°°° Ms. Morelli had
hand-picked Ms. Vargas to lead the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. In January 2014,
after Ms. Morelli’s declaration, Ms. Vargas rejected nearly all of Prodeco’s requests
to submit evidence. Claimants contend that both Ms. Morelli and Ms Vargas
ensured that Prodeco could not proffer exculpatory evidence that could change the
determined outcome of the case. !°5!

Finally, the Contraloria’s conduct was inconsistent with that of other State entities,
such as the State Mining Agency and the decision of the Attorney General’s
office. 1°?

Claimants conclude that this conduct, which is attributable to Colombia, destroyed
Claimants’ legitimate expectations, since Claimants saw their contractual rights
nullified in a proceeding devoid of due process. It was the exact opposite of an
even-handed and unbiased process based on appropriate and _ relevant
considerations.

C. Rebuttal of Respondent’s Arguments

Claimants note that Colombia does not dispute that a violation of due process may
breach the FET standard. Colombia argues, however, that for a breach of FET to
have occurred, the breach requires “severe bias”, “must be manifest and it must
offend judicial propriety”. Colombia adds that administrative proceedings are
subject to less demanding standards of due process than judicial proceedings. !°*

Claimants disagree. Case law cited by Claimants in their Memorial (Deutsche Bank,
Metalclad and Tecmed) independently found that the host States had failed to
provide due process in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and acted
on the basis of bias. Commentary cited by Colombia confirms that due process
reflects an objective standard of treatment, by which a host State’s “legal and

administrative system may be judged”. !°>+

Claimants further aver that Colombia’s assertions regarding the due process
standard allegedly applicable to this case are misguided, since they are based on

cases concerning denial of justice! or regulatory decision-making by
administrative agencies !°°°— not administrative adjudication. Claimants deny that

administrative proceedings are subject to less demanding standards of due process.
Claimants refer to the conclusions of the Apotex tribunal to support their
position.!°°7

According to Claimants, investment treaty case law has identified other due process
failures that can amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard,
such as “conduct [...] involv[ing] lack of due process leading to an outcome which
offends judicial propriety — as might be the case with [...] a complete lack of
transparency and candour in an administrative process”,!°* “total lack of
reasoning”!°*° or a State “disregard[ing] its own rules”. !°°
Claimants conclude, in any event, that the analysis of a potential breach of the FET
standard for failure to provide due process largely depends upon and must be
adapted to the circumstances of each specific case. 0°!

VI.2. RESPONDE POSITION

1197.Respondent argues that Claimants’ case rests on the assumption that Colombia’s
ordinary enforcement of its legal, regulatory, and control framework, which was
already in place at the time of Claimants’ investment, constitutes a breach of the
Treaty. Respondent says that, essentially, Claimants’ position is that: !°°

- Claimants should not be subject to Colombia’s ordinary control regime because
“a large project like the Calenturitas mine” somehow deserves special treatment;

- Any review of the Eighth Amendment by an organ of the Colombia State,
whether the Contraloria or the courts, constitutes a breach of international law.

1198. According to Respondent, if Claimants’ position were true, any state action to
enforce its legal, regulatory, and control framework would constitute a breach of
the FET or non-impairment clauses. '°°' Respondent argues that foreign investors
are not immunized from enforcement of domestic laws and regulations, !°°
especially not sophisticated multinational businesses such as Claimants, who knew
about the Colombian legal, regulatory, and control environment. !%

1199. Thus, Respondent submits that Colombia’s ordinary and reasonable actions in the
Fiscal Liability Proceeding and in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment could
not and did not breach Arts. 4(1) or 4(2) of the Treaty. °°

Preliminary issue: new claims

1200.Respondent argues that in the Reply, Claimants have matched the various legal
standards identified in the initial Memorial, with facts, and produced a largely new
constellation of claims. These new claims include Claimants’ allegations that: !°°*

- The Contraloria’s Decision was inconsistent, unpredictable, and
non-transparent;

- The Contraloria’s Decision unreasonably withdrew the undertakings and
assurances that Claimants had received;

- The Contraloria’s Decision was not reasoned; and

- Mr. Paredes did not consult with Prodeco prior to initiating the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

.According to Respondent, all of Claimants’ new allegations in the Reply are

inadmissible, since ICSID Rule 31 establishes that the proper time to make
allegations of fact and law is in the Memorial. Since Claimants’ new allegations are
untimely, they must be disregarded pursuant to ICSID Rule 26(3). Failure to do so
would be contrary to Colombia’s right to have two opportunities to respond with
evidence. !°

. Respondent also argues that all of Claimants’ allegations made in the Memorial that

Claimants chose not to defend in the Reply must also be rejected, since it would be
contrary to Colombia’s procedural rights if Claimants were now allowed to
introduce further arguments in defence of these claims, following their failure to do
so in the Reply.!°”

In any event, Respondent considers that Claimants’ case must fail since: !°”!

- Colombia acted in full compliance with Claimants’ alleged legitimate
expectations at all times (1);

- The Contraloria’s Decision and the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, as
ordinary regulatory and control measures, satisfied all requirements of the FET

and impairment clauses (2);

- The conduct of the Contraloria in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding fully respected
any relevant standard of due process (3); and

- Respondent finally adds that there was no violation of FET or of the impairment
clauses on account of the ANDJE’s submission of the Criminal Complaint.

No BREACH OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

. Respondent notes that the concept of legitimate expectations does not appear in the

terms of the Treaty and that Claimants have not explained how it could fall within
the ordinary meaning of FET.'°” Even if customary international law should be
taken into account when interpreting the ordinary meaning of a Treaty term,
according to customary international law, FET does not cover legitimate
expectations. !°7

-Respondent avers that even if the FET clause extended protection to legitimate

expectations, Claimants’ allegations would be no more availing, for two
reasons: !°”

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- First, because the allegations of a breach of FET are found solely on contractual
expectations, and these cannot give rise to a Treaty breach (A.);

- Second, because any expectations that Claimants might have had from the
Eighth Amendment must have included the possibility that Colombia would
subject that contract to ordinary measures to enforce its legal and regulatory
framework (B.).

A. No Breach of Mere Contractual Expectations

1206.Respondent says that Claimants’ legitimate expectations arise directly from the
Eighth Amendment and the contractual obligations it allegedly contained.
However, contractual expectations are not protected by the FET clause of the
Treaty. !07

1207. First, Respondent argues that an FET clause is not an umbrella clause, which would
elevate any contractual breach into a Treaty breach.!°"° According to Respondent,
Prof. Schreuer has established that if contractual expectations were admitted, the
FET standard would be a broadly interpreted umbrella clause. !°7”

1208. Respondent says that a FET clause cannot be a broadly interpreted umbrella clause.
That is even more so in a Treaty which contains an Umbrella Clause but excludes
the Tribunal’s competence to adjudicate disputes under said Clause. !07*

1209. According to Respondent, these conclusions are confirmed by the SAUR tribunal
and the line of decisions of which it forms a part, including Parkering-Compagniets,
Hamester, Bayindir, and Impregilo.'°” Similarly, the UAB tribunal rejected a claim
for breach of FET on the ground that it was a contractual claim, brought under the
veil of a breach of the investor’s legitimate expectations. !°°°

1210.Second, Respondent holds that investors do not enjoy an unconditional right to legal
or contractual stability absent a stabilization clause.'°*! Respondent recognizes that
many investments are made through the vehicle of contracts. Yet Respondent
argues, it does not follow that contractual expectations are the fundamental basis of
FET claims in every international arbitration. !°°*

1211.Finally, Respondent finds that the case law invoked by Claimants — namely the
Noble Ventures, and Murphy decisions — does not support the argument that

virtually every foreign investment and investment claim is based on a breach of
contractual expectations. !°?

1212.Respondent concludes that since Claimants have not put forth any supposed
legitimate expectation other than the contractual expectations arising from the
Eighth Amendment, Claimants do not have a claim under the FET standard. !°8+
Indeed, the Eighth Amendment did not give rise to any expectations entitled to
Treaty protection. !°8>

B. No Breach Through Ordinary Legal, Regulatory and Control Measures

1213.Respondent maintains, in any event, that the investor’s expectations (if any) must
include the possibility that the State will enforce its legal and regulatory
framework. !%

1214. According to Respondent, not every ordinary measure of regulatory or legal
enforcement carried out against a foreign investor can be considered to be an FET
breach. If legitimate expectations exist at all, they must take into account the entire
legal and regulatory framework of the State, including any ordinary review
mechanisms, as well as the broader economic and social context in which the
expectations were formed. These conclusions are supported by the Total and
Roussalis tribunals.'°°7

1215.Respondent notes that Claimants rely on the ECE decision to try to demonstrate that
they legitimately expected that the Colombian authorities would refrain from
implementing the legal and regulatory framework. However, the ECE tribunal
rejected the proposition that an administrative decision, even an erroneous one, can
breach legitimate expectations. !°**

1216. Respondent further submits that, since investors should not be treated by investment
tribunals as if they were legally incapable, Claimants are presumed to have known
the contents of the Colombian legal and regulatory system when investing in
Colombia.'°”

1217. Respondent finds that Claimants’ argument pursuant to which the VCLT precludes
Colombia from invoking the provisions of its internal law to justify a breach of the
Treaty is unavailing. Respondent does not argue that its internal law is a
circumstance that justifies or precludes the wrongfulness of the alleged Treaty
breach. Colombia’s argument is that the FET provision of the Treaty, when properly

interpreted, cannot preclude the State parties from the ordinary enforcement of their
legal and regulatory frameworks. !°”°

1218.Respondent stresses that its argument is that an investor can have no legitimate
expectation that the State will refrain from reasonable enforcement of its legal and
regulatory framework, not that the State is exempted from a duty to respect
legitimate expectations (although Colombia denies that any such duty is part of the
FET standard). !%!

1219. Respondent thus submits that it did not breach Claimants’ expectations, because it
merely took ordinary measures to enforce its legal and regulatory framework. !°°?

The Fiscal Liability Proceeding was an Ordinary Measure

1220.Respondent submits that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding was an ordinary legal and
regulatory enforcement measure, which did not breach Claimants’ legitimate
expectations. Proceedings of fiscal liability are common within the Colombian legal
framework and in other frameworks across Latin America. Claimants have
submitted no evidence that they had expectations that they would not be subject to
a review by the Contraloria. !°

1221.In a 234-page long reasoned decision, the Contraloria found that Prodeco’s actions
satisfied all of the elements of fiscal liability, namely that it had exercised “gestidn
fiscal’ over public resources and had contributed through the Eighth Amendment
to the “lesidn a los intereses del Estado” .\°°

1222. According to Respondent, the Contraloria’s Decision was correctly based on two
premises: !

- First, that under Colombian law, the exploitation of non-renewable natural
resources cannot be dissociated from the royalties that the private contractor has
to pay to the State as consideration; this is why the Contraloria found that
Prodeco was a fiscal manager of public goods;

- Second, that the Contraloria may initiate Fiscal Liability Proceeding against
anyone who directly causes or contributes to damage to the public patrimony of
the State; this is why the Contraloria made a reasoned judgement and concluded
that it has jurisdiction over Prodeco.

1223.Respondent submits that even if it were true (which it is not) that Prodeco had no
“decision-making power” over royalties and compensation, the Contraloria would
nevertheless have had jurisdiction. Its jurisdiction extends not only to those who

exercise “gestidn fiscal” but also to those who contribute to harming to the public
patrimony of the State “con ocasién de la gestion fiscal” .!°°°

1224. Respondent says that, in any event, according to the ECE tribunal, it is not the role
of an international tribunal to sit on appeal against the legal correctness or
substantive reasonableness of individual administrative acts.!°7

Procedure for Contractual Annulment was an Ordinary Measure

1225.Respondent argues that a state action before the courts to nullify a state contract is
equally foreseeable in Colombian legislation and practice. The Procedure for
Contractual Annulment involved ordinary legal recourse to the courts to review
state contracts and so could not be contrary to Claimants’ legitimate
expectations. !0°8

1226. Absent actions tantamount to denial of justice, it is no breach of FET to submit a
contract for nullification, as follows from the Azinian tribunal’s conclusions.!°
According to Respondent, this is simply the application of the general principle that
domestic courts are competent to decide on questions of domestic law, absent a
denial of justice. !!°°

1227.In any event, Respondent argues that the Procedure for Contractual Annulment
could be expected under Colombian law and therefore could not breach Claimants’
legitimate expectations. Claimants do not deny that Colombian law, as most legal
systems do, provides for the absolute nullity of a contract that is found to be contrary
to mandatory law; and it permits the counterparty to a contract, whether the State
or the private individual, to seek a declaration of its absolute nullity before the
courts, 110!

1228.Respondent submits that pursuant to the Colombian Code of Administrative
Procedure, either party to a state contract (such as the Mining Contract) is expressly
entitled to request a declaration of its absolute nullity. And Claimants have failed
to deny that the Eighth Amendment would be null if it was contrary to Art. 84 of
the 1988 Mining Code, which provides for equitable remuneration in exchange for
mining rights. !!°?

1229.Finally, Respondent notes that only after the State Mining Agency sought
conciliation of the controversy did it initiate its actions before the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca. The decision was taken after the Mining Agency
was informed by the Contraloria that the Eighth Amendment had reduced the

income under the Mining Contract and that the necessary studies had not been
performed. |!

1230.In sum, Respondent says that there is no substance to the complaint that either the
Fiscal Liability Proceeding or the Procedure for Contractual Annulment breached
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations. !!

(2) COLOMBIA TOOK ORDINARY LEGAL, REGULATORY AND CONTROL MEASURES

1231.Respondent also contests Claimants’ allegations of arbitrariness, unreasonableness,
or non-transparent conduct.

A. The Contraloria’s Decision was Consistent, Predictable, and
Transparent

1232. Preliminarily, Respondent reiterates its position that Claimants’ arguments that the
Contraloria’s Decision was inconsistent, unpredictable, and non-transparent are
inadmissible because they were advanced in an untimely manner. But even if
Claimants’ belated arguments were admissible, Respondent considers that they
should be unsuccessful. !!°5

1233.According to Respondent, the enforcement of the existing legal and regulatory
framework can be inconsistent, unpredictable, and non-transparent only when it is
arbitrary and unreasonable. '!!°° Respondent points out that Claimants are unable to
define, much less to prove, when an ordinary enforcement measure is inconsistent,
unpredictable, or non-transparent. In each of the cases cited by Claimants (Lemire,
MTD, Crystallex) the enforcement actions were found to be inconsistent, non-
predictable, and non-transparent only because the actions had been arbitrary or
unreasonable. !!°7

1234. Respondent explains that the UAB tribunal recently held that actions to enforce laws
and regulations do not violate the requirements of stability and predictability.!!°°
Similarly, Respondent maintains that as the Unglaube tribunal concluded,
investment tribunals should defer to state measures taken in furtherance of valid
public policies, in the present case expressed in the legal and regulatory
framework. !!°

1235.According to Respondent, Claimants have left unaddressed and unrebutted
Colombia’s actual positions, having instead relied on an inaccurate account of
Colombia’s position:!!!°

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

- Colombia’s position is that, whenever an ordinary enforcement action is
consistent with the legal and regulatory framework, it is consistent, predictable,
and transparent;

- Contrary to what Claimants say, Colombia does not try to justify failure to
perform the Treaty; instead, it argues that the Treaty does not and cannot require
a State to refrain from enforcement actions consistent with its legal and
regulatory framework (unless arbitrary or unreasonable);

- Colombia does not argue that the FET standard includes only protections against
arbitrary actions; it argues that consistency, predictability, and transparency
standards, when applied to state enforcement actions, do not and cannot require
more than reasonable and non-arbitrary conduct.

1236. According to Respondent, the relevant test to determine whether the Contraloria’s
Decision was predictable and consistent is to determine whether it acted in accord
with the applicable legal and regulatory framework. And Respondent says it did.
The fact that the Contraloria may have reached a different conclusion from other
state authorities and based this decision on criteria of fiscal control is no indication
of wrongdoing. It simply means that the Contraloria was doing its job.!!"!

1237.Respondent notes, in addition, that the officials from Ingeominas never represented
that the Contraloria would refrain from reviewing the Eighth Amendment pursuant
to its criteria for fiscal review.!!!? This review was entirely predictable (as well as
coherent, consistent, and transparent) given the Colombian legal and regulatory
framework. Given that Prodeco’s actions caused illicit harm to state income, it was
predictable that it would be subject to Fiscal Liability Proceeding. '!!*

1238.Respondent submits that it was also predictable that the Contraloria would evaluate
the Eighth Amendment as it did. The Colombian legal framework permitted the
Contraloria to analyse the economic effects of the Transition Period under the
Eighth Amendment. Prodeco failed to prove an expansion of the Mine and
consequent higher revenues. Nor had Ingeominas prepared a prior viability report
on the potential future benefits from the Eighth Amendment, leaving it
unestablished whether production levels would, in fact, increase, as Prodeco
claimed.'!'4

1239. As to the lack of pursuit of officers by the Mining Agency, Respondent argues that
this is irrelevant. The Contraloria held some of Ingeominas’ decision-makers
fiscally liable. And the Prosecutor, without questioning the Contraloria’s Decision,
concluded that the facts underlying the fiscal liability did not rise to the level of
criminal action (although he did not have access to the Disputed Documents).!!!5

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1240.In_ sum, Respondent argues that the Contraloria’s Decision was consistent,
predictable, and transparent with the legal and regulatory framework and the actions
of other state entities.

B. The Contraloria’s Decision was Transparent, Non-Arbitrary,
Reasonable and Afforded Due Process

1241.Respondent contends that the standard for demonstrating arbitrary, unreasonable,
or capricious conduct is a very high one, requiring a demonstration of conduct that
shocks or surprises a sense of judicial propriety, as is clear from the conclusions of
the Crystallex tribunal.!!'°

1242. Respondent also points to the Lemire decision, in which that tribunal found that an
arbitrary action substitutes “prejudice, preference or bias” “for the rule of law”. And
put together, an action is arbitrary or unreasonable if its prejudice, preference or
bias shocks or surprises a sense of juridical propriety.!!!”

1243. According to Respondent, it is difficult to discharge the burden of proving this.
Arbitrariness is especially difficult to prove when, as observed by the Cargill
tribunal,'!'® jt requires the second-guessing of state legal, regulatory, or control
measures. Respondent says that the recent Cervin award further confirms that an
application of the national normative framework is arbitrary only if it constitutes a
deliberate repudiation of that framework, and even then, only if there are no
domestic means available to correct that application. !!!

1244. According to Respondent, Claimants had an obligation to prove prejudice,
preference or bias that shocks or surprises a sense of judicial propriety, in order to
determine that Respondent’s conduct was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.
Yet, Claimants failed to do so. By any standard, the Fiscal Liability Proceeding
were transparent, reasonable, and non-arbitrary.!!?°

1245.First, Claimants argue that Colombia unilaterally withdrew the undertakings and
assurances it had given Claimants to incentivize an investment in the Mine. This is
nothing more than a repackaging of Claimants’ arguments on legitimate
expectations. As the Fiscal Liability Proceeding did not breach any such legitimate
expectations, they were not unreasonable. !!?!

1246. Second, Respondent submits that it is false that the Contraloria did not act based
on legal standards, but instead relied on its own discretion. Prodeco’s conduct with
respect to the Eighth Amendment was within the Contraloria’s jurisdiction. In

‘416 R I, para. 447; R Il, paras. 661-662, referring to Crystallex, para. 577; HT, Day 2, p. 514, 1. 19 — p. 515,

258

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

addition, Respondent argues that the Contraloria was legally permitted to focus its
analysis on the economic effects of the Eighth Amendment’s Transition Period. The
economic terms for the Transition Period were not supported by any legal or
economic justification. The appropriateness of relying on this period is confirmed
by the fact that Prodeco did not provide evidence of a significant expansion of the
Mine.'!”? In any event, the Tribunal cannot second-guess the economic reasoning
of the Contraloria’s Decision.'!”3

1247. Third, Respondent finds that Claimants wrongly alleges that the Contraloria failed
to base its actions on reasoned judgement. This argument should be dismissed
because it is untimely. In any event, it is frivolous. The Fiscal Liability Proceeding
concluded after a four-year proceeding that generated a record that is 4349 pages
long. The Contraloria issued several reasoned evidentiary decisions. The
Contraloria’s Decision was a 234-page document, with detailed and careful factual
and legal analysis. Claimants do not dispute that the Contraloria did provide
reasoning; they seem simply to disagree with the substance of that reasoning. !!74

1248. Fourth, Claimants’ allegation that the Contraloria was biased for its refusal to hear
witness evidence, or that it reached conclusions before issuing the Decision, is
unavailing. The Contraloria did not breach international or domestic norms when
it excluded some of Prodeco’s proposed evidence on a reasoned basis and in
accordance with applicable evidentiary rules. The Colombian Supreme Court
ultimately upheld all of the Contraloria’s evidentiary determinations. !!>

1249. Even if the Contraloria had formed preliminary views at the time of its evidentiary
decision, it hardly follows that it was biased or prejudged the matter. According to
Respondent, it is normal for an adjudicator to form preliminary views during the
course of a proceeding, especially when such proceeding lasts for three years.!!?°

1250. Finally, Respondent notes that Prodeco was not held liable for failure to act as the
Colombian state’s supervisor, but for its own conduct in negotiating the Eighth
Amendment.!!?7

1251.Respondent also notes that in the Reply, Claimants seem to have abandoned their
argument in the Memorial that the Contraloria’s Decision was made in bad faith
because it “required Prodeco to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount [...] in order to
avoid the forfeiture of the Mining Contract as a whole”. Having abandoned this
argument, Claimants should not be permitted to resuscitate it in the future.!!?8

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

C. The Procedure for Contractual Annulment is Consistent, Predictable
and Transparent

Respondent claims that it is no breach of the applicable FET standard for a state to
submit a contract to its courts for review and possible annulment, unless such an
ordinary action were arbitrary or unreasonable. '!”° Respondent argues that none of
the Claimants’ allegations about the Procedure for Contractual Annulment can
succeed.

First, Respondent notes that the core of Claimants’ complaint is that the Mining
Agency entered into the Eighth Amendment and then subsequently sought to have
it annulled. This is nothing else than a restatement that the Mining Agency violated
Claimants’ legitimate expectations. !!°

In any event, the mere fact of concluding a contract cannot make it unfair and
inequitable to subsequently seek annulment of that contract, especially for a
counterparty that discovers a ground for nullity. The same applies to state contracts.
The Colombian legislation allows state contracts to be submitted to the courts for
review and possible annulment.!'3!

In addition, Respondent argues that there was a fundamental change of
circumstances between the moment when the Eighth Amendment was concluded
and when the Mining Agency submitted it to the courts for annulment: the
Contraloria had commenced its Fiscal Liability Proceeding, and found that there
was a harm to the state income. It was on this basis that the Mining Agency
challenged the validity of the Amendment. !!**

Second, Claimants’ allegations that the Mining Agency failed to base its actions on
a reasoned judgement should also be dismissed. The Mining Agency based its
decision on evidence from the Contraloria that the Eighth Amendment had reduced
state income and had not been subject to proper economic and technical studies.!'**

 

Third, Respondent contests Claimants’ argument that the Mining Agency failed to
consult with Prodeco prior to submitting the Eighth Amendment to the courts for
annulment. The Mining Agency had no obligation to consult Prodeco. The
Swisslion tribunal considered that the failure to engage the investor in and of itself
was not sufficient to constitute a breach of FET.''™

In any event, the Mining Agency commenced a formal conciliation procedure
before the Procuraduria. During this procedure, the parties met to discuss a
settlement, but to no avail. 135

In sum, Respondent argues that the actions of the State Mining Agency were
entirely reasonable under the circumstances. !!°

THE FISCAL LIABILITY PROCEEDING RESPECTED DUE PROCESS

Respondent notes that Claimants allege that the Contraloria conducted the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding without according due process to Claimants, because of its
treatment of evidence, the inclusion of civil servants in the proceedings and its bias.
According to Respondent, none of these allegations make out a breach of
international due process.!!>”

Respondent says that the international due process standard is clear: FET is
breached only by a “manifest disrespect of due process that [...] offend[s] a sense
of judicial propriety”.''** Respondent submits that the high standard applies
whether or not reference is made to denial of justice. !!°°

Respondent further argues that it is particularly difficult for administrative
proceedings to breach the due process standard. According to Respondent,
Claimants have not been able to deny this proposition.''4? Respondent submits that
it is perfectly logical that administrative due process is less demanding than judicial
due process, since administrative proceedings are designed to be more agile and
efficient and are typically subject to subsequent review by courts. This was
confirmed by the Thunderbird tribunal,''*! cited with approval by the Cervin, Philip
Morris, and Convial Callao tribunals.!'4?

In addition, Respondent notes that Claimants have appealed the Contraloria’s
Decision and are actively pursuing its annulment before the Colombian
administrative courts. The Colombian courts are positioned to correct any
deviations from Colombian procedural norms applicable to the Fiscal Liability
Proceeding. !!43

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

A. Breach of Due Process for Rejecting Evidence

1264. Respondent finds that Claimants’ argument, according to which the Contraloria
breached due process because it did not allow Prodeco to submit additional
evidence, is false.!!4

1265. Respondent says that Claimants had extensive opportunities to present evidence and
question witnesses during the four years of the proceeding, and that they took
advantage of these opportunities. According to Respondent, the applicable standard
requires that Claimants demonstrate a complete lack of any opportunity to present
evidence or to question witnesses, or otherwise a severe bias, and Claimants have
failed to demonstrate any of these elements of breach.!!4>

1266. Even cases invoked by Claimants (Deutsche Bank, Metalclad, Tecmed) found that
due process was only breached when there was a complete lack of opportunity to
be heard. !!46

1267.In sum, the administrative due process standard is breached only when there is a
complete lack of any opportunity to present evidence or question witnesses.
Respondent submits that it granted Claimants extensive opportunities to argue, to
present evidence, and even to challenge the Contraloria’s Decision over the course
of a multiyear process:!!47

- Prodeco made at least seven distinct written submissions (and multiple oral
submissions) to the Contraloria during the Fiscal Liability Proceeding; at least
four of these were made after the Contraloria filed formal charges on August
2013;

- Prodeco submitted extensive evidence into the record of the Fiscal Liability
Proceeding, including witness testimony, expert reports, and technical opinions.

1268.As to Claimants’ complaint that the Contraloria did not admit into the record a
handful of additional pieces of evidence, Respondent notes that the Contraloria
admitted Claimants’ proffered testimony from Ms. Natalia Amaya and declined to
admit the rest of the new evidence in an extensively reasoned decision from 2014.
These reasons included that the requests were legally impermissible, lacked legal
basis, or were manifestly superfluous. In any event, Respondent finds that for an
administrative adjudication to reject some, but not all, evidentiary submissions in a
reasoned decision, does not violate international law.!'48

  

1269. Respondent further notes that, at Prodeco’s request, the Colombian Supreme Court
reviewed and upheld the Contraloria’s reasoned decision on evidence, finding that

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Prodeco had been granted a proper opportunity to present evidence. The Supreme
Court’s judgment definitively establishes that the Contraloria’s evidentiary
decision was legal and correct under Colombian law. It also definitively buries
Claimants’ allegation of violation of due process. !'4?

Finally, Respondent avers that Claimants’ reliance on the so-called Contraloria’s
Evidence Manual is unavailing, since this manual did not even exist at the time of
the Contraloria’s evidentiary determination (and was rejected as legally erroneous
shortly after its enactment).!!*°

B. No breach of Due Process for Joining Public Servants to the
Proceedings

Respondent argues that it is untrue that due process was breached by the
Contraloria’s decision to join four civil servants as defendants in the proceeding
and to attach their assets. !!5!

Respondent explains that the initial statements of the Ingeominas’ officials were
ordered at the request of Mr. Ceballos, who was a defendant in the Fiscal Liability
Proceeding. During these statements, the officials made extensive reference to the
Viability Report as justification for the conclusion of the Eighth Amendment. These
four officials were subsequently joined to the Proceeding because they had authored
the Viability Report. Indeed, the Contraloria determined that the Viability Report
contained a poor and unsubstantiated feasibility analysis, referred to no other
official documents for support, and contradicted prior reports that recommended
against accepting the Eighth Amendment. All this indicated that the officials had
possibly contributed to patrimonial harm to Colombia, which was sufficient to
satisfy the standard under Colombian law to join them as defendants in the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding. !!*?

Respondent submits that the mere fact of consolidating proceedings does not breach
the international due-process standard.''** Respondent asserts that Claimants’
additional arguments should also be dismissed:

- Contrary to Claimants’ assertions, the Contraloria did not fail to ask questions

to seek the truth regarding the officials’ testimonies; Law 610 of 2000 requires
that anyone potentially subject to fiscal liability must be permitted to provide a
“libre y espontdnea” declaration, which is what the Contraloria allowed them
to do; 154

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

- Before this arbitration, Claimants had never argued that the Contraloria relied
only on unsworn statements which were prejudicial for Prodeco;

-  Inany event, the Contraloria did not base its decision to hold Prodeco liable on
the statements of the Ingeominas’ officers, but rather on extensive documentary
evidence; the statement of Ms. Aristizabal, for instance, is not once mentioned
in the section of the Contraloria’s Decision on Prodeco’s liability; as to the
limited references in the Contraloria’s Decision to the other three officials’
statements, these were not the basis of the decision. 155

1274. Respondent concludes that Claimants’ allegations concerning the Contraloria’s
treatment of evidence lack merit.!!*°

C. Absence of Bias

1275.Respondent notes that Claimants allege that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding were
carried out “in a partial and non-transparent manner” and “‘in bad faith in order to
reach its desired result [...]”. Respondent considers that Claimants appear to be
saying that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding breached due process as a result of
bias.

1276.Colombia explains that “severe bias is necessary to breach the due process strand
of the FET clause” and Claimants have failed to show any bias at all, much less
severe bias. !!°8

1277.Respondent contends that it is impossible to infer any bias from the Contraloria’s
actions: the Contraloria exercised jurisdiction over Prodeco in accordance with
Colombian law principles, conducted the Proceeding consistently with both
international and domestic procedural norms, and determined in a reasoned decision
applying the relevant law and regulations that the Transition Period of the Eighth
Amendment was unlawful. There is no bias in these ordinary and legal actions.!!°°

1278.Respondent notes that Claimants’ primary argument for bias is that the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding were in such gross violation of Colombian law that it could
not be explained except by a conspiracy to “get” Prodeco. Yet, Claimants have
failed to satisfy their burden of proof in respect of this contention.!'

1279. Respondent finds that Claimants’ accusations against Ms. Morelli and Ms. Vargas
are devoid of any substance; the only evidence to which Claimants point is the other
alleged breaches of due process that the Contraloria supposedly committed.!!°!
Respondent avers that Claimants’ made-for-arbitration argument that the Fiscal

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Liability Proceeding was in fact a conspiracy against them by Ms. Morelli and Ms.
Vargas makes no sense: !!©?

- Ms. Morelli is a prominent and respected Colombian lawyer who has also sat as
an arbitrator in three different ICSID proceedings; Ms. Vargas is an
accomplished lawyer and public servant in her own right;

- Ms. Morelli was not even working at the Contraloria when the Contraloria
Decision was issued on 30 April 2015;

- Ms. Vargas had not yet become involved in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding at
the time when the Ingeominas’ civil servants were joined to the Proceeding;

- Ms. Morelli’s declarations in December 2013 prove nothing; by that time, the
Contraloria had already issued formal charges against Prodeco.

1280. Respondent submits that, in any event, false conspiracy theories cannot satisfy the

international standard for a due process breach, which is very high.!!

1281.In sum, Respondent submits that Claimants have concocted a conspiracy against

them in order to give a modicum of plausibility to their claims of bias. But the
conspiracy theory is implausible and no breach of due process can be found on this
basis. 1!

VI.3. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

1282. Claimants argue that Colombia breached its international law obligations assumed
under Arts. 4 (1) and 4(2) of the Treaty by adopting two measures:

- the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, instituted by the Contraloria and resolved in the
Contraloria’s Decision, which declared that Prodeco, by executing the Eighth
Amendment, had incurred fiscal liability, and

- the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, filed by SGC/ANM (Ingeominas’
successors) against Prodeco with the Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,
seeking annulment of the Eighth Amendment.

1283. The Republic denies any wrongdoing.

1284. The Tribunal will first consider Respondent’s procedural objections (1) and then
will devote separate subchapters to the alleged responsibility of Colombia resulting
from the actions of the Contraloria (2) and those of the SGC/ANM (3).

(1) RESPONDENT’S PROCEDURAL OBJECTIONS

1285.Respondent argues that in the Reply Claimants rewrote “the claims previously
presented”!!®.

1286.Respondent submits that Claimants introduced the following untimely new
allegations:

- The claim that the Contraloria’s Decision was inconsistent, unpredictable, and
non-transparent;

- The claim that the Contraloria’s Decision unreasonably withdrew the
undertakings and assurances Claimants had received;

- The claim that the Contraloria’s Decision was not reasoned; and

- The factual allegation that Mr. Paredes did not consult with Prodeco before
initiating the Mining Agency Proceedings.

1287.Respondent further argues that those new claims are inadmissible, because ICSID
Rule 31 establishes that the proper time to make allegations of fact and law is in the
Memorial. Claimants’ new allegations are untimely and must be disregarded
pursuant to ICSID Rule 26(3). Failure to do so would be contrary to Colombia’s
rights to have two opportunities to respond with evidence. !!°°

1288. Respondent also argues that all of Claimants’ allegations from the Memorial that
Claimants chose not to defend in the Reply must also be rejected, since it would be

266

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

contrary to Colombia’s procedural rights if Claimants were now allowed to
introduce further arguments in defence of these claims, following their failure to do
so in the Reply.!!©7

ICSID Rules
1289. ICSID Rule 31 establishes the content of the parties’ main pleadings:
“Rule 31- The Written Procedure

“(1) In addition to the request for arbitration, the written procedure shall
consist of the following pleadings, filed within time limits set by the Tribunal:

(a) a memorial by the requesting party;
(b) a counter-memorial by the other party;
and, if the parties so agree or the Tribunal deems it necessary:
(c) a reply by the requesting party; and
(d) a rejoinder by the other party.
LJ
(3) A memorial shall contain: a statement of the relevant facts; a statement of
law; and the submissions. A counter-memorial, reply or rejoinder shall contain
an admission or denial of the facts stated in the last previous pleading; any
additional facts, if necessary; observations concerning the statement of law in
the last previous pleading; a statement of law in answer thereto; and the
submissions”.

1290. And ICSID Rule 26(3) provides as follows:
“Rule 26 — Time Limits
LJ
(3) Any step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be
disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the

other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise”.

1291.In Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties agreed on the presentation of two rounds of
pleadings.

Discussion

1292.Respondent’s objection is dismissed for being totally devoid of merit.

497 R TL, para. 587.

267

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1293. The objection is presented in a confusing manner: Respondent first complained that
in the Reply Claimants submitted new claims, but later appeared to limit its
complaint to Claimants’ introduction of new legal and factual allegations.

1294. First, Respondent says that in their Reply Claimants introduced new claims with
regard to FET and impairment.

1295.That is not so: Claimants’ claims with regard to FET and impairment in the
Memorial and in the Reply are identical.''®* There is also no indication that
Claimants have abandoned any claim.
1296.In a surprising contradiction, Respondent itself admits in the Rejoinder (the same
document in which the procedural objection is argued) that in their essence
Claimants’ claims have not changed between Memorial and Reply:!!©
“The heart of Claimants’ case in the Reply remains the same as it was in the
Memorial. Claimants complain that Colombia breached FET and impairment
clauses of the Treaty because it failed to refrain from enforcing its legal and

regulatory framework in the ordinary manner.” [Emphasis added]

1297.Second, Respondent additionally submits that Claimants introduced in their Reply
three legal allegation and one factual allegation, which (Respondent says) are new,
thus breaching ICSID Rule 31(3).

1298. The Tribunal disagrees.
1299. Even if the four allegations were new, as Respondent submits, the introduction of
those allegations in Claimants’ Reply would not constitute a breach of ICSID Rule

3103).

1300. ICSID Rule 31(3) defines on broad terms the content of a reply memorial. The Rule
provides that a reply “shall contain”:

- an admission or denial of the facts stated in the last previous pleading,
- any additional facts,

- observations on the statement of law in the last previous pleading,

- statements of law in answer thereto, and

- submissions.

1301.The three legal and one factual allegation impugned by Respondent fit within the
scope of a reply memorial, as authorized by ICSID Rule 31(3),

1168 © ], para. 310 and C II para. 375; there is no difference regarding the merits claims; differences relate
to the amounts of compensation claimed and the applicable interest rate.

268

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

- because the legal allegations constitute “observations concerning the statement
of law” in Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, or “statement of law” in answer to
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, and

- because the factual allegation fits within the category of “additional facts”.

(2) THE ALLEGED RESPONSIBILITY OF COLOMBIA ARISING OUT OF CONDUCT OF
THE CONTRALORIA

1302.Claimants argue that the Contraloria treated Claimants’ investment unfairly and
inequitably, in violation of the FET standard, and impaired such investment through
unreasonable measures, resulting in a breach by Colombia of its obligations under
Arts. 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty.!!7°

1303.Art. 4(1) of the Treaty requires Colombia to refrain from impairing the
management, use, enjoyment and expansion of Claimants’ investments through
unreasonable or discriminatory measures: !!7!

“Each Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance
with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Party and shall not
impair by unreasonable_or_ discriminator the

maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, should it so happen,
liquidation of such investments”. [Emphasis added]

1304. Art. 4(2) imposes a second obligation. Colombia must accord fair and equitable
treatment [already defined as “FET”] within its territory to the investments of Swiss
investors: !!7

“Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the
investments of investors of the other Party. [...] .”

1305. Art. 4(2) provides an additional rule: the FET treatment must not be less favourable
than the treatment granted to investments made by Colombian investors, or by
investors of the most favoured nation, if this latter treatment is more favourable.
Since Claimants do not allege a violation of this rule, it is unnecessary for the
Tribunal to discuss it further.

1306.The Tribunal will separately analyse the claims that, through the conduct of the
Contraloria, Respondent breached the FET obligation imposed by Art. 4(2) (2.1)
and adopted unreasonable measures in violation of Art. 4(1) (2.2).

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

(2.1) BREACH OF THE FET STANDARD

1307. Art. 4 of the Treaty is headed “Protection and treatment”. Paragraph (2) of Art. 4

simply says that each State party “shall ensure fair and equitable treatment” to
protected investments.

1308. Absent any further guidance from the Treaty itself, it is generally accepted that the

obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment (FET) contained in a treaty is a
requirement that host States abide by a certain standard of conduct vis-a-vis
protected investors. The fair and equitable standard is a legal concept which, though
typically not further defined, has a content that can be established by the rules of
interpretation of the VCLT, aided by the jurisprudence of international tribunals. A
host State breaches such minimum standard and incurs international responsibility
if its actions (or in certain circumstances omissions) violate certain thresholds of
propriety or contravene basic requirements of the rule of law, causing harm to the
investor.!!73

1309. The obligation to provide FET binds the State, and accordingly can be breached by

the conduct of any branch of government. In principle, then, the FET standard can
be breached inter alia

- By the executive or administrative branch or its separate agencies, by means of
administrative acts that directly target the investor or the investment;

- By the State’s judicial system, as a whole, when it commits a denial of justice;
or

- By legislation or regulation of general application which modifies the applicable
legal framework to the detriment of the investor or the investment.

1310.The threshold of propriety required by FET must be determined by the tribunal in

1173

light of all the relevant circumstances of the case. To this end, the tribunal must
carefully analyse and take into consideration all the relevant facts, among them the
following factors:

- whether the host State has engaged in harassment, coercion, abuse of power, or
other bad-faith conduct against the investor;

- whether the State made specific representations to the investor before the
investment was made and then acted contrary to such representations;

- whether the State has respected the principles of due process, consistency, and
transparency when adopting the measures at issue;

- whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework, in
breach of the investor’s legitimate expectations.

270

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1311.In evaluating the State’s conduct, the Tribunal must balance the investor’s right to
be protected from improper state conduct against other legally relevant interests and
countervailing factors. First among these factors is the principle that legislation and
regulation are dynamic, and that (absent a treaty obligation to the contrary) States
enjoy a sovereign right to amend their laws and regulations and to adopt new ones
in furtherance of public interest, the conception of which can change over time.
Other countervailing factors affect the investor: it is the investor’s duty to perform
an appropriate pre-investment due diligence review and to observe a proper conduct
both before and during the investment.!!”4

1312.Claimants plead that Colombia, acting through the Contraloria, breached the FET
standard in three ways:

- by denying Prodeco due process in the course of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding
(A.)

- by acting with bias and bad faith (B.) and
- by breaching Claimants’ legitimate expectations (C.).
A, Due Process

1313.As a first line of argumentation, Claimants say that the Contraloria’s conduct of the
Fiscal Liability Proceeding denied Claimants’ due process:

- First, the Contraloria decided to join four junior civil servants to the
Proceedings, then attached their assets, and then agreed to release them once
those civil servants had changed their prior sworn witness statements and in their
new depositions incriminated Prodeco;

 

- Second, the Contraloria improperly denied Prodeco the opportunity to submit
certain additional evidence in its defence. !!7°

1314. Respondent disagrees.

1315.The Republic argues that the Contraloria did not flout procedural rules in order to
force Ingeominas’ officials to change their testimony against Prodeco:!!”° it
properly joined the officials to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and then reasonably
released them.'!”” Furthermore, to conclude the Prodeco had incurred fiscal liability
Dra. Vargas relied on extensive documentary evidence — not on the versions libres
y espontdneas of the civil servants.!

1316. As regards Claimants’ second argument, Respondent says that that the Contraloria
excluded some of Prodeco’s requests to adduce further evidence on a reasoned basis
and in accordance with applicable evidentiary rules and such exclusions did not
breach international law.!!””

1317.The Tribunal will first analyse whether breaches of due process amount to a
violation of the FET standard (a.), and then apply the principle to the present factual
situation (b. and ¢.).

a. Due Process as a Breach of FET

1318. The rule of law requires that in judicial proceedings (administered by a court of law
or a tribunal) and in administrative proceedings (administered by the public
administration) due process be respected: the adjudicator, be it a judge, tribunal
member, or administrative authority, must give each party a fair opportunity to
present its case and to marshal appropriate evidence, and then must assess the
submissions and the evidence in a reasoned, even-handed, and unbiased
decision. !!8°

1319. It is undisputed that a breach of due process, whether in judicial proceedings or in
administrative proceedings, may result in the violation of the FET standard.''*! But
the due process standard operates differently in different settings. In administrative
proceedings, like those before the Contraloria, the decision-maker is often the
investigator, the accuser, and the adjudicator, and a related officer (who may be the
senior officer of the decision-maker) is often the one who rules on appeal. Due
process does not require strict separation of these functions - provided that the final
administrative decision is subject to full judicial review. The private individual must
have an opportunity to have the case revisited, this time by an independent and
impartial judge, with the guarantee of a formal adversarial procedure.

1320.Other investment arbitration tribunals have reached similar conclusions. In
Thunderbird, the tribunal rejected the proposition that the due process standard
necessarily requires a formal adversarial procedure.''*? In AES, the tribunal
accepted that the due process standard “is not one of perfection” and stated that

“[I]t is only when a state’s acts or procedural omissions are [...] manifestly
unfair or unreasonable (such as would shock, or at least surprise a sense of

that the due process standard in an administrative process is lower than in a judicial process, an issue that
this Tribunal need not reach.

juridical propriety) [...] that the standard can be said to have been
infringed.”''8°

aK

1321.Claimants argue that two measures adopted by the Contraloria breached Prodeco’s
right to due process:

- The Contraloria’s decision to join four civil servants to the Proceedings and to
attach their assets, in order to force them to change their prior statements (b.);

- The Contraloria’s decision to deny Prodeco the right to submit additional
evidence after Prodeco’s formal indictment (c.).!!**

b. The Contraloria’s Behaviour vis-a-vis Four Civil Servants
(i) | Proven Facts
1322. The facts can be summarized as follows:

1323.On 11 July 2012, the Contraloria took the decision to extend the investigation not
only to the former Minister of Mines and to the former Director of Ingeominas, but
also to four junior civil servants of Ingeominas (Ms. Aristizabal, Ms. Cabezas, Mr.
Balcero, and Ms. Gomez). A few days thereafter, the Contraloria ordered the
attachment of the personal assets of each accused person, including the junior civil
servants, for the totality of the allegedly outstanding damage — USD 29 M.

1324. One year later, between April and May 2013, Dra Vargas, the Contralora Delegada
who was conducting the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, received the depositions of the
four civil servants. Because those individuals were no longer witnesses but
defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, under Colombian law they were not
required to swear to tell the truth, lest they be placed in a position where they might
incriminate themselves — they presented what in Colombian practice is known as a
“version libre y espontdnea”.

1325.Except in the case of Ms. Aristizabal, these versiones libres y espontdneas (which
have been summarized in section IIL(7).G supra) were different, in important
respects, from the officials’ prior sworn witness declarations, made in the initial
phase of the procedure. The versiones libres y espontdneas of Ms. Cabezas, Mr.
Balcero, and Ms. Gomez confirmed that the Viability Report had been prepared
after the signature of the Eighth Amendment and in general they incriminated
Director Ballesteros.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1326.In August 2013, Dra. Vargas issued the auto de imputacién. She dismissed the
accusation and closed the file with respect to Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero, and
Ms. Goémez, but not with regard to Ms. Aristizabal, who was now formally indicted.

1327.Nine months later, in April 2014, Ms. Aristizabal made a new deposition before
Dra. Vargas, this time also incriminating Director Ballesteros.

1328.The Contraloria’s Decision was issued in 2015. It convicted Director Ballesteros
and acquitted Ms. Aristizabal.

(ii) Discussion

1329. The proceso de responsabilidad fiscal is a purely inquisitorial procedure, in which
the Contraloria investigates the facts and then issues a decision. The inquisitorial
character is reinforced by the fact that the same officer — in the present case Dra.
Vargas — led the (major part of the) investigation, decided to indict or release
individuals, and ordered preliminary attachments of the assets. !!®°

1330.Dra. Vargas indeed made full use of the extensive powers which the law vested in
her. But Claimants have failed to prove that she used these powers in a manner to
cause a a breach of Prodeco’s right to due process.

1331. First, the persons affected by Dra. Vargas’ decisions were primarily the four junior
civil servants (who suffered the indictment and the attachment of their assets), and
Dr. Ballesteros (who was incriminated by the new depositions and eventually was
found guilty of fiscal liability) — but not Prodeco. The Contraloria did not support
its decision to hold Prodeco fiscally liable on the versiones libre y espontdneas of
the four junior civil servants. The fallo against Prodeco is based on documentary
evidence, not on depositions by witnesses.

1332.Second, this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, in the course of the Fiscal
Liability Proceeding, Prodeco never voiced concerns about the changes in the
successive depositions made by the civil servants.

 

1333.It follows that Prodeco’s due-process rights were not violated by Dra. Vargas’
decision to join the junior civil servants and attach their assets or by the particular
treatment given to Ms. Aristizabal. The right to be afforded due process, which is a
component of the right to be afforded FET under the Treaty, is a personal right of
Prodeco. Actions allegedly directed against and causing injury to third parties, even
if those parties were co-defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, could not
have breached Colombia’s obligations owed to Prodeco under the Treaty.

1334. Third, the Tribunal additionally considers, by a majority, that Claimants have failed
to prove that the Contraloria’s conduct regarding the four junior civil servants

485 See section IIL.(7).E supra; Doc. C-18; Doc. C-19; Doc. C-20.

274

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

breached due process.''$® Claimants imply that, after having joined the four junior
civil servants to the case, Dra. Vargas offered them a quid por quo: if you provide
incriminating depositions against Director Ballesteros, the Contraloria will release
you.

1335.There are only two indicia in the file which support this allegation:

- The case of Ms. Aristizabal: she initially failed to submit an incriminating
deposition, was not released with the other three junior civil servants, and was
eventually acquitted after having changed her deposition;

- The deposition of Minister Hernandez: he stated under oath that, towards the end
of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, he received a phone call from “Jeswaldo
Villeros”, who identified himself as a Director in the Contraloria and who
proposed to meet Mr. Hernandez outside of his office; Minister Hernandez
added: “I never wanted to agree to such a meeting, and a week later they found
me guilty”.!!87

1336. In the Tribunal’s opinion, by majority, the first indication is undermined by the fact
that Ms. Aristizabal indeed had a more senior role in the negotiation of the Eighth

Amendment than her colleagues: it was she who regularly briefed the Consejo

Directivo of the progress of the negotiations and of Ingeominas’ views.

1337. As regards the second indication, the Tribunal agrees that it was highly irregular for
a Director of the Contraloria to propose a secret meeting with a former Minister
who had been indicted. Testifying under oath, Dra. Vargas denied having any
involvement in or knowledge of Mr. Villeros’ telephone call.!'** The meeting in
any case never happened, according to the former Minister, and the mere telephone
call is insufficient to prove Claimants’ allegation.

c. Denial of Request to Marshal Evidence

1338.Claimants say that a second measure by the Contraloria infringed its due-process
rights: the denial of a request to marshal additional evidence.

(i) | Proven Facts

1339. The facts can be summarized as follows:

1186 Arbitrator Garibaldi disagrees with the majority’s conclusion on this point and the supporting analysis
in paragraphs 1334-1337. In Mr. Garibaldi’s view, once the Tribunal has established that the Contraloria’s
conduct regarding the four junior civil servants did not breach Prodeco’s due-process rights under the
Treaty (paragraph 1333), it is unnecessary and inappropriate for the Tribunal to consider whether such
conduct might have breached the applicable due-process standard in the abstract or Prodeco’s due-process
rights if the conduct had been directed against or caused harm to Prodeco. In addition, the Tribunal has no.
competence to determine whether such conduct might have breached the due-process rights of Prodeco’s
co-defendants.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

After being indicted, Prodeco requested that some additional evidence be
marshalled: a new expert report and the deposition of several witnesses. In a
reasoned decision, the Contraloria rejected most of the request, accepting only the
deposition of a single witness, with the argument that the new evidence was either
superfluous or useless.

Prodeco unsuccessfully challenged the Contraloria’s decision en via gubernativa
first before the Contralora Delegada, and then before the Contralora General.
Thereafter, Prodeco filed an accidn de tutela before the Colombian courts, which
proved unsuccesful in first instance. Prodeco eventually appealed to the Corte
Suprema, which reviewed the case and concluded:!!8?

“[...] dentro del proceso de responsabilidad fiscal no se ha yulnerado el

derecho al debido proceso y a la defensa de la accionante;” [Emphasis added]
(ii) Discussion
The Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants’ argument.

The Tribunal understands Prodeco’s dissatisfaction with the Contraloria’s stance.
The request for the opportunity to submit additional evidence was made at the
beginning of 2014, and the final Decision was not issued until April 2015. There
would thus have been ample time to depose the witnesses proposed by Prodeco and
to analyse the expert report which Prodeco proposed to incorporate. In hindsight,
the Contraloria’s decision unnecessarily limited Prodeco’s right to defend itself.

That said, the Tribunal does not see any wilful or otherwise egregious breach of the
foreign investor’s due-process rights for which Colombia should assume
international responsibility. The Contraloria duly reasoned its decision, the legal
system permitted Prodeco to challenge the decision before the courts, which
Prodeco did, and there is no allegation that, in finally dismissing Prodeco’s appeals,
the Colombian courts committed a denial of justice.

B. Bias and Bad Faith

Claimants further submit that the Contraloria and Dra. Vargas had made up their
minds to find Prodeco fiscally liable and were ready to bend applicable rules to
achieve that outcome. In August 2010, immediately after President Santos took
office, a new Contralora General, Ms. Morelli Rico, was appointed. The new
Contralora took it upon herself to clean up alleged irregularities in Ingeominas, and
reviewed contracts with Drummond, Cerro Matoso, and Prodeco. After excluding
the first two, Prodeco was the only mining company remaining within the purview
of Ms. Morelli’s initiative. Claimants contend that Ms. Morelli hand-picked Ms.
Vargas to run the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and to obtain a conviction of
Prodeco.!!%°

276

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1346. Claimants invoke a public interview in December 2013, in which Ms. Morelli Rico
indicated that she had already prejudged her decision in the Prodeco investigation.

1347.Respondent rejects Claimants’ accusations, labels them evidence-free character
assassination, and explains that in the public interview Ms. Morelli simply
explained that the Contraloria had already issued charges against Prodeco and that
there was at least some evidence of fiscal liability. !'9!

a. Bias as a Breach of FET

1348. Bias of a decision maker results in a breach of the FET standard.'!? A decision
based on prejudice for or against a person or a group cannot be said to be fair and
equitable. Case law confirms this conclusion, regardless of whether the biased
decision maker is a court or an administrative authority. In Deutsche Bank, the
Chief Justice acknowledged that the Supreme Court’s decision in question had been
issued for political motives — and the tribunal found that the FET standard had
indeed been breached.'!°3 In Metalclad''!™ the bias affected an administrative
authority, the Town Council, and was caused by popular opposition to the investor’s
hazardous-waste landfill project.

1349. While the principle that bias is inconsistent with the FET standard is clear, applying
that principle in a particular case is not always easy, because it must be established
that the offending decision was substantially based on spurious inclination and
prejudice, and not on other (valid) reasons. As in other cases of inherent difficulty
in proving facts, the existence and effects of bias can be proved by direct evidence
or by reasonable inferences drawn from proven indicia. Claimants base their
allegation of bias on the public interview given by the Contralora General while
the Fiscal Proceeding was underway.

b. Proven Facts

1350.On 12 December 2013, the Contralora General, Ms. Sandra Morelli, gave an
interview to the weekly Semana Sostenible, which published a report of her
activities and quoted several of her statements verbatim''. The timing of the
interview is relevant: the Contraloria had already issued the auto de imputacion
against Prodeco, and Prodeco had already filed its defence in October 2013. The
final decision of the Contralora Delegada was still pending; it would be issued in
2015.

1351. Another important consideration is that the decision to be made by the Contralora
Delegada might be subject to a recurso de apelacion, which would be decided by

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

the Contralora General herself. Hence it was for Ms. Morelli to have the final say
regarding Prodeco’s fiscal liability.

1352.The Semana Sostenible article refers to a variety of policies and measures adopted
by the Contraloria. It devotes a single paragraph to the Prodeco file:!!°

“Asi mismo, encontré que Prodeco, propiedad de Glencore Xstrata
International y cuya actividad esté basada en el carbén, no pagaba
efectivamente las regalias y la suma, de acuerdo con el proceso que estd en
curso, asciende a cerca de 50 mil millones de pesos. «El tema es sorprendente,
porque lo que hace la empresa es demandar al Estado por cobrar lo que
aparentemente debié habérsele pagado. Y digo aparentemente porque hay un
principio de prueba, pero esto se definird procesalmente», afirma Morelli”.

1353.There is no evidence in the file that Ms. Morelli ever publicly denied the
information provided by Semana Sostenible or the statements attributed to her.

1354. The paragraph quoted from the press article contains three statements attributed to
the Contralora General:

- A first statement, where the newspaper states Ms. Morelli’s opinion that Prodeco
was not properly paying the royalties due under the Mining Contract, in an
amount of almost COP 50 billion,

- Asecond statement, attributed verbatim to Ms. Morelli, expressing surprise that
Prodeco was suing the state (presumably by filing this investment arbitration),

- A third statement, again literally attributed to her, that there was “un principio
de prueba” against Prodeco, “pero esto se definird procesalmente”.

ce. Discussion

1355.It is unfortunate that Ms. Morelli, the highest authority within the Contraloria, saw
fit to make a public statement with regard to a file which was still being
investigated, and where she would be called upon to make the final decision. It is
even more unfortunate that she disclosed that Prodeco had failed to pay royalties
(in an amount that almost reached COP 50 billion), and that there was “un principio
de prueba” against Prodeco. Ms. Morelli did qualify her comments by saying “esto
se definird procesalmente”, that is, the matter will be definitively settled in the
administrative process.

1356.Respondent tries to justify Ms. Morelli’s public statement by arguing that the
Contraloria had already indicted Prodeco, that there was at least some evidence of

fiscal liability, and that Ms. Morelli was stating nothing more.!!°7

1357. The Tribunal agrees that an indictment can be issued only if the investigating officer
of the Contraloria finds “indicios” (i.e. a “principio de prueba” or preliminary

1196 Doc, C-266, p. 2.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

evidence) of malfeasance. But the existence of preliminary evidence in the file
supporting the indictment of Prodeco does not justify Ms. Morelli’s public
comments, which reveal not only her knowledge of the file but also her opinion that
Prodeco was not properly paying royalties and owed almost COP S50 billion. Since
that opinion dealt with the very issue that Ms. Morelli, as the highest authority
within the Contraloria, was called upon to adjudicate on appeal, it appears that Ms.
Morelli had already made up her mind, without having properly analysed Prodeco’s
defences and its arguments on appeal.

1358.Ms. Morelli’s public statements were reprehensible and ill-advised, and if she had

indeed ruled on appeal they might have breached the FET standard, but in the end
they were inconsequential. In August 2014, Ms. Morelli left office, and was
replaced by Mr. Maya as new Contralor General.'!°8 It was Mr. Maya who
reviewed and decided Prodeco’s recurso de apelacién.

1359.Claimants have not marshalled any evidence proving that either Ms. Vargas, the

Contralora Delegada who approved the Contraloria’s Decision, or her superior,
the Contralor General, Mr. Maya, who dismissed the recurso de apelacién, had
any bias against Prodeco or otherwise incurred in conduct which can be considered
as acting in bad faith.

1360. For these reasons, Claimants’ bias claim must be dismissed.

C. Legitimate Expectations

1361.Claimants argue that the Contraloria’s decision to initiate and conduct the Fiscal

Liability Proceeding, ultimately holding Prodeco fiscally liable, contravened
Claimants’ legitimate expectations:!!°°

- First, Colombia did not use its fiscal control powers in conformity with its usual
function of supervising fiscal management of state resources, but to nullify, in
effect, the commitments made in the Eighth Amendment for the first year; '200

- Second, the Contraloria adopted a decision that was radically incoherent and
inconsistent with the conduct of other Colombian authorities, for which there is
no precedent, and applied criteria to evaluate the Eighth Amendment different
from those considered by Ingeominas when negotiating and concluding the
Amendment;!°!

- Third, the Contraloria ignored the fact that the Eighth Amendment had enabled
the expansion of the Mine, that this expansion had been the basis of the
negotiation between the parties, and that in the Eighth Amendment Ingeominas

represented to Prodeco that the amendment “guarantees the interests of the
State”, 1202

1362.Respondent says in limine that legitimate expectations do not fall within the
ordinary meaning of FET.!?°

1363. Respondent then argues that Claimants’ legitimate expectations arise directly from
the Eighth Amendment and the contractual obligations it allegedly contained;
however, contractual expectations are not protected by the FET clause of the
Treaty. !?04

1364.Colombia adds that Claimants must be presumed to know the contents of the
Colombian legal and regulatory system and cannot plead that their legitimate
expectations did not take into account the ordinary functioning of that system. !2°5

1365. The Tribunal will first analyse the concept of legitimate expectations in general (a.);
then it will summarize the legal framework which Colombia applies to
administrative contracts in general and mining contracts in particular (b.); and
thereafter it will discuss in separate sub-sections the three breaches alleged by
Claimants: misuse of the Contraloria’s powers (c.), incoherence between different
Colombian authorities (d.), and incoherence in the criteria used by Ingeominas and
the Contraloria regarding the expansion of the Mine (e.).

a. Legitimate Expectations Within the FET Standard

1366.The Tribunal has already established that a State breaches the FET standard
guaranteed in Art. 4(2) of the Treaty if it adopts measures that violate certain
thresholds of propriety (including basic requirements of the rule of law), causing
harm to the investor’s investment. The appropriate threshold of propriety requires
a careful analysis of all the relevant circumstances, and the consideration of a
number of factors.

1367. Among these factors are the frustration of an investor’s legitimate expectations.!2°°

Such expectations arise when a State (or its agencies) makes representations or

1202 © IT, para. 259(c).

1203 R IL, para. 592.

1204 R TL, para. 594.

1205 R IL, para. 614.

1206 Arbitrator Garibaldi concurs in the use of the term “legitimate expectations” only in the understanding
that it means the same as “objectively reasonable expectations.” Mr. Garibaldi does not accept the
applicability of any unstated criterion of legitimacy other than objective reasonableness. In his view, the
term “legitimate expectations”, though commonly used, is singularly infelicitous, because “legitimate”
presupposes a criterion of legitimacy that is not always made explicit in the discussion of expectations
protected by the FET standard. In ordinary language, a reference to “legitimacy” presupposes, expressly or
tacitly, a legal, political, moral, religious, etc. criterion of legitimacy. Using the expression “legitimate
expectations” without anchoring it to a criterion of legitimacy based on objective reasonableness leaves the
term open to redefinition by changing the criterion of legitimacy to include or exclude expectations (on
moral, political, religious or other grounds) and so distort the original meaning of the term. Mr. Garibaldi
understands that when an investor’s expectations began to be considered as a factor in the FET analysis,

 

280

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

commitments or gives assurances, upon which the foreign investor (in the exercise
of an objectively reasonable business judgement) relies, and the frustration occurs
when the State thereafter changes its position as against those expectations in a way
that causes injury to the investor.!”°’ The protection of legitimate expectations is
closely connected with the principles of good faith, estoppel, and the prohibition of
venire contra factum proprium.'7°8

1368.A State can create legitimate expectations vis-d-vis a foreign investor in two
different contexts. In the first context, the State makes representations, assurances,
or commitments directly to the investor (or to a narrow class of investors or
potential investors). But legal expectations can also be created in some cases by the
State’s general legislative and regulatory framework: an investor may make an
investment in reasonable reliance upon the stability of that framework, so that in
certain circumstances a reform of the framework may breach the investor’s
legitimate expectations.

1369.In the present case, this second type of legitimate expectations is not at issue, as
Claimants do not allege that the general Colombian legal framework gave rise to
legitimate expectations. Claimants’ case is much more specific: when Colombia
agreed to sign the Mining Contract, it is said to have created the legitimate
expectation that the Republic would not repudiate the obligations assumed therein.
These legitimate expectations were violated by an administrative act, the
Contraloria’s Decision, for which Colombia should assume international
responsibility.

Respondent’s first counter-argument

1370.Respondent says that the ordinary meaning of FET excludes any protection for
legitimate expectations and invokes, as support, the separate opinion of Judge
Nikken in Suez. !?°

1371. The Tribunal does not agree with Colombia’s position.

1372. Virtually unanimous case law identifies legitimate expectations of the investor as
an important element of the FET standard.'?!° So does scholarly opinion.!?!! The

the original idea was to refer to an investor’s reasonable expectations, that is, expectations that an
(objective) investor of ordinary prudence would have, as distinguished from the actual expectations of a
particular investor. He believes that this is still the right concept, and this is the sense in which he
understands the term “legitimate expectations”.

only dissenting opinion seems to be that of Judge Nikken, who acknowledges that
his position is contrary to the finding in “recent awards”. '?!?

Respondent’s second counter-argument

1373.Respondent submits a second counter-argument: Colombia contends that contracts

between the investor and the State are incapable of creating legitimate expectations,
and that consequently no treaty breach can result from an investor’s mere
contractual expectations. !?!3

1374. Legitimate expectations arise out of representations, assurances, or commitments

made by the State, on which the investor reasonably relies. The Tribunal has already
concluded that, depending on the circumstances, such representations, assurances,
or commitments can be generated by acts specifically addressed to the investor or
by the general legislative framework. The Tribunal sees no difficulty in including
State-investor contracts among the instruments which can generate such
representations, assurances, and commitments: !214 the essence of any contract is a
reciprocal undertaking that each party will comply with the obligations stated
therein.

1375.The question is not so much whether representations and assurances formalized in

contracts generate legitimate expectations (they do), but rather whether the
subsequent breach by the State of obligations undertaken by contract results in a
violation of the FET standard.

1376. The status quaestionis has been summarized by Schreuer:'?!>

“Tt is unlikely that a view will prevail that sees each and every violation of a
contract as a breach of the FET standard. Where the outer limits of FET with
regard to contracts will be drawn is another matter. A formal repudiation of
the contract by way of a sovereign act may not be the best criterion. In fact,
an action that abrogates a contract through an act of puissance publique would
probably more accurately be described as an expropriation. A more relevant
test for the violation of the FET standard with respect to contracts would be
whether the investor’s legitimate expectations regarding a secure and stable
legal framework are affected. Not every violation of a contract would trigger

a finding to this effect. [...] .” [Emphasis added]

 

1377.The tribunal in SAUR'?!° reached a similar conclusion:

“El estandar de TJE [...] es diferente del deber de los Estados de atenerse a
su propia legislacién y de cumplir los compromisos contractualmente
asumidos frente a terceros. [...]. El Derecho internacional no cubre todo
incumplimiento normativo o contractual de un Estado en todas las

1378.Summing up, different kinds of acts and measures, including contracts between the
investor and the State, can give rise to an investor’s legitimate expectations. But a
mere contractual breach by the State will not per se result in a violation of the
international law FET standard.'?'7 An additional element (be it the special
significance of the breach, an act of puissance publique, loss of a secure and stable
legal framework, and so on) is required to trigger international responsibility.

b. Colombian Legal Regime Applicable to State Contracts

1379. To analyse Claimants’ argument that Colombia’s actions breached their legitimate
expectations, it is necessary, as a preliminary step, to summarize the legal
framework applicable to Colombian administrative contracts in general, and mining
contracts in particular.

1380.The Colombian legal framework for mining contracts is idiosyncratic. The
contractual relationship between a private party and the Republic (or any of its
agencies) is simultaneously subject to two starkly different systems, ruled by
different laws, administered by separate agencies, which wield different levels of
power and pursue different (and sometimes conflicting) objectives:

- the first system is the law of contracts, administered by the Mining Agency, and
subject to the competence of the tribunales contencioso-administrativos (i), and

- the second system is the fiscal liability regime, under the aegis of the Contraloria

(ii).
(i) Law of Contracts

1381.Under the law of (administrative) contracts, the Mining Contract is considered as a
“contrato de aporte”, governed primarily by the 1988 Mining Code!?!® and
subsidiarily by the general rules on civil and commercial contracts, !7!° which cover
(inter alia) the parties’ obligations, the consequences of a breach of such
obligations, and the causes and effects of annulment.

1382. Contratos de aporte may include dispute resolution clauses. In the Mining Contract,
the parties agreed that all disputes deriving from the Contract would be settled by

the Colombian courts (“rama jurisdiccional del poder ptiblico colombiano”), unless
the parties agreed ex post to submit a dispute to domestic arbitration. '??°

(ii) Fiscal Liability Regime

1383. One of the unusual characteristics of Colombian law is that administrative contracts,
including contratos de aporte, are also subject to the so-called “control fiscal” (best
translated into English as “treasury control”) by a specialized agency, the
Contraloria.

1384. The requirement that the Republic’s use of public funds be subject to special control
derives from the Constitution: pursuant to Art. 267 of the Constitucién Politica,
fiscal control is a public function exercised by the Contraloria,'*! an autonomous
organ of the Colombian State, in charge of supervising the use of funds by the state
treasury. !??

1385.The Contraloria, which is governed by Law 610 of 2000, has sweeping powers to
initiate and conduct a so-called “Fiscal Liability Proceeding”, not only against civil
servants, but also against private individuals, provided that these individuals
exercise public functions or use assets of the Nation: !”

“[...] determinar y establecer la responsabilidad de los servidores piblicos y
de los particulares, cuando en el ejercicio de la gestion fiscal 0 con ocasién
de ésta, causen por accion u omisién y en forma dolosa o culposa un daiio al
patrimonio del Estado”. [Emphasis added]

1386.The extension of fiscal liability to private individuals has been upheld by the
Colombian Constitutional Court.!?”4

1220 Doc, C-2, Clause 32.1.

221 Doc, C-68, Art. 267: “El control fiscal es una funcin piblica que ejercerd la Contraloria General de
la Repiiblica, la cual vigila la gestion fiscal de la administracién y de los particulares o entidades que
manejen fondos o bienes de la Nacién”.

1222 Doc, C-68, Art. 267; Doc. C-72, Arts. 1 and 3.

1223 Doc, C-71, Art. 1; Doc. C-72, Art. 4.12.

1224 The Colombian Constitutional Court explained in Judgment T-1012/08 (Doc. R-192, p. 2), “En relacion
con la interpretacion de las normas constitucionales y legales y, en especial, respecto de la calidad de
destinatario del proceso fiscal del particular contratista con el Estado, tanto la jurisprudencia de la Corte
Constitucional como la del Consejo de Estado, ha sido enfatica en sostener no sélo que los contratistas
con el Estado son sujetos de vigilancia fiscal, sino también que el control sobre la gestion adelantada por
las autoridades piiblicas y los particulares en la contrataci6n publica se justifica por la naturaleza misma
del control fiscal que fue disenado para defender el erario piblico y garantizar la eficiencia y eficacia los
recursos publicos”. Similarly, the Constitutional Court in Judgment C-840/01 (Doc. R-37, p. 18) held that
“la esfera de la gestion fiscal ituye el elemento lante y i de las ili
inherentes al manejo de fondos y bienes del Estado por parte de los servidores piblicos y de los
particulares. Siendo por tanto indiferente la condicién piiblica o privada del respectivo responsable,
cuando de establecer responsabilidades fiscales se trata”.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Requirements

1387.The requirements for the establishment of fiscal liability mirror those for extra-
contractual responsibility:

- (i) a “conducta dolosa o culposa’” by the civil servant or the private individual
engaged in “gestidn fiscal”,

- (ii) which causes patrimonial damage to the Republic, and

- (iii) a causal link between the conduct and the damage. !?*°

1388. This derives from Art. 5 of Law 610 of 2000, which provides that:!?7°

“Lar bilidad fiscal estara i la por los l
- Una conducta dolosa o culposa atribuible a una persona que realiza gestién
fiscal.

- Un dafio patrimonial al Estado.
- Un nexo causal entre los dos elementos anteriores”.

1389. The fiscal liability procedure is a purely administrative and inquisitorial procedure,
in which the Contraloria investigates the facts and then issues a decision (fallo),
which can be appealed first “en via gubernativa” (before the administration) and
thereafter to the tribunales contencioso-administrativos (specialized courts having
competence on administrative matters).

1390. If the investigation by the Contraloria concludes that fiscal liability has indeed been
engaged, the consequence is that the civil servant or private individual must pay
compensation equal to the damage suffered by the State. !??”

(iii) Fiscal Liability in Administrative Contracts

1391.Fiscal liability can also arise when a private individual enters into a contract with
the Colombian State or with any of its agencies. Liability will extend not only to
the civil servants and other officers who authorized the contract, but potentially also
to the private counterparty — even if the counterparty has duly performed its side of
the bargain.

1392.Fiscal liability does not require the violation of any norm, the breach of any
contractual commitment, or any illegality affecting the contract. Its requirements
are the same as those of a generic tort (damnum injuria datum): liability is engaged
whenever a private individual incurs in conducta dolosa o culposa when

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

negotiating, executing, or performing a contract, and such behaviour causes damage
to the State.

1393.Conversely, the Contraloria’s decision has no impact on the contract, which
continues in full force and effect, and has to be complied with by the private party
and by the public party. !278

(iv) Precedents

1394.The Tribunal asked the parties to identify published precedents where the
Contraloria declared the fiscal liability of a private counter-party which had entered
into a contract with the Colombian State and had ordered such counter-party to
restitute to the State amounts accrued and paid under the contract.

1395.Respondent has drawn the attention of the Tribunal to the following precedents:
Decision 015

1396.The leading case in this matter seems to be Decision 015 of 15 April 2002,
[“Decision 015”, issued two years after the enactment of Law 610 of 2000.!??? In
that case the Contraloria analysed two separate contracts:

1397.First: the company Aurea Ltda. had signed a contract with the Camara de los
Representantes for the creation of an inventory of assets. The Contraloria initiated
a fiscal liability procedure against Aurea Ltda., the President of the Camara de
Representantes, and certain civil servants. The Contraloria concluded that Aurea
Ltda. had breached its contractual obligations, and that such breach implied
“conducta culposa”, causing the Cdmara de Representantes to forfeit the advance
payment. '?*? Aurea Ltda. (together with the President and certain civil servants of
the Camara) was ordered to pay the damage caused to the Republic.

1398.Second: Implegraficas Cabrini, a firm owned by a certain Mr. Cabrera, had sold
paper to the Camara de Representantes and, taking advantage of the lack of
knowledge and diligence of the civil servants, had applied a price which exceeded
market prices by 100%.!73! The Contraloria found that the firm had incurred in
mala fe and dolo, by quoting prices which were exaggerated. The Contraloria made
the following statements:

“El sefior CABRERA VEGA no estaba en ejercicio de su actividad privada o
particular, estaba contratando con el Estado y esto le generaba obli,

las que istian en coadyuvar a cumplir los fines ciales del Estado,
tenia esa im isima funcion social y por ende era su obli; én_actuar
con lealtad; lealtad hacia el Estado en el que él mismo se desenvuelve y
respecto del cual él mismo se sirve.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Colombia es un Estado Social de Derecho y como tal impone obligaciones y
deberes no solo a sus servidores sino también a los particulares que se
desenvuelven dentro del territorio nacional. Por eso, el articulo 3 de la ley 80
de 1.993, preceptua como obligacion para los particulares cuando contratan
con el Estado, ademds de su derecho a obtener utilidades, las que estan
protegidas por el mismo Estado, colaborar en el logro de sus fines sociales,
cumpliendo una funcién social que como tal, implica obligaciones”.
[Emphasis added, bold in the original]

1399. The Contraloria used the following definition of dolo:!?**

“Pregunta [el Sr. Cabrera] donde esta la mala fe, se le responde que es
pi en esa actitud ina y de de en donde estd la mala
fe, en donde estd el dolo, su_mala_intencién_de_aprovecharse de unas

circunstancias erradas para sacar mayor provecho y mayor lucro del que las
reglas del mercado en ese momento le estaban ofreciendo”. [Emphasis added]

1400. The consequence of the Contraloria’s finding was that the President of the Camara,
certain civil servants, Implegraficas Cabrini, and Mr. Cabrera himself were jointly
ordered to compensate the damage caused to the State.

Other Decisions

1401.Decision 015 became a leading case and led to numerous decisions in which the
Contraloria held private parties fiscally liable for failing to provide the services for
which they had been retained by public entities or for embezzling funds advanced
by public entities. '7**

1402.One of the cases is Decision 013 of 2011, in which the Contraloria held a bank
fiscally liable for breach of a checking account contract. The Consejo Superior de
la Judicatura — the owner of the checking account — had expressly requested that
significant checks be confirmed before payment. Banco Popular failed to do so, and
was made responsible of the damage caused: !7*4

“[...] el actuar negligente del Banco al incumplir con los deberes
contractuales establecidos para la operacién cambiaria, como lo era la
confirmacion de los cheques previa a su monetizacion”.

1403. Another group of cases refers to construction contracts. The Contraloria repeatedly
held private contractors responsible for the damage to the State, caused by breach
of contractual obligations. '*

 

1232 Doc, RL-208, p. 50.

1233 Cases are summarized in RPHB, para. 86 (Doc. RL-211; Doc. RL-204; Doc. RL-219; Doc. RL-220).
24 Doc, RL-207, p. 27.

1235 Cases are summarized in RPHB, paras. 99-101. In CPHB, para. 50 Claimants submit that, further to
Decision 015 there is only one further precedent, namely Decision 130 of 2012 (Doc. RL-200), in which
the Contraloria criticized the price set out in a State contract, adding that “importantly in that decision the
Contraloria only held the agent of the State party liable”. This conclusion is contradicted by Decision 130,

287

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1404. Summing up, at least since Decision 015, adopted in 2002, the Contraloria has been
regularly using its fiscal powers to review administrative contracts entered into
between the State, including its agencies, and private individuals.

1405.In this process of review, the Contraloria has frequently focused not only on the
officials who negotiated or authorized the transaction, but also against the private
party that contracted with the State. The Contraloria has concluded that the private
counterparty had indeed incurred fiscal liability (jointly with the officials) when
obligations were breached, excessive prices were applied, or public funds were
embezzled.

1406. In reaching these conclusions, the Contraloria adopted an expansive interpretation
of the concepts of culpa and dolo, and of the good faith obligation owed by private
contractors vis-d-vis the State.

1407. The Tribunal will now analyse Claimants’ claim that the Contraloria violated their
legitimate expectations in three ways: misuse of fiscal powers (c.), inconsistent
conduct (d.), and expansion of the Mine (e.).

c. First Alleged Violation: Misuse of Fiscal Control Powers

1408.Claimants argue that Colombia violated their legitimate expectations because the
Republic did not use its fiscal control powers in conformity with their usual function
of supervising fiscal management of state resources, but rather effectively to nullify
the commitments in the Eighth Amendment for the year 2010. '?*°

Discussion

1409. Claimants’ contention has two aspects: (i) that they had legitimate expectations that
the fiscal control regime would not be applied to Prodeco or the Eighth Amendment,
and (ii) that they had legitimate expectations that the fiscal control regime would
not be applied to Prodeco in an abusive, improper, or unreasonable manner.

1410. With regard to the first aspect of Claimants’ contention, the Tribunal considers that
Claimants have failed to prove that their legitimate expectations were frustrated by
the mere fact that the fiscal control regime was applied to Prodeco and the Eighth
Amendment.

1411.Prodeco and Ingeominas discussed the content of the Eighth Amendment between
2008 and January 2010. During those negotiations, Prodeco, a sophisticated
company using in-house and outside counsel, was aware (or must be deemed to
have been aware) of the idiosyncratic nature of the Colombian legal regime
applicable to administrative contracts in general and to contratos de aporte and their
amendments in particular:

which on p. 55 and on p. 103 (the very pages quoted by Claimants) comes to the opposite conclusion and
declares the fiscal responsibility of the private party. Given the clear wording of the Decision, the Tribunal
wonders how this apparent mistake could creep into Claimants’ submission.

1236 © IT, para. 259(a).

 

288

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

- On one side, Prodeco must be taken to have assumed that in due course
Ingeominas (or its successor) could raise disputes against Prodeco, including
claims regarding the validity of the contract, before the domestic administrative
courts, as agreed upon in the dispute-resolution clause of the Mining Contract;

- On the other side, Prodeco (after enactment of Law 610 of 2000 and adoption
by the Contraloria of Decision 015 in 2002 and the line of decisions which
follow this precedent) must be taken to have envisaged the possibility that the
supervisory agency might review the Eighth Amendment, find that Prodeco
acted with dolo or culpa in the negotiation or execution of the Amendment, and
order Prodeco to compensate the damage caused to the State.

1412.Claimants’ allegation that they had a legitimate expectation that the Contraloria
would abstain from using its fiscal powers and filing a Fiscal Liability Proceeding
is baseless. Colombia never made a representation to that effect. To the contrary:
Claimants were aware that Ingeominas denied registration of the Initial Version of
the Eighth Amendment, precisely because it considered the terms of such agreement
“lesivo[s] para el Estado”. The requirement that the Eighth Amendment be
favourable to the interests of Ingeominas, and hence the State, had been a constant
contention during the negotiation. !7*7

1413.The same conclusion applies to the Contraloria’s Decision as applied to Prodeco.
By subjecting Prodeco to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding Colombia used its fiscal
control powers in a way which was not materially different from that applied in
previous cases. In this respect, the Decision was not an unexpected outlier: it
follows interpretations of the law and uses arguments which the Contraloria had
already applied in numerous precedents. That the Prodeco Decision was not
unexpected, and follows a long line of similar resolutions, is confirmed by the Cerro
Matoso decision, a case involving another mining company. This decision was
adopted in 2018, and the criteria applied by the Contraloria are similar to those in
the present case. !258

1414. Summing up, Colombia’s dual legal framework for administrative contracts permits
that disputes be adjudicated either

- by acourt, applying the law of contract,
- and/or by the Contraloria, applying its idiosyncratic law, akin to the law of tort.
1415.When Prodeco and Ingeominas negotiated and executed the Eighth Amendment,

Colombia’s dual legal framework for administrative contracts had been in existence
for more than a decade. Prodeco was aware (or with minimal due diligence could

237 See section IL(4) supra.
238 RPHB, paras. 102-108, referring to Doc. RL-235.

289

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

have been aware) of its existence and implications.'? As the Republic rightly
1240

says:
“Claimants must accept that they are presumed to know the contents of the
Colombian legal and regulatory system. They cannot be heard to plead that
their legitimate expectations did not take into account the ordinary functioning
of the system”.

1416. Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants’ argument that the mere fact that
such legal framework was applied to the Eighth Amendment violated their
legitimate expectations.

1417. The second aspect to Claimants’ argument is that the Contraloria frustrated their
legitimate expectations that the fiscal control regime would not be applied to
Prodeco in an abusive, improper, or unreasonable manner. This second aspect of
Claimants’ FET claim coincides with Claimants’ separate claim that their
investment in Colombia was impaired by Colombia adopting “unreasonable
measures” in breach of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty. Section VI.3.(2.2). infra will analyse
these arguments in depth.

d. Second Alleged Violation: Inconsistent Conduct of Colombia

1418. Claimants also argue that Colombia breached their legitimate expectations because
various Colombian authorities, and specifically Ingeominas and the Contraloria,
adopted decisions that were radically incoherent and inconsistent with each
other. !24!

Discussion

1419.The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that an investor may legitimately hold the
expectation that different branches of government will not take inconsistent actions
affecting the investment: a government agency should not make a decision that
contradicts a prior decision made by the same or another agency, acting within the
same sphere of powers, on which the investor has relied, causing harm to the
investor.'? This is part of the core meaning of the FET standard.

1420. There is no insconsistency and no breach of legitimate expectations, however, when
the second agency, applying substantive legal criteria established in a pre-existing
legal framework, takes a decision which diverges from that previously adopted by
another agency. The reason is simple: The modern nation-state typically endows
different agencies with different legal and policy responsibilities and objectives.

290

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1421.Claimants say that, to evaluate the Eighth Amendment, the Contraloria applied
criteria different from those considered by Ingeominas when negotiating and
agreeing to such amendment, resulting in a breach of their legitimate expectations.

1422. That is not the proper test.

1423.Claimants’ legitimate expectations to consistent conduct on the part of Colombia
could have been violated if the Contraloria had made its decision on the basis of
criteria different from those set forth in the pre-existing legal framework. In fact,
the Contraloria did base its decision on the pre-existing fiscal-liability regime.
Whether the Contraloria applied those pre-existing criteria in an abusive,
unreasonable, or improper manner is a separate question, to be analysed in Section
VI.3.(2.2). infra.

1424. Ingeominas approved and executed the Mining Contract, and then the Contraloria
reviewed Ingeominas’ decision, applying its powers under the Colombian fiscal
liability regime, as it had stood at least since 2002 (and which has been described
in detail in Section VI.3.(2.1).C.b. supra).

1425.Claimants’ legitimate expectations of consistency were not breached by the
application of the fiscal liability regime: every diligent investor must be assumed to
know and to accept that Colombia has implemented a dual framework for
administrative contracts, submitting such contracts (and their amendments) not only
to the law of contract, but also to the fiscal liability regime entrusted to the
Contraloria.

e. Third Alleged Violation: Expansion of the Mine

1426. Finally, Claimants say that their legitimate expectations were breached, because
Ingeominas expressly acknowledged that the expansion of the Mine was “the basis
of the negotiations among the parties”, and the Contraloria ignored this
acknowledgement. !743

1427. The Tribunal again disagrees. Claimants’ argument in this respect is a variant of its
consistency argument, already addressed, and must be dismissed for the same
reason.

1428. There is abundant evidence that the expansion of the Mine was indeed the principal
basis for the negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas and the execution of the
Eighth Amendment. This is also reflected in Considerando 6 of the Eighth
Amendment, which reads as follows:

“6. Que con el presente acuerdo se garantizan los intereses del Estado y la
viabilidad de la expansion del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el fundamento
de la negociaci6n entre las partes”.

243 C J, paras. 196-198; C II, para. 270(b).

291

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1429. But this established fact did not create a legitimate expectation that, in applying pre-
existing substantive legal criteria, the Contraloria would not review the Eighth
Amendment, applying the fiscal liability regime.

1430. A separate question is whether, in calculating damages, the Contraloria should have
taken into consideration the agreed expansion of the Mine capacity. This issue is
addressed in section VI.3.(2.2).B.c.(iv) infra.

(2.2) UNREASONABLE MEASURES

1431.In accordance with the Treaty, Colombia has assumed not only a positive obligation
— to provide FET — but also a negative one: to abstain from unreasonable or
discriminatory measures affecting protected investments.

1432. Claimants are not pleading discrimination, and consequently it is not necessary that
the Tribunal delve into its meaning.

1433.Claimants however plead that the measures adopted by Colombia were not only
unreasonable but also “arbitrary” — a concept not mentioned in the Treaty. !?44 In
essence, Claimants say that the Contraloria’s findings

- that Prodeco acted with dolo with the intention of causing damage to the
State,!?> and

- that the damage caused to the State should be calculated based on the Transition
Period, the first year of the long-term Mining Contract'**°

constitute an “arbitrary and unreasonable” measure, !747

Treaty.

contrary to Art. 4(1) of the

1434. Respondent disagrees on the following grounds:

- The Contraloria properly decided that Prodeco satisfied the elements for fiscal
liability in a 234-page reasoned opinion after four years of proceedings, and
found that Prodeco had acted with dolo; after extensive analysis of Prodeco’s
bad-faith negotiations of the Eighth Amendment, the Contraloria concluded that
Prodeco had performed a number of manoeuvers to reduce the compensation
and thus failed to comply with its duties as a collaborator of the State;'?*

- Claimants’ disagreement with the calculation of damage in the Contraloria’s
Decision must be rejected because it interferes with the right of domestic
authorities to regulate within the State’s territory;'? additionally, the

calculation is based on the Transition Period of the Mining Contract because it
constituted a distinct contractual period with its own economic formula. !?°°

1435. The Tribunal will first establish the meaning of “unreasonable measure” as used in
Art. 4(1) of the Treaty (A.), then it will discuss whether two specific findings of the
Contraloria meet the test of reasonability: the calculation of damages (B.) and the
finding that Prodeco acted with dolo (C.). Finally, the Tribunal will address the
postponed question whether the way in which the Contraloria applied the Fiscal
Control Regime to Prodeco frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations in
violation of the FET standard of the Treaty (D.)

A. Impairment of an Investment by Unreasonable Measures

1436.The Parties have discussed the precise meaning of the term “unreasonable
measures” as used in Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.

1437.Claimants accepts Respondent’s proposition that unreasonable conduct includes
actions involving prejudice, preference, or bias that shocks a sense of judicial
propriety. !?>!

1438. But Claimants add that measures are also arbitrary when they inflict damage on the
investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose, are not based on legal
standards but rather on discretion, are taken for reasons that are different from those
put forward by the decision-maker, or are in wilful disregard of due process and
proper procedure. !75?

1439. Claimants finally submit that confusion and lack of clarity, even if unintended, may
result in arbitrariness. It follows that measures may be arbitrary even if not adopted
in bad faith. Measures may also be arbitrary when they are adopted without
engaging in a rational decision-making process or when the State fails to base its
actions on reasoned judgement. !?°

1440. Claimants finally say that that the actions of the Contraloria are not entitled to
automatic and unlimited deference as to their conformity with the Treaty.'?*

Respondent

1441. Respondent argues that the standard for arbitrary conduct is a high one, requiring a
showing of conduct tainted by prejudice, preference or bias that shocks or surprises
a sense of judicial propriety.'? Satisfying that standard is still more difficult when
it comes to second-guessing legitimate regulatory or control measures, because

framework is arbitrary only if it constitutes a deliberate repudiation of that
framework, and even then, only if there are no domestic resources available to
correct the application. '?°7

1442.In summary, Respondent submits that the Contraloria’s Decision does not come
close to being arbitrary according to the international standard. Claimants have not
alleged any improper motive behind the actions of the Contraloria. To the contrary,
the Contraloria’s Decision complied with the agency’s mandate. !7°°

Art. 4(1) of the Treaty
1443. Art. 4(1) of the Treaty obliges the contracting State not to:

“[...] impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, should it so happen,
liquidation of such [protected] investments.”

1444.An interesting feature of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty is its drafters’ choice of
terminology. Other BITs — including certain treaties signed by Colombia-!?°
include a prohibition against “arbitrary or discriminatory” measures. The Swiss-
Colombian BIT however uses the expression “unreasonable or discriminatory”
measures (in Spanish, “medidas no razonables o discriminatorias”). Are
“unreasonable measures” and “arbitrary measures” synonyms?

1445. As a matter of ordinary meaning, the term “unreasonable measures” seems to define
a set of actions which is wider than “arbitrary measures”.

1446. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, arbitrary decisions are based on
random choice or personal whim, rather than reason. 1260 Tf a measure is arbitrary, it
cannot simultaneously conform to reason. It follows that all measures which are
arbitrary are also unreasonable — but not vice-versa. The set of unreasonable
measures is wider than that of arbitrary measures.

a, Arbitrary Measures
1447. What does “arbitrary” mean?

1448. Arbitrariness has been described as “founded on prejudice or preference rather than
on reason or fact”;!?°! “[...] contrary to the law because...[it] shocks, or at least
surprises, a sense of juridical propriety;'” or “wilful disregard of due process of
law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of judicial propriety”; !?° or
conduct which “manifestly violate[s] the requirements of consistency,

transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination”.!?5+

1449. In EDF, Professor Schreuer, appearing as an expert, defined as “arbitrary”,

“a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent
legitimate purpose;

b. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice
or personal preference;

c. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the
decision maker;

d. a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.”

And the Tribunal seemed to accept such definition when it analysed and ultimately
rejected the claimant’s claim that Romania had taken unreasonable or
discriminatory measures. !76°

1450. Summing up, the underlying notion of arbitrariness is that prejudice, preference, or
bias is substituted for the rule of law. '26°

b. Unreasonable Measures

1451.The Parties have discussed whether the prohibition of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty
extends not only to arbitrary measures, but also to those adopted without reasoned
judgement or without a rational decision-making process.

1452. The very wording of the Treaty provides the answer to this question. The Treaty
does not refer to “arbitrary measures”. It prohibits the wider set of “unreasonable
measures”. As already found, “unreasonable measures” include not only “arbitrary
measures” but also measures that are irrational in themselves or result from an
irrational decision-making process.

1453.In this question, the Tribunal subscribes to the finding of the tribunal in LG&E,
when it said that the contracting states (in that case Argentina and the United
States)!?67

“wanted to prohibit themselves from implementing measures that affect the
investments of nationals of the other Party without engaging in a rational

decision-making process”. [Emphasis added]
1454. The LG&E tribunal added:

“Certainly a State that fails to base its actions on reasoned judgement, and uses
abusive arguments instead, would not ‘stimulate the flow of private
capital’ "1258

High Threshold

1455.Respondent insists that the threshold for proving that conduct is unreasonable
should be a high one.

1456. The Tribunal, by majority, tends to agree.

1457. Investment arbitration tribunals are not called to adjudicate appeals against
measures adopted by States or their agencies. Their task is to establish whether the
state’s conduct vis-d-vis protected foreign investors is tainted by prejudice,
preference or bias or is so totally incompatible with reason that it constitutes an
international wrong.

1458. The Tribunal, by majority, also agrees with the Republic that satisfying the standard
is more difficult when it comes to reviewing regulatory or control measures,
because States, and especially supervisory agencies, should enjoy deference.
Supervisors are frequently required to take decision in short timeframes, making
complex assessments of countervailing interests. Arbitral tribunals, sitting
comfortably in the future, with full knowledge of the supervening events, must take
the individual circumstances of each decision into consideration and avoid the
temptation of using hindsight as the basis for assessing reasonableness. !?

1267 Doc. CL-46, para. 158; LG&E applies a treaty where the words used were “arbitrary or discriminatory
measures”; the reasoning of LG&E is even more appropriate in a Treaty like the Swiss-Colombian BIT
which refers to “unreasonable or arbitrary measures”.

1268 TG&E, para. 158. Contrary to Respondent’s submission, the LG&E award does not state that a finding
of unreasonable measures requires a showing of conduct that shocks or surprises a sense of judicial
propriety. LG&E mentions this requirement when analyzing discrimination — not when referring to
measures not based on reasoned judgement.

1269 Arbitrator Garibaldi disagrees with the majority’s position stated in paragraphs 1456 and 1458. First,
he does not agree with the characterization of the standard of unreasonableness as a high one (or low or
medium one, for that matter). He considers that such characterizations are useless in the absence of
comparators or an agreed yardstick; they are rhetorical devices that have their proper place in counsel’s
arguments, not in a tribunal’s decision. A tribunal’s duty is to apply the standard laid down in the applicable
treaty, whatever that standard is and however it might be characterized. Second, Mr. Garibaldi does not
agree that “satisfying the standard is more difficult when it comes to reviewing regulatory or control

B. Damages

1459. Claimants finally say that the Contraloria’s Decision constitutes an unreasonable
measure because the determination of the existence of damage to the State is based
on a narrow analysis of the first year of the long-term Mining Contract, illogically
relying on the Transition Period.!?”°

1460. Respondent disagrees: the Transition Period constitutes a distinct contractual period
with its own economic formula, and this justifies the use of such period for the
calculation of damages. !27!

1461.The Tribunal will summarize the Contraloria’s calculation of damages (a.),
including the Tovar-Silva Report (b.), will then analyse the meaning of the
Transition Period within the Mining Contract (c.), and finally it will reach its
conclusions applying the standards of the Treaty (d.)

a. The Methodology of the Tovar-Silva Report

1462.The methodology for the calculation of damages in the Contraloria’s Decision is
based on the Tovar-Silva Report. This report was prepared in March 2011, i.e. four
years before the Contraloria’s Decision was issued, by a junior officer of the
Contraloria, Ms. Johanna Tovar Silva.

1463.The Tovar-Silva Report based its finding on the Eighth Amendment’s so-called
Transition Period, which was the period between 1 January and 31 December
2010.!2”? Ms. Tovar Silva explained that:!27*

“Los presentes cdlculos fueron efectuados sobre los embarques realizados
durante el periodo de transicién pactado por las partes [...] sin perjuicio del
cdlculo que pueda presentarse con posterioridad al embarque 555-2010 de
03 de noviembre de 2010, toda vez que de acuerdo con las directrices
institucionales el daiio causado habra de ser determinable y por extensién
cuantificable, situacién que en los contratos de tracto sucesivo se diluye ante
la posibilidad de compensacién de cargas contractuales, pero que en el caso
objeto _de estudio se ha lidado_pl. como _daios por haber
vencido el término definido por las partes como ‘periodo de transicién”.
[Emphasis added]

 

measures, because states, and especially supervisory agencies, should enjoy deference” (paragraph 1458).
He is unable to find anything in the Treaty or in general international law requiring this Tribunal to defer
in any way to state agencies in matters concerning the application of the Treaty standards. This is not to say
that the Tribunal is free to impose its own conception of reasonableness or to ignore the circumstances
referred to in paragraph 1458. This and any other treaty standard must be interpreted and applied in good
faith under the rules of the VCLT. But the interpretation and application process must be impartial, not
influenced by any sense of deference to one party to the dispute or solicitude to the other.

271 R T, para. 463.

1272 Tp the additional report to the Tovar-Silva Report, Ms. Tovar Silva explains that she calculated the
Royalties for the period 1 January through 31 December 2010, and the Additional Royalty from 7
November 2009 through 6 November 2010; Doc. C-147, p. 4.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1464.Ms. Tovar Silva’s analysis draws attention to one of the main problems in the
Contraloria’s analysis: how to calculate the existence and amount of damage
caused to the State in a long-term contract.

1465. As Ms. Tovar Silva explains, in this type of contract there is a possibility that losses
in one year are set-off by gains in succeeding years — making the calculation more
uncertain. To solve this difficulty, Ms. Tovar Silva decided to focus on the one-year
“periodo de transicién” foreseen in the Eighth Amendment, which in her opinion
“se ha consolidado plenamente”, and then to calculate the damage as the loss of
income suffered by the Republic in that period — disregarding all possible events in
subsequent years.

Clarifications by Ms. Tovar Silva

1466. As a consequence of Prodeco’s challenge to the Tovar Silva Report, on 29 October
2012, the Contraloria asked Ms. Tovar Silva to provide clarifications. !?74
Accordingly, on 9 November 2012, Ms. Tovar Silva explained that she had
examined the impact of the Eighth Amendment on the State’s finances only during
the Transition Period because this was the only period for which there was actual
data.'?”> This is her precise explanation: '?7°

“[...] es de aclarar que en el caso de regalias se tomé este periodo, que
coincide con el definido contractualmente como “periodo de transicién” en
el numeral 14.3 de la Cldusula Décima Cuarta del Contrato 044-89, en razén
a_que es el periodo en el que se encontraban materializados los_hechos
eneradores de regalias y contrapre ie icas; y a que dentro de
la Indagaci6n Preliminar correspondiente al Auto No. 000720 del 19 de
octubre de 2010 y a la fecha de elaboraci6n del informe de apoyo tecnico | se
cont tini con los soportes de los embarques debid
y reportados por C.I. Prodeco aI inas de los cuatro (4) trimestres de
2010 [...]”. [Emphasis added, bold in the original]

 

b. The Transition Period

1467. The “periodo de transicidn” is defined in clause 3 of the Eighth Amendment. This
clause amended the agreed procedure for the calculation of Royalties and provided
anew formula.

1468. Under the new pricing formula, on each given date the Coal Reference Price is
established by considering not only the FOB Price on such date, but also the FOB
Prices in the previous 18 months, weighted by Prodeco’s sales in the respective
periods, on the basis of annual weighting coefficients, established ex ante (before
15 January of each year) by an independent auditor. The auditor must be appointed
by Ingeominas at the end of October of each year, and the auditor’s weightings are
applied throughout the next year.

298

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1469. This new system created a difficulty: how to determine the weighting coefficient
for the first year, a period preceding the appointment of the independent auditor.

1470.To solve this problem, Clause 3 of the Eighth Amendment includes the following
sub-section:

Periodo de Transicion: Toda vez que la aplicacién de la formula indicada en el presente
otrosi, implicaria la utilizacién de indices anteriores a la fecha de suscripcién del mismo, se
hace necesario establecer un periodo de transicién. Por lo tanto entre la fecha de inicio de
vigencia del presente otrosi y el 31 de diciembre de 2010, el cdlculo de las regalias de que
trata el numeral 14.1 se haré tomando como precio FOB de referencia el resultado de la
siguiente formula:

     

 

   

PER (m) = 0.3333 x ICRim.s) + 0.3333 x ICRiw-6) + 0.3334 x ICRimy

 

EI precio asi determinado se ajustara al poder calorifico de cada embarque del mes (m, Para
ello se tomara el poder calorifico certificado, de conformidad con lo dispuesto en el numeral
14.5 de la Clausula Décima Cuarta del Contrato. Dicho precio para el periodo de transicién no
seri objeto de ajuste retroactivo con base en el concepto de la auditoria que se emita en enero
de 2011; por lo que el primer ajuste retroactivo al que se refiere este numeral 14.3 se efectuard
con base en el concepto de la auditoria que se emita en enero de 2012.

 

  

1471.The solution agreed upon by the parties to solve the lack of auditor consisted in
establishing a periodo de transicién during the first year of the Eighth Amendment
(i.e. during the year 2010). During this Transition Period the parties agreed that

- the weighting coefficients would be a fixed factor of 0.333; and

- these coefficients were to be applied to the FOB Price applicable three, six, and
nine months before each determination date.

1472.Once the Transition Period elapsed at the end of 2010, the standard system of
weighting would apply, using those established ex ante by the independent auditor,
who was to be appointed at the end of 2010.

ce. Discussion

1473.Claimants say that the Contraloria’s calculation of damages constitutes an
unreasonable or arbitrary measure in violation of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty. !?77

1474. The Tribunal agrees.

1475.The determination of the existence and quantum of damages made by the
Contraloria in its Decision is biased, contrary to basic principles of legal reasoning
and financial logic, and incompatible with the standard of conduct which Colombia
undertook to provide to protected Swiss investors under Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.

1476. The Tribunal is mindful of its own majority conclusions, namely that the standard

for labelling the conduct of a State as unreasonable or arbitrary should be high, and

27” CI, para. 259(d)(ii).

299

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

that regulatory agencies, when performing the mission entrusted to them by law,
should enjoy a high level of deference. !?”8

1477. But even applying these reinforced thresholds, the conclusion does not change. The

calculation of damages is arbitrary and unreasonable. !?”°

1478. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has found the following arguments to be

compelling:

(i) Failure to Update and Improve the Tovar-Silva Report

1479. First, the Contraloria’s Decision expressly states that the basis for the calculation

of damages is the Tovar-Silva Report — a report which had been prepared four years
before, at the start of the investigation, and a few months after the Transition Period
had ended. It is difficult to understand why the Contraloria failed to update the
Report by integrating and evaluating the market and production data that had been
generated since the Report was first written.

(ii) Flaws in the Methodology

1480.Second, the methodology applied by the Tovar-Silva Report is of startling

1481.

simplicity: Ms. Tovar Silva simply calculated

- (i) the Royalties which Colombia would have received during the Transition
Period applying the formula agreed upon before the Eighth Amendment, and

- (ii) those which it actually received applying the formula agreed upon in the
Eighth Amendment.

The calculation was performed for the 12 months of the year 2010 (except for the
Additional Royalties, where the calculation was from November 2009 through
November 2010). The difference between both calculations was the amount of
damage that Colombia was found to have incurred.

First explanation

Ms. Tovar Silva herself was aware of the weakness of her methodology. She
understood that in long-term contracts like the Mining Contract, which was to run
until 2032, it is legally improper and financially illogical to base the calculation of
damages exclusively on the results for the first year in the life of the agreement.

1278 Arbitrator Garibaldi does not agree with the conclusions to which this paragraph refers, for the reasons

stated

in footnote 1269.

1279 Arbitrator Garibaldi agrees with this conclusion, on the ground that the calculation of damages is
arbitrary and unreasonable to the point of shocking, or at least surprising, a sense of juridical propriety.

300

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1482.To solve this problem, in her report Ms. Tovar Silva gave the following
reasoning: !8°

“[...] de acuerdo con las directrices institucionales el daiio causado habré de
ser determinable y por extensién cuantificable, situacién que en los contratos
de tracto sucesivo se diluye ante la posibilidad de compensacién de cargas
contractuales, pero que en el caso objeto de estudio se_ha_consolidado
plenamente como dais por haber vencido el término definido por las partes
como ‘periodo de transicién”’. [Emphasis added]

1483. The sole argument proffered by Ms. Tovar Silva, to justify her use of the one-year
“periodo de transicién” was that

“Tel dafio causado] se ha consolidado plenamente como dajios por haber
vencido el término definido por las partes como ‘periodo de transicion’”.

1484. This argument is difficult to follow. Once the one-year term agreed upon by the
parties passed, the Transition Period expired. This is self-evident. What remains
unexplained is why this self-evident occurrence should produce the effect that the
damage allegedly suffered is “fully consolidated” as damages.

Second Explanation

1485.In November 2012, Ms. Tovar Silva was asked by the Contraloria to provide a
second report, clarifying her initial findings. In this supplementary report, Ms.
Tovar Silva explained that she had examined the impact of the Eighth Amendment
on the State’s finances only during the Transition Period because this was the only
period for which there was actual data. '?*! This is her precise explanation: !?°

“[...] es de aclarar que en el caso de regalias se tomé este periodo, que
coincide con el definido contractualmente como “periodo de transicién” en
el numeral 14.3 de la Cldusula Décima Cuarta del Contrato 044-89, en razén
a_que es el periodo en el que se encontrabi materi lizados_los_hechos
eneradores de regalias y contrapre ie icas; y a que dentro de
la Indagacion Preliminar correspondiente al Auto No. 000720 del 19 de
octubre de 2010 y a la fecha de elaboraci6n del informe de apoyo tecnico se
conto uni con los soportes de los embarques debidc
y reportados por C.l. Prodeco aI inas en los cuatro (4) trimestres de

2010 [...]”. [Emphasis added, bold in the original]

1486.In other words: Ms. Tovar Silva used the data from the Transition Period simply
because these were the only available when she issued her Report in March 2011.

301

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

The Tribunal’s Opinion

1487.Ms. Tovar Silva failed to submit any remotely persuasive argument justifying her
position, i.e. that the relevant period for the calculation of damages should be
limited to the Transition Period.

1488. Within the structure of the Eighth Amendment, the Transition Period does not
represent a time segment with a separate content. Prodeco’s and Ingeominas’
obligations during the Transition Period are the same as those during the remainder
of the Contract life. So is the methodology for calculating the Coal Price.

1489. The raison d’étre for the Transition Period is ancillary. The calculation of the Coal
Reference Price requires that certain weighting coefficients be verified ex ante by
an independent auditor. Ingeominas had not designated such auditors when the
Eighth Amendment was executed in January of 2010. To solve this timing issue,
the parties simply agreed to take three quarterly readings during 2010, and to give
equal weight to each of them.

1490. Summing up, neither the Tovar-Silva Report, nor the Contraloria’s Decision, nor
the Reconsideration Decision, nor the Appeal Decision proffer any reasonable
justification explaining why the one-year Transition Period, defined in the Eighth
Amendment to solve the delay in Ingeominas’ designating an independent auditor,
should have any impact at all on the methodology used to calculate the damages
suffered by Colombia as a consequence of Prodeco’s actions.

(iii) Failure to Use Simulations

1491. Third, if damage is not to to be assessed at the very end of a long-term contract, the
proper methodology for establishing damages prior to that time must be forward-
looking and take into account the total duration of the agreement.

1492. This does not imply that the calculation cannot be performed until the end of the
contract. It is also possible to run one or more simulations of the future development
of a long-term contract, to make comparisons between different scenarios, and to
discount the predicted cash flows to a common date. This was acknowledged by
Ingeominas in its letter to Prodeco dated 12 June 2009, where it undertook to
evaluate the interests of the Nation, measured in terms of “the net present value” of
the project in its integrity. !7*>

1493.In the course of the Hearing, Dra. Vargas was specifically asked by the Tribunal
whether the Contraloria had followed the approach of using simulations. Her
answer was that the economists within the Contraloria had indeed performed such
simulations and that they were included in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. '!7** If
such simulations were indeed performed, it is totally incomprehensible why the

283 Doc. R-110, p. 1.

302

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

Decision failed to take them into account, and instead settled for the deeply flawed
calculation used in the Tovar-Silva Report.

(iv) Additional Investment and Expansion of the Mine

1494. Fourth, the methodology for calculation of damages used in the Contraloria’s
Decision is not only unreasonable; it is also biased.

1495.The proven facts show that, as a quid pro quo for the reduction of the Royalties,
Prodeco undertook the obligation to carry out additional investments and to expand
the capacity of the Mine.

1496. The evidence is compelling:

- Considerando 6 of the Eighth Amendment makes a reference to the fact that its
execution guarantees “Ja viabilidad de la expansion del proyecto minero”;

- Mr. Nagle, Prodeco’s CEO, said in his deposition that the investments and
production levels projected in the 2010 PTI were “negotiation commitment(s)”
that “led to them [Ingeominas] agreeing and us [Prodeco] agreeing to this
Otrost’?;!?85

- The final piece of evidence comes from former Minister Martinez Torres
himself; he confirmed in his deposition before the Tribunal that through the
Eighth Amendment, Prodeco committed to increase production of the Mine
beyond 8 MTA. !8°

1497. The precise increase in investment was not formalized in the Eighth Amendment,
but rather in the 2010 PTI, a quasi-contractual document, proposed by Prodeco and
approved by Ingeominas, which included all the relevant figures.

1498. A simple comparison between the 2006 PTI and the 2010 PTI shows the additional
investment and expansion promised by Prodeco, and the additional Royalties which
it was expected Ingeominas would receive: !7°7

 

 

 

 

2006 PTI 2010 PTI
Mine-life production 116 MT 254 MT
Mine-life investment USD 1,184 M USD 1,477 M
Mine-life Royalties USD 671M USD 1,782 M

303

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1499. To be proper, any calculation of damages must take into account the expansion of
the Mine undertaken by Prodeco in exchange for the reduction of the Royalties, and
the impact that such expansion would cause on the Royalties earned by Ingeominas.

1500.It is not appropriate to compare — as the Contraloria did — the Royalties which
Ingeominas is receiving applying the Eighth Amendment vis-a-vis those it would
have received if the Eighth Amendment had not been executed.

1501.The proper comparison is between

- the Royalties which Prodeco would have paid, under the original Mining
Contract (i.e. excluding the Eighth Amendment), assuming the production of
coal deriving from the 2006 PTI, and

- the Royalties Prodeco undertook to pay under the Eighth Amendment, assuming
the increased production foreseen in the 2010 PTI.

1502.The methodology used in the Contraloria’s Decision totally disregarded the fact
that, under the 2010 PTI, Prodeco assumed an obligation to increase its investment
and to expand the Mine, resulting in an increased production of coal. Any
evenhanded and fair calculation of the damage suffered by Colombia cannot obviate
this commitment — especially because the proven facts show that Prodeco not only
achieved the levels of investment promised in the 2010 PTI, but even substantially
exceeded them.!?8* These levels of investment led to an increase in the amount of
coal mined, and eventually to an increase in the Royalties paid to Colombia. '?°?

1503.In essence, the Contraloria’s Decision blew hot and cold at the same time:

-  Tocalculate the roayalties owed, it took into consideration increased production
of coal resulting from the expansion of the mine;

- But it disregarded the financial effort made by Prodeco precisely to find those
increased levels of production.

d. Decision

1504. Summing up, Claimants argue that the Contraloria’s decision, establishing that the
Eighth Amendment had caused damage to Colombia, is arbitrary and unreasonable.
The Tribunal finds that the methodology on which the Contraloria based its
decision to establish the damages allegedly caused to Colombia under the Eighth
Amendment was indeed arbitrary and unreasonable. The level of arbitrariness and

unreasonability is high and cannot be protected by the deference accorded to state
agencies when performing supervisory tasks entrusted by law. '?”

1505. The Tribunal recalls, however, that the standard to be applied under Art. 4(1) of
the Treaty is “unreasonable measures”, not “arbitrary measures”. Consequently, the
finding of arbitrariness has in itself no effects under the Treaty, except to the extent
that, as already pointed out, arbitrariness implies unreasonableness. Therefore, the
Tribunal finds that Colombia adopted an unreasonable measure, which impaired the
investment in Colombia belonging to a protected Swiss investor, in breach of Art.
4(1) of the Treaty.

C. Dolo

1506.Claimants submit that the Contraloria’s Decision was unreasonable when it found
that Prodeco acted wilfully to cause damage to the State; while the Republic argues
the contrary: that in a well-reasoned decision the Contraloria found that Prodeco, a
collaborator of the State, incurred in conducta dolosa and thus managed to reduce
the compensation owed to Ingeominas.

1507. The Tribunal will first explore the concept of dolo in Colombian law (a.), it will
then summarize the Contraloria’s findings with regard to Prodeco’s dolo (b.), and
finally it will analyse whether the finding of dolo in the Contraloria’s Decision can
be labelled as arbitrary or unreasonable (c.).

a. The Concept of Dolo

1508.Art. 5 of Law 610 of 2000 defines the requirements for incurring in fiscal
liability: !2°!

 

“La responsabilidad fiscal estard integrada por los siguientes elementos:

- Una conducta dolosa o culposa atribuible a una persona que realiza gestién
fiscal.

- Un dafio patrimonial al Estado.

- Un nexo causal entro los dos elementos anteriores”.

1509. The first requirement is dolo. !?°?

1290 Arbitrator Garibaldi agrees with the conclusions reached in this paragraph (as well as the supporting
analysis) but not, for the reasons set forth in footnote 1269, with the reference to “deference accorded to
state agencies”.

1291 Doc, C-71, Art. 5.
122 Or culpa. There is no discussion in the present case that Prodeco might have incurred in culpa.

 

305

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1510. As Law 610 does not contain an independent definition of dolo, the meaning of this
concept must be sought in the general principles of law.'? Art. 63 of the Civil
Code defines dolo:'?°*

“El dolo consiste en la intencién positiva de inferir injuria a la persona o
propiedad de otro”.

1511.This notion of dolo, enshrined in the Civil Code, has been formally adopted by the
Contraloria (and by the Consejo de Estado when reviewing such decisions) '?°; but
in the fiscal liability decisions the interpretation given by the Contraloria has been
expansive, and has tended to connect dolo with the contractor’s fiduciary duties
towards the State (blurring the distinction between dolo and culpa, the alternative
requirement for the existence of fiscal liability).

1512.In its leading case, Decisién 015, the Contraloria followed this approach, stressing
the contractor’s duty to defend the funcidn social of the public contract: '?9°

“Pregunta [el Sr. Cabrera] dénde esta la mala fe, se le responde que es
i en esa actitud ina y de desapego en donde esta la mala fe
en_donde_esté_el_dolo, su_mala_intenci6n_de_aprovecharse_de_unas
i erradas para sacar mayor provecho y mayor lucro del que las
reglas del mercado en ese momento le estaban ofreciendo.

Es precisamente su conducta dolosa, su engaiio, de aprovecharse_de las
condici ofrecidas por la Camara de R para _contratar, de
transgredir su funcién social que como contratista del Estado le obligaba a
cumplir, que se le endilga y se le impone responsabilidad fiscal”. [Emphasis
added]

1513.Mr. Cabrera, the private individual who had contracted with the public
administration, had delivered paper at the price offered by the Camara de los
Diputados, but the Contraloria found that he had acted with dolo, because he should
have known that the price was excessive, and by not denouncing the situation he
breached the “funcidn social” which he was bound to respect as a state contractor.

b. The Contraloria’s Finding of Dolo
(i) | The Contraloria’s Decision

1514.The Contraloria’s Decision was issued in April 2015 and confirmed that Prodeco
had incurred fiscal responsibility based on dolo.

1515.The starting point of the Contraloria’s analysis was that Prodeco had wilfully
permitted damage to the State’s financial interests, in order to obtain more benefits,

thereby acting with dolo.'?°” Although the Contraloria recognized that any private
contractor had the right to receive benefits from its economic activity, it found that
it was improper for a contractor to try to receive higher benefits to the detriment of
the State’s interests. !?°*

1516.The Contraloria additionally found that Prodeco had put in place a series of
manoeuvres to pay a lower compensation to the State, !?°? in particular: !7°°

“El grado de culpabilidad que se le ha endilgado a PRODECO no se basa en
la intenci6n legitima de impedir o detener pérdidas, ni en la obtencién de
mayores ingresos, circunstancias que por st solas no constituyen
irregularidad alguna, como bien lo ha dicho el apoderado. Se fundamenta en
la serie de das por PRODECO que se materializan, en

‘a. mds adelante, sin que se hubiese determinado de forma
y término para ello, salvo enunciados abstractos y genéricos”. [Emphasis

1517. The Contraloria added that Prodeco was Ingeominas’ “collaborator”: '*"!

“Pasa por alto el sefior apoderado que PRODECO tiene una relacién
contractual sui generis, producto del contrato estatal suscrito mediante el
cual se busca el cumplimiento de los fines del Estado, vinculo juridico en el
que esta involucrado el interés general, y por tal raz6n, adquirié la calidad o
condicion de ‘colaborador’ en el cumplimiento de tales fines”.

1518.The Contraloria concluded that Prodeco had indeed incurred in dolo and justified

its decision with the following argument: 7°?

“Asi las cosas, como se puede deducir de las pruebas, PRODECO desarrollo
una serie de maniobras con el fin de obtener la disminucién de las
contraprestaciones econémicas, maniobras de las cuales se desprende, entre
otras circunstancias, que esta firma queria obtener el resultado sin parar en

contratante (INGEOMINAS) como un particular, por lo que su conducta se
califica de manera definitiva a titulo de DOLO.” [Emphasis added]

(ii) Reconsideration Decision

1519.In July 2015, the Contralora Delegada rejected Prodeco’s recurso de
reposicion.

1520. The Reconsideration Decision insisted that Prodeco was a collaborator of the public
administration and that the contractual relationship with the State implied a
heightened responsibility for Prodeco.!*°*

1521.Finally, in an extensive sub-section the Reconsideration Decision gave a further
explanation of the reasons which led to the Contraloria’s conclusion that Prodeco
had acted with dolo. 5

1522.First, the Reconsideration Decision details the manoeuvres which gave rise to
dolo:'3

- First, in fabricating interpretative differences and forcing Ingeominas to the
negotiation table;

- Second, in presenting successive alternatives, once the previous alternative had
been rejected by Ingeominas;

- Third, in submitting different alternatives, which all implied a reduction of the
income for the state.

1523. The conclusion is the following: °°”

“Ahora, gen qué consiste el dolo entonces en este caso? Tanto PRODECO
como algunos funcionarios de INGEOMINAS estaban tan conscientes que
una disminuci6on en las regalias ya pactadas en el contrato era lesivo [sic] a
los intereses patrii iales del Estado, que _tuvieron_que_acudir_a_un
argumento como un mayor volumen de explotacién cuando ni_siquiera se
habia alcanzado el volumen acordado en el contrato inicial. Tal propuesta
necesariamente tendria que parecer razonable en la medida que para la
mayor explotacion se requeriria, segiin los argumentos de los implicados una
mayor inversion. Pero es de advertir que tampoco esa mayor produccién ni
Ja inversion se dio en el periodo de transici6n tal como se soporté en fallo”.
[Emphasis added]

 

 

1524. The Reconsideration Decision thus gives a different reasoning to support its finding
of dolo: Prodeco and Ingeominas were aware that a reduction of Royalties would
injure the interests of the State. Consequently, Prodeco and Ingeominas had to resort

to the argument of a higher production, when the volume agreed upon in the initial
Contract had been achieved. But this higher production and investment did not
materialize during the Transition Period.

(iii) Appeal Decision

1525.In August 2015, the Contralor General de la Repiiblica issued the Appeal Decision
in the recurso de apelacion, confirming the Contraloria’s Decision. '*°

1526. As to the issue of dolo, the Contralor General noted the following:

1527.First, Prodeco, by signing a contract with the public administration, became its
collaborator and entered into a special relationship. °°

1528.Second, Prodeco failed to adhere to this heightened level of responsibility. It
imposed its desire to obtain profits over the collective interests of society, and it
took advantage of the institutional frailty of Ingeominas.'*!”

1529.Third, the characterization of Prodeco’s conduct as dolosa in the Contraloria’s
Decision was accurate. '*!! There were two fundamental reasons why Prodeco acted
with dolo:

 

- Its actions showed “wna intencién de incrementar ilegitimamente sus ganancias
derivadas del negocio, sin hacer un minimo esfuerzo por armonizarlas con los
intereses estatales, obligacion que se deriva de su condicion de colaborador de
la administraci6n”;

- Additionally, dolo derives from the fact that Prodeco resorted to the argument
that it would increase its investments and the volume of coal mined, but such
increases did not materialize during the Transition Period (i.e. during the year
2010).137

ce. Discussion
1530.The question before the Tribunal is whether the finding of the Contraloria that
Prodeco acted with dolo constitutes an “unreasonable measure”, which impairs

Claimants’ use and enjoyment of its investment and violates Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.

1531. Art. 63 of the Civil Code provides the general definition of dolo in Colombian law

  

— a definition which is also relevant for the purposes of establishing fiscal
liability: 35

“El dolo consiste en la intencién positiva de in
propiedad de otro”.

erir injuria a la persona o

1532.Dolo is thus intimately associated with the actor’s intention of causing harm or
damage to the counterparty or its assets.

Fiscal Liability Proceeding

1533.In the various decisions adopted in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, the Contraloria
developed three separate lines of reasoning to support its finding of dolo; all three
are based on Prodeco’s alleged intention of reducing its Royalty payments, thus
causing damage to the Republic:

- In the Auto de Imputacién the Contraloria finds that Prodeco had acted “a
sabiendas de que con esta modificacién se disminuirian los ingresos” for the
State;'>"* the Contraloria’s Decision took up the same argument, adding that as
a collaborator of the State, Prodeco had a heightened responsibility in avoiding
that the State suffers damages; '7!°

- The Decision also argued that Prodeco had had carried out “a number of
maneuvers” to achieve a reduction in Royalties and to maximize its own
profits; '3!6

- The Reconsideration Decision reiterated and further developed the argument
that Prodeco had carried out manoeuvres with the aim of causing damage to the
financial interests of the State,'>!” but then gave a twist to the argument: the dolo
consisted in that Prodeco promised an increase in production and investment,
but that increase had not materialized during the Transition Period. '?!*

1534. The three lines of reasoning developed by the Contraloria require, as a condition
for the existence of dolo, that Prodeco sought to cause damage to the Republic by
reducing its Royalty payments. The Contraloria’s position echoes Art. 63 of the
Civil Code, which defines dolo by reference to the intention of causing harm or
damage to a person or its assets.

1535.In the previous section, the Tribunal has already established that, as regards the
determination of damages, the Contraloria’s Decision constituted an unreasonable
measure, in breach of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty. The Contraloria has thus failed to
prove that the execution of the Eighth Amendment caused any damage to Colombia.

1536. The Tribunal is now called to decide whether the Contraloria’s finding that Prodeco
acted with dolo also implied an unreasonable measure, contrary to Art. 4(1) of the
Treaty.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

In the present case, there is no certainty that Prodeco’s conduct caused any damage
to the Republic. Since no damage has been validly established, the question whether
Prodeco acted with dolo, i.e. with the intention to cause damage to the Republic,
and whether in so finding the Contraloria acted unreasonably, is moot. Such
question will only become relevant if and when the Contraloria properly
determines that the Eighth Amendment actually was harmful to the interests of the
Republic.

D. Legitimate Expectations to a Non-Arbitrary and Not Unreasonable
Application of the Fiscal Control Regime

Pro memoria: Claimants allege that:

- they had legitimate expectations that the fiscal control regime, if applied to

Prodeco, would be applied fairly, that is, in applying the criteria of liability of
that regime the Contraloria would not act in an abusive, improper, or
unreasonable manner, and that

- the Contraloria frustrated those expectations, in breach of Art. 4(2) of the

1539.

1540.

(3)

1541.

Treaty.

The Tribunal postponed consideration of this claim, because the issue rests on
considerations that largely coincide with those best examined in respect of the claim
based on unreasonable measures.

The Tribunal has found that the Contraloria applied an unreasonable methodology
to establish the damages allegedly caused to Colombia by the Eighth Amendment
and, accordingly, Respondent took an unreasonable measure that impaired
Claimants’ investment, in violation of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty. In light of this
conclusion, the analysis of Claimants’ remaining claim for breach of Art. 4(2) can
be brief.

The Tribunal considers that, although Claimants did not have legitimate
expectations that the fiscal liability regime would not be applicable to Prodeco, they
did have legitimate expectations that the regime, if applied at all, would be applied
in a reasonable manner. Since the Contraloria’s finding of damage caused by
Prodeco to the State was unreasonable, Claimants’ legitimate expectations were
frustrated. In this respect, then, the Contraloria’s actions also breached the FET
standard of Art. 4(2) of the Treaty.

THE ALLEGED RESPONSIBILITY OF COLOMBIA ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT
OF THE SGC/ANM

Claimants submit that, apart from their claim based on the conduct of the
Contraloria, Colombia incurred responsibility as a consequence of the conduct of
the SGC/ANM. The conduct of the SGC/ANM that allegedly gave rise to such
responsibility was filing the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with the
Colombian courts:

311

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

 

 

- First, Claimants submit that the conduct of the SGC/ANM breached their
legitimate expectations: such conduct directly contradicted the express
representation given by Ingeominas in the Eighth Amendment, stating that such
Amendment was in the interest of the State; !3!?

 

- Second, Claimants also argue that the SGC/ANM has conducted itself in an
inconsistent, arbitrary, unpredictable, and non-transparent manner, because the
Eighth Amendment induced Prodeco to make investments and expand the Mine,
and the Mining Agency is now reneging on the commitments assumed
therein. '32°

1542.Respondent counters that the filing of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment
involves an ordinary legal recourse to state courts, which cannot be contrary to
Claimants’ legitimate expectations. Absent denial of justice, which Claimants are
not pleading, it is no breach of the FET standard to submit a contract for
nullification by the courts.'37!

Facts

1543. Pursuant to clause 39, the Mining Contract is subject to Colombian law and to the
jurisdiction of the Colombian courts.'*?* Colombian courts are thus empowered to
adjudicate all disputes arising out of the Mining Contract — including any dispute
as regards the validity of the Contract or of its Amendments.

1544.On 30 March 2012, after an unsuccessful request for mandatory conciliation, the
SGC filed the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca, invoking clause 39 of the Mining Contract. The
SGC requested that the court declare the nullity of the Eighth Amendment, arguing
that such Amendment was detrimental to the general interest of the State: the
Amendment had been executed on the assumption that it would generate benefits
for the State, but this scenario had not materialized. '*?3

1545. Subsidiarily, the SGC requested that the Tribunal Administrativo revise the Eighth
Amendment, “de tal manera que se preserve el interés general, recuperando y
manteniendo a un futuro el equilibrio de la ecuaci6n financiera del Contrato
044/89, perdido con el desarrollo del Otrosi No. 8”.

1546.It is undisputed that in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment the Tribunal
Administrativo de Cundinamarca has not issued a decision on the merits of the

case, 324

Discussion

1547.The Tribunal finds for Respondent: the filing of the Procedure for Contractual
Annulment does not constitute a violation of Art. 4 of the Treaty.

1548.Claimants say that their legitimate expectations have been breached (A.), and that
the conduct of the SGC/ANM was unreasonable (B.). The Tribunal considers these
arguments to be without merit.

A. Legitimate Expectations

1549.The conduct imputed to the SGC/ANM simply consists in the filing of the
Procedure for Contractual Annulment, an action before the domestic court with
jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising from the Mining Contract. The
SGC/ANM is entitled to do so under clause 39 of the Contract.

1550. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the conduct of the SGC/ANM does not breach Claimants’
legitimate expectations: Colombia never made any representation or gave any
assurance to Claimants that its Mining Agency would abstain from enforcing such
rights as it might have under the Contract or under Colombian law.

1551. It is true that Ingeominas executed, registered and initially complied with the Eighth
Amendment, while its successor organizations are now seeking annulment of the
Amendment before the Colombian courts. It is also true that in Considerando 6
Ingeominas represented that “con el presente acuerdo se garantizan los intereses
del Estado”.

1552. But the execution of a contract, even if such contract includes a representation that
it is valid and binding, does not create a legitimate expectation that, if subsequently
one of the parties discovers that an alleged cause for annulment pre-existed or has
arisen, such party will abstain from raising a dispute in the proper forum. To
understand the contrary would lead to the untenable general conclusion that actions
requesting annulment of a contract are barred because such actions will breach the
counter-party’s legitimate expectations.

B. Arbitrariness or Unreasonableness

1553.Claimants also submit that the SGC/ANM’s conduct was arbitrary and
unreasonable.

1554. The Tribunal does not share this opinion.

1555.Under the Mining Contract, the SGC/ANM is obligated to submit disputes to the
jurisdiction of the Colombian courts. It is a fact that a dispute has arisen: the
SGC/ANM now takes the view that the Mining Contract executed by Ingeominas
is null and void (or subsidiarily that it must be revised). In such case, the proper
conduct, in accordance with the very provisions of the Contract, is to submit the
case to adjudication in the agreed forum. That is precisely what the SGC/ANM has
done - as it was entitled to and obliged under the Mining Contract.

313

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1556. There is a second argument. The Colombian courts have not yet ruled on the merits
in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment. Consequently, there can be no
argument that Claimants have already suffered a denial of justice — and Claimants
acknowledge that no claim for denial of justice is being pursued in this
procedure. !??

1557.Respondent says that, absent an action tantamount to denial of justice, it is no breach
of FET to submit a contract for nullification before the proper court.'*?° The
Tribunal concurs: the mere filing by the SGC/ANM of the Procedure for
Contractual Annulment cannot give rise to a violation of Art. 4 of the Treaty.

1558. It is important to note that the conduct of SGC/ANM of which Claimants complain
is merely filing with the competent Colombian court a claim for the annulment of
the Eighth Amendment. As the Colombian judiciary has not made a decision on the
matter, Claimants cannot (and in fact do not) make a claim for breach of the FET
standard in the form of denial of justice. And since the Eighth Amendment has not
been annulled, but remains in full force and effect, Claimants have suffered no
damage attributable to the actions of the Colombian judiciary or the filing of the
claim for annulment by the SGC/ANM.

VII. REPARATION

1559.In this section, the Tribunal must establish the reparation to which Claimants are
entitled to offset the effects of Colombia’s international wrong on Claimants’
investment. The Tribunal will first briefly summarize the Parties’ positions ((1) and
(2)) and will then decide the issue (3).

(1) CLAIMANTS’ PosITION

1560. Claimants are claiming by way of restitution an order that Respondent: '27

- repay to Prodeco the Fiscal Liability Amount, and

- any other sums that Colombia may, up to the date of the Award, have ordered
Prodeco to pay by way of Royalties or GIC calculated on the basis that the Eighth
Amendment should not apply,

1561.They are also claiming as compensation that the above payments be:

- adjusted from the date of payment to the time of the date of the award at an
annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually.

(2) RESPONDENT’S POSITION

1562.Respondent says that Claimants cannot be compensated for the Fiscal Liability
Amount paid for three reasons:

- First, because Claimants and their legal advisors have expressed their utmost
confidence that the Contraloria Decision will be revoked and Prodeco will be
fully reimbursed for the amount paid; this has been stated in Prodeco’s 2015
financial statements; '378

- Second, even if the judicial recourse against the Contraloria’s Decision were
not successful, Prodeco could recover the amounts paid from the Government
officers who were held jointly and severally liable by the Contraloria; Prodeco’s
failure to do so is contrary to its duty to mitigate damages; !*”°

- Third, Prodeco could have requested the suspension of the effects of the
Contraloria’s Decision, which would have enabled them to delay payment until
a decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment is rendered. !*°°

 

1563.Finally, Respondent argues that any recovery by Claimants must be significantly
reduced to reflect Claimants’ contribution to their own losses. Claimants’ behaviour

materially contributed to the losses, providing Ingeominas with misleading
information, influencing Ingeominas’ Director Ballesteros and breaching
mandatory procedures for amending Contratos de Gran Mineria.'**!

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

1564.The Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the Contraloria applied an

unreasonable and arbitrary methodology to establish the damages allegedly suffered
by Colombia due to the execution of the Eighth Amendment. This conduct of the
Contraloria is attributable to the Republic of Colombia and implies a violation of
Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. !**?

1565.The Tribunal must now determine the appropriate reparation for Claimants’ loss.

A, The Standard of Full Reparation

1566. The legal standard which the Tribunal must apply is not disputed by the Parties: it

is the principle of full reparation of the injury caused, firmly established in
jurisprudence since the PCIJ’s seminal Chorzéw Factory decision.'*7> The PCU
held that full reparation was an essential and consistent principle of customary
international law and should be applied even in the absence of any specific
provision setting forth an indemnification obligation in the treaty underlying the
dispute: 34

“Tt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves
an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore is
the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention and there is
no necessity for this to be stated in the convention itself.”

1567. The principle of full reparation, as adopted by the Chorzéw Factory decision, was

subsequently codified in the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on the
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts [“ILC Articles”].'**°

1568. Art. 11(1) of the Treaty permits an investor to claim for breaches of the Treaty if

those breaches cause “loss or damage to him or his investment”. However, the only
compensation standard expressly set out in the Treaty is that for lawful
expropriation (Art. 6). The Treaty provides no compensation formula for non-
expropriatory breaches of the Treaty. This gap must be covered applying customary
international law, and, to the extent possible, extending by analogy certain rules,
which the Treaty provides for expropriation, to other violations.

1569.Customary international law rules on reparation for breaches of international law
are set out in the ILC Articles'*°,

1570.Art. 31 of the ILC Articles states the principle that the injury caused by
internationally wrongful acts must give rise to full reparation'**’:

“1, The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the
injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the
internationally wrongful act of a State.”

1571.This principle of full reparation has been consistently applied by investment
tribunals — including in cases of non-expropriatory breaches !°8.

Restitution

1572.Pursuant to Art. 35 of the ILC Articles, restitution - as opposed to compensation -
is the first of the forms of reparation available to a party injured by an internationally
wrongful act. It involves the re-establishment, as far as possible, of the situation
which existed prior to to the commission of the internationally wrongful act:

“A State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation
to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before
the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent that restitution:

(a) is not materially impossible;

(b) does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from
restitution instead of compensation.”

Discussion

1573.Claimants’ basic claim is straightforward: Claimants request that, by way of
restitution, Colombia repay to Prodeco de Fiscal Liability Amount, which is the
only amount that Prodeco paid to the Contraloria.

1574. The Tribunal agrees.

1575. Respondent’s treaty breach — the Contraloria’s wrongful calculation of the damage
caused by the execution of the Eighth Amendment — resulted in Prodeco paying to
the Contraloria the Fiscal Liability Amount, on 19 January 2016. Consequently, in
order to re-establish the situation that existed before Colombia violated the Treaty,
the Republic is under an obligation to repay to Prodeco the amount improperly
collected.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1576. The Tribunal notes that in this case restitution is not materially impossible nor does
it impose a disproportionate burden on the party in breach — the two factors which
exclude the possibility of restitution pursuant to Art. 34 of the ILC Articles.

1577.In certain cases, to ensure full reparation restitution must be completed by
compensation. Art. 36 of the ILC Articles provides further guidance”:

“1, The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such
damage is not made good by restitution.

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including
loss of profits insofar as it is established.”

1578. This rule is relevant in this case since the Tribunal must supplement restitution with
compensation in the form of interest in order to achieve full reparation. Claimants’
proven damage resulting from Colombia’s breach of the Treaty is limited to the
payment of the Fiscal Liability Amount (and the payment of interest — a question
addressed in Section VIII infra).

B. Respondent’s Counter-Arguments

1579.Respondent alleges that Claimants should not be awarded the Fiscal Liability
Amount for three reasons:

- That Claimants are confident that the Annulment Procedure will be successful
and, as a result the Contraloria’s Decision will be revoked and Prodeco will be
reimbursed the Fiscal Liability Amount; 1340

-  Prodeco can recover the Fiscal Liability Amount from the government officials
who were held jointly and severally liable by the Contraloria;'*' and

- Claimants could have requested the suspension of the effects of the
Contraloria’s Decision, and this would have enabled Claimants to delay
payment until a decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment but
decided not to do so.'*?

1580. Respondent’s counter-arguments have no merit.

1581.First, whether Claimants are confident that the Annulment Procedure will be
successful and that the Contraloria will reimburse the Fiscal Liability Amount, is
irrelevant. Colombia has committed an international wrong, and Claimants are
entitled to full reparation. The hypothetical future outcome of the Annulment

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Procedure does not affect Claimants’ right hic et nunc to have their existing damage
compensated.

Second, Colombia’s second argument is also without merit. Prodeco may or not
have the right under Colombian law to claim against the civil servants who were
found guilty in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. '*4? But this right, even if it exists,
does not permit Colombia to evade responsibility for its own Treaty breaches.
Based on a demand that has been found to be inconsistent with Colombia’s
international obligations, Prodeco paid the alleged damages to the Contraloria; the
legal consequence under international law is that Claimants are entitled to
restitution of such damages from Colombia, regardless of whether Prodeco may
have an action under Colombian law against the other civil servants, who
incidentally cannot be held responsible for Colombia’s wrongdoing under the
Treaty.

Third, Prodeco took the decision to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount in January
2016, under protest and in order to avoid forfeiture of the Mining Contract: '*+

“De manera expresa aclaro que el pago aludido lo efectué PRODECO con
el tinico proposito de mitigar los efectos asociados a la responsabilidad fiscal
que incorrecta e indebidamente se le atribuyo [...] lo cual de ninguna manera
minimiza, ni afecta y menos puede entenderse como una renuncia a los
argumentos de PRODECO y de sus accionistas [...]”. [Emphasis in the
original]

Prodeco then filed the Annulment Procedure with the tribunal contencioso-
administrativo in April 2016. Respondent’s argument that Prodeco could have
asked the Court for the suspension of the payment is factually wrong: Prodeco had
already paid the Fiscal Liability Amount four months before. Legally, the argument
is irrelevant: the possibility of asking a local judge for the suspension of a payment
does not relieve Colombia from its international-law obligation to repair in full the
harm caused.

Finally, Respondent also argues that any recovery by Claimants must be
significantly reduced to reflect Claimants’ contribution to their own losses.

The argument is without merit. The wrongful act committed by Colombia was the
unreasonable calculation of damage by the Contraloria. Respondent argues that
Claimants’ allegedly contributory behaviour was to provide Ingeominas with
misleading information, to influence Ingeominas’ Director Ballesteros and to
breach mandatory procedures for amending Contratos de Gran Mineria.'*4> These

right is doubtful: Claimants initially added Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Ceballos, and Ms.

Aristizabal as potential co-defendants in their request for annulment filed before Colombian Courts in

March

2016. However, the Court refused to admit Prodeco’s request unless it excluded such parties (see

Doc. R -2, p. 7 and Doc. C-273, p. 7).

assertions remain unproven,'*® but even if proven the alleged facts did not
contribute to Respondent’s wrongful behaviour.

C. Summary

Summing up, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that, by way of restitution for Colombia’s
breach of Arts. 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty, the Republic must repay Prodeco the
Fiscal Liability Amount.

The amount claimed by the Contraloria in its Decision was denominated in COP,
and amounted to COP 60.0 billion. '*4” Prodeco paid this amount, plus 12% interest
accrued until the actual date of payment on 19 January 2016, resulting in a total
amount of COP 63 billion.'*48 In accordance with Claimants’ expert, this amount
in COP equated to USD 19.1 million, based on the exchange rate on the date of
payment.!*“? The calculation is not disputed. Respondent has explicitly accepted
that the amount paid by Prodeco amounted to USD 19.1 million.'*°°

Claimants are asking the Tribunal in its Reply that it order repayment of the Fiscal
Liability Amount denominated in USD.!?5!

Art. 6 of the Treaty says that compensation for expropriation shall be paid in “freely
convertible currency”. This rule can be extended by analogy to compensation due
for other breaches of the Treaty. Claimants ask that the compensation be
denominated in US currency. The USD indeed being the primary “freely
convertible currency” in the world, and Respondent having accepted that the Fiscal
Liability Amount equals USD 19.1 million, the Tribunal sees no difficulty in
accepting the request.

The impact of currency denomination on the calculation of interest will be
addressed in Section VIII infra.

1846 See section V-1.(5) supra.

‘347 The precise amount is COP 60.023.730.368,33; see Doc. C-32.

VIII. INTEREST

1592.Claimants claim pre and post-award interest at a rate equivalent to Prodeco’s cost
of capital as reflected in its WACC, compounded semi-annually, on all amounts
awarded. Respondent does not agree with Claimants’ proposed calculation of the
applicable interest rate. The Tribunal will briefly summarize the Parties’ positions
(1. and 2.) and will render its decision (3.)

(1) CLAIMANTS?’ POSITION

1593. Claimants submit that interest is a component of full compensation under customary
international law. '*°? Claimants explain that a State’s duty to make reparation arises
immediately after its unlawful actions cause harm. Thus, to the extent that payment
is delayed, the investor loses the opportunity to invest the compensation. !*?

1594. Claimants have requested that the Fiscal Liability Amount be adjusted from the date
of payment of such amount to the Colombian authorities until the date of the Award,
at an annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually. '3°+ Claimants also request
post-award interest on the same terms, or at such other rate and compounding period
as the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation. !*°>

1595. According to Claimants, the rate at which interest should accrue must ensure full
reparation; therefore, the applicable rate should be equivalent to the return that
Claimants would have earned had they been able to invest the funds of which they
were deprived. !5° In Claimants’ submission, interest should accrue at Prodeco’s
WACC (calculated by Claimants’ expert to be 8.5% and later updated to 9.69%),
because:

- Claimants’ cost of capital is a reasonable proxy for the return that Claimants
would otherwise have earned on the amounts owed to them as a result of
Colombia’s Treaty breaches;!°” and

- The cost of raising funds to replace the Fiscal Liability Amount is Prodeco’s cost
of capital, not a risk-free rate. 1358

1596. Interest is not an award in addition to reparation, it is rather a component of full
reparation which gives effect to that principle.'*°? This full reparation would not be
achieved if the award were to deprive Claimants of compound interest. For this

reason, Claimants request that any interest awarded be subject to reasonable
compounding. °°

1597.As regards the periodicity of the compounding, Claimants assert, on the basis of
case law, that a commercially reasonable period for compounding both pre-and
post-award interest would be six months. °°!

(2) RESPONDENT’S POSITION

1598.Respondent does not dispute that interest is due in this case but claims that the
applicable interest rate should not be Prodeco’s cost of capital but a risk-free rate.
Moreover, the Tribunal should award simple interest, and if it were to award
compound interest, compounding should be made annually.

1599. Colombia argues that the Tribunal should not use the Project’s WACC to calculate
interest but a risk-free rate because the Fiscal Liability Amount does not represent
an investment (or bore any risk) that warrants compensating them for risk.!*°?
Alternatively, if the Tribunal considers that Claimants should be awarded pre-award
interest at a rate that compensates for risk, interest should be calculated based on
Colombia’s sovereign default risk because by paying the Fiscal Liability Amount
to Colombia, Prodeco has effectively extended a loan to the State. 1363

1600.As regards compounding, although increasingly used in investment arbitration,
Respondent submits that it cannot be considered as a principle of international
law, '3 and it is banned by Art. 2235 of Colombian Civil Code.'3% Thus, Colombia
requests that simple interest is awarded, and if the Tribunal were to award
compound interest, compounding be carried out annually. !*°°

(3) DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

1601.Every decision on interest must distinguish the rate, calculation methodology, dies
a quo, dies ad quem, and principal amount.

1602.Since the Tribunal has determined that the compensation due to Claimants is
equivalent to the Fiscal Liability Amount, i.e. USD 19.1 million, that is the principal
amount.

Rate

1603. Claimants have requested that interest be granted over the Fiscal Liability Amount
from the date of payment at an annual rate of 9.69%, because they consider that

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

Prodeco could have invested the Fiscal Liability Amount in their mining operations,
which would have generated an expected return equal to the cost of capital of the
project. !3°7

1604. Respondent says that, if the Tribunal were to award restitution, interest should be
calculated at a risk-free rate, or alternatively, based on Colombia’s sovereign
default risk.

1605.Art. VI of the BIT provides that compensation for expropriation shall include
“interest at a normal commercial rate”. Although the rule refers to expropriation, it
can be extended by analogy to compensation for violations of other provisions of
the BIT. '36

1606. None of the interest rates proposed by the Parties can be said to fit into the definition
of “normal commercial rates”. Claimants’ proposal that the interest rate be
equivalent to its WACC would over-compensate Prodeco, since it would allow it to
earn a return without bearing commensurate risk. Respondent’s proposal that
interest be calculated applying the short-term rate on US treasury bills also fails to
qualify as “normal commercial rates” — US treasury bills finance the US
Government, not commercial enterprises.

1607. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that LIBOR is the most widely used “normal
commercial rate”, since it is universally accepted as a valid reference for the
calculation of variable interest rates. LIBOR is determined by the equilibrium
between supply and demand, representing the interest rate at which banks can
borrow funds from other banks in the London interbank market; it is fixed daily by
the British Bankers’ Association for different maturities and for different
currencies.

1608. Since the compensation is expressed in USD, the appropriate rate of reference for
the calculation of interest should be the LIBOR rates for six-month deposits
denominated in USD.

1609. Loans to customers invariably include a surcharge, which must be inserted in the
calculation of interest to reflect the financial loss caused to Prodeco by the
temporary withholding of money. Claimants would not be fully compensated if the
interest rate applied did not include an appropriate margin.'* The Tribunal
considers that 2% is a reasonable margin, reflecting the surcharge that an average
borrower would have to pay for obtaining financing based on LIBOR.'?”°

Calculation methodology

1610. Claimants have requested that interest should be compounded semi -annually, while
Respondent proposes that simple interest be applied, alleging that capitalisation is
banned by Art. 2235 of Colombian Civil Code.'*7! Alternatively, Colombia
requests that if the Tribunal were to award compound interest, compounding ought
to be carried out annually. !7

1611.The question whether interest should be accumulated periodically to the principal
has been the subject of diverging decisions in international investment case law.
Older case law!” tended to repudiate this possibility, but more recent case law
tends to accept annual or semi-annual capitalisation of unpaid interest. !>”4

1612.The Tribunal agrees with the more recent decisions. Loan agreements in which
interest is calculated on the basis of LIBOR plus a margin usually include a
provision that unpaid interest must be capitalised at the end of the interest period,
and will thereafter be considered as capital and accrue interest. The financial reason
for this provision is that an unpaid lender has to resort to the LIBOR market in order
to fund the amounts due but defaulted, and the lender’s additional funding costs
have to be covered by the defaulting borrower.

1613.This principle implies that, if Claimants had taken out a LIBOR loan to pay the
Fiscal Liability Amount, the bank would have insisted that unpaid interest be
capitalised at the end of each interest period. Consequently, if Claimants are to be
kept fully indemnified for the harm suffered, interest owed under the Award should
be capitalised at the end of each six-month interest period.

1614. Respondent has alleged that compound interest is prohibited under Art. 2235 of
Colombian Civil Code.!*” The rule is inapposite, because the accrual of interest on
compensation due under the Treaty is a question of international law.!*”°

1375 R J, para, 695; R II, paras. 964-972.

1376 Moreover, Article 2235 of the Colombian Civil Code refers to mutual or consumer loans, which have
no bearing for the present case. Furthermore, the Judgment of the Colombian State Council — which was
materially misquoted by Respondent — clarifies that Colombian law only bans compound interest if the
interest is due and accrued, but otherwise compound interest is allowed. Colombian Council of State,
Judgment of 27 March 1992, Doc. R-348, p. 9-10. In the paragraph immediately below the one quoted by
Respondent the State Council states:

“La regla tercera del articulo 1617 del C.C. [...] prohibe el cobro de intereses sobre aquéllos "atrasados",
es decir, aplicando el criterio del articulo 28 ib., lo pendiente, lo insatisfecho 0 no cumplido en su
oportunidad, vale decir, para el caso sub-lite, los intereses que no fueron cubiertos en el tiempo u
oportunidad sefialado para ello en el respectivo negocio juridico. Y, la razén de la disposicion, es el querer
del legislador de evitar que se sancione doblemente el incumplimiento contractual, lo que aconteceria si
se permitiese el cobro de intereses sobre intereses atrasados pendientes de pago.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1615. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that due and unpaid interest shall be capitalised
semi-annually, from the dies a quo.

Dies a quo

1616.Claimants request that interest be awarded since the date of payment of the Fiscal
Liability Amount. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees. Interest should start accruing from
the date of payment of the Fiscal Liability Amount, i.e. 19 January 2016, the date
when Claimants’ damage materialized, and consequently the appropriate date for
interest to start accruing.

Dies ad quem

1617. Interest shall accrue until all amounts owed in accordance with this Award have
been finally paid.

1618.In summary, the Tribunal decides that from 19 January 2016 until the date of
payment, the principal amount of USD 19.1 million shall accrue interest at rate of
LIBOR for six- month deposits plus a margin of 2% capitalised semi-annually.

IX. TAXATION

1619.Claimants submit that they are entitled to a tax indemnification. Colombia rejects
Claimants’ contention and submits that the Tribunal should deny this request.

1620. The Tribunal will advance the Parties’ positions with respect to Claimants’ claim
for tax indemnification (1.) and adopt a decision (2.).

(1) THE PARTIES’ POSITION

1621.In their request for relief, Claimants ask that the Tribunal: >”
- declare that the award of damages and interest granted to Claimants is net of all
applicable Colombian taxes;'*78

- declare that Colombia may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the
award of damages and interest;!5”

- order Colombia to indemnify Claimants in full for any Colombian taxes imposed
on the compensation awarded to the extent that such compensation has been
calculated net of Colombian taxes; '*®° and

- order Colombia to indemnify Claimants in respect of any double taxation
liability that would arise in Switzerland or elsewhere that would not have arisen
but for Colombia’s adverse measures. '**!

1622. Claimants have not made any further allegations and Respondent has submitted no
defences regarding Claimants’ tax indemnity requests.

(2) DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL
1623. Claimants make two distinct requests:

- that the Tribunal declare that the amounts awarded be net of Colombian taxes,
so that Colombia may not deduct any taxes in respect of such amount and would
have to indemnify Claimants for any Colombian taxes imposed thereon;

- that the Tribunal order Colombia to indemnify Claimants in respect of any
double taxation liability that would arise in Switzerland or elsewhere as a result
of Colombia’s Treaty breaches.

326

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1624. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants as regards the first set of claims, but not as
regards the latter.

1625.The BIT specifies that the compensation for expropriation must be “prompt,
effective and adequate”!** and “shall be settled in freely convertible currency, be
paid without delay and be freely transferable”.'**? The Tribunal has already
mentioned that although the rule refers to expropriation, it can be extended by
analogy to compensation for violations of other provisions of the BIT.'**+

1626. These rules support Claimants’ position. Colombia is a sovereign State that can tax
any assets or payments located in or originating from its territory. If Colombia were
to impose or deduct a tax on Claimants’ award, Colombia could reduce the
compensation “effectively” received by Prodeco. A reductio ad absurdum proves
the point: Colombia could practically avoid the obligation to pay Claimants the
restitution awarded by fixing a 99% tax rate on income derived from compensations
issued by international tribunals, thereby ensuring that Prodeco would only
effectively receive a restitution of 1% of the amount granted.

1627. Thus, in order to guarantee that Claimants receive full reparation for Colombia’s
international wrong, the restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco by this Tribunal
must be tax neutral. This implies that neither

- (i) the payment of the Fiscal Liability Amount by Prodeco to the Contraloria
and the State’s repayment of such amount to Prodeco, taken together, nor

- (ii) the interest awarded in this procedure must result in any tax liability to
Prodeco.

1628.Claimants also seek indemnity in respect of any double taxation of the Award that
may rise in Switzerland (or elsewhere), to the extent that such liability would not
have arisen had Colombia observed its international commitments under the Treaty.

1629.The claim is moot, because the compensation is awarded to Prodeco, not to
Glencore. Furthermore, any tax liability arising under Swiss tax laws (or any other
fiscal regime, save for that of Colombia), would not qualify as consequential loss
arising from Colombia’s breach of the Treaty and would not engage Colombia’s
liability.

1630.In conclusion, the Tribunal, in order to guarantee that Claimants receive full
reparation for Colombia’s international wrong, declares that the restitution and
interest awarded to Prodeco in accordance with this Award must be neutral with
regard to Colombian taxes (with the consequences set forth above), and orders
Respondent to indemnify Claimants with respect to any Colombian taxes in breach
of such principle.

X. COSTS

1631.Rule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules establishes that

“The award shall be in writing and shall contain [...] (j) any decision of the

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees
and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of
the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the
award.”

A. Criteria for the Decision on Costs

1641.Neither the Arbitration Rules nor the BIT contain any guidelines for the
apportionment of costs. Therefore, the Tribunal has wide discretion to decide on
how the costs of this proceeding shall be apportioned.

1642. Both Parties have requested that the other bear the costs of the proceedings °° based
on the principle that “costs follow the event”'*. Each Party additionally argues
that the counterparty needlessly complicated the proceedings and engaged in
procedural misconduct. '4°!

1643.The Tribunal will follow the principle that costs follow the event, which is the
customary principle in arbitral practice. The Tribunal will disregard the Parties’
allegations of procedural misconduct — the Mining Contract being still in force for
many years, the Tribunal does not wish unnecessarily to disrupt the future
relationship between the Republic of Colombia and Claimants.

1644. As regards the outcome of this procedure, each Party can legitimately claim that it
has succeeded in part:

- Claimants have succeeded, to the extent that three of Respondent’s four
jurisdictional objections have been dismissed and that Claimants have prevailed
in their main claim that Colombia breached the BIT and Claimants ought to be
awarded restitution;

- But Respondent has also succeeded, because the Tribunal accepted their Umbrella
Clause Objection and has dismissed Claimants’ ancillary petitions.

B. Application of the “Costs Follow the Event” Principle

1645.The Tribunal will apply the principle that costs follow the event to the two main
categories of costs: the Costs of the Proceeding and the Defense Expenses.

a. Costs of the Proceeding
1646. Claimants claim the Costs of the Proceedings paid to ICSID, i.e. the advances made

by Claimants to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative fees
of ICSID.

330

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1647.The Tribunal finds that these costs should be assumed by Respondent, given that
Claimants have prevailed in the majority of the jurisdictional objections and the
Tribunal has found a breach by Colombia of the BIT.

1648.Thus, Colombia must reimburse Claimants the totality of the Costs of the
Proceeding made to ICSID (net of any final reimbursements made by ICSID).

b. Defense Expenses

1649.As a first step, the Tribunal must establish the amount of reasonable defense
expenses which a standard claimant has to incur, in order properly to present and
defend its claim [“Reasonable Defense Expenses”]. Taking into consideration the
complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and the work of legal counsel and
experts, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants’ Reasonable Defense
Expenses amount to USD 3.3 million.

1650.Colombia must only assume that part of the Claimants’ Reasonable Defense
Expenses that results from applying the principle that cost follow the event. To
determine such amount, the Tribunal must:
- First, determine the main legal issues that have been decided;

- Second, give each legal issue a ponderation; and

- Third, determine the success rate of Claimants’ claims in each legal issue and
apply it to Claimants’ Reasonable Defense Expenses.

1651.In this arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal has had to make three significant decisions:
- whether the Disputed Documents ought to be admitted into the record in
Respondent’s Counter-memorial on the Merits and through document
production,
- whether it had jurisdiction,
- whether Colombia had violated the Treaty and the consequences thereof.
1652. The Parties declare to have dedicated approximately 60% of their costs to the merits
of the case, approximately 30% to jurisdiction and approximately to 10% to
document production. Thus, the Tribunal will assign each of the legal issues the

weight given by the Parties.

1653.As a consequence, Claimants’ Reasonable Defense Expenses must be divided as
follows:

- Jurisdiction: 30% of USD 3.3 million amounts to USD 990,000;
- Merits: 60% of USD 3.3 million amounts to USD 1,980,000;

- Document Production: 10% of USD 3.3 million amounts to USD 330,000.

331

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

1654. The Tribunal must now determine Claimants’ rate of success in each legal issue:

- Jurisdiction: Since Claimants were successful in %4 of the jurisdictional
objections, their success rate was 75%.

- Merits: Claimants were successful in two (partially on letters a) and f) of their
request for relief) out of the six main claims requested; they were successful in
33% of their claims.

- Document Production: Claimants succeeded in their general petition that the
Disputed Documents be excluded in PO No. 2, where the Tribunal found that
the “proper procedure to obtain evidence from the counterparty is through the
agreed document production exercise”!#"?; in the Revised Document Production
exercise both parties made use of their right to request documents: Claimants
submitted a total of seven requests, while Respondent presented 39; in PO No.
3 the Tribunal denied 11 and reduced the scope of 19 of the 22 requests granted
to Colombia; the Tribunal granted all of Claimants’ requests; the Tribunal
subsequently ruled in PO No. 4 that Claimants’ invocation of privilege for all of
the Disputed Documents was admissible and settlement privilege over certain of
the Disputed Documents was properly asserted; in summary, the Tribunal
considers that Claimants’ success rate as regard Document Production was of
90%.

1655.The Tribunal will now apply the success rate to Claimants’ Reasonable Defense
Expenses for each legal issue:

- Jurisdiction: 75% of USD 990,000, which amounts to USD 742,500;
- Merits: 33% of USD 1,980,000, which amounts to USD 653,400;

- Document Production: 90% of USD 330,000, which amounts to
USD 297,000.

(4) INTEREST

1656. The Parties have requested that interest be awarded over the amounts awarded as
costs.'#°3 And the Tribunal agrees.

1657.The Tribunal has already decided that the restitution awarded to Claimants shall
accrue interest at a LIBOR rate for six months deposits denominated in USD plus a
2% surcharge compounded semi-annually.

1658.The same shall be applied to the amounts that Respondent is ordered to reimburse
as costs.

1402 PQ No. 2, para. 70.
1403 TV, para. 44(a); R II, para. 31 (The Tribunal notes that Respondent considers that LIBOR +2% is a
commercially reasonable interest rate).

1660. The dies ad quem shall be the date of effective payment.

1661.In summary, Colombia must reimburse Claimants (i) the Costs of the Proceedings
(net of any final reimbursements by ICSID) and (ii) USD 1,692,900 as Defense
Expenses, plus (iii) interest on both amounts at a rate of LIBOR for six-month
deposits with a margin of 2% capitalised semi-annually from the date of this award
until the date of payment.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

XI. SUMMARY

1662.In this section, the Tribunal will review Claimants’ and Respondent’s requests for
relief (which have been set-forth in detail in Section ITV supra, and compare such
requests with the Tribunal’s findings.

(1) CLAIMANTS’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
1663. Claimants have made nine requests for relief, identified as (a) through (n).

A. Request (a)

(a) DECLARE that Colombia has breached Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 10(2) of
the Treaty.

1664. The Tribunal has found that Colombia breached Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty,
and that the improper measure consisted in the Contraloria applying an
unreasonable methodology to establish the damages allegedly caused to Colombia
by the Eighth Amendment.

B. Request (b)

(b) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM or any other government agency
that may in due course become the contractual counterparty of Prodeco under
the Mining Contract, continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment
and further that all organs of the Colombian state take any and all actions
necessary to ensure and not interfere with such continued performance and
observance.

1665.In this Request Claimants ask the Tribunal to order Colombia that it continue to
perform and observe the Eighth Amendment.

1666.The Parties have discussed whether, from a theoretical point of view, an
international arbitration tribunal constituted under the Treaty and the ICSID
Convention is authorized to issue an order of this type to a sovereign State like
Colombia.'*

1667. The theoretical question may remain unanswered, because in the present case, there
is no cause-effect relationship between the Tribunal’s findings (that the Contraloria
wrongly calculated the damage caused to the Republic by the Eighth Amendment)
and Claimants’ request that Colombia be ordered to continue to perform the Eighth
Amendment. Reparation of the international wrong committed by Colombia
requires full reparation, and full reparation is achieved by restitution plus interest
of the amounts improperly demanded and paid — not by ordering Colombia to
perform the Eighth Amendment.

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

 

C. Requests (c) and (e)

(c) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, procure the immediate and
unconditional cessation of the ANM Proceedings with prejudice.

(e) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, give appropriate assurances
and guarantees that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in
relation to the Eighth Amendment.

1668.Claimants’ Requests (c) and (e) cannot succeed, because the Tribunal has found
that a breach of the Treaty did not arise when the SGC/ANM filed with the
competent Colombian court a claim for the annulment of the Eighth Amendment.
Since the tribunal contencioso-administrativo has not yet made any decision on the
SGC/ANM’s request for annulment, Claimants cannot and in fact do not make a
claim for breach of the FET standard in the form of denial of justice. Any
hypothetical future claim for denial of justice would have to be adjudicated in a new
proceeding.

1669. Furthermore, Request (e) is drafted in terms which are too broad: the Tribunal’s
findings do not support a blanket order to Colombia not to initiate new proceedings
of any kind in relation to the Eighth Amendment. If, for example, Prodeco breaches
the Eighth Amendment, there is no reason why the Mining Agency should be
prohibited to start appropriate proceedings.

D. Request (d)

(d) ORDER that Colombia provide appropriate assurances and guarantees
from the [Contraloria] that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings
in relation to the Eighth Amendment.

1670.The Tribunal has found that the Contraloria’s methodology for calculating the
damage suffered by Colombia was unreasonable and in breach of Arts. 4(1) and
4(2) of the Treaty.

1671.The Tribunal has provided a number of reasons which justify its findings of
unreasonableness: 45

- The methodology of the Tover-Silva Report, based on a simple analysis of the
Transition Period, is flawed;

- The methodology to be used by the Contraloria must be forward looking and be
based on simulations as of the date of the Eighth Amendment;

- That methodology must take into account the fact that under the 2010 PTI
Prodeco assumed an obligation to increase investment and to expand the Mine,
resulting in an increased production of coal.

1405 For details see Section VI.3.(2.2).B.c supra.

335

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

1672.Should the Contraloria decide to initiate new proceedings against Prodeco in
relation to the Eighth Amendment, it will be bound to respect these findings —
otherwise the new calculation of damages will be unreasonable for the same reasons
and Colombia will again incur in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.

1673.In the operative part of this Award, the Tribunal will declare that the Contraloria’s
conduct in calculating the damage suffered by the Republic was in breach of Arts.
4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. Not only does the Tribunal’s decision legally obligate
Colombia to repair the harm caused as a consequence of the wrongful conduct in
the past; it also implies that the Contraloria (and Colombia) are required by the
Treaty to abstain from incurring in the same wrongful conduct in the future. The
Tribunal considers that, in the circumstances of this case, the specific assurances or
guarantees by the Republic that Claimants request in their Request (d) are

unnecessary.
E. Request (f)

(f) ORDER that, by way of restitution, Colombia repay to Prodeco the Fiscal
Liability Amount of US$19.1 million” paid by Prodeco to Colombia on 19
January 2016 in the context of the Fiscal Liability Proceedings, and any sums
that the GCO or any other organ of the Colombian State or Colombian court
may, up to the date of the Tribunal’s Award, have ordered Prodeco to pay by
way of royalties or GIC calculated on the purported basis that the Eighth
Amendment should not apply, adjusted from the date of payment to the date
of the Award at an annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually;

1674. As regards this Request, the Tribunal will find in favour of Claimants, and will
order Colombia to repay to Prodeco, by way of restitution, USD 19.1 million, i.e.
the totality of the Fiscal Liability Amount, denominated in USD, plus interest as set
forth in Section VIII.

F. Requests (g), (h) and (i)

(g) ORDER that if Colombia does not comply with orders requested in (b),
(c), (d), (e), and (f) above within 90 days of the date of the Award, Colombia:

(A) pay Claimants the Fiscal Liability Amount of US$19.1 million plus
interest to the date of the Award;

(B) pay Claimants forward-looking damages as of the date of the Award
computed as the difference in expected net revenues between a
scenario with and without the royalty and GIC provisions in the
Eighth Amendment between the date of Award and the end of the
Calenturitas mine life as assessed by Claimants’ experts at US$336.1
million as of 31 December 2017; and

(C) fully indemnify and hold harmless Claimants in respect of all
retroactive royalty and GIC amounts that Claimants are ordered to pay

406 © I], fn. 991: “Te 63 billion Colombian Pesos converted into US Dollars at the 19 January 2016 date of
payment. See Compass Lexecon I, para. 96; Compass Lexecon II, para. 92”.

336

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

in relation to the years 2011 to the date of the Award as a consequence
of a failure to apply the Eighth Amendment, assessed at US$238.6
million as of 31 December 2017.

(h) In order to avoid double recovery, in the event that subsection (g) is
triggered, and solely upon Colombia’s payment and Claimants’ effective
receipt of all of the compensation set out in (g)(A) and g(B) above (duly
updated to the date of the Award), and in light of the indemnification ordered
in g(C) above, ORDER Claimants to pay royalties and GIC from the date of
the Award onwards based on the regime that existed prior to the Eighth
Amendment.

(i) ORDER Colombia to pay post-award interest on (f), or, alternatively, (g)
above, at a rate of 9.69%'*°’ per annum from the date of the Award,
compounded semi-annually, or at such other rate and compounding period as
the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation.

1675.Requests (g), (h) and (i) assume that Colombia has failed to respect Requests (b),
(c), (d) or (e). Since the Tribunal has already dismissed Requests (b), (c), (d) and
(e), the necessary consequence is that Requests (g), (h) and (i) have become moot.

G.

Requests (j) and (k)
(j) DECLARE that:

(i) The award of damages and interest in (f), (g) and (h) is made net of
applicable Colombian taxes; and

(ii) Colombia may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award
of damages and interest in (f), (g) or (h);

(k) ORDER Colombia to indemnify the Claimants in full with respect to
any Colombian taxes imposed on the compensation awarded to the
extent that such compensation has been calculated net of Colombian
taxes;

1676.The Tribunal has found that the restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco in
accordance with this Award must be neutral with regard to Colombian taxes and
has ordered Respondent to indemnify Claimants with respect to any Colombian
taxes in breach of such principle.

H.

Request (1)

(J) ORDER Colombia to indemnify Claimants in respect of any double
taxation liability that would arise in Switzerland or elsewhere that would not
have arisen but for Colombia’s adverse measures;

1677.This Request (1) is inapposite: the Tribunal is ordering that Colombia repay the
Fiscal Liability Award to Prodeco, not to Glencore. Claimants have failed to prove

1407

This figure was updated in Claimants’ Reply Memorial, C II, para. 374(i).

337

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

that restitution to Prodeco will result in any double taxation liability in Switzerland
or elsewhere.

I. Request (m)

(m) ORDER Colombia to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration,
including Claimants’ legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any
experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and
ICSID’s costs.

1678.The Tribunal has ordered that Colombia reimburse Claimants the amount of
USD 625,000 (net of reimbursement by ICSID) as Costs of the Proceeding and
USD 1,692,900 as Defense Expenses.

(2) RESPONDENT’S REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

1679.Respondent submits requests for relief on jurisdiction and admissibility and on the
merits.

A. Requests on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

1004. To declare:

That it lacks jurisdiction over all of Claimants’ claims; and

That all of Claimants’ claims are, in any event, inadmissible;

That Claimants’ claims newly raised in the Reply are untimely and
hence inadmissible

1680. The Tribunal has dismissed Respondent’s
-  Tllegality Objection,
- Fork in the Road Objection, and
- Inadmissibility Objection,
but has accepted Respondent’s Umbrella Clause Objection.

1681.The necessary consequence is that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal is
competent to adjudicate claims grounded on breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the
Treaty.

1682. The Tribunal has also dismissed Respondent’s additional request that certain claims

allegedly raised for the first time in the Reply be declared untimely and
inadmissible.

338

Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia
(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

B. Merits

1006. If, par impossible, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction on
Claimants’ claims and that such claims are admissible, to declare:

e That Colombia complied with its international obligations under the
Treaty and international law;

¢ That Colombia did not breach Article 4(1) of the Treaty and that all
Claimants’ claims grounded therein are therefore dismissed;

¢ That Colombia did not breach Article 4(2) of the Treaty and that all
Claimants’ claims grounded therein are therefore dismissed;

¢ That Colombia did not breach Article 10(2) of the Treaty and that all
Claimants’ claims grounded therein are therefore dismissed; and

1683.The Tribunal has already set forth its findings: Respondent has indeed breached
Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty, and consequently, the Tribunal has ordered that
Claimants are compensated with the restitution of the amounts improperly paid,
plus interest. As regards the breach of Art. 10(2), the Tribunal accepted
Respondent’s Umbrella Clause Objection, and consequently declared that it lacks

competence (and the Centre jurisdiction) to adjudicate that claim.

C. Quantum

1008. If, par impossible, the Tribunal finds that Colombia has breached its
international obligations under the Treaty and/or international law, to declare:

e That Claimants’ non-monetary claims are beyond the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction and powers, or are inadmissible;

That Claimants have not suffered any damages warranting
compensation; and

That, in any event, Claimants materially contributed to their alleged
losses, and that any amounts the Tribunal may award to Claimants are
to be reduced accordingly by, at least, 75%.

1684. As regards quantum, the Tribunal has found that Claimants have suffered harm as
caused by Colombia’s wrongful acts and has ordered full reparation in the form of
restitution of the Fiscal Liability Amount - the sum which Prodeco had wrongly

paid to the Contraloria, plus interest.

1685. The Tribunal has not accepted any of Claimants’ non-monetary claims (except for

the declaration of breach), for the reasons set forth in this section.

1686.Finally, the Tribunal has dismissed Respondent’s argument that Claimants

materially contributed to their own losses.

339

1687. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously

(ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6)

XII. DECISION

1498 rules as follows:

Dismisses Respondent’s Illegality Objection, Fork in the Road Objection, and
Inadmissibility Objection, upholds Respondent’s Umbrella Clause Objection,
and declares that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal is competent to
adjudicate claims grounded on breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.

Declares that that the Contraloria’s conduct in calculating the damage
allegedly suffered by the Republic of Colombia as a result of the execution of
the Eighth Amendment constitutes (i) an unreasonable measure which has
impaired Claimants’ investment in Colombia in breach of Art. 4(1) of the
Treaty and (ii) a breach of fair and equitable treatment, in violation of Art.
4(2) of the Treaty.

Orders the Republic of Colombia to restitute to C.I. Prodeco S.A. the Fiscal
Liability Amount in the sum of USD 19,100,000.

Orders the Republic of Colombia to pay interest over the amount established
in para. 3 from 19 January 2016 until the date of actual payment, at the rate
of LIBOR for six-month deposits plus a margin of 2%, capitalised semi-
annually.

Declares that the payment of restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco in
accordance with this Award must be neutral as regards Colombian taxes, with
the consequences set forth in para. 1630 of this Award, and orders the
Republic of Colombia to indemnify Prodeco with respect to any Colombian
taxes in breach of such principle.

Orders the Republic of Colombia to reimburse Claimants (i) the Costs of the
Proceedings (net of any final reimbursements by ICSID) and (ii) USD
1,692,900 as Defense Expenses, plus interest on both amounts at a rate of
LIBOR for six-month deposits with a margin of 2%, capitalised semi-
annually from the date of this award until the date of actual payment.

Dismisses all other claims, objections and defences.
