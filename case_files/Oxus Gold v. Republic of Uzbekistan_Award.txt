IL. General Overview of the Background of the Dispute

Oxus Gold commenced its operations in Uzbekistan in 1997. Its mining activities
in Uzbekistan were carried out by and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
ORC and Marakand (Claim. AoJ. 12.05.2012, para. 10; see also above para. 6 and
8). Oxus Gold pursued two distinct business operations in Uzbekistan: the so-
called “AGF Project” and the “Khandiza Project”.

The present dispute, while between the same parties, concerns thus two different
projects, i.e. the “Khandiza Project” and the “AGF Project”. Notwithstanding the
fact that the Arbitral Tribunal will therefore proceed with the examination of these
two projects on a separate basis, it is nevertheless useful to firstly lay out the
general origin of Claimant’s involvement in these projects.

The Khandiza Project concerned the exploration of one of Uzbekistan’s mineral
deposits situated in the Surkhandaria region in south-east Uzbekistan, i.e.
Khandiza. This deposit is a classic volcanogenic sulphide deposit containing
sizeable copper, lead, gold, silver and zinc deposits. (Claim. 31.08.2011, para.
26).

The AGF Project refers to the management and operation of AGF which was in
charge of the exploitation of the Amantaytau goldfields. These goldfields are one
of the world’s largest gold endowment and the largest gold production site in
Uzbekistan, consisting of 192 km’ in the Kyzylkum region in the Tien Shan belt.
They include the deposits of (i) Amantaytau Centralny, (ii) Amantaytau Severny,
(iii) Uzunbulak, and (iv) Vyskokovoltnoye (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 241).

32.

The Origin of Claimant's Involvement in the Khandiza Project

It is undisputed that the Khandiza Deposit was discovered by Samarkand Geology
and that diamond drilling had already been carried out between 1958 and 1975
during the Soviet era (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 115; Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 47), although the Parties disagree on the scope and quality of
these works performed prior to 1975.

The results of these works are summarized in various reports (hereinafter “Soviet
studies”), including:

Report on the Polymetallic Deposit at Khandiza of 1 April 1970 (“Deposit
Report 1970”) (Exh. R-253);

Feasibility Study of 1974 (“Feasibility Study 1974”) (Exh. R-255);

Report on Results of Detailed Exploration of Khandiza Complex Ore Deposit
for 1973-1974 (“Deposit Report 1973-1974”) (Exh. R-786);

Samarkand Geology’s Feasibility Study of 1983 (“Feasibility Study 1983”)
(Exh. R-256);

It is further undisputed that during the Soviet era, i.e., from 1975 to 1996, no
further works were performed and the Khandiza Deposit was left undeveloped
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 122; Shayakubov, Transcripts of 30 April
2014, 596:18-19). It is only after the independence of Uzbekistan, that the Uzbek
Government decided to start developing this Deposit through the help of foreign
investment. The Parties however disagree on the reasons for this delay in
developing the Khandiza Deposit.

In_1996, first contacts took place between Uzbekistan and ORC. The specific
circumstances of these first contacts are disputed between the Parties, while it is
undisputed that they happened in the context of a Mining Conference held in
Denver in the summer of 1996 (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 134; Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 50 fol.). Thereafter, ORC sent a geologist, Mr.
Charter, to Uzbekistan to review Goskomgeology’s data regarding the Khandiza
Deposit and visit the Khandiza Deposit (Exh. C-146; Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 54, Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 65).

On 15 August 1996, Goskomgeology and ORC entered into a “Protocol of
Intentions” regarding Khandiza (Exh. C-147). Under this Protocol,
Goskomgeology agreed to share with ORC all available information on Khandiza,
including the results of all previous Soviet studies. For its part, ORC agreed to

38

33.

34.

35.

36.

37.

complete a Pre-Feasibility Study and to prepare a programme of further works by
October 1, 1996 (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 141; Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 55).

On 1 October 1996, Mr. Charter, the geologist of ORC sent on site to review the
data of the Khandiza Deposit (see above para. 31) and also the Vice-President and
Director of ORC, submitted to Goskomgeology a “Preliminary Review of the
Khandiza Massive Sulphide Deposit, SE Uzbekistan” (hereinafter “Khandiza
Preliminary Review”) (Exh. C-148). This review suggested that ORC proceed
with a more detailed assessment of the Khandiza Deposit by way of a Pre-
Feasibility Study (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 143).

On 2 October 1996, ORC submitted a “Proposal by Oxus Mining Corporation to
State Committee on Geology of Uzbek Republic for Phase I of a Feasibility Study
on the Khandiza Massive Sulphide Deposit” (hereinafter “Khandiza Phase 1
Feasibility Study Proposal” or “WGM Proposal”) issued by WGM. This Proposal
laid down a programme of further works for the successful development of the
Khandiza mine (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 145).

On _14 December 1996, ORC and Goskomgeology entered into a “Primary
Exploration Agreement” (hereinafter “PEA”) (Exh. C-40) in relation to the
development of the Khandiza Deposit and a 12,000 km? area surrounding it and
expanding to the north of the Deposit. The PEA’s declared purpose was to
develop the initial framework of a Feasibility Study for the Khandiza Deposit and
geological additional study in the surrounding area and to carry out exploration
works.

This Agreement was eventually assigned to Marakand (see Decision on
Jurisdiction, paras. 19 fol.) and constitutes the factual basis for Claimant’s claims
in the present arbitration. It is examined more in detail below (para. 140).

The Origin and Evolution of Claimant’s Ownership in the AGF Project

2.1 AGF Joint Venture’s Operations prior to Claimant’s Participation
therein

On 24 November 1993, AGF was established through a Joint Venture Agreement
(hereinafter “AGF Original JV Agreement”) (Exh. C-281).

39

38.

39.

On 20 April 1994, Uzbekistan issued Presidential Decree No. DP-837 ‘On
Measures to Ensure the Currency Control of Export and Import Operations’
(hereinafter “Decree No. DP-837”) (Exh. R-38) providing in Article 1 as follows:

“Quotas for export of goods (works, services) shall not be sold, transferred,
or redistributed to other legal entities;

 

Settle s of the ext import of ions of the ipanies, or

and institutions of the Republic of Uzbekistan with foreign partners through
the accounts of the companies in foreign banks shall be prohibited and
punishable by law.”

On 22 September 1994, CabMin issued Decree No. 477 ‘On the Formation of
the AGF Joint Venture and on Matters Ensuring its Effective Functioning’
(hereinafter “Decree No. 477”) (Exh. C-215) in which it granted the AGF Joint
Venture certain rights regarding the exploration and development of the
Amantaytau goldfields, as well as certain benefits regarding accounting and
taxation regimes (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 254). At the same time, Prime
Minister Sultanov, together with its Deputy Prime Ministers, were designated as
responsible for monitoring AGF’s implementation of the Project and its
compliance with the investment obligations set forth in those Decrees! (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 209).

Relevant provisions of Decree No. 477 are reproduced hereinbelow:

’On the creation of the Joint Venture “Amantaytau Goldfields” and
measures to ensure its effective functioning’

In order to increase the production of precious metals by attracting modern
technology and investments from abroad, the Cabinet of Ministers decrees:

LJ

4. To grant the Joint Venture “Amantaytau Goldfields” the following

conditions as defined in the Agreement for the period of 30
years;

- to sell for freely convertible currency and at world prices gold,
silver and other products obtained from mining the Goldfields
abroad as well as in the Republic of Uzbekistan;

' It appears that while Claimant has largely referred to the term “Resolution” and Respondent
to the term “Decree”, the Tribunal will use the term “Decree” in this Award, whereby such
designation shall not be interpreted as having any particular legal consequence.

40

to open accounts in accordance with the established procedure
in any currency with the banks of the Republic of Uzbekistan
and foreign banks, and to receive and use foreign currency
from such foreing accounts;

Clause 7 of Decree No. 477 is hereafter referred to as the “Tax Stabilization
Clause”.

On 12 December 1994, the AGF Joint Venture was established by signing of the
‘Charter by the Closed Joint Stock Company Amantaytau Goldfields A.O’
(hereinafter the “Original AGF Charter”) by Goskomgeology, NMMK, Lonrho
and the IFC. Goskomgeology and NMMK jointly held approximately 57%,
Lonrho held approximately 35% and IFC held approximately 8% (Exh. C-216).

In_1995, AGF obtained an exploration license (hereinafter “Exploration
License”), which granted AGF exploration rights for the entire 192 km?
Amantaytau project territory (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 361). This license
was valid for a period of ten (10) years.

On 30 March 1996, CabMin issued Decree No. 127-20 ‘On Additional Measures
to Ensure the Effective Functioning of the AGF Joint Venture’ (hereinafter
“Decree No. 127-20”) (Exh. C-218), which exempted AGF from certain taxes,
including from VAT on materials and equipments, works and services of
contracting and/or subcontracting organizations involved in construction before
the commissioning of the Project’s Phase 2 operations (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 255; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 117). In this regard, the Decree
provided as follows:

42

43.

44.

“7. Resolve that the privileges, envisaged by the Decree [...] No. 477 and
this Decree:

e Apply to foreign companies, conducting construction activities for

Uzbekistan evaluate and submit for approval to the Cabinet of
Ministers The Regulations on taxation regime, accounting system and
reporting for the Joint \venture ‘Arnantaytau Goldfields’;

e Approve the order of compensating the difference in cost of power for
the JV ‘Arnantaytau Goldfields’.””

2.2 Claimant’s Acquisition of Shares in AGF Joint Venture

In May 1997, Lonrho announced that it was seeking to withdraw from the AGF
Project and Respondent was apparently seeking to replace Lonrho with another
foreign partner (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 242).

On 30 April 1998, Uzbekistan issued Law No. 609-1 ‘On Foreign Investment’
(hereinafter “Law on Foreign Investment”) (Exhs. R-276/277) aimed to “define a
legal basis and the procedure for execution of foreign investments on the territory
of the Republic of Uzbekistan” and which described its basic tasks as follows:

“The basic tasks of the present Law are the following:

 

= economy | ion in the Republic ofUzbekistan and its i
into world economic system by stimulation of flow of foreign
investments;

- an attraction and efficient use of foreign financial, material,
intellectual and other resources, modern foreign technologies and
managerial experience.”

In Article 3, the Law on Foreign Investment defined the terms “foreign
investments” as follows (Exh. R-277):

“Article 3. Foreign investments

43

Article 3. Guarantees of foreign investors' rights

applied to foreign investments within ten years of the date of investment. The
foreign investor has the right at his own discretion to apply those provisions
of a new legislation which make better conditions of his investment.
Worsening conditions of investments refer to changes and amendments to
the legislation current on the date of investment or adoption of the new legal
acts, providing:

- increase in the rate of tax on incomes, received as dividends, paid to the
foreign investor; [.

 

In Articles 10 and 11, the Law on Foreign Investment then sets out various
rights and obligations of the investors as follows:

“Article 10. Foreign investors' rights

In accordance with the principles of international law and the legislation of
the Republic of Uzbekistan, the foreign investor has the right for the
following:

- to define on his own account the amount, kinds and channels of

on the right of ownership, on which a claim can be made in accordance with the
legislative acts of the Republic of Uzbekistan.”

In February 1999, in view of its intended involvement in the AGF Joint Venture,
ORC prepared and submitted a Preliminary Feasibility Study called ‘Amantaytau
Daugystau Project/Proposed Development Programme’ (Exhs. C-209/C-596),
which contemplated a two-phase development of the Amantaytau site: Phase |
would involve development of oxide deposits of Amantaytau Centralny,
Uzunbulak and Vyskokovoltnoye in extracting gold by open-pit mine and heal-
leach processing (hereinafter “Open-Pit Project”), and Phase 2 would consist
mainly in exploiting the underground mine to harness sulphide deposits found in
Amantaytau Centralny and Amantayatu Severny (hereinafter “Underground
Project”) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 243). In this Programme, ORC declared
that “[i]t is assumed that the initial oxide phase will be funded 100% by Oxus/IFC
shareholder loans, with no debt finance required from banks” and that “it is
assumed that 25 percent of available cashflow will be distributed to the Parties as
dividends” (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 119, Exh. C-209).

On 10 June 1999, Goskomgeology, NMMC and ORC signed a letter of intent,
recording the former two’s support for ORC to enter the AGF Project in
replacement of Lonrho (Exh. C-210).

On 31 August 1999, IFC entered into an “Assignment and Release Agreement”
with Lonrho assigning its 8% shares in AGF to Lonrho (by then renamed
‘Lonmin’) (Exh. C-37).

On 31 August 1999, ORC concluded with Lonmin an “Agreement for the Sale
and Purchase of an Equity Interest in Amantaytau Goldfieds A.O.” (Exh. C-37)
by which it acquired Lonmin’s 43% shareholding in the AGF JV against USD 4,3
million consideration, comprising a USD 3 million special warrant to acquire
shares in ORC and USD 1,3 million in convertible debentures, which could be
converted into either special warrants or ordinary shares (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 247). The IFC had previously already transferred its 8% shares to Lonmin,
as mentioned in para. 47 above. (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 120).

On 1 October 1999, CabMin issued Decree No. 425-108, approving ORC’s shares
and rights in AGF (Exh. C-211).

On 3 May 2000, a letter was sent from Central Bank to AGF regarding the use of

On 25 May 2000, Uzbekistan issued a new law, Law No. 71-II ‘On Licensing of
Certain Types of Activities’ (Exh. R-144) setting out the conditions for applying
and obtaining licenses, including also terms for refusal, suspension or renewal of
licenses.

On 10 July 2000, Goskomgeology, NMMC and ORC signed the “Charter of the
Closed Joint Stock Company Amantaytau Goldfields A. O.” (hereinafter
“Revised AGF Charter (1)”) (Exh. C-212). Clause 2.2 of the AGF Charter
described AGF’s activities as follows:

“SECTION 2.2. Subject of the Company's Activities.

On 11 July 2000, CabMin issued Decree No. 266 ‘On Additional Measures to
Organize the Operation of the AGF JV’ (hereinafter “Decree No. 266”) (Exhs.
C-213/R-573), pursuant to which it took note of ORC’s right of participation in
the AGF joint venture as foreign investor and agreed to increase ORC’s
shareholding by another 7% to 50% in exchange for an additional USD 813,955
contribution to the company’s charter fund. In addition, CabMin confirmed
certain tax privileges previously granted to AGF and renewed the tax stabilization
clause granted under Clause 7 of Decree No. 477 (see above para. 39) for a period
of 10 years, ie. until 11 July 2010 (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 256; Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 120; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 72). Under this
Decree, CabMin directed the Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics to
include AGF in the targeted part of its investment program, and reaffirmed Prime
Minister Sultanov’s responsibility to monitor the implementation of Decree No.
266. (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 209). For this purpose, AGF was
required to “provide information on the project progress to the Cabinet of
Ministers every month.” (Exh. R-400).

The relevant parts of the Decree No. 266 are reproduced below:

“4. The proposal of the founders of the joint venture "Amantaytau
Goldfields" to implement the project step-by-step shall be accepted.

It shall be noted that:

the capital costs at the first stage represent 53.1 million US dollars and
be made by Oxus Resources Corporation in the form of direct
investments from its own and attracted funds;

48

the value, sources of financing and conditions of implementation of the
second stage will be defined in 2001 on the basis of the project's
financial and economic parameters.

5. The Ministry for Macroeconomics and Statistics of the Republic of
Uzbekistan shall include this project in the targeted part of the
Investment Program of the Republic of Uzbekistan, namely, in a section
of the projects financed though direct foreign investments, with a
development forecast in 2000 for the amount totalling 5 million US
dollars.

6. All the rights, privileges, conditions of taxation and guarantees that
have been granted to the project's participants by the decrees of the
Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan, which were adopted
earlier, shall be reserved.

7. It shall be established that:

Clause 7 of Decree No. 477 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Republic of
Uzbekistan, dated 22 September 1994, came into effect as of the date of
this Decree;

a tax for the use of subsoil will be collected from the JV “Amantaytau
Goldfields” in the amount established by current legislation, i.e. 2.8 per
cent of the amount of the proceeds gained by the joint venture from
selling the extracted precious metals and other associated products.

8. The State Committee for Geology of the Republic of Uzbekistan shall
issue to the JV “Amantaytau Goldfields”, in a prescribed manner, a
licence for the subsoil use granting the rights to carry out the
exploration works and mining operations within the project area.

54. On 19 July 2000, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus Gold (then Oxus Mining)
responded to the Central Bank’s letter of 3 May 2000 (see above para. 50) by
sending back the letter to the Central Bank and stating as follows (Exh. C-630):

“Dear Mr. Rakhimov

I refer to your letter of 3 May 2000 [...]. As you know a Decree of the
Cabinet of Ministers has recently been issued which further highlights the
Government’s commitment to the success of the AGF project. It also
specifically preserves all the rights and privileges previously granted to
AGF in earlier decrees. In the light of this, I am returning the original of
your letter to you. In any event it does not address the issue raised in our
letter of 5 April.

As Iam sure you will understand, if your letter was allowed to remain in our
files, we would be unable to finance the AGF project. Lawyers acting on
behalf of the London Stock Exchange and various international lending
banks will shortly be carrying out legal due diligence on the AGF project.

49

55.

56.

Even if there have been changes in Uzbek legislation, it is important that the
rights of foreign investors are protected and that privileges previously
granted cannot be unilaterally withdrawn. [...]

Accordingly we intend to continue operating AGF in accordance with the
Joint Venture [...], the Charter [...], and [Decrees No. 477, 127-20, 452-
108, 266]. We also note the privileges and guarantees afforded to us
pursuant to the Law on Foreign Investments [...], the Law on Guarantees
and Measures to Protect the Rights of Foreign Investors [...] and the
inclusion of AGF into the Republican Foreign Investment Programme
pursuant to [Decree No. 550].

It is of fundamental importance to Oxus, as the foreign investor, and to any
international lending banks, that proceeds from gold sales can be paid into
the AGF offshore account, as already agreed with the Government. It is on
this basis that Oxus chose to invest in the project and purchase Lonrho’s
43% shareholding. [...]”

During the Hearing, Mr. Wilkins gave the following testimony concerning this
letter (see Transcripts of 29 April 2014, 305:13 - 306:3):

“ And what happened in 2000, Colm Hussey, the AGF accountant, wrote a
letter, which I didn't know about, to the Central Bank requesting
clarification on something, frankly, very immaterial. I don't even remember
what it was.

To my horror, the Central Bank replied with a letter that canceled--
effectively canceled our rights to the offshore bank account. I mean, this
was immediately prior to us about to go to the London Stock Exchange to
raise money. This was outrageous. It took me completely by surprise. As
you saw yesterday, my reaction was to return the letter to the Central Bank,
the original signed version, with a letter from me basically saying, You can't
do this, you're in breach of the foreign investment law. This is a material
adverse change, and this could--this would wreck us. We wouldn't be able to

finance the company. Having returned it, I heard nothing since.”

On 24 July 2000, Goskomgeology, NMMC and ORC adopted a revised version of
the AGF Charter (hereinafter “Revised AGF Charter (2)”) (Exh. C-446) (see
above para. 52) to account for the increased shareholding of ORC in AGF as
approved by Decree No. 266 (see above para. 53).

On 28 July 2000, AGF held one of the first General Shareholders Meeting
including ORC as shareholder (Exh. R-400). At this Meeting, the shareholders
discussed among other matters the issue of “the situation with bankable feasibility
study (FS) of AGF for the Stage I and proposed work program for completion of
the FS and debt financing”, during which Mr. Turner reported on the status of

50

63.

progress and the requirement for obtaining appropriate financing for completing
the works in accordance with the schedule (see further below para. 407)

On 3 July 2001, Oxus Gold (then Oxus Mining) acquired all of ORC’s share
capital, thus becoming the parent company of ORC (Exh. C-38, p. 28 “Basis of
consolidation’).

On _ 25 June 2004, Oxus Gold transferred its shareholding in ORC to Oxus
Holdings (Malta) Limited (Exh. C-39). As of that date, Oxus Gold holds 50% of
the AGF through the intermediary of Oxus Holdings (Malta) Limited and its
daughter company ORC.

Il. The Arbitral Proceedings

As indicated above, the Arbitral Tribunal has already issued a Decision on
Jurisdiction laying out the procedural steps completed until then. Thus, the present
description of the arbitral proceeding has been simplified with regard to steps
completed prior to the Decision on Jurisdiction and focuses on procedural steps
completed thereafter.

The Initiation of the Procedure

On 31 August 2011, Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration (hereinafter “Claim.
NoA. 31.08.2011”) against (1) the Republic of Uzbekistan, (2) the State
Committee of Uzbekistan for Geology & Mineral Resources, and (3) Navoi
Mining & Metallurgical Kombinat, whereby it appointed the Hon. Marc Lalonde
as arbitrator.

On_5_and_28 March 2012, respectively, Claimant officially confirmed the
withdrawal of its direct claims against the State Committee of Uzbekistan for
Geology and Mineral Resources, and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgic
Kombinat and submitted an ‘Amended Notice of Arbitration’ to reflect the
withdrawal of those claims.

On _30 September _2011, Respondent filed its Response to the Notice of
Arbitration (hereinafter “Resp. RNoA. 30.09.2011”), whereby it appointed

Professor Brigitte Stern as arbitrator.

On 13 December 2011, the two party-designated arbitrators appointed Professor
Pierre Tercier as chairman and on 20 December 2011 they informed the Parties of

71.

Professor Tercier’s acceptance to chair the Arbitral Tribunal and confirmed his
nomination. Thus, on 20 December 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal was officially
constituted in accordance with Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On 8 February 2012, a Preliminary Meeting took place in Geneva, during which
the Parties formally confirmed that they did not object to the constitution of the
Arbitral Tribunal (see Minutes of the Preliminary Hearing, 8 February 2012,
section 2). At this Meeting, the Parties discussed the time limits applicable to the
procedure, which were approved by the Arbitral Tribunal (see Minutes of the
Preliminary Hearing, 8 February 2012, section 4.3.4).

On 16 February 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
containing instructions as to the general conduct of the arbitration.

On 28 February 2012, Claimant informed the Arbitral Tribunal of the substitution
of its former legal counsel by Derains & Gharavi.

On 19 March 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.2 by
which it bifurcated the present proceedings as follows:

“The procedure shall be bifurcated. The jurisdictional phase shall be
carried out in accordance with the Timetable attached to this
Procedural Order.

The only matter for consideration during the preliminary phase on

jurisdiction shall be Claimant's standing under the BIT.”

On the same day, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning
the issue of confidentiality of the proceedings.

On 28 March 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided
not to hold a Hearing on jurisdiction.

79.

jurisdictional objection by declaring that Claimant has standing under the BIT to
bring claims against Uzbekistan, and proceed with the merits of the arbitration.

On 24 May 2012, Ms Carolyn Lamm informed the Arbitral Tribunal that
Respondent had replaced its representation, Dewey & LeBoeuf, with Carolyn
Lamm at White & Case LLP (hereinafter “White & Case”) due to the departure of
lawyers involved in Respondent’s previous representation. Ms Lamm advised that
the substitution had already taken place and that the decision had been
communicated to Dewey & LeBoeuf on 23 May 2012. Ms Lamm forwarded her
power of attorney to the Arbitral Tribunal.

On 24 and 29 May 2012, Claimant objected to the change of counsel contending
that White & Case was subject to a conflict of interest representing Uzbekistan
and requested that White & Case withdraw from their mandate within 48 hours.

On 1 June 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning
the amendment of the timetable applicable to the jurisdictional phase.

Between | June and 26 June 2012, the Parties exchanged various correspondence
regarding the issue of White & Case’s representation of Respondent.

On_13 June 2012, Respondent filed Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction

(hereinafter “Claim. Rej.J. 25.06.2012”) reiterating its previous request that the
Arbitral Tribunal dismiss Respondent’s jurisdictional objection by declaring that

proceed with the merits of the arbitration.

On 5 July 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal directed Claimant, in case it continued to
object to the representation of Respondent by White & Case, to file a formal
application for disqualification of White & Case by 6 July and in case it does so,
invited Respondent to provide a full response by 18 July 2014. The Arbitral
Tribunal further ruled that no further exchange of submissions would be allowed
afterwards, except as otherwise requested by Claimant and accepted by the
Arbitral Tribunal.

On 6 July 2012, Claimant submitted its Application for Disqualification of
Counsel for Respondent (hereinafter “Claim. Dis.CfR. 06.07.2012”).

Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (hereinafter
“Treaty”), concluded on 24 November 1993 by the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the
Republic of Uzbekistan (hereinafter “Contracting States”).

Article 8 of the Treaty contains the following provision:

of other States, opened for signature at Washington DC on 18 March
1965 and the Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation,
Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings); or

1.2 The Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal

The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules in their 2010 version, applicable to this procedure in accordance
with Article 8 of the Treaty. The Parties have raised no objections regarding the
constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal (see Minutes of the Preliminary Hearing, 8
February 2012, section 2). Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal is deemed validly
constituted.

1.3 The Arbitral Procedure

The Arbitral Tribunal has rendered a Decision on Jurisdiction, in which it rejected
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections with regard to Claimant’s standing and
whereby it left open further jurisdictional objections raised by the Parties (see
above para. 81). The Decision on Jurisdiction is hereby integrated into and forms
part of the present Award.

It is undisputed that Claimant is being assisted by a third party funder in this
arbitration proceeding. The Arbitral Tribunal has mentioned this fact in its
Procedural Order Nos. 6 and 7. However, this fact has no impact on this
arbitration proceeding.

133.

During the course of the arbitration proceedings, the Arbitral Tribunal issued 18
Procedural Orders ruling on various procedural incidents and requests. At this
point, no formal procedural request remains pending, subject to the Arbitral
Tribunal’s appreciation in this Award of the weight to be given to the Liquidation
Correspondence and the BDO Documents.

Based on the length of the proceedings, the number and scope of the Parties’
written submissions and correspondence, and the Hearings held, the Arbitral
Tribunal considers that the Parties have been provided with a_ sufficient
opportunity to make their case.

At the Hearing, neither Party raised any objection against the way in which the
Arbitral Tribunal conducted the proceedings (Transcripts of 3 May 2014 (Day 6),
1531:22 - 1534:13). As concerns Respondent’s request expressed at the end of the
Hearing to be given an opportunity to provide post-hearing comments, the
Arbitral Tribunal considers that such opportunity has been duly granted in view of
the various post-hearing correspondence and the Parties’ two Post-Hearing Briefs.

On 27 October 2015, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that it was in a position to
render its Final Award and declared the proceedings closed.

Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal hereby issues its Final Award.

1583.18. [Set-Off Claim] Order Respondent to pay the above amounts
outside of Uzbekistan without any right of set-off;

1583.19. [Residual Claim] Order any other and further relief as the
Arbitral Tribunal shall deem appropriate. “

2.2 Respondent’s Prayer for Relief

134. In its Post-Hearing Reply, Respondent concluded as follows:

“69. For all the reasons set forth above, Respondent respectfully requests
that the Tribunal dismiss Claimant's claims in their entirety and issue
a decision in favor of Respondent in respect of its Counterclaims.
Respondent furthermore respectfully requests that it be awarded all

71

135.

the expense and costs associated with defending against Claimant's
claims.”

This Prayer for Relief is identical to the Prayer contained in Respondent’s
previous submissions, namely its Post-Hearing Brief (para. 155), Rejoinder (para.
999) and Statement of Defense (para. 547).

As concerns Respondent’s Counter-claims, they are not expressed in monetary
terms in Respondent’s Prayer for Relief itself, and it appears that they evolved
during the course of the arbitration as follows:

0)

(ii)

In its Statement of Defense, Respondent contended that “[a]s a
result of Claimant's unlawful conduct and breach of its investment
obligations, [...], Respondent has suffered damages amounting to
at least US$ 106.1 million” (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
545) and claimed that “Claimant is liable to Respondent for an
amount of not less than US$ 106.1 million and an accounting of all
financial transactions relating to its investments in the Republic of
Uzbekistan” (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 546).

In its Rejoinder, while Respondent further substantiated the legal
and factual basis of its Counter-claims and concluded that “the
Tribunal can and should adjudicate the counterclaims and find
Claimant liable for the damage it caused Respondent” (Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 977), it did not re-state its Counter-
claims. Instead, it referred to its Statement of Defense and Mr.
Hart’s Expert Reports concluding in its Rejoinder as follows:

“997. In both its Statement of Defense and above, Respondent has
plainly demonstrated that Claimant’s violations have caused
financial damage to Respondent both in its capacity as the
State, and as a shareholder of Goskomgeology and NGMK,
shareholders in the AGF Joint Venture.

998. Finally, Respondent’s expert, Mr. Hart, has calculated the
minimum amount of damage that Respondent has suffered as a
result of Claimant's misrepresentations, fraud, self-dealing,
other violations of Uzbek law in the operation of AGF, and
mismanagement of AGF. In his first report, Mr. Hart delineated
and quantified Respondent’s damages arising from Claimant’s
violations, and he reiterates and updates his observations as to
Claimant’s actions herein. Mr. Hart maintains that, at a
minimum, Claimant’s actions resulted in US$ 109 million in
damages.” [references omitted]

72

In his second Expert Report submitted with Respondent’s Rejoinder (ER-
Hart II (20.02.2014), para. 348), Mr. Hart summarizes Respondent’s
Counter-claims as follows:

(iii) In its Post-Hearing Reply (para. 68), Respondent concluded as
follows as concerns its Counter-claims:

“The Tribunal thus should hold Claimant liable for the substantial
damage that Respondent has suffered as a result of Claimant’s
unlawful conduct, including Claimant’s failure to pay sums admittedly
owed to the Ministry of Finance under the Special Dividend
Agreement, the numerous self-interested transactions that Claimant
caused AGF to enter into with Claimant and/or its affiliates, and its
operation of AGF in violation of the Republic’s currency law,
totalling US$ 117.54 million.” [references omitted]

As concerns the amount of USD 117.54 million, Respondent contends that
it is based on the Table 9.1 of ER-Hart IT (20.02.2014) (see above (ii))
whereby the amounts therein were updated to reflect interest on the
Special Dividend as of 21 July 2014, as well as additional damages caused
by AGF’s payment to MRT (of USD 4.42 million as illustrated in Table
3.2 of ER-Hart II (20.02.2014) (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, footnote 299).

As such, the amount of USD 117.54 million is composed as follows:

These conclusions largely reflect the conclusions drawn in Respondent’s
Post-Hearing Brief (paras. 152-154).

3. The Structure of the Present Award

136. Before entering into the merits of the issue, the Arbitral Tribunal should in
principle deal with any remaining jurisdictional objections. In the present case,
both Claimant and Respondent raised jurisdictional objections which have not
been addressed in the Decision on Jurisdiction:

(i) Respondent's jurisdictional objections: In its S of Defense,
Respondent raised jurisdictional objections which appeared to be
directed at Claimant’s Claims in general (see Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, section V.B, paras 348 fol.). However, as of its
Rejoinder, Respondent raised these jurisdictional objections with
regard to the Claims relating to the AGF Project only. Actually,
these objections are either included in the sections dedicated to the
AGF Claims (see Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, section VII: “AGF
Legal Argument”) or expressly limited to the AGF Project (see
Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014 and Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, sections
Ill: “The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant’s AGF Claims
and/or they are inadmissible”, emphasis added). The same
conclusion arises from Respondent’s Counsel Opening Statement
at the Hearing, in which Ms. Menaker stated as follows:
“Claimant's claims with _respect_to_AGF Phase I should be
rejected on jurisdictional and admissibility grounds [...]”

74

(Transcripts of 28 April 2014, 185:24 - 186:2). As such,
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are not directed (anymore)
at the Claims relating to the Khandiza Project, but concern only the
AGF Project.

(ii) Claimant’s jurisdictional objections: In its various written
submissions, Claimant has raised objections towards the Arbitral
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Respondent’s Counter-claims and/or
their admissibility (see Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1452
fol.; Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 185 fol.).

137. To the extent that these objections are limited to certain parts of the Parties’
claims, in particular Claimant’s AGF Claims and Respondent’s Counter-claims,
the Arbitral Tribunal considers it more appropriate to deal with these objections

when dealing with the claims concerned thereby.

138. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal will examine the Parties’ claims according to the
following order:

- It will first deal with the claims relating to the Khandiza Project (B.I1);
- It will then deal with the claims relating to the AGF Project, including
Respondent’s Counter-claims (B.III) and, in this context, examine the

Parties’ respective jurisdictional and admissibility objections;

- Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal will address the issue of the costs (C).

Il. The Claims Regarding the Khandiza Project
139. After a summary of the key facts underlying Claimant’s claims in the Khandiza

Project (1), the Arbitral Tribunal will briefly present the claims themselves (2)
before examining the various issues relating thereto (3).

L The Key Facts

1.1 The Primary Exploration Agreement and Phase 1
140. On 14 December 1996, ORC and Goskomgeology entered into the PEA (see
above para. 35, Exh. C-40) in relation to the Khandiza Deposit and a 12,000 km?

area surrounding it and expanding to the north of the Deposit (hereinafter

75

“Expanded Area”). This Agreement was entered into for a duration of five years,
i.e., until 14 December 2001, unless the parties agreed in writing to extend the
Agreement.

Relevant provisions of the PEA provide as follows:
“I. OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Agreement is to develop the initial framework of a feasibility
study of the Khandiza Polymetallic Deposit and geological additional study within
the region immediately surrounding the Khandiza Deposit (hereinafter, collectively
the "Property," as further defined in the Annex 1), and to carry out the exploration
works at the expanded surrounding area to delineate perspective sites, to set out
exploration works and to choose the properties to be further worked out
(hereinafter, the "Expanded Area" as further defined the Annex 2). In order to
achieve these objectives. Goscomgeologia shall grant to Oxus:

1) exclusive rights to carry out exploration within the Property and the Expanded
Area;

2) access to all maps, results of preceding works and other information related to
the Property and the Expanded Area and right to photocopy such materials;

3) pulps from previous core drills, mine workings, and right to reanalyze them;

4) right to take out the information received, samples of ores and rocks outside of
the Republic of Uzbekistan;

5) ability to import equipment necessary for exploration;
6) right to establish temporary infrastructure to facilitate exploration;
Oxus will provide:

1) financing and shall prepare a preliminary feasibility study (hereinafter the
"Phase 1 Study") which shall be completed no later than December 31 1997,
will include a proposal on mining, milling, positioning of a concentrator,
tailings storage and other infrastructure; marketing and environmental impact
studies; and an analysis of the feasibility of development; detailed purposes and
terms and conditions of cooperation are described in the Annex 3.

2) financing of works for geological studies in the Expanded Area which will
include the accumulation of regional geological information scaled to
1:500.000 - 1:100.000, the analysis and computerised processing thereof to
identify the areas where new deposits etre likely to be found; accumulation of
more detailed information on a prospective area identified in 1:50.000 —
1:10.000 scale with the aim of identifying specific deposits with promising
reserves, exploration works carried out to evaluate the deposits discovered.

76

2. RESULTS OF WORKS

In the event of positive outcome of the Phase I Study, the Parties will initiate the
negotiations on a Joint Venture Agreement under mutually acceptable for the
Parties. The objective for such a Joint Venture shall be to complete a full bankable
feasibility study and commercial development of economically viable deposits
within the territory of the Property.

 

In the event of negative outcome of the Phase I Study, Oxus shall not claim for any
reimbursement of costs incurred in the process of developing the feasibility study
and will be obligated to cede back to Goskomgeologia all geological materials
previously obtained therefrom.

If in the result of geo-exploration works in the Expanded Area a commercially
viable ore mineral deposit is discovered, Oxus should properly notify the State
Geology Committee. Despite the fact that exploration may continue in other parts
of the Expanded Area, Oxus shall be prepared to enter into a Joint Venture with
Goskomgeologia to develop such a deposit in a commercial scale.

All negotiations on future agreements regarding the Expanded Area will remain
separate and intact from any stipulations contained in this Agreement regarding a
Joint Venture Agreement pertaining to the Property.

3. DURATION

This Agreement shall be effective for a period of five (5) vears from the date hereof.
The Parties may agree in writing to extend this Agreement. After termination of
this Agreement, each Party shall be free from any obligation or liability to the
other Parties stipulated in this Agreement, except for the obligations specified in
Section 9 herein.

Oxus hereby agrees that after one (1) year from the effective date of this Agreement
(or earlier, if the Parties mutually agree) and after completion of the Phase I
Study, it will enter into formal negotiations with Goscomgeologia to create a Joint
Venture Agreement pertaining to the Property, or it shall cede the Property back to
Goscomgeologia, should such an arrangement for a Joint Venture Agreement be
not achieved.

Oxus also agrees that after three (3) years, it shall cede those areas of the
Expanded Area where it has adopted a decision not to conduct further exploration,
where the ceded areas shall constitute no less than fifty percent (50%) of the
Expanded Area. Oxus shall have the right to proceed with exploration in
accordance with this Agreement for within two (2) years on the remaining portions
of the Expanded Area for two (2) years with the preferential right of further
extension in the event of prospective sites discovered.

77

4. DECLARATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

Goscomgeologia hereby states and guarantees that:

from the effective date of this Agreement, and over the period of the Agreement,
the terms of any previous agreements should not materially influence or prevent
Goscomgeologia from carrying out its obligations under this Agreement;

 

i. for the period of this Agreement, it has not and shall not enter into any similar
agreements granting any form of exploration, exploitation or other metal
mineral-related rights to third foreign parties or parties with foreign
participation with respect to the Property or Expanded Area except for previous
agreements which have been mutually reviewed and accepted by both Parties;

i. by entering into this Agreement, it shall not violate any other agreements or
treaties, and that this Agreement, once signed, is effective and binding thereof;
and

. after one ( 1) year from the effective date of this Agreement, it will enter into
formal negotiations with Oxus to create a Joint Venture Agreement pertaining
to the Property. If Goskomgeologia shall, with the positive results of the Phase
1 Study, waive of entering into Joint Venture Agreement pertaining to the
Property, and if, within three (3) years [i.e., until 10 July 1997] of the signing of
this Agreement Goscomgeologia shall enter into negotiations for a Joint
Venture Agreement pertaining to the Property with an independent party, then
Goscomgeologia shall reimburse Oxus for all expenses incurred during the
Phase I Study plus an additional fifteen percent (15%) of those expenses.

  

Oxus hereby states and guarantees that:

it is a duly registered company;

it is capable of entering into this Agreement, and all procedural requirements
that make it eligible to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement have been duly carried out;

i. by entering into this Agreement, it shall not violate any other agreements or
treaties, and that this Agreement, once signed, is effective and binding thereof;

. it is financially able to meet its obligations under this Agreement;

all results of studies including field materials, surveys of any types, results of
analyses, interpretation materials and any other information obtained in the
progress of works under this Agreement will be regularly exchanged with
Goskomgeologia on the confidential basis;

i. upon the termination of the exploration, it is obligated to return the affected
land and environment to its original state according to environmental
standards; and remove all equipment and structures, unless they are useful to
the local community; and

78

vii. upon the termination of the exploration, should the results be negative, it is
obligated to return all information received in connection with the Property and
Expanded Area.

For avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Goskomgeologia shall not be
materially responsible fro any expenses incurred by Oxus in connection with
geoexploration works within the Property and Expanded Area in the event if no
commercially viable deposit will have been found within the territory.

141. After the signature of the PEA, Claimant started the exploration works.
142. On 31 May 1997, upon ORC’s mandate, Snowden issued a report concerning the

set-up by ORC of a computer database for the resource evaluation of Khandiza
(hereinafter “Snowden Report”) (Exh. C-157) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,

para. 137).
143. On 10 July 1997, ORC and Goskomgeology entered into the Supplemental

Agreement No. I to the PEA (Exh. R-21), through which the parties amended
various sections of the PEA, including the following:

On 22 July 1997, ORC entered into an Agreement to Assign (hereinafter
“Assignment No. 1”) with OML, under which the PEA was assigned to OML
(Exh. C-41).

On 4 August 1997, the Uzbekistan State Geological Fund issued the Certificate of
Registration No. 97/56/1 to OML (Exh. C-152).

On 8 September 1997, ORC’s legal advisors, Cameron McKenna wrote a letter to
Mr. Wilkins concerning their review of the PEA.

On 11 September 1997, Goskomgeology issued a Guarantee Letter to OML (no
copy of this letter was provided to the Arbitral Tribunal):

84

148. On 25 September 1997, Oxus issued its Preliminary Prospectus for its planned
listing at the AIM (Exh. C-154). This Preliminary Prospectus provided as follows
regarding Khandiza (p. 10):

“The Company has a primary exploration agreement made effective as of
December 14, 1996 (as amended, the "Khandiza Exploration Agreement")
with the State Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources of the Republic
of Uzbekistan ("Goskomgeologia"), the specially authorized legal entity and
the Uzbek agency responsible for carrying out geological exploration and
extraction of minerals management in Uzbekistan. The stated purpose of the
Khandiza Exploration Agreement is: (i) to develop the initial framework of a
feasibility study of the Khandizazinc-copper-lead-silver deposit and
additional geological study within the surrounding area covering in
aggregate an 18 kilometre by 10 kilometre area (the "Khandiza Property"),
and (ii) to carry out exploration on an expanded surrounding area covering
an aggregate of approximately 12,000 square kilometres (the."Expanded
Area") to delineate prospective sites for further work.

Under the Khandiza Exploration Agreement, Goskomgeologia granted to the
Company (or agreed to provide necessary support for the Company to
obtain) the exclusive rights to carry out exploration within the Khandiza
Property and the Expanded Area, and access to all maps and results of
previous work and other information relating to the Khandiza Property and
the Expanded Area. The Company has obtained all necessary approvals
required at this stage for exploration and release of geological data. The
Company is required to prepare a preliminary feasibility study not later than
December 31, 1997 and to carry out geological studies of the Expanded
Area. The Khandiza Exploration Agreement contemplates the expenditure by
the Company on the Khandiza Property of $6,000,000, of which
approximately $1,300,000 has been spent to date and an additional amount
of approximately $200,000 is expected to be spent by the end of 1997. If the
preliminary feasibility study is positive, the parties are to enter into
exclusive good faith negotiations to create a joint venture with the objective
of completing a fully bankable feasibility study and commercial development
of economically viable deposits within the Khandiza Property, initially on,a
50-50 basis. If the preliminary feasibility study is negative (or a joint venture
is not achieved), the Company will be required to vacate the Khandiza
Property and return to Goskomgeologia all geological materials without
reimbursement of costs.”

149. On 21 October _1997, Cameron McKenna issued a second legal opinion
concerning their review of the PEA, the Supplementary Agreement No. 1, the
Assignment No. I and various applicable laws, treaties and regulations, including
also the Guarantee Letter (Exh. C-155). This second legal opinion was meant to
supersede Cameron McKenna previous letter to Mr. Wilkins of 8 September 1997
(see above para. 146). In this legal opinion, Cameron McKenna reached — among
others — the following conclusion:

5. We are of the opinion that the Primary Exploration Agreement, the
Guarantee Letter, and the Certificate of Registration as well as the
other approvals and letter referred to in paragraph 3 above provide
sufficient evidence at this stage that Oxus Mining enjoys the sole right
to carry out exploration of the Khandiza deposit. Under Article 14 of
the Subsoil Law, the person or persons who finance exploration have
an exclusive right to obtain a license for extraction, i.e. mining. In the
light of Oxus Mining instructing us that it and/or its parent company,
Oxus Resources, has spent approximately US$1.09 million on such
exploration up to 12 October 1997, it is reasonable to conclude, on the
documents and facts known to us and on the assumption that Oxus
delivers a pre-feasibility study to the State Committee of Geology by the
due date referred to in the Primary Exploration Agreement, that Oxus
Mining together with such State Committee, its exploration co-venturer,
will have established an exclusive right to a mining license at the
appropriate time and subject to the usual regulatory approvals in the
normal course of an exploration project proceeding towards the
construction and mining stages.” (emphasis added)

150. On_17 December 1997, Mr. Roger Turner (from OML) sent a letter to Mr.
Shayakubov (Chairman of Goskomgeology) reporting on the status of the Phase 1
Study and stated as follows (Exh. R-267):

“TI hope the Khandiza trip to Toronto for Goskomgeologia was successful.
The results of the Phase I Feasibility Study are, on the whole, much as we
expected in terms of resources at various cut-off grades, metallurgy, mine
design and concentrator flow sheet. The operating cost estimates are
realistic but we have been working with Bechtel and Watts Griffis & McOuat
on the capital cost estimates with only limited success. I believe we need to
look at the project capital costs more critically using Uzbek contractors and
prices as the first stage of the Phase 2 study. For a 1 million ton a year
project the capital costs should be in the US$ 120M to US$ I 40M range I
believe this can be achieved and we will start a critical review of this with
your staff's assistance early next year. This, together with detailing the terms
of the Joint Venture Agreement should be our main priority together with the
refurbishment of the underground workings. We should be ready to
commence an underground diamond drill programme in May to upgrade the
B category resources, supply geotechnical data for stope design, and for
hydrological studies and bench scale metallurgical test-work. I had hoped to
be in Tashkent before the end of the year but we ere currently working on a
stock exchange listing for Oxus, which has kept me from making the trip.
However, I look forward to discussing the way forward on Khandiza with
you early in the New Year. [...]”

151. On 19 December 1997, by letter No. 08-1370, Mr. Shayakubov (Chairman of
Goskomgeology) responded to Mr. Turner’s (from OML) letter of 17 December
1997 stating as follows (Exh. C-159):

“Goskomgeology acknowledges that the company Oxus completed the first
Phase of the feasibility study on polymer-metallic deposit of Khandiza and
achieved the goals and objectives of the Primary Agreement for exploration,
signed on 14 December 1996, and additional agreement of 10 July 1997.

Based on the results of the first phase, Goskomgeology intends to enter into
exclusive negotiations with Oxus in order to create a Joint Venture under the
additional conditions of the Primary Agreement for exploration.”

152. On 31 December 1997, WGM issued the “Phase 1 Feasibility Study on the
Khandiza_ Project in Uzbekistan for Oxus Resources Corporation”
commissioned by ORC (hereinafter “WGM Phase | Feasibility Study”) (Exh. C-
151). WGM drew the following conclusions and made the following
recommendations:

“17.1 CONCLUSIONS

Economic mineral deposits exist in the Central Asian republics in a variety
of geologic settings, and the recent start-up of Cameco's Kumtor gold mine
in Kyrgyzstan, the Zarafshan-Newmont gold project in Uzbekistan and
Nelson Gold's Jilau gold mine in Tajikistan indicate that western based
economics and mining methods can be applied with success in the area.

Oxus has acquired an Exploration Licence in Uzbekistan which includes the
Khandiza deposit. WGM has concluded that at an NSR dollar cutoff of $30
per tonne and taking estimated dilution and mining losses into account for
each ore zone, the estimated mineable reserve is 12.1 million tonnes at a
grade of 7.1% Zn, 3.4% Pb, 1.0% Cu, 124 g Ag/t and 0.5 g Au/t.

WGM has used the discounted cash flow approach to evaluate the Khandiza
project. At a production rate of 1. 0 million tonnes per year, the project
shows an internal rate of return of 15.4%.

17.2 RECOMMENDATIONS

WGM recommends that Oxus proceed with a Bankable Feasibility study on
the Khandiza project which would begin on January 1, 1998.

The work will include diamond drilling for additional confirmation of
resources, infill drilling to increase the proven and probable reserves;
provision of samples for metallurgical testwork and data for geotechnical
and hydrological studies; additional bulk sampling and metallurgical
testwork; environmental baseline and impact studies; concentrator, tailings
disposal and infrastructure site investigation studies; detailed mine, process,
tailings disposal and infrastructure designs; equipment selection and capital

87

and operating cost estimates; detailed marketing studies; and manpower
training requirements.

The cost of this study is estimated at $4.7 million.”

1.2. The Negotiations Towards an Acceptable Bankable Feasibility Study

153. From June to August 1998, Claimant and Barents Group LLC prepared economic
models in order to estimate the profits that would derive from the Khandiza
Project for Claimant and Goskomgeology respectively after consideration of the
applicable Uzbek taxes (Exhs. R-909 to R-911). Based on their economic model
of 11 August 1998, the result of Barent’s calculations was as follows (Exh. R-
911_6):

Total profit of Uzbek Sides (in USD, thousand)

Net Present
rate
Net Present

 

154. On 4 September 1998, Mr. Shayakubov as Chairman of Goskomgeology sent a
letter to the Deputy Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, Mr. Viktor Anatolyevich
Chzhen, updating him on the progress of the negotiations with Oxus, stating —
inter alia — as follows (Exh. R-268):

“Ld

Idea of works execution at Khandiza deposit on the conditions of concession
is perceived positively in general by Oxus. Currently, development of the
economic model is being executed; legal aspects of this issue are being
studied. Proposals on the most acceptable form of participation in the
project for Oxus are to be provided by mid of October.

88

According to information at our disposal, exploration works and deposit
exploitation is carried out on the conditions of concession in the developed
market economy. [...]

Almost all foreign investors investing to mining industry of the Uzbekistan
Republic still prefer to create joint ventures instead of getting object
concession. In our opinion, it is caused by a number of the following

 

to

reasons:

- Legislation for creation and activities of joint venture is more
developed than concession legislation.

- There are substantial differences in conditions of activities at creation
of JV and concession: [...]

Lack of legislative acts regulating effect of the Law of the Republic of
Uzbekistan "On Concessions", lack of concession experience of the Republic
substantially holds back initiative of foreign investors and complicates work
on implementation of the above mentioned law. We would consider

ble to arrange develoy of the legislation for ion under
the guidance of the Investment Programs Department of the Cabinet of
Ministers with participation of foreign specialists and ministers and
authorities of the Republic concerned.”

155. On 18 September 1998, Mr. Wilkins from OML sent a letter to Mr. Shayakubov
from Goskomgeology explaining Oxus’ expectation regarding the structure of a
partnership on the Khandiza Project and stating — inter alia — as follows (Exh. R-
269):

“Ld

As was stated in our letter of 25 Aug. 1998, for the project to have a
profitability level acceptable for Oxus, we have tried to arrange for the
following criteria to be met with due regard to the prices of metals:

- the minimal rate of in-house profits of Oxus: 20%;

- the minimal share of Oxus: 45% of the cash flow before taxes, royalties
and project management fees;

- the minimal equity interest of Oxus in the Joint Venture: 50%.

(1

We have already submitted to you our economic model as to the Khandiza
project assuming that the output will amount to I million tons a year. The
model is based on the preliminary feasibility studies made by WGM in
December 1997 and improved through the repeated count of stocks by
Snowden Associates in May 1998. The Barents Group has analyzed the

model and c d its i ‘y with current legislation of Uzbekis

89

and, consequently, its tax-free period for seven (7) years after the
commencement of production, and the profits rate of 16%. All the other
assumptions we were based on are explicit in the model. For example, we
assumed the project to be exempt from VAT and dues on imported goods and
services required for the project to be implemented as well as that
expatriates engaged in the project to be exempt from taxes on their
salaries.”

Mr. Wilkins then listed a series of tax reduction and exemptions that would be
needed. As concerns the structure of the “legal and commercial structure” of
the Project, Mr. Wilkins was suggesting two different options, (i) an ordinary
joint-stock company, i.e. JV, and (ii) a concession, along the following lines:

“We provide two different options. The first option is just a standard
approach under which Oxus and Goscomgeologia will co-own a joint-stock
company. The second option is an approach under which Oxus will develop
the project by means of concession.

1) Ordinary-joint-stock company

Anakhita Mining Company can be set up as a joint-stock company registered
in Uzbekistan and co-owned by Oxus and Goscomgeologia. [...]

In order to make the required rate of profit available to Oxus and to render
the project sufficiently attractive for creditors, the joint-stock company's
commercial structure suggested by us is as follows:

- the same reductions and exemptions of taxes as those aforesaid;
-  Oxus owns 66.67%, Goscomgeologia - 33.33%;

- 7% of the production costs is payable to Oxus as project management
fees;

-  12%-rate on excise loans is payable to Oxus;

- Dividends in the amount of 66.67% are payable to Oxus, and those
amounting to 33.33% - to Goscomgeologia.

LJ
2) Concession

The Khandiza deposit may be developed in the form of concession. However,
the existing Law on Concessions (August 1995) is superfluously concise, so
either amendments thereto or new statutory acts and regulatory instruments
will be necessarily required together with supplementary documents
protecting the rights to concession. In such an approach Oxus (as a foreign
corporate body) will be the owner of concession. In this case, Oxus will be
able to create Anakhita Mining Company as a production enterprise and
hold 100%-equity interest therein. [...]

90

In order to make the required rate of profit available to Oxus, we would
suggest the possible concession structure be as follows:

- the same reductions and exemptions of taxes as those aforesaid, in
addition, Oxus could pay a higher rate of profits after the expiration of
a tax-free period of 7 years (the rate may by 30%, rather than 16%);

-  Oxus will own 100% of the production enterprise;

- there will be no longer any need in considering the size of management
fees;

- there will be no longer any need in the payment of interest on loans to
shareholders;

- the concession amount of 10 million will be payable to the
Government, in doing so, $1 million will be payable after it is decided
to create the said enterprise, $1 million — after construction is
completed, and $8 million — after the designed capacity is reached (i.e.,
once the commercial production has commenced).

Mr. Wilkins concluded his letter as follows:

“For the reasons outlined above, and as concessions have not been in wide
use yet, we recommend the negotiations on Khandiza should be continued
in view of creating a standard joint venture, which is approved by a
resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers. We think that both parties' good faith
and expedited work must make it possible to prepare the required documents
until the end of December 1998. This will enable us to instruct independent
consultants to get down to making the bank feasibility studies in early 1999
based on the survey currently conducted by Oxus and will be completed by
that time.

In spite of our restrained attitude to concession, we acknowledge it to be
promising for both Uzbekistan and foreign investors. As a consequence,
we'll be delighted to continue discussing its advantages and, if concession
appears to be more viable and a better option than a standard joint venture,
we'll be ready to discuss an opportunity of structuring our relations with
respect to Khandiza in the form of concession.

We are preparing a brief comparison of the approaches to concession in
different countries world-wide and will provide it to you in a few days.”
(emphasis added)

156. On 23 November 1998, Mr. Wilkins from OML sent another letter to Mr.
Shayakubov, Chairman of Goskomgeology, with a “revised taxation and
commercial structure” proposal for the future development of Khandiza (Exh. R-
270). In his letter, Mr. Wilkins concluded as follows:

91

“Based on discussions already held with the EBRD and various western
banks, it is apparent that the concession route would be preferable when it
comes to providing finance for the project, since concessions are more
widely used as commercial structures within the international mining
industry. Khandiza would also be the first mining project to be developed
under a concession in Uzbekistan and, as such, would attract much
favourable publicity for Oxus and the Uzbek Government alike. A
successfully structural concession for a project such as Khandiza would,
hopefully, act as a catalyst to attract further foreign investment into the
Uzbek mining sector.

 

Oxus would like to propose, therefore, that the Government confirms to us
those issues raised in paragraph (4) above, as soon as possible, and that we
then proceed by way of concession. If this is the case we are confident that
minor changes can be made to the proposed commercial or tax structure in
order to allow Oxus an IRR of 20%.

We look forward to continuing these negotiations in the near future.”

(emphasis added)

157. On_11 December_1998, CSMA issued the Preliminary Feasibility Study
commissioned by ORC (hereinafter “CSMA Preliminary Feasibility Study”) (Exh.
C-156). The objectives of this study were as follows:

‘Led

e — review all available information on the Khandiza Deposit held by Oxus
in their Working and Samarkand offices;

© — review testwork results and comment on choice of a flotation route, and
the feasibility of using a coarser grind size;

© — review the current conceptual layouts and arrangements of the mine
and plant areas, as indicated in the WGM study of December 1997;

e provide revised capital and operating cost estimates;

e — revise the financial model provided by Oxus to indicate the potential
viability of the deposit based on metal prices agreed by Oxus, and

e provide a plan of work and an estimated cost for a Definitive Feasibility
Study.” (p. 4)

The CSMA Preliminary Feasability Study concluded as follows:
Le]

CSMA concludes that despite current low metal prices the Khandiza project
is sufficiently robust to justify the completion of an agreement with Min Geo

92

158.

159.

160.

and the government of Uzbekistan, and to proceed with the preparation of a
Definitive Feasibility Study.

Based on these conclusions, CSMA recommends that:

e = Prior to the commencement of the DFS, further testwork must be
carried out on the effects of Dense Media Separation (DMS) on
representative samples of the ore;

e The current and planned programme of core drilling from both
underground and surface should be pursued with vigour in order to
improve levels of confidence in the resource as early as possible in the
DES period;

e Subject to a satisfactory conclusion to the current negotiations, Oxus
should proceed with a DFS as soon as practical, and conclude it as
expeditiously as possible.

In early 1999, OML initiated a program of further drilling works. For the purpose
of this drilling program, OML requested permission from Goskomgeology and
Samarkand Geology to use WMC Resources Limited drill rig. This request was
denied and OML was asked to contract out the drilling work to Kashkadarya
Expedition (hereinafter “Kashkadarya”) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 151-
153).

 

On 19 January 1999, Mr. Paul Lush, from Cameron McKenna (Claimant’s legal
advisor), sent a letter to Ms. Olga Firsova, Legal Counsel at Goskomgeology, in
view of a Meeting planned the next day between her and OML (Exh. R-520),
providing as follows:

“Oxus Mining tells us that the concession route for Khandiza has been
approved by Mr. Chzhen, Chairman of the GKI, and that the concept has
been submitted to President Karimov's office for further approval. We also
understand from informal conversations with Mr Shayakubov that he would
also agree to the concession route in principle.

Our clients believe, and we would support their belief, that ultimately a
formal concession agreement could make it easier to finance the project.”

Cameron McKenna then laid out a series of draft outlines of key agreements
necessary under a concession route.

On 22 January 1999, Mr. Wilkins from OML sent a letter to Mr. Chzhen, Deputy
Prime Minister, entitled “Request for the ‘Concession route’ for the Khandiza
Project to be officially approved by the Government of the Republic of
Uzbekistan” (Exh. R-271), in which he set out the perceived advantages of the

93

161.

162.

concession route and requested Mr. Chzhen’s formal approval thereof. In this
regard, the letter stated — inter alia — as follows:

“Oxus Company has taken great pleasure in working on the Khandiza
polymetallic project in Sukhandaryn Region and is very appreciative of the
support it has received so far from the State Committee for Geology and
from other Government Ministries. We are pleased to confirm that we have
completed our pre-feasibility study on the project, and have secured work on
the Bankable Feasibility Study. [...]

We understand that you approve Oxus taking the Concession route as
opposed to the joint venture route for the Khandiza Project. As we identified
in our letter to Mr. Shayakubov dated 23 November 1998 and Cameron
McKenna’s letters to Mr. Maksudov of 25 September and 8 Octobre 1998,
the Concession route is not free from certain difficulties. For example, the
Concession Law requires that the investor (or concessionaire) is a foreign
legal entity and not an Uzbek legal entity. Regrettably, under the current
wording of the new Tax Code, this means that the concessionaire would not
be able to qualify for the Foreign Investment Programme, and so have the
various tax privileges necessary to make the project economic. However
goodwill on both sides and appropriate decrees, there is no real reason to
think that these technical, legal problems cannot be resolved.

We believe that the Concession route has significant advantages to the joint
venture route as it is far more widely recognised approach to the
internationally mining sector. [...]

It would be very helpful if your approval could be given quickly because
Oxus would like to instruct its lawyers by I“ February 1999 to prepare a
preliminary draft Concession Agreement with a view to concluding all
major aspects of the negotiations with the Government by the end of April.
[...]” (emphasis added)

It appears that no significant event concerning Khandiza occurred between
February 1999 and January 2000.

On 5 January 2000, senior Government officials, including the Deputy Prime
Minister Mr. Chzhen, and Goskomgeology, including its new Chairman Mr.
Akhmedov, met and discussed whether to develop Khandiza as a concession
(Exh. R-279) based on a comparative table of costs and profits for both JV and
concession options prepared by Claimant (Exh. R-748). This table recorded a total
profit of USD 89.9 million for the Uzbek State in case of a concession (including
USD 53 million in taxes and royalties and USD 37 million in concession fees,
including an initial payment of USD 15 million within three years of registering
the enterprise (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 73; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014,
para. 116)) compared to 95.7 million in case of a JV.

  

94

The Minutes of this Meeting record the following decision:
“The Participants of the Meeting have decided:

1. To provide Goskomgeology and Oxus Resources Corporation with final
estimation data on creation of concession enterprise.

2. To Goskomgeology:

- to work out issue of obtaining of additional financial funds by Uzbek
party at changing of terms and volumes of extraction at transfer of the
right to develop deposit to Oxus and also to consider mechanism of
change of royalty amount from Khandiza deposit exploitation in
conditions of excess of the level of prices on the main extraction
products previously agreed upon;

- together with the representatives of Oxus to consider availability of
reimbursement of the Committee costs incurred during exploration
works at Khandiza deposit, to provide for possibility of supply of copper
concentrate produced by concession enterprise for processing to
Almalyk GMK and development of infrastructure in the given region.

3. To make the appropriate suggestions to the Government of the Republic
of Uzbeki: after final apy l of the ditions of 5 iphs 1, 2
with Oxus.””

 

163. On 29 January 2000, Mr. Akhmedov, Chairman of Goskomgeology and Mr.
Wilkins from OML entered into a Letter of Intent for the development of the
Khandiza ore Deposit (Exh. R-280), stipulating as follows:

“The Parties have agreed on the following:

J. Within 3-month period from signing of the present letter of intent to
prepare draft Concession Agreement for its submittal to the
Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

2. To take into consideration that Oxus undertakes to make the following
payments to the Uzbek party (Government and Goskomgeology):

- Initially fixed concession payment in the amount not less than 15
mln USD within first 3 years after registration of enterprise by
installments, amounts and due time of which will be additionally
approved by the parties;

- Current fixed concession payment in the amount not less than I
min. USD annually after production of the first products by the
enterprise within the whole term of operation life time of the
enterprise, and minimal term of operation is 15 years;

- General fixed amount of concession payments should be not less
than 30 min USD;

95

164.

165.

- Variable amount of concession payment that is not less than 5% of
net profit (after taxes);

- The Parties in the Concession Agreement will determine mutually
acceptable mechanism of additional variable concession payments,
if real results of operation activities will show considerable
improvement of the project economy compared to preliminary
feasibility study and if newly explored on the concession territory
ore reserves that were not included into bank feasibility study will
be included into development.

-  Oxus will pay taxes and other payments according to the current
legislation of the Uzbekistan Republic, taking into accounts
benefits that may be provided by the Government.

The Parties agree to determine mutually acceptable minimum and
maximum marginal prices for each metal (zinc, copper, lead); in case of
reduction of actual prices lower minimal amount, tax rate benefits will
be stipulated for use of mineral resources (royalty), in case of growth of
prices higher than maximum amount, mechanism of equitable
distribution of additional profit will be developed.

At concentrators shipment Oxus will prefer Almalyk Mining and
Metallurgical Complex provided that Almalyk complex possesses
appropriate capacities and all relations are built on the reasonable
internationally accepted economic conditions.

Bank FS will provide for development of the appropriate social
infrastructure of the region.

Concession Agreement will consider directions of funds' use from
capital equipment depreciation.

At liquidation of the enterprise all remaining assets are divided in the
equal shares: 50% -to the Uzbek party, 50% - to Oxus.”

It appears that no significant event concerning Khandiza occurred between

February 2000 and May 2000.

On 9 June 2000, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of OML and Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of

Goskomgelolgy entered into Supplemental Agreement No. 2 to the PEA (Exh. C-
161), in which the Parties further amended the PEA. The key amendments
concerned the following points:

(i)

(ii)

The Expanded Area was reduced from 12,000 km? to approximately 6,000

Oxus shall spend a minimum of USD 500,000 on exploration and other work
in respect of the Expanded Area over a two year period.

96

This reduction of the Expanded Area is not subject to controversy between the
Parties, both agreeing that it was contemplated under the PEA (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 281, 355; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 167).

166. On 1 August 2000, Mr. Maksudov, Deputy Head of the Department of Investment
Programs of the Cabinet of Ministers, sent a Letter No. 19/16-191 to
Goskomgeology (Exh. C-597) stating as follows:

“We inform hereby that #266 Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers “On
additional measures to organize the activity of Amantaytau Goldfields Joint
Venture” adopted on 11 July 2000 does not restrict Amantaytau Goldfileds
Joint Venture in obtaining loans from a third party provided any such loans

obtained to conduct the JV activity at stage I are arranged by Oxus Resource
Corporation and do not require guarantees of Government of the Republic
of Uzbekistan.”

167. On 16 August 2000, Mr. Akhmedov, Chairman of Goskomgeology, forwarded a
draft concession agreement (hereinafter “Draft Concession Agreement I’’) to the

Department of Investment Programs of the CabMin for its “approval and
decision-making” (Exhs. R-282/R-283). According to this Draft Concession

168. On 29 September 2000, Mr. Akhmedov, Deputy Head of the Department of

169.

170.

Investment Programs of the CabMin, sent a letter to Goskomgeology attaching the
feedback from relevant ministries and departments on the Draft Concession
Agreement I and the draft Decrees of the CabMin (Exh. R-284).

By the end of 2000, Claimant completed a drilling programme of 31 underground
holes (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 151 fol.)

On _ 23 May 2001, based on feedback received from various ministries and
departments which had set up a working group to review the concession

Goskomgeology resubmitted an updated draft of concession

agreement (hereinafter “Draft Concession Agreement II”) (Exh. R-285) and a

99

171.

draft Decree of CabMin (Exh. R-983) addressing the feedback received from the
various ministries and departments.

The draft Decree of CabMin provided as follows:
“[...] the Cabinet of Ministers decides:

J. To provide “Oxus Resources Corporation” company (UK) for the
development with Khandiza polymetallic deposit, which is located in
Surkhandarya region, according to Appendix.

2. To authorize the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on
Geology and Mineral Resources:

to sign an agreement with “Oxus Resources Corporation” company for
the development of Khandiza polymetallic deposit;

to issue a license in due course for subsoil use within the territory
specified in Appendix.

3. To take note that upon the results of the developed bankable FS of the
project the specific form of cooperation with “Oxus Resources
Corporation” will be determined on the basis of the concession
agreement or production sharing agreement.

4. To provide “Oxus Resources Corporation” company with:

an exclusive right to perform geology explorations on the territory
specified in Appendix with the subsequent development of any of the
identified deposits in the specified territory for a period of development
and expertise of the project FS, with prolongation of this right in the case
of a decision on the further implementation of the project up to the full
development of the deposit;

a preferential right to provide new territory for the continuation of the
surveys and explorations in the case of not detecting cost-effective deposits
for development within the territory specified in Appendix.

  

On 16 October 2001, Mr. Newal from CSMA issued an “Audit Report on
Khandiza Drilling Programme and Revised Manual Resource Estimation”
(hereinafter “CSMA Resource Audit 2001”) (Exh. C-163). CSMA reported as
follows:

“Oxus believed that much of the previous work had been based on
unreliable density information and inappropriate ore characterisation. To
counter this, Oxus began a programme of underground drilling. By April
2001, 31 holes, totalling 3,776m, had been completed that significantly
improved the confidence of the resource base both in terms of ore body
geometry and ore parameters.

100

From this work, Oxus has been able to provide a revised resource estimate
based on a 2% and 5% zinc cut-off, and considering only eight of the nine
ore bodies as Ore body 1 was deemed to be sub-economic.

The Oxus resource work was carried out in accordance with traditional
Soviet cross-sectional and irregular blocking methods, using the B and Cl
resource categories. It is the opinion of CSMA that the categories defined
within the Soviet guidelines for polymetallic deposit resource evaluation, are
of sufficient confidence and reliability in this case, to be considered as
Measured and Indicated resources in western terminology (JORC 1999).

LJ

“CSMA has audited the drilling programme and resource calculation
methodology and is satisfied that both have been undertaken in a diligent
and correct manner.

The result is that Oxus now has a robust and detailed geological
interpretation of the deposit down to the I ,200m level elevation, and has
sufficient data to embark on a revised Datamine® computer software
resource evaluation as a basis for commencing a detailed mine design to full
feasibility study level.

[...]” (emphasis added)

CSMA further concluded as follows:
“10.0 EXPLORATION POTENTIAL
LJ

CSMA has reviewed much of the exploration data associated with these
areas and can conclude that many of the localities listed are of interest for
both gold and base metals, although nearly all are at an early stage of
exploration.

LJ
10.4 Conclusion

Recent re-interpretation work by Oxus has defined a number of drill targets
close to the existing Khandiza deposit, which CSMA believes provide a good
opportunity to increase the resources at the project.

In addition, along strike from Khandiza to the east lie a number of
interesting base metal prospects that require further investigation. Similarly,
several very promising mineral occurrences have been identified and partly
explored further afield within the SE Uzbekistan Exploration Concession,
although again, all are at an early stage of exploration.

101

172.

173.

Overall, CSMA believes that Oxus holds ground that has the potential to
host other significant base metal (and gold) deposits, but that considerable
work will be required to achieve this reality.

11.0 FUTURE WORK PROGRAMME & COSTS

CSMA recommends that Oxus should proceed with a revised Datamine®
cmnputer software resource evaluation as a basis for a detailed mine design
and engineering studies as part of the ongoing feasibility study.

Having completed the underground drilling programme and _ revised
geological interpretation, it is considered that the revised Feasibility Study
Cost, excluding further drilling and exploration and Initial Concession Fee
payment, is US$3.12m. Table 11.1 provides details of the cost centres.

On 30 November 2001, the Ministry of Finance provided CabMin with some
comments about the draft documents sent by Goskomgeology. Namely, the
Ministry of Finance indicated that it considered it “inappropriate to transfer
Khandiza deposit for use by ‘Oxus Resources Corporation’ prior to the provision
of the developed and approved FS or determination of the forms of cooperation
and share of the Uzbek party in the outcomes of the development” (Exh. R-
1106_1) (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 102).

On 14 December 2001, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeology and Mr.
Wilkins on behalf of ORC entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 3 to the
PEA (Exh. R-22), thereby amending the PEA as follows:

(i) | Extending the duration of the PEA for a further two years as of 14
December 2001, i.e. until 13 December 2003;

(ii) To add the following paragraph to Article 4(ii) of the PEA:

“Based on the fact that Goskomgeology is conducting exploration at its own
expense within the Expanded Area, the Parties hereby agree that in the event
that Goskomgeology makes a discovery of a potential deposit within the
Expanded Area as a result of such exploration, and Oxus subsequently takes
a decision to mine that deposit, then Oxus shall reimburse the exploration
expenditure incurred by Goskomgeology on that particular deposit from 1
January 1997 onwards. Goskomgeology hereby agrees to supply Oxus with
information on its expenditure in the Expanded Area from I January 1997,
and to keep Oxus informed as to the extent of its ongoing expenditure.”

In its preamble, the Supplemental Agreement No. 3 referred to the Parties’
discussion about a Concession Agreement as follows:

“WHEREAS Oxus and the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan are
currently in negotiation regarding the possibility of Oxus developing the

102

Property by way of a concession agreement or a production sharing
agreement;

WHEREAS Oxus wishes to complete a definitive feasibility study on the
Property and to commercially develop the Property on terms mutually
acceptable to the Parties;

LP

174. On 1 July 2002, OML (by then renamed Oxus Services Limited) assigned the
PEA to OMCL (later on renamed Marakand), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ORC,
(Exh. C-42; see above para. 7 and 8).

175.

176.

On _20 September 2002, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeolgy and Mr.
Wilkins on behalf of Marakand entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 4
to the PEA (Exh. C-164). By this Agreement, OMCL was formally made a party
to the PEA, thereby replacing ORC.

On 17 October 2002, CabMin issued ‘Decree No. 359 On the Development of the
Khandiza Polymetallic Deposit’ (hereinafter “Decree No. 359”) (Exh. C-165),
providing as follows:

“[...] the Cabinet of Ministers hereby:

I.

Grants to Oxus Resources Corporation the exclusive right to develop
the Khandiza Polymetallic Project (Surkhandariskaya Region) in
respect of the territory shown in Annex 1;

Authorises the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan for
Geology and Mineral Resources to sign an agreement with Oxus
Resources Corporation for the preparation of a feasibility study in
respect of the Khandiza Polymetallic Project;

Takes note that:

Oxus Resources Corporation together with Goskomgeologia are to
complete the development of a feasibility study within 24 months of the
date of this Decree [i.e., until 16 October 2004];

Oxus Resources Corporation is granted the exclusive right to conduct
exploration during the period in which such feasibility study is
prepared;

depending on the results of such feasibility study, Oxus Resources
Corporation shall have the exclusive right to conduct negotiations for
determining the concrete form of cooperation for the development of the
Project (concession agreement or production sharing agreement), as
well as the financing and other conditions for the development of the
Project;

103

+ Oxus Resources Corporation is granted a right of first refusal in respect
of the award of new parcels of land for the continuation of exploration
work in the event that commercially viable deposits are not discovered
in the territory shown in Annex 1,

+ Oxus Resources Corporation assumes the obligation to assure a full
geological study and the rational use of mineral resources.

177. On_16 October _2003, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeology, Mr.
Polikashin on behalf of ORC and Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus Gold and Oxus
Minerals entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 5 to the PEA (Exh. C-
49), which amended the PEA as follows:

(i) | Oxus Gold shall also become a Party to the Agreement until such
time as OMCL and Goskomgeology, with the approval of the
CabMin, have signed the appropriate agreement(s) on the further
development of the Property;

(ii) The duration of the PEA, which was to expire on 13 December
2003 according to the Supplemental Agreement No. 3 (see above
para. 173), was extended until 17 October 2004.

In its Preamble, the Supplemental Agreement No. 5 to the PEA referred as
follows to the Decree No. 359:

“WHEREAS, Decree # 359 adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers of the
Republic of Uzbekistan on 17 October 2002 granted ORC the exclusive
rights to develop the Property and noted that, inter alia, ORC shall complete
a feasibility study in respect of the Property by 16 October 2004 and, based
on the results of such study, shall have the exclusive rights to hold
negotiations to develop the Property by way of a concession agreement or a
production sharing agreement; ” (emphasis added)

178. On 24 October 2003, CSMA issued an “Expert Report on Khandiza and SE
Uzbekistan Exploration Areas” (hereinafter “CSMA Expert Report 2003”) (Exh.
C-163). This report was prepared in view of the AIM listing of Marakand, which
would be the entity in charge of developing the Khandiza Project. CSMA
concluded as follows concerning the estimated value of the Khandiza Project:

“CSMA is not able to apportion any definitive value to the Khandiza project
at this stage. However, a number of studies have been undertaken on this
project in recent years based on different resource bases, capital estimates,
metal prices and concentrate sales options etc. The present Marakand
approach is to proceed into a Feasibility Study at the earliest opportunity
and to examine in detail the various options for the mining, processing and

104

179.

180.

181.

likely concentrate marketing routes. Only at this point will a value be
realistically ascribed to the project.

All previous studies have shown that the project can exhibit net present
values in excess of £16M not including any upside potential for the
additional explorations areas. Accordingly, CSMA can confirm that subject
to base metal prices maintaining their present (October 2003) levels there is
every likelihood that the Khandiza Project Feasibility Study will indicate an
NPV in excess of £16M.”

On 4 December 2003, Marakand was listed on AIM of the London Stock
Exchange on the basis of the Khandiza Project. Upon listing, Marakand’s market
capitalization amounted to approximately USD 75 million (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, para. 195; Exhs. C-150/R-603). Marakand’s Offering Document
provided as follows as concerns its rights in the Khandiza Project:

“Marakand Minerals Limited together with Oxus and ORC has been granted
the exclusive rights to explore and develop the Khandiza Deposit, a zinc,
copper, lead, silver and gold deposit located in the Surkhandarya Province

 

of south Uzbekistan, subject to the iation of the appropriate form of
legal co-operation and the granting of necessary licences and permits.” (p.
12)

Between January and August 2004, LN Metals was able to secure for Marakand
letters of intent for the placement of concentrates with a number of reputable
smelters, including the AMGK, Ust-Kamenogorsk (Glencore), Asturiana de Zinc
(Xstrata), Chelyabinsk (Euromin) and LN Metals itself (Exhs. C-169 to C-173).
According to Claimant, these letters and their possible subsequent transformation
into sales agreement (Exhs. C-193 to C-196) confirmed that the Khandiza Deposit
was viable (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 184).

1.3. The Discussions Around the Bankable Feasibility Study: The Beginning
of the Deadlock

On 11 October 2004, within the 24 months time limit provided in Decree No. 359
(see above para. 176), Marakand submitted to Respondent the “Khandiza
Feasibility Study” (hereinafter “Khandiza Feasibility Study 2004” also referred to
as the “Bankable Feasibility Study”) (Exhs. C-149/R-182), which had been
audited by WAI. This Study, which is several hundreds of pages long, covered the
various aspects of the mining project including the costs assessment and economic
models envisaged.

According to this Bankable Feasibility Study, there would be three mining
Phases: (i) Phase 1: mining from 1300m elevation upwards to 1460m

105

elevation; (ii) Phase 2: mining from 1100m elevation upwards to 1300m
elevation; and (iii) Phase 3: mining below 1100m elevation (pp. 1-5). This
strategy would ensure that mining is started at the most productive elevations,
with the largest resource tonnes per vertical metre, and therefore the greatest
flexibility underground.

With regard to the status of negotiations between Marakand and
Goskomgeology, the Project Summary of the Bankable Feasibility Study
provided as follows:

“1.1 Introduction

The Khandiza Project is being proposed for development by Marakand
Minerals Limited (formerly known as Oxus Minerals Corporation Limited),
a company listed on AIM in London since December 2003.

LJ

Marakand holds rights to the Khandiza Project by virtue of Decree No. 359,
issued on 17 October 2002. This Decree was issued to Oxus Resources
Corporation and later assigned to Marakand. Pursuant to Decree No. 359,
Marakand has amongst others:

+ The exclusive rights to develop the Khandiza Project
+ To complete a feasibility study by 17 October 2004

+ The exclusive right to conduct negotiations for a concession or production
sharing agreement

The positive results of this Feasibility Study concludes the first leg in the
development process and Marakand will now continue to finalise the terms
of the proposed Concession Agreement.

LJ
1.11 Project Implementation

The feasibility study has made various developmental assumptions which
will require confirmation and completion during the pre-development and
construction phase. These assumptions include:

+ The completion of negotiations with Goscomgeologia and the Cabinet
of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan concerning the terms of the
Concession Agreement proposed by Marakand

+ Receipt of the formal Decree from the Cabinet of Ministers establishing
the formal rights to the Khandiza Project pursuant to the terms of the
Concession Agreement. The Decree will also include instructions for
assistance from the various Ministries of government for the permits
and other project related approvals required by Marakand to

106

implement development and construction activities, and ongoing
operational requirements

LP

According to Claimant, upon submission of this Study, Marakand’s market
capitalization reached its peak, at approximately USD 124 million (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 195, Charter WS).

182. On 15 October 2004, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeology and Mr. Stuart
on behalf of Marakand entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 6 to the
PEA (Exh. C-50). This Agreement was entered into in view of the expiration on
17 October 2004 of the Supplemental Agreement No 5 (see above para. 177) and
under the following context:

“L.]

WHEREAS, on the 11th October 2004 Marakand submitted the Khandiza
Feasibility Study to Goscomgeology in accordance with Decree No 359 of
the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated 17th October
2002, and wishes to commercially develop the Khandiza Polymetallic Mine
on the basis of a concession;

WHEREAS, the Parties are in the process of negotiating a Concession
Contract based on the provisions of Decree No 359 of the Cabinet of
Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated 11 October 2002;

WHEREAS, the Parties acknowledge that a further Decree of the Cabinet of
Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan.shall be required in order to grant
the concession under such a Concession Contract;

WHEREAS, Marakand has notified Goscomgeology on Ist of October 2004
that it wishes to continue exploration works within the areas, set out in the
Appendix to the present Supplementary Agreement # 6 (the "Territory");

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to petition the Cabinet of Ministers of the
Republic of Uzbekistan to confirm the exclusive rights of Marakand to carry
out geological exploration works within the Territory;”

Under this agreement, the Parties agreed on the following amendments to the
PEA with regard to the exploration of the Expanded Area:

“(i) Marakand agrees that the company shall be given the right to carry out
geological exploration works for the sole purpose of identifying
polymetallic mineralisations;

(ii) Goscomgeology shall reserve for itself the right to carry out geological
explorations works within the Territory in respect of all types of
valuable mineables;

107

(iii) the duration of the Primary Exploration Agreement shall be extended
until 31" December 2004, or if such date is earlier, till the moment of
the conclusion between Goscomgeology and Marakand of a New
Exploration Agreement in respect of the Territory replacing the
Primary Exploration Agreement.” (emphasis added)

As concerns the “Territory replacing the Primary Exploration Agreement”,
Appendix | to the Supplemental Agreement No. 6 defined such area in that it
reduced the previous Expanded Area from 5,259 km’ to 1,199.5 km’.

183. On 19 November 2004, Mr. Dabizha from AMGK, which formed part of the
working group in charge of reviewing the concession documents and provide
feedback to Goskomgeology, issued an “Expert Opinion as to the Feasibility
Study of Development of Khandiza Mutli-Metallic Ore Field Expressed by
Experts of the Joint-Stock Company Almalyk Mining and Metallurgical
Combine” (hereinafter “AMMC Expert Report”) (Exh. R-98). In this Expert
Opinion, AMMC concluded as follows:

“The main technical solutions proposed for construction of facilities of the
Khandiza Mining and Metallurgical Combine shall be positively assessed

LJ
At the same time:

J. Calculation of operating reserves at the zinc stoping limit of 4% shall
be approved as provided by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of
Uzbekistan (Article 37 of the Law on Subsoil).

2. In our opinion, operating costs of ore-processing are excessively high
compared to those at the Almalyk Mining and Metallurgy Combine.
They have to be recalculated and set out in more detail.

3. The level of detail of the financial and economic sections of the
feasibility study report is insufficient. Generalised calculations contain
all the cost items required, whilst there are some misprints as to the net
income (pages 14-16) and total income (pages 14-17), which did not
affect the results of the calculation. The internal rate of return made
28.3%.

4. Financial calculations have some reserve for an increase of the costs
including:

- incidental operating costs of 15% (see Section 12);

- electric power costs paid for at two tariffs (for normal and
overload modes) (see pages 12-4, paragraph 12.2.8);

- replacement of means of transportation (according to the norms
effective in the Republic of Uzbekistan, means of transport shall be
written off after 7 years of operation, whilst the Feasibility Study

108

provides for a two times shorter useful life) (see page 12-4,
paragraph 12.2.9).

5. The Feasibility Study does not provide for or make too low allowances
for the following taxes:

- infrastructural tax (tax deduction);
- income tax (tax deduction);

- subsoil tax (1% of the total income instead of 8.1% for copper, 5% for
gold and 8% for silver).

6. Return or payment for precious metals produced after processing of
copper concentrate on tolling terms shall be considered.

Findings

The Feasibility Study of the Development of Khandiza Multi-Metallic Ore
Field is recommended for approval with view to all remarks and suggestions
set out above with the following parameters:

1. Total cost of the project — USD 71.23 thousand:
including:
mine construction — USD 15.45 thousand;
including:
mining and transportation equipment — USD 6.19 thousand;
plant construction — USD 25.74 thousand;

administration, infrastructure and other direct costs — USD 24.89
thousand;

other costs — USD 5.15 thousand.
1] Total annual extraction and production — 650 thousand tons.
2. Estimated number of employees — 712.
3. Duration of construction — 13 months.
4. Return of borrowed funds — 29 months.” (references omitted)
184. On 25 November 2004, by letter No. 06/1017, Mr. Akhmedov, Chairman of
Goskomgeology wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister Sultanov, informing the

Ministry on the progress of the Khandiza Project as follows (Exh. C-174) (Claim.

activities by the Concessionaire under the Contract and the TEO shall
solely be the responsibility of the Concessionaire.

13.2. The Concessionaire and the Operator shall be entitled to open accounts
in banks both in national currency of the Republic of Uzbekistan and in
foreign currency within and outside the Republic of Uzbekistan in

187. Between December _2004 and February 2005, the various agencies replied to
Goskomgeology and/or to CabMin with their comments on the Bankable
Feasibility Study (Exhs. R-293, R-296, R-421, R-422, R-424, R-426-428, R-430-
431, R-513-515, R-516) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para 81; Resp. Am.Rej.

21.02.2014, paras. 121 fol.). This also gave rise to further correspondence from
Marakand (Exhs. R-429, C-568-572, C-576-580, C-582-587) (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, para. 226), in which Marakand further explained the rationale
underlying both the cash flows and the internal rate of return laid down in the
Bankable Feasibility Study and the Draft Concession Agreement. The Parties
disagree whether the reactions of the government agencies or lack thereof
constitute an approval or a rejection of the Bankable Feasibility Study.

On 3 January 2005 (mistakenly dated 2004 in the exhibit), Mr. Akhmedov on
behalf of Goskomgeology and Mr. Stuart on behalf of Marakand entered into the
Supplemental Agreement No. 7 to the PEA, in view of the expiration on 31
December 2004 of the Supplemental Agreement No. 6 (see above para. 182)
(Exh. R-24) (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 109). This Agreement
prolonged the validity of the PEA to 31 March 2005 (mistakenly dated 2004 in the
exhibit) or “if such date is earlier, till the moment of” the conclusion of a new
PEA.

On 5 February 2005, the Department Head of the Experts’ Examination of Urban
Planning Documentation issued an Expert Report which had been commissioned
by Goskomgeology (hereinafter “Uzbek State Expert Report”). In this report, the
pool of experts concluded as follows:

5. Conclusions

5.1. The feasibility study “Development of the Khandiza Polymetallic
Deposit” has been drawn up with deviations from the requirements of
the regulatory documents in effect in the republic.

Design of the underground mine, ore-processing plant, slurry pipeline
and other sections of the feasibility study require elaboration with the
participation of the O’zgeotexliti specialized institute and the republic’s
design organizations that in command of the construction regulations
and rules of the Republic of Uzbekistan, as well as special regulatory
documentation of the industry.

5.2. Considering the above, the preliminary feasibility study “Development
of the Khandiza Polymetallic Deposit” requires revision in light of the
comments of this experts’ conclusion.”

On 18 February 2005, by letter No. 3-2/7-583, the Ministry of Economy provided
observations regarding Marakand’s Draft Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, its
Draft Concession Agreement III, and its Draft Agreement on Use of a Section of
the Subsoil for Geological Study (see above para. 186) (Exh. R-296; Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 127). As concerns in particular the financial aspects of
the Draft Concession Agreement III, the Ministry of Economy commented — inter
alia — as follows:

114

“The targets forecast for concession development and sale of the finished
product under the project in the previous feasibility study do not make it
possible to draw an entirely objective conclusion. According to the previous
calculations, the net flow of monetary resources amounts to $179.2 million,
whereby only $50.7 million will be paid to the Uzbek side. Bearing in mind
the rather high internal profit rate (27.4%), after revision of the feasibility
study, the draft of the concession agreement should be clarified on the basis
of specific substantiated calculations and balance of interests of each side,
taking account of the increase in concession fee, both pegged and variable,
for the produced ore.

It then concluded its letter with the following paragraph:

“During revision of the document drafis presented, apart from those
enclosed in this letter, the comments and proposals of the Ministry of the
Economy regarding the feasibility study of the draft of "Development of the
Khandiza Polymetallic Deposit" previously sent to Goskomgeology should
also be taken into account. The question of adopting a government decision
on the concession agreement cannot be examined until the feasibility study
draft has been approved.”

191. On 28 February 2005, Marakand submitted to the Ministry of Finance an
explanation note comparing the Bankable Feasibility Study “concession fee”
economic model as suggested by Marakand in the Draft Concession Agreement
Ill, and a “full taxation” scenario, assuming that Marakand would pay no
concession fee, but rather all taxes without any exemption (Exh. C-568) (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 231). In its accompanying letter, Marakand stated as
follows:

“Marakand feels that the general review made by the various government
agencies to date may have lead to some misunderstandings as to the tax and
concession fee regime proposed in the Feasibility Study. We have attached a
background summary (refer Attachment 1) of how Marakand sees its
position and proposal. However, to allow for a proper evaluation, Marakand
seeks a working meeting with you so that a more detailed presentation and

discussion can be made.”

 

As concerns the explanation note, it stated — inter alia — as follows:

“At the present time, the source of project finance remains subject to receipt
of the proposed Decree to formally approve the Khandiza Project.
Marakand has maintained contact with several interested lenders; however
no firm involvements can be agreed until the project Decree has been
issued.”

192. On 9 March 2005, a Meeting was held between Marakand and the Ministry of
Finance, at which Marakand presented the Bankable Feasibility Study
“concession fee” economic model, the “full taxation” model and a “compromise

115

196.

economic scenario” (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 247). Marakand
followed-up on this Meeting on 10 March 2005 providing a ‘cleaner’ version of
the “concession fee” economic model. A Meeting was held between
Goskomgeology and Marakand concerning this issue on 15 March 2005, during
which Marakand reiterated its request that the Ministry of Finance issue its
conclusions on the Draft Concession Agreement. Another follow-up Meeting was
held on 22 March 2005 between Marakand and the Ministry of Finance (Exh. C-
552) (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 247).

On 23 March 2005, a Meeting was held between Marakand and the Agency for
Foreign Economic Relations regarding its comments on the Draft Concession
Agreement. Marakand provided the Agency with the requested information
regarding the cost of capital equipment on 24 March 2005 (Exh. C-588) (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 245).

On 24 March 2005, a Meeting was held between Marakand and Mr. Khasanov
(Deputy Minister of Economy), Ms Malkina (Head of the Department of
Industrial Development) and Mr. Yusupov (Director of the Center*). Following
this Meeting, Mr. Casson (Corporate Finance Manager of Marakand) sent a letter
to the Deputy Minister of Economy summarizing the concerns raised by the
Uzbek Government during the Meeting and setting out an action plan to address
these concerns (Exh. R-300).

On 29 March 2005, Mr. Casson from Marakand sent a letter to the Deputy
Minister of Economy, following-up on his action plan and providing the Ministry
with additional information (Exh. R-301). Mr. Casson concluded his letter as
follows:

“We hope this additional information clarifies the outstanding concerns of
the matters previously raised by the Ministry of Economics. We note that you
will be arranging a meeting to discuss the cut-off grade issue, together with
representatives of Goscomgeology and others, once the data has been
provided to you.

We thank you again for your comments and look forward to working with
you on finalizing technical and commercial matters.”

On 31 March 2005, the Cabinet of Ministers held a Meeting with the senior
officers of the Informational and Analytical Department for External Relations,
and representatives® of Goskomgeology, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of
Finances and the Ministry of Justice concerning the approval of the Concession.

The Protocol of the Meeting stated as follows (Exh. R-302) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 89; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 149):

“Acknowledged:

J. Comments of the Ministry of Finances and the Ministry of Economy that
the production cost calculation of Marakand Minerals Ltd in mining of
Khandiza complex deposit are not presented in due form, which
prevents drawing up an objective conclusion as to the company's
taxation; Representative of the Ministry of Finances proposed taking
into account as base of calculation similar calculation made, in
particular, by AGMC.

2. Information of the representative of the Ministry of Justice on that,
while the Law on Concessions has been adopted in 1995, the legislation
yet lacks means for its implementation.

Resolved regarding the results of meeting:

1. Goskomgeologii shall assign responsible officer within two days with
instruction to complete together with the Ministry of Finances and the
Ministry of Economy the production cost calculations (dividing by each
product name in standard form).

2. Goskomgeologii and the Ministry of Finances in cooperation with the

State Tax Committee, on the basis of complete reports and for the
benefit of the Republic of Uzbekistan, shall within one month present
the sub iated l ie
Minerals Ltd.

on the tax to Marakand

3. Ministry of Finances, Ministry of Economy, and Ministry of Justice
in cooperation with Agency of External Relations within one month
shall prepare a conclusion on the necessity to permit mining of
Khandiza complex deposit on terms of concession, and suggest the
concession fee amounts.

4. Following the results of the above issues, enter the data on the
operations performed in the Information and Analytical Department for
External Relations.” (emphasis added)

197. On 1 April 2005, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeology and Mr. Charter
on behalf of Marakand entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 8 to the
PEA, in view of the expiry on 31 March 2005 of the Supplemental Agreement
No. 7 (see above para. 188) (Exh. R-25) (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para.
209; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 172). This Agreement prolonged the
validity of the PEA to 30 June 2005 or till the conclusion of a new PEA
(whichever came earlier) and provided the following amendment to the PEA:

117

“Marakand will not claim monetary recovery as to expenses incurred during
Feasibility Study preparation and exploration works in the Territory.”

198. On 7 April 2005, a Board Meeting of Marakand was held. In view of this Board
Meeting, a “Board Paper” was prepared setting out in detail the progress of the
negotiations between Marakand/Goskomgeology and the various Ministries (Exh.
C-552).” As concerns the economic model suggested by Marakand in its
Feasibility Study, the Board Paper summarized the situation as follows:

“Project Financing matters remain largely on hold, pending finalisation of
the Concession Contract and formal Decree. No meaningful discussions can
be held with potential lenders until this important aspect has been agreed.

LJ

Marakand has submitted — by reference in the Feasibility Study — its
proposal as to the mix of concession fees and taxes it believes should be
payable. However, the general reaction by most agencies and ministries to
date has been one of caution and reservation, mainly due to the implied
“disparity” of cash to be received by Marakand (~$166M) and the Uzbek
Government (~$51M), which clearly favour Marakand. This is not
unexpected, as the type of arrangement being sought (in the form of a
Concession) is new. Traditionally, foreign investments have been made on
the basis of a joint venture or production sharing agreement. In both cases
there is a sharing of “profit” apart from whatever royalty and taxes are
agreed and there is obviously an expectation (by the Uzbek government) that
a concession contract should likewise contain some participation.

LJ

As a result of responses received, and meetings held, Marakand has had to
prepare a number of “scenarios” as to alternative financial models. Notably
this included a “full tax regime” scenario, which applied all current
(January 2005) taxes, but no concession fees. A further scenario was
requested more recently, whereby concession fees were added in order to
achieve a total net revenue split of 50/50. A third scenario developed by
Marakand was an alternative to the full tax scenario, which provided
Marakand with savings in the first five years, so as to assist meeting
potential lending ratios during the proposed loan period.

A summary of these cases is provided for the information of directors. It is to
be stressed that although these various scenarios have been provided mainly
pursuant to specific requests received, it has also been made quite clear that
the original Marakand proposal has not been amended or revised. The
additional scenarios are quite clearly for information purposes only at this
point. [Refer “4 — FS Comparison Summary”]

Financing will remain an important matter, and we will continue to be
prepared for discussions with lenders and investors alike in the coming
months. Further preliminary work on financing requirements and a
financing strategy have been initiated quite recently.”(emphasis added)

Between 11 and 28 April 2005, Mr. Casson of Marakand sent various letters to the
Agency for Foreign Economic Relations, the Ministry of Finance and of Economy
respectively, submitting a revised economic model fitting the format requested by
the authorities and requesting meetings (Exhs. C-590-592 and R-303-304) (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 248). In this model, Marakand increased the fixed
concession fee from USD 10 million to USD 10.5 million and taxes were
calculated on the basis of net (rather then gross) proceeds further to the Cabinet of
Ministers’ Decree No. 407, a decree which was issued with regard to the
establishment of another joint venture ‘Angren Gold Company’ and which
provided that royalties and taxes were to be calculated on the basis of net revenues
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 235, 250). The estimated profit of the
Project to the Republic of Uzbekistan, from royalties and taxes, was USD 66.408
million, including a USD 23.511 million concession fee (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, para. 250; Exh. R-303).

In April 2005, Nedbank issued “Indicative Term Sheets” regarding the financing
of the Khandiza Project (Exh. C-179) (Claim PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 28).

1.4 The Rupture

On 29 April 2005, the Cabinet of Ministers held a Meeting between the Deputy
Prime Minister, Mr. Sultanov, and representatives of various ministries and
agencies, including Mr. Akhmedov of Goskomgeology and Mr. Abdullayeva of
the Information and Anaysis Department of the Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet
of Ministers issued a Protocol No. 09-62-90 dated 4 May 2005 (by handwritten
annotation), summarizing the decisions made at the Meeting, according to which
the Khandiza Project was to be continued on the basis of a Joint Venture between
Uzbekistan and Marakand (Exh. C-184) (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras.
252, 317). In this regard, the Protocol provided as follows:

“By 8 May 2005, Goskomgeology (Akhmedov) should submit to the Cabinet
of Ministers the information about the results of negotiations with foreign
partner on the issue of implementation of the project on the basis of a joint
venture.”

On 4 May 2005, Mr. Abdullayeva from the Information and Analysis Department

of the Cabinet of Ministers issued a letter stating that the Uzbek Government
could accept Marakand’s concession scheme only if Marakand significantly

119

increased the concession fee from USD 23.5 million to USD 55.54 million (Exh.
R-305). This letter provided — among others — as follows:

“L.]

Previously, having reviewed the Feasibility Study for Khandiza Deposit
Development Project, Letter from Agency for Foreign Economic Relations
No. SHA-01/06-27 dated 24.01.05, a summary was concluded with the
following remarks:

LJ

Yet, in the produced documents, all the points of criticism have been
remedied, except for that of the concession fees.

LJ

According to Article 3 of the Concession Act of the Republic of Uzbekistan,
the concession business is based on the mutual benefit principle, for which
purpose the Agency for Foreign Economic Relations (AVES) recommends
the concession fees to the Republic of Uzbekistan to be estimated as follows:

LJ

Fixed payments:

1-5 years: USD 250 thousand/quarter (USD 5 million);

6-15 years: USD 125 thousand/quarter (USD 5 million);
Variable payments:

6-15 years: USD 7 per ton of the mined ore (USD 45.54 million)

Thus, the Republic of Uzbekistan will gain a revenue in the form of taxes and
concession fees in an amount of USD 100.92 million, including concession
fees in an amount of USD 55.54 million, taxes and charges amounting to
USD 45.38 million, while Marakand Minerals Company will gain a revenue
totaling USD 115.46 million, including effective cash flow of USD 64.4
million.

In view of the above and upon having accepted the AVES recommendations,
in general we consider it possible to make available for the development the
Khandiza Polymetallic Deposit under concession terms.”

203. On 5 May 2005, by letter No. 06-441, Goskomgeology informed Claimant of the
Protocol No. 09-62-90 and instructed it to prepare a joint venture proposal and
revert to the Cabinet of Ministers by 8 May 2005 (Exh. C-185) (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 152).

120

204. On 23 May 2005, a Meeting was held between Marakand and Deputy Prime
Minister Sultanov, during which Mr. Sultanov allegedly said that, if Claimant

agreed to

enter into a Joint Venture Agreement, all necessary permits and

documentation could be finalized within two months (Exh. C-187) (Claim.

Am.Reply.

23.08.2013, para. 259; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 153). In this

regard, Marakand’s Minutes of the Board Meeting of 27 May 2005 provide as
follows (Exh. R-989, para. 4):

“4.1 Noting that the Uzbek Government had recently requested the Company to

4.2

consider developing the Khandiza project as a joint venture, not a
concession, AS tabled various information setting out the status of the
concession discussions, the implications of a joint venture agreement as
opposed to a concession, and summary financial analyses of the two
approaches. RR commented that the joint venture approach appeared to
carry a lower risk profile and that, on the face of it, even at a 50%/50% joint
venture, the economic returns to the Company were not that different. AS
pointed out that the returns were similar at the metal prices assumed in the
feasibility study but that, if prices rose by more than approx 10%, the returns
escalated in favour of the Uzbek Government and against Marakand. RR
noted that, if the Government wished to participate in the upside, it would
ideally put up its own share of capital, failing which it should protect
Marakand against the downside of falling metal prices. RW pointed out that,
under the Law on Subsoil, the fact that Marakand had expended significant
sums of money exploring and evaluating the project, and that that
expenditure was acknowledged, the Company had now earned the exclusive
rights to the mining licence to develop the project.

The joint venture as an alternative option was discussed in detail. After
appropriate discussion it was agreed that the Company should respond to
the Uzbek Government in writing reaffirming the exclusive rights to develop
the project and also the fact that finance had already been raised from the
capital markets on the basis of a proposed concession agreement, but
confirming that the Company was prepared to consider the joint venture
option under certain circumstances. It was agreed that in this respect the
Government should first confirm that its share of the Charter Fund of any
joint venture would be restricted to the previously indicated historical
expenditure valued at approx $11.5 million, that the Government would be
prepared to set a tight timetable to complete the discussions, and that the
project would remain in the Foreign Investment Programme, thereby
qualifying for certain tax and other privileges. AS proposed that this
correspondence take the form of a covering letter and a Preliminary
Agreement on the Formation of a Joint Venture Company, following which,
if the Government reacted favourably, and assuming satisfactory
commercial and fiscal terms could be agreed, particularly regarding the
implications of changing metal prices, the appropriate lawyers would be
deployed to draft the definitive documentation (perhaps using Oxus’ AGF
joint venture documentation as a guideline).” (emphasis added)

121

The Parties disagree on the content of the Meeting with Mr. Sultanov and the
exact scope and meaning of his statements.

205. On 3 June 2005, Mr. Stuart, CEO of Marakand, wrote to Deputy Prime Minister
Sultanov confirming Marakand’s willingness to discuss the entering into a joint
venture in relation to the Khandiza Project along the following lines (Exh. C-187,
Exh. R-306) (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 261; Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 152-155):

“Marakand confirms it is prepared to commence discussions concerning the
economic parameters of a joint venture but notes that Decree 359 does not
foresee the execution of the project on the basis of a joint venture. Such a
change represents a material change in the legal structure of the project.
For Marakand to enter into any detailed negotiation on the basis of a joint
venture it shall be necessary that there be sufficient legal basis to hold such
negotiations.

Therefore, we propose that the parties to the project enter into a Preliminary
Agreement as per the attached draft.”

Marakand attached to its letter a draft of “Preliminary Agreement to set up a
Joint Venture” (hereinafter “Draft JV Agreement”), which provided as follows
concerning the envisaged share distribution (Exh. R-306):

“3.1 The Parties hereby agree, that their shares in the Joint Venture equity
will be determined upon consideration and agreement of the main
commercial indicators of the Project to confirm the expediency of the
Project for the Parties, foreign investors and lenders.

3.2. The amount of the Joint Venture authorised capital shall be
determined upon determination of shares of the Parties as provided by
paragraph 3.1 above subject to the appraisal of the contribution of the
State Geology Committee as set out in paragraph 3.3 below.

3.3 The State Geology Committee shall contribute USD 11,540,000 to the
authorised capital:

3.3.1 geological data and completed works related to Knandiza field;

3.3.2 license for the development of Khandiza field in the area specified
in Schedule I to this Agreement; and

3.3.3 license for geological exploration in the area specified in
Schedule 2 to this Agreement.

3.4. Marakand shall contribute to the authorised capital:

3.4.1 results of previously completed geological exploration at
Khandiza field and the Feasibility Study of the Project worth USD
8,000,000; and

122

206.

207.

208.

209.

3.4.2 cash to fill up to the share of the company in the authorised
capital of the Joint Venture.”

In Summer 2005, it seems that some South Korean investors were interested in
cooperating with Marakand on the Khandiza Project and that Marakand entered
into negotiations with them (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 96).

On 13 June 2005, Mr. Mamadaliev, a Manager at the Information and Analytical
Department of the Cabinet of Ministers, forwarded by Letter no.06/104-183 (Exh.
R-306) to the Ministries of Economy, Finance, Justice, the Agency for External
Economic Relations and Goskomgeology, Marakand’s letter of 3 June 2005 (see
above para. 205).

On 17 June 2005, AGF’s internal Audit Committee issued a report (Exh. R-164)
(hereinafter “AGF Audit Committee Report 2005”), which concluded that AGF
had breached Uzbek law relating to, among other things, (i) unauthorized and
undocumented transactions from AGF’s foreign currency account at Barclays
Bank, (ii) budget mismanagement, (iii) conclusion of interested-party transactions
without required approvals or supporting document; and (iv) inaccurate
accounting and financial reporting (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 200).

On 23 June 2005, Mr. Akhmedov of Goskomgeology sent a letter to the
Information and Analytical Department of the Cabinet of Ministers suggesting
that the JV proposal be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers subject to the
following changes to the JV parameters as proposed by Marakand in their
Preliminary JV Agreement (see above para. 205) (Exh. R-517):

“L.]

3. Article 3.1. in the version “the Parties agree that their participation
shares in the statutory fund of the Joint Venture are distributed in the
following order: 50% - Goscomgeology, 50% - Marakand”.

4. Article 3.2. in the version “On the basis of the determination of the
participation share of the Parties and taking into account preliminary
appraisal of Goscomgeology contribution to determine the Statutory
Fund in the amount 23080 thousand USD”.

5. Article 3.3. in the version “Contribution of Goscomgeology to the
statutory fund will be geology and other information obtained as a
result of carrying out of exploration works at the Khadiza deposit
estimated by preliminary data as 11540 thousand dollars.
Goscomgeology will address to Goscomimuschestvo (State Property
Committee) of the Uzbekistan Republic for approval of contribution of
the Uzbek party to the statutory fund.”

123

6. Article 3.4. in the version “Marakand” contributes to the statutory fund
information obtained during exploration works at Khandiza deposit,
preliminary feasibility study of the project, cost of which will be
confirmed by examination in the order prescribed by law of the
Republic of Uzbekistan and funds in the amount of 11540 thousand US
dollars.”

Goskomgeology also proposed the addition of new provisions, including —
among others — the following:

“Article 9.3. If the Parties do not achieve agreements on establishment of
the joint venture on the mutually acceptable conditions and work on the
project will be terminated.

9.3.1. Marakand will not claim to reimbursement of all costs incured by the
company during preparation of the feasibility study of the project and
carrying out of exploration works on the Primary agreement on
exploration dated 14 December 1996 with addendums dated 10 July
1997, dated 9 June 2000, dated 14 December 2001, dated 16 October
2003, dated 15 October 2004, 3 January 2005, 1 April 2005.

LJ

9.4. Termination of the present agreement is possible under agreement of
the Parties.

9.

Mw

If within 12 months after signing of the present Agreement the Parties
do not achieve agreements on establishment of the joint venture on the
mutually acceptable conditions and order of the Cabinet of Ministers on
the project is not adopted, Goscomgeology has the right to terminate
unilaterally the present Agreement. In this case termination will take
effect in 90 (ninety) calendar days after notification of Marakand by the
Uzbek party on termination of the agreement.”

210. On 30 June 2005, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeology and Mr. Stuart on
behalf of Marakand entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 9 to the PEA
(R-26), in view of the expiration on 30 June 2005 of the Supplemental Agreement
No. 8 (see above para. 197). This Agreement prolonged the validity of the PEA
until 30 September 2005.

211. On 4 July 2005, Mr. Yakovlev, First Deputy Chairman of the State Property
Committee, sent a letter to Goskomgeology stating that it would be “expedient” to
“take a decision after reviewing the following project documents: I. Draft of
Business Plan; 2. Draft Constituent Documents; 3. Draft of the Resolution of the
Government; 4. The relevant resolutions of the state institutions engaged in
operational procedures of the future company.” (Exh. R-969) (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 155).

124

212.

213.

On the same day, Mr. Akhemdov sent a letter to the Ministries of Economy,
Finance and Justice enclosing a draft “Cabinet of Ministers Instruction” prepared
by Mr. Akhmedov of Goskomgeology and to be signed by the Prime Minister,
Mr. Mirziyoev, authorizing the Chairman of Goskomgeology and the Chairman of
AMGK to “sign the necessary incorporation documents on behalf of the Uzbek
side and represent the interests of the state in supporting business activity of the
company with foreign investment established jointly with Marakand Minerals
Ltd.” (Exh. R-438).

On 5 July 2005, Mr. Stuart of Marakand drafted an Urgent and Confidential
Board Memorandum at the attention of Messrs Bill (William) Trew, Bill Charter,
Richard Robinson and in copy to Mr. Richard Wilkins (Exh. C-452). The purpose
of this Memorandum was to “update the Board as to the state of our negotiations
concerning the development of Khandiza and advise the Board of our intended
next steps.” As concerns the state of negotiations, Mr. Stuart expressed that their
primary objective “to secure ‘title’ to the project in moving from the concession
basis [...] to a Joint Venture basis” and their strategy to “obtain a preliminary
agreement based on certain principle terms concluded before going entering into
detailed JV discussion” had failed and that Marakand therefore needed another
“tack”. In this regard, Mr. Stuart referred to feedback received from Mr.
Akhmedoy, who spelt out the Government’s expectations as follows:

“primarily they insist on a 50-50 share split and wish to see a proposed
‘worst’ case business plan and proposed constituent documents. He
stipulated the current metal prices be used and the full taxation regime
under law applied. He went on to state this would be the ‘starting point for
discussion’ on what privileges could be justified to and granted by the
Cabinet of Ministers to make the project work.”

In this regard, Mr. Stuart commented and recommended as follows:

“In the last week we have examined multiple 50-50 JV scenarios with a
range of privileges we feel may be justified and in some cases very far
reaching. In short we cannot get the desired economic performance using FS
metal prices (which I am convinced should remain our basis) and are forced
to conclude the project is simply not good enough to share.

I have also engaged DWS to review our legal position given developments
since the listing was completed.

Currently we do not have sufficient reliable information to decide
unequivocally as to whether we should;

We take achieving an 50-50 JV agreement, with the knowledge it yields
subeconomic performance, as our primary objective for the sake of
attaining an agreement and thereafter considering what to do with it,

OR

125

We take the attaining those certain minimum economic parameters
required to fund the project as our primary objective with the
knowledge that this will be more difficult and contentious as it will
require us to pursue and try to convince the Government of that which
they have so far indicated they do not want.

Accordingly I am reluctant to formally commit Marakand one way or
another until we have a better understanding of their position.”

214. On 11 July 2005, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy sent each
a letter to the Cabinet of Ministers with their comments on Marakand’s Draft JV
Agreement (Exh. R-1374, Exh. R-519) (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 155). As
concerns the shareholder structure, these letters raised the following points:

“We believe that the Parties to the Agreement must carry out evaluation of
their contributions to the statutory fund of the joint venture in question with
the help of an independent valuation company. Besides, we think it
reasonable to provide for the contribution of the Uzbek Party into the
statutory fund of at least 50 per cent.” (Exh. R-519_2)

“The feasibility study proves the high economic efficiency of the project, but
the interests of the Uzbekistan party are not adequately represented.
Therefore, it is reasonable to combine Articles 3.1 and 3.2 into one article
and to amend to read as follows: “The authorized fund of Khandiza Mining
Company JV shall account for thousand US dollars (specify the
amount based on the data provided below) with the following structure:
Goscomgeology — 50 percent, Marakand Minerals Limited — 50 percent.
Taking into account that the portion of intangible assets in the proposed
authorized fund of the Joint Venture is rather significant, the following
issues shall be substantiated by an independent expert organization:

company’s expenses — 8 min. US dollars (Article 3.4.1) for geological
exploration and the project feasibility study;

cost of geological information and works carried out by
Goscomgeology in relation to Khandiza Ore Deposit.”

215. On 19 July 2005, by letter No. 3-2/4-1668 prepared by Ms Malkina of the
Ministry of Economy on behalf of Mrs Saidova, First Deputy Minister, the latter
wrote to the Cabinet of Ministers reporting as follows (Exh. R-308):

“Due to existence of. remarks 1 ing the submi easibilii

study, Goskomgeology was requested to work at the issue of the project
implementation on the conditions of the joint venture by the decision of the
minutes of the Cabinet of Ministers date 4.05.2005 no.09-62-90. Currently

work on preparation of statutory documents is carried out.

126

216.

218.

219.

220.

221.

Taking into account the above stated, Ministry of Economic Affairs
considers possible participation of Korean companies as one of the founders
of the established joint venture (subject to obtaining of approval of “Oxus
Resources Corporation”), or refitse of the subsidiary company of the latter —
“Marakand Minerals” from implementation of the project on the conditions
of the joint venture.”

On 21 July 2005, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeology wrote to Mrs
Saidova, First Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economy (Exh. R-439), asking
about her opinion on the draft “Cabinet of Ministers Instructions” (see above para.
212, Exh. R-438).

On_ 26 July 2005, Mr. Stuart of Marakand sent to Mr. Akhmedov of
Goskomgeology a revised draft charter, a draft shareholder’s agreement, a draft
Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, and an economic model for the proposed joint
venture based on a 15% Net Profit Ratio. In his letter, Mr. Stuart stated that
“Marakand has endeavoured to meet all your requirements and it anticipates the
documents being lodged will meet your approval.” (Exh. R-440) (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 160).

On 16 August 2005, Mr. Akhmedov of Goskomgeology responded to Mr. Stuart
and recommended various revisions to Marakand’s drafts both with regard to
Marakand’s approach to the ore deposit development system (consisting in
developing the most high-grade ores in the first 15 years, and the low-grade ores
afterwards) and the financial parameters, in particular with regard to the
anticipated expenses and interests (Exh. R-441) (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para.
162).

On 23 September 2005, Mr. Charter and Mr. Stuart of Marakand met with Deputy
Prime Minister Mr. Sultanov who — according to Claimant — confirmed that now
that the Bankable Feasibility Study had been completed and an agreement reached
on the joint venture structure, Marakand would be the developer and operator of
the Khandiza Project (Charter WS) (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 266).

On _ 30 September 2005, Mr. Akhmedov on behalf of Goskomgeology and Mr.
Charter on behalf of OML entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 10 to
the PEA (Exh. R-27) in view of the expiration of the Supplemental Agreement
No. 9 (see above para. 210). This Agreement prolonged the validity of the PEA
until 31 December 2005).

On 22 November 2005, Mr. Akhmedov of Goskomgeology sent a letter to the

Cabinet of Ministers and other concerned ministries requesting a decision on the
submitted JV draft documents as follows (Exh. C-573):

127

222.

223.

224.

225.

“[...] At the present, the drafts of the constituent documents of the JV,
economic model are prepared. It is necessary to conduct an examination of
documents of the project on the conditions of JV at the interested ministries
and agencies, to adopt the Decree of the President of the Republic of
Uzbekistan on the conditions of the implementation of the project.

In the course of discussion of the economic model of the project, the
agreements are reached as to the sharing of the cash flow on the project:
58% - Uzbek side : 42% - foreign investor. The question concerning taxation
of the joint venture remains open, it is necessary to coordinate it with the
Ministry of Finance and with the State Tax Committee.

In pursuance of the Protocol decision of the meeting at the Cabinet of
Ministers, The information and analytical Department for questions of
energy park, chemistry, metallurgy and mechanical engineering preparing
the report to the Administration of the President for the approval of the
development project of the polymetallic deposit Khandiza as a JV. After
receipt of the approval, documents on the project will be send for the
examination to the interested ministries and agencies [...]”

On 31 December 2005, the Supplemental Agreement No. 10 to the PEA expired
(see above para. 220).

On 3 March 2006, Mr. William Charter of Marakand wrote to Mr. Khasanov of
the Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Investments and Trade requesting the
latter’s assistance in the finalization of the JV documents as follows (Exh. C-186):

“May I therefore take this opportunity to ask you for your assistance in
obtaining a positive instruction from the Cabinet of Ministers in the nearest
future, so that Marakand and Goscomgeology can jointly proceed with the
finalizing and distribution of the project documentation to the relevant
ministries and governmental bodies in line with the proposed National
Investment Programme schedule.”

In April 2006, Mr. Akhmedov of Goskomgeology sent letters to Mr. Shoismatov,
Deputy Prime-Minister, urging him to make a decision on the establishment of the
envisaged Joint Venture (Exhs. R-446, R-447).

On 9 June 2006, AGF’s internal Audit Committee issued a report (Exh. R-173)
(hereinafter “AGF Audit Committee Report 2006”), according to which AGF had
violated Uzbek law relating to, among other things, (i) unauthorized and
undocumented transactions from AGF’s foreign currency account at Barclays
Bank, (ii) budget mismanagement, (iii) conclusion of interested-party transactions
without required approvals or supporting document; (iv) inaccurate accounting
and financial reporting, and (v) breach of the Presidential Decree No. UP-1504
through Oxus’ acting as an intermediary between AGF and its suppliers (Resp.

128

226.

227.

228.

SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 200, 201). The Audit Committee issued certain
recommendations, such as decreasing the loan debt to ORC by over USD 4
million, which reflected the part not supported by accounting documents and
relating also to alleged overpayments of MRT, foregoing further invoices of
MRT, requiring signatures of AGF’s General Director and its chief accountant to
effect payment on behalf of AGF, etc. (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 205).

On _ 13 June 2006, Oxus replied to AGF’s internal Audit Committee and
suggested, among others, to write off approx. USD 1 million against ORC’s loan
to AGF (Exh. R-174). According to Respondent, this response and the reply to the
other recommendations were not acceptable (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
206, Rustamova WS).

On 13 June 2006, the Cabinet of Ministers held a Meeting during which it decided
as follows with regard to the development of the Khandiza Project (Exh. R-448)
(Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 98):

“IL. On the proposed investment projects of [AMMC].:

3.1. Ministry of Justice (Mustafaev), Goscomgeology (Akhmedov), [AMMC]
(Sanakulov) shall form a working group and by June 23, 2006 present a
conclusion on the procedure of transfer of implementation of the project
"Development of polymetallic ores at Khandiza deposit" from Oxus
Resources Corporation (UK) to Almalyk MMC.”

On 15 June 2006, Ms Rustamova of Goskomgeology, presented AGF’s internal
Audit Committee’s findings and recommendations to AGF’s General Meeting of
Shareholders (Exhs. R-175/C-626). The General Meeting resolved that, by 24
June 2006, Claimant and ORC would remedy AGF’s shortfalls, and that the Audit
Committee would then re-analyze AGF’s accounts and financial reports. At this
Meeting, Goskomgeology and NMMC voted their combined 50% shareholding to
repudiate AGF’s numerous interested-party agreements and other unlawful acts,
which Claimant opposed (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 207). As concerns
the dealings with MRT, the Minutes of Meeting provide as follows:

“Besides the wages due to foreign specialists in the Republic, fees for
consulting services were paid through the company Mining Resources Trust
(MRT) under contract dated 1.01.03 No. 03/MRT/01. During the period from
2003 to April 2006 the total amount of the bills presented for payment under
the contract run up to 7646,8 thousand US dollars, with the contract value of
2 million US dollars.

The amount of 2955,6 thousand US dollars should be uncharged, and 2691,2
thousand US dollars returned by the Oxus Resources Corporation to the
settlement account of the AGF JV. The said contract comes under the
category of deals in which the members of the Supervisory Board (J. Kipps

129

and W. Trew) on the part of Oxus and AGF Board of directors are
interested. According to article 1 0.1.1 (par.) of the AGF Charter the
conclusion of this contract was subject to approval by the General meeting
of the AGF Shareholders.

J. Kipps reported that though he had signed the contract on behalf of MRT,
neither he nor any other member of the Supervisory Board for Oxus had any
financial interest in the MRT business. R. Wilkins noted that, taking into
consideration all of the above points, in the AGF JV letter dated June 13th,
2006, in reply to the Audit Commission's 18 comments, Oxus did agree to
write off the amount of 959395 US dollars from the credit provided by the
Oxus Resources Corporation.”

229. On 26 June 2006, Goskomgeology* informed William Charter of Marakand of the

230.

231.

Cabinet of Ministers’ decision to assign the Khandiza Project to AGMK (Exhs.
C-198, C-199) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para 99).

In June and July 2006, Marakand repeatedly protested against a transfer of the
Khandiza Project to AGMK (Exhs. C-432, C-433, C-188).

On _1 August 2006, a Board Meeting of the Directors of Marakand was held
during which it was decided to proceed as follows regarding the potential transfer
of the Khandiza Project to AGMK (Exh. C-198):

“AS [Alaistar Stuart] reminded the meeting that to date no formal resolution
or decree altering anything in respect of Khandiza had been received by the
Company and indeed what, if anything, does come out may indeed be a very
pleasant surprise! DWS have advised waiting for an official document
before taking any action w.r.t. announcements.

RR [Richard Robinson] proposed the purported ‘decision’ may i) be a
genuine one based on a social and economic set of criteria, ii) flying a kite
by some dark forces iii) part of an instruction to 'soften' [Marakand] for the
introduction of another party. AS commented it may too be linked the Oxus
Group problems in Kyrgyzstan. Formal communications should also include
reference to historical verbal ‘instructions’ to put those too on the record.

The Board acknowledged all forms of discrediting tactics are most likely to
be forthcoming as part of a campaign to justify the purported ‘decision'.”

232. On 3 August 2006, Mr. Gorlov, Deputy Chairman of Goskomgeology, sent a

letter to the Cabinet of Ministers addressing the question of ORC’s costs in the
works conducted on the Khandiza Deposit (Exh. C-732). It provided in particular
as follows:

The specific sender of this letter is not identified therein.

130

“Given that by way of CabMin Decree No. 359 Oxus Resources Corporation
was granted exclusive rights in the project, Goskomgeology proposed that
the draft Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan “On
measures of expedition of the commencement of exploitation of Khandiza
and Uch-Kulach polymetallic deposits” includes a_ provision on
establishment of a working group from the representatives of relevant
ministries and State organs to determine the amount of de facto expenses
born by Oxus Resources Corporation and Marakand Minerals Ltd.
regarding the Khandiza deposit.

After the receipt of the message on the development of the project by AMMC
alone, without participation of the foreign investor, Oxus Resources
Corporation orally proposed to exclude this clause from the draft
Presidential Decree mentioned above. It believes that the inclusion of such a
clause and compensation of expenses will close any paths for the company to
any form of participation in the project. The company hopes to continue
negotiations on the project afier it has been transferred to AMMC’s
balance.”

233. On 10 August 2006, Respondent issued a Presidential Decree No. PP-442 ‘On the
Effective Utilization of Mineral and Raw Materials of Polymetallic Ores of the
Khandiza and Uch-Kulach polymetallic deposits’ (Exh. C-200), which provided
for the construction of a mining and processing complex on the basis of the
resources of the Khandiza and Uch-Kulach polymetallic deposits. The Decree
cancelled Decree 359 and ordered Goskomgeology to transfer within ten days the
mineral resources to AMGK.

234. On 20 November 2006, by Decree No. 527-F, the Cabinet of Ministers approved
AGMK’s Preliminary Feasibility Study to develop the Khandiza and Uch-Kulach
deposits, which allowed AMGK to begin production in 2010 (Exh. R-102) (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 100-101).

2

The Khandiza Claim in a Nutshell

235. The Khandiza claim is composed of two sub-claims:

(i)

(ii)

Claim regarding the development of the Khandiza Deposit (see below
section 2.1); and

Claim regarding the exploration of the Southeast Uzbekistan Exploration
Area (“Expanded Area’) (see below section 2.2).

131

2.1 Claim Regarding the Development of the Khandiza Deposit

2.1.1 Claimant’s Position

236.

237.

238.

Claimant claims that, based on the Primary Exploration Agreement (PEA), the
Decree No. 359 and other documents and actions of the Uzbek Government and
in view of the successful completion of the Phase | Feasibility Study, Claimant
secured the exclusive right to explore and develop the Khandiza Deposit through a
concession agreement.

According to Claimant, the condition precedent to development rights in
Khandiza was a positive outcome of the Phase | Study, and not the successful
negotiation of the terms under which the Deposit was then to be developed
(Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 31). To the extent that Claimant undisputedly
successfully completed the Phase | Feasibility Study, it secured development
rights in Khandiza and Respondent had the duty to negotiate such agreement in
good faith (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 29). Alternatively, at the very least,
Claimant had the legitimate expectation that it would be granted such
development right.

However, according to Claimant, Respondent breached its obligations by first
taking Claimant’s right to develop the Deposit via a concession agreement by
issuing Protocol Decision No. 09-62-90 on 29 April 2005 instructing Claimant to
enter into a joint venture with the State for the development of the mine, whereby
Claimant lost 50% of the Project. Respondent then went on to fully expropriate
Claimant’s right to develop the mine by awarding the Project to AGMK by
Presidential Decree No. PP-442 of 16 August 2006 (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 228; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 38 fol.). In addition, the way in
which Respondent proceeded was in breach of its obligation of cooperation, good
faith, due process and transparency, by unilaterally and abruptly taking Claimant’s
rights without notice or warning (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 43).

2.1.2 Respondent’s Position

239.

According to Respondent, Claimant’s claims turn largely on a false factual
predicate, i.e., that Claimant had a legal right to develop the Khandiza Deposit
beyond what the parties had specifically agreed. According to Respondent,
Claimant had limited exploration rights that were valid for five years. The right to
develop the Khandiza Deposit was conditioned by the submission by Claimant of
a mutually beneficial proposal which would need to be approved by the various
governmental authorities (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 45, 381; Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 82, 100). Claimant’s right to develop the Deposit thus

132

240.

241.

242.

remained contingent on the approval by the Cabinet of Ministers of its Feasibility
Study. This approval was never obtained because Claimant’s proposal was not
‘mutually beneficial’ and therefore unacceptable (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para.
12; Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 2 fol.). As such, Claimant did not secure the
rights it pretends to have been deprived of.

Under the PEA, Claimant bore the risk of failing to develop a mutually acceptable
and commercially viable plan. Goskomgeology worked with Claimant for nearly a
decade, but despite several extensions of time Claimant never found a new viable
deposit or proposed a mutually acceptable agreement to develop Khandiza. Thus,
in accordance with the PEA, Claimant is solely responsible for the cost of its
failed exploration works.

2.2 Claim Regarding the Exploration of the Expanded Area

According to Claimant, under the PEA, Claimant was given the exclusive right to
explore an area of 12,000 km? surrounding the Khandiza Deposit (the so-called
Southeast Uzbekistan Exploration Area, also referred to as ‘Expanded area’). The
scope of this area was reduced twice: A first time by Supplementary Agreement
No. 2 to the PEA of 9 June 2000, by which the area was reduced by half, i.e. to
5,259 km*; A second time, by Supplemental Agreement No. 6 to the PEA of 15
October 2004, whereby it was reduced to from 5,259 km’ to 1,199.5 km’.

It is undisputed that the first reduction was contemplated by the PEA and
therefore unproblematic; the Parties however disagree on the appropriateness and
legality of the second reduction.

2.2.1 Claimant’s Position

243.

244.

Claimant claims that the second reduction operated by the Supplemental
Agreement No. 6 was unjustified and deprived it of part of its exploration rights,
hence constituting an expropriation as it did not serve a public purpose related to
the internal needs of Uzbekistan on a non-discriminatory basis (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, para. 356).

It also constituted a breach, by Respondent, of its specific undertakings towards
Claimant and, by the same token, a breach of Respondent’s international
obligations under Article 2(2) in fine of the BIT or by virtue of umbrella clauses
in other treaties applicable via the most favoured nation clause of the UK-
Uzbekistan BIT (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 357).

133

245.

By depriving Claimant of its exploration rights, Respondent also breached its
obligation to afford Claimant fair and equitable treatment, as it failed to honor
Claimant’s legitimate expectation that the area that it was authorized to explore
would not be reduced to less than half of it, and as it coerced Claimant into
accepting a reduction of the Expanded Area. In so doing, Respondent also
violated its obligation not to take measures that were unreasonable and not to
impair Claimant’s exploration rights or violate Claimant’s right to FPS (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 358-359).

2.2.2 Respondent’s Position

246.

According to Respondent, Claimant’s claims turn largely on a false factual
predicate, i.e., that Claimant had a legal right to explore parts of the Expanded
Area beyond what the parties had specifically agreed. The PEA granted ORC
exploration rights only from 14 December 1996 to 14 December 2001.
Goskomgeology repeatedly agreed in good faith to extend the duration of the
PEA. Thus, the Supplemental Agreement No. 6 did not take anything from ORC
or Marakand, as neither ORC nor Marakand had exploration rights at that time to
be taken. On the contrary, Goskomgeology permitted Marakand to continue
exploration works when its rights otherwise were set to expire in accordance with
the terms of the PEA and Supplemental Agreements No. | through No. 5. As
such, the reduction contemplated in Supplemental Agreement No. 6 cannot be
deemed as a ‘taking’ of anything from Claimant.

2.3 With Regard to the Quantum

2.3.1 Claimant’s Position

247.

With regard to the claim concerning the development of the Khandiza Deposit,
Claimant claims a loss of profit as a result of its expropriation of the development
rights and/or other breaches of the BIT as follows (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
para. 414):

Primary claim: USD 588.7 million based on full expropriation and with
valuation date per date of the Arbitral Award, provisionally set at 30 June 2012;

1“ alternative: USD 307.6 million based on expropriation of only 50% with
valuation date per date of the Arbitral Award, provisionally set at 30 June 2012;

134

248

249.

2.3.

250

251.

e 2" alternative: USD 146.1 million based on concession agreement and valuation
date on the date of expropriation of 10 August 2006, with interests until 30 June
2012;

¢ 3” alternative: USD 72.1 million based on JV contract and valuation date on the
date of expropriation of 10 August 2006;

e 4" alternative: USD 9 million as restitution of the amount invested by Claimant
plus 5% as of 10 August 2006.

. Claimant rejects Respondent’s criticism concerning its damages calculation.
According to Claimant, its valuation of the Khandiza Deposit is in no way
speculative but rather based on very reliable data, including the Bankable
Feasibility Study, that amply satisfy the “reasonable probability” threshold for the
purpose of quantification (see above para. 0) (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras.
14 fol.).

With regard to the claim concerning the exploration of the Expanded Area,
Claimant claims a loss of profit as a result of its deprivation of exploration rights
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 417 fol.):

e USD 200 million, i.e. the loss sustained as a result of the taking of Claimant’s
development rights in the Khandiza Deposit divided by three.

2 Respondent’s Position

. According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to establish that Respondent
violated any provision of the BIT in connection with either the Khandiza Deposit
or the exploration of the Expanded Area. Absent a treaty breach, Claimant is not
entitled to any compensation (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 243).

Even assuming for the sake of argument that a breach of the BIT occurred,
Claimant still is not entitled to the compensation claimed because its alleged
losses are inherently speculative and unreliable, as Claimant projects purported
damages relating to lost profits on the basis of rights that it never held and
operations that never took place (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 243, 247 fol.):

135

252

253.

254.

(i) As a matter of law, Claimant bears the burden of proving the damages it
seeks and no reparation for speculative or uncertain damages can be
awarded. There are no exceptional circumstances justifying to deviate
from this principle, and in particular the conditions set out in Al-Bahoul
v. Tajikistan and other cases that Claimant refers to, neither apply nor are
fulfilled in the present case.

(ii) Claimant’s damages theories rely on fundamentally flawed assumptions
(namely that Claimant had the right to develop the Khandiza Deposit),
data (namely the Bankable Feasibility Study, which is not sufficient) and
accounting methods (namely with regard to the discount rate and date of
valuation).

. As concerns Claimant’s alternative claim for reimbursement of its sunk costs,
Claimant effected a waiver as to reimbursement under the PEA and Supplemental
Agreement No. 8, and therefore is not entitled to compensation in that regard
either (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 244, 266 fol.).

In addition, even assuming that Claimant would be entitled to some award of
costs, Claimant’s calculations of its alleged sunk costs are inconsistent throughout
the Reply and its own documents. Moreover, Marakand’s internal documents
suggest that many of Claimant’s alleged expenses related to the Khandiza Project
were for self-interested payments to related companies. Claimant thus has failed
to provide a reliable breakdown of costs incurred for exploration activities and the
preparation of feasibility studies, and its documents suggest that a significant
portion of its expenses were instead incurred for payments to its own executives
and for its listing on the AIM (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 268 et fol.).

2.4 The Key Issues

In view of the Parties’ positions, the Arbitral Tribunal considers the following
questions to be key in assessing Claimant’s claims over the Khandiza Project:

(1) What was the nature and scope of Claimant’s rights in the Khandiza Project as
arising out of the PEA, Decree No. 359 and other instruments and
communications from the Uzbek Government? What were the conditions, if any,
of such right? And were these conditions fulfilled ?

(2) Did Respondent deprive Claimant of such rights in a way which is contrary to its
obligations under the BIT?

136

In particular:
o Did Respondent expropriate such right?

o Did Respondent breach the FET standard or any other standard under
Article 2 of the BIT by breaching legitimate expectations of Claimant?

o Do Respondent’s actions otherwise amount to a breach of the Full
Protection and Security ?

o Do Respondent’s actions amount to a breach of the umbrella clause ?

(3) If Respondent breached its obligations under the BIT, is Claimant entitled to
damages, and if so, to what extent?

255. The Arbitral Tribunal will examine issues (1) and (2) first as concerns the claims
relating to the Khandiza Deposit (3.2) and, second, for those relating to the
Expanded Area (3.3). The Arbitral Tribunal will address issue 3 only if necessary.

3. With Regard to the Claims Relating to the Khandiza Deposit

3.1 Issue No. 1: The Scope of Claimant’s Rights in the Khandiza Deposit

3.1.1 The Parties’ Positions °
3.1.1.1 Claimant's Position

256. According to Claimant, it was granted in 1996 the exclusive right to explore the
Khandiza Deposit and to thereafter develop the mine, provided that the results of
its Phase 1 Study be positive. It was the completion of the positive Phase 1 Study,
upon exploration and confirmation of the Deposit’s potential that gave rise to
Claimant’s right to develop the Deposit. Claimant’s right did not depend on the
conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement for the development of the mine, to
be subsequently negotiated. In other words, it is Claimant’s position that the
completion of a Phase 1 Study directly conferred upon Claimant the right to
develop the Deposit under terms that the Parties thereafter had the obligation to
negotiate in good faith. Furthermore, Claimant’s contractual right to develop the
mine was in accord with the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan “on Subsoil”

arguments which the Tribunal considers most relevant to determine the issue at stake.

dated 23 September 1994 (hereinafter “Law on Subsoil”) and matched its
legitimate expectation, under international law, to develop the Deposit that it had
de-risked at its own risk and costs (Exh. C-263; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
para 104; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 31 fol.). The requirement that the
Parties’ agreement be mutually acceptable did not mean that the Parties had to
agree to some sort of equal split of profits. Rather, it implied that the terms of the
agreement were to benefit both Parties. The split naturally would be affected by
the fact that the risks were not distributed equally (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
paras. 154, 225 fol.).

More specifically, Claimant relies — among others — on the following main
instruments as follows:

(i) The PEA of December 1996 granted ORC full and exclusive rights to
carry out exploration of Khandiza and the surrounding 12,000 km? (the
so-called Southeast Uzbekistan Exploration Area), and tasked ORC with
the preparation of a Preliminary Feasibility Study (also referred to as the
“Phase 1 Study”) (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 147);

(ii) The Supplemental Agreement No. 1 to the PEA of 10 July 1997
consolidated ORC s exclusive rights in that it cancelled
Goskomgeology’s right to enter into a Joint Venture Agreement with a
third party and opt out of the agreement with ORC within three years
from the signing of the PEA (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 157);

(iii) The Letter of Intent of 29 January 2000, in which ORC and
Goskomgeology agreed to engage in negotiations towards an agreement
for the development of the mine in view of the conclusive results with
respect to the viability of the Deposit. This Letter of Intent superseded
the PEA and the Supplemental Agreement No. | to the PEA (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 175, 208, 218 fol., 303).

(iv) | Through Decree No. 359 of 17 October 2002, the Cabinet of Ministers
granted ORC the “exclusive right to develop the Khandiza Polymetallic
Project’ with regard to the relevant territory, and Claimant did not
merely secure negotiation rights. The only thing left to be determined
was the concrete form of cooperation (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
paras. 177-178);

(v) The Supplemental Agreement No. 5 to the PEA of 16 October 2003
further confirmed Claimant’s “exclusive rights to develop the Property”
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 179, 209) and indicated that the

Parties were in negotiation for a concession agreement or production

138

259.

260.

sharing agreement, but not for a Joint Venture Agreement. This would be
further confirmed by various subsequent correspondence (Exhs. C-556 to
C-561, C-174);

(vi) | The Supplemental Agreement No. 6 to the PEA of 15 October 2004
formalized Goskomgeology’s agreement to the concession route in
relation to Khandiza, based on the provision of Decree No. 359 for a
duration of five years (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 187, 209);

(vii) Various intra-State correspondence of Uzbekistan (including Exhs. C-
174, R-295, R-438, R-308, R-439, R-446, R-447, C-556 to C-566);

(viii) The Uzbek Expert Report of 5 February 2005 (Exh. R-515);

Based thereon, Claimant contends that it was eventually granted an exclusive right
to develop the Khandiza Deposit through a concession agreement.

3.1.1.2 Respondent's Position

As already mentioned above (paras. 250 fol.), in general, Respondent contends
that Claimant’s claims turn largely on a false factual predicate, i.e., that Claimant
had a legal right to develop the Khandiza Deposit beyond what the parties had
specifically agreed. According to Respondent, Claimant had limited exploration
rights that were valid for five years. The right to develop the Khandiza Deposit
was conditioned by the submission by Claimant of a mutually beneficial proposal
which would need to be approved by the various governmental authorities.
Claimant’s right to develop the Deposit thus remained contingent on the approval
by the Cabinet of Ministers of its Bankable Feasibility Study (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 381, Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 123 fol.).

More specifically, Respondent answers Claimant’s contentions mainly as follows:

(i) The purpose of the PEA was to establish the initial framework for
Claimant to prepare a Feasibility Study regarding the development of
Khandiza, for Claimant to study the geology of the area immediately
surrounding the Deposit, and for Claimant to explore the Expanded Area.
Goskomgeology thus granted Claimant the exclusive right to carry out
certain exploration works, as well as access to all of its maps and prior
works, whereas Claimant undertook to finance and to prepare a
Preliminary Feasibility Study no later than 31 December 1997 and to
finance geological analyses of the expanded surrounding area. Under the
PEA, Claimant bore the risk of failing to develop a mutually acceptable
and commercially viable plan (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 62

139

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

fol.; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 166 fol.). The PEA originally
contemplated a joint venture with a split of 50/50 ratio, thus envisioning
an equitable allocation of any profits (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
60).

At the time of the Supplemental Agreement No. | to the PEA of 10 July
1997, Claimant had performed only preliminary works, and had not yet
completed its Phase | Feasibility Study. Thus, Claimant’s contentions are
wrong and this amendment did not mean that Goskomgeology was
somehow bound to enter into a Joint Venture Agreement with Claimant.
The purpose of entering into Supplemental Agreement No. | was to
reaffirm Claimant’s obligation to obtain the approval of the Cabinet of
Ministers regarding the main economic and technical parameters of its
proposal before it would obtain any development rights (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 87).

The Letter of Intent of 29 January 2000 did not supersede the PEA,
which remained in force. In addition, following the conclusion of this
Letter of Intent, Claimant “knew the economic terms that it had to meet
in order to develop the project on the basis of a concession” (Akhmedov-
WS 09.02.2013, para. 5) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 75; Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 97, 117 fol.);

As concerns Decree No. 359, the changes made in the final version of
this Decree compared to the draft Decree prepared by Claimant and
Goskomgeology, and in particular Articles 2 and 3, show that the
securing of development rights were still subject to Claimant being able
to develop a Bankable Feasibility Study for the Government’s review in
accordance with the procedure established by Uzbek law, and that
Claimant’s rights in the Project still depended on the results of such
Feasibility Study. Decree No. 359 is only the first of two Decrees needed
entitling Claimant to engage in direct negotiations regarding the
provisions of a concession agreement. The other Decree would be
necessary to approve the concession agreement itself (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 100 fol.);

The Supplemental Agreement No. 5 to the PEA clearly confirms the
necessity of completing a Feasibility Study and getting the approval of
the Cabinet of Ministers before an appropriate agreement could be signed
(Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 104);

The Supplemental Agreement No. 6 to the PEA was valid only until 31
December 2004 or the conclusion of a new PEA. In addition, this

140

261.

Agreement expressly referred to the need to obtain a further Decree for
ORC to be granted any concession and therefore, as the other ones,
confirms that Claimant needed the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers
to obtain a concession and secure the right to develop the Khandiza
Deposit (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 104);

(vii) Various internal documents of Claimant, correspondence of
ORC/Marakand as well as Marakand’s public listing documents show
that Claimant was very much aware that its rights in Khandiza were
limited to those specifically agreed upon and did not extend to an
unconditional right to develop Khandiza based on a concession
agreement (e.g., Exhs. R-98, R-293, R-421, R-513, R-424, R-426, R-428,
C-452, R-515, R-296, R-430, R-431, R-1142, R-516, R-305, R-300)
(Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 15 fol.).

Based thereon, Respondent contends that because Claimant was never able to
provide the Cabinet of Ministers with an acceptable Bankable Feasibility Study, it
never secured any rights to develop the Khandiza Deposit.

3.1.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

262.

263.

264.

3.1.2.1.The Problem

Based on Article 1 of the PEA, Claimant secured “exclusive rights to carry out
exploration” as well as thereto related accessory rights to information and to set
up relevant infrastructure.

The PEA did not, and this is undisputed in the Parties’ latest submissions, grant
Claimant direct and unconditional development rights, although the Parties
disagree on the conditions for the obtention of such right (see in particular Reply,
para. 152, where Claimant refers to “terms and conditions that were to be
negotiated”, see also Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 31)

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s understanding, the PEA instituted a three steps system:

(1) The first step contemplated by the PEA was the completion of a
Preliminary Feasibility Study, i.e. “Phase 1 Study”.

(2) If such study was to be positive, the PEA then contemplated as the
second step the negotiation of a “Joint Venture Agreement”, which was
contemplated as a 50%/50% Joint Venture and the primary purpose of which
was to develop a full Bankable Feasibility Study.

141

(3) The third step would then consist in the development of the Deposit
based on the commercial model developed in the Fully Bankable Feasibility
Study.

265. It is undisputed between the Parties that the first step, ie. the completion of a
Preliminary Feasibility Study, was successfully completed (see above para. 151).
The dispute concerns the further two steps, and in particular whether their
completion was necessary for Claimant to secure the development right and, if so,
whether the Parties’ behavior in the completion of these steps actually led to a
“secured” right of development of Claimant. In other words, the Arbitral Tribunal
shall examine the rights arising out of the original agreement and to what extent,
if at all, these rights were subsequently modified.

3.1.2.2 The Original Agreement Contemplated in the PEA

266. The PEA and its Annexes provide as follows regarding the nature and scope of
Claimant’s rights in the Khandiza Deposit:

- Article 1 of the PEA, dealing with the objectives of the PEA, provides
that:

 

“the purpose of this Agreement is to develop the initial framework of a
feasibility study of the Khandiza Polymetallic Deposit [...] and to carry out
the exploration works”;

- Article 2 of the PEA, dealing with the ‘Results of Works’, provides that:

“In the event of positive outcome of Phase 1 Study, the Parties will initiate
the negotiations on a Joint Venture Agreement under mutually acceptable
[conditions] for the Parties. The objective of such a Joint Venture shall be
to complete a full bankable feasibility study and commercial development of
economically viable deposits within the territory of the Property.

In the event of negative outcome of Phase I Study, Oxus shall not claim for
any reimbursement of costs incurred in the process of developing the
feasibility study and will be obligated to cede back to Goskomgeologia all
geological materials previously obtained therefrom.” (emphasis added)

- Article 3 of the PEA, dealing with the duration of the PEA, provides that:

“after completion of the Phase I Study, [Oxus] will enter into formal
negotiations with Goscomgeologia to create a Joint Venture pertaining to
the Property, or it shall cede the Property back to Goscomgeologia, should

142

267.

268.

269.

270.

271.

such an arrangement for a Joint Venture Agreement be not achieved.”
(emphasis added)

- Annex 4 to the PEA, dealing with the commercial terms and capital
structure of the Joint Venture, provides that “the Parties agree that during
the preparation of the full bankable study, and prior to construction of the
venture, the Charter Fund shall be split to 50 : 50 percent ratio.”

Thus, under the PEA, Claimant was granted exclusive exploration rights as well
as, in case of a positive Preliminary Feasibility Study, the right to enter into
negotiations for a 50/50 Joint Venture Agreement in view of preparing a full
Bankable Feasibility Study and develop the Deposit in a commercial viable way
on mutually acceptable terms.

In conclusion, at the time of the execution of the PEA, there was no unconditional
or “secured” right of Claimant to exclusively develop the Khandiza Deposit.

The question is thus whether this right was modified later on so as to procure
Claimant with an exclusive right to develop the Khandiza Deposit based on a
concession agreement, as claimed by Claimant.

3.1.2.3 Did Subsequent Agreements Modify the Nature of Claimant's Rights ?

The Arbitral Tribunal shall examine whether any of the subsequent contractual
agreements and/or decrees issued by Uzbekistan relied upon by Claimant were
such as to modify the nature of Claimant’s original right under the PEA and
transform it into a “secured” right to develop the Khandiza Deposit.

As concerns the Supplemental Agreement No. 1 to the PEA (see above para.
143), the Arbitral Tribunal does not find that it substantially modified the nature
of Claimant’s rights under the PEA. The modifications made to the PEA by this
Supplemental Agreement merely specified the right to negotiate a mutually
acceptable Joint Venture Agreement and further stressed the necessity of
obtaining approval from the relevant government authorities as follows:

- Article 2 of the PEA was modified to refer expressly to “good-faith,
exclusive, formal negotiations on a Joint Venture Agreement and, subject
to the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, [...] under terms mutually
acceptable to the Parties.”

- Article 3(ii) of the PEA was modified to refer expressly to Oxus’ right to
“negotiate on a formal, exclusive and good faith basis and, subject to

approval by the Cabinet of Ministers.”

143

272.

273.

274.

275.

276.

277.

The Supplemental Agreement No. | to the PEA of 10 July 1997 nonetheless
consolidated Claimant’s right to exclusivity, by confirming the prohibition for
Goskomgeology to enter into negotiations for a Joint Venture Agreement with
third parties. However, it did not transform Claimant’s right into an unconditional
or “secured” right to development of the Khandiza Deposit.

As a consequence, when Claimant submitted on 31 December 1997 the “WGM
Phase | Feasibility Study” (see above para. 152, Exh. C-159, see Transcripts of 30
April 2014, 614:7 — 614:11 [Mr. Akhemdov’s cross-examination]) and thereby
reached a “positive outcome” in the sense of Art. 1 para. 1 of the PEA, it secured
the right to enter into “formal, exclusive and good faith negotiations” with
Goskomgeology for a 50/50 Joint Venture Agreement under mutually acceptable
terms.

As concerns the Letter of Intent of January 2000 (see above para. 163), it
provides that OML and Goskomgeology agreed “to prepare a draft Concession
Agreement” under the terms as listed in the Letter to be approved by the Uzbek
Government. While Claimant contends that this Letter of Intent superseded the
PEA (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 208), i.e. presumably in changing
Claimant’s right to negotiate a Joint Venture Agreement into a right to negotiate a
concession agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal finds no basis for such argument.

The events preceding the conclusion of the Letter of Intent show that it was
Claimant who, in or around summer 1998 (see above para. 154), first suggested
the concession scheme instead of a Joint Venture Agreement. It appears that
Goskomgeology was willing to enter into such talks notwithstanding the fact that
Uzbek law was not very developed as concerns the granting of concessions (Exh.
R-268). Thus, from 1998 to 2000, talks were held between ORC and
Goskomgeology as to the pros and cons of the two schemes and various
discussions were held with the Uzbek Government to develop a mutually
acceptable concession system. In this regard, it should be stressed that Claimant
itself changed its position several times, suggesting first a concession scheme (see
above para. 153; Exh. R-911), then going back in September 1998 to a proposed
joint venture scheme (see above para. 154; Exh. R-269) and finally, in November
1998, reverting to a concession scheme (see above para. 156; Exh. R-270).

In conclusion, under these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider
that the Letter of Intent is of a nature to supersede the clear terms of the PEA. This
is all the more the case that no mention of this Letter of Intent was ever made in
any of the subsequent Supplemental Agreements to the PEA.

The question thus is whether and to what extent Claimant secured direct
development rights through Decree No. 359 of 17 October 2002.

144

278.

279.

280.

281.

282.

As concerns Decree No. 359, (see above para. 176), it expressly provides that
“the Cabinet of Ministers hereby [...] [g]rants Oxus Resources Corporation the
exclusive right to develop the Khandiza Polymetallic Project (Surkhandariskaya
Region).” It therefore undeniably refers to “development rights” and not merely
to “exploration rights”. However, this sentence has to be read in its broader
context, both taking into account the ongoing negotiations between the Parties and
the other provisions of the Decree No. 359.

At the time of the adoption of Decree No. 359, Marakand and Goskomgeology
were deeply engaged in negotiations regarding the specific terms of a concession
agreement, whereby they had already provided the Uzbek Government with two
draft concession agreements and drafts of relevant decrees (see above para. 166
and 170). As such, it was not contested that Claimant had delivered a positive
Phase | Feasibility Study and that it was in principle entitled to develop the
Khandiza Deposit. The key issue was the finalization of the formal agreement
regarding the specific terms and conditions of such commercial development and
the economic benefits for Marakand, Goskomgeology and the Uzbek State, which
would be further subject to the approval by the Uzbek Government.

This is further confirmed by the other provisions of the Decree No. 359, in which
the Uzbek Government “authorized” Goskomgeology “to sign an agreement with
ORC for the preparation of a Feasibility Study in respect of the Khandiza
Polymetallic Project” and further provided that “depending on the results of the
such feasibility study, [ORC] shall have the exclusive right to conduct
negotiations for determining the concrete form of cooperation for the development
of the Project (concession agreement or production sharing agreement), as well as
the financing and other conditions for the development of the Project” (see above
para. 175).

In conclusion, Decree No. 359 entitled ORC and Goskomgeology to proceed with
step No. 2 under the PEA, i.e., the signing of an agreement to prepare a full
bankable study. Decree No. 359 makes it sufficiently clear that neither the final
form of the cooperation between ORC and Goskomgeology (concession
agreement or production sharing agreement) nor the “final financing and other
conditions for the development” had been finally agreed upon. As such, it did not
provide Claimant with an unconditional right to develop the Khandiza Deposit
based on a concession agreement.

As concerns the Supplemental Agreements No. 5 and No. 6, the Arbitral

Tribunal further does not consider that these agreements granted Claimant any
farther-reaching rights than those already granted under Decree No. 359.

145

(i) The Supplemental Agreement No. 5 of 16 October 2003 (see above para.
177) refers to the Decree No. 359 and its wording regarding the granting
of “exclusive rights to develop the Property”, but at the same time
specifies that ORC “shall have the exclusive rights to hold negotiations
to develop the Property by way of a concession agreement or a
production sharing agreement”, thereby showing that the securing of the
exclusive development rights depended on the outcome of the
negotiations;

(ii) The Supplemental Agreement No. 6 of 15 October 2004 (see above para.
182) expressly mentions that “the Parties acknowledge that a further
Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan shall be
required in order to grant the concession under such a Concession
Contract.”

283. As such, for Claimant to have secured definitive rights to develop the Khandiza
Deposit, it would have been necessary to complete the third step contemplated
under the PEA (see above para. 264), i.e. the conclusion of a final agreement with
Goskomgeology over the commercial and financial terms of their cooperation and
its approval by the Cabinet of Ministers. For this to happen, Claimant needed to
get the approval by the Cabinet of Ministers of its Bankable Feasibility Study,
which was submitted on 11 October 2004 (see above para. 0). Thus, by the time
ORC entered into the Supplemental Agreement No. 6, it knew and acknowledged
that it still required the approval of the Bankable Feasibilty Study.

284. As concerns the various intra-state correspondence referred to by Claimant
(see above para. 257 (vii)), the same conclusion derives from their analysis:

(60) Mr. Akhmedov’s letter to Deputy Prime Minister Sultanov of 25
November 2004 (see above para. 184) expressly refers to the “draft” nature
of the envisaged concession agreement and decree and to the necessity to
“submit them to the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan for review and
consideration.” (Exh C-174);

(ii) Mr. Akhmedov’s letter to Mr. Eshmuratov, Khokim of the
Surkhandarya Region (Exh. R-295), provided that “[o]n November
30,2004, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan, U. T.
Sultanov, instructed all the interested ministries and agencies to agree and
adopt a joint decision as to the industrial development of the Khandiza
field by February 1, 2005”, thereby referring to the ongoing approval
process. Although the tone of the letter seemed to assume that the
Concession Agreement would be approved, the letter cannot be read as a

146

replacement of an approval that had to come from the Cabinet of
Ministers.

(iii) As concerns the draft Cabinet of Ministers Instruction suggested
by Mr. Akhmedov on 5 July 2005 (see above para. 212), it is unclear
whether this instruction sheet was ever signed by the Prime Minister (Exh
438 is an unsigned version). In any event, the Arbitral Tribunal considers
that this instruction was a mere government internal instruction allowing
Mr. Akhmedov to sign relevant documents for the set-up of the Joint
Venture. Thus, this letter and the attached instruction dealt with the
representation powers of Mr. Akhmedov and cannot be considered to be a
substitute for the required approval of the final Joint Venture Agreement
by the Cabinet of Ministers.

(iv) Mrs Saidova’s letter of 19 July 2005 to the Cabinet of Ministers
(see above para. 215) refers to “substantial remarks regarding the
submitted feasibility study” and therefore considered the possibility to
enter into the JV with Korean companies or simply refuse to continue the
Project with Marakand. This letter therefore further indicates that the deal
between ORC and Goskomgeology was not sealed and no rights had been
definitely secured by ORC.

(v) Mr. Akhmedov’s letters to Mrs Saidova, Deputy Prime Minister,
of October 2004 (Exhs. C-556 to C-566), of 21 July 2005 (see above para.
216, Exh. R-439) and of 14 April 2006 to Mr. Shoismatov, subsequent
Deputy Prime Minister (see above para. 224; Exhs. R-446 and R-447)
show that Goskomgeology took an active role in liaising with relevant
Ministries and Officials to push for responses and approval of the draft
decrees and/or agreements. However, this correspondence further confirms
that further steps, in particular approval, were outstanding and that no
formal rights had yet been secured by ORC.

285. The fact that negotiations regarding the final form and conditions for a joint
development of the Khandiza Deposit were ongoing is further shown by the
correspondence and other government documents referred to by Respondent,
including for example R-98, R-293, R-296, R-300, R-305, R-421, R-424, R-426,
R-428, R-430, R-431, R-513, R-515, R-516, R-1142. Some of this
correspondence clearly stressed that certain terms of the proposed agreements and
decrees were not acceptable to some Ministries, and based thereon, Claimant
could not assume that it had formally secured the right to implement the
Concession or Joint Venture scheme as proposed.

147

286.

287.

288.

Finally, it appears that Claimant was very well aware that (i) its rights to develop
the Khandiza Deposit were subject to further approval by the Government and
that (ii) the proposed Concession and Joint Venture schemes were not
uncontroversial and gave rise to various objections from various Ministries. This
is clearly evidenced by the statements made by Mr. Alasdair Stuart in the Urgent
and Confidential Board Memorandum of 5 July 2005 (see above para. 213),
reporting to Mr. Bill (William) Trew, Bill Charter, Richard Robinson and Richard
Wilkins, stating, among others, that the “Decree 359 is very clear on our
‘exclusive’ rights to ‘negotiate’ a deal on Khandiza (as a Concession or PSA) but
does not state we have exclusive rights to the project per say. (sic) One may
argue the exclusive negotiation rights do not exist for negotiating a JV deal
(which is why the idea of a Preliminary Agreement on a JV was conceived —
currently abandoned).” (emphasis added)

3.1.2.4 Conclusion

In conclusion, Claimant did not secure an unconditional right to develop Khandiza
through a concession agreement, but only a right to formal, exclusive and good
faith negotiations to develop the Khandiza Deposit jointly with the Uzbek Parties
on mutually acceptable terms, primarily on the basis of a 50/50 Joint Venture.

3.2 Issue No. 2: Did Uzbekistan Deprive Claimant of Such Rights in a Way
Which is Contrary to its Obligations under the BIT?

Claimant raises various claims of breach of the BIT by Respondent, which will be
dealt with separately in the following order:

(i) Claimant’s Claim for Expropriation under Article 5(1) BIT (see below
section 0);

(ii) Claimant’s Claim for Breach of Article 2 of the BIT, including the breach
of the FET standard and the claim resulting from arbitrary and
unreasonable measures (see below section 0);

(iii) Claimant’s Claim for Breach of the standard of Full Security and
Protection (“FPS standard”) under Article 2 of the BIT (see below section
0);

(iv) Claimant’s Claim for Breach of the umbrella clause of Article 2(2) in fine
of the BIT (see below section 0).

Claimant’s Claim for Expropriation Under Article 5(1) BIT

3.2.1.1 The Parties’ Positions

(a) Claimant’s Position

According to Claimant, (i) Khandiza is a textbook case of unlawful expropriation
by the host State of the rights and investment of Claimant; (ii) Uzbekistan carried
out this expropriation after Claimant had spent considerable human and financial
resources as well as expertise to de-risk the Deposit and had secured development
rights, in accordance with industry standards, agreement terms, and international
law; (iii) Uzbekistan did so unapologetically, without justification, and without
ever suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of Claimant; and (iv) Uzbekistan did
not offer any compensation for this taking (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para.
95). According to Claimant, this expropriation happened in two steps:

(i) Respondent first took Claimant’s vested right to develop the Deposit via
a concession agreement, by instructing Claimant to enter into a joint
venture with the State for the development of the mine. This happened on
4 May 2005 by CabMin Protocol Decision No. 09-62-90, which reduced
Claimant’s rights to Khandiza area to 50% by ordering a 50/50% JV with
Goskomgeology (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 209, 591; Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 253, 258, 308, 334; Exh. C-184).

(ii) Respondent then went on to fully expropriate Claimant’s right to develop
the mine by awarding the Project to a State-owned entity. This happened
on 10 August 2006 by Presidential Decree No. PP-442, which assigned
the Khandiza Project to AMGK (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 228,
229, 232, 597, 598; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 213, 308; Exh.
C-200).

This expropriation did not satisfy the conditions of Article 5(1) of the BIT and
was therefore unlawful: it did not serve a public purpose and no compensation
was offered to Claimant (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 474 fol.).

In any event, even if Respondent’s defense that Claimant never acquired the right
to develop the Deposit were to be upheld, Claimant alternatively submits that it
did, at the very least, have the exclusive right to good faith negotiations for these
rights. If the conclusion of such negotiations constituted a condition precedent to
Claimant acquiring development rights, the fact that Respondent prevented its
materialization also amounts to an expropriation of Claimant’s rights and
investment (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 292; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014,
paras. 18, 53 fol.).

149

292.

293.

294.

295.

Finally, even assuming that none of Claimant’s proposals were mutually
acceptable, Respondent failed to comply with its obligations when it abruptly
broke off the negotiations, without any warning or explanation and awarded the
Project to AMGK (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 319, 321).

(b) Respondent’s Position

According to Respondent, Claimant never had the particular investments that it
now alleges were taken by Respondent (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 184
fol.). Claimant’s rights in the Khandiza Project consisted only of the right to (1)
carry out exploration works to search for a new, undiscovered deposit in the
region surrounding the Khandiza Deposit, i.e. the Expanded Area, (2) to develop a
Preliminary Feasibility Study regarding the possible development of the Khandiza
Deposit (referred to in the PEA as “Property”), and (3) to initiate negotiations, in
the event that the results of its Preliminary Feasibility Study were positive,
regarding the establishment of a Joint Venture under terms that were mutually
acceptable to Claimant and the State (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 83). In
order to obtain the right to develop, Claimant would need to demonstrate to the
Government both the economic and technical viability of its proposal and the
commercial benefits for the Government of entering into such a partnership. It
arises out of the various Prospectuses and Annual Reports of Marakand and ORC,
that they were well aware that their rights were limited to a right to negotiate and
what requirements were needed to be fulfilled to conclude an agreement with the
State (Exhs. C-154, C-150, R-915, C-452) Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 189).
However, Claimant refused to address the issues raised by the State in particular
with regard to (i) the inequitable division of profits, (ii) the preferential tax
treatment afforded to Marakand in deviation from Uzbek law, (iii) the
underutilization of mineral resources, and (iv) the technical and environmental
concerns (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 198).

As to Claimant’s theory of expropriation of a right to good-faith negotiation,
Claimant has failed to identify any authority that supports its position that the
mere absence of good faith negotiations can alone rise to the level of an
expropriation (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 195). According to Respondent,
who relies on Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, “there cannot be an expropriation
unless the complainant demonstrates the existence of proprietary rights in the first
place” and a right to good-faith negotiation does not constitute such proprietary
right (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 8 fol.; Exh. RL-240). In any event, in case
bad faith would have been ascertained, the factual evidence demonstrates that
Marakand — not Respondent — would have failed to negotiate in good faith.

Given the absence of any actual investment to expropriate, or any expropriatory
act, Claimant’s expropriation claim must be dismissed (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 184, 202).

150

3.2.1.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

(a) The Applicable Legal Basis

296. Article 5 of the BIT provides as follows (Exh. CL-20):

“ARTICLE 5

Expropriation

(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall

(2

not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect
equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to
as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other Contracting Party
except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party
on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and
effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the genuine
value of the investment expropriated immediately before the
expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public
knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal
commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay,
be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The national or
company affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting
Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other
independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the
valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set
out in this paragraph.

Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which
is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its
own territory, and in which nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of
paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to
guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of
their investment to such nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.”

297. As such, Article 5(1) provides for expropriation under the following terms and

conditions:

0)

expropriation, or any measure having equivalent effect, must be

justified by a public purpose;

(ii)

it must be effected on a non-discriminatory basis;

151

298.

299.

300.

301.

(iii) it must be accompanied by adequate compensation to be
calculated based on the “value of the investment expropriated
immediately before the expropriation”, including interests;

(iv) such compensation must be effected “without delay”;

(v) the expropriation or the valuation of the compensation shall be
subject to judicial review.

The situation of an expropriation of “assets” of a company which is constituted
under the law of Uzbekistan, i.e. Marakand, is expressly contemplated in para.
2 of Article 5, which further provides that the foreign shareholder of such
company, i.e. Claimant, shall be entitled to the same treatment as described in
para. 1 as concerns the loss of value of its investment in such company.

(b) The Relevancy of Article 5 in the Present Case

The Arbitral Tribunal has already found that Claimant did not secure an
unconditional right to develop the Khandiza Deposit through a concession
agreement, but only a right to formal, exclusive and good faith negotiations to
develop the Khandiza Deposit on an exclusive basis jointly with the Uzbek Parties
on mutually acceptable terms, primarily on the basis of a 50/50 Joint Venture (see
above para. 287).

It is undisputed that negotiations took place and that they were unsuccessful, and
that the development of the Khandiza Deposit was ultimately assigned to AMGK
instead of Marakand. As a result thereof, and blaming Respondent for the failure
of the negotiations, Claimant claims that is has been expropriated of its right of
development.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimant’s reasoning puts on an equal
footing the duty to conduct negotiations according to a certain standard and the
success of such negotiations. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, these are however
rights of a distinct nature.

The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that a right to formal negotiations cannot
be subject to an “expropriation” in the sense of Article 5 of the BIT, because it
lacks the nature of proprietary right, i.e. of “asset” in the sense of Article 5(2) of
the BIT. Finding otherwise by following Claimant’s reasoning would lead to
assuming that the State had an obligation to conclude an agreement at specific
conditions. This would contradict the relevant contractual provisions, which
emphasized aspects such as a “negotiation” and “mutually acceptable terms”.
Finding that a right to mere formal negotiations could be subject to expropriation
in the sense of Article 5 of the BIT would lead to transforming an obligation to do

152

302.

303.

304.

3.2.2

305.

306.

something according to certain standards (i.e. “une obligation de moyens”) into an
obligation to achieve a certain result (i.e. “une obligation de résultat”). This
cannot be the purpose or meaning of Article 5 of the BIT.

That however does not mean that the failure to achieve a positive outcome of the
negotiations could not give rise to a breach of the BIT, depending on the
circumstances and causes for such failure, namely if such failure is imputable to
the State. The Arbitral Tribunal however considers that such a scenario would fall
under the scope of application of Article 2 of the BIT, and not under Article 5 of
the BIT.

3.2.1.3 Conclusion

Claimant’s Khandiza Claims No. 1 and No. 3, to the extent they are based on an
allegation of expropriation under Article 5 of the BIT, are rejected.

The facts underlying this claim shall however be taken into consideration when
153avourabl a potential breach of Article 2 of the BIT.

Claimant’s Claim for Breach of Article 2 of the BIT

3.2.2.1 The Parties’ Positions

(a) Claimant’s Position

As concerns Article 2 of the BIT, Claimant raises two different claims based on
(i) a breach of the FET standard of Article 2(2) of the BIT, and (ii) a breach of
Respondent’s obligation to refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable measures under
Article 2(2) of the BIT.

As concerns the FET standard, Claimant contends that Respondent breached
such standard in that the taking of Claimant’s right to develop the Khandiza
Deposit was unfair and inequitable. The FET standard of Article 2(2) of the BIT
imposes on Respondent an obligation to act consistently and transparently, to
honor the investor’s legitimate expectations, to refrain from exercising coercion,
to act in good faith, and to refrain from acting arbitrarily, grossly unfairly,
unjustly, idiosyncratically, discriminatorily, or without observing due process
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 330; Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 501-
558). Respondent breached these obligations by (i) ordering that Claimant
abandon the concession route and make a proposal for a 50/50 Joint Venture
Agreement, (ii) by thereafter abruptly ending the negotiations and issuing
Presidential Decree No. 09-62-90 awarding the Project to AMGK and thereby

153

307.

308.

309.

breaching Claimant’s legitimate expectations and further failing to observe due
process (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 329 fol; Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,
PSEG Global v. Turkey, ADC Affiliate Limited v. Hungary ). In addition,
Respondent failed to ever clearly state its expectations or the terms it would agree
to or to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for Claimant’s draft
proposals (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 343; Metalclad v. Mexico, Exh.
CL-93).

As concerns the obligation to refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable
154avourabl, Claimant contends that Respondent’s inconsistent behaviour was
unreasonable considering that Respondent had agreed to, and even encouraged
Claimant’s investments in the Khandiza Deposit and Claimant’s completion of a
Bankable Feasibility Study, that Claimant had addressed in detail all of
Respondent’s questions regarding technical and financial aspects of Claimant’s
Draft Concession Agreement, and that Claimant had even agreed, thereafter, to
enter into a 50/50 Joint Venture Agreement for the development of the mine
despite the loss that this entailed. Under these circumstances Respondent’s
inconsistent, unreasonable and arbitrary behaviour violates Article 2 of the BIT
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 350).

(b) Respondent’s Position

According to Respondent, Claimant’s claims are unfounded as all of its Khandiza
related claims turn on alleged undertaking and assurances that Respondent never
gave (Resp. Rej, para. 236).

As concerns Claimant’s FET claim, it is primarly based on an assertion that
Claimant had certain legitimate expectations, which were ultimately unduly
deceived by Respondent. However, a claim based on legitimate expectations must
proceed from the exact identification of the origin of the expectations alleged.
Claimant has not identified any such specific assurances or commitments with
respect to the Khandiza site — beyond those affording ORC the undisputed right to
negotiate a possible deal to develop the Deposit. In addition, the PEA provided
ORC merely with a right to negotiate an economically viable plan for Khandiza
that was mutually beneficial to both parties and subject to requisite State
approvals. Accordingly, Claimant could have no legitimate expectation to a
purported development right that it, in fact, acknowledged did not exist.
Accordingly, Respondent did not violate any purported legitimate expectations of
Claimant in connection with its non-existent rights to develop the Khandiza
Deposit or to explore certain parts of the Expanded Area beyond what the parties
had agreed (Resp. Rej, paras. 214 fol.).

154

310. As to Claimant’s allegation that Respondent violated the FET standard because its

311.

conduct in the Khandiza negotiations was “procedurally flawed, as Respondent
did not observe due process”, it is unfounded. ORC and Marakand were afforded
ample due process, but chose to squander the opportunity through unreasonable
proposals and bad faith negotiations (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 221; Resp.
PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 16). Claimant merely complains of the outcome that
naturally followed from their own negotiating positions and tactics. In fact, the
Government was active, responsive and straightforward in detailing its
expectations, while first ORC then Marakand repeatedly made untimely and
unresponsive proposals without regard for the feedback that they received (Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para 226). Marakand’s internal documents show that
Marakand was well aware of — yet unwilling to address — the Government’s
concerns. The due process component of the FET standard does not require a
State to pursue endless process, nor to continue to entertain fruitless negotiations
that are leading nowhere (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 224 fol.).

As concerns Claimant’s claim based on arbitrary or unreasonable measures,
Claimant already conceded in its Statement of Claim that the unreasonable and
arbitrary factors that it reads under Article 2(2) of the BIT are subsumed under the
fair and equitable treatment standard, also under Article 2. Thus, these are not two
different standards. As a consequence, since Claimant’s FET claim must be
rejected, the claim for unreasonable or arbitrary measures shares the same fate
(Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 233).

3.2.2.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

(a) The Applicable Legal Basis

312. The relevant part of Article 2 of the BIT provides as follows:

“(1) Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create 15Savourable
conditions for nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to
invest in its territory, and, subject to its right to exercise powers
conferred by its laws, shall admit such capital.

(2) Investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall
at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy
full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting
Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures the | management,
maintenance, use enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of
nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. Each
Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party. [...]”

316.

317.

The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider it necessary to enter into a lengthy
analysis of the concept and scope of the FET standard in general. It will simply
acknowledge that there is a great variation in the way this standard is applied by
international tribunals, partly because of the different approaches towards the
origins and nature of the FET standard (e.g. whether conceived as an international
minimum standard or as an autonomous standard) (for a summary of the situation,
see El Paso v. Argentina, paras. 330 fol.), partly because the relevant provisions
contemplating the FET standards in BITs differ in their structure and wording,
thereby requiring a case by case analysis and application. However, as stated in El
Paso v. Argentina (para. 348), the legitimate expectation of the investors have
generally been considered central in the definition of the FET standard, whatever
its scope. The Arbitral Tribunal further agrees with the tribunal in E/ Paso v.
Argentina, that the concept of “legitimate expectations” is an objective concept,
that is the result of interests and rights of both the investor and the State, and that
the result of such balancing may thus vary according to the specific context (El
Paso v. Argentina, paras. 356 fol.).

Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal will focus its analysis on the scope of the FET
standard based on Article 2(2) of the BIT and its delimitation with other standards
mentioned in this provision, before determining whether Respondent breached
any of Claimant’s legitimate expectations as protected under any of these
standards.

(aa) The Scope of the FET Standard Under Article 2(2) of the BIT

Article 2(2) of the BIT is drafted in very general terms and, with respect to the
FET standard, merely states that “each Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment.” There is no definition of the FET
standard.

According to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a treaty is to be
interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to
the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.”

The object and purpose of the BIT is set out as follows in the Preamble (Exh. CL-
20):

“The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan;

Desiring to create favourable conditions for greater investment by nationals
and companies of one State in the territory of the other State;

156

318.

319.

eo

320.

321.

Recognising that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under

 

international of such ii will be ducive to the
stimulation of individual business initiative and will increase prosperity in
both States;””

Considering the lack of specific definition in the BIT, the FET standard as
contemplated by Article 2(2) must be understood as a means to guarantee justice
to foreign investors, and when doing so, for the States’ actions to give due regard
to an investor’s legitimate expectations by refraining from taking measures which
are not justified under the circumstances, i.e. unreasonable, disproportionate or
discriminatory.

(ab) The Relationship Between the FET Standard and the Other Standards
Provided for in Article 2(2) of the BIT

Article 2(2) of the BIT refers, in addition to the FET standard, to three other
duties of the States, (i) the duty to ensure full protection and security (“FPS
standard”), (ii) the duty to refrain from impairing “by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use enjoyment or
disposal of investments” and (iii) the duty to “observe any obligation it may have
entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party” (so-called “umbrella clause”).

As concerns the FPS standard and the umbrella clause, the specific scope of these
standards and their relation with the FET standard is disputed. Therefore, the
Arbitral Tribunal will examine these two standards and their alleged violation
separately.

As concerns the duty to refrain from unreasonable or discriminatory measures,
although Claimant deals with its violation separately, Claimant has conceded in its
Statement of Claim that “the standard of reasonabless does not have a different
meaning from the fair and equitable treatment standard ‘with which it is
associated” (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 551 quoting the Saluka v. Czech
Republic case) and that the standard of protection against arbitrariness
(presumably included in the standard of reasonableness) “is related” to that of fair
and equitable treatment, in that “any measure that might involve arbitrariness or
discrimination is in itself contrary to fair and equitable treatment.” (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 552 quoting the CMS v. Argentina case). Actually, in certain
parts of its submissions, Claimant even presents the obligation not to engage in
conduct that is “arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or
lacking due process” as the “sixth element” of the FET standard (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 535).

157

322.

323.

324.

325.

326.

327.

As such, Claimant does not claim that a breach of the duty to refrain from
unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory measures is an independent standard
form the FET and constitute a separate basis for Claimant’s claims. In addition,
the factual basis on which Claimant’s relies to argue that Respondent resorted to
arbitrary and unreasonable measures is not different from the factual basis
underlying its claim for a breach of FET (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras.
348-350).

As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the duty to refrain from
unreasonable or discriminatory measures as provided in Article 2(2) of the BIT is
subsumed under the broader FET standard and that a 158avourabl which is
unreasonable or discriminatory in the sense of Article 2(2) would at the same time
constitute a breach of the FET standard. This is not to say that both standards are
fully equivalent, in particular — as explained above (para. 318) — the FET standard
may have a broader scope than the more specific duties to act in a reasonable and
non-discriminatory way.

(b) The Relevancy of the FET Standard in the Present Case

When applying the FET standard of Article 2(2) of the BIT to the Khandiza
Project, it is of particular relevance that Claimant had successfully completed the
first step contemplated in the PEA, i.e. the Preliminary Feasibility Study. In
addition, both Parties engaged into the second step, i.e., the negotiation of a
formal agreement.

Under these circumstances, although Claimant had no specific right to a particular
result as concerns the final form and terms of cooperation, Claimant had a
legitimate expectation that it would be granted the right to develop the Khandiza
Deposit, provided it would be able to finalize the terms of cooperation with the
Uzbek Parties and the State under mutually acceptable terms. With regard to this
second step, Claimant was entitled to expect that Respondent would act in good
faith, according to the law. However, as mentioned in the Maffezini v. Spain case,
a BIT is not an insurance policy against bad business judgments, or for that
matter, unprofitable business (see Maffezini v. Spain, para. 64).

The question thus is whether Respondent breached these legitimate expectations
by otherwise acting in a way contrary to the FET standard.

Claimant’s reproaches towards Respondent can be summarized as follows (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 329 fol.):

158

328.

329.

330.

331.

(i) Respondent’s Protocol Decision No. 09-62-90 by which it ordered
Claimant to abandon the concession route and make a proposal for a
50/50 Joint Venture Agreement and its later Decree No PP.-442 by
which it awarded the development of the Khandiza Deposit to AMGK
breached the FET standard in that it was substantively adverse to
Claimant’s legitimate expectations to develop the Khandiza Deposit by
way of a concession agreement;

(ii) By failing to negotiate in good faith the terms of a concession agreement
under which the Khandiza Deposit would be developed, Respondent
breached its obligation of good faith under the FET standard;

(iii) | By abruptly ending the negotiations and issuing Presidential Decree No.
09-62-90 awarding the Project to AMGK, Respondent failed to observe
due process and thereby breached the FET standard.

Claimant’s claim for breach of FET standard seems to have a ‘substantive’ and a
‘procedural’ component. On one side, Claimant claims about the result, i.e. having
been deprived of its legitimate expectation to be granted the right to develop the
Khandiza Deposit (i.e. ‘substantive component’). On the other side, Claimant
further complains about the way in which Respondent behaved during the
negotiation process (i.e. ‘procedural component’).

The Arbitral Tribunal will analyse both components separately:

(ba) As Concerns the Substantive Component of Claimant’s FET Claim

To the extent that Claimant complains about the result, i.e. not having been
granted the final right to develop the Khandiza Deposit under the terms of a
concession put forward by Claimant, it must be stressed that — as stated above —
Claimant cannot be deemed to have had a legitimate expectation to a particular
result of the negotiation process. Claimant only had a legitimate expectation to be
granted the exclusive development right to the Khandiza Deposit under “mutually
acceptable terms.” Under these circumstances, the mere failure to achieve an
agreement could only constitute a breach of the FET standard if Claimant
established that Respondent refused without justifiable reason a proposal which
should have been considered as “mutually acceptable” in view of all the relevant
circumstances of the case.

Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal will examine whether (i) Respondent’s decision
through Protocol Decision No. 09-62-90, to “abandon” the concession route,
and/or (ii) its later Decree No. PP-442 to allocate the Khandiza Project to AMGK

159

332.

333.

334.

335.

336.

were in breach of the FET standard in that they unduly rejected proposals from
Claimant which were to be deemed “mutually acceptable.”

As concerns the concession scheme, this scheme was proposed by Claimant
knowing that the Uzbek Government was not experienced in the granting of
concessions and its implementation would require an amendment of the Uzbek
legal framework in place (see above para. 155; Exh R-269). As such, Claimant
took the risk of not being able to convince the Uzbek Government of the
attractiveness and feasibility of this scheme and/or to convince it to introduce the
necessary legal changes.

It is further established that the concession scheme was eventually rejected by the
Uzbek Government ultimately because of a failure of the Parties to agree on an
appropriate concession fee (see above para. 202; Exh. R-305). The Uzbek
Government made it sufficiently clear that the reasons for such rejection was that
the financial terms contemplated by Claimant under the draft concession
agreements were not acceptable. Marakand’s Board Memorandum of 7 April
2005 clearly shows that Marakand was aware of the concerns of the Uzbek
Government regarding the “disparity of cash” of the concession scheme “to be
received by Marakand (~$166M) and the Uzbek Government (~$51M), which
clearly favour Marakand.” According to the Board Memorandum, these concerns
of the Uzbek Government were “not unexpected, as the type of arrangement being
sought (in the form of a Concession) is new.” (see above para. 198; Exh. C-552).

Under these circumstances, it is not the Arbitral Tribunal’s role to review in detail
the economic attractiveness of Claimant’s proposal as one would do when judging
the due performance of contractual obligations. For the purpose of assessing a
potential breach of the FET standard under Article 2 of the BIT, the key question
is whether such rejection was a violation of the standard.

Based on the evidence at hand, and in particular Marakand’s awareness of the
risks of the concession scheme and the thereunder disadvantageous cash position
for the Uzbek Government, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Uzbek
Government’s refusal to approve the proposed concession scheme and its
instruction through Protocol No. 09-62-90 to revert to a negotiation of a Joint
Venture Agreement cannot be deemed to constitute a violation of the FET
standard.

As concerns the proposed Joint Venture terms, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the
PEA originally contemplated a Joint Venture with a 50%/50% split of the Charter
Fund (see above paras. 140 and 287). Thus, Claimant’s argument that the terms
“mutually acceptable” did not necessarily amount to a 50%/50% split is irrelevant.

160

337.

338.

339.

340.

341.

The question is rather whether Respondent insisted on such a split in a manner
contrary to the FET standard thereby preventing the possibility of any agreement.

The Arbitral Tribunal finds that there is no factual basis to come to such
conclusion.

The Uzbek Government made it sufficiently clear that it did not consider the
capital distribution proposed by Claimant in its draft Joint Venture Agreement as
sufficiently mutually beneficial (see above para. 214). This was clear to
Marakand, as evidenced by the Urgent and Confidential Board Memorandum of 5
July 2005 (see above para. 213; Exh. C-452), in which Mr. Stuart expressly stated
that “[i]Jn short we cannot get the desired economic performance using
[Feasibility Study] metal prices (which I am convinced should remain our basis)
and are forced to conclude the project is simply not good enough to share” and
that based on this statement he considered that there were two strategic options for
Marakand: (i) agreeing to a 50%/50% split knowing that it would “yield
subeconomic performance”, or (ii) insisting on the Marakand’s proposal, which
“will be more difficult and contentions as it will require [Marakand] to pursue and
try to convince the Government of that which they have so far indicated they do
not want.”

Marakand decided to insist on what they believed to be the more beneficial
scheme for Claimant. This was a strategic decision taken on the basis of a clear
understanding of the Government’s concerns. The risk identified by Marakand,
ie. that it would fail to convince the Uzbek Government of the “mutually
beneficial” character of their envisaged Joint Venture scheme, simply
16lavourablel61d. Claimant failed to establish that the Uzbek Government’s
criticism towards the sharing of the economic benefits of the Project as
contemplated by Marakand was not based on reasonable concerns.

Under these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to conclude that the Uzbek
Government’s eventual refusal to approve a Joint Venture Agreement on such
basis and its decision through Decree No. PP-442 to assign the Khandiza Project
to AMGK were per se contrary to the FET standard.

(bb) As Concerns the Procedural Component of Claimant's FET Claim

To the extent that Claimant complains about the procedure, i.e. Respondent’s
failure to participate in good faith and its allegedely abrupt interruption of the
negotiation process, these allegations could — if established — constitute a breach
of the FET standard. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore needs to examine whether
Respondent’s lacked good faith or otherwise unduly undermined or interrupted
the negotiation process.

342. It arises out of the record that there were extensive negotiations between
Claimant, Goskomgeology and various departments of the Uzbek Government as
concerns the form of cooperation to develop the Khandiza Deposit. In addition, it
arises from the record that Goskomgeology and the relevant Uzbek Government
departments were open to discuss also avenues not originally contemplated under
the PEA, i.e. the concession agreement, and provided feedback to Claimant and/or
Goskomgeology regarding Claimant’s proposals.

343. In particular, the record shows the following:

0)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

Goskomgeology supported the Joint Venture project, subject to certain
amendments to the scheme proposed by Claimant, and liaised with the
Uzbek Government to have it approved (see e.g. above paras. 221 (Exh.
C-573) and 224 (Exhs. R-446, R-447);

Various entities and departments of the Uzbek Government provided
feedback on the draft Joint Venture Agreement. This feedback showed
that various government departments took issues with various aspects of
the scheme proposed by Claimant, in particular (i) the financial aspects
of the shareholding and cost and profit shares, which were not considered
to be sufficiently “mutually acceptable” and (ii) the technical and
economic aspects of the envisaged development activities, which were
not considered to be appropriate in view of the characteristics of the
Khandiza Deposit and the surrounding environment and infrastructure
(see e.g. above paras. 190, 194, 196 (Exhs. R-296, R-300 and R-302) as
concerns the concession scheme, and paras. 202 and 214 (Exhs. R-1374,
R-519, R-305, R-308) as concerns the JV scheme);

Claimant was largely aware of these concerns, as documented in the
Urgent and Confidential Board Memorandum of 5 July 2005 (Exh. C-
452, see above para. 338);

The negotiations with the Uzbek Government lasted from the summer
1998 until winter 2005, i.e. over 7 years, during which Goskomgeology
extended the duration of the PEA Agreement seven times for a total of
four years, i.e. from 31 December 2001 to 31 December 2005 (see above
paras. 173, 177, 182, 188, 197, 210, 220);

344. Based thereon, Claimant’s contentions that the Uzbek Government acted in bad
faith or ‘abruptly ended’ the negotiations with Claimant are unfounded. It may
very well be that due to the number of government entities involved and
communication issues relating to the language and existing tensions between
Goskomgeology and Marakand (in view of the problems incurred in the AGF

162

348.

Project, see below para. 467), Claimant was not kept informed of every single
correspondence from or concern raised by the Uzbek Government and that there
was lack of efficiency and maybe even inconsistencies in the feedback received.
However, all in all, Claimant was aware of the concerns of the Government and
made certain strategic choices in deciding how to address them.

It further arises from the record that the Uzbek Government’s decision to assign
the Project to AMGK was not an ‘abrupt’ one, but was first discussed by the
Cabinet of Ministers on 13 June 2006 (i.e. 5 years after the original expiry date of
the PEA, see above para. 227) and formalized only on 10 August 2006, i.e. over
two months later during which Marakand tried to reverse the course of this
decision but without success (see above paras. 230 and 231).

Under these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that, based on the factual
context as arising out of the evidence at hand, the way in which the Uzbek
Government managed the negotiation process with Goskomgeology and/or
Marakand does not reach the threshold of a breach of the FET standard.

3.2.2.3 Conclusion

Claimant’s Khandiza Claim No. 1, to the extent it is based on an alleged breach of
the FET standard and/or arbitrary and unreasonable treatment under Article 2(1)
of the BIT, is rejected.

Claimant’s Claim for Breach of the Standard of Full Security and
Protection (“FPS Standard”) Under Article 2(2) of the BIT

3.2.3.1 The Parties’ Positions

(a) Claimant’s Position

According to Claimant, the acts and omissions of Respondent, namely the
revocation through Protocol Decision No. 09-62-09 of the right to develop the
mine by way of concession and then the revocation through Decree No. PP-442 of
Claimant’s development rights altogether and the attribution of the same to
AMGK were also substantively and procedurally constitutive of a violation of
Claimant’s right to Full Security and Protection, hence a violation of Article 2(2)
of the BIT (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 559 fol.; Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, paras. 351 fol.).

163

(b) Respondent's Position

349. According to Respondent, Article 2(2) of the BIT is meant “to protect more

350.

351.

35

2.

ow

specifically the physical integrity of an investment against interference by use of
force” and not other forms of impairment to an investment (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 460; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 239). Claimant has not
alleged any form of interference with the physical integrity of its alleged
investment at the Khandiza site, by a third party or otherwise. On this basis alone,
Claimant’s full protection and security claim fails.

3.2.3.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings
(a) The Applicable Legal Basis
The relevant part of Article 2 of the BIT provides as follows:

“(1) Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create 164avourable
conditions for nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to
invest in its territory, and, subject to its right to exercise powers
conferred by its laws, shall admit such capital.

(2) Investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall at
all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full
protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.
[...].” (emphasis added).

As for the FET standard, Article 2 of the BIT does not provide a specific
definition of the FPS standard and uses a very broad and general wording.

The question thus arises whether, in this context, the FPS standard is really
different from the FET standard, and if so, to what extent.

. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal once again agrees with the tribunal in E7 Paso

v. Argentina, according to which the FPS standard “is no more than the traditional
obligation to protect aliens under international customary law and that it is a
residual obligation provided for those cases in which the acts challenged may not
in themselves be attributed to the Government, but to a third party” (para. 522). In
other words, unless otherwise expressly defined in a specific BIT, the general FPS
standard complements the FET standard by providing protection towards acts of
third parties, i.e. non-state parties, which are not covered by the FET standard.
Thus, where an incriminated act is done by a State-organ, the applicable standard
is the FET standard, whereas where such act is done by a non-state entity, the
applicable standard becomes the FPS standard. As concerns the content of the FPS
standard, case-law and commentators generally agree that it includes an

164

354.

355.

an

“obligation of vigilance and due diligence”, which in turn comprises a duty of
prevention and a duty of repression (see e.g. TecnicosMedioanbientales Tecmed v.
Mexico, para. 177 ; El Paso v. Argentina, paras. 522-523 ; Pantechniki v. Albania,
paras. 77 and 81. The question thus arises whether the “obligation of vigilance and
due diligence” of the FPS standard is of the same nature and scope as the
obligations arising out of the FET standard, i.e. whether the FPS standard
prescribes to ensure investors “fair and equitable” treatment by non-state entities.
It seems obvious that a State is not in a position to ensure the level of commitment
with regard to the conduct of non-state entities, including commercial entities
which are State-owned but operated independently according to commercial law
and practice, compared with the conduct of its own organs. As such, under the FPS
standard, an investor may not expect a State to ensure that the investor be treated
“fairly and equitably” by any third party, but instead the investor has the right to
expect that the State takes reasonable measures within its power to prevent
wrongful injuries by third parties, and where such injuries have already happened,
to punish them. This is why the FPS standard is often referred to and applied in the
context of “use of force” (see e.g. Saluka v. Czech Republic, para. 26 A; Wena
Hotels v. Egypt, para. 84; Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic, para. 203; see also
Enron v. Argentina, para. 286 and Sempra v. Argentina, para. 323).

The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Respondent which distinguishes the two
concepts, when stating that “Claimant’s characterization of the BIT’s full
protection and security standard as broad protection for its investment that
essentially is coterminous with the fair and equitable treatment standard is
misplaced. Claimant does not address, for example, authorities that have held that
the full protection and security standard is directed at different kinds of treatment
from those covered by such standards as fair and equitable treatment or
expropriation. These authorities correctly distinguish between these treaty
standards on the basis that FET and expropriation involve the investor and the host
State, whereas the full protection and security standard concerns the host State’s
obligation to exercise reasonable care in protecting the investment from actions of
third parties. This distinction between treaty standards is consistent with the effet
utile principle.” (Resp. SoD. Class. 04. 04. 2013, para. 456. References omitted).
The Tribunal considers indeed that the effet utile principle is an important element
of interpretation of legal instruments.

If a State fails to exercise vigilance or due diligence to prevent or punish such
injuries, it is responsible for this omission and is liable for the ensuing damage.
The precise degree of diligence required depends largely on the circumstances of
the case at hand.

(b) The Relevancy of the FPS Standard in the Present Case

Within the context of the Khandiza Project, the facts underlying Claimant’s
claims are mainly the revocation by the Uzbek Government of certain alleged
rights, as well as the lack of good faith and cooperation during the negotiation
process.

To the extent that these facts relate to actions or omissions of the Uzbek
Government organs, claims based thereon fall outside the scope of the FPS
standard.

As mentioned above, only conduct of a non-state entity may give rise to a claim
based on the FPS standard. In this regard, as concerns the Khandiza Project, the
only party which enters into consideration is Goskomgeology. The status of
Goskomgeology, and in particular its relationship with and functions for the
Uzbek State have not been extensively dealt with in the course of the proceedings.
The Arbitral Tribunal however considers that this question may remain open.
Indeed, if the acts of Goskomgeology are considered as attributable to the State,
such acts fall under the scope of the FET standard (and the Arbitral Tribunal has
already ruled that there was no breach of such standard, see above paras. 312 fol.).
If Goskomgeology was to be considered as a “non-state entity”, whose acts are
not attributable to the State, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that there is no factual
basis to support a breach of FPS for the following reasons:

Claimant’s claims are based on reproaches against Goskomgeology, according to
which the latter would have failed to sufficiently support Claimant’s proposal
and/or convey feedback from the Government. In other words, Goskomgeology
would have contributed to the undue failure of the negotiation process. Claimant
has however failed to substantiate and establish how this kind of alleged failure to
duly fulfil its contractual duties towards Marakand would amount to a breach by
the State of its “duty of vigilance or due diligence” towards Claimant. Claimant
has further not raised any claim based on the use of force by Goskomgeology in
the context of the Khandiza Project.

Under these circumstances, the facts underlying Claimant’s claims with regard to
the Khandiza Deposit do not fall under the scope of the FPS standard.

3.2.3.3 Conclusion

Claimant’s Khandiza Claim No. 1, to the extent it is based on a breach of the FPS
standard under Article 2(1) of the BIT, is rejected.

166

3.2.4 Claimant’s Claim for Breach of the Umbrella Clause of Article 2(2) in
fine of the BIT

3.2.4.1 The Parties’ Positions

(a) Claimant’s Position

362. According to Claimant, the taking of Claimant’s vested development rights (or
alternatively Claimant’s right to exclusive negotiations for the development of the
Deposit) also constituted a breach of the PEA and/or of the State’s undertaking,
including under CabMin Decree No. 359 and of the Law of the Republic of
Uzbekistan on Foreign Investments, in particular its Article 10 which provides
that a foreign investor has the right “to own, use and dispose [of] his investments
and result of investment activity.” By breaching its contractual and/or regulatory
undertakings, Respondent violated its international obligations under Article 2(2)
in fine of the BIT (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 323).

(b) Respondent's Position

363. According to Respondent, Claimant’s umbrella clause arguments have no merit.
First, Claimant is not a party to any of the instruments on which it purports to rely
upon and, therefore, its umbrella clause claims must fail (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 204). Second, Respondent never undertook to grant the
particular development or exploration rights that Claimant now claims. In
addition, the Law on Foreign Investments is too general in nature to support an
umbrella clause claim (by Claimant or any other party) (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 204, 206). Third, the breaches that Claimant alleges — namely,
a failure to meet purported obligations to grant development or exploration rights,
or to negotiate such rights — are purely contractual in nature, and do not constitute
sovereign measures, as needed to rise to the level of Treaty breach (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 204, 201 fol.).

3.2.4.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

(a) The Applicable Legal Basis

364. Article 2(2) in fine of the BIT provides as follows:

“(2) [...] Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have
entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the
other Contracting Party.”

167

365.

366.

367.

x

368.

oo

369.

Through an umbrella clause, the State assumes on the international level
contractual obligations it might have entered into with a foreign investor. In the
absence of an umbrella clause, the State is not liable, on the international level, for
violation of purely contractual obligations it has committed to under its national
legal order, unless liability has been found on other grounds, such as breaches of
the FET, under a BIT. This was well explained in Noble Ventures v. Romania: 10

“93. The Tribunal recalls the well established rule of general international
law that in normal circumstances per se a breach of a contract by the
State does not give rise to direct international responsibility on the part
of the State. This derives from the clear distinction between municipal
law on the one hand and international law on the other..

(J

55. Thus, an umbrella clause, when included in a bilateral investment
treaty, introduces an exception to the general separation of States
obligations under municipal and under international law.”

For a claim to be based on an umbrella clause as the one at stake, the claimant
must establish, among others, that it is the creditor of the “obligation” at stake and
this requirement has two aspects:

First of all, the obligation which is alleged to be breached must exist. If the
obligation brought forward by the claimant does not exist, it can a fortiori not be
breached.

Secondly, such obligation at stake must have been entered into by the State or
one of its organs towards the claimant specifically, and not just an affiliated or a
subsidiary of the claimant (so-called “privity requirements”) (see e.g., Burlington
v. Ecuador, para. 208 ; Azurix v. Argentina, para. 384; Siemens v. Argentina,
para. 204 ; CMS v. Argentina (Annulment), para. 95). In other words, as set out in
CMS v. Argentina (Annulment), an umbrella clause can only concern consensual
obligations and not general obligations:

“In speaking of ‘any obligations it may have entered into with regard to
investment,’ it seems clear that Article II(2)I is concerned with consensual
obligations arising independently of the BIT ... They do not cover general
requirements imposed by law. (para. 95(a); emphasis added))

Indeed, an umbrella clause can only apply to specific committments, because if it
were to apply to all legal undertakings of the State in its national law, it would
render the other standard of protection superfluous, as well expressed in SGS v.
Pakistan :

'° Noble Ventures v. Romania,, para. 53 and para. 55.

168

370.

37

372.

373.

o

374.

“[T]he claimant's view of Article 11 tends to make Articles 3 to 7 of the BIT
substantially superfluous. There would be no real need to demonstrate a
violation of those substantive treaty standards if a simple breach of contract,
or of municipal statute or regulation by itself, would suffice to constitute a
treaty violation on the part of a Contracting Party and engage the
international responsibility of the Party” (Decision, para. 168)

These principles were also clearly stated by the tribunal in Noble Ventures:

“Considering that Art. II (2)I BIT" uses the term “shall” and that it forms
part of the Article which provides for the major substantial obligations
undertaken by the parties, there can be no doubt that the Article was
intended to create obligations, and obviously obligations beyond those
specified in other provisions of the BIT itself. [...] The employment of the
notion “entered into” indicates that specific commitments are referred to
and not general commitments, for example by way of legislative acts. This is
also the reason why Art. II (2)I would be very much an empty base unless
understood as referring to contracts.”

. If the violation of any legal obligation contained in the national legal order would

be transformed by an umbrella clause into a violation of the Treaty, whatever the
internal source of the obligation or the seriousness of the breach, it would be
sufficient to include an umbrella clause in the Treaty and no other standard of
protection. This would result in the fact that the whole national legal order would
be automatically internationalized through an umbrella clause, which cannot be.

(b) The Relevancy of the Umbrella Clause in the Present Case

In order to decide on Claimant’s claim, it is therefore firstly necessary to
determine what is the “obligation” which has allegedly been breached and what
sort of breach would amount to a breach of the umbrella clause.

In this regard, Claimant relies on two main types of “obligations” including (i) the
alleged contractual entitlement to the development rights in the Khandiza Deposit
and (ii) the alleged legal entitlement under Article 10 of the the Law on Foreign
Investments “to own, use and dispose [of] his investments and result of investment
activity.”

As concerns the alleged contractual entitlement to development rights in the
Khandiza Deposit, the Arbitral Tribunal has already found that through the PEA
Claimant did not secure the alleged unconditional right to develop Khandiza, but
only a right to formal, exclusive and good faith negotiations to develop the

   

"This Article reads as follows
into with regard to investments.

‘Each party shall observe any obligation it may have entered

169

375.

376.

377.

378.

379.

380.

Khandiza Deposit jointly with the Uzbek Parties on mutually acceptable terms
(see above para. 287).

As such, the relevant “obligation” under the umbrella clause of Article 2(2) of the
BIT is the duty to negotiate on an exclusive basis and in good faith a mutually
acceptable agreement for the development of the Khandiza Deposit.

Thus, firstly, the mere failure to be granted such development rights cannot be
deemed to constitute a breach of an “obligation” in the sense of the umbrella
clause of Article 2(2) of the BIT, as such contractual obligation did not exist.
Secondly, to the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal found that the way in which the
Uzbek Government managed the negotiation process with Goskomgeology and/or
Marakand does not reach the threshold of a breach of the FET standard (see above
para. 346), it is difficult to see how it could breach the umbrella clause based on a
breach of the PEA.

Finally, another hurdle which Claimant has not overcome is the fact that the
parties to the PEA are Goskomgeology and Marakand and not the State and Oxus.
As such, the privity requirement would be an additional impediment which would
prevent Claimant to rely on the umbrella clause with regard to the “revocation” of
its alleged contractual rights to development of the Khandiza Deposit.

The situation is similar if looking at the Law on Foreign Investments in
connection with CabMin Decree No. 359.

As mentioned above (para. 368), the umbrella clause refers to obligations “entered
into” which implies a counterpart and not a general undertaking of an obligation.
In this regard, the Law on Foreign Investments is a law of general nature setting
out obligations of the State in a general way. As such, a breach of Article 10 of
the Law on Foreign Investments is per se not sufficient to constitute a breach of
the umbrella clause.

Claimant attempts to remedy this defect by invoking CabMin Decree No. 359
which is a decree specifically aimed at Oxus and not just a general legislation act.
However, this Decree is of no avail to Claimant. First, Claimant’s claim of a
breach of such Decree presupposes that it had acquired the specific right to
develop the Khandiza Deposit and was deprived of the ownership, use or disposal
of such right. However, as mentioned above, the Arbitral Tribunal ruled that
Claimant did not hold this right in the extent it alleges. It only held a right to
exclusive and good faith negotiations of a mutually acceptable agreement. Thus,
as mentioned with regard to the alleged breach of the PEA (see above para. 376),
to the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal found that the way in which the Uzbek
Government managed the negotiation process with Goskomgeology and/or

170

381.

382.

383.

384.

385.

Marakand does not reach the threshold of a breach of the FET standard (see above
para. 346), it is difficult to see how it could breach the umbrella clause based on a
breach of Decree No. 359.

As a result, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimant has failed to establish
that it actually held an “obligation” protected by the umbrella clause.

3.2.4.3 Conclusion

Claimant’s Khandiza Claim No. 1, to the extent it is based on a breach of the
umbrella clause of Article 2(2) in fine of the BIT, is rejected.

With Regard to the Claims Relating to the Expanded Area

4.1 The Problem

As mentioned above (para. 241), it is undisputed that Claimant was afforded the
right under the PEA to explore the Expanded Area, which was originally 12,000
km’. It is further undisputed that this area was reduced twice, once by
Supplementary Agreement No. 2 to the PEA of 9 June 2000 (see above para.
165), by which the area was reduced by half, i.e. to 5,259 km’ and a second time,
by Supplemental Agreement No. 6 to the PEA of 15 October 2004, whereby it
was reduced from 5,259 km? to 1,199.5 km? (see above para. 182).

It is further undisputed that the first reduction implemented by the Supplementary
Agreement No. 2 was contemplated by the PEA and therefore unproblematic. The
key question is thus whether the reduction of the Expanded Area as implemented
by Supplemental Agreement No. 6 was in breach of any of Respondent’s
obligations under the BIT.

4.2 The Parties’ Positions

According to Claimant, the reduction of the Expanded Area implemented by the
Supplemental Agreement No. 6 was not contemplated by the PEA and therefore
constitutes a taking of Claimant’s investment. In this regard, Goskomgeology,
who signed the Supplemental Agreement No. 6 must be seen as an agent of the
State and the reduction of the size constitutes an expropriation as well as a breach
of Respondent’s obligations under Article 2 of the BIT (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, paras. 280 fol., 354 fol.).

171

386.

387.

388.

389.

390.

391.

According to Respondent, the PEA granted ORC exploration rights only from 14
December 1996 to 14 December 2001. Goskomgeology repeatedly agreed in good
faith to extend the duration of the PEA, but Claimant had no right to such
“extension”. Thus, when the Expanded Area was reduced to 1,199.5 km? in
October 2004, Goskomgeology did not take anything from ORC or Marakand, as
neither ORC nor Marakand had a right that its existing exploration rights be once
again extended (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 168).

4.3 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

Claimant’s claim is based on a two-folded presumption that (i) it had the right to
explore the full 5,259 km’ of the Khandiza Expanded Area and that (ii) this right
was unduly taken away by Goskomgeology through the signing of Supplemental
Agreement No. 6.

The right to explore the Khandiza Expanded area arises from the PEA. The PEA
was entered into for an initial period of five years expiring on 31 December 2001.
ORC/Marakand and Goskomgeology agreed several times, in total seven times, to
extend the duration of the PEA from 31 December 2001 to 31 December 2005
(see above paras. 173, 177, 182, 188, 197, 210, 220).

At the time of entering into the Supplemental Agreement No. 6 on 15 October
2004, the PEA had already been extended twice by Supplemental Agreement No.
3 and No. 5 (see above paras. 173 and 177). Thus, without these extensions, the
rights deriving from the PEA, including the exploration rights in Khandiza
Expanded Area, would have expired.

In other words, the signing of Supplemental Agreement No. 6 did not “deprive”
Claimant of any right, but instead extended a right which would have otherwise
expired. While it is true that the extension concerned only part of the previous
right, i.e. 1,199.5 km’ instead of 5,259 km’, for Claimant to have been “deprived”
of anything, it would need to establish that it was entitled or otherwise had a
legitimate expectation that its exploration right would be extended for the entire
Extended Area. In the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal, Claimant has failed to
establish such right to an extension.

Failing an entitlement to the extension of its exploration rights on the Khandiza
Expanded Area, Claimant’s claim under Article 5 or 2 of the BIT are unfounded.

172

4.4 Conclusion

392. Claimant’s Khandiza Claim No. 4 is hereby rejected.

5. With Regard to the Quantum

5.1 In General

393. To the extent the Arbitral Tribunal has considered Claimant’s claims for breach of
Articles 2 and 5 of the BIT as unfounded, Claimant’s claims for damage lack the
necessary basis.

394. The only remaining question is whether Claimant may be entitled to a restitution
of the amount invested by Claimant in the Khandiza Project (see above para. 133
‘Claimant’s Khandiza Claim 2.1.4’, so-called “Claim for sunk costs”).

5.2 As Concerns the Sunk Costs

5.2.1 The Parties’ Positions

395. According to Claimant, with regard to the sunk costs, it can rely on Article 4 of
the PEA, which provided for a right to sunk costs + 15% in case that
Goskomgeology entered into a joint venture agreement with a third party within
three years of the signing of the PEA, and Supplemental Agreement No. 1, which
— according to Claimant — cancelled the “opt out alternative” with the
consequence that Claimant had the legimitate expectation not only to be
reimbursed its full sunk costs +15% uplift, but full compensation for the actual
value of the investment (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 415).

396. According to Respondent, Claimant is not entitled to reimbursement of costs
because it expressly waived any purported right to them under Supplemental
Agreement No. 8 (Art. ii).

5.2.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings
397. The relevant provisions provide as follows:

(i) Article 4 of the PEA provides:

173

“iv. after one (1) year from the effective date of this Agreement, it will
enter into formal negotiations with Oxus to create a Joint
Venture Agreement pertaining to the Property. If
Goskomgeologia shall, with the positive results of the Phase 1
Study, waive of entering into Joint Venture Agreement pertaining
to the Property, and if, within three (3) years [i.e., until 10 July
1997] of the signing of this Agreement Goscomgeologia shall
enter into negotiations for a Joint Venture Agreement pertaining
to the Property with an independent party, then Goscomgeologia
shall reimburse Oxus for all expenses incurred during the Phase
I Study _plus_an_additional_fifteen percent (15%) of those
expenses.” (emphasis added)

(ii) The Supplemental Agreement No. 1 amended Article 4(iv) of the PEA
as follows (see above para. 143):

vi. upon the termination of all exploration and development, Oxus
shall be obliged to return the affected land and environment to its
original state as at the date when exploration was first begun
(any _such _restoration work _to be done _according _to
internationally recognised environmental standards); and to
remove all equipment and structures, unless they are useful to the
local community; [...]”” (emphasis added)

 

 

 

(iii) | The Supplemental Agreement No. 8 provided as follows (see above
para. 197):

“Marakand will not claim monetary recovery as to expenses incurred
during Feasibility Study preparation and exploration works in the
Territory.”

398. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that, to the extent Claimant’s claim for
sunk costs is based on the PEA and/or its Supplemental Agreements, it is a mere
contractual right towards Goskomgeology. Mere contractual breaches in principle
fall outside the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, unless they constitute at the
same time a breach of Respondent’s obligations under the BIT. As laid out in the
considerations above, the Arbitral Tribunal has found that Respondent’s conduct
in the negotiations of a Khandiza concession or Joint Venture agreement was not
in breach of any BIT standard, and that instead Claimant was largely aware of the
existing challenges and made strategic choices for which it has to bear
responsibility. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal does not see how the removal during
the negotiations of any clause for compensation of sunk costs would justify a
different treatment than other aspects of the contractual negotiations.

Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that there is no basis in the BIT for
compensation of the sunk costs.

5.3 Conclusion

Claimant’s Khandiza Claim No. 2, including all sub-claims (2.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2,
2.1.3 and 2.1.4) as well as Claim No. 3.1 (including sub-claims 3.1.1 and 3.1.2)
are rejected.

The Claims Regarding the AGF Project

The Key Facts

The following summary of facts follows an over-all chronological order, although
certain issues have been re-grouped together in order to facilitate the
understanding of the key events. As such, the chronological order applies to the
over-all timeline, but not always to the specific issues.

1.1 1998-2004: Reminder of the Origins of AGF and the Launch of the
Operations

As mentioned above (see paras 37 fol.), AGF was established through a Joint
Venture Agreement entered into on 24 November 1993 between Goskomgeology,
NMMK, Lonrho and the IFC. The legal framework applicable to the Joint Venture
and its specific operations was put into place during the year 1994, including in
particular through the Decree No. DP-837, the Decree No. 477 and the Original
AGF’s Charter.

In the course of 1998, ORC expressed its interest in becoming a partner in the
AGF Joint Venture following the announcement of the withdrawal of Lonrho. To
that purpose, ORC submitted a ‘Proposed Development Programme’ (Exhs. C-
209/C-596). It contemplated a two-phase development of the Amantaytau site:
Phase 1 consisted in the Open-Pit Project involving the development of oxide
deposits of Amantaytau Centralny, Uzunbulak and Vyskokovoltnoye in extracting
gold by open-pit mine and heal-leach processing, and Phase 2, which consisted in
the Underground Project, focused mainly on exploiting the underground mine to
harness sulphide deposits found in Amantaytau Centralny and Amantayatu
Severny (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 243).

175

404. On 1 October 1999, the CabMin issued ‘Decree No. 425-108’, approving ORC’s
shares and rights in AGF (Exh. C-211, see above para. 49). Then, in the course of
2000, various agreements and legislative acts were implemented to give effect to
the fact that ORC was joining the AGF Joint Venture (see above paras. 53 fol.).

405. On_7 December _1999, CSMA issued an ‘Jnterim Feasibility Study on
Amantaytau Goldfields AO’ (hereinafter “CSMA Interim Feasibility Study”)
(Exh. C-444). It proposed a detailed development program for the Phase | mining
of the three principal near-surface oxide desposits of Amantaytau Centralny,
Uzunbulak and Vysovoltnoye, as well as a scoping level study for the Phase 2
underground sulphide deposits mining at Amantaytau Severny and Centralny. The
Feasibility Study concluded as follows:

(i) As concerns the Phase 1 development of the oxide deposits:

“For the oxides, the conclusions from this study are positive and the project
has been proved to be economically viable.

A reserve statement complying with criteria as described within the JORC
code indicates a robust oxide reserve estimate of 10.4 Mt @ 2.87 g/t Au,
which includes a silver-rich portion at Vysokovoltnoye of 5.75 Mt @ 1.30 g/t
Au and 49.44 g/t Ag.

The Project NPV pre-tax, ungeared is $37.1 million at a 12% discount rate,
equivalent to an IRR of 65.1%. The ungeared NPV after tax is $29.7 million,
equivalent to an IRR of 55.2%.

Based on Oxus 43% ownership of AGF the NPV to Oxus is $14.9 million,
equivalent to an IRR of 39.9%.

Consequently, it is recommended that a definitive feasibility study (DFS) be
completed on the oxides with a view to early construction and
commissioning of gold production. [...)” (pp. 12-13) (emphasis as in
original)

(ii) As concerns the Phase 2 development of the sulphide deposits:
“[...] The sulphide development proposed by Oxus is markedly different to
that envisaged by Lonrho and thus many of the parameters used by Lonrho

are not applicable to the Oxus study. Consequently, CSMA can only provide
a scoping level report on the sulphide development programme.

To upgrade this scoping level work to pre-feasibility standard, a number of
recommendations are made: [...]”"

406. On 3 May 2000, Mr. Rakhimov, Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of

Uzbekistan, sent a Letter no. 1308/1062 to AGF concerning the permitted use of
foreign currency account (Exh. R-42; see also above para. 50):

176

“a) The following foreign currency may be credited to the said account:
- contributions to the share fund received from foreign founders;
- loans received from foreign financial entities.
b) The funds kept on an open account may be used:
- to repay foreign loans;
- to pay debts to foreign creditors in foreign currency;
- to pay bank fees according the bank’s rates.
At that said, it is necessary to note that paying from an account abroad
under import contracts and crediting foreign currency earnings under

export to those are strictly prohibited ”. ( hasis as in
original).

407. On 28 July 2000, AGF held one of the first General Shareholders Meetings
including ORC as a shareholder (Exh. R-400). As mentioned above (see para. 56),
the shareholders discussed among other matters the issue of “the situation with
bankable feasibility study (FS) of AGF for the Stage 1 and proposed work
program for completion of the FS and debt financing.” When dealing with this
item, Mr. Turner provided a status report as follows:

“As Oxus would like to hold negotiations on debt financing at the
Stage I not later than October this year, R. Turner specified the key
issues that need to be settled for obtaining of debt financing.

He said that to get financing it is necessary to: perform state
registration of redrafted JV AGF Charter; make amendments to the
existing Fiscal Provisions of the JV; to get a subsoil license, State
Property Committee order for transfer of geological and other
information and rights to geological exploration and deposit
development and to register JV AGF shares. It is also necessary to
start preparation of the agreements on rendering of management
services, loans and loan obligations.

R. Turner presented AGF work schedule for the nearest future.

Upon discussion of all issues the shareholders unanimously decided
to:

1.1 Take into account the information presented by AGF General
Director (R. Turner) and commission him with strict control of
AGF work schedule observance (attached hereto) and all work
planned under the project;

1.2 Commission Oxus (R. Wilkins and K. Taylor) with commencing of
preparation of the Shareholders Loan Agreement that shall be
entered into between Oxus and AGF and shall be a part of the set

177

L.

of guarantee documents for debt financing by third parties and
after the Audit Commission gives its opinion on AGF annual
reports for 1998 and 1999 and confirmation of Oxus costs related
to AGF project, to approve transfer of $813955 by Oxus to the
Authorized Fund in form of equipment (in the amount of $300000)
and the loan provided by Oxus to AGF during 1998 and 1999 in
the amount of $513955, thus, increasing Oxus contribution to the
Authorized Fund to the required amount of $5813955;

1”

408. On 1 August 2000, Mr. Maksudov, from the Cabinet of Ministers, issued a letter
to ORC and AGF specifying that Decree No. 266 “does not restrict [AGF JV] in
obtaining loans from a third party provided any such loans obtained to conduct
the JV activity at stage I are arreanged by [ORC] and do not require guarantees
of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan.” (Exh. C-597).

409. On 11 August 2000, based on the CSMA Interim Feasibility Study, CSMA issued
a bankable ‘Feasibility Study of Amantaytau Goldfields AO for Oxus Gold

Corporation’

(hereinafter “CSMA Bankable Feasibility Study for Phase 1”)

(Exhs. R-281/C-526). It concluded as follows with regard to the financial analysis
of the AGF Project:

“12.5 Summary of Financial Analysis

Total capital expenditure is $45.8 million, of which the pre-production
capital cost is $34.6 million.

The Project NPV (after tax, ungeared) is $26.8 million at a 10%
discount rate, equivalent to an IRR of 43.3.

Oxus NPV, at 10% discount rate, on 50% ownership of AGF is
estimated to be $ 14.1 million, equivalent to an IRR to Oxus of 30.6%.

The Oxus share of distributable cash (management fees, taxes &
royalties, dividends), excluding project loan repayments, over the life of
the Project is $29.9 million, or 39.9% of the total.

Ungeared, the cash cost of production per ounce is $112, the direct
production cost is $177.24, and the total (taxed) cost is $202. This
implies a break-even gold price for the Project of approximately $225
per ounce, if contingency is allowed for shareholder or bank loan
interest.”

410. On 15 September 2000, AGF was issued a ‘License for Right to Use Sub-soil in
the Republic of Uzbekistan’. It provided AGF, among others, with the right to
“carry out geological exploration and mining of useful resources containing

178

411.

precious metals and other accompanying raw materials” for all of AGF’s open-pit
mines in the Amantaytau project territory (hereinafter “Open-Pit Mining
License”) (Exh. C-320). This license provided for a “term of validity” as follows:
“{ujntil complete economically profitable mining of existing and newly
discovered deposits”, although the license also provided for a series of
circumstances justifying termination of the license as follows:

“Right to use sub-soil shall be terminated :
When AGF repudiates license for right ot use sub-soil;

On rise of circumstances excluding further performance of granted right to
use sub-soil;

If AGF does not commence usage of sub-soil within one year starting from
date of issuance of license;

On occurrence of ovious threat of life or health of people working and living
in zone of impact of work associated with usage of sub-soil;

If AGF violates established in the Republic of Uzbekistan rules and
standards for usage, protection of sub-soil and environment, safe
performance of work associate with usage of sub-soil;

If usage of sub-soil is performed not in compliance with purpose for which
right was granted;

In case of systematic non-payment of payments for usage of sub-soil by
AGF;

Liquidation of AGF or stoppage of its activity;

Right to use sub-soil shall be terminated by annulment of this license by
Goscomgeology with concordance with Cabinet of Ministers and act
identifying mine lease area by agency Snoatkontekhnazorat (State Tehcnical
Inspection).

Decision on termination, temporary stoppage or limitation of right to use
sub-soil ahead of time may be appealed by AGF in legal form.”

On 2 December 2000, the Ministry of Justice issued Decree No. 988 on
‘Regulations on the Order of Registration of Export-Import Contracts (Contracts
Agreement) entered into by business entities of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Republic of Uzbekistan’ (Exh. R-
239). According to this Decree, certain contracts, including contracts for import
and export of goods, were required to be registered with the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations. Article III, regarding the conditions for registration of such
contracts, provided as follows:

“IH. Requisite conditions for registration of export-import contracts

To register the contract it is required that:

179

412.

413.

414,

Conditions of the contract comply with generally accepted rules of
international trade, existing legislation and statutory acts of the Republic of
Uzbekistan, as well as liabilities to other states and_ international
organizations accepted by the Republic of Uzbekistan;

Prices specified in the contract correspond to average international prices
and existing state of the market;

Required set of documents specified in the II section of the Regulations is
provided.”

On 18 June 2001, Mr. Akhmedov from Goskomgeology sent a letter to the Head
of Department on Development of Fuel and Energy Complex of the CabMin,
providing certain explanations about the financing of the Project (Exh. R-1096).
The letter referred to certain delays as follows:

“The main constraining factor for the start of construction of “Amantaytau

Goldfields” JV is a delay in the start of financing:

- During the last month Oxus company performed listing on the London
Stock Exchange in order to obtain additional funds for construction.

- The negotiations with Barclays Bank and Societe Generale Bank on the
loan for the project are in the final stage (issues of the bank interest
rate for the loan are being discussed).

- So far, the Ministry of Finance and the State Tax Committee are pending
the Provision on taxation of “Amantaytau Goldfields” JV, which is
required to be submitted to the banks for obtaining loans.”

On 29 June 2001, Oxus was listed on AIM and trading of shares began on 4 July
2001 (Exh. C-214). According to Claimant, Oxus achieved a market capitalization
of around GBP 37 million (Exh. C-30) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 251).
According to Respondent, its listing was disappointing as its list price on 4 July
2001 was only 30 pence, i.e. one-third of its initial valuation. Thus, Claimant did
not mobilize the anticipated cash to fund the AGF Project as planned (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 133).

On 10 August 2001, the MinFin and the State Tax Committee jointly issued
Regulation No. 76 ‘On Taxation, Accounting and Reporting for the AGF
Goldfields Joint Venture’ (hereinafter “Regulation No. 76”) (Exh. C-217). It
collated AGF’s various investment protections and guarantees into one document.
It provided, among others, as follows:

2. Income Tax

180

4) The JV shall commence paying income (profit) tax upon expiry
of five years from the moment (date) of completion of one of the events
as follows:

- sale of the first lot of the Product;

- State acceptance of the processing plant for the oxide ore to be
mined by open pit methods.

4. Value Added Tax

15. JV shall be exempt from the Value Added Tax (VAT) in respect of
imported materials and equipment, works and services which are used
for construction by contractors or sub-contractors until commissioning
of the Second Phase of Operations.

16. The amount of VAT actually paid to contractors or sub-contractors for
the acquisition of such materials, equipment, works and services in the
course of the construction and until commissioning of the Second Phase
of Operations shall be offset against the sub-soil usage tax (royalty).
Should the VAT amount exceed the amount of sub-soil usage tax
(royalty) due, the excess of VAT shall be offset against sub-soil usage
tax (royalty) due in the subsequent reporting period.

7. Property Tax

25. AGF shall be exempt of Property Tax for the entire period of its
activities.

8. Customs Duties

26. JV shall be exempt from the customs duties for the whole period of its

which provide with technical services and consultations to Amantaytau
Goldfields JV.

In the event of adverse changes in the tax regime of the Republic of
Uzbekistan, which worsen conditions of JV’s functioning, the legal acts
valid as at I July 2000, including this Regulation, shall remain in force
until 1 July 2010. “

415. On 28 November 2001, the CabMin issued the license AC No. 002 authorizing
AGF to engage in the mining of precious metals (hereinafter “Mining License”)
(C-312). This license was issued for five years, i.e. until 27 November 2006.

416.

On 25 December 2001, Goskomgeology, acting as a specially authorized body on
instruction of the CabMin, entered into a ‘License Agreement’ with AGF
(Exh. C-633). It provided AGF with the following rights and obligations:

“Le

418.

requirements and terms are observed by AGF, and to take certain actions
depending on the results of such audit.

As of 31 December 2001, ORC’s shareholder loans to AGF amounted to approx.
USD 6.1 million (see Preamble of C-447; Wilkins II 43).

On 31 May 2002, AGF held an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders,
during which it was decided among others as follows (Exh. C-606):

“3. [...]

5.1 To enter into the loan agreement with Oxus regarding the
allocation to the Company of the Oxus loan facility as subordinated to
the Société Généale loan facility and taking second priority to the
Société Générale loan facility in all respects (“Oxus Loan

On 17 July 2002, ORC and AGF entered into a ‘Credit Agreement relating to the
Amantaytau Gold Project in Uzbekistan’ (hereinafter “Credit Agreement”) with
Société Générale and other banks (Exhs. C-496/R-1026). Under this Credit
Agreement, Société Générale agreed to loan USD 26 million and a cost overrun
facility of USD 5 million, subject to certain conditions precedent, including
Claimant obtaining USD 15.35 million in secondary financing (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 136).

On the same day, ORC and AGF entered into a ‘Loan Agreement No. 001-2002’
(hereinafter “Shareholder Loan Agreement 2002”) (Exh. C-447), under which
ORC lended to AGF the USD 6,1 million previously lent (see above para. 417), as
well as an additional loan of USD 21 million for the purpose of developing and
constructing the AGF Project.

On the same day, Mr. Turner on behalf of AGF and Mr. Wilkins on behalf of
ORC entered into a ‘Management and Services Agreement’ (hereinafter “AGF
Management Agreement”) (Exh. C-407) and a ‘General and Administration
Agreement’ (hereinafter “AGF Administration Agreement”) (Exh. R-149). Under
the former Agreement, ORC was to receive a management fee of 5% of AGF’s
operating costs, including “all costs associated with the operation, management,
maintenance and repair of the Project, including stripping, mining, rehandling,
processing, environmental, insurance, refining, general and administration costs,
inclusive of payroll costs associated with these activities, and also inclusive of
VAT if such VAT is not recoverable [...]” (Article 4.1), and, under the latter
Agreement, AGF undertook to reimburse ORC for its “general and
administration costs and expenses incurred by it in relation to its appointment as
manager of the Project” (Article 2.1).

On the the same day, Goskomgeology and AGF entered into an ‘Advisory and
Services Agreement’ (hereinafter “AGF Services Agreement”) (Exh. C-280),
under which Goskomgeology was to receive a management fee of 2% of the costs
of AGF’s operating costs (see Article 2.1).

On_19 July 2002, Mr. Turner on behalf of AGF entered into a ‘Contract
Agreement No. 10020 for Lump Sum Turnkey Construction of Amantaytau
Plant’ with a sub-contractor, MAED (represented by Mr. Trew) (hereinafter
“MAED Sub-Contract Agreement”) (Exh. R-150). Through this contract, AGF
entrusted MAED with the completion of the so-called “Amantaytau Heap Leach
Gold Project”, i.e. the construction of a heap leach processing plant for the AGF
Project for a total contract price of USD 10,696 million.

On 23 August 2002, Mr. Manapbekov, Head of the Department for External
Economic Relations and Foreign Investments of the CabMin, sent a letter to
Claimant confirming that no export license was required to export gold and silver
(Exh. C-234):

“[...] under paragraph 4 of Article 12 of the Law of the Republic of
Uzbekistan “On Foreign Investments” no export license is required
for enterprises with foreign capital for exporting its own production.
Furthermore, by Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan of
22 September 1994, No. 477 “On Formation of the JV AGF and on
Matters of Ensuring Its Effective Functioning,” and authorization was
already given to the JV for the export and sale, at world market
prices, of gold, silver and other products obtained during the
treatment of gold deposits.”

On _29 October _2002, Oxus announced that MAED owned an interest in
34,930,237 ordinary shares in the company and that “certain individuals who are
employees of Maed or are otherwise associated with Maed (being persons referred
to as Maed’s ‘ceassociated ownership entities’) in Maed’s letter to Oxus dated 12
August 2002) have nonnotifiable interests in a further 2,342,700 Oxus Shares”
(Exh. R-511).

After this acquisition, Oxus put in place a new management team, composed of
Messrs Trew (MAED’s Managing Director and founder and Oxus’ new CEO),
Donald, Kipps, Shead and Wilkins. Mr. Wilkins was the only one who was
already in the management before MAED’s acquisition (Exhs. R-1, R-401; R-
576) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 143).

On_1 January 2003, Messrs Trew, Kipps and Crowe on behalf of ORC signed a
contract with Mining Resources Trust (hereinafter “MRT”) and AGF, pursuant to
which MRT agreed to provide consultancy services to AGF concerning the
financing, design and construction of the Phase 1 Project (hereinafter “MRT
Consulting Contract”) (Exh. R-152). According to section 2 of this contract, the
value of the contract was not to exceed USD 2 million during its term, without the
prior written approval of the Parties. The core obligations of MRT under this

186

427.

428.

429.

contract consisted in making available to ORC experienced personnel able to
assist in the completion of the financing from the appropriate lending banks, as
well as for the completion of the construction of the Project. In case of early
completion of the project, MRT was to be entitled to an additional fee of 2.5% of
the pre-production capital costs of the Project. According to Respondent, this
contract was not approved by AGF General Meeting of Shareholders, nor did
AGF register it, in violation of AGF’s charter and the law (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 144).

On _ 24 January 2003, Oxus issued a document called ‘Amendments to the
Feasibility Report on the Amantaytau Goldfields A.O. JV Project for the Oxus
Resources Corporation’ (hereinafter “Amended Phase 1 Feasibility Study”)
(Exhs. R-289/C-527) amending the CSMA Bankable Feasibility Study for Phase
1. The main change concerned the processing technology, i.e. the switch from the
originally proposed heap-leach technology to a conventional milling and Carbon-
In-Pulp (CIP) treatment plan, which MAED would build and for which MAED
would perform mining works as contractor for a total amount of USD 12,850,050.
The reasons given by Oxus for this change were manifold, including (i): the need
for a reduction in capital cost, and (ii) the need to increase the gold extraction
rates (see “Introduction”). According to the estimates of the Amended Phase 1
Feasibility Study, the Project would allow producing over 635,000 ounces of gold
with total production costs of USD 162 per ounce, thereby generating USD 223,3
million in hard currency revenues from its gold sales. Based on estimated
operating costs of USD 82,9 million, the Project would allow to yield profits of
USD 46,353 million for Oxus (including USD 37,543,000 in dividends, USD
4,167,000 in management fees, USD 3,960,000 in administrative fees and USD
683,000 in interest on its loan to AGF) and USD 53,137 for the Uzbek Parties and
the State (including USD 37,543 in dividends, USD 13,927 in taxes and royalties,
and USD 1,667 for Goskomgeology’s management fees) (see Table 12 at Exh. R-
289_86 and Table at R-289_89; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 145, 177).

On 24 March 2003, Mr. Crowe and Mr. Salamtin, on behalf of AGF, and Mr.
Mather and Mr. Stuart, on behalf of MAED, entered into an ‘Amendment to
Contract Agreement’ by which they amended the MAED Sub-Contract
Agreement (see above para. 423) providing for the construction of an Oxide
Milling Plant instead of the heap-leach technology and increasing the value of the
works sub-contracted to MAED from USD 10,696 million to USD 18,7 million
(hereinafter “MAED Sub-Contract Amendment”) (Exh. R-153).

On 28 March 2003, Mr. Crowe on behalf of AGF and the Executive Chairman of

BCM" on behalf of BCM entered into a ‘Contract No. 0021-G’ (hereinafter
“BCM Sub-Contract Agreement”) (Exh. R-154), under which AGF sub-

'’ The name of the Executive Chairman of BCM is not readable on the document.

contracted works for a total amount of approx. USD 60 million to BCM.
According to Respondent, Claimant did so without conducting a competitive
tender and contrary to industry norms and Uzbek laws in order to increase
Claimant’s management fees (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 145).

430. On 2 April 2003, Oxus, AGF, Standard Bank and WestLB AG concluded an
‘Amendment and Restatement Agreement relating to a Credit Agreement dated
17 July 2002” (hereinafter “Financing Agreement”) (Exh. C-219).'* It changed
the Parties to the original Credit Agreement (see above para. 418) but otherwise
confirmed the terms of the former Credit Agreement, including in particular the
hedging provisions.

431. In the following days, the Financing Agreement was registered with the Central
Bank of Uzbekistan (Exhs. C-424 and C-221).

432. On 15 April 2003, AGF and Standard Bank entered into a ‘Gold Offtake
Agreement’ (hereinafter “Original Gold Offtake Agreement”) (Exh. C-222). It
provided for the sale to Standard Bank of 263,096 ounces of gold at a hedged
price of USD 323,35 per ounce (which corresponded to the gold price on the date
of signature of the Agreement) (see Article 4.5.1 in connection with Appendix 2).
It also provided for sales of unhedged gold at the market rate on the date of the
sale, i.e., the ‘spot price’ (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 261).

433. On 22 May 2003, the Agency for Foreign Economic Activities (““AFER”)
provided certain comments concerning the Gold Offtake Agreement (Exh. C-
664). As concerns the hedged price, the AFER commented as follows:

“3. A total price of the contract to be defined. Definition of “other
gold” to be given.

4. Clause 6 Payments. A mechanism and an amount of payment for
263,096 ounces of gold, as well as an amount of payment for
“other gold” to be specified. Availability and an amount of
prepayment or an advance payment to be specified in the contract.
A cash set-off mechanism for supplies to be defined.”

434. From 9 to 20 June 2003, the State Tax Committee conducted a first Audit of AGF
as provided under Article 10.1 of the Law No. 717-1 ‘On State Control over
Activities of Business Entities’ dated 24 December 1998 (Exh. R-456):

“Article 10-1. Frequency of scheduled audits of financial and economic
activities of enterprises

'' The names of the signatories of this Agreement are not provided in the document and the
signatures themselves do not allow the Arbitral Tribunal to identify such signatories.

188

LJ

Routine inspections of the financial and economic activities of small firms,
small businesses and farms shall be conducted no more than once every four
years, and for other business entities — not more than once every three years.

The financial and economic activities of the newly established small firms
and small enterprises and farms shall not be subject of the planned
inspections for two years from the date of their registration.”

As concerns unscheduled audits, this law provided as follows:

“Article 12. Unscheduled inspections

An unscheduled inspection to check activities of a business entity may be
performed on the basis of a decision to carry out an unscheduled inspection
taken by a special authorized body, which shall specify the name of the
business entity to be inspected, its taxpayer ID, purposes of the inspection,
timeframes for carrying out the inspection and reasons behind it; as well as
the order issued by the relevant controlling authority that is to perform the
inspection specifying the officers who will perform the inspection and
timeframes for its performance”.

435. On or around this date, according to Claimant, the construction of Phase 1 began
(Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 262).

436. On 6 October 2003, AGF’s internal Audit Committee issued a report (hereinafter
“AGF Audit Committee Report 2003”) (Exh. R-156), which concluded as
follows:

“Commission has studied the copies of the original documents proving the
production expenditures and ascertained that:

The documents proving expenditures made by Oxus Resources Corporation
Company have not been provided in a satisfactory form regarding item
Nos 1 [MAED Invoice No. A004], 2 [MAED Invoice No. A005], 3
[MAED Invoice No. A002] and 4 [MAED Invoice No. A003].

Commission considers it possible to recommend to the General Meeting of
Shareholders to acknowledge the expenditures accrued by Oxus Resources
Corporation Company during 6 months confirmed for 2003 with regard to

AGF-06-01] and 7 [Contract with MRT No. 03/MRT/01] for the value of
USD 796,000.00.”

437. On 10 October 2003, AGF held a General Meeting of Shareholders during which
it took, among others, the following resolutions (Exh. C-624):

“After a discussion the following agenda has been UNANIMOUSLY

On_11 December 2003, Uzbekistan issued its amended Law ‘On Currency
Regulation’ (Exh. R-54). The purpose of this law was to regulate relations in the
field of foreign exchange operations in the Republic of Uzbekistan. With regard to
the use of foreign currency by residents in Uzbekistan, Article 16 of the Law on
Currency Regulation provided as follows:

“Article 16. Accounts of residents
LJ
Foreign currency funds of legal entities-residents are kept on foreign

currency accounts in the authorized banks of the Republic of Uzbekistan and
are used by those residents in accordance with the legislation.

Foreign currency received by legal entities-residents, including
foreign exchange proceeds from export of goods (works, services), must be
transferred to their accounts in the authorized banks, unless otherwise
stipulated by the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

The legal entities-residents are entitled to set up and manage any
national and foreign currency accounts in the banks outside the Republic of
Uzbekistan in accordance with the procedure set out by the Central Bank of
the Republic of Uzbekistan.”

In early January 2004, the gold production at Amantaytau began (Wilkins II, para.
51; Exh. C-450).

On 20 January 2004, AGF and Standard Bank" entered into an ‘Amended and
Restated Gold Offtake Agreement’ covering only the sale of hedged gold
(hereinafter “Amended Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement” or “HGOA”) (Exh. C-
225) as previously suggested by MinFERIT (see para. 433). With regard to the
hedging, Article 4.5.1 of the HGOA provided as follows:

“The Purchaser and the Seller agree that under this Agreement:

'S The names of the specific signatories are not identifiable.

190

441.

442.

443.

(a) total amount of deliveries of Gold shall be 263,096 ounces;

(b) the deliveries of Gold shall be made by the Seller in amounts and on
dates specified in Appendix 2;

(c) a preliminary purchase price for Gold shall be USD 323.35 per ounce
as specified in Appendix 2 (the Preliminary Purchase Price);

(d) subject to the provisions of this Clause 4.5, total amount of this
Agreement shall be USD 85,072,091.6;

(e) a purchase price for all Other Gold, if any, shall be an amount in the

United States dollars (USD) being the London AM fix which shall be
determined at the time the ownership rights over Gold pass from the
Seller to the Purchaser; amounts and dates of the deliveries of Other
Gold shall be subject to further negotiations between the Parties.”

On 26 January 2004, AGF submitted the HGOA to AFER for registration (see
reference thereto in Exh. C-229).

On_16 February 2004, following an enquiry by AGF, Mr. Nazhimov of
MinFERIT responded by Letter No. HH-01/12-543 stating that the export of gold
produced by AGF was not subject to the need of obtaining a special license, but
that “the registration of export contracts for the supply of gold by the competent
state bodies, including the AFER, in the manner prescribed by law is necessary.”
(Exh. C-229).

On 19 February 2004, Mr. Wilkins from AGF submitted the HGOA to Mr.
Ganiev, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of MinFERIT (Exh. C-228). In his
letter, Mr. Wilkins explained the terms of the hedging and its importance for the
financing of the Project. Mr. Wilkins ended his letter as follows:

“In order for the gold to be exported at the end of next week, I understand
that the Gold Offtake Agreement will need to be registered with your
Agency, as well as a local bank and the customs authorities. We first
submitted the Agreement to your Agency in May 2003. We received various
comments back which we have discussed with Standard Bank and amended
where practical. We did not proceed with the registration last year because
we were not planning any gold shipments last year and we were informed
that we would have to register separately for calendar year 2004.
Accordingly AGF and Standard Bank signed and amended Agreement on 20
January 2004. This was submitted for registration on 26 January and we
understand that it was passed to the relevant department within your Agency
on 12 February. However, the legal experts within that department have now
responded with further comments, mainly concerning pricing and payment
issues. Having persuaded Standard Bank to amend the Agreement once, we
cannot now make any further amendments to this Agreement. Time is
obviously becoming critical.

191

With respect to pricing and payment issues, I respectfully make the following
observations:

@ Decree # 477 dated 22/9/94 grants AGF the right to sell gold at world
prices, and to secure credits with joint venture property (ie gold
produced);

Decree # 266 dated 11/7/00 preserved all the rights and privileges of
Decree # 477;

The AGF Charter dated July 2000, registered with the Ministry of
Justice, permits the Company to borrow money and to hedge production,
and permits the Supervisory Board to determine the market price of the
Company's assets;

The AGF Shareholders’ Agreement dated April 2003 grants the Company
the right to sell gold in accordance with usual industry practice (which
indludes hedging);

The AGF Shareholder’s Meeting dated 26/2/03 approved the Company to
enter into the loan agreement with the banks and to enter into hedging
and gold offtake agreements;

The hedging programme was an integral part of the project finance, and
the hedging price was based on world prices at the time. Although the
spot price of gold is currently greater that the hedged price, this may not
remain the case over the next 2 years.

I would therefore be most grateful if you could investigate this matter and
assist us in expediting the regis ion of the A, and the shi, of
gold on 27 February (on Uzbek Air to London). Time is obviously of essence.
If we fail to make this shipment, AGF will be declared in breach of the
Agreement, with potentially expensive and damaging consequences. [...]”

 

444. On 20 February 2004, the AFER returned the HGOA to AGF with the refusal to
register it, together with the following recommendations (Exh. R-369):

“I. The contractual gold pricing shall be defined in accordance with the
London AM Gold Fix as of the shipment date;

2. The payment shall be carried out on a pre-paid basis or under opening
of credit;

3. The following must be specified in Act of God section: the terms of
notice of force-majeure circumstances and necessity of delivery of
notices from the cognizant authorities of the state, on whose territory
the given circumstances took place;

4. Payment of services of a security agency must be foreseen: if the
delivery is to be carried out under the EXW conditions (ex works) — at
the buyer's expense, if under the CPT conditions (airport at Zurich) — at
the seller's expense;

192

445.

446.

447.

448.

5. It shall be specified, that the contract becomes effective after being
registered in AFER;

6. The Russian and English versions shall be of equal legal effect.”

On 24 February 2004, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus sent a letter to Mr.
Kuchersky, Director of NMMC (Exh. C-230), and to Mr. Sultanov, Deputy Prime
Minister (Exh. C-231), reiterating the concerns raised in Mr. Wilkins earlier letter
to Mr. Ganiev (see above para. 443). He concluded as follows (in both letters):

“I would therefore be most gratefil if you could investigate this matter and
assist us in expediting the regis ion of the A, and the shi, of
gold on 27 February (on Uzbek Air to London). Alternatively, please could I
meet you in order to discuss how to resolve this matter. Time is obviously of
the essence. If we fail to make this shipment, AGF will be declared in breach
of the Agreement, with potentially expensive and damaging consequences.
AGF, for example, will be required to pay the difference between the hedged
price and the current gold price on 5,698 ounces [...]. Of more concern is
the future impact on the project, the general perception of Uzbek political
risk, and the ongoing relationship with the banks.”

 

In the following days, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus and Mr. Donald on behalf of
AGF sent further letters to Deputy Prime Ministers Azimov, Ganiev and Sultanov.
They reiterated their concerns in case AGF could not export its gold at the below-
market hedged price and asking for a quick resolution of the issue (Exhs. R-367
and R-368).

On_27 February 2004, AGF should have delivered 5,698 ounces of gold to
Standard Bank under the HGOA. However, according to Claimant, because
Respondent continued to maintain that no exports could take place without
registration of the agreement, AGF was prevented from exporting gold and
defaulted on this first delivery obligation of 5,698 ounces of gold, thereby
breaching the Financing Agreement (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 271).
According to Respondent, it was not possible to register the HGOA because
Uzbek law does not permit the MinFerit to register such an agreement providing
for the export of gold at below-market prices (see below para. 725 (i)).

On 3 March 2004, Mr. Najimov from the AFER sent a letter to the CabMin and
the FinMin reporting about its position on the registration of the HGOA (Exh. R-
369). In his letter, he highlighted that the Original Gold Offtake Agreement had
originally been submitted in May 2003, at which time the AFER raised certain
issues regarding the pricing. Notwithstanding that AGF had entered into a new
hedging agreement, this new agreement had not been submitted in time and the
issues regarding the pricing had not been resolved. In particular he stated as
follows:

193

449.

450.

451.

“[...] A study of documents has shown that the parties have not altered nor
updated the contract conditions related to revision of the preliminary price.
Thus and so, the fixed buying price of gold shall be 323.35 USD per ounce.

As you are well aware, the current world price of gold is at level of 410 USD
per ounce, which exceeds the fixed buying price of gold by 86 USD.
Considering the contractual obligations of the seller on shipping of 263,096
ounces of gold at the fixed price, the calculated price difference of the full
volume of the gold is estimated as 22.88 million USD.

On the other hand, in accordance with the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers
of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 477 “On establishment of the joint venture
Amantaytau Goldfields” dated September 22, 1994, a joint venture being
established is granted a right to sale gold, silver or other production,
acquired as a result of gold fields development, at world prices in freely
convertible currency in both the Republic of Uzbekistan and international
markets.

LJ

From our point of view, the proposition set forth in the joint address of the
State Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources of the Republic of
Uzbekistan and Navoi Mining & Metallurgy Combine on giving permission
for the initial shipment of gold, shall be considered on conditions of making
a corresponding decision (instruction or enactment) of the Cabinet of
Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan.”

On 4 and 11 March 2004, Mr. Wilkins from Oxus and Mr. Watts from AGF sent
further letters to Mr. Akhmedov, Chairman of Goskomgeology, and Mr.
Nazhimov, First Deputy Chairman of MinFERIT, complaining about the issues
with the registration of the HGOA (Exhs. C-224, C-238).

On 4 March 2004, the CabMin issued Decree No. 112 ‘On Licensing of mining
of precious and rare-earth metals and precious stones’ (hereinafter “Decree No.
112”) (Exh. R-185). Under this Decree, mining licenses would be issued for a
period of five years (Article 6); the term of a license may be extended based on an
application to be submitted at least two months before the expiration of the license
term (Article 25), and a decision to issue a license should be made within 30 days
of the date when the application was received (Article 14). This Decree also
provided that a license may be refused on the grounds envisaged by Article 17 of
the Law “On Licensing Certain Types of Activities” (see above para. 51; Exh. R-
144) and set out the procedure for refusal and remedies thereto (Article 19).

On 13 March 2004, Messrs Wilkins and Donald on behalf of Oxus signed a
Guarantee Letter provided by MinFERIT (hereinafter “Guarantee Letter”), under
which Oxus undertook to reimburse Respondent via regular payments of 50% of
the difference between the hedged price of gold as set out in the HGOA and
agreed maximum price of gold of USD 410 by paying this amount into a special

194

‘Reserve Fund’ (Exh. C-239) (see also earlier drafts Exhs. R-733, R-734 and R-
740) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 275; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
158).

On 16 March 2004, by Letter No. HH-b-01/02-970, Mr. Nazhimov, First Deputy
Chairman of MinFERIT, sent a letter to AGE'®. He stated that as “an inseparable
part of the Loan Agreement’, the HGOA shall not be registered with the AFER as
a separate “purchase and sale agreement”, and specified that “[i]ssues related to
implementation of loan agreements, servicing of external borrowings are within
the competence of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of the Republic of
Uzbekistan, as well as founders of the joint venture.” At the same time, Mr.
Nazhimov provided AGF with further comments on the problems raised by the
hedging provision (Exh. C-240) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 277).

On 18 March 2004, by Letter No. 1325/520, Mr. Tashmuradov, Deputy Chairman
of the Central Bank, sent a letter to AGF, confirming that the HGOA was an
integral part of the Financing Agreement, which had already been registered by
the Central Bank on 9 April 2003 (see above para. 430), and was thus not subject
to the need of a separate registration (Exh. C-241).

On 18 March 2004, Mr. Watts of AGF wrote to Mr. Serikbaev, Deputy Chairman
of the State Customs Committee, requesting the latter to allow the registration of
the HGOA with the Navoi State Regional Customs Committee so as to entitle the
export of the gold (Exh. C-243). However, it seems the Customs verbally refused
to register the HGOA (see reference in Exh. C-244).

Qn 19 March 2004, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of ORC and Oxus wrote to Prime
Minister, Mr. Mirziyoyev, complaining further about the fact that AGF continued
to be refused permission to export gold and concluding as follows (Exh. C-244):

“This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The lending banks will
declare AGF officially in default if the first shipment does not take place
very soon. AGF also cannot operate indefinitely without operating cash
flow. The first gold shipment was supposed to have taken place on 27
February. We are now 3 weeks overdue. There is a very real risk that the
mine will be forced to close.

Somebody must now make a decision in order to resolve this problem. We
understand that a Cabinet of Ministers resolution is being prepared in order
to achieve this, and we urge you to ensure that this resolution is
unambiguous, is an instruction to all relevant parties (including State
Customs), and is issued in good time to allow the first gold to be shipped on
Tuesday, 23 March.”

On 23 March 2004, by Letter No. 04-8/11-785, Mr. Teshaev, Deputy Head of the
State Tax Committee in Navoi region, confirmed to Mr. Watts of AGF that the
HGOA required prior registration with competent State authorities before it could
be recorded by the Customs (Exh. C-242) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 278).

On the same day, Oxus issued a press release stating as follows (Exh. R-730):

“As a consequence of the mine production and gold refining being ahead of
schedule, the registration of the various documents required to obtain the
relevant export permit was unable to keep pace. The partners of AGF (Oxus
Resources Corporation, Uzbekistan’s State Committee of Geology and Navoi
NMMC) have been working diligently to resolve all procedural issues and
Oxus is pleased to confirm that the necessary paperwork has now been
completed and gold revenue will be received well ahead of the due date for
the first loan repayment by AGF.”

Between 26 and 30 March 2004, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus sent further
letters to the CabMin, to the Prime Minister and to the Deputy Prime Minister
pushing for the permission to export the already produced gold (Exhs. C-245 and
C-247) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 280).

By 30 March 2004, according to Claimant, 630 kg of gold had been produced, of
which 425 kg was ready for export (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 280).

On 31 March 2004, AGF should have delivered the second gold shipment to
Standard Bank. However, according to Claimant, because of Respondent’s request
that the HGOA be first registered, AGF also defaulted on this second delivery
obligation thereby breaching again the Financing Agreement (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 272). In addition, Claimant further contends that it was unable
to pay its contractors, BCM and MAED (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 280; Exh.
C-248).

On 1 and 2 April 2004, Oxus signed two further undertakings, as Amended
Guarantee Letters (Exhs. C-249, C-250), restating the principles contemplated in
the Guarantee Letter (see above para. 451), amending however certain terms and
in particular the timing for the various payments to the State (hereinafter
“Amended Guarantee Letters”).

On 6 April 2004, the CabMin issued a ‘Classified Decree No. 213-fm’
(hereinafter “Decree No. 213”) (Exh. R-371). In this Decree, it resolved — among
others — to (i) direct the National Bank for Foreign Economic Relations and the
State Customs Committee to register AGF’s HGOA, and to (ii) grant customs
clearance to AGF to export 263,096 ounces of precious metals at USD 323,35 per

ounce from April 2004 to January 2005, according to the schedule in an annex to
the Decree.

On 7 and 8 April 2004, the National Bank for Foreign Economic Relations and
the State Customs respectively registered the HGOA (Exh. C-225, see official
stamp on the Agreement) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 161; Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para 283).

On 9 April 2004, the first shipment of gold under the HGOA took place.

On 27 April 2004, AGF and Standard Bank further amended the Original Gold
Offtake Agreement (see above para. 432) by entering into a separate ‘Gold
Offtake Agreement No. EX-0001’ (hereinafter “Unhedged Gold Offtake
Agreement”) covering the sale of unhedged gold.

On 12 July 2004, the MinFin and AGF entered into a Special Dividend
Agreement entitled ‘Agreement between the Ministry of Finance of the Republic
of Uzbekistan and Oxus Gold ple On Payments Related to the Sale of a Part of
Gold Produced by Amantaytau Goldfields A.O’ (hereinafter “Special Dividend
Agreement”) (Exh. C-252). This Agreement restated the content of the previous
three Guarantee Letters (see above paras 451 and 461; Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 284). Under this Agreement, full repayment of the ‘Additional Income’, i.e.
the difference between the current world price (London Morning Fixed price) on
the date of sale and the hedged gold price pursuant to the HGOA, had to be made
before 31 October 2008.

1.2 2004-2006 : The Beginning of Operational Challenges and the Special
Dividend Agreement

On 15 September 2004, AGF’s internal Audit Committee issued a Report called
‘Audit’s Committee Conclusion for financial activity of JV “Amantaytau Gold
Fields” for 2003’ (Exh. R-161) (hereinafter “AGF Audit Committee Report
2004”). The Report pointed out certain irregularities, including namely: (i) the
failure to submit ‘financial outcome report’ forms in accordance with applicable
tules, (ii) certain irregularities concerning the payment of invoices to suppliers,
including MAED, in particular the fact that payments were done without
contracts, (iii) the exceeding of the approved JV Budget 2003 of $1.732 million
compared to an actual administered budget of $7.171 million, due mainly to the

468. On 22 October 2004, Oxus issued its Annual Report 2004 (Exh. R-2). As
concerns the Special Dividend Agreement, it reported as follows:

“On 13 March 2004 the company guaranteed to fund an AGF Phase 2
Project Development Fund. This Fund will be paid to the Uzbek Government
by AGF as a licence fee in respect of the transfer to AGF of the underground
shaft and related underground workings at the AGF site, which form an
integral part of the Phase 2 Sulphides project and which are estimated by
the directors to have a value of at least $70 million.

These assets have already been transferred to AGF. The Fund will be
calculated as to the Uzbek Government's share (50%) of the positive
difference between the actual world price of gold on the date of sale and the
hedged gold price pursuant to the Gold Offtake Agreement signed with the
lending banks on 15 April 2003 (as amended on 20 January 2004), subject
to a maximum gold price of $410 per ounce. AGF has hedged 263,096

198

469.

470.

ounces of gold at $323.35 per ounce over the period February 2004 to
January 2006.

The Fund will accrue on a monthly basis from the first date of sale of hedged
gold and the company has committed to transfer the appropriate monies to
the Fund on a quarterly basis over the period February 2006 to May 2008.
At 30 June 2004 the accrued Fund was $1,760,781 (see note 13) and, at a
$400 per ounce gold price, the contingent liability in respect of the period
July 2004 to January 2006 is estimated at $6.6 million.”

On 11 November 2004, AGF held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,
during which the shareholders discussed — among others — AGF’s deficient
extraction rate, as well as its failure to comply with its approved business plan for
2004. It resolved as follows (Exh. R-162):

“3.7 to postpone approval of amendments to the AGF Business plan for
2004 and AGF Business plan for 2005 until the Shareholders examine and
find causes of unexpectedly low rates of gold production for which purpose a
commission to conduct such a study will be appointed. Oxus agreed to
appoint J. MacLochiin, S.L. Salamatin and B. Dzhalolov as members of this
commission, Goskomgeologia agreed to appoint E.L. Popov who is the head
of the mineral raw materials production department and E.M. Hushbokov
who is the chief process engineer of Ingichinskaya OMTE, while Navoi
Mining and Metallurgical Plant agreed to appoint O.A. Mihin, deputy chief
engineer and chief process engineer of Navoi Mining and Metallurgical
Plant as well as Kizimov F.P. who is the chief process engineer of CRU. It
was decided that the commission shall complete its work as soon as possible
so as not to hinder implementation of the AGF plans for 2005.

3.8 to request the management of AGF to submit to the Supervisory Board of
AGF the Rectified business plan for 2004 and Business plan for 2004 for
consideration before the 20th of December 2004 drawn up as per the form
agreed upon with the Shareholders and on the basis of the achieved gold
production rate without regard to expenses for the expansion of production
of oxidized ores up to 1.5 million tons per year but with account of expenses
for construction works at Vysokovoltnoye gold and silver mine and
improvement of the its production rates, find sources of financing of the
d to the construction of V) gold and

silver mine.”

On 2 August 2005, AGF held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (Exh.
C-652), during which the shareholders approved — among others — the annual
accounts and financial reporting, the Business Plan 2005, and the Mining Contract
with NMMC for Vysokovoltnoye. The shareholders further acknowledged that
AGF was not meeting the ore mining, gold recovery and metal production
parameters: although the JV had established a production quota of 6.2 tonnes of
gold and 20 tonnes of silver, AGF expected to produce only 4.98 tonnes of gold
and 8.9 tonnes of silver mentioned in the Business Plan 2005 and therefore

199

471.

472.

473.

474.

instructed amendments to the Business Plan 2006 (see Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 188).

On_16 September 2005, AGF held an Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders, during which the shareholders amended its Business Plan for 2006
to reflect an extraction rate of only 76% and expected production of 4.9 tonnes of
gold and 1.7 tons of silver (Exh. R-167). As concerns the distribution of profit, the
shareholders unanimously resolved as follows:

“5.1 to distribute undistributed profits of AGF accumulated in 2004 as
follows:

- 12.416 million USD to repay loan provided by Standard Bank
- .058 million USD to be contributed to the Reserve fund
- 2.5 million USD to be paid to the Shareholders as payment of dividend

- .081 USD million to be paid to the Members of the Supervisory board as
remuneration.”

On 23 September 2005, Goskomgeology issued to AGF a ‘License ZM N 0007’
(hereinafter “Cyanide License”) (Exh. C-329). It authorized AGF to operate the
production, transportation and storage of cyanide to extract precious metals from
mined ore, including gold and silver. This license was due to expire on 23
September 2010.

On 12 December 2005, Sanoat issued an ‘Expert Conclusion’ (Exh. C-635)
regarding the conditions for obtaining a license on the right of mining precious
metals by AGF. The Conclusion stated as follows:

“~ [AGF] adheres to all requirements of Uzbek legislation on subsoil
and on environmental protection, as well as rules and norms of safety,
workplace protection, sanitary norms and rules, hygiene norms, as
well as State standards;

Led
Expert Conclusion
Led

Experts consider possible to grant [AGF] the license on the right of
mining of precious metals.”

On_ 15 December 2005, Mr. Webbstock on behalf of AGF sent a letter to

Mr. Sultanov, Deputy Prime Minister, requesting the latter to grant the renewal of
AGF’s Mining license (Exh. C-313).

200

475. As of 31 December 2005, Oxus issued a Regulatory News Service press release
(“RNS”) announcing that AGF recorded a $13.263 million gross profit for the
year 2005 and further reported the following highlights (Exh. C-260):

476. On 7 and 12 January 2006, Mr. Webbstock, AGF’s General Director, sent a letter
to Mr. Saidov, Head of Sanoat, to renew its Mining License (Exhs. R-190, R-
191), which was due to expire on 27 November 2006 (see above para. 415).

477.

From 10 to 14 April 2006, Sanoat conducted an Audit of AGF (hereinafter
“Compliance Audit 2006”) and issued a Report (Exh. R-189) raising various
problems (see below para. 484).

201

1.3 2006 : First Interventions by the Uzbek Government

1.3.1 The 2006 Tax Regime Changes

478. On 1 May 2006, the CabMin issued Decree No. 74 ‘On Additional Measures to
Increase the Incentive Role of Privileges Granted to Companies with Foreign
Investments’ (hereinafter “Decree No. 74”) (Exhs. C-255, C-399). It provided as
follows:

“1. It shall be established that:

Taxation of companies with foreign investments registered in the territory of
the Republic of Uzbekistan shall be carried out in accordance with the laws
existing at the time of taxation;

Companies with foreign investments registered in the territory of the
Republic of Uzbekistan shall fully use all general tax and customs privileges
and preferences established by legal deeds, as well as additional privileges
and preferences granted strictly with the procedure and on the terms
envisaged by the laws (including investment agreements, production sharing
agreements).

J. It shall be established that additional privileges on paying taxes,
customs and other compulsory payments shall be granted to companies
with foreign investments only for a clearly defined term and cannot be
without time limit.

2. from June 1, 2006, all privileges on paying taxes, customs and other
compulsory payments earlier granted by Government resolutions which
have not been envisaged by legal documents and which are without time
limit shall be cancelled.

3. In order to secure detailed consideration of issues of necessity and
efficiency of further granting of additional privileges and preferences to
existing companies with foreign investments which are a part of an
industry or are implementing projects recognised by laws as priority
projects, a special group shall be created including members in
accordance with the Appendix and this group shall be instructed as
follows:

All aspects of appeals of individual companies with foreign investments,
which were granted additional privileges on paying taxes, duties, customs
and other compulsory payments without time limit by earlier Government
resolutions shall be considered;

Based on the results of consideration of appeals relevant substantiated
proposals on setting up for individual companies with foreign investments,
which earlier had privileges without time limit, of substantiated privileges on

defined term followed by further conclusion of investment agreements with
foreign investors with the procedure set up by Resolution of the Cabinet of

Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan # 180 dated 2 August 2005 On
Measures To Implement Decree of the President of the Republic of
Uzbekistan On Additional Incentive Measures To Attract Direct Private
Foreign Investments shall be introduced to the Cabinet of Ministers. [...]”

On 7 July 2006, the CabMin issued Decree No. 133 ‘On Entering of Amendments
and Invalidations of Some Resolutions of the Government of the Republic of
Uzbekistan’ (hereinafter “Decree No. 133”) (Exhs. C-256/R-375). It invalidated
the following previous decrees: (i) Clauses 5 to 7 of Decree No. 477 (see above
para. 39) and (ii) Clauses 6 and 7 of Decree No. 266 (see above para. 53).
According to Claimant, it also revoked AGF’s exemption from the mandatory
procedure for surrendering foreign currency revenues to an authorized bank in the
Republic of Uzbekistan in exchange for Uzbek soums (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 212; Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 14 fol.).

On 22 September 2006, Mr. Norton of AGF wrote to the Minister of Economy
and “Head of the Special Working Group” on “Issue related to Granting
Privileges to the Companies with Foreign Investments”, to complain about the
consequences on AGF of Decree No. 74 and No. 133 (C-257). According to
Claimant, the net effect of these Decrees meant a USD 43 million increase in
costs between 2006 and 2007 (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 297).

On _ 22 September _2006, a meeting was held between Mr. Hill and the tax
authorities, but no agreement was reached (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 306;
Hill-WS 31.08.2012, para. 46).

The 2006 Audits

On 11 July 2006, representatives of the State Tax Committee arrived at AGF to
conduct a further Audit to verify AGF’s compliance with the tax, currency and
customs law (hereinafter “Complex Audit 2006”) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013,
para. 216; Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 300).

On 27 July 2006, while the Complex Audit 2006 was still ongoing, Oxus entered
into a contract with JNR Limited (hereinafter “JNR”), an offshore investment
advisory company owned by Jacob and Nathaniel Rotschild (see reference thereto
in Exh. C-58).

On 18 August 2006, the State Tax Committee and the State Customs Committee
issued its audit report (hereinafter “Complex Audit Report 2006”) (Exh. R-472) as
well as an ‘Act of Inspection regarding Issues Of Observance Of The Tax
Legislation And Other Legislative Acts in “AMANTAYTAU GOLDFIELDS”
Closed Joint Stock Company’ (hereinafter “Inspection Act”) (Exh. C-268).

203

485.

486.

487.

488.

According to such Report and Inspection Act, AGF was liable for various non-
compliances, including — among others — the following: (i) absence of an annual
safety knowledge assessment schedule for the managers and specialists of the SP,
(ii) technological deficiencies and violations of the technological regime which do
not allow it to reach the scheduled gold recovery rate of 86%, (iii) non-
compliance with the requirements of relevant regulations regarding the
commercial gold and silver recovery rate, (iv) further technical and accounting
non-compliances, in particular with tax, customs and other regulations. This
triggered fines and penalties totalling the substantial amount of approx. USD 225
million.

On 25 August 2006, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus sent a letter to Mr. Azimov,
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, complaining about the way in
which the Complex Audit 2006 had been conducted as well as its findings, and
requesting to delay the execution of the tax audit provisions (Exh. C-269).

On 6 September 2006, Mr. Hill, AGF’s General Director, sent to Mr. Teshayev,
Chief of the Regional Tax Inspectorate, a letter objecting to the conclusions of the
Complex Audit Report 2006, in particular with regard to (i) the withholding tax,
(ii) the school tax, (iii) the environmental tax for 2005, (iv) the VAT for imported
goods and services, and (v) the single tax from the gross revenue (Exh. C-270).
Mr. Hill concluded that “[b]y wrong actions the _ inspectors
deliberately/“artificially” increased the number of items to be imposed by tax and
have additionally calculated the tax.”

On 7 September 2006, the State Tax Inspectorate of Zarafshan City commenced
enforcement proceedings in the Navoi Economic Court against AGF for non-
payment of due taxes (Exh. R-473) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 305).

On 13 September 2006, Mr. Narziev, AGF’s chief accountant, notified Messrs
Hill, Suter, Wilkins, Kipps and Boyjigitov that, as stressed in the Central Bank
Letter No. 1308/1062 dated 3 May 2000 (see above para. 50), it was strictly
forbidden for AGF to make payments from its Barclays Bank account under
import contracts, and from receiving into that account foreign currency revenue
from its export activities (Exh. R-176). Mr. Narziev issued the following
recommendation:

“Based on above stated, I ask you to stop transferring the receipt of revenue
in foreign currency to Barclays Bank in London. To provide performance of
laws of RUz about currency regulation. To change bank details in the
contract with Standard Bank about sale of gold.

Otherwise the State authority will suspend the shipment of finished product.”

493.

On 19 September 2006, Mr Hill, AGF’s General Director, sent a letter to Mr.
Azimov, Deputy Prime Minister, requesting again the delay of enforcement of the
tax and custom Audit provisions and enforcement actions so as to allow AGF to
continue its operations (Exh. C-271).

On 26 September 2006, Mr. Hill of AGF wrote to Mr. Azimov, Deputy Prime
Minister, requesting that the execution of the collection order of the Navoi
Regional State Customs Department be suspended until 1 November 2006 (Exh.
C-476).

On 18 October 2006, the Navoi Regional Economic Court issued collection orders
on AGF’s bank accounts, finished products (i.e. refined silver and gold) and fixed
assets (Exh. R-652). According to Claimant, these orders were issued without
informing AGF, let alone allowing it an opportunity to contest or challenge them
(Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 307).

On 26 October 2006, the Navoi Regional Economic Court rendered a ‘Decision’
(Case No. 21-06-06/5481) on the State Tax Inspectorate’s claims, confirming the
latter’s finding of liability for approx. USD 225 million (Exh. C-273).

On _27 October 2006, Oxus, as a listed company, issued a RNS making the
following announcement regarding the Navoi court decision (Exh. C-274):

“Oxus [...] announces that the Regional Economic Court of the Navoi
province in Uzbekistan issued a ruling against Amantaytau Goldfields
(AGF’) Oxus’ subsidiary in Uzbekistan on 26 October 2006 claiming taxes
of $15.3 million relating to the period of 1 January 2003 to 31 December
2005, plus related fines and penalties equivalent to $4.9 million. This
amount includes $7.1 million of recoverable VAT. AGF is 50% owned by
Oxus Gold and 50 by the Uzbek State.

In addition the ruling also claims $203.6 million in respect of alleged
transgressions during the same period relating to the operation of AGF’s
overseas foreign currency bank account. The ruling becomes effective after
30 days unless overturned. AGF is appealing the majority of this ruling.
AGF has been led to believe that any liabilities resulting from the rulings
will be payable pursuant to a reasonable payment schedule.

AGF believes it was exempt from the majority of taxes claimed under the
ruling.

AGF also maintains that it was authorized by decree of the Cabinet of
Ministers to operate an overseas bank account and that such operations
were conducted legitimately and with the full knowledge of the relevant
Uzbek authorities, including the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to
which AGF regularly submitted the required reports.”

205

According to Claimant, this announcement together with the revocation of
AGF’s tax privileges and the 2006 Audit caused Oxus’ share price to drop
sharply, from nearly GDP 0.80 per share at the beginning of 2006, to below
GBP 0.10 (Exhs. C-275-C-276) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 311).

494. On 3 and 28 November 2006, Mr. Hill, AGF’s General Director, sent two letters,
the first one to Messrs Azimov (First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Finance) and Parpiev and Teshayev (Tax Department), the second one to Gorlov
(Deputy and Acting Chairman of Goskomgeology), Yuldashev (Chief of Hard
Curency & Economic Development Department of Ministry of Finance),
Shemetov (Chief Engineer of NMMC) and various people at Oxus and ORC
including Messrs Trew, Wilkins and Kipps, in which he complained about the
difficulties for AGF to survive, identifying following issues as “critical” and
requesting assistance (Exh. C-272 and C-279):

“1. Supply of diesel fuel — payments necessary
2. Payments to local service providers
3. Payment to Navoielectroset — Electrical supply to Karakata pump station

4. Agreement with NMB to mine Centralny and using current loan to NMB
as financing

5. Payment of salaries for the month of October

6. Removal of Court Arrests;

a. On sales of Product

b. On bank accounts

7. Lifting of customs claim for historical duties, (pre-June 2006)

8. Agreement on repayment schedules for current tax and customs, (post
June 2006), including off-set of VAT paid to date

9. Agreement on return to original tax/customs regime or postponement of
implementation of cancellation of privileges (from June 2006) until such
time as new privileges can be agreed that do not force AGF into a loss-
making operation

10. Resolution of dor{é] refining contract with AMMC or permission to
export dor{é] product

11, Agreement with Zarafshan-Newmont on smelting of silver concentrate

12. GMZ-2 to agree to refining of gold dor\é] ,including high silver content
(up to 30%), as per contract

13. Mining Operations Licence to be renewed.”

498.

In December 2006, AGF appealed the ‘Decision in Case No. 21-06-06/5481’ of
the Navoi Regional Economic Court, which had confirmed the finding of the 2006
Audit (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 321).

On 28 December 2006, the Board of Appeal of the Navoi Regional Economic
Court issued its ‘Decree of Appeals Instance of the Economic Court of Navoi
Oblast Case No. 21-06-06/5481’ partially upholding and partially reversing the
Court’s previous decision on enforcing the findings of the Complex Audit Report
2006 (see above para. 484) (Exh. R-477) as follows:

“(The Court] HAS RESOLVED:

1. To change the Decision of the Economic Court of 26.10.2006.

2. To apply financial sanctions to Amantaytau Goldfields ZAO JV in the
amount of 16,954,600 soums.

3. To refuse to apply financial sanctions to Amantaytau Goldfields ZAO JV
in the amount of 250,984,596,400 soums.

4. To leave without consideration claims regarding collection of
additionally calculated taxes and compulsory payment and fines for
delay in payment.

5. To leave the Ruling of the Economic Court of Navoi oblast of 18.10.2006
without changes and to leave the Appeal without satisfaction.”

On 15 February 2007, the State Tax Inspectorate appealed to the Economic Court
against the decision of the Board of Appeals of the Navoi Economic Court before
the Navoi Superior Economic Court and further before the Cassational Instance of
the Uzbek Superior Economic Courts. Both Courts upheld the decision of the
Board of Appeals and of the lower court by decisions of 27 March and 12 April
2007 respectively (both in Exh. R-478).

The Expiry of the Mining License

On 30 October 2006, an Extraordinary Meeting of the AGF Supervisory Board
took place (Exh. R-1128). During this Meeting, the issue of the renewal of the
Mining License was discussed and it was stressed that four items remained
unfulfilled from the 49 items specified in the Inspection Act (see above para.
484), namely:

207

499.

500.

501.

502.

503.

- Non-performance of laboratory certification (it was guaranteed to
be performed in the beginning of December 2006);

- Failure to employ a control instrumentation engineer for tools
calibration;

- Failure to fill a technical certificate for mounted equipment;

- Non construction of weight bridge.

On 23 November 2006, i.e. four days before the expiry date of AGF’s Mining
License (see above paras. 415, 474, 476) and eleven months after its application,
Mr. Hill sent a letter to Mr. Saidov, the Head of Sanoat, to require assistance
regarding the renewal of AGF’s Mining License (Exh. C-314) (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 353).

On 24 November 2006, by Letter No. 14-912, Mr. Saidov, the Head of Sanoat,
responded to Mr. Hill of AGF (Exh. C-315), indicating that the renewal of AGF’s
Mining License was under review and that pending this review, AGF could
continue its activities under the license until 28 December 2006.

On 30 November 2006, Oxus signed a ‘Share Subscription Agreement’ with
Zeromax, under which Zeromax acquired a 16% stake in Oxus at GBP 0.21 per
share and the right to appoint a non-executive director to the Oxus Board (Exh. C-
54).

On 18 December 2006, Mr. Hill on behalf of AGF sent a Letter No. 1594 to Mr.
Saidov from Sanoat (Exh. R-202). He requested that, in view of the expiry of the
additional time period granted until 28 December 2006 (see above para. 500), the
Mining license be further extended pursuant to Article 20 of the Law "On
Licensing Certain Activities."

On 27 December 2006, by Letter No. 14-1003, Mr. Alibaev from Sanoat sent a
letter to Mr. Hill from AGF stating that AGF was permitted to continue its mining
activities on the basis of its expired mining-activity license, without indicating the
duration of such permission or the time it would take to decide on the renewal
(Exh. C-316).

1.4 2006-2010 : The Arising of Operational and Financial Problems

The Challenges Regarding the Refining of Silver

On 23 January 2006, upon Mr. Akhmedov of Goskomgeology’s request of 19
January 2006, Mr. Mamadaliyen on behalf of Mr. Sultanov, Deputy Prime
Minister, issued an ‘Order No. 06/22-2’ to AMGK directing it to expand its silver
refinery to be able to process the silver doré from AGF (Exhs. R-100, 101) (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 252).

On 13 February 2006, AMGK informed AGF that it would have the capacity to
refine up to 5,000 kg of silver doré per month, beginning in May 2006 (see
reference to this communication in Exh. C-286).

On 28 February 2006, Mr. Norton from AGF wrote to Mr. Bill (William) Trew
from Oxus, Mrs Sherbakova from the MinFin, Mr. Akhmedov from
Goskomgeology and Mr. Kuchersky from NMMC, objecting to AGMK’s
proposal and noting that AGF had already conducted a tender for the silver
refining and intended to work with Metalor, “due to numerous reasons including
legislation in Russia and Kazakhstan restricting off-take agreements and also
Metalor’s better understanding of the permitting and shipping processes in
Uzbekistan.” According to AGF’s assessment, the costs of silver refining through
AMGK would be almost three times more expensive than with Metalor (i.e. USD
4,179,412 compared to USD 1,588,867 for 3,454,060 Oz) (Exh. C-286) (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 252). In addition, Mr. Norton expressed doubts as to
AGMK’s capacity to refine all the silver doré given that the monthly production
forecast for 2006 would exceed 5,000 kg.

On _ 29 March 2007, AGF and AMGK entered into ‘Agreement No. 14-780’
(hereinafter “Silver Refining Agreement”) regarding the refining by AMGK of
AGF’s silver doré (Exh. C-288). Under Clause 2.1.1 of the Agreement, AGF was
required to supply precious metal doré bars in the form of anodes to AMGK,
together with “a passport specifying the number and weight of precious metal
dor[é] bars and assay results for precious metals and impurities” in each bar. As
concerns the quality requirement of the silver doré bars, Clause 2.1.2 provided in
particular as follows:

“2.1.2 Acceptance of precious metals dor|é] bars in the form of anodes shall
be carried out at the Processor’ s Refinery with subsequent formalization of
a delivery- acceptance certificate.

The quality of the dor{é] bars shall be similar to the quality data provided in
Appendix 2 to this Agreement.

209

The amount stated in the delivery-acceptance certificate shall be regarded
as final and mandatory for both Parties The Processor shall weigh, sample
and carry out a chemical assay of supplied precious metal dor{é] bars in the
form of anodes with a view to their compliance with the passport data).

In case of discrepancy between the data, the data obtained at the Processor
shall be accepted and a conciliation certificate shall be signed.”

508. On 21 May 2007, AGF and AMGK entered into a ‘Supplemental Agreement No.

J to the Silver Refining Agreement’, by further specifying the weight of the doré
bars to be supplied by AGF, the procedure for receiving precious metals doré bars
and penalties in case these weight parameters were not complied with (Exh. C-
289) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 255):

“Clause 2.1.1 shall be added as follows:

The surface of the precious metal dor{é] bars in the form of anodes should be sharp
flashless and free of contaminating (slag) impurities.

Each precious metal dor{é] bar should weight not more than 30 kg.

Each shipment of the precious metal dor|é] bars in the form of anodes should consist
of the same fusion alloy but not less than 90 kg. (Suppl. Agreement #1 dated
21.05.2007).

Clause 2.1.2 shall be added as follows :

At the following content of precious metals in dor[é] bars :
- less than 1% gold recovery shall be 98.8% ;

- less than 74% silver recovery shall be 95.8%.
Clause 3.2 shall be added as follows:

As agreed between the Parties, supplies of precious metal dor{é] bars weighing more
than 30 kg shall be admissible. The admissible variance for the dor|é| bar weight
shall be +/- 10 grammes.

Clause 4.1 shall be added as follows:
In case of breach of Cl. 2.1.1. and 2.1.2. of the Contract resulting in additional work,

the PROCESSOR shall present demands for additional costs based on calculations
coordinated with the SUPPLIER.”

509. On 1 June 2007, AGF and Standard Bank entered into a ‘Silver Offtake

510.

o

Agreement No. Ex-0004’ (hereinafter “Silver Offtake Agreement”), providing for
the sale of 2,500,000 troy ounces of silver from AGF to the bank at USD 4,75 per
ounce, i.e. a total of nearly USD 32 million (Exh. C-290) (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 331).

On 8, 12, 15 June and 8 July 2007, Mr. Dabizha of AMGK wrote again several
letters to Mr. Ynusov of AGF complaining about alleged breaches by AGF of the
required parameters regarding the weight of the supplied doré bars and/or relevant
documentation (Exhs. R-107 to R-110) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 255).

In August_and September 2007, Mr. Dabizha of AMGK wrote several letters to
Mr. Ynusov of AGF complaining about the weight quality of the delivered doré
bars (Exhs. R-112 to R-114).

On 19 July 2007, AGMK and AGF entered into the ‘Supplemental Agreement
No. 2 to the Silver Refining Agreement’ (Exh. R-111), in which AGMK and
AGF agreed that, if AGF failed to submit the results of assays, it would pay
AGMK for conducting these assays on its behalf.

On 14 November 2007, Mr. Wilkins, Director of Oxus, wrote to Mr. Azimov,
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, to complain about the fact that
AGF had a stockpile of silver doré worth approx. USD 17,5 million, which could
not be processed because of AMGK’s limited processing capacity. Consequently,
Mr. Wilkins requested that the MinFin allow Oxus’ outstanding liability under the
Special Dividend Agreement to be met with the stockpiled unrefined silver (Exhs.
C-291/R-882).

On 30 November 2007, Mr. Bekenov, Deputy Minister of Finance, replied to Mr.
Wilkins’ letter of 14 November 2007 rejecting its request (Exh. C-292).

On 16 February 2008, Mr. Khaspoladov and other representatives of AMGK met
with representatives of the CabMin, Goskomgeology and AGF to discuss the
problems regarding the silver refining (Exh. R-115). During this Meeting, the
parties agreed that “[t]he main reasons for increasing of the timing for refining of
AGMK silver and gold dor{é] bars is the increase of silver to gold ratio up to 20:1
from the designed ratio of 8:1, breaching of this ratio leads to increasing volumes
of turnover materials which require additional processing time” and made the
following decisions:

“1.To consider variants of supplementary agreement conclusion between JV
“Amantaytau Goldfields” and “Almalyk MMC”, OJSC over the period till
March 1, 2008, which stipulates:

- minimum content of gold and silver in a supplied alloy
- gold and silver recovery ratio
- affining metals return term

2. Take note of the approved return schedule of the supplied 16,783.1 kg of
alloy “dor{é]” as well as AMMC is able to process not more than 10,000 kg

make it possible to process not more than 26,783 kg of alloy “dor{é]” of the
supplied quality in 2008. Thereby 58,936 kg of the alloy “dor{é]” is to be
affined on the other refinery for plan execution in number 32,153 kg.

As concerns item 7, the Minutes of Meetings provided as follows:

“7. Proposals for construction of a silver refinery

The Chairman gave floor to Mr Hill who informed the Meeting that due to
inability of AMMC to meet their obligations on the refining agreement which
leads to delays in silver exports and sales the Company had considered an
option of building its own refinery. Such construction will allow refining its
product in the full amount and within established terms. But as the refinery
initially won't have a 'good delivery status' (it takes a lot of time to obtain it)
silver bullion will have to be re-refined and/or re-stamped at AMMC or
another refinery for the purposes of Good Delivery Status.

The current requirement of the Company in refining capacity is 3 tonnes per
month but if the Company receives a license to mine Kosmanachi and
Okjetpes silver deposits then construction of a refinery with the capacity 5 t
per month. The cost of construction of a 5 t refinery is US$3 million.

Having voted the General Meeting unanimously AGREED as follows:

7.1. The Company's proposal to build its own refinery shall be supported
provided this issue has been agreed with the Cabinet of Ministers of the
Republic of Uzbekistan.”

517. On 11 June 2008, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus sent a letter to Mr. Turnusov,
Deputy Minister of Finance, regarding various issues, including the repayment of
the debt under the Special Dividend Agreement, VAT reimbursement and the
problems relating to the export of silver doré bars (Exh. R-884):

“Oxus respectfully requests once again that the Ministry of Finance take
appropriate measures with the relevant State organisations to allow AGF to
recover the overdue VAT. Oxus also requests that the Ministry of Finance
consults with the Uzbek Government to allow AGF to make a one-off
shipment of doré silver to an overseas refinery in order to clear the stockpile
at Almalyk. The successful resolution of either of these matters will enable
AGF to repay Oxus and then Oxus to pay the Ministry of Finance.

Until these matters are resolved, Oxus believes it is in the best interest of all
the founders that it continues to use its cash to support and grow the
business of AGF.

We trust that you understand the position that we find ourselves in. We
acknowledge our liability to the Ministry of Finance and confirm that we too
wish to see it cleared as soon as possible. For the avoidance of doubt the
proposal that we set out in our letter dated 6 May 2008 envisaged Oxus
waiving approximately $5million of shareholder loans due to it from AGF,
and asking AGF to pay this amount instead into the special dividend
account. Thus Oxus is effectively using its own cash, since the shareholder
loan will have been reduced by $5 million without Oxus receiving the
payment. The proposal then envisaged AGF either offsetting this amount
against the VAT due, or coming to an arrangement whereby the VAT is paid
and AGF immediately returns it via the special dividend account.

213

518.

519.

In the light of the above, and at this important time for the financing of the
future of AGF, we respectfully ask that you reconsider your response dated 3
June. For our part, we remain committed to finding a solution to this issue,
and to developing AGF for the benefit of all its founders.”

On 29 September 2008, AGF held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,
during which the purchase of an overseas silver refinery for construction and
operation in Uzbekistan was further discussed (Exh. C-296). The Minutes of the
Meeting provide as follows regarding the shareholders’ decision:

“Having voted the General Meeting of Shareholders unanimously adopted
the following RESOLUTION:

9.1. Construction of the silver refinery shall be considered after the financial
situation at AGF is stabilized and shall be at AGF's own expense.

9.2. AGF management shall continue negotiations with AMMC to agree
terms for processing of silver and gold dor[é] at AMMC.”

These Minutes were duly signed by the shareholders, although Claimant contends
that Mr. Wilkins signed them “purely out of need to keep the Project moving
forward and so as to not create even further hurdles to the joint venture’s smooth
operation over and above Respondent’s numerous hostile acts to that point.”
(Wilkins II, para. 76; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 874).

On 21 November 2008, AGF and AMGK entered into the ‘Supplemental
Agreement No. 4’ to the Silver Refining Agreement (Exh. C-298). According to
this Agreement, the Parties further refined the provision relating to the weight and
quality of precious metal as follows:

“Clause 2.1.2 shall be added:

The sum of precious metals in Dor[é] bar shall not be less than 96%.
Clause 2.2.2 shall be amended as follows:

At the following contents of precious metals in Dor[é] bars:

- gold 1% and above 1% - the recovery shall be 97,33% -

- gold less than 1% - the recovery shall be 97,0%

- silver 90% and above 90% - the recovery shall be 92,51%
Clause 2.2.4 shall be amended as follows:

The “Processor” shall return refined metal to the “Supplier” not later
than 120 days from the date when the Dor[é| was received for
refining.- 120 kg of gold and 1765 kg of silver received in Dor[é] for
refining in 2007 and now being locked in the “passive part” of

214

520.

521.

522.

523.

unfinished process will be returned in 90 days after completion of
refurbishment of reverberating furnace. Approximate date of
refurbishment — April 2009.
Clause 3.2 shall be added:

The “Supplier” shall take measures to maximum reduce content of
impurities, in particular of:

Zinc — not more than 0,04%

Selenium — not more than 0,05%

Bismuth — not more than 0,008%

Nickel — not more than 0,008%”

On 21 and 29 April 2009, Mr. Wilkins of Oxus sent letters to Prime Minister
Mirziyoyev and Mr. Turdimov, Khokim of Navoi Region (Exhs. C-305/C-306).
Oxus requested the right to make a one-off export of silver doré to be refined by
Metalor in Switzerland in order to “enable AGF to pay its current creditors, re-
employ the workforce, and re-commence operations” (Exh. C-305). According to
Mr. Wilkins’ letter, the Uzbek Government had in principle already agreed during
the Meeting of 2 March 2009 (see below para. 572) that the silver doré be
exported for the purpose of being refined, subject to the submission of all relevant
documentation. However, according to Mr. Hill, the Uzbek Government
nevertheless requested that Oxus comply with Uzbek law and organize a tender
process (Hill-WS 31.08.2012, para. 86; Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 341; Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 261).

In June 2009, AGF entered into a ‘Silver Doré Refining and Refined Silver and
Gold Offtake Agreement No. Ex-0003’ with Metalor of Switzerland (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 341; Exh. C-308).

On 2 June 2009, a Meeting was held between government agencies, including also
Deputy Prime Minister Shoismatov, Goskomgeology represented by
Mr. Mavlyanov and Mr. Mukhamedov, as well as AGF and Oxus representatives,
including Mr. Hill. During this Meeting, the Government allegedly informed
Claimant that, in order to award a tender to an overseas refinery, it would be
necessary to follow a complex process of gathering proposals, adjudication with
the other two AGF shareholders and contract negotiation with the successful
bidder, which would take several months (Exhs. C-310/C-682) (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 343).

On 22 July 2009, AGF and AMGK entered in to the ‘Supplemental Agreement
No. 5 to the Silver Refining Agreement’ (Exh. C-311). According to this
Agreement, the silver doré bars should in future be delivered in the form of

215

524.

525.

526.

“anodes” subject to specific maximum levels of impurities. According to
Respondent, this Agreement was necessary because Claimant failed to meet the
parameters set out in Supplemental Agreement No. 4, as concerned the level of
impurities of the silver doré bars (see above para. 519). In this latest Agreement,
the permissible levels of impurities were amended in the hope to resolve this
problem. Thereafter, refining of the AGF’s silver stockpile resumed.

On 13 October 2009, Mr. Dabizha, Chief Engineer at AGMK, sent a letter to Mr.
Hill of AGF, copying Mr. Mavlyanov, Chairman of Goskomgeology, complaining
about technological difficulties with regard to the silver refining (Exh. R-120).
Mr. Dabizha stated in particular as follows:

“[...] The quality of the refined silver produced with the anodes does not
confirm the "Good Delivery" status LBMA and the complex cannot mark the
bars. That is why it turned out to be necessary to perform additional refining
of the metal in the reverberatory furnace and to form anodes for further
refining of precious metals. As a result, the expenses of the complex will
grow, the amount of the produced silver will decrease and the terms for the
delivery of the finished product will become longer.

Moreover, for the further electrolysis of the silver and the preparation of a
new electrolyte the complex will need additional material with the content of
impurities specified in appendix No.2 to addendum No.5. [...]”

On_17 November 2009, AMGK and AGF entered in to the ‘Supplemental
Agreements No. 6 and No. 7’ to the Silver Refining Agreement (Exhs. R-121/R-
122).

On 24 December 2009, Mr. Dabizha, Chief Engineer of AGMK, sent a letter to
Mr. Hill of AGF complaining again about AGF’s failure to meet the requirements
as to the property of the silver doré bars to be refined by AGMK (Exh. R-124). In
his letter, Mr. Dabizha stated in particular as follows:

“[...] During the processing of the fifth consignment of anodes we faced
technological difficulties again, as one third of the total number of anodes
had violations in terms of impurities content: in terms of selenium,
according to the contract - not more than 0.2 %, in fact- 0.24-0.39 %o(four
casts);

in terms of copper, according to the contract - not more than 0.2 %, in fact -
0.24% (one cast); in terms of bismuth, according to the contract- not more
than 0.025 %, in fact- 0.058% (one cast). During the processing of such
anodes the selenium concentration in the electrolyte increased up to 71
mg/l, as a result the purity of the metal in the cathode silver and,
consequently, in the produced bars decreased. Thus, like in the case with the
fourth consignment of anodes, it turned out to be necessary to additionally

216

527.

528.

1.4.2

529.

530.

531.

532.

refine 900 kg of metal in the reverberatory furnace and to use anodes for
further silver refining.”

On 26 March 2010, Mr. Dabizha, Chief Engineer of AMGK, sent further letters to
Mr. Hill of AGF, complaining again about the deficient purity of the silver
delivered by AGF for refining (Exh. R-126).

On 30 March 2010, AMGK and AGF entered into the ‘Supplemental Agreement
No. 8’ to the Silver Refining Agreement (Exh. R-127).

The Challenges in the Preparation of the Feasibility Study Necessary to
Acquire Relevant Licenses and the Halt of the Gold Processing
Activities

On 17 April 2006, AGF submitted a Preliminary Feasibility Study for Phase 2
(hereinafter “Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility Study”) of the AGF Project for
review by UzGeotechliti in order for the latter to “carry out the [Preliminary
Feasibility Study]” in accordance with the requirements of Uzbek Law. This
Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibilty Study would then be submitted for approval to the
relevant State bodies (see references in Exh. C-687).

On 10 August 2006, UzGeotechliti returned the Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility
Sudy to AGF, which obtained the Technical Instruction from the Cabinet of
Ministers on 5 September 2006, and could thus proceed with submitting the Study
to the relevant State bodies for approval (see references in Exh. C-687).

On 7 June 2007, the President of Uzbekistan issued Presidential Decree No. PP-
649 ‘On Measures to Improve Procedures for Issuing Subsoil Licenses’
(hereinafter “Decree No. PP-649”) (Exhs. C-321/R-133), which established a new
mining license regime. Under this new regime, entities with existing rights were
required to re-register their existing license and Goskomgeology was appointed as
the entity in charge of ensuring the re-registration and delivering relevant licenses
(Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 358; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 266).

On the same day, the CabMin issued Decree No. 110 ‘On Approval of the
Regulations on the Procedure for Development, Expertise and Approval of the
Documentation on Investment Projects’ (hereinafter “Decree No. 110”) (Exhs. C-
337/R-236). It established new standards regarding the submission of ‘Pre-project
documentation’, including ‘Pre-feasibility study or pre-feasibility calculation’ and
a ‘Final feasibility study or feasibility calculation’. According to Decree No. 110,
the applicant to an investment project had to provide first a Preliminary Feasibility
Study (see Article 3 of Annex 1 of Decree No. 110), and upon its approval, a
Final Feasibility Study (see Article 4 of Annex 1 of Decree No. 11).

217

533.

534.

On 27 June 2007, the Ministry of Economy sent Letter No. 3-1/7-345 to
Goskomgeology providing comments on the Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility
Study and requesting that AGF provide additional information.

On 7 August 2007, Goskomgeology issued five subsoil licenses to AGF (Exhs. R-
135, 136, 137, 139 [extraction] and C-323 [exploration]). Four of these licenses
(“Extraction Licenses”) granted AGF the right to use the subsoil and extract gold
and/or silver for five years in order to develop mineral products at Amantaytau
Centralny, Uzunbulak, Vysokovoltnoye and Nugqrakon, and the fifth license,
which renewed AGF’s Exploration License (“Renewed Exploration License”)
(see above para. 41), granted AGF the right to use the subsoil for three years, i.e.
until 7 August 2010, to perform geological exploration works within the AGF
Project area.

Each of these licenses contained a series of requirements to be fulfilled by AGF.

As concerns the Extraction Licenses, they provided as follows:

“The holder of the license for use of the subsoil block for extraction of
mineral resources from Vyssokovoltnoye field shall:

comply with requirements of Articles 33, 35, 37, 40, 43, 44, 45 and 50
of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan on the Subsoil, the
environmental laws of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the laws of the
Republic of Uzbekistan on water and water use, as well as other
regulatory acts relevant to the geological exploration, use and
protection of the subsoil.

before February I of every calendar year, duly submit to the State
Geological Fund of the State Committee for Geology and Mineral
Resources of the Republic of Uzbekistan information on status and
changes in mineral resources (i. e. a SGR report).

by August 7, 2008, prepare and submit to the State Committee for
Geology and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Uzbekistan duly
approved Report on the Feasibility Study of Development of
Vyssokovoltnoye Gold and Silver Field (in respect of residual
resources), whereupon the terms and conditions of use of the subsoil
block will be revised. [...]” (Exh. R-137, see also similar wording in
Exhs. R-135, 137 and 139)

Similarly to the Extraction License, the Renewed Exploration License also
provided for obligations of the Licensee, including in particular:

“Lod

218

535.

1.2 To meet the requirements established by Articles 11, 12, 16, 33,
35, 36, 40, 43, 45, 50 of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan "On
mineral resources (subsoil)”, legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan
on nature protection, on water and water- consumption, other legal
documents in the field of geologic research, use and protection of
mineral resources.

1.3. To provide production of exploration works on the action space of
the JV Amantaytau Goldfields {Project Territory) in a_ strict
compliance with the current regulations and standards of geologic
exploration of mineral resources.

1.4. On completion of the field works to bring the surface mining
developments and holes, subject for further use in mining the
minerals, into the state, providing life safety and health safety of the
population, environment, as well as to eliminate mine openings and
holes which are not subject for further use.

1.5. In positive results of geologic exploration works to provide
preparation of the report with calculation of gold/silver resources on
the action space of the JV Amantaytau Goldfields (Project territory)
and submitting for consideration and approval to the State committee
for mineral resources under the state Committee of the Republic of
Uzbekistan on geology and mineral resources (further SCG) upon
expiration of the three-year period from the date of the stare
registration of the right to use the subsoil lots”.

According to Claimant, this document was backdated and actually only issued
to Claimant in January 2009 (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 362), after
Claimant requested its renewal in April 2008 (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para.
362). According to Respondent, Claimant’s assertion is baseless (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 266).

On 30 October 2007, Mr. Polikashin sent an email to Mr. Hill, Mr. Wilkins
amongst others, listing current problems that the AGF faces which had serious
implications (Exh. R-1055). These were:

The offshore bank account, which was the biggest issue;

Overseas insurance, as it did not comply with Uzbek law which required it to
obtain insurance via a partner in Uzbekistan;

The Vysokovoltnoy Project was running without a State Acceptance
Certificate due to non-completion of documentation;

219

536.

537.

538.

539.

Import contracts with ABN AMRO, which had been paid via Barclay’s Bank
and therefore, it was difficult to deregister them with ABN AMRO;

Non-payment of taxes on the contract with BCM;
Payment of salaries from offshore bank account;
Non-approval of MAED contract by shareholders, as required by Uzbek law;

Non-registration with the Central Bank of the supplemental agreement
between AGF, Standard Bank and Oxus;

Overpayments on the contract with MRT and lack of invoices on contracts
with Oxus Gold, ORC and Oxus Services Ltd.

At some point before fall 2007, the Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility Study was
submitted to the relevant State bodies; it is unclear when exactly, though indirect
references in various documents indicate that this would have happened around
summer or autumn 2007 (see e.g. Exh. R-660 referring to 3 June 2007 and Exh.
C-687 indicating a period posterior to this exhibit, i.e. September 2007).

On 21 September 2007 and_27 November 2007, the Ministry of Economy
provided further comments on the Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility Study to
Goskomgeology (Exh. R-660 and R-312). Claimant contests having ever received
these comments (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 939).

 

On 5 December 2007, the Deputy Prime Minister approved Claimant’s Phase 2
Preliminary Feasibility Study for the development of the gold-sulphide ore in
Amantaytau (Exh. R-231). This approval covered the main economic and
technical parameters of the Study, including the total value of the Project of USD
161,391,000, the equipment costs of USD 80,726,000, the costs for construction
and assembly works of USD 51,271,000, the miscellaneous costs of USD
17,229,000, the financing costs of USD 12,165,000 as well as the cost of the
existing fixed assets of USD 2,856,000. The approval letter further mentioned in a
Note, that “[flinal engineering and economic indicators of the project will be
adjusted by results of tenders.”""

On 6 December 2007, Oxus issued a Press Release (Exh. C-331) stating as
follows:

“Oxus Gold ple ("Oxus" or the "Company") (OXS.L) is pleased to
announce that [AGF], its 50% owned joint venture company, has received
formal approval from the Cabinet of Ministers of the Government of
Uzbekistan to proceed with the AGF phase 2 underground sulphides
project ("Phase 2").

Wardell Annstrong International ("W AI") has been commissioned to
produce a bankable feasibility study based on a new increased tonnage
Phase 2 base case scenario developed by AGF. [...] Construction will be
subject to the normal permitting process.”

On 27 March 2008, i.e. over a year after the expiry of AGF’s Mining License and
Sanaot’s permission to AGF to continue operating under the expired license (see
above para. 500-503), by letter No. 14-337, Saonat invited AGF to submit further
documents with regard to AGF’s application to renew its Mining License (Exh. C-
317) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 355).

On 20 May 2008, the Kyzylkum regional department of Sanoat issued the
following “Expert Conclusion” (Exh. C-636):

“Tt was established that:

JV [AGF] adheres to all requirements of Uzbek legislation on subsoil
and on environmental protection, as well as rules and norms of safety,
workplace protection, sanitary norms and rules, hygiene norms, as well
as State standards;

Expert Conclusion
LJ

Experts consider possible to grant JV [AGF] the license on the right of
mining precious metals.”

On 22 May 2008, AGF submitted the additional documents requested by Sanoat
in connection with the renewal of AGF’s Mining License (see above para. 535)
(Exh. C-318).

On 3 June 2008, Mr. Tursunov from the MinFin responded to Oxus regarding
Oxus’ letter of 6 May 2008 In his letter., Mr. Tursunov emphasized the amounts
that Oxus still owed to the Ministry of Finance under the Special Dividend
Agreement and ordered Oxus to make one immediate payment and then monthly
payments starting from June 2008 until October 2009 (Exh. C-484).

In June 2008, WAI issued its ‘Bankable Feasibility Study of the Amantaytau
Goldfields’ Severny and Centralny Underground Sulphide Gold Deposits’
(hereinafter “WAI Phase 2 Bankable Feasibility Study”) (Exh. C-332), which was

to serve as ‘Final Feasibility Study’ in the sense of Decree No. 110 (see above
para. 532).

At some point in November 2008, WAI revised its WAI Phase 2 Bankable
Feasibility Study based on additional metallurgical test work, and increased the
reserve statement by an additional 271,000 ounces of gold (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 369, no exhibit submitted).

On 18 December 2008, Mr. Kholmatov, the Chief of State Inspection, wrote to
Mr. Shaismatov, the Deputy Prime Minister, asking him to give his approval to a
draft Protocol No. 3 according to which AGF’s request for a Mining License
would be approved. This draft Protocol No. 3 seemed to have been already
approved by twelve out of fourteen Ministers (Exh. C-507).

On 7 January 2009, AGF suspended operation of its gold processing plant. This
thus represented the end of AGF’s gold mining activities for Phase 1 of the
Project (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 360; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
249). In addition, it appears that the Heap Leaching operations at the
Vysokonovolntoe plant were halted because of intermediate product overstock in
AGF’s storages due to the inability to refine it through AMGK (indirect reference
in Exh. R-247).

On 16 January 2009, by Letter No. 40 to Goskomgeology, AGF applied for a
mining license for the Sarybatyr gold deposit (“Sarybatyr License”) (Exh. R-138)
(Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 267).

On 5 February 2009, AGF’s General Meeting of Shareholders unanimously
agreed to “temporary halt the Gold processing plant due to insufficient reserves
prepared for oxidise ores recessing that are suitable for refinement at the Plant”
and to “resume precious metals production at the "Vysokovoltnoe" plant as soon
as the JV AGF intermediate product stock reaches AGMK two-month supply”
(Exh. R-247). In addition, AGF management was entrusted “to prepare in terms,
stipulated by the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan documents for JV AGF
to obtain the license to use the subsoil of Sarybatyr deposit, as well as the
development, examination and approval of the feasibility study.”

Increasing Financial Challenges

On or around 30 April 2007, the MinFin issued the Minutes No. 23 ‘Of the
Meeting of the Republican Commission for Reduction of Late Debit and Credit
Liabilities and Strengthening of Discipline of Payments of the State Budget’
(hereinafter “Minutes No. 23”), in which it agreed to grant AGF and Claimant
deferment of certain tax payment obligations to the State and issued a revised

222

payment schedule regarding the payments due under the Special Dividend
Agreement to take into account the adverse circumstances that affected Oxus’
financial situation (Exhs. C-364/C-490/R-997 and R-379) (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 401). It reads as follows:

“I. The following shall be granted:

State financial support to JV [AGF] in the form of granting deferment on
paying the property tax, the withholding tax, customs payments (with the
exception of customs clearance fees) for imported goods and equipment for
its own needs accrued from I May 2007 for a period of 18 months provided
these deferred payments will be paid in equal instalments within 6 months
starting from 1 November 2008 in accordance with the payment schedule
per the Appendix;

Deferment of current payments to the Ministry of Finance of the Republic
of Uzbekistan for Oxus Gold plc, starting from 1 May 2007, stipulated by the
Agreement between the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan
and Oxus Gold ple dated 12 July 2004, for a period of one year provided the
deferred payments will be paid starting from I May 2008 in equal monthly
instalments within 12 months. This deferment shall be granted provided
Oxus Gold ple pays off its current liability as of 1 May 2007 within two
weeks.” (Exh. R-997, p. 2) (emphasis added)

551. On 26 April 2007, AGF held an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders
(Exh. R-403) to deal with the “urgency situation occurred in the production
activity of JV AGF and on possible ways out of it” and “approval of AGF Deputy
General Director appointment.” During this Meeting, Mr. Hill reported on the
situation and explained — among others — that “for the last two weeks the
enterprise was in extremely critical situation because of collection orders
amounting to around 4 bin. sums issued by tax authorities and Ministry of
Finance which almost paralyzed enterprise activity. The major part of their
working time AGF specialists spend for negotiations with tax authorities to obtain
permit to use some part of monetary resources from AGF current account for
payment of most important contracts and other pressing payments. Because of
non-payment Central Mining Administration plans to turn off power supply, the
production is limited because of the shortage of balls which JV was unable to pay

” On the other side, Mr. Mavlyanov of Goskomgeology raised the

following complaints regarding AGF’s way of operating:

in due time.

“Furthermore, Mr. Mavlyanov expressed his opinion about AGF work. He
informed that upon the results of enterprise visiting and documents studying
the following conclusions are made:

- permanently, starting from 2004 AGF fails to fulfill FS criteria and
assignments for precious metals production approved upon the
recommendation of JV AGF management;

223

- AGF permanently puts issues to the shareholders but does not propose
ways to solve them;

- organization of enterprise production is unsatisfactory, there are no people
responsible for production;

- operational discipline at the enterprise is unsatisfactory: Business plan is
not approved within the terms specified by the Charter systematically every
year, until now the Business plan for 2007 is not submitted to the
shareholders; contract with Joint-Stock Production — Association
"Uzmetkombinat" for delivery of grinding balls was being signed for a week,
until now AGF did not receive grinding balls from Ukraine and ore thermal
furnace regardless of AGF management assurance that all deliveries would
be performed by April 15 of current year. Mr. Hill was on vacation for two
weeks at the time when the enterprise is in hard condition and lot of issues
need to be solved.”

552. On 22 June 2007, AGF held its 2007 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (R-
180) addressing the following points:

“1. Information about expected performance figures and financial
statements for 1 quarter of 2007.

2. Consideration of approval of AGF Annual report for 2006 (the
result of its inspection by auditors and AGF Audit Commission).

3. Approval of Business plan for 2007.

4. Consideration and approval of changes the AGF Charter.

5. Election of new structure of AGF Supervision Board.

6. Establishment of JV AGF branch in Tashkent.

7. On cancellation of contracts for management services rendering
between Oxus Resources Corporation and JV AGF and between
[Goskomgeology] and JV AGF.”

With regard to item 7, in view of AGF’s financial difficulties, Goskomgeology
suggested suspending the validity of the 2007 AGF Management, AGF
Administration and AGF Services Agreements (see above paras. 421 and 422) and
their revalidation in case of “enterprise financial stabilization”. According to the
Minutes of the Meeting, Mr. Wilkins “informed that it is acceptable for Oxus to
defer payments under the contracts but not to cancel the contracts.” Upon
discussion, it was then agreed as follows:

“Upon discussion the General meeting has taken unanimously the
following DECISION:

224

553.

554.

555.

7.1. Within a week term the shareholders shall submit proposals about
the possibility to conclude additional agreement to the
abovementioned contracts for services provision stipulating deferment
of payments under them until the flow of AGF monetary resources
improves.

7.2. JV management together with Oxus should make changes into the
Contract for provision of general and administrative services as of
17.07.2002 and exclude the amount for compensation of expenses for
Tashkent office.”

On 30 June 2007, AGF reported a loss of USD 6,4 million (Exh. C-33).

26 September 2007, Mr. Hill sent an email to Mr. Wilkins, Mr. Kipps and Mr.
Polikashin (Exh. R-1054) discussing the use of an offshore bank account and
stating that the negative effects of “running the business in contravention of
legislation are greater’, than the negative effects of abiding by the Uzbzk laws.

On 19 October 2007, Oxus issued its Annual Report 2007, which provided as
follows with regard to the group’s financial situation and the AGF Project (Exh.
R-5_5):

“FINANCIAL RESULTS

The Group reports a reduction in gross revenue, excluding attributable joint
venture income, to $2.39 million (2006: $3.38 million), resulting primarily
from the loss of anticipated fee income following the sale of the Jerooy
project. The AGF joint venture contributed an attributable loss of $3.21
million for the year (2006: $10.17 million attributable profit). Total group
earnings for the year showed a loss after taxation and minority interest of
$18.91 million (6.25 cents per share loss) against a profit of $2.11 million
(0.73 cents per share profit) in the comparable year to 30 June 2006.

LJ

The Company has declared a dividend equivalent to $65.69 million (2006:
nil). The dividend was paid in specie by the distribution of the majority of the
KazakhGold Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) received as consideration
for the sale of the Jerooy project and certain other assets. The dividend was
equal to 17.98 cents per share.

LJ

UZBEK STATE TAX AUDIT

During July and August 2006 AGF underwent a State “complex” tax,
customs and compliance audit as part of the established regulatory
procedure. As a result of the audit, the State tax and customs authorities
initially claimed approximately $225 million in taxes, customs duties, fines
and penalties for alleged breaches of the Uzbek tax law. Subsequently the

225

Navoi Regional Economic Court and the Tashkent Supreme Economic Court
rejected $224 million of these claims. Oxus made provision within its annual
accounts to 30 June 2006 to cover its 50% share of the outstanding liability
of $1 million.

The State audit materially disrupted the ongoing operations of AGF due to
various restrictions imposed on assets and bank accounts whilst the tax and
customs claims were passing through the Uzbek legal process. There are
some residual issues still being negotiated with the Uzbek tax authorities
within the framework of ongoing constructive discussions which AGF
expects to resolve shortly.

During the period AGF also paid approximately $6.2 million in taxes that it
had previously been exempted from by virtue of tax privileges granted to
AGF by decrees of the Uzbek Government. Following constructive
discussions, for a period of 18 months with effect from 1 May 2007 AGF has
been granted a deferral of payment of withholding tax, property tax and
customs duties on imported goods. These deferred taxes and duties, of which
$1.03 million was accrued at the year end, will become payable in six
monthly instalments commencing 1 November 2008, and will be financed as
part of the capital cost of the Phase 2 sulphides underground project.”

556. On 7 March 2008, Mr. Abdukarimov, Vice-President of the Central Bank of
Uzbekistan, wrote to AGF referring to Mr. Rakhimov’s letter as follows (Exh. R-
82):

“Having considered your letter No337 dtd 4 March 2008 Central Bank has
to report the following.

According to clause 4 of Order No 477 dtd 22 September 1994 of the
Republic of Uzbekistan Cabinet of Ministers "About "Amantaytau
Goldfields" joint venture foundation and its efficient operation securement"
as well as "Order of issuing permissions to open accounts abroad"
registered by the Republic of Uzbekistan Ministry of Justice 22 January
1999 No610, the Republic of Uzbekistan Central Bank permits "Amantaytau
Goldfields" joint venture to credit revenues for export contracts to the
account opened in Barclays Bank, London (Great Britain).

However, we have to remind that it is necessary to maintain the established
order of obligatory sale of revenues in foreign currency via empowered
servicing bank in the Republic of Uzbekistan as well as to present timely
information about movements on foreign account.”

557. On 30 April 2008, Mr. Wilkins on behalf of Oxus wrote to Mr. Tursunov, the
Deputy Minister of Finance, with regard to the outstanding debt of Oxus (Exh. R-
1016). On one side, Mr. Wilkins acknowledged that Oxus owed an “amount
payable [of] 10.866.379 U.S. dollars, of which U.S. $ 4.935.150 should be paid
according to the Minutes No. 23 of the Meeting of the Republican Commission.”

226

558.

559.

oO

560.

On the other side, he made suggestions regarding the settlement of this amount as
follows:

“[...] we would like to offer the following option to settle the debts.

J. To sign a tripartite agreement of assignment of the debt between the
Ministry of Finance, “Oxus gold” and “AGF”. Under this agreement,
“Oxus” shall write off “AGF” the part of the debt in the amount of
4.935.150 dollars and delegate to the “AGF” obligation to pay this amount
to the Ministry of Finance as a special dividend.

2. The Ministry of Finance will support the “AGF” in the provision of the
return of the VAT from exporting of products on the same amount. “AGF”
having received these 4.935.150 dollars in the form of refund of VAT on the
same day shall transfer them to the Ministry of Finance for the payment of a
special dividend.

3. Regarding the rest of the amount of debt in the amount of 5.931.229
dollars, that must be paid till 31 October 2008, taking into account that the
“Oxus” currently attracts funding in the amount of $ 160 million dollars and
starting implementation of the Sulfide Project, we would like to ask You
about a delay in payment of this amount to start the export of products since
the second phase of the project start of production of metal under Sulfide
Project is planned for the second quarter of 2009.

As to our part, we guarantee the regular transfer of funds to repay that debt

within 20% of the revenues from the sale of each lot of precious metals
coming from the Almalyk MMC.”

On 6 May 2008, Mr. Wilkins of Oxus sent another letter to Mr. Tursunov, Deputy
Minister of Finance (Exhs. C-365/R-883), reiterating its proposals to settle the
debt as described in Mr. Wilkins earlier letter (see above para. 557). In this letter,
Mr. Wilkins again acknowledged the debt of USD 10,866,379 as arising out of the
Special Dividend Agreement, out of which USD 4,935,150 owed under the
Minutes No. 23 (see above para. 550). Compared to his earlier proposal, Mr.
Wilkins here announced that first gold production was expected during the third
quarter of 2009 (compared to the earlier mentioned second quarter) and proposed
that, as concerned Oxus’ undertakings, Oxus would “guarantee regular payments
of cash by AGF as repayment of this deferred loan of up to 10% of the revenue
from the sales of each shipment of precious metals received from [AMMC]”
(compared to the earlier proposal of 20%).

On 6 and 7 May 2008, RBS accepted a mandate from Claimant to act as exclusive
arranger of a debt facility of approx. USD 150 million, without however issuing a

formal commitment (Exhs. C-339/C-519) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 374).

On 3 June 2008, Mr. Tursunov from the MinFin responded to Oxus regarding
Oxus’ letter of 6 May 2008 (see above para. 558). In his letter, Mr. Tursunov

227

S61.

emphasized the amounts that Oxus still owed to the Ministry of Finance under the
Special Dividend Agreement and ordered Oxus to make one immediate payment
and then monthly payments starting from June 2008 until October 2009 (Exh. C-

On 24 September 2008, Oxus issued a Press Release (Exh. R-614_2) stating as
follows with regard to the financing of Phase 2 by RBS:

“[...] The Company has sufficient cash in the bank to meet its working
capital requirements and, since receiving Uzbek Government approval in
December 2007 to proceed with our flagship underground sulphides project
at AGF (the reason we invested in AGF in the first place), a Bankable
Feasibility Study (BFS) has been completed and the Royal Bank of Scotland
has been mandated as lead bank to arrange the necessary project finance for
AGF. With the current turmoil in the financial markets, the exact timing and
availability of this finance is difficult to predict. However, the necessary
steps to complete the financing continue to progress in a satisfactory
manner, as outlined in the section on new projects in the main body of this
report.”

562. On 2 November 2008, Mr. Kipps of Oxus sent an email to Mr. Tyler updating him

on the Phase 2 progress and stated as follows with regard to the financing by RBS
(Exh. R-1093):

“Our modelling expert, Anton Gazivov, has been beavering away bringing
the AGF 2009 Business Plan into the overall corporate model, which will be
available now in about three weeks time, as he told us on Thursday that he
has to go back to Russia as his mother in Astrahkhan is very ill. We have had
some debate with RBS who appear to want to project gold prices in later
years at unrealistically low values, but for evaluation purposes the price
pack included in their term sheet provides adequate revenues for the
sulphides project to meet its covenants, including the reserve tail ratio!

Largely, things are on track for the bringing the sulphides project to
drawdown - but RBS - as you are aware - appears unable to commit and it
doesn't look like they will go to credit until 2009; perhaps once the banks
have all got through the December 2008 quarter ends, they will be in a
better position to think positively into the future.”

563. In November 2008!%, Oxus Gold issued its Annual Report 2008 (Exh. R-10_6) in

which it stated as follows regarding the financing of Phase 2:

“Underground Sulphide Project

'S No specific date is available for the issuance of this Annual Report.

228

564.

565.

In June 2008 Wardell Armstrong International (WAI) completed a bankable
feasibility study (BFS) in respect of AGF’s underground sulphide Severny
deposit, and part of the Centralny deposit. WAI updated the study in
November 2008 to include additional reserve ounces. This study envisaged a
750,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) operation (increasing to 1.2 million tpa)
over an initial 8 year mine life, at a capital cost of approximately $170
million. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was mandated to arrange this
finance.

As a result of the current economic and financial conditions, this financing
has been delayed and the Company has been in discussions with other
potential sources of finance, including a major Chinese contracting and
financing group.

In May 2009, WAI completed an addendum to the BFS in respect of a lower
capital cost first phase of the underground sulphide project, which also
includes AGF’s sulphide tailings arising from transitional and sulphide ore
previously processed through the CIP plant as part of AGF’s open pit oxide
operation. This study envisages an initial 450,000 tpa operation at a capital
cost of approximately $73 million. The Company believes that, if the
originally envisaged project cannot be financed at this time, the lower
capital cost first phase of the project will be financed and that construction
will finally commence later in 2009, with first sulphide production now
scheduled for mid 2011.

The underground sulphide project is an extension and expansion of the
existing CIP operation and therefore benefits from the existing
infrastructure, existing skilled labour force and management’s experience of
operating in Uzbekistan.”

28 November 2008, Decree No. 4058 ‘On the Program of Measures to Support
Enterprises of the Real Economy, Ensuring their Stable Operation and Increase of
Export Capacity’ (hereinafter “Decree No. 4058”) was enacted (Exhs. R-756 and
R-1009). It aimed at “taking of concrete measures for support of export
enterprises by the Government in terms of providing for their competitiveness in
foreign markets and creating additional stimuli for exports” and, for this purpose,
“to grant soft working capital loans to export enterprises, temporary tax
exemptions to exporters and provide them with opportunities to restructure
existing credit debt.”

On or around 1 December 2008, Mr. Wilkins received RBS’s due diligence
report, which indicated that RBS would very likely not provide the anticipated
financing (reference in Exh. R-7, in particular Mr. Wilkins statement that
“(rJegarding RBS, we all agree that the dollars are unlikely to be forthcoming”)””.

© The RBS’s due diligence Report has not been filed; a reference thereto is made in Exh. C-65.

229

566. On 10-11 December 2008, Mr. Harry Eustace Sr. and Mr. Wilkins exchanged
various emails commenting on RBS’s refusal to finance the Project following the
issuance of a report by the James Mintz Group (“JMG”) (Exh. R-7). Mr. Wilkins
in particular stated as follows:

“Regarding RBS, we all agree that the dollars are unlikely to be

forthcoming. However the Cabinet of Ministers is expecting to approve the
project in QI 09 and to do that they require the completed Uzbek FS. I do
believe we should complete this so that we have a project properly approved
by CabMin, albeit stalled due to the financial situation. I also do not want to
do anything that would precipitate an RNS announcing that we have
cancelled or delayed the project without having something else positive to
say in its place. This would also be perceived very negatively in Uzbekistan.
So we quickly need to appraise the viability of any low capital cost
alternatives, and the acceptability of such alternatives to the Uzbeks, so that
we can inform the market at the same time we kill the big project.

And Mr. Eustace Sr. responded thereto as follows:

“Further to my earlier reply, this Mintz Report may be the ‘out’ that RBS
conveniently grabs to spare themselves any embarrassment and put it all on
us. That’s why we need to get on record as soon as possible objecting to it. I
had Carolyn Lamm look at it and she found it laughable. It was all rumor
and innuendo and no evidence and reads like a tabloid newspaper.”

567. On 19 December 2008, Mr. Wilkins from Oxus Gold wrote to RBS to object to
the findings of the JMG report (Exh. C-65) (see above paras. 565 fol.). He
concluded his letter as follows:

“Under the circumstances, Oxus objects to JMG’s Report as it stands now.
Oxus demands that RBS disregard the Report in its current state, and insists
that JMG plete a full, adeq and fair i igation. At a mini an
adequate investigation requires that JMG interview Oxus and Zeromax
personnel, review publicly-available and corporate documents, examine the
contemporaneous documentary evidence and sworn witness statements
concerning the purported allegations, and disregard secret sources who
provide uncorroborated information (unless JMG elects to identify the
sources). Simply put, the Report, as it stands now, lacks any credibility.

Finally, given the importance of the Report to this process, Oxus reserves all
rights and waives none.”

568. On 13 February 2009, Mr. Watts, General Director of AGF, and Mr. Narziev,
Chief Accountant of AGF, wrote to the Ministry of Justice informing the Ministry
that as per Decree No. 477 (see above para. 39) and Central Bank’s Letter No.
1308/2882 permitting opening of foreign accounts, it had opened an operating
account in Barclay’s Bank, London. Furthermore, AGF had entered into offtake
and loan agreements as per which the proceeds from the sale of metals must be

230

received in the account with the Barclay’s Bank. The said agreements were
registered as per Uzbek law. The Central Bank of Uzbekistan by letter No.
1316/395 had authorized crediting of foreign currency revenues to the Barclay’s
bank account. AGF also informed that it would provide monthly reports with
respect to the Barclay’s bank account as per Uzbek law (Exh. C-734).

On 27 February 2009, Mr. Mavlonov, First Deputy Chief of Department of the
Navoi Region of the Ministry of Justice replied to Mr. Watts, General Director of
AGF. He restated that, as per Decree No. 477 and Central Bank’s Letters Nos.
1308/2882 and 1316/395, AGF had been granted a right to open a bank account in
any currency in a bank in Uzbekistan or a foreign bank. It also stated that, as per
Uzbek law, legal entities which were residents of Uzbekistan were permitted to
open foreign accounts for the period of their functioning, in accordance with the
founding documents, agreements and contracts (Exh. C-735; Transcripts of 3 May
2014 (Day 6), 1513-1515).

Increasing Problems Regarding the Approval of the Feasibility Study
and the Obtaining of the Licenses

In_early February 2009, UzGeotechliti issued a document seemingly called
‘Feasibility Study for the Development of the Gold Sulphide Ores of
Amantaytau Severniy and Centralniy Deposits’ (hereinafter “UzGeotechliti
Phase 2 Feasibility Study”), which included comments on the WAI Phase 2
Bankable Feasibility Study (see above para. 544). It concluded that “it follows that
proposed project is cost-effective, efficient and offered for adoption and
implementation with [specific] major technical and economic parameters” (Exhs.
R-314 and C-688) (see above paras. 544 and 545).

 

Whilst Respondent contends that this document represents the ‘ORC Feasibility
Study’ and the ‘Final Feasibility Study” in the sense of Decree No. 110 (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 276), Claimant contests this qualification and
stresses that this was a document prepared by UzGeotechliti (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, paras. 943-944).

On_11 February 2009, Mr. Hill of AGF submitted to Mr. Mavlyanov of
Goskomgeology and to Mr. Kholmatov of the State Mining Inspectorate as well
as to Mr. Shemtov of NMMC, the UzGeotechliti Phase 2 Feasibility Study (Exh.
R-877; see above para. 570). It appears that Goskomgeology then forwarded this
study to the CabMin (Exh. R-232_7; see also Exh R-248).

On 2 March 2009, a meeting was held between Mr. Shoismatov, the Deputy
Prime Minister, and Goskomgeology. During this meeting, the Minister issued

certain recommendations regarding the further steps for the approval of the

231

UzGeotechliti Phase 2 Feasibility Study, with specific comments on the operation
costs and technical parameters as follows (Exh. R-232):

“Having considered submitted FS of the project "Mining of gold and sulfide
ores at North and South Amantaytau deposits," we report the following.

Total cost of the project is 261.2 mln doll., including cost of equipment -
107.1 min dollars, cost of construction and assembly operations - 96.5 min
doll. and others.

Financing of the project is carried out at the expense of credit funds of RBS
bank in the amount of 145.2 mln doll., Oxus Gold credit- 35.0 min doll. and
own funds of JV "AGF" CJSC - 42.8 min doll.

According to the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 07.06.2007 No.
110 Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investments and Trade
executes assessment of FS regarding possibility of the project
implementation on the basis of the proposed marketing concept, prospects of
finished products sale from the viewpoint of international market trends, as
well as utmost parameters of prices on equipment according to the proposed
technology.

Acceptability of construction and assembly operations cost must be
confirmed by the statement of the Gosarkhitektstroy.

Herewith, the results of the executed price expert assessment of equipment,
technical parameters of which are enough specified, confirm availability of
its cost optimization towards reduction (attachment without stamp is void).
At the same time, for full-scale assessment of the rest part of equipment it is
necessary to represent full technical parameters and to specify full name of
models.

Taking into account the above stated, statement in the part concerning
MFERIT may be issued as far as the above stated recommendations are
accepted.”

573. On 5 March 2009, M. Faizullaev, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economy,
sent a letter (prepared by Mrs. Malkina) to Goskomgeology commenting as
follows on the Uzgeotechliti Phase 2 Feasibility Study (Exh. R-315):

“[...] Recommendations

For successful implementation of the project, as well as for optimization of
economic parameters of the project initiator should:

Receive appropriate conclusions of MFERIT of the Republic of Uzbekistan
on value parameters of import processing equipment;

include measures to reduce the risk of failure to achieve the projected level
of development of production capacities;

optimize parameters of project cost (unforeseen costs and other costs);

232

after approval of the feasibility study in the prescribed manner, to bring
proposals on transfer of the project from consolidated list to the address
part of the investment program for 2009 to the Coordination Council on
implementation of large and strategically important investment projects
involving foreign investments.

Given the above stated, we consider it possible to implement the project
“Development of gold sulfide ore Northern and Central Amantaytau
deposits” in the prescribed manner with the recommendations and
remarks.”

On_18 March 2009, by Letter No. 16-451, Mr. Mavlyanov, Chairman of
Goskomgeology, wrote to Mr. Shaismatov, Deputy Prime Minister, informing
him of the comments from the various State authorities (and attaching the relevant
correspondence), including from the MinFERIT, the Ministry of Economy and the
Ministry of Finance, according to which the UzGeotechliti Phase 2 Feasibility
Study had to be revised and asking for an extension of time before submitting the
Final Feasibility Study to the CabMin (Exh. R-248).

On 24 March 2009, Mr. Mamadaliev of the CabMin directed Goskomgeology”” to
work with Claimant to finalize the Feasibility Study, taking into account the
remarks from the MinFERIT, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of
Finance (Exh. R-316).

On 30 April 2009, Goskomgeology submitted Claimant’s ‘Revised UzGeotechliti
Phase 2 Feasibility Study’ (hereinafter “Revised UzGeotechliti Phase 2
Feasibility Study”), reducing the total costs from USD 315,7 million to 305.1
million (Exh. R-318; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 978).

On 12 May 2009, by Letter No. 3-1/7-60 DSP, Mr. Faizullaev, Deputy Minister
of the Ministry of Economy, provided Goskomgeology”! with its comments
regarding some of the financial parameters of the Revised UzGeotechliti Phase 2
Feasibility Study (Exh. R-318). As concerns the financial parameters, the letter
noted that “the project is assumed to implement at the expense of credit funds
provided by RBS bank (Great Britain)”, while stressing the high interests of such
loan, and further concluded as follows:

“Project risks

J. Increase in terms of project implementation due to late start-up of the
facility.

2. Failure to follow development of production capacity and sales targets
declared in the feasibility study.

3. Lack of own funds for the project.”

Otherwise, the recommendations included in the letter were the same as those
included in Mr. Faizullaev’s earlier letter of 5 March 2009 (see above para. 573).

On 20 May 2009, Mr. Tulyaganov of the Ministry of Economy further wrote to
Goskomgeology — among others — as follows concerning the Final Feasibility
Study (Exh. R-234):

Le]

In the project FS provided the project total cost is increased [compared to
the Preliminary Feasibility Study approved on 5 December 2007] to USD
261.2 m. (exceeding maximum PFS cost in total USD 99.8 m.), including the
equipment — USD 95.4 m. and CAW— USD 96.5 m.

The project is planned to be financed on account of loan funds of RBS bank
in the amount of USD 145.2 m., Oxus Gold loan — USD 35.0 m, internal
funds of JV “AGF”, including monetary funds — USD 42.8 m., and also
current fixed assets — USD 38.1 m.

LJ

Due to the absence of necessary technical parameters of technological
equipment for processing unit, cost estimation was not conducted.

Whereas, the results of additionally conducted cost examination regarding
the equipment confirm that there exists a possibility to decrease its cost (the
appendix is invalid without seal).

Ina letter No.16 — 843 dated 20.05.2009 Goscomgeology informs that “The
contracts for the equipment supply, service execution, CAW cannot be
produced at the present moment since they are not concluded”, which
contradicts the requirements of the Decree mentioned above.

Taking into account everything stated above, the final statement regarding
MFERIT can be issued progressively as the recommendations mentioned
above are implemented and the project FS, complying with the requirements
of the Provision, validated by the Decree mentioned above, is produced.”

On 21 May 2009, WAI produced a further amendment to the WAI Phase 2
Bankable Feasibility Study (see above paras. 544 and 545), called ‘Stage I
Amendment to the June 2008 Sulphide Project Bankable Feasibility Study’, to
consider a lower initial capital start-up cost of the Phase 2, addressing the
difficulty in finding financing and lowering the risks associated with the Project’s
implementation (hereinafter “Phase 2 Final Feasibility Study”) (Exhs. C-334/R-
933_10).

On 11 June 2009, AGF held an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.
During this Meeting, Mr. Watts was asked to inform the shareholders of the

234

581.

582.

“Status of AGF JV and on anticipated production and financial parameters for 1
Quarter 2009.’ In this regard, the Minutes of the Meeting provide as follows
(Exh. C-302) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 340):

“[...] Mr. Watts informed the Meeting on the production parameters for
5 months 2009 saying that they won't really change for the first 6 months as
the operations have been suspended. For 5 months 2009 the following
quantities of metals were produced: gold — 163 kg, silver 4,167 kg; product
has been sold for the amount of US$6,386,000.

Mr Watts informed the Shareholders on the status of the mine. On 8 June
redundancy notices were issued to approximately 475 employees.
Management of AGF plans to resume production of anodes when the
Company is confident that the loan will be granted.

Mr. Mavlyanov noted that today sales of silver are the only source of income
for the Company and obtaining a loan should not be linked to production of
anodes. The requested loan is UZS21 billion and to produce 4 tonnes of
anodes will require US$21,000.

Mr R Wilkins informed the Meeting that all issues and problems of the
Company cannot be considered separately and should be resolved
simultaneously. They are production of anodes, receipt of a loan, VAT
returns and obtaining of the mining license for Sarybatyr deposit. [...]”

On 24 June 2009, Mr. Watts of AGF wrote to Mr. Mavlyanov, Chairman of
Goskomgeology, requesting assistance in connection with AGF’s application to
renew its Mining Licence, which was still pending with Sanoat (see above
paras. 415, 499, 503) (Exh. C-319).

On the same day, Mr. Hill of AGF, referring to Mr. Mamadaliev’s letter of 24
March 2009 (see above para. 575), wrote to Mr. Azimov, Deputy Prime Minister,
requesting the latter’s assistance with the approval of the Phase 2 Final Feasibility
Study and explaining the situation as follows (Exh. C-336):

Le]

At present we have positive conclusions from all Uzbek Authorities, except
for MFER&T as AGF have not presented Contracts for services, supplies,
construction for present moment.

There are several reasons for that:

lL As Clause 5 cites the Procedure of bids, approved in Uzbekistan, by
Cabinet of Ministers Decree of 03.07.2003 N°302. "Tender could be
only practical, when tender object is maintained by financing, being
approved by required documentation (Loan contract, Bank reference,
List of Construction activities, State Authority Decree et al."

235

583.

584.

585.

586.

2. Mandatory for finalizing of loan facility from foreign banks is an
approval of Feasibility Study.

This situation is "catch 22" and request introduced by MFER&T is

impossible.

In order not to disrupt implementation of the project the following is

proposed:

1. AGF will accept MFER&T recommendations in terms of costs
optimization for the total amount of $5.8M and adjust FS.

2. As equipment, selected in Feasibility is mostly imported,
contracting for manufacturing and supplies with detailization of
supplies conditions, assemblage could be effected after financing
availability, at a stage of development of Detailed Design, with

mandatory submission of all these contracts to MFER&T.

We kindly solicit for solution options.”

On 14 July 2009, by Letter No. NN-01/06-4763, MinFERIT informed
Goskomgeology that it could not recommend the Phase 2 Final Feasibility Study
for approval because, among other things, the proposed costs exceeded the costs
approved in the Preliminary Feasibility Study (USD 261,2 million compared to
USD 99,8 million), required parameters concerning necessary equipment was still
missing, and no funds had been arranged to finance the Project (Exh. R-235).

On 17 July 2009, AGF submitted to Goskomgeology the Feasibility Study of
industrial development of Sarybatyr gold fields (see reference in Exh. C-683).?

On _17 August 2009, Mr. Mvalyanov of Goskomgeology wrote to Sanoat”®
requesting the examination of AGF’s request for issuance of the Sarybatyr
License (see above para. 547) (Exh. C-683).

On 26 August 2009, Mr. Mamaladiev, Chief of the Information and Analytical
Department of the CabMin, wrote to Mr. Unsunov from AGF regarding the
latter’s request for the granting of the Mining License. He stated as follows (Exh.
C-508):

“With regard to your letter dated August 25 2009, No. 585, we report that
the documents for the extension of the license for the type activity carried
out by JV “Amantaytau Goldfields” — mining of precious metals is under

examination at the Cabinet of Ministers’ Commission on licensing of the
mining of precious and rare metals, precious stones.””*

On 21 December 2009, Mr. Hill from AGF sent a letter to Mr. Mavlyanov as
Chairman of Goskomgeology, concerning the Feasibility Study for Sarybatyr
(Exh. R-1135). In his letter, Mr. Hill stressed that preparing a complete Feasibility
Study was very cumbersome and that for this reason and “[alfter positive
conclusions of the due diligence authorities are obtained and the license is issued a
final feasibility study for use [of] the sub-soil area shall be prepared within the
established procedure.”

On 8 February 2010, Mr. Salamatin, General Director of AGF, sent a letter to
Goskomgeology requesting the renewal of the Renewed Exploration License,
which was due to expire on 7 August 2010 (Exh. C-324) (see above para. 529)
(Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 363; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 268).

The 2009 Tax Regime Changes

On 12 December 2008, an Uzbek newspaper issued a report about an upcoming
modification of the Tax Code. These modifications included a new Article 212
(Exh. C-342), according to which the “the zero rate VAT is introduced for the
turnover of cotton and lint and canceled for the turnover on precious metals for
export.” According to Claimant, it is through this news report that it heard for the
first time about the intended change in the VAT regime (Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 60).

On the same day, in view of the upcoming change of the VAT regime, Mr.
Wilkins wrote to the UK Ambassador, Mr. Hartley Booth, and Mr. Harry Eustace
Sr. wrote to the US Ambassador, Mr. Norland, for assistance and to make clear
that the envisaged VAT changes would jeopardize the financing of the AGF
Project (Exhs. C-343/C-344, see also Exh. C-691) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para.
380):

Le]

We urgently need clarification that this law, if introduced, will at least not
apply to AGF, as an existing foreign investor. The Foreign Investment Laws
should protect Oxus as a foreign investor from any adverse changes in tax
that materially and negatively impact the economics of the investment. This
will clearly apply in this case. Also I believe there is a ‘most favoured
nation’ clause in the UK-Uzbek Bilateral Investment Treaty. Since this law,
if introduced, will only affect AGF (both NUMC and AMMC do not export

but sell their precious metals to the Uzbek State), it could be argued that
AGF is being prejudiced against when compared to Uzkek entities.

Forcing AGF to sell its metal to the Uzbek State (presumably payable in
Uzbek Soums even if at the world price) will render international finance
impossible to obtain.

This is very serious and could mean that AGF is out of business early next
year. [...]”

On 15 December 2008, UK Ambassador Booth wrote to Mr. Elyor Ganiev, his
Uzbek counterpart at MinFERIT and the Co-Chairman of the Uzbek-British Trade
& Industry Council (hereinafter “UBTIC”), asking confirmation that the VAT
changes would not apply to AGF (Exh. C-345):

“It has come to the attention of Oxus that the proposed changes to the Uzbek
tax code, which still have to pass through final ratification before becoming
law with effect from I January 2009 onwards, contain a provision that
amends section 212 of the tax code such that the status of precious metals
exports will be changed from ‘zero rated’ to ‘standard rated’. If this
proposed change becomes effective, and if it applies lo AGF, it will mean
that AGF may have to pay over to the Uzbek State the equivalent of 20%
VAT on the value of all precious metals exports, despite the fact that in
practice AGF will not be able to receive this VAT from the purchaser of its
precious metals (currently Standard Bank in London). This would be
extremely damaging to AGF’s business and is also likely to jeopardise the
international financing currently being negotiated with the Royal Bank of
Scotland with regard to the proposed underground mine.

LJ
I would be very grateful if you could make the appropriate enquiries and,
hopefully, be able to give Oxus clarification on this matter and confirmation

that its investment in Uzbekistan will not be adversely affected by this
proposed change in the tax code. [...]”.

592. On 15 December 2008, Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Polikashin from Oxus met with Mr.

593.

Tursunov, Deputy Minister of Finance, to discuss the upcoming changes in the
VAT regime (indirect reference in Exh. C-540 and Transcripts of 2 May 2014,
1103:9-17 and 1104:6-14).

On 18 December 2008, Mr. Wilkins of Oxus wrote a letter to Mr. Tursunov,
Deputy Minister of Finance (Exh. C-540), following up on their meeting of 15
December 2008 and concluding as follows as concerns the VAT issues:

“Tam grateful to you for indicating that AGF will not be required to pay the
export VAT and that it will be offset in some way against the import VAT. It
is very important that we can understand the precise mechanism by which

238

594.

595.

this offset will work in practice, and that AGF will not be required to pay the
inevitable excess of export VAT over import VAT, since this excess, if
required to be paid, would itself represent a significant additional tax on
AGF. We note, and indeed you mentioned, that we are protected by the
Foreign Investment Laws against material and adverse changes in tax, but
nonetheless, given the possible imminent introduction of this change (from 1
January 2009) it would be extremely helpful to understand how it is
proposed to be implemented.”

Mr. Wiklins also asked for a meeting in January 2009 to discuss the various other
issues affecting AGF’s operations, including AGF’s cash flow problems, the USD
5 million VAT owed by AGF, the USD 15 million in metal value stockpiled at
AMGK and on site at AGF due to the alleged lack of capacity of AMGK to refine
silver doré bars, the USD 25 million owed by AGF to Oxus as shareholder loan,
the USD 10 million owed by Oxus under the Special Dividend Agreement. In this
regard, Mr. Wilkins reiterated his previous requests that some of these amounts be
offset with the VAT debt in order to unlock the situation (see above paras. 557
and 558).

On 22 December 2008, Mr. Narziev, AGF’s Chief accountant, sent a letter to Mr.
Watts as General Director of AGF, copying Mr. Yunusov and Mr. Sadikov both
directors of AGF. In his letter, Mr. Narziev warned Mr. Watts concerning various
financial liabilities and concluded his letter as follows (Exh. R-916):

“On 18 Dec 2008 the cash from the sale of precious metals was transferred
to bank account of company opened in Barclays bank.

I have come to you and reported all problems related to our liabilities and
debts. [...]

I and you together are responsible persons of joint venture, and each
operation conducted in Barclays Bank AGF account must be in
correspondence to the Law of Republic of Uzbekistan, no payments should
be done without our requisition for payment. In the middle of 2009 we are
waiting for a general inspection by state authorities. The tax committee first
of all will check all cash flows and movement of it in AGF account at
Barclays bank for last three years (2006-2008), for each of this operation we
will be responsible.

This is an official warning notification. Please warn authorized persons in
OXUS that all cash operations must be done according our requisition and
in correspondence of the Laws of Uzbek Republic. In case of next such
transformations I will have to apply to authorized bodies in order to protect
myself.”

On 1 January 2009, the new VAT regime applicable to the sales of precious
metals for export entered into force (Exhs. C-438/C-439). While sales of precious
metals for export were previously subject to a “zero rated” VAT treatment (i.e.,

239

596.

exemption from paying VAT on exports and reimbursement on VAT paid on
import of raw materials), the changes revoked this privileged treatment by
repealing favorable treatment of gold producers regarding the import of raw
materials (exemption of VAT on exports remained applicable, the reimbursement
of VAT paid on import of raw materials was revoked) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, paras. 286 fol.).

On 21 January 2009, Mr. Wilkins of Oxus wrote to Mr. Mirzayev, Deputy
Minister of Finance, asking for clarification and assistance as to how Claimant
and AGF should account for the impact of the new VAT regime as follows (Exh.
C-346):

“We understand that, with effect from I January 2009, the VAT status for
precious metals exporting companies has been changed from 'zero-rated' to
‘exempt’. AGF would appear to be the only company directly affected by this
change. We are extremely disappointed that we were neither consulted on
this matter, nor that anyone from the Government has yet attempted to
explain the impact of this change on AGF [...].

Oxus is currently in the process of arranging a $170 million project finance
facility from a consortium of international banks in order to fund the
development of an underground mine at AGF. This underground mine is
expected to increase AGF's gold production to 8-10 tonnes per year. I am
sure you will appreciate the difficulties we are facing in the current
economic climate. The banks and insurance companies (including MIGA, the
World Bank insurance company) are currently in possession of vast amounts
of data relating to the project, including a sophisticated economic model,
which is based on the Uzbek tax regime which existed in 2008. It would be
potentially disastrous to the financing process if we have to change this data
now.

At this time in particular, Governments around the world are taking special
steps to protect their local economies and businesses. We welcome the
recent decree which suggests that the Uzbek Government wishes to do the
same, especially regarding export orientated companies, and we confirm
that we wish to cooperate in the spirit of this decree as far as possible. We
therefore urgently need advice as to how AGF should account for the impact
of this change in VAT, and we assume that it is not intended to increase our
capital and operating costs by the imposition of a 20% irrecoverable VAT
charge on our imports and our local purchases. We also need to clarify the
position regarding the VAT which was recoverable by AGF as at 31
December 2008, and we assume that we will not be asked to write this
amount off. We further note that we have rights as a foreign investor under
the laws on Foreign Investment, and via the UK-Uzbek Bilateral Investment
Treaty.

I hope you will agree that AGF makes a significant contribution to the Uzbek
economy. We hope that this contribution will increase substantially over the
coming years. Please may I request that you arrange a meeting for me with
your appropriate specialists for the week beginning 2 February, when I shall
next be in Tashkent. I confirm that Oxus is ready to cooperate with the
Ministry of Finance in order to ensure that an appropriate resolution is
reached with regard to the above VAT issues in order that out business may
continue to the mutual benefit of all.”

On 29 April 2009, Mr. Wilkins of Oxus sent a letter to Mr. Turdimov, Khokim of
Navoi Region (Exh. C-306; see above para. 520), requesting the right to offset
AGF’s claim for reimbursement of VAT with money owed under the collection
orders and indicating that the State Tax Committee had already agreed to this
procedure.

On 29 May 2009, upon Oxus’ request and recommendation of the State Tax
Committee, Mr. Tursunov, Deputy Minister of the MinFin, sent a letter to AGF
agreeing to offset approx. USD 3,7 million of a total amount of USD 11,181,379
(USD 10,866,379 plus accrued interest). However, Mr. Tursunov’s offer was
conditioned upon the payment of the remaining USD 7,473,700 by 10 June 2009.
This payment was never made (Exh. C-373) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
310).

New Hopes Regarding Financing

On 3 September 2009, Claimant and the CITIC Consortium signed an initial term
sheet entitled Convertible Loan Notes Termsheets (hereinafter “Convertible Loan
Notes Termsheets”) (Exh. C-347) setting out the basic terms of the parties’
agreement to provide part of the financing through USD 60 million of convertible
loan notes, the proceeds of which were to be used for the general working capital
and working expenditures for the initial production of 450,000 tons per annum
AGF underground sulphide mine project (i.e., Phase 2). On the same day, CITIC
Consortium also agreed a Warrants Subscription Termsheet for the value of GBP
12.12 million (Exh. C-348) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 388).

On 30 September 2009, Mr. Wilkins of Oxus sent a letter to Mr. Azimov, First
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, in which he acknowledged the
“amount owing under the [Special Dividend] Agreement is $10,866,379,
excluding penalty interest” and making further suggestions to offset part of the
debt with outstanding VAT reimbursement owed to AGF and defer the remainder
of debt (Exh. C-367) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 404).

On_29 October _2009, AGF held an Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders (Exh. C-368), which dealt among others with the ‘Approval of

241

602.

603.

604.

payment of the special dividend in the amount of US$5 million to the Ministry
of Finance’ in accordance with the suggestions that Mr. Wiklins had made in his
letter to the Ministry of Finance of 30 September 2009 (see above para. 600).

On 2 November 2009, following an approval by the shareholders of AGF to make
a payment of USD 5 million under the Special Dividend Agreement, AGF made
the first instalment payment of USD 1 million to the MinFin (Exhs. C-368/C-
369).

At some point in November 2009, Mr. Li Peixing, Chairman of Baiyin Non
Ferrous Group Co. Ltd. as leader of the CITIC Consortium, wrote to the Board
Members of Oxus regarding the financing of the Project by CITIC as follows
(Exh. C-681):

“We regret that our regulatory approval process has taken longer than
originally expected. However, we can confirm that we are now in the final
stages of obtaining the relevant approvals and therefore expect the
transaction to be in a position to complete during December 2010, thereby
enabling the initial investment of approximately $85 million to be advanced
to Oxus.

We remain very supportive and positive of our relationship with Oxus and in
particular to assisting you to significantly increase gold production at the
Amantaytau Goldfields project in Uzbekistan, through expansion of the
existing open pit heap leach operations and construction of a new
underground mine. We also hope that you will continue to work closely with
the relevant Uzbekistan government authorities to resolve the major
regulatory issues including the mining licenses and approvals as well as in
securing their agreement for various protections that you have previously
presented to protect our substantial forthcoming investment, and we are
happy to help with this process where you consider appropriate. Please
maintain constructive communication with the relevant authorities so that
we can reach a mutually beneficial solution necessary to deploy the invested
funds in the further development of Amantaytau Goldfields.”

On 30 November 2009, Mr. Tian Wei, Vice Chairman of CITIC Construction Co.
Ltd, sent a letter to Mr. Leggard of Fairfax and Mr. Shead of Oxus Gold (Exh. C-
680) regarding the ‘Extension of the Irrevocable Undertaking and Other Related
Matters’. In this letter, Mr. Tian Wei identified a series of “Critical Issues “which
need to be resolved, or have mechanisms in place to mitigate such risks, if we are
to complete the Proposed Investment in a timely fashion.” Theses critical issues
included among others the following issues:

“1, Licenses — We noted there are numerous critical issues with the
various licenses that are required including:

a) AGR’s operating license expired on November 27, 2006;

242

605.

606.

b) The existing mining licenses may be subject to termination due to
failure of satisfaction of certain conditions including no positive
response from Geology Committee in relation to submitted feasibility
studies for two mining fields;

c) The existing mining licenses are going to expire on 7 August 2012;

d) The sulphide project’s feasibility study needs to be approved. In
addition, a new underground mining license as well as a license to
construct and operate underground mining shafts needs to be issued;
and

e) AGF’s land use rights are not complete.

2. Taxes — In addition to the resolution of the outstanding tax disputes with
the tax authority, we need to seek assurance and preferential treatments or
exemptions of certain taxes such as property tax, VAT, import duties,
withholding tax, excess profit tax in order to operate AGF profitably.

3. Currency — We need to seek exemption or reduction for mandatory
foreign currency conversion.

4. Refining capacity — We need to obtain assurances on refining capacity
within Uzbekistan or permission to export for refining.

5. Infrastructure — We need assurances on the supply of electrical power
and [technical] water at AGF.”

On 6 January 2010, Oxus and the CITIC Consortium signed a GBP 34,380,000
‘Equity Subscription Agreement’ (Exh. C-351). Under this Agreement, the
CITIC Consortium would invest in Oxus by the subscription of new ordinary
shares, subject to various warranties and the fulfilment of various conditions, with
a longstop date of 31 December 2010 for the finalization of the funding agreement
(Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 391). This Agreement was subject to various
conditions (Article 2), among which were (i) CITIC’s ability to obtain all
necessary Chinese State authority approvals, (ii) AGF’s right “of ownership,
lease, temporary or permanent use (as the case may be) for all of the existing land
plots used by AGF in the Tomdi and Kontimeh Distribts of the Navoi Region”, and
(iii) the execution of a Foreign Investment Agreement (“FIA”) between Oxus, the
CITIC Consortium, AGF, and the Uzbek Government by 30 June 2010 (Claim.
SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 392).

On 27 January 2010, Mr. Wilkins of AGF wrote to Mr. Azimov, First Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, announcing that “the transaction, by
which the CITIC Group will provide up to $185 million in financing to Oxus, was
formally approved.” Mr. Wilkins made suggestions on how to use these loans
with regard to AGF and the amounts owed under the Special Dividend Agreement
and requested a meeting with Mr. Azimov to discuss this (Exh. C-352) (Claim.
SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 393).

On 4 and 23 March 2010, Mr. Wilkins wrote to Mr. Azimov, First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance, and to Mr. Ganiev, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of MinFER, referring to his earlier letter of 27 January 2010 (see above
para. 606) and requesting again a meeting with Mr. Azimov to discuss how to use
the CITIC financing with regard to AGF and the amounts owed under the Special
Dividend Agreement (Exhs. C-353 and C-355, C-461) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 394; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 296).

On 30 March 2010, by ‘Instruction No. 06/104-57’, Deputy Prime Minister
Azimov forwarded Claimant’s proposal to the Ministries of Finance, Economy
and Justice, and to NMMC and Goskomgeology, with instructions to review the
proposal and to revert with a conclusion, in accordance with the established
procedure (Exh. R-319) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 297).

In_ April 2010, various Ministries, including the Ministry of Justice and the
Ministry of Economy, as well as Goskomgeology rejected Mr. Wilkins’ proposal
regarding the terms of the loan between ORC and AGF (see above paras. 606 and
607). They took issue, among others, with (i) the proposed interest rate of LIBOR,
(ii) the fact that it was not possible to assess the second and larger tranche of the
loan, because of missing information on commercial terms, (iii) Claimant’s
proposal to capitalize debt as a contribution to AGF’s Charter Fund, because
Decree No. 266 and AGF’s Charter required Claimant to make any additional
contribution to the Charter Fund in cash, and (iv) Claimant’s proposal for various
tax privileges (Exhs. R-320, R-321, R-405).

In or around April 2010, Oxus purchased an Atlas Copco drill rig for the amount
of USD 2,562,599, which was made available for use by AGF for purposes of
improved exploration (see Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1339 and
references to this purchase in Exhs. C-692-C-694).

On 14 May 2010, Mr. Willkins sent a ‘Draft Foreign Investment Agreement’
(“FIA”) (which was required under the Equity Subscription Agreement, see above
para. 605) to the CabMin. Mr. Wilkins forwarded it further to the Minister of
Economy, the Minister of Justice and the MinFin, as well as to the Chair of the
State Tax Committee, the Acting Chair of Goskomgeology (Mr. Turamuratov)
and the Director General of NMMC (Mr. Sanakulov) requesting comments
thereon (Exhs. C-356-C-360; R-662, R-386/R-387) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 396). According to Respondent, this draft FIA did not take into account the
comments made by the various Ministries and Goskomgeology on the loan terms
proposed by Claimant (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 300).

244

612.

615.

On 29 May and 1 June 2010, the State Tax Committee and the Ministry of Justice
provided various suggestions and comments” on the draft FIA (Exhs. C-361/C-
362).

On 8 June 2010, the CITIC Consortium and Oxus entered into a ‘Deed of
variation and waiver between Oxus Gold ple and CITIC Consortium’, under
which the CITIC Consortium dropped the requirement of the FIA (Exh. C-363)
(Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 398).

On 9 June 2010, Oxus announced the amendment of the financing agreement with
CITIC so that its completion was “conditional only upon receipt of the regulatory
approvals from the Chinese Government and admission of the new ordinary
shares to trading on AIM by 31 December 2010.” (see references in Exh. C-396,).

At some point in August 2010, upon request of CITIC, the Northwest Institute for
Mining and Metallurgy issued at ‘Study Report for Feasibility of Project for
Developing the Severny and Centralny Sulphide Ores’ (Exh. C-486). It evaluted
the Project as follows:

“1.2.14 Combined evaluation conclusions of project

Centralny and Severny underground sulphide ore development is a
key of AGF company’s future survival and development. This area is
high in ore grade, relatively centralized in resource, dense in
exploration engineering, high in ore body control level, and also the
core of benefits produced by AGF company. The construction of
project investment has better effects. The construction of
underground sulphide ore project can not only create good
economic benefits for the company but also drive the rapid
development of local economy, increae local taxation, solve the
employment problems of local residents, and create good economic
and social benefits. In a word, the execution of this project can not
only get better economic beneifits but also excellent social benefits.
The project is feasible in technology and reasonable in economy, so
it’s quickly recommended to perform this project”.

At the same time, the Report also pointed out the following problems :

“1.4 Existing problems and advices

The development and construction of this project are facing some
problems, mainly including:

J. Political and policy risks for overseas investment.

*5 These suggestions and comments appear at first sight rather minor, but the deficient quality
of the translation does not entitle a full appreciation thereof.

2. Current technical and economic analysis is fully based on reality
and reliability of geological data submitted by the former Soviet
Union and OXUS company, who haven't carried out any
engineering certification to this area. Meanwhile, it must be pointed
out that a lot of prospecting works in the pits for Centralny and
Severny underground construction during the period of former
Soviet Union are required to apply the secondary delineation of ore
bodies controlled by this partial project during the next initial design
to ensure the reliability of reserves.

3. Complex technical conditions of ore body mining, mainly
including the following aspects: poor rock stability, complex
orebody shape, most branched small ore bodies.

4. The communication difficulties caused by languages or cultural
environment must be overcome.

On 6 September 2010, Mr. Shead of Oxus sent a letter to Mrs Guskova of the
MinFin, referring to the latter’s letter of 28 August 2010, and explaining why
AGF had not been in a position to pay the amounts according to the Special
Dividend Agreement. He made reference to Oxus’ earlier correspondence (see
above paras. 597, 598, 600) suggesting new payment plans, and making renewed
suggestions concerning the payment, by partial set-off, of the owed amount (Exh.
R-888).

On 20 September 2010, upon request from the MinFin, Mr. Wilkins wrote to Mr.
Gulyamov of the MinFin attaching a signed ‘Payment Reconciliation Deed’ of
the amount due under the Special Dividend Agreement, by which Oxus
acknowledged its liability of USD 10,841,256.16 to Respondent (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 408) (Exhs. R-888, 889 and C-464).

1.5 2010-2012 : The Escalation Leading to Oxus Departure from Uzbekistan
and Declaration of Force Majeure

The Uzbek Court Proceedings Regarding the Special Dividend
Agreement

On 23 September 2010, the MinFin launched a lawsuit against Oxus (with AGF
participating as third party) before the Economic Court of Tashkent requesting
payment of USD 10,8 million under the Special Dividend Agreement (Exh. C-
378) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 409; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
314).

246

619.

620.

621.

622.

623.

On 27 September 2010, the Tashkent Economic Court set a court hearing date of
18 October 2010 (Exh. C-379). Claimant contends that it only received the
MinFin’s Statement of Claim itself in London on 6 October 2010 (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 410).

On 12 October 2010, AGF’s counsel submitted a petition to the Tashkent
Economic Court requesting the postponement of the court hearing by ten days
(Exh. C-382). According to Claimant, the court judge explained to AGF’s counsel
that such request would have to be filed on 18 October 2010 (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 412).

On 18 October 2010, the hearing before the Tashkent Economic Court took place,
during which AGF’s counsel requested the postponement of the hearing.
According to Claimant, although the MinFin did not object, the Court rejected the
postponement, which left counsel for AGF and Oxus with no other choice than to
plead on the spot only arguments they were able to present then and there (Claim.
SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 415).

On the same day, the Tashkent Economic Court rendered its Judgment ruling as
follows (Exh. C-386):

“[...] the court
HAS RULED OUT AS FOLLOWS:

J. The application of the defendant and the third party for
adjourning the hearing on the case for another day shall be
rejected.

N

The claim of the Ministry of the Finance of the Republic of
Uzbekistan shall be satisfied.

w

. Oxus Gold ple shall be surcharged in favour of the Ministry of
Finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan US$10.841,256-16.

w

. Oxus Gold ple shall be surcharged the state fee in the amount of
US$108,412 and UZS 5,000 of mail expenditures.

vw

The writ of execution shall be issued after this resolution becomes
enforced.”

On 11 November 2010, Mr. Wilkins of Oxus wrote a letter to Mr. Azimov of the
MinFin. Mr. Wilkins acknowledged Oxus’ determination in paying the amount

owed under the Special Dividend Agreement as follows (Exh. C-395):

“T[...] wish to reassure you that Oxus has every intention of paying
the Special Dividend in the amount of $10.8 million which is owed to

247

624.

625.

626.

627.

628.

the Ministry of Finance as a result of the 2004 agreement relating to
hedged gold sales. Oxus is in the process of completing a major
financing with a consortium of Chinese investors. I attach a letter
from the consortium confirming that funds are expected to be made
available to Oxus next month. These funds will enable us to pay our
liability to the Ministry of Finance and to make significant further
investments into Uzbekistan for the purposes of developing the
business of AGF.

[...] We [...] have presented our proposal to the AGF shareholders
for consideration and discussion. I also attach a copy of these
proposals for your information, which include an offer to capitalise
$25 million of Oxus’ shareholder loans into the AGF Charter Fund,
and the creation of a Zrafshan Community Development Fund, to be
funded by Oxus, using its shares on the London Stock Exchange. [...]”

This letter was forwarded by Mr. Azimov on 13 November 2011 to Ministry of
Finance (Exh. R-1409):

On 2 December 2010, Oxus appealed against the judgment of the Tashkent
Economic Court of 18 October 2010 (Exhs. C-388/C-416) (see above para. 622).

On 19 July 2011, Uzbekistan started an action before the UK High Court for
enforcement of the judgment of the Tashkent Economic Court against Oxus in
relation to the Special Dividend Agreement.

On_10 September 2012, the Parties agreed to stay the litigation concerning
payment under the Special Dividend Agreement during the pendency of this
arbitration (Exh. C-503).

The Failure to Obtain Financing

On 17 November 2010, Oxus published a regulatory statement, confirming that it
had been informed that “the most critical of the approvals necessary to give effect
to the financing [by CITIC] has been granted by the relevant Chinese authority
[the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (hereinafter
“NDRC”)], while the other two largely administrative approvals are also being
processed without any known issues” and stating that “[t]he Directors of Oxus
remain confident that the financing will be completed during December 2010”
(Exh. C-396) (Wilkins II para. 122).

On 30 December 2010, i.e. one day before expiry of the deadline provided under

the Equity Subscription Agreement between Oxus and CITIC Consortium for
finalization of the funding agreement (see above paras. 605 and 613), the CITIC

248

1.5.3

629.

630.

631.

632.

Consortium informed Oxus by email that the Chinese Embassy in Tashkent had
been unable to give financial clearance to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, and
thus the final regulatory approvals could not be signed off. Rather than extend the
deadline, the CITIC Consortium allowed the arrangement to lapse on 31
December 2010 (Exh. C-398). According to Claimant, this made it impossible for
AGF to move forward with the development of Phase 2 (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 433).

Challenges Regarding the Renewal of the Cyanide and Renewed
Exploration License

On 19 August 2010, by Letter No. 11-1310, referring to AGF’s application for
extension of its Renewed Exploration License (see above para. 588),
Goskomgeology informed the CabMin that AGF had failed to conduct its
previous exploration works. In particular, only 4.5% of the exploration plan had
been carried out in 2009 and the terms and conditions of the subsoil use had not
been observed. Nonetheless, Goskomgeology explained the need for an extension
of the Renewed Exploration License in order to “complete the projected
geological exploration at the projects of 2010 [...] of Sarybatyr and Nukrakon
fields and exploration of deep layers at Severny Amantaytau field” and to conduct
“follow-up exploration of gold ore areas of Severny Asaukak, Aksay, Seredinny,
Takazgan, Severny Daugyzau and Yasaul blocks” in 2011 (Exh. R-874) (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 269).

On 22 September_2010, Mr. Salamatin of AGF sent a letter to the CabMin
explaining that the Cynanide License (see above para. 472) was expiring on 23
September 2010 and that, because of negligence on behalf of AGF, all the renewal
documents had not been prepared on time. Mr. Salamatin thus raised the
following request: “Given the strategic importance of our products and to avoid
disruption of public works contracts in 2010 we urge you to keep for the license
renewal period our right to transportation, storage and use of high-toxic
substances.” (Exh. R-846).

On the same day, Mr. Salamatin of AGF also sent a letter to Goskomgeology
reiterating AGF’s request for prolongation of the Renewed Exploration License
(see above para. 588; see reference in Exh. R-1138).

On_23 September 2010, Mr. Yunusov from Goskomgeology replied to Mr.
Salamatin informing him that the extension of the Renewed Exploration License
was still under review and that in the meantime Sanoat permitted to AGF the “use,
transportation and storage of toxic agents at [its own] risk and subject to
compliance with license requirements.” (Exh. R-1138).

On the same day, AGF’s Cyanide License expired (see above para. 472) (Claim.
SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 365).

On _ 24 September 2010, by Letter No. 974, AGF submitted an amended
Preliminary Feasibility Study (Exh. R-140) in support of its application filed on
16 January 2009 to obtain the Sarybatyr License (see above para. 548).

In the following days, AGF submitted an application to Sanoat and the CabMin
for renewal of its Cyanide License (Exh. C-330, only indirect evidence) (Claim.
SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 366).

On 5 October 2010, by Letter No. 29-02/15559, Sanoat informed AGF that the
Cyanide License had expired on 23 September 2010 and that a “license
prolongation application was not made in time.” Sanoat ordered AGF to proceed
as follows (Exh. R-215):

“The management of JV "AGF" CJSC is to take urgent measures on license
prolongation and find out the defaulters for drawing them to disciplinary
liability. Copy of the order on punishment is to be submitted to [Sanoat] by
10.11.2010.”

On 2 February 2011, notwithstanding that AGF’s Cyanide License had expired,
Sanoat allowed AGF to use, transport, and store poisonous substances for a
limited time period until 20 February 2011 (Exh. R-217) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 270).

On 7 April 2011 and 6 June 2011, notwithstanding that AGF’s Cyanide License
had expired, Sanoat extended AGF’s ad hoc permission to use, transport, and
store poisonous substances for a limited time period until 1 June 2011 and 1
September 2011 respectively (Exh. R-219 & R-222) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 270).

On 2 February 2012, notwithstanding that AGF’s Cyanide License had expired,
Sanoat, upon AGF’s request (Exh. R-223), extended again AGF’s ad hoc
permission to use, transport, and store poisonous substances for a limited time
period until 1 June 2012 (Exh. R-222) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 270).

The 2011 Tax Changes

On 30 November and 3 December 2010, the Uzbek Parliament and the Senate
adopted Law No. ZRU-274 ‘On Introduction of Amendments and Additions to
Several Legislative Acts of the Republic of Uzbekistan in Connection with
Adopting the Main Vectors of Tax and Budget Policy for 2011’ providing for

250

645.

further changes in the VAT regime and which was to come into effect on 1
January 2011 (Exh. C-715).

On 1 January 2011, the VAT regime under the Tax Code was modified, whereby
the exemption from payment of VAT on precious metal sales granted by the Tax
Code was abolished (Exh. C-1140). The effect of this further change to the tax
regime was that AGF’s precious metals export sales would be “standard rated” for
VAT purposes at 20%.

AGF’s Uzbek Shareholders’ Request for Liquidation of AGF

On_16 September 2010, Mr. Sanakulov of NMMC and Mr. Turamuratov of
Goskomgeology each wrote a letter to the members of the Supervisory Board of
AGF requesting to convene an extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of
AGF and asking to include in the agenda the issue of voluntary liquidation of JV
Amantaytau Goldfields AO (Exhs. C-390 and R-251).

On 19 October 2010, Mr. Turamuratov, Chairman of Goskomgeology, wrote to
the Supervisory Board of AGF complaining about not having received its
dividends for a long time, proposing to hold a Meeting of the Supervisory Board
and to convene an extraordinary General Meeting of AGF, including the issue of
voluntary liquidation of AGF in the agenda of this Meeting (Exh. C-391) Claim.
SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 421).

On 21 October 2010, Mr. Wilkins of AGF met with Mr. Turamuratov of
Goskomgeology and then wrote to the latter and Mr. Sanakulov of NMMC,
challenging the position of Goskomgeology and NMMC as unreasonable and
explaining that in view of the USD 185 million financing that Claimant was
seeking to secure, it made no sense to liquidate AGF, and that in any event, as a
listed company, Oxus could not take any such decision without first calling its
own Extraordinary General Meeting (Exh. C-392) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para.
423).

On 10 December 2010, Mr. Shead of Oxus sent a letter to Mr. Turamuratov of
Goskomgeology and Mr. Sanakluov of NMMC addressing their request for
voluntary liquidation of AGF as follows (Exhs. C-18, see also C-397) (Claim.
SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 428):

“[...] In the letters dated 19 October and 16 September, you indicated
that the reason for requesting the voluntary liquidation of AGF was
due to the failure of AGF to pay dividends. We note that the dividend
to NMMC has since been paid.

251

The feasibility study for the Phase 1 open pit project envisaged that
AGF would pay dividends totalling $37.4 million to each of the Uzbek
parties and Oxus. In fact only $4.6 million has been declared to each
party to date, of which $0.9 million is still outstanding to
Goskomgeology, and $3.3 million to Oxus. However, the feasibility
study also envisaged that AGF would pay taxes in a total amount of
$13.9 million. In fact AGF has paid $53.1 million to date. If taxes and
dividends are therefore taken together, the Uzbek State is $5.5 million
better off, whilst Oxus is $36.1 million worse off. Since 2006, when
AGF's tax privileges were removed, AGF has paid 24.7% of its gross
cash flow to the Uzbek State in taxes. It is therefore clear that Oxus'
investment has been materially affected by the changes in tax and VAT
regimes imposed on AGF since Oxus made its original investment. As
a result of this Oxus is still owed approximately $31.6 million by AGF.
Furthermore, the change in VAT regime was unilaterally imposed on
J January 2009 without any prior consultation with Oxus. At the time
Oxus was in the process of arranging a $150 million project financing
from the Royal Bank of Scotland in order for AGF to develop the
Phase 2 underground project. This VAT change, which increases
certain of AGF's capital and operating costs by 20%, contributed to
the failure of RBS to ultimately provide the finance to AGF, and has
forced Oxus to seek the funds elsewhere, which inevitably has resulted
in a delay in financing Phase 2.

Nevertheless, Oxus remains of the view that AGF should not be
liquidated. AGF has produced 17 tonnes of gold and 86 tonnes of
silver to date (against a forecast of 20 tonnes of gold and zero tonnes
of silver). AGF is ahead of target for 2010 and is operating profitably.
AGF can continue to operate profitably provided the appropriate
licenses are issued and AGF's tax regime can be stabilised. AGF (with
the mining contractor) employs some 225 people, and this number will
increase substantially when the underground mine is built. Oxus is in
the process of completing a financing package of $185 million with a
consortium of Chinese Investors. This amount is primarily intended to
be made available by Oxus to AGF, provided Oxus can obtain an
appropriate return on investment. Oxus expects to complete the
financing within the next 4-5 weeks [...]”.

Mr. Shead then concluded his letter by offering to buy Goskomgeology and
NMMC’s combined 50% shareholding in AGF, or else to sell Oxus own 50%
shareholding to the Uzbek shareholders:

“Oxus hereby offers to buy or sell 50% of AGF for an amount equal
to:

252

- 50% of the value of AGPs existing balance sheet, at book value
accounted for in accordance with Uzbek GAAP, adjusted as
appropriate to reflect specific amounts due to particular
shareholders, payable in cash no later than 31 March 2011; plus

- A ‘production royalty’ of $50 per ounce of gold and $2 per ounce
of silver for each future ounce produced from deposits within
AGF’s existing 192 square kilometre 'Project Territory’, payable
in cash within 30 days of the end of the calendar quarter of
production.”

646. On 15 December 2010, an ‘Extraordinary Meeting of the Supervisory Board’ of
AGF was held, attended in particular by Mr. Turamuratov of Goskomgeology
(chairing the Meeting), Mr. Tursunov of NMMC, Messrs. Wiklins, Polikashin and
Hill of AFG/Oxus. As concerns Mr. Shead’s proposal of 10 December 2010, Mr.
Turamuratov announced that the Uzbek Parties were interested only in the option
of purchasing Oxus’ share in AGF, whereby they disagreed with the royalties to
be paid to Oxus finding those to be excessive. Mr. Turamuratov further mentioned
that the purchase of Uzbek share in AGF was not a possibility. Mr. Wilkins
strongly objected to this stating that it was a “nationalization of AGF” and added
that new investors in Oxus were ready to invest cash in expansion of AGF.

The Minutes of the Meeting then provide that “Members of the Supervisory Board
unanimously AGREED that specific proposals and arguments of each party
regarding future activities of AGF will be considered at the General Meeting of
Shareholders of AGF.” (Exh. C-300). Mr. Turamuratov then proposed to convene
an extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on 26 January 2011 to deal
with (i) changes to the members of the Supervisory Board, and (ii) voluntary
liquidation of AGF. Mr. Wilkins noted that inclusion of these issues in the agenda
of the General Meeting of Shareholders of AGF would lead to a requirement of a
public statement from Oxus and therefore suggested to re-word the second item in
order not to expressly mention “liquidation”, but rather “re-structuring”.

The Supervisory Board however made the following decision:

“Members of the Supervisory Board AGREED as follows:

1.1. An extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of AGF shall
be convened on 26 January 2011 at 3 pm at the premises of
Goskomgeology;

1.2. Due to majority of votes of the members of the Supervisory Board
the following issues shall be included in the agenda of the
extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of AGF:

3. On changes to the members of the Supervisory Board.

4, On voluntary liquidation of AGF.”

On 26 January 2011, the scheduled Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting
of AGF was re-secheduled for 24 February 2011 (Exh. R-408). In the letter
rescheduling the Meeting, Mr. Turamuratov specified that “[i]n relation to
conduction of the extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of CJSC
"Amantaytau Goldfields", we ask you to send an authorized representative(-s) on
behalf of "OXUS RESOURCES CORPORATION".”

On 21 February 2011, Mr. Shead on behalf of Oxus sent a letter to Mr.
Turamuratov of Goskomgeology asking to re-schedule the General Meeting
planned on 24 February 2011 to 3 March 2011 ”[d]ue to the unavailability of the
authorised representative of Oxus Resources Corporation” (Exh. R-409), a
request granted by Mr. Turamuratov on 28 February 2011 (Exh. R-410).

On_3 March 2011, the scheduled AGF Extraordinary General Shareholders
Meeting should have taken place, but was rescheduled to 23 March 2011 due to
the fact that Oxus’s representatives failed to attend (Exh. R-411; Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 321).

On the same day, Oxus’ legal counsel wrote a letter to President Karimov, to First
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Azimov, to Acting Chairman of
Goskomgeology, Mr. Turamuratov, and to General Director of NMMC, Mr.
Sanakulov, explaining the difficult position Oxus had been put in by Respondent’s
actions and making clear that any further attempt to liquidate AGF contrary to the
interests of its shareholders would oblige Claimant to commence legal
proceedings in order to protect its interests (Exh. C-12) (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 442).

The 2011 Audit and the Thereto Related Escalation of the Situation

On 1 February 2011, by Letter No. CB/13-03-32-18/6, the MinFin requested
permission from the Republican Council for Coordination to conduct an
unscheduled inspection of AGF in February and March 2011 (Exh. R-666).

On 16 February 2011, the Republican Council for Coordination issued ‘Order No.
15’ authorizing representatives of the MinFin, as well as specialists from the State
Tax Committee, Goskomgeology, and Sanoat, to perform an unscheduled
inspection of AGF as follows (Exhs. R-663/C-402):

“To control the observance of requirements of legislative documents
and pursuant to the article 12 of the Law of Republic of Uzbekistan
“State control of business entities’ activities” the Ministry of Finance

254

653.

654.

is permitted when required to engage employees of State Tax
Committee, State Geological Committee and state inspection
“Sanoatgeocontechnazorat” in February-March 2011 with the
condition not to exceed duration of inspections more than 30 days to
perform unscheduled inspection on the basis of the program for
additional inspection at the joint venture “Amantaytau Goldfields”
(N°. 202196034).” (Exh. R-663)

On the same day, Prime Minister, Mr. Mirziyoev, issued an order to proceed with
the Audit from 21 February to 22 March 2011 (hereinafter the “Audit 2011”), for
a period of no more than 30 days (Exh. C-403). The purpose of the inspection was
stated to be “to control observance of current legislative acts requirements and in
order to audit financial statements and verify observance of tax legislation
requirements.”

On 23 and 26 February 2011, Mr. Hill of ORC wrote to the Board of Directors of
Oxus and to Mr. Shead complaining about the Audit and its potential
consequences. In its email of 26 February 2011 to Mr. Shead (Exh. C-493), Mr.
Hill reported the opinion of an unspecified ORC staff as follows:

“The stated purpose of the current audit of the financial and economic
activities of AGF is twofold: audit of the rational (or reasonable) use
of sub-soil and audit of the rational (or reasonable) use of cash,
especially hard currency. Usually an audit like this is carried out
when a company is being liquidated (typically after the liquidation or
before, if they need to make sure that billions of soums are not
missing, but usually after the liquidation is announced, which means
that in this case, in their minds, the liquidation is imminent). The
reason is to get a full picture of AGF’s operations and Oxus’s
involvement in managing AGF. There is definitely no evaluation of the
assets taking place.

The real purpose is to get as much evidence of violations of Uzbek
laws, criminal and/or just negligent mismanagement which will allow
the state to carry out forceful liquidation of the company in case the
foreign shareholders will not agree to volutary liquidation. Based on
the result of the report the prosecutor’s office will pitch up at the
minesite, seize the assets and start numerous criminal cases against
former and current management of AGF whose signatures are under
documents against which cash was transferred abroad. Their main
accusation is conspiracy in pumping hard currency out of the country
and that’s why they are scrutinizing every service contract including
contracts with BCM and MAED and also flow of cash from all AGF’s
USD bank accounts. At the same time they are scrutinizing all Oxus’

255

loans and their purposes and necessity and comparing Oxus’s
cashflow from AGF against Oxus’s liability to the Ministry of Finance
trying to find out whether Oxus could have paid the specifical
dividend in 2008 to 2010.

There is no doubt that the information gathered will be used against
AGF/Oxus. In the best case, it can be used for quantifiying the
mismanagement and lead to reducing the proposed Oxus’ share sale
number or, in the worst case, it will be used to prepare a case for
taking the assets away without any payment.”

655. In or around February / March 2011, Respondent alleges that Oxus’ representative

656.

staff fled Uzbekistan (see Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 81) and that AGF failed
paying any taxes thereafter.

QOn_18 March 2011, Oxus wrote two letters, one to AGF and one to
Goskomgeology and NMMC complaining about the nature and scope of the 2011
Audit and declaring force majeure as follows (Exhs. C-406, C-408):

“[...] We hereby notify that we have become subject to a Force
Majeure event specified in section 7.2 of the Agreement.

As a result of the actions taken by the Government of the Republic of
Uzbekistan, ongoing operations of the Company are now impossible.
We have experienced a series of events, which are beyond our
reasonable control, which have made it impossible for us to comply
with any of our obligations under the Agreement, specifically to
perform any of the Services specified in section 2.3 of the Agreement.

Members of the government-led audit commission at the Company
have communicated to members of staff of the Company that they may
be subject to arrest for non-compliance with norms and directives. On
15 March 2011 the General Director of the Company nominated by us
was informed by his assistant that she could no longer send
information to him or communicate with him by telephone. The lack of
access to information has made it impossible for us to provide the
Company with technical and consultancy services relating to
corporate and project management, the arrangement, organisation,
coordination and management of construction, production and other
operations relating to the Project.

[...]”. (Exh. C-406, letter to AGF)

“We hereby notify you that we have become subject to a Force
Majeure event specified in section 17.1(c) of the Charter.

256

As a result of the actions taken by the Government of the Republic of
Uzbekistan, ongoing operations of the Company are now impossible.
We have experienced a series of events, which are beyond our
reasonable control, which have made it impossible for us to comply
with our obligations under the Charter. Specifically we are unable:
(i) to participate in managing the Company in accordance with
the procedures established by the Charter and Uzbek law
(section 7.2(b) of the charter); and

(ii) to fulfil other responsibilities as a shareholder including but
not limited to, payment obligations (section 17.1 of the
Charter).

tel
In accordance with section 17.2(c) of the Charter we propose that the
following steps are taken immediately to mitigate the Force Majeure:

- immediate release of Mr. Ashurov from prison;

- removal of the audit commission from the Company; and

- removal of the orders blocking our bank accounts.

[...]. (Exh. C-408, letter to Goskomgeology and NMMC)

657. On 20 March 2011, Sanoat issued a ‘Deed’ (Exh. R-218) concluding as follows
regarding its findings upon the Audit:

Conclusions:

During the inspection it was found out that the condition of industrial
safety, ecological state and conditions of subsurface resources
management are unsatisfactory.

Due to the fault of the administration of JV CJSC “Amantaytau
Goldfields” some gross violations of the Law in the sphere of
Environmental and Industrial Safety and in the sphere of Subsurface
Resources Management were effected.

Proposal for the Administration:
J. It is necessary to consider and discuss the present Deed at the

meeting of technical engineering personnel under control of the
General Director.

2. General Director of the enterprise shall take some urgent measures
for elimination of specified in this Deed violations of the Law of the
Republic of Uzbekistan that may influence life and health of people
and environment.

3. In accordance with article 9, paragraph 4 of the Occupational
Safety and Health Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan it is necessary to
suspend enterprise work till violations rectifying.” (Exh. R-218)

On 22 March 2011, the Ministry of Finance issued its own findings regarding
financial irregularities discovered during the Audit 2011 (Exh. R-96). Its 227
pages report, including appendices, identified alleged breaches by Claimant and
AGF of legislative and contractual obligations.

On 22 March 2011, ORC” sent a letter to Mr. Turamuratov of Goskomgeology
and Mr. Sanakulov of NMMC confirming its opposition to the efforts to liquidate
the company and reasserting its declaration of force majeure (Exh. C-409). The
letter contained in particular the following statements:

“Lod

We further note that we consider the proposal to liquidate the
Company, for which there are neither legal nor commercial grounds,
to be a part of the campaign of the Uzbek authorities to harass us and
our holding company, Oxus Gold plc and expropriate its investment in
the country.

Accordingly, any attempt to continue arrangements for the Meeting is
a continuation of the campaign and an aggravation of the dispute
under the [BIT].

The notice of dispute and proposal to enter into appropriate
negotiations under the [BIT] was communicated to the President of
Uzbekistan on 10 March 2011.

be]

We also note, that we oppose the convocation of the Meeting, and any
and all motions and proposals related to it. We will not attend the
Meeting and therefore the Meeting will be inquorate and not legally
effective. [...].”

On_30 March and 8 April 2011, an exchange of correspondence took place
between ORC and Goskomgeology, in which ORC complained again against the
2011 Audit and the fact that it was prevented from operating. Goskomgeology
insisted that an Extraordinary General Meeting of AGF be conveyed to discuss the
liquidation of the joint venture (Exhs. C-22, C-412).

On 20 April 2011, the State Tax Committee issued its ‘Report on the audit on
compliance with tax laws and other regulations at CJSC Amantaytau

Goldfields’ (hereinafter “2011 Audit Report”) (Exhs. C-404/R-479) listing the
various financial and operational irregularities discovered during the Audit.

On 11 May 2011, the State Tax Committee issued a Decree no. 09/1-2837 ‘On
eliminating the breaches of the tax legislation’ ordering Claimant to pay
financial penalties based on the finding of the 2001 Audit Report (Exhs. C-426/R-
481) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 324).

On 30 May 2011, the Zarafshan City Tax Committee filed a claim with the Navoi
Regional Economic Court for recovery of the fine imposed in the 2011 Audit of
UZS 16,014,427,700 (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 457). According to
Claimant, it was not notified of this claim, which was only notified to AGF (Exh.
C-415).

On 30 June and 29 July 2011, hearings were held before the Navoi Regional
Economic Court for recovery of the fine imposed in the 2011 Audit. It is disputed
to what extent Oxus was informed of such hearings (Exh. R-673).

On 30 September 2011, a further hearing was held before the Navoi Regional
Economic Court. By letter of 19 September 2011, ORC had requested that such
hearing be adjourned based on the fact that ORC had not yet received the
Statement of Claim filed by Zarafshan City Tax Committee (Exh. R-673). It
seems that the hearing nevertheless took place, though the judge adjourned the
hearing to 18 November 2011 due to the absence of ORC (Exh. R-676).

On 18 November 2011, the Navoi Regional Economic Court held a hearing and
issued its ‘Decision No. 21-1103/7987’ ruling in favour of the Zarafshan City Tax
Committee and ordered ORC to pay USD 8,5 million of fine (Exh. C-366):

“[...] the Court
HAS DECIDED:
To satisfy the applicant's petition in full.

To impose financial penalties to “Oxus Resources Corporation” on
ground of Article 113 of the Tax Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan,
in the amount of 16,014,427,700 Uzbek Soums.

To collect from “Oxus Resources Corporation” the amount of state
duty 497,350 Uzbek Soums to be payable to republic’s budget, Fund
for Development of Judiciaries and Justice Bodies.

To collect from “Oxus Resources Corporation” the cost of postal fees
3,500 Uzbek Soums payable to State Tax Inspectorate of Zarafshan

The parties who do not agree with this decision are entitled to appeal

The Filing for Arbitration

On 24 May 2011, Claimant notified Respondent of its intention to start arbitration
and to ultimately file a notice of arbitration on 31 August 2011 (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 456).

On 31 August 2011, Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration.

The Criminal Investigations Against Claimant’s Staff

Around March-April 2011, according to Claimant, Mr. Salamatin, a former
Director General of AGF, was forced to flee Uzbekistan because of persecution by
Respondent.

On 6 March 2011, Mr. Ashurov, AGF’s former Chief Metallurgist, was arrested
allegedly attempting to remove classified information from the Republic of
Uzbekistan relating to its mineral reserves. He was prosecuted by the National
Security Service, an agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, before a military
tribunal.

In May 2011, the Zarafshan Procurator’s Office for the Navoi Region began
criminal investigations against Mr. Yunusov, AGF’s Deputy General Director and
acting General Director, and Mr. Salamatin in relation to the tax payment and
accounting irregularities found in the 2011 Audit Report (Exh. R-534) (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 327).

On 2 August 2011, Mr. Chinkulov, the Prosecutor, decided to include Mr. Narziev
in the criminal investigation and, during the interview that day, Mr. Narziev
confessed to the crime of tax evasion (Exhs. R-536, R-537) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 328).

On 24 August 2011, Mr. Chinkulov also filed charges of tax evasion against Mr.
Yunusov, AGF’s Deputy General Director and acting General Director (R-542)
(Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 329). On the same day, Mr. Yunusov
confessed to the crime of tax evasion and promised to indemnify the State for the
damage caused by AGF’s illegal conduct (Exhs. R-543, R-544) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 329).

1.5.9

680.

681.

On 21 September 2011, as AGF failed to indemnify the State as promised by Mr.
Yunusoy, Mr. Chinkulov was granted a warrant for Mr. Yunusov’s arrest from the
Navoi City Court (Exhs. R-548-R-551) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 330).

On 4 October 2011, Mr. Chinkulov charged Messrs Narziev and Yunusov with
neglect of office under Article 207 of the Criminal Code and both confessed to
this crime (Exhs. R-554, R-555) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 330).

On 25 November 2011, Mr. Yunusov petitioned the Court to be released on bail
and was released on bail on the same day (Exh. R-563) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 331).

On 30 November 2011, Mr. Yunusov died of a stroke, hypertension and cerebral
haemorrhaging (Exh. R-568).

On 14 December 2011, on application of Mr. Narziev, the Navoi Court granted
him amnesty and dropped the charges against him (Exh. R-567) (Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 331).

On 25 January 2012, Mr. Chinkulov filed criminal charges in absentia against Mr.
Salamatin for, among other things, embezzlement in violation of Article 167 of
the Criminal Code and petitioned the court to enter a warrant for Mr. Salamatin’s
arrest, which the court granted (Exhs. R-568-R-572) (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 332). Mr. Salamatin not being in Uzbekistan, the warrant could
thus not be executed in Uzbekistan.

The Liquidation of AGF

On 27 August 2012, JSC Zarafshan-Shakhtastroy (hereinafter “Shakhtastroy”), a
sub-contractor of AGF hired to perform underground works and whose invoices
were unpaid — filed an application to commence involuntary bankruptcy
proceedings against AGF (Exh. R-339) (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 334).

On_21 September 2012, the Navoi Regional Economic Court accepted
Shakhtastroy’s application and placed AGF under supervision, during which time
a debtor’s property is secured and its financial situation is analysed to determine
the most appropriate course of action (Exh. R-340).

On _26 September 2012, the Navoi Regional Economic Court appointed Mr.
Narzullayev as both interim manager and acting General Director of AGF, who
proceeded with the liquidation proceedings (Exh. R-342). On 30 April 2013, Mr.
Kazakov replaced Mr. Narzullayev as Liquidation Manager (Exhs. C-706 and C-

261

68:

760) and ultimately on 4 March 2014, Mr. Bozorov was appointed as Liquidation
Manager (Exh. C-760).

Nv

. As of 10 November 2012, Claimant and the successive Liquidation Managers
exchanged a number of letters concerning the liquidation proceedings of AGF as
well as first, whether or not Claimant’s Atlas Copco drill rig formed part of AGF’s
assets to be liquidated and second, how could Claimant then recuperate the drill rig
(see Exhs. C-704-C-707 and C-740-C-767).

3. Further correspondence was exchanged between the Parties, which will be
examined where necessary in the Tribunal’s analysis.

Iv. The AGF Claims in a Nutshell
d. Claimant’s Claims
4. In short, Claimant claims that it did everything it could to make the AGF Project a

success and invested millions of US dollars. However, Respondent unduly
interfered with AGF’s operations and prevented Claimant from running AGF
profitably, in particular through the following key interferences:

@ Special Dividend Agreement of 2004: Once Claimant found
financing for Phase 1, which included the hedging of gold to Standard
Bank at a price of USD 320 per ounce, Respondent forced Claimant
into concluding the ‘Special Dividend Agreement’ under which Oxus
had to reimburse Respondent via regular payments of 50% of the
difference between the hedged price of gold and the higher spot price
of gold of USD 410 by paying this amount into a ‘Reserve Fund’. Until
the signing of this Agreement, Claimant was prevented from exporting
any precious metal. Claimant had an unconditional right to export gold
as guaranteed in various legal instruments, and thus Respondent’s
refusal to recognize the validity of the hedged price of gold was illegal,
as was Respondent’s blocking of exports of AGF’s gold so as to
unduly pressure Claimant into agreeing to the Special Dividend and
absorbing the price difference. Respondent eventually filed court
proceedings to enforce the amount due under the Special Dividend
Agreement of over USD 10,8 million, although it agreed to stay these
proceedings during the conduct of the arbitration proceedings (Claim.
PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 99 and thereto included references to earlier
submissions).

262

(ii)

(iii)

Refusal to approve the Feasibility Study for Phase 2 and to renew
necessary licenses: After the completion of Phase 1, Claimant worked
on a Feasibility Study for Phase 2, which was eventually issued by
WAI in June 2008. According to Claimant, Respondent refused to
approve this Feasibility Study, among others, because it claimed the
financing of Phase 2 was not sufficiently laid out in the Feasibility
Study. However, this put Claimant in a catch-22 position, because
Claimant could not obtain financing without first getting its Feasibility
Study approved. Thus, Respondent’s refusal to approve the Feasibility
Study prevented Claimant from obtaining advantageous financing. In
addition, after modifying the regime applicable for issuing mining
licenses by Decree No. 76, Respondent refused to renew Claimant’s
Exploration, Mining and Cyanide Licences, which caused additional
difficulty in obtaining financing and planning for Phase 2. This refusal
to issue or renew relevant licenses were all the more serious as
Respondent knew that it was hampering Claimant’s chances of
securing financing for Phase 2 (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 103
fol., and thereto included references to earlier submissions).

Changes in 2006, 2009 and 2011 of the Tax Regime: Claimant
further complains that Respondent modified the applicable tax regime
by revoking AGF’s exemption of VAT tax and other privileges
through the Decrees No. 477, No. 266, No. 74 and No. 133. By
revoking these privileges, Respondent breached prior commitments,
including the stabilization clause, and made it impossible for Claimant
to operate AGF profitably. As concerns the 2006 changes,
Respondent’s contentions that these privileges were not limited in time
and could therefore be limited, or that the revocation of such privileges
was justified by Claimant’s alleged underperformance, are artificial
and post-factum arguments without legal or factual basis (Claim. PHB
II. 21.08.2014, para. 108, and thereto included references to earlier
submissions). As concerns the 2009 changes, which affected the VAT
regime, these changes were also in breach of the stabilization clause
and were further discriminatory as they de facto applied only to
Claimant (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 109 fol., and thereto
included references to earlier submissions). As concerns the 2011
changes, these changes were done without providing legitimate
justification and made it impossible for CITIC or any other potential
financier to feel comfortable in supporting the investment (Claim. PHB
TI. 21.08.2014, para. 112, and thereto included references to earlier
submissions).

263

(iv)

(v)

Interference with operations through the 2006 and 2011 State
Audits and unjustified Court Proceedings: Claimant complains that
Respondent unduly interfered with AGF’s operations by conducting
two complex and time-consuming audits, which were partly without
legal basis and the conclusions of which were unfounded. After the
first State Audit in 2006, the State Tax Committee imposed a fine on
AGF and Oxus of over USD 225 million. While Claimant appealed
against this finding and eventually succeeded in annulling most of
them, AGF’s assets were frozen by the court and AGF was thereby
prevented from operating and paying its suppliers and other sub-
contractors. This caused major damage to AGF and Claimant (Claim.
PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 100 and thereto included references to
earlier submissions). The second State Audit, conducted in 2011, i.e.
only two days after the new tax regime came into effect on 1 January
2011, had no legal basis and was conducted under undue pressure on
AGF’s employees, including disproportionate searches, abuse of AGF
employees, aggressive interrogations, intimidation and threats of
imprisonment. In addition, it had the result of turning off financial
institutions which were potentially interested in financing Phase 2,
including RBS, Nedbank and the CITIC Consortium. These events
eventually caused Claimant to declare force majeure on 18 March
2011, shortly before several expatriate employees of AGF had to leave
Uzbekistan out of fear for their safety (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014,
paras. 114 fol., and thereto included references to earlier submissions).

Interference with operations by forcing AGF to sub-contract the
Silver Refining to AMGK: Respondent forced AGF to refine silver at
AMGK’’s Silver Refinery, even though AMGK was not able to comply
with the requested quality standards and refine sufficient quantities of
silver. While Claimant found a company, Metalor of Switzerland,
which could refine the doré bars of AGF, Respondent refused that
Claimant do so and requested that it first organize a cumbersome
tender, which could not take place within the time frame requested.
Even where AGF was under heavy financial pressure, Respondent
refused that Claimant proceed with a one-off sale of certain silver
quantities without organizing first a tender for the sale of such silver
(Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 102 and thereto included references
to earlier submissions).

264

685.

686.

(vi) Initiation of criminal investigations against AGF staff: After the
issuance of the 2011 Audit Report, the prosecutor of Navoi Region,
Mr. Chinkulov, started criminal investigations against three employees
of AGF, Mr. Yunusof, AGF’s Deputy Director, Mr. Narziev, AGF’s
Chief Accountant and Mr. Salamatin. While Mr. Yunusof and Mr.
Narziev were forced to confess to certain crimes, Mr. Salamatin fled to
Kazakhstan and then to his home country, Russia, out of fear for his
safety. Mr. Yunusof died a few days after having been released on bail.
According to Claimant, these investigations were part of an
intimidation scheme organized by Respondent (Claim. PHB II.
21.08.2014, paras. 115 fol., and thereto included references to earlier
submissions).

(vii) | Undue pressure to voluntarily liquidate AGF and the initiation of
formal liquidation proceedings: Claimant further complains that it
was put under undue pressure by Goskomgeology and NMMC to
liquidate AGF, whilst most of the debt of AGF was actually owed to
Claimant itself. After Claimant resisted the pressure to put AGF into
voluntary liquidation, Respondent arranged for an Uzbek sub-
contractor of AGF, Shakhtastroy, to commence bankruptcy
proceedings. These liquidation proceedings were and are still
conducted irregularly and eventually deprived Claimant of its
investment in AGF (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 113 and 119,
and thereto included references to earlier submissions).

According to Claimant, these acts and omissions of Uzbekistan have led to the
unlawful expropriation, or equivalent measure thereto, or alternatively to the
unlawful creeping expropriation of Claimant’s investment in AGF, and in any
event to an expropriation or a measure equivalent thereto without prompt,
adequate, and effective compensation, in breach of Article 5 of the BIT (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1266; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 64).

Alternatively, Claimant contends that each of these acts and omissions
constitutive of expropriation or equivalent thereto also constitute individually, let
alone collectively, a breach of the following obligations of Respondent under the
BIT (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1267 fol.):

(i) Breach of the FET standard for breach of Claimant’s legitimate
expectations, lack of transparency and breach of good faith obligations;

(ii) Breach of the obligation not to impose unreasonable and arbitrary
measures on Claimant;

265

(iii) Breach of the obligation to provide full protection and security for
Claimant’s investments;

(iv) Breach of the umbrella clause through the failure to observe
specific undertakings towards Claimant, in particular in connection with the
revocation of tax privileges and the refusal to issue and renew AGF’s
licenses;

(v) Breach of the obligation not to impose discriminatory measures
on Claimant, in particular with regard to the revocation of tax privileges and
Special Dividend Agreement.

687. Finally, Claimant also contends that separate breaches of these obligations have

688.

also been committed by Respondent in relation to (i) the Guarantee Letters and
the Special Dividend Agreement, (ii) the purchase of the silver refinery, (iii), the
purchase of the drill rig, and further give rise to separate and additional claims
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1268).

Based thereon, Claimant requests a total amount of approx. USD 552 million,
composed of the following sub-parts (see above para. 133):

(i) USD 431,8 million as compensation for the loss suffered in relation to
the AGF Deposit Phase 1 and Phase 2 (this claim is based on a valuation
date as of the date of the award and a full expropriation scenario; Claimant
has filed various alternative claims set out above in para. 133);

(ii) USD 2,562,599.99 as compensation for expropriation of the Atlas Copco
drill rig;

(iii) USD 752,385.47 for the silver refinery purchased from Italy;

(iv) USD 117 million for loss sustained by Claimant due to its deprivation
of the exploration area adjacent to the AGF Deposit; and

(v) USD 2 million for moral damages.

Respondent’s Defense and Counter Claims

689. In contrast, Respondent rejects all of Claimant’s claims.

690. Firstly, Respondent contends that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction

over Claimant’s claims in respect to the AGF Project, which is grounded in

266

691.

misrepresentation, fraud, illegality or bad faith (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013,
para. 354; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 865; Transcripts of 28 April 2014,
185:24 - 186:2; Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 7 fol.). According to
Respondent, Claimant procured its investment in AGF (i) by misrepresenting its
financial capacity to finance Phase | of the AGF Project through its own or raised
funds without burdening AGF with interest-bearing loans, (ii) through funds that
it obtained as ill-gotten gains from securities fraud, in violation of its duties of
good faith, disclosure, and candor, as well as applicable currency laws, and (iii)
once the State approved its investment in AGF, Claimant then caused the
investment to fail and unjustly enriched itself and its affiliates through self-
dealing, fraud, and other serious violations of Uzbek law (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 848). For all these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal should find
that it does not have jurisdiction over this dispute and that all of Claimant’s claims
are inadmissible.

Secondly, Claimant’s claims would fail on the merits because Respondent was
fully justified, either as a result of Claimant’s own failures or violations of law, or
for other valid reasons, in carrying out all of the acts about which Claimant now
complains:

(i) Claimant structured the JV so that it could manage AGF inefficiently and it
would profit from inflated, related-party transactions (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, paras. 140 fol., 176 fol.). As a result, Claimant and its affiliates
made significantly more money than Claimant projected in its Feasibility
Study, without making any substantial investment, while Respondent made
far less money than Claimant projected and only approximately half of what
Claimant made. Claimant thus enjoyed the full benefit of its alleged
investment (Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 11).

(ii) | AGF’s privileges and benefits, including its stabilization guarantee, were
conditioned on its compliance with Uzbek law, as well as on its proper
implementation of the Project. However, AGF repeatedly failed to comply
with the approved technical and economic parameters of the Project, and
thus was in default of the obligations on which its privileges and benefits
were conditioned. The State thus determined that AGF’s privileges and
benefits no longer were justified and should be revoked (Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, para. 14, Transcript of 1 May 2014, 834:20 — 836:11 [Mrs.
Malkina]).

(iii) | AGF’s failures are not attributable to Respondent, but rather to Claimant’s
own self-dealing, fraud, theft and mismanagement (Resp. PHB _ II.
21.08.2014, para. 11).

267

692. As concerns the legal arguments brought forward by Claimant:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

As concerns Claimant's claim for expropriation: Respondent did not
expropriate any investment of Claimant in AGF, because Claimant’s
investment in AGF was its 50% shareholding, which Claimant continues to
hold today. Respondent’s actions, moreover did not deprive Claimant of the
management, use, control, or value of its investment. Claimant, through its
management and control of AGF, fully exhausted all of the easily accessible
and close-to-surface oxide ores Phase 1, and caused AGF to go bankrupt. In
respect to Phase 2, Claimant never presented an economically acceptable and
Bankable Feasibility Study, and thus never obtained any rights to develop
Phase 2 (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 866).

As concerns Claimant's claim for breach of FET and arbitrary and
unreasonable measures: Respondent did not violate its obligations because
all of Respondent’s actions were reasonable and justified in the
circumstances, and complied fully with Uzbek law (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 887 fol.).

As concerns Claimant’s claims for discriminatory treatment: Claimant’s
claims of unreasonable and arbitrary measures fail, because, in taking the
corrective measures that it took with respect to AGF, Respondent acted in all
respects within its legal rights, for rational reasons, and did not act
disproportionately or contrary to the rule of law. In addition, Claimant failed
to establish that the incriminated measures were directed specifically against
Claimant by reason of its nationality (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 913
fol.).

As concerns Claimant’s claim for breach of the FPS standard: This standard
concerns the host State’s obligation to exercise reasonable care in protecting
the investment from the actions of third parties, and applies essentially
“when the foreign investment has been affected by civil strife and physical
violence” (see Saluka v. Czech Republic, para. 483 (Exh. RL-291)) In the
present case, this standard does not apply, because Claimant has not alleged,
not has there been, any physical seizure or physical interference with its
investment in AGF by a third party (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 922
fol.).

268

693

694.

(v) | As concerns Claimant’s claim for breach of the umbrella clause : The
umbrella clause is not applicable because Claimant is not a party to any of
the instruments on which it relies for its umbrella clause claims. The
obligations assumed in these instruments run only to AGF, and not to
Claimant. In other words, there is no undertaking to be honored by
Respondent with respect to Claimant in those instruments. In addition, the
concerned matters are of purely contractual nature and do not rise to the
level of treaty claims (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 927 fol.).

. As concerns Claimant’s damage claim, Respondent contends that it should be
rejected for it is speculative and further based upon flawed data and analysis
(Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 58 fol.). In addition, Claimant’s claim for moral
damage is without legal or factual basis (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 972
fol.).

Respondent further raises a counter-claim in the amount of USD 109 million in
compensation for damages caused by Claimant’s misconduct, including (i)
Claimant’s misrepresentations as to financing of the AGF Joint Venture; (ii)
Claimant’s waste of natural resources; (iii) Claimant’s breach of the Special
Dividend Agreement; (iv) Claimant’s engagement in self-dealing and related-
party transactions; and (v) Claimant’s currency law violations and corresponding
failure to provide promised foreign currency and other benefits. Respondent
requests that this Counter-claim be set off with any award of damages granted to
Claimant (Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 61 fol.).

v. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis

L. The Key Issues

695

. In view of the Parties’ positions, the Arbitral Tribunal considers the following
questions to be key in assessing Claimant’s claims over the AGF Project:

(i) With regard to Claimant’s claims:
(1) Are Claimant’s claims admissible?

(2) If so, do the above-mentioned alleged key interferences by the Uzbek
State amount to an expropriation, either direct or indirect, in the sense of
Article 5 of the BIT?

269

(3) (a) If expropriation, was this expropriation justified or not? What are the
consequences of such finding on the duty to compensate?

(b) If no expropriation, do these interferences individually or collectively
constitute a breach of (i) the FET under Article 2 of the BIT including
the prohibition of unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory action, (ii)
the FPS standard under Article 2 of the BIT, and/or (iii) the umbrella
clause of Article 2(2) in fine of the BIT?

(4) If breach of the BIT, what is the appropriate measure of damages to be
afforded to Claimant? And, in particular, is Claimant entitled to moral
damages ?

(ii) | With regard to Respondent’s counter-claims:

(5) Does the Arbitral Tribunal have jurisdiction over Respondent’s counter-
claims? If so, are these counter-claims well founded?

(6) If so, what is the appropriate amount of damage to be afforded to
Respondent and to what extent can this amount be set-off with the
amount of damages, if any, to be afforded to Claimant?

(7) In case of damages awarded to Claimant, what interests — if any — apply
thereon ?

2. With Regard to Claimant’s Claims

2.1 Issue No. 1: Admissibility of Claimant’s Claims

2.1.1 The Parties’ Positions

2.1.1.1 Respondent's Position

696. According to Respondent, Claimant’s claims with respect to the AGF Phase 1
should be rejected on jurisdictional and admissibility grounds (Transcripts of 28
April 2014, 185:24 - 186:2; see Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, section III and Resp.
PHB II. 21.08.2014, section IV; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 840 fol.).

697. Respondent justifies its position based on the following four main arguments:

270

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

Claimant made its alleged investment in AGF through misrepresentations
and its IPO fraud (Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 23 fol.): Claimant
misrepresented to Respondent that the entire AGF Project would be financed
by Oxus through equity financing and by providing AGF with interest-free
loans without attracting bank debt financing. Claimant breached this
commitment, which was contemplated in Decree No. 266, by concluding a
loan agreement with Standard Bank, which did not require equity, and
instead resulted in onerous lending conditions, including hedging for AGF.
In addition, Claimant also made its investment through securities fraud and
violation of the UK securities regulations, as established by the judgment of
the High Court of Justice of England and Wales of 27 April 2006 (Exh.
R-500).

Claimant obtained ill-gotten profits and deprived AGF and Respondent of
foreign currency revenue through fraudulent self-dealing (Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, paras. 29 fol.): The Uzbek State never received from AGF the
dividends and economic benefits that Claimant promised. According to
Respondent, Claimant represented that based on the Amended Phase 1
Feasibility Study of 24 January 2003 (see above para. 427), the State would
receive USD 37,54 million in dividends during Phase 1, based on projected
revenues of USD 223.30 million. Although AGF earned USD 314,58 million
during Phase 1 — USD 91 million more than projected — AGF declared only
USD 4,60 million in dividends for the Uzbek parties, and paid only USD
3,66 million of that amount. While Claimant thus made many millions of
dollars, without investing any cash, AGF struggled to maintain solvency
under Claimant’s management. According to Respondent, this was the result
of Claimant’s exaggerated management fees which arose out of Claimant’s
self-dealing with related entities such as MAED, BCM and BDO Isle of
Man.

Claimant obtained ill-gotten profits and deprived AGF and Respondent of
foreign currency revenue through the MRT slush fund (Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, para. 43 fol.): The relationship between AGF and MRT was a
related-party relationship and the MRT Consulting Contract concluded
between them a sham contract serving to divert foreign exchange revenue
from AGF and Respondent into a slush fund for Claimant. Claimant used
this fund to pay bonuses to insiders and not to provide legitimate services to
AGF under the MRT Consulting Contract, which Claimant moreover failed
to submit to the General Meeting of the Shareholders for approval or to
register with an authorized bank as required under Uzbek law. In addition,
payments made to MRT exceeded the maximum value contemplated by the
MRT Consulting Contract and its amendments, an irregularity which was
spotted during the 2006 Audit (see above paras. 484, 535) and which

271

(iv)

Claimant tried to hide by attempting to destroy relevant invoices from MRT
(see Wilkins, Transcripts of 29 April 2014, 384:3 - 384:6).

Claimant operated AGF in violation of Respondent’s currency laws (Resp.
PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 52): Before Decree No. 266 was issued, granting
Claimant any right to participate in the AGF Joint Venture, Claimant was
notified and understood the restrictions of Uzbek law regarding AGF’s use
of its foreign currency as contemplated in the Law on Currency Regulations
(see above para. 38) and expressed in the Central Bank’s communications
(see above para. 50, 406 and 556). Notwithstanding these restrictions,
Claimant continued to manage its foreign currency and in particular the
Barclays Bank Account in violation of thereof, namely by paying itself and
its affiliates for imported goods and services through this offshore bank
account, rather than through an authorized Uzbek bank as required by law.

698. In light of Claimant’s substantial violation of law which relate directly to the
manner in which Claimant obtained and implemented its investment in AGF, and
in particular taking into account the duration and scope of unlawful activity, as
well as the harm caused to the State, Claimant cannot invoke Treaty protection for
its illegality-infused investment based on the following main legal principles
(Resp. PHB IL. 21.08.2014, para. 59; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 841 fol.):

(i)

(ii)

An investment procured in violation of host State law or in violation of the
fundamental requirements of good faith and fair dealing is not entitled to the
protections of investment treaties and international arbitration, even where
the applicable treaty does not contain an express legality clause requiring
compliance with host State law (see e.g. Quiborax v. Bolivia and Metal-Tech
v. Uzbekistan). In casu, although the BIT does not expressly provide for a
legality clause, it does in Article 2(1) of the BIT recognize the importance of
host State law and the Republic’s Law on Foreign Investment further
expressly conditions the extension of benefits and protections on the
investor’s compliance with host State law. Thus, consistent with
international law and public policy, the Republic’s regime for the protection
of foreign investment is available only to investments that are obtained in
accordance with Uzbek law (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 844); and

A claimant with unclean hands may not seek relief for claims arising out of
its own unlawful conduct.

699. Under similar circumstances, numerous tribunals in commercial and investment
treaty arbitrations have rejected claims grounded in misrepresentation, fraud,
illegality or bad faith (see Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, Plama v. Bulgaria;
Inceysa v. El Savlador; World Duty Free v. Kenya; SIREXM v. Burkina Faso;

272

700.

701.

702.

703.

Hamester v. Ghana, SAUR v. Argentina; Quiborax v. Bolivia) (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 843 fol.).

For all these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant’s AGF
claims (as Respondent did not consent to arbitrate disputes arising out of
investments that were made or operated in violation of its laws) and/or those
claims are inadmissible (Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 7; Resp. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 22).

2.1.1.2 Claimant's Position

Claimant rejects Respondent’s factual and legal allegations underlying its
jurisdictional objections.

As concerns the argument of misrepresentation, Claimant contends that this
argument is artificial as it was raised long after the fact and was never raised by
Respondent during the implementation of the Project or even in the early written
legal submissions. Thus, this argument should be dismissed right away. In
addition, in order to succeed with this argument, Respondent would need to
establish that the alleged misrepresentation actually related to a ‘material fact’,
which was intended to induce Respondent to host an investment that it otherwise
would not have accepted, and that Respondent actually relied on the
misrepresented information when making its decision to allow Claimant to
become a majority shareholder of the joint venture. However, Respondent failed
in the very first step of this test, as it has not shown that Claimant ever represented
that it would finance Phase | exclusively through equity and not through any
other means. In fact, it arises out of various key documents, such as the Decree
No. 266, the Decree No. 477, the AGF Charter, AGF Minutes of General
Shareholders Meetings, public statements made in Claimant’s AIM listing
prospectus, State correspondence (e.g. Exhs. C-597, R-1096. R-421, R-422) that
Respondent was well aware that Claimant intended to use debt finance and
Respondent never once raised this as an issue or claimed that it had been deceived
into allowing the investment on the basis of any purported misrepresentation
(Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 68 fol.).

As concerns Respondent's reliance on other purported illegalities, including
securities fraud and related-parties transactions, even if — arguendo — the Arbitral
Tribunal were to consider that there were illegalities in the making of Claimant’s
investment (which Claimant denies), then Respondent still failed to establish that
any of these alleged wrongdoings took place at the inception of Claimant’s Uzbek
investment or were instrumental in securing the investment so as to deprive the
Arbitral Tribunal of competence or render the claims inadmissible under the very
high “illegality threshold” (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 74).

273

704. In particular:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

The UK High Court decision did not make any finding of securities fraud,
nor did any other financial institution make such finding, nor for that matter
White & Case who were back then involved as representatives of Zeromax
(Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 73 fol.).

As concerns the allegations of exaggerated management fees, these fees
charged by Oxus were discussed and agreed with Respondent (Exh. C-606)
and in any event they were not “exorbitant”, but rather were the necessary
and reasonable result of having to adapt to the increased costs of producing
gold when, after the start of production, it became clear that the quality of
the ore was not what it was expected to be, thus triggering higher operating
costs which are not in any way the result of alleged and uproven self-
dealing. Claimant had no incentive whatsoever to inflate AGF’s operating
costs, as this would be very short-sighted and naturally hamper bringing
Phase 2 into life, and thus harm Claimant’s interest in the investment in the
same way as it would harm Respondent’s (Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para.
79).

As concerns the allegations of self-dealing with MAED, the payment
irregularities were discussed and settled at AGF’s General Shareholders
Meeting of October 2003 (see above para. 436). As concerns Respondent’s
allegations with regard to BDO, they would be simply unfounded (see
Claimant’s letter of 25 July 2014; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 80 and
81; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 508 fol.).

As concerns the allegations with regard to the MRT ‘slush fund’ they are
also unfounded. The dealings with MRT were legitimate contractual
arrangements designed to allow AGF to employ expatriate workers required
for the Project, and occasional overpayment issues were dealt with and
settled between the shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting of 15 June
2006 (Exh. C-626) (see Wilkins, Transcripts of 29 April 2014, 382:24 -
383:15; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 536 fol.).

274

(v) As concerns the allegations that Claimant operated AGF in violation of

2.1.2

705.

706.

707.

Respondent’s foreign currency laws, this issue was also settled between the
Parties, in particular through the letter of the Central Bank of 7 March 2008.
Even if the Arbitral Tribunal considered that there was some instance of
illegality or impropriety by Claimant, it also fell to the State, represented by
the Uzbek Parties, as the 50% shareholder to cooperate with and assist
Claimant to manage AGF in compliance with Uzbek law. However
Respondent failed to provide such assistance. Finally, any finding of
impropriety could in any event not be used to invalidate Claimant’s claims
since they do not go to the making of the investment, but rather to the
measure of damages to which Claimant would be entitled to (Claim. PHB II.
21.08.2014, paras. 84 fol.; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 552 fol.,
698 fol.).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

2.1.2.1 The Applicable Legal Standard

Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections are based on three main
arguments relating to (i) Claimant’s alleged misrepresentation regarding the
means of financing of the AGF Project, (ii) Claimant’s obtaining of allegedly ill-
gotten profits through illegal self-dealings and transactions aimed at increasing
operating costs and reducing tax revenue, as well as (iii) Claimant’s breach of
relevant currency regulations. Under these circumstances, Respondent contends
that Claimant’s investment does not qualify for protection under the BIT and that
the Tribunal therefore either lacks jurisdiction or that Claimant’s claims are
inadmissible.

The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the analysis made in Phoenix Action v. Czech
Republic (Exh. RL-280, paras. 101 fol.), Plama v. Bulgaria (Exh. RL-281, paras.
138 fol.), Inceysa v. El Salvador (Exh. RL-251, paras. 229 fol.), Hamester v.
Ghana (Exh. RL-242, para. 123), SAUR v. Argentina (RL-292, para. 308) that an
investment may not qualify for protection under a BIT, where such investment
was made in breach of relevant laws and regulations, including international
treaties but also national law of the host State.

In order to lose the protection under the BIT, it is however necessary, as largely
agreed in the above cited cases, that the illegality affects the “making”, i.e. arises
when initiating the investment itself and not just when implementing and/or
operating it (see in particular Hamester v. Ghana (Exh. RL-242, para. 127) and
Inceysa v. El Salvador (Exh. RL-251, para. 239)).

711.

2.1.2.2 The Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case

Among the three types of reproaches formulated by Respondent, only the first
one, i.e. the misrepresentation regarding the type of financing that Oxus would
resort to, relates to the period before or during which Oxus made its investment,
i.e. acquired its shares in AGF.

As such, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that only this argument is relevant to
determine whether Claimant’s investment qualifies for protection under the BIT.
As concerns Respondent’s contentions regarding allegedly ill-gotten profits
through the unlawful operation of AGF and the violation of currency regulations,
they are irrelevant for the issue of jurisdiction or admissibility. They may
nevertheless be relevant when assessing the justifiable character of certain of
Respondent’s actions, which Claimant claims are in breach of the BIT protection
standards or as an element of the evaluation of damages and will thus, to the
extent necessary, be examined in such contexts (see below para. 714).

The relevant period for the question of admissibility of Claimant’s claim is
therefore the period extending from August 1999 (see above para. 47 when ORC
entered into the share purchase agreement with Lonrho to July 2001, when Oxus
acquired all of ORC’s share capital (see above para. 57) after ORC signed the
Revised AGF Charter (1) with the Uzbek Parties in July 2000 (see above para.
52).

‘When examining the relevant documents issued and signed during this period, it
appears that whilst such evidence shows an intent of Oxus to use equity financing
as important means of financing, Claimant did not provide a formal commitment
to only resort to such kind of financing. On the contrary, various relevant
documents expressly refer to “loans” and “debt financing” as alternative ways of
financing:

(60) AGF’s internal documents expressly referred to both types of financing
as follows:

e Clause 2.2 lit. (B) (c) of the Revised AGF Charter (1) provided as
one of the activities of the Joint Venture “to provide equity
capital from the shareholders and loan finance from
international fi ial instituti and cial banks
required in connection with the objectives of the activity of the
Company” (emphasis added) (see above para. 52) (Exh. C-212);

e The Minutes of the AGF’s General Shareholders’Meeting of 28
July 2000, during which Mr. Turner reported about “the situation

276

with bankable feasibility study (FS) of AGF for the Stage 1 and
proposed work program for completion of the FS and debt
financing” and expressly referred to the need to obtain “debt
financing”, (see above para. 457) (Exh. R-400).

e The CSMA Bankable Feasibility Study for Phase 1 of 11 August
2000 provided that “[uJngeared, the cash cost of production per
ounce is $112, the direct production cost is $177.24, and the total
(taxed) cost is $202. This implies a break-even gold price for the
Project of approximately $225 per ounce, if contingency is
allowed for shareholder or bank loan interest.” (Exhs. R-
281/C-526, emphasis added) (see above para. 408).

(ii) Various documents issued by Respondent also referred to the possibility
of resorting to loan financing:

e Decree No. 477 of 22 September 1994 envisaged in Article 2 that
“the creation of the enterprise will be carried out by subscriptions
of foreign participants and bank credits which are obtained by
the Joint Venture” and Article 4 further provided the Joint
Venture the right “to receive and repay credits in freely
convertible currency, and to secure such credits with the Joint
Venture’s property in accordance with the Legislation of the
Republic of Uzbekistan” (emphasis added) (Exh. C-215; see
above para. 39);

e Decree No. 266 of 11 July 2000 provided in Article 4 that as
concerns the implementation of the Project “the capital costs at
the first stage represent 53.1 million US dollars and can be made
by Oxus Resources Corporation in the form of direct investments
from its own and attracted funds” (Exh. C-213; emphasis
added), whereby it shall be noted that Respondent’s translation
of this document refers to “raised funds” instead of “attracted
funds” (Exh. R-573). The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider
this difference in wording to be crucial, since even the terms
“raised funds” may include loan financing. This is all the more
so, as Mr. Maksudov’s letter of 1 August 2000 addressed to ORC
and AGF (see above para. 408) and interpreting Decree No. 266
specifically stated that: “[Decree No. 266] does not restrict
[AGF] in obtaining loans from a third party provided any such
loans obtained to conduct the JV activity at stage I are arranged
by [ORC] and do not require guarantees of the Government of
the Republic of Uzbekistan.” (emphasis added) (Exh. C-597).

277

(iii) Various correspondence with the Uzbek Government also included
mentions of debt financing:

e Goskomgeology’s letter of 18 June 2001 to the CabMin reported
about the status of financing of the Project and provided that
“t]he negotiations with Barclays Bank and Société Générale
Bank on the loan for the project are in the final stage (issues of
the bank interest rate for the loan are being discussed)” and “[s]o
far, the Ministry of Finance and the State Tax Committee are
pending the Provision on taxation of “Amantaytau Goldfields”
JV, which is required to be submitted to the banks for obtaining
loans.” (emphasis added) (Exh. R-1096) (see above para. 412).

e The CabMin’s letter of April 2002, referring to Decree No. 266
and Oxus’ listing in June 2001, informed the Prime Minister, Mr.
Sultanov, on various financing issues and stated among others as
follows: “[t]o arrange implementation of I Stage of the project,
which envisages construction of facilities to process I million
tonnes of oxides and average production rate of 2.1 tonnes of
gold a year, the investor has negotiated to get a loan from
Société Générale Bank in the amount of US$31 million. On 2
April this year SocGen signed a written commitment to give the
JV US$31 million loan” (emphasis added) (Exh. C-421).

712. Referring to this correspondence, it is noteworthy that none of the evidence
submitted by the Parties reflect any contemporaneous complaint by Respondent
regarding such debt financing. Respondent either directly or through the Uzbek
Parties was aware of the loan financing, and yet it did not raise this as an issue.
Thus, even if there had been an expectation on Respondent’s side that Claimant
would resort solely to equity financing (which does not appear as being the case),
Respondent has in any event failed to establish that it relied on such expectation.
Respondent had certainly a reasonable expectation to make profit out of the AGF
Project and it is undisputed that this expectation was ultimately not met, for which
Respondent partly blames the heavy loan financing between Oxus and AGF.
However, this does not affect the ‘legality’ of the investment as such, and is a
question that relates to how Claimant was operating AGF and to whether such
operation may have justified certain interventions by Respondent which Claimant
contends constitute breaches of the BIT protection standards. As such, the
question of the appropriateness of the ways in which Claimant operated AGF is a
question which relates to the merits of the case and not to the issues of jurisdiction
or admissibility.

278

2.1.3 Conclusion

713. In conclusion, Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections towards
Claimant’s AGF claims are unfounded and hereby rejected. Claimant’s AGF
claims are admissible and the Tribunal has jurisdiction thereover.

2.2 Issue No. 2: Do Respondent’s Actions and Omissions Amount to an
Expropriation in the Sense of Article 5 of the BIT?

2.2.1 The Parties’ Positions

2.2.1.1 Claimant’s Position

714. According to Claimant, Uzbekistan commited a textbook unlawful expropriation
of Claimant’s investement in AGF, in breach of Article 5 of the BIT.

715. Claimant contends that the February-March 2011 Audit alone constituted a
decisive act of de facto expropriation under international law, let alone when
assessed with the other acts and omissions that occurred, be it during the prior six
months period, or throughout the longer preceding period of the Audit, as it led to
the cessation of work and deprived Claimant of the use, enjoyment and value of
its property — and this irrespective of whether this was intended and/or in
compliance with domestic laws (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1270;
Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 137). These acts included in particular the
following elements (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1271):

(i) The decision to conduct the 2011 Audit was not duly motivated
by the relevant State organs and thus in breach of Article 12 of Law No.
717-1;

(ii) The failure of Respondent to issue and/or renew Claimant’s

licenses, which led Claimant to a state of incapacity to conduct its mission
and which constitutes de facto expropriation (Metalclad v. Mexico (CL-93)
& Tecmed v. Mexico (CL-80));

(iii) The failure of Respondent to provide Claimant with good faith
assistance to close financing and the acts it committed during the relevant
period, i.e., September to December 2010, which led to the failure of the
Project financing by CITIC.

279

716.

717.

718.

719.

These acts led to the 18 March 2011 declaration of force majeure, namely
Claimant’s deprivation of the management, use, control and value of its
investment in AGF, and justifies in and of itself a finding of expropriation against
Respondent. It is irrelevant under international law whether the above acts by
Respondent were driven by bad intentions. The same applies as to whether or not
these acts comply with local laws. What matters is international law, which
considers the impact of the acts in question, which in the present case have clearly
deprived Claimant of the use, enjoyment and value of its investment (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1272; Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 137 fol.).

This finding of an unlawful expropriation is moreover reinforced if considered in
the light of Respondent’s other acts and omissions which occurred during the
previous period. Respondent’s earlier breaches of the BIT progressively weakened
Claimant’s position from all perspectives, including legally, financially and
commercially, at the time it came to be confronted with Respondent’s acts and
omissions occurring during the September 2010 to March 2011 period and thus
reduced the possibility, if any, of mitigation thereof or resistance thereto (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1273).

Alternatively, Claimant submits that Respondent, through its acts and omissions
during the September 2010 to March 2011 period taken together with the prior
acts and omissions, namely those occurred from 2004 to 2010, and in particular
those in 2006 (see Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 120 fol.) committed an
unlawful creeping expropriation, which justifies a finding of expropriation under
Article 5 of the BIT. In other words, the cumulative effect of these acts and
omissions was the substantial deprivation of the management, use, control and
value of Claimant’s investment by March 18, 2011, the date of Claimant’s
declaration of force majeure.

These acts and omissions include inter alia the following (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, paras. 1274 fol.):

(i) MinFin’s objections against the hedging provision in the Amended
Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement and the blocking of the export of
gold pending a decree on this matter, which led Claimant to default on
its payment obligations under the Amended Hedged Gold Offtake
Agreement and to incur further debts and losses;

(ii) MinFin’s imposing of the Guarantee Letters and Special Dividend

Agreement upon Claimant, and NMMC’s and Goskomgeology’s
failure to assist in this regard;

280

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

(vii)

The failure or refusal of Sanoat in 2006 to renew AGF’s Mining
License after its expiry on November 27, 2006, as required under
Article 8 of Decree No. 266, Section 7.2I of the AGF Charter, and
under its obligations of good faith, cooperation and loyalty, as well as
its specific undertakings under the BIT, and NMMC’s and
Goskomgeology’s failure to assist in this regard;

The issuance in 2006 by the CabMin of Decree No. 74 and Decree
No. 133 revoking the special privileges and exemptions under
previous Decrees No. 477 and No. 266, as confirmed by Regulation
No. 76;

The carrying out of the Complex State Audit 2006, and imposing on
AGF an extraordinary, idiosyncratic, arbitrary, nonsensical and
grossly unjust liability of approximately USD 225 million, which
caused much disruption to AGF’s operations as well as financial
losses, and the pursuit by the State Tax Committee and the Uzbek
judiciary of the enforcement of this unjust liability, and NMMC”s and
Goskomgeology’s failure to assist in this regard;

The unreasonable insistence by Goskomgeology and NMMC in 2007
that AGF’s unrefined silver be refined in Uzbekistan, thereby forcing
it to contract with AMGK, an unsuitable and costly refining partner
lacking the required refining capacity;

Goskomgeology’s failure or refusal to ensure the granting of the
Sarybatyr License for the mining of the gold desposit in Sarybatyr in
2008;

(viii) Respondent’s refusal to allow Claimant or AGF to export unrefined

(ix)

silver in contradiction notably with Claimant’s legitimate
expectations, based on Respondent’s specific undertakings under
Article 4 of Decree No. 477, Article 10 of the Foreign Investment
Law, and Article 2(2) of the BIT, causing cash flow problems and
suspending mining activities;

The Uzbek Parliament’s amendment of particular articles of the Tax
Code in 2009 to remove AGF’s “zero rating” and replace it with
“exempt status” for VAT purposes, which increased certain of AGF’s
capital and operating costs by 20% and further weakened its legal and
financial position, thus jeopardizing the advanced project financing
transaction contemplated for Phase 2 with RBS as Claimant had
warned Respondent;

281

(x) MinFERIT’s refusal to approve the Phase 2 Feasibility Study,
submitted in February 2009, on the unjustified grounds that AGF had
not yet provided executed contracts for financing, services and
supplies;

(xi) The failures caused by the above acts and omissions of Respondent on
the RBS and Nedbank financing that collapsed in 2009 as a result of
the above;

(xii) MinFin’s continual refusal to accept any offset or substitute payment
proposed by Claimant since 2009 for its USD 10,8 million liability
under the Special Dividend Agreement and NMMC’s and
Goskomgeology’s failure to assist in this regard;

(xiii) MinFin’s decision to initiate proceedings on September 23, 2010
before the Tashkent Economic Court against Claimant for payment of
Claimant’s USD 10,8 million liability under the Special Dividend
Agreement and Respondent’s denial of justice with regard to the
conduct of these proceedings;

(xiv) The refusal by the liquidation managers of AGF to return the Atlas
Copco drill rig worth USD 2.5 million to Claimant (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, paras. 1339 fol.; Exh. C-699 and compare to C-765).

720. These acts and omissions “directly caused both direct monetary damages, adverse

721.

consequences to AGF’s cash flow and ultimately the inability of Claimant to
secure the funding on behalf of AGF in order to proceed with the lucrative second
phase of underground mining.” (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 118). The acts of
Respondent listed above “combined to force the result that operations were ceased
and Claimant was obliged to declare force majeure, thus depriving Claimant of its
use, enjoyement and value of its investment” (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para.
137).

According to Claimant, even if the acts and omissions of Respondent and its
organs constituted a lawful rather than an illegal expropriation, then Claimant
would still be entitled under Article 5 of the BIT to “prompt, adequate and
effective compensation”, amounting to the “genuine value of the investment
expropriated.” Yet, Respondent has not paid any compensation, let alone prompt
adequate and effective compensation amounting to the genuine value of its
investment., and has thus breached Article 5 of the BIT (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, para. 1278).

2.2.1.2 Respondent's Position

According to Respondent, there is no dispute between the Parties regarding the
circumstances in which an expropriation will be deemed lawful under the BIT,
nor is there any dispute that an expropriation may be direct, indirect, or creeping.
Respondent however underlines that the determination of whether an
expropriation has occurred, must be made with reference to specific facts of the
case (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 866).

Respondent contests that an expropriation did take place in the case at hand for
the following key reasons (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 866 fol.):

(i) In order to constitute an indirect expropriation, the measures taken by
the State must effectively destroy the economic benefit of the
investment, resulting in the “neutralization, radical deprivation,
irretrievable loss, inability to use, enjoy or dispose of the property.”
(National Grid v. Argentina (RL-271); Electrabel v. Hungary (RL-
234); Archer Daniels Midland v. Mexico (RL-207); LG&E Energy v.
Argentina (RL-257)). In contrast, measures which simply render the
investment less profitable do not amount to an expropriation of that
investment (Burlington v. Ecuador (RL-219); Paushok v. Mongolia
(RL-277));

(ii) A finding of expropriation futher requires that the substantial
deprivation, in fact, was caused by acts attributable to the State, rather
than by the investor’s own actions or by economic conditions outside
the control of either party (Tecmed v. Mexico (RL-40); Link-Trading
v. Moldova (RL-259); Jan Oostergetel v. Slovak Republic (RL-249)).

These conditions are not met in the present case because (i) Respondent’s actions
did not destroy the economic benefit of Claimant’s investment, or otherwise
substantially interfered with that investment; rather, (ii) Claimant itself caused
AGF to go bankrupt through its own unlawful misrepresentations, self-dealing,
fraud, theft, mismanagement, and inability to implement the Project as promised.
Respondent’s actions were fully justified in taking corrective measures to address
the harm that Claimant and AGF caused through their repeated failures and
serious violations of the law. In addition, none of these corrective measures
caused AGF to go bankrupt, or “placed Claimant in a state of incapacity to carry
out its investment and fulfil its obligations to the joint venture.”

As concerns the specific actions subject to Claimant’s claims, Respondent’s
position is in summary as follows (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 869 fol.,

283

paras. 884 fol.; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 60-114; Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, paras. 11-47):

(i)

(ii)

(iv)

(v)

Respondent’s refusal to register the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement
and the conclusion of the Special Dividend Agreement were justified
and consistent with Uzbek Law, in particular Decree No. 988 (see
above para. 411). Indeed, under Uzbek law, the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations, Investment and Trade could not register AGF’s
Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement to export gold at below-market
prices. Thus, the problem was not that much the hedging itself, but
rather the price of the contract, which did not conform with the market
price as of the date of the contract’s signing in January 2004 or the
date when the Agreement was submitted for registration in March
2004;

The Special Dividend Agreement cannot be constitutive of an
expropriation, as Claimant only paid USD 1 million thereunder as the
MinFin agreed to postpone, offset and accept substitute payment for
Claimant’s remaining obligations thereunder;

The Complex Audit 2006 was carried out in accordance with the law
and, in any event, the Uzbek courts overturned the vast majority of the
financial penalties resulting from the Complex Audit 2006. In this
regard, it should also be noted that the Complex Audit 2006 did not
prevent AGF to continue its operations and to pay out substantial
dividends to Claimant in 2007. As such, the imposition of such
penalties cannot form a basis for Treaty violations;

As concerns the various tax privileges revoked in 2006, Respondent
contends that they were lawfully revoked to the extent that they were
conditioned on AGF’s proper implementation of the Project and on its
compliance with Uzbek law, which were carefully monitored by the
CabMin and by other Uzbek entities. To the extent that AGF failed to
live by its commitments and to fulfil the legal requirements, it had no
right to continue benefiting from these privileges. In addition, the
revocation of such privileges in 2006 did not materially affect AGF’s
operations, since the Uzbek Government agreed to defer AGF’s
additional tax obligations, which were in any event minimal.

284

(vi)

(vii)

The rejection of Claimant’s proposal to refine AGF’s silver doré
outside Uzbekistan could not have substantially deprived Claimant of
its investment in AGF, because Claimant and AGF had agreed at the
outset of the Project that AGF would refine all silver doré in the
Republic of Uzbekistan. In this regard, Article 4 of Decree No. 477
does not grant AGF the right to export semi-finished products, such as
doré, offshore, but only the finished silver and gold products. In
addition, the problems arising out of the refining of the silve doré bars
were primarily due to the inadequate levels of impurities contained in
the doré bars delivered by AGF, and not a lack of competence on
behalf of AGMK. As concerns the purchase of a refinery, the AGF
shareholders agreed during the General Shareholders Meeting of 29
September 2008 (see above para. 518) to postpone consideration of
Claimant’s proposal until AGF’s financial situation had stabilized,
which it never did;

The 2009 and 2011 VAT changes, moreover, did not violate AGF’s
stabilization clause, as that guarantee had been lawfully revoked in
2006 by Resolutions Nos. 74 and 133. In any event, by the time the
Government amended its VAT regime in 2009 and 2011, and
conducted the Audit 2011, Claimant already had voluntarily shut
down AGF’s CIP plant, as planned and for unrelated reasons. Thus,
the 2011 VAT change had no impact on AGF’s operations. As
concerns the 2009 VAT changes they could not be expropriatory,
because they did not target any particular company and were
introduced in response to the global economic crisis;

(viii) The Audit 2011 was conducted in full compliance with the law and

authorized by the National Council for Coordination of Supervisory
Activities. Unscheduled audits are permitted under Law No. 717-I in
certain circumstances, and in the present case it was conducted upon
request of the Ministry of Finance pursuant to Order No. 015 dated 16
February 2011 (see above para. 652, Exh. R-663/C-402) and Order
No. 06-4157 of 22 March 2011 of the National Council for
Coordination of Supervisory Activities (no exhibit on file). In
addition, this Audit 2011 never prevented Claimant from pursuing its
activities in AGF, and instead confirmed that AGF had committed
multiple violations of Uzbek law, thereby obstructing AGF’s ability to
operate normally. Claimant itself abandoned AGF in the middle of the
Audit 2011 on false pretenses after stealing over USD 2 million in
foreign currency revenue from AGF’s bank accounts (Exh. R-583_5).
Further, Claimant maintained control over AGF’s offshore bank
account at Barclays Bank, which was never frozen and which
Claimant operated in violation of Uzbek law on foreign currency;

285

(xi) Notwithstanding the fact that certain licenses were not renewed, for
reasons attributable to Claimant, the Uzbek Government nevertheless
permitted Claimant to operate while its application for renewal of
licenses were pending:

726. As concerns the different licences, the Respondent states the following:

- As concerns the Cyanide License (see above para. 472, 629, 635),
Claimant requested its renewal only after it had expired (Resp.
PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 95).

- As concerns the Renewed Exploration License (see above paras.
533 and 588), it was denied because Claimant had failed to carry
out exploration works under its previous exploration license and
had failed to substantiate the necessity of prolonging its exploration
works (see in particular Bayzitova WS, para. 7).

- As concerns the Mining License (see above paras. 415, 476, 498,
499-503), the renewal of such license was never approved by the
Deputy Chairman or the Chairman of the Committee of the
CabMin, but this did not prevent Sanoat from allowing AGF to
continue its mining operations while the license renewal
application was pending despite the fact that AGF repeatedly
violated the terms of the Mining License (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014,
paras. 90 fol.).

-  Asconcerns the Sarybatyr Licence (see above paras. 548, 585, 587,
634), Claimant did not apply for the license until 2009 and did not
submit a complete application until 24 September 2010, by which
time the Uzbek Parties had already called for a voluntary
liquidation of AGF (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 92 fol.). In
addition, Claimant did not have a secured right to develop
Sarybatyr (Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 30).

As such, Claimant’s investment in AGF suffered no harm from any issues
relating to licensing. In particular, unlike in Metalclad v. Mexico or Tecmed
v. Mexico, Claimant was not deprived of the economic or commercial value
associated with its operations and activities in AGF as a result of any
licensing issues.

727. As concerns Phase 2, Claimant’s failure to obtain financing for Phase 2 through
CITIC is attributable only to Claimant and not to any acts or omissions of

286

Respondent for the following reasons (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 880 fol.;
Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 115 fol.):

0)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

(vii)

Respondent contends that Claimant never presented an economically
acceptable Feasibility Study in line with the requirements set forth under
Decree No. 110, and thus never obtained any rights to develop Phase 2
(Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 866 in fine; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014,
para. 116). As to Claimant’s arguments regarding its alleged “catch-22”
position, they are unfounded, as evidenced by the testimony of Mr. Pringle
and Mr. Tyler, who both confirmed that financing could be secured on a
conditional basis and that the prior obtention of the licenses were therefore
not indispensable (Transcript of 2 May 2014, 1240:18 — 1241:10 and
Transcript of 30 April 2014, 709:17-21).

Respondent was justified in rejecting Claimant’s Phase 2 proposal,
because Claimant offered an unacceptably high interest rate and
administrative fee for the first proposed loan tranche, provided no
assurance that the second loan tranche would be concluded on reasonable
terms, and demanded certain privileges which did not accord with Uzbek
law.

Claimant itself endangered the financing of Phase 2 by its fraudulent and
self-serving financial transactions, including the payment of a USD 65.7
million dividend in 2007 (see above para. 555).

CITIC based its proposed financing on a smaller scale project than that
which Claimant submitted to the Government in February 2009 (see above
para. 571) and thus Claimant would in any case have needed to submit a
new Feasibility Study and obtain approval thereof (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 880 fol.; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 126).

Claimant failed to establish any link between Goskomgeology’s and
NMMC’s requests for voluntary liquidation of AGF and CITIC’s decision
not to finance Phase 2. Rather, one of AGF’s suppliers initiated
bankruptcy proceedings against AGF, which still are ongoing in
accordance with Uzbek law.

The abolishment of the VAT exemption for precious metals sales,
effective as of 1 January 2011, did not target AGF or cause the collapse of
the CITIC financing.

The initiation of litigation against Claimant for payment of the amount
owed under the Special Dividend Agreement could equally not have

287

caused the collapse of the CITIC financing, all the more that the Ministry
of Finance agreed to postpone, offset, and accept substitute payment for
Claimant’s obligations under the Special Dividend Agreement. Thus,
Claimant has not proffered any evidence that this litigation led to the
collapse of the CITIC financing, or resulted in the neutralization, radical
deprivation, or irretrievable loss of Claimant’s investment in AGF.

728. As concerns the Atlas Copco drill rig, Claimant appears to have withdrawn its
allegation that its drill rig is being considered as part of AGF’s assets and that it is
being sold by AGF’s liquidation manager. AGF’s liquidation manager has
repeatedly explained that AGF has to bear the expense of re-exporting the drill
rig, but is not in a financial situation to pay such expenses. That AGF’s liquidation
manager is unable to fulfil a contractual obligation between AGF and Claimant
has no bearing on Claimant’s claim for breaches of the State’s international
obligations under the BIT (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 114).

729. With regard to Claimant’s alternative claim of “creeping expropriation”,
Respondent contends that all of Respondent’s actions were lawful and justified,
and further did not divest Claimant of any legal rights or otherwise deprive
Claimant of the management, use, control, or value of its investment in AGF
(Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 884 fol.).

2.2.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

2.2.2.1 The Applicable Legal Basis (Reminder) and Standards

730. Article 5 of the BIT provides as follows (Exh. CL-20):

“ARTICLE 5
Expropriation

(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall
not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect
equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to
as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other Contracting Party
except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party
on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and
effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the genuine
value of the investment expropriated immediately before the
expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public
knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal
commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay,
be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The national or
company affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting

288

731.

732.

733.

734.

Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other
independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the
valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set
out in this paragraph.

(2

Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which
is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its
own territory, and in which nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of
paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to
guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of
their investment to such nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.”

As mentioned previously (see above para. 297), Article 5(1) provides that the
State is entitled to proceed with the expropriation of an investment under five
cumulative conditions: (i) expropriation, or any measure having equivalent effect,
must be justified by a public purpose; (ii) it must be effected on a non-
discriminatory basis; (iii) it must be accompanied by adequate compensation to be
calculated based on the “value of the investment expropriated immediately before
the expropriation”, including interest; (iv) be effected “without delay”; and (v) the
expropriation or the valuation of the compensation shall be subject to review by a
judicial or other independent authority

The situation of an expropriation of “assets” of a company which is constituted
under the law of Uzbekistan, i.e. AGF, is expressly contemplated in para. 2 of
Article 5, which further provides that the foreign shareholder of such company,
i.e. Claimant, shall be entitled to the same treatment as described in para. 1 as
concerns the expropriation of its investment in such company.

There is no dispute between the Parties that an expropriation under Article 5 of
the BIT can take two main forms, i.e. a direct expropriation or an indirect
expropriation, including a so-called ‘creeping’ expropriation.

Respondent further seems to largely agree with Claimant’s presentation of the
theoretical standards to apply in order to determine the existence of a direct or
indirect expropriation (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 866; Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 377 referring to Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 478):

(i) Referring to Newcombe/Paradell,”” Claimant defines ‘direct
expropriation’ as the straightforward taking of an investment by the State

which “involves the investor being deprived of property and a

*7 4. Newcombe and L. Paradell, Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of
Treatment, Kluwer Law International 2009, p. 340.

289

(ii)

corresponding appropriation by the state, or state-mandated beneficiary,
of specific property rights.” (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, para. 479).

1,28

Referring still to Newcombe/Paradell,” Claimant defines then indirect

expropriation and “creeping expropriation”:

- “indirect expropriation may occur when measures result in the
effective loss of management, use or control, or a significant
depreciation of value, of the assets of a foreign investor”
(Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania, para. 327).

- creeping expropriation is thus “an indirect expropriation that
occurs as a result of a series of measures taken over time that
cumulatively have an expropriatory effect, rather than a single
measure or group of measures that occur at one time.” In this
regard, citing also Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, Claimant
relies on the following statements of this tribunal (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, paras. 480 and 481): creeping expropriation is “a
form of indirect expropriation with a distinctive temporal quality
in the sense that it encapsulates the situation whereby a series of
acts attributable to the State over a period of time culminate in
the expropriatory taking of such property.” (Generation Ukraine
v. Ukraine, para. 20.22). Claimant further relies on similar
statements of tribunals in Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania, Rumeli
v. Kazakhstan, and others.

735. Respondent however stresses two main points:

0)

that “it also is well established that, in order to constitute an indirect
expropriation, measures taken by the State must interfere with property
rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they
must be deemed to have been expropriated.” (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 278 relying on Starrett Housing v. Iran, p. 154 (RL-
299)) so that the “measures thus must effectively destroy the economic
benefit of the investment, resulting in the neutralization, radical
deprivation, irretrievable loss, inability to use, enjoy or dispose of the
property.” (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 377 relying on National
Grid v. Argentina, para. 149 (RL-271) and Electrabel v. Hungary, para.
6.62 (RL-34)), and

TAL.

(ii) that there can be no expropriation unless acts attributable to the State are
responsible for extinguishing “the investment’s continuing capacity to
generate a return.” (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 378 fol. Relying
among others on Burlington v. Ecuador, para. 399 (RL-219.

The Parties further disagree on whether these standards are met under the
circumstances of the case at hand.

The key question at stake is thus whether any of the actions and omissions of
Respondent about which Claimant complains, taken separately or as a whole, may
be constitutive of an expropriation in the sense of Article 5 of the BIT, either in
the form of a direct expropriation or through “measures having equivalent effect”,
i.e. an indirect or a “creeping” expropriation.

2.2.2.2 The Relevancy of Article 5 and Relevant Legal Standards in the Present
Case

As concerns a direct expropriation, Claimant does not allege that Respondent has
appropriated its 50% shareholding in AGF. Indeed, although AGF was put in
liquidation, there is no allegation that the Uzbek State has taken away the legal
rights of Claimant in AGF. The allegations made by Claimant rather aim at
arguing that, through its actions and omissions, Respondent has de facto deprived
Claimant of the control, use and enjoyment of its investment and has annihilated
the value of such investment. As such, the relevant legal standard to apply in the
present case is the standard of indirect expropriation.

The Arbitral Tribunal largely agrees with the various cases cited by the Parties
and considers that an indirect expropriation, in particular in the form of a creeping
expropriation, exists under the following circumstances:

Contrary to what happens with a direct expropriation, where the goal of the legal
act performing the expropriation is precisely to take a property, in case of indirect
expropriation, there is a State law or regulation, or sometimes some behaviour, —
the purpose of which was not to take the property but the effect was just that.
Such indirect expropriation can result from a single act or a series of acts. In this
latter case, it is considered as a creeping expropriation, which is a process
extending in time and comprising a succession of measures that, taken separately,
do not have the effect of dispossessing the investor but when taken together do
lead to such a result.

As a matter of principle, general regulations, even if having negative effect on an
investor’s property, are not to be considered as expropriatory.

291

742. Several arbitral tribunals have restated this fundamental principle. For example, in
Feldman v. Mexico, the ICSID arbitral tribunal said that:

“Governments must be free to act in the broader public interest through
protection of the environment, new or modified tax regimes, the granting or
withdrawal of government subsidies, reductions or increases in tariff levels,

if of zoning restrictions and the like. R bl l
regulation of this type cannot be achieved if any business that is adversely
affected may seek compensation, and it is safe to say that customary
international law recognizes this.

[...] not all government regulatory activity that makes it difficult or
impossible for an investor to carry out a particular business, change in the
law or change in the application of existing laws that makes it uneconomical
to continue a particular business, is an expropriation ... Governments, in
their exercise of regulatory power, frequently change their laws and
regulations in response to changing economic circumstances or changing
political, economic or social considerations ... those changes may well make
their activities less profitable or even uneconomic to continue.” (Feldman,
paras. 103 and 112; emphasis added)

743. The clearest and strongest assertion of the principle can be found in the Saluka v.
Czech Republic award, an UNCITRAL investment arbitration under a BIT:

“Tt is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay
compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their
regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide
regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.”(Saluka v. Czech
Republic, para. 255).

744. This general principle has, of course, exceptions and a general regulation can be
expropriatory if it is unreasonable or if it violates specific commitments given by
the State to the investor. This has been aptly summarized by the tribunal in the
Methanex case:

“In the Tribunal’s view, Methanex is correct that an_ intentionally
discriminatory regulation against a foreign investor fulfils a key requirement
for establishing expropriation. But as a matter of general international law,
a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in
accordance with due process and, which affects, inter alias, a foreign
investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless
specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the
then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government
would refrain from such regulation.” (Methanex, para. 7 of Part IV - Chapter
D; emphasis added).

 

292

745.

746.

747.

748.

749.

As far as the effect of such regulation — unreasonable or in contradiction with
specific commitments — is concerned, it must be equivalent to the effect of a
direct expropriation in order to be qualified as expropriatory. The Tribunal
agrees with the summary presented by the E/ Paso v. Argentina tribunal
concerning the effect necessary for an act to be considered expropriatory:

“The Tribunal considers that at least one of the essential components of the
property rights must have disappeared for an expropriation to have
occurred. It emphasises that the overwhelming majority of investment
arbitration cases stand for the proposition that an expropriation usually
implies a “removal of the ability of an owner to make use of its economic
rights.” ("renee med] Ty is’ generally accepted that the decisive element in an
indirect expropriation is the “loss of control” of a foreign investment, in the
absence of any physical taking. ” (El Paso v. Argentina, para. 245).

Claimant’s claim for expropriation is based on a two-fold approach, consisting in
claiming first that specific events, such as the Audit 2011 or the actions taken by
the State in 2006, are of a nature to constitute in themselves an indirect
expropriation. Alternatively, Claimant argues that all the actions and omissions of
Respondent taken together would in any event amount to a creeping expropriation
of Claimant’s investment.

Thus, in principle, the Arbitral Tribunal would need to first examine the specific
events alleged to constitute a separate act of expropriation, and, if the Arbitral
Tribunal finds that this is not the case, it would need to look at all the actions and
omissions of the State taken together to appreciate whether such combination
could amount to a creeping expropriation.

In the present case, however, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider it necessary
to enter into such step by step analysis because it is of the opinion that Claimant
has generally failed to establish two key components of an indirect expropriation:
(i) the effective destruction of the value of the investment; and/or (ii) the causality
link between the loss of such value and an act attributable to the State.

None of the events prior to 2007 reach, either separately or collectively, the
threshold of depriving Claimant of its investment. The fact that the State actions
taken in 2006, including the Complex Audit 2006 and the change in the VAT
regime, may have had adverse effects on AGF’s operations and profit is per se not
sufficient to constitute an “expropriation”. This is clearly evidenced by the fact
that Claimant paid out in 2007 a dividend of US$ 65.7 million to its shareholders
as a result of its operations in Uzbekistan (see above para. 555).

293

750. Equally, none of the events which occurred between 2007 and late 2010 reach that

751.

threshold either. This is largely evidenced by Mr. Wilkins letter of 10 December
2010 (Exh. C-18), in which he tried to convince the Uzbek Parties not to liquidate
the Joint Venture and expressed the opinion that “AGF is ahead of target for 2010
and is operating profitably”, it “can continue to operate profitably provided the
appropriate licenses are issued and AGF’s tax regime can be stabilised” and that
Oxus “wishes to invest significant amounts of additional capital, and to clear its
debt to the Ministry of Finance.” In this letter, Mr. Wilkins then further offered on
behalf of Oxus to purchase the Uzbek Parties’ shares or to sell Oxus’ shares to the
Uzbek Parties at “50% of the value of AGF’s existing balance sheet” plus a
production royalty. These statements do not accord with Claimant’s position that
it had by then already been expropriated of the value of its investment. If that had
been the case, Claimant would not have approached the liquidation of AGF in the
way it did in Mr. Wilkins’ letter.

The remaining question is thus whether the events which occurred from late 2010
to 2012, including in particular the failure of the financing, the Audit 2011, the
criminal investigations and the liquidation proceedings could be seen as the
culmination of a series of events imputable to the State which eventually caused
the total loss of value of AGF. The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider this to be
the case for the following reasons:

- As of 2009, Claimant had already stopped the gold processing
operations and the Uzbek Parties had been requesting liquidation
for some time, not least because of the operational problems and
the little amount of dividends that had been distributed by then.
Indeed, financial problems were not new and while Claimant
continued to make money through the AGF Management and
Services Agreement and the AGF General Administration
Agreement, as well as kept control over large amounts of foreign
currencies through the Barclays account, the Uzbek Parties were
not seeing the money they had legitimately been expecting under
the Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility Study and had reasons to be
unsatisfied.

- Claimant’s claim of creeping expropriation is also largely based
on the contention that it is the actions of the Uzbek State which
led to the failure of the financing, first by RBS and then by
CITIC. However, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that there
was such a direct link with RBS’s or CITIC’s decision not to
provide the financing. As concerns RBS’s decision, it was
discussed internally among the management of Claimant and
AGF and, whilst Claimant disagreed with the reasons given by
RBS, there was no direct link with State’s actions in Uzbekistan

294

752.

753.

at that time (see above paras. 562-566). As concerns CITIC, it is
very likely that the tensions between Claimant and the State may
have influenced CITIC’s decision not to provide the financing.
However, this tension was the result of a complex factual matrix,
in which Claimant and AGF bore part of the responsibility. As
such, CITIC’s decision not to provide the financing cannot be
deemed to be the mere result of Respondent’s refusal to issue
certain licenses or to otherwise support AGF in terms of tax
treatment.

- By 2011, operations at AGF had almost completely ceased. As
such, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the Audit 2011,
the criminal investigations and the liquidation proceedings were
more a reaction to an already catastrophic situation, rather than
the cause of such situation. Indeed, by the end of 2010, the
financial and operational difficulties encountered by AGF were
significant, including the failure to find financing for Phase 2. It
is thus not surprising that these difficulties triggered certain
reactions from the Uzbek Parties and the State. Whether or not
such reactions were in line with some of the State’s obligations
under the BIT is a separate question.

In summary, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the loss of control over and the loss
of the value of Claimant’s investment did not occur before 2011 and that, at that
stage, a considerable number of diverse problems had affected AGF’s operations.
Indeed, as arises out of the underlying facts and evidence, the degradation of
Claimant’s investment was the result of a process of several years during which
Respondent took certain actions directed at AGF and/or Oxus, whereby one
cannot say that the degradation of Claimant’s investment is the direct result of
Respondent’s actions. In fact, AGF suffered from internal management problems
and incurred substantial operational delays for which AGF, and thereby Claimant,
bear part of the responsibility, such as (1) AGF’s delivery of doré bars with
inadequate levels of impurities which subsequently gave rise to issues in refining
the silver doré bars, (2) the fact that AGF was not fully compliant with all tax,
foreign currency and customs law, in particular with regard to the way AGF
managed foreign currency through its Barclays Bank account and (3) in relation to
the Cyanide License, Claimant’s failure to carry out exploration works under its
first exploration license which resulted in the refusal for a renewed Exploration
License.

As such, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimant has failed to establish the
necessary causal link between the incriminated actions of Respondent and
Claimant’s alleged deprivation of its investment, and that its claims for direct or
indirect or creeping expropriation therefore fail.

295

754.

755.

756.

757.

Lastly, Claimant also claims that it was expropriated of the Atlas Copco drill rig
(see above para. 133, Claims No. 1583.9). The Arbitral Tribunal finds that
Claimant’s claim in this respect is unfounded for the following reasons:

Claimant argues that in 2010 it purchased an Atlas Copco Diamec U-6 drill rig for
the amount of USD 2,562,599 which was made available for use by AGF for
purposes of improved exploration and that it has been unable to obtain the return
of this drill rig or at least formal assurances that it may collect the drill rig
withoutt being improperly or unlawfully hindered (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
para. 1339). It then argues that by including the sale of the "Atlas Copco Diamec
U-699 drill rig" in the agenda of the meeting for the liquidation of AGF (C-6999),
Mr Kazakov and subsequently Respondent have "de facto expropriated the rig"
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras 1340-1341).

In contrast, Respondent argues that there is a confusion on the part of Claimant
concerning the designation of the drill rig and that there were in fact two drill rigs
in operation for AGF, one being the Atlas Copco Diamec U-6 drill rig which
belonged to AGF and was sold at auction in the liquidation process and an Atlas
Copco Explorac 220 RC drill rig which was bought by Claimant for use by AGF.

According to one of the liquidator’s letter of 16 October 2013 to counsel for
Claimant, that drill rig was kept in AGF’s customs warehouse for storage and
Claimant was entitled to re-export it upon compliance with the Respondent’s
customs laws (Res. Am. Rej., para. 806 fol.). Concerning the nature of the drill rig
at issue, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Claimant has based its claim on a
wrong designation of that drill rig. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that, in its
Amended Reply, Claimant refers to letters by Mr. Shead and by its counsel but
neither these documents makes a specific description of that rig (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1339.1342). On the other hand, Respondent has
produced a Witness Statement from Mr. Kasakov and an abstract from Mr.
Wilkins’ diary entry dated 27 January 2011 which mentions Claimant’s Explora
220RC drill rig (WS-Kazakov, para. 12-13 ; R-689_410). The Arbitral Tribunal
has seen no evidence to the contrary from Claimant and Claimant did not call Mr.
Kazakov for cross-examination. In any event, whatever is the right designation of
that rig, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimant has not succeeded in
demonstrating that there had been a de facto expropriation of its rig. In its letter of
16 October 2013 to counsel for Claimant, Mr. Kazakov pointed out specifically
that, in AGF’s view (Exh. R-957), Claimant was legally entitled to re-export its
equipment from the territory of Respondent and described in detail the procedure
to be followed for equipment re-export. None of the conditions). None of the
conditions mentioned by Mr. Kazakov appear to the Arbitral Tribunal to be
abnormal circumstances. Moreover, in his letter, Mr. Kazakov gives a reasonable
explanation as to why Claimant’s first approach by a representative of a shipping
company retained by Claimant could not be accommodated and Claimant has

296

2.2.3

758.

759.

2.3.1

760.

761.

provided no evidence to the effect that it subsequently attempted to meet these
conditions. Claimant’s claim for compensation relating to the drill rig is therefore
rejected.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Claimant’s claims for expropriation under Article 5 of the BIT, in
particular Claimant’s AGF Claims No. | to 7 are rejected, as well as Claim No. 10
to the extent it is based on an alleged expropriation.

This finding is without prejudice as to whether the factual basis underlying
Claimant’s claims for expropriation may be constitutive of a breach of standards
applicable under Article 2 of the BIT, which is examined in the next section.

2.3 Issue No. 3: Do Respondent’s Actions and Omissions Amount to Any
Other Violation of the BIT?

With Regard to the FET Standard, Including the Prohibition of
Arbitrary, Unreasonable or Discriminatory Treatment

2.3.1.1 The Parties’ Positions
(a) Claimant’s Position

According to Claimant, Respondent’s actions and omissions during the 2004-2011
period as well as the liquidation proceedings were not consistent with Claimant’s
legitimate expectations, were not transparent, and were in breach of the State’s
good faith obligations, and/or were arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic,
discriminatory or lacking due process (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1281
fol.). As such, these actions breached the FET standard under Article 2 of the BIT
as well as the “standard of reasonableness” thereunder, which Claimant contends
“does not have a different meaning from the [FET standard]” and also includes
the standard of protection against arbitrariness (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
para. 1308).

As concerns the specific events, Claimant argues mainly as follows:

297

762. Changes in the tax regime: Claimant’s claim of breach of Article 2 of the BIT in
relation to the changes in the Uzbek tax regime has three sub-sets: (i) the
revocation of tax privileges under Decrees No. 477, No. 127-20 and No. 266 and
of the stabilization clauses in 2006, (ii) the VAT regime modifications in 2009,
and (iii) the changes to the VAT regime in 2010 (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
paras. 1281 fol.). The impact on Claimant of these three separate changes to the
tax regime applicable to AGF are threefold: (i) they resulted in monetary losses to
AGF by causing the JV to pay significantly higher taxes; (ii) they impaired the
cash flow of the JV by forcing it to divert funds that would otherwise have been
used to pay the costs of running the business or meet liabilities, and (iii) they
adversely impacted the perception of AGF as a safe investment, Oxus as a secure
investor in Uzbekistan and Uzbekistan as a safe host State for investment.

(i) Revocation of tax privileges and changes in July 2006: The tax law
changes, in particular via Decrees No. 74 and 133 in May and July 2006
respectively (see above paras. 478 and 479), had as effect that AGF was
no more exempt from payment of income taxes, customs duties and
property tax, payment allocations, payments for depreciation of fixed
assets and taxes on dividends and payments under credits chargeable when
transferring money abroad. Thus, it made AGF liable to pay significantly
more taxes than it had bargained for when it made its investment into
AGF. These changes were clearly in breach of the stabilization clause
which had a ten-year validity (i.e. until 1 July 2010) and the specific tax
privileges granted to Claimant were defined as being valid for the life of
the Project. Therefore, Respondent’s arguments as to needing to limit
these privileges in time or as being justified because of alleged
“underperformance” by AGF are unfounded. Whereas a State may modify
its tax regime, Claimant contends that the State must honor stabilization
clauses and the specific privileges that it grants to the investor. Absent a
stabilization clause, the State’s power is “not without limits, which
includes the principles of proportionality and rationality” (Tza Yap Sum v.
Peru, (CL-171)). Also, no taxation can be discriminatory (Burlington v.
Ecuador, RL-219) (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 21 fol.; Claim. PHB
Il. 21.08.2014, paras. 107 fol.). Claimant’s expert, Mr. Haberman,
estimates the monetary impact of such change as causing losses to
Claimant of USD 14,1 million as at 30 June 2012, and USD 13,3 million
as at 18 March 2011 (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 44; Haberman II,
para. 6.5). In addition, Claimant’s claim an amount of USD 2,7 million for
the withholding of AGF’s input VAT.

(ii) Changes in VAT regime in 2009: On 1 January 2009, the VAT treatment
of the production, sale and export of precious metals was changed from
“zero-rated” to “exempt” (see above para. 595). Through this change, AGF
was no longer entitled to have the VAT reimbursed that it paid on goods

298

(iii)

and services it purchased in Uzbekistan, or on imports into Uzbekistan. No
warning or advance notice was provided to Claimant at the time, in
particular no mention was made by Respondent about the need to swap the
VAT treatment of gold v. cotton, as now alleged by Respondent.
Respondent has failed to prove that these changes were needed to further
the Government’s aim of supporting and stimulating the Uzbek cotton
industry. This VAT change, beyond the adverse financial impact it had,
conveyed in this context the wrong message to lenders that the country
and/or the Project was at risk, particularly in light of the previous acts and
omissions of Respondent. Thus, it is telling that it is precisely after the
entering into force of this VAT change that RBS and Nedbank withdrew
their interests (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1010 fol.). In
addition, de facto, AGF was the only company adversely affected by this
change, which was thus ‘discriminatory’, and in any event unfair and
unreasonable (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1029 fol.; paras. 1317
fol.; Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 28 fol.; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014,
paras. 109 fol.). Claimant’s expert, Mr. Haberman, estimates the monetary
impact of such change as causing losses to Claimant of USD 39 million as
at 30 June 2012, and USD 35,5 million as at 18 March 2011; as to the
cumulative adverse impact of this tax change (including also the 2006 tax
changes) on AGF’s cash flow for the period 2007 to 2011, it amounted to
USD 25,5 million (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 71; Haberman II,
paras. 6.5 and 6.6).

 

Changes in VAT regime in 2011: On | January 2011, the VAT treatment
of the production, sale and export of precious metals was changed from
“exempt” to “standard rated”, i.e. at 20% (see above para. 641). These
changes, which became effective upon the expiry of the stabilization
clause, were unfair and inequitable, as well as discriminatory to the extent
that they de facto impacted Claimant only. The adverse financial impact of
this change on Claimant’s cash flow has been quantified by Mr. Haberman
in the amounts of USD 66,8 million if calculated as of 30 June 2012, or
USD 45,7 million if calculated as of 18 March 2011 (Haberman II, para.
6.5). These changes put even further beyond doubt for any bank or
financing company, that the political risk associated with Uzbekistan was
far too high to consider providing a loan for the AGF Project. No
explanations, let alone legitimate explanations, were given for these
changes (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1139 fol.; paras. 1317 fol.;
Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 31 fol.; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para.
112). Claimant’s expert, Mr. Haberman, estimates the monetary impact of
such change as causing losses to Claimant of USD 51,1 million as at 30
June 2012, and USD 32,5 million as at 18 March 2011 (Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 77; Annex 2 to Claimant’s letter of 6 June 2014, p. 3,
para. 6.5). Mr. Haberman further calculates the cash flow impact of this

299

regulatory change on AGF as amounting to USD 11,1 million for 2011
alone (Haberman II, para. 6.6)

763. Alleged undue refusal to issue and/or renew licenses: This claim concerns in

 

particular four licenses, i.e. (i) the general Mining License, which expired in 2006
(see above para. 499), (ii) the license for Sarybatyr (see above paras. 548 and
585), (iii) the Cyanide License (see above paras. 472 and 629) and (iv) the
Renewed Exploration License (see above paras. 533 and 588). According to
Claimant, AGF had an exclusive right to explore, develop and mine the
Amantaytau Goldfields for 30 years, as per Decree No. 477, and these licenses
were required for operations, and thus for the very use, enjoyment and value of
such investment (see Metalclad v. Mexico, CL-93) and they were material to
securing the required financing. The procedure for the renewal and/or issuance of
licenses was not in accordance with the procedure set out in Decree No. 112, not
transparent nor one that an investor would legitimately expect; nor was the
procedure handled in good faith (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1290 fol.;
Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 85 fol.; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 103
fol.). As concerns the Mining License, Claimant rejects Respondent’s, and in
particular Mr. Maysupov’s explanations (see Transcripts of 2 May 2014 1061:11 -
1063:4) for the absence of approval of the Mining License, namely AGF’s failure
to meet its annual targets and the alleged violation of Uzbek law. These
explanations are contradicted by contemporaneous evidence in particular by the
expert conclusions prepared by Sanoat in December 2005 and May 2008, which
confirmed that the conditions for license renewal were met (Exhs. C-635 and 636,
see above paras. 473 and 541) (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 100 fol.). As
concerns the Sarybatyr License, Claimant contends that the Sarybatyr gold deposit
had proven to contain profitable gold reserves, which could have stabilized the
unfavourable financial situation of AGF in 2009. However, Claimant never
received a formal approval nor was duly informed of the status of this application.
According to Claimant, therefore, the failure to grant the required licenses is in
breach of Article 2.2 of the BIT, as well as of Claimant’s legitimate expectations
(See Metalclad v. Mexico, paras. 93, 97, 100, CL-93 ; Tecmed v. Mexico, paras.
165-166, CL-80) (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 107 fol.). This led to
Claimant’s deprivation of the opportunity to mine the Sarybatyr deposit,
quantified by Mr. Haberman as causing a loss in the range of USD 27,6 million to
USD 31,7 million (Haberman II, para. 6.5).

300

764. Allegedly unfair prevention to export gold and the unfair and inequitable
imposing of the Guarantee Letters and Special Dividend Agreement:
Respondent’s demand that Claimant compensate it under the Guarantee Letters
and Special Dividend Agreement for the use of hedging, which were unfair and
inequitable. In particular, the entering into the Guarantee Letters and the Special
Dividend Agreement was done under coercion and duress and was arbitrary,
inflicted as a result of the ban on the export of gold until signature by Claimant of
the Guarantee Letters. The use of hedging in the Financing Agreement had been
approved by all of AGF’s shareholders and registered with the Central Bank, and
such hedging was “legitimate, lawful and fully-authorized” (Claim. PHB II.
21.08.2014, para. 99). Claimant had an “unconditional right to export gold as
guaranteed in various legal instruments”, including Article 4 of Decree No. 477
and AFER’s letter of 20 February 2004 (see above para. 444). However,
notwithstanding the fact that hedging was common practice and also lawful and
authorized, the Ministry of Finance nonetheless blocked the export of AGF’s
gold. This blocking was illegal and in turn led AGF to default on its first two gold
shipments due on 27 February and 31 March 2004 under the HGOA, to suffer
severe cash flow problems, and breach its obligations under the Financing
Agreement. This liability imposed by Respondent on Claimant was also
discriminatory, as it specifically targeted Claimant, as opposed to AGF and/or the
other State shareholders. Further, by refusing to accept or even consider any of the
numerous good faith alternative proposals made by Claimant for the payment of
the Special Dividend liability, Respondent acted unreasonably, unfairly, and
inequitably towards Claimant. As concerns the legal proceedings, which were
initiated to enforce the liability under the Special Dividend Agreement upon
Claimant, Claimant was denied justice as it was prevented from presenting its
case (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1294 fol. and 1298 fol.; paras. 1317
fol.; paras. 1322 fol.; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 99).

765. Allegedly unfair Respondent's demand that all silver be refined by AMGK and the
issue with Claimant's refinery: Respondent’s imposition of AMGK to refine silver
as opposed to a foreign competitor that was more qualified and less expensive,
was unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and unreasonable, notably under Article 4 of
Decree No. 477, Article 10 of the Law on Foreign Investment, and Article 2(2) of
the BIT. In addition, imposing AMGK as the sole refiner as opposed to a foreign
competitor that was more qualified and less expensive than AMGK, such as
Metalor, was also discriminatory. Respondent furthermore also unduly refused to
allow AGF to use the silver refinery purchased from Italy. Claimant contends that
AGF’s shareholders had agreed to the purchase of this refinery due to the
problems relating to the refining of silver through AMGK, and that Claimant
thereafter proceeded to the purchase of this refinery. Claimant further contends
that it informed Respondent thereof, in Mr. Wilkins’ letter of 18 December 2008
to Mr. Tursunov, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance, stating as follows:
“[...] I believe it would be helpful to inform you of the following: [...] Approx

301

766.

767.

$15 million in metal value is stockpiled at AMMC and on site at AGF due to the
lack of capacity of AMMC to refine AGF’s silver doré on a timely basis. AGF is
building its own silver refinery, as you know, but this refinery is unlikely to be in
operation before July 2009. It is therefore essential that AGF is granted a permit
to make a once-off shipment of silver doré for refining overseas, in order to turn
this metal into cash.” (Exh, C-540). However, Respondent unduly refused this
once-off shipment, as well as the purchase of a refinery, which had to be
abandoned and after having been left idle until February 2013, was finally sold by
Claimant, although at a significant loss (Exh. C-677) (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, paras. 1335 fol.; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 101).

Allegedly unfair refusal to approve the Feasibility Study for Phase 2: The refusal
of Respondent to approve Claimant’s Feasibility Study was unfair and
inequitable, because the procedure was not transparent as the comments and
criticisms thereto made by Respondent were not communicated in full to
Claimant. Also, Respondent was not acting consistently or fairly by refusing to
approve the study prior to financing whereas this was inconsistent with industry
financing practice and against Claimant’s legitimate expectations, as confirmed by
Goskomgeology’s letter of 20 May 2009 (Exh. R-234), as well as by the process
of feasibility study approval that was followed during Phase 1 (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, paras. 1296, and paras. 929-1009). Respondent’s undue refusal to
approve the Feasibility Study for Phase 2 prevented Claimant from obtaining
financing and caused a loss of USD 127,8 million according to Mr. Haberman’s
calculation (Haberman II, para. 4.24).

The Audits 2006 and 2011 and the thereto associated legal and criminal
proceedings: According to Claimant, these audits and proceedings were arbitrary,
grossly unfair, unjust and idiosyncratic (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras.
1303 fol.).

(i) The first Complex Audit 2006 and its nonsensical finding of a liability of
approximately USD 225 million, was followed by an enforcement action
in the Uzbek court accompanied by the issuing of freezing and collection
orders on AGF’s bank accounts, fixed assets and finished products, the
results of which included AGF’s default on its payment obligations
towards contractors and a severe cash flow problem that jeopardized
operations. This resulted in the sale of 16% of Oxus, at a very low price.
This finding, although ultimately overturned in its near totality, resulted
in damages, and left Oxus, as a listed company with a record of having
an at-risk investment (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1304; Claim.
PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 100);

(ii) The second Audit 2011 was even more arbitrary as it led to the
harassment, threats, intimidation and arrest of AGF’s executives, and

302

ultimately to the declaration of force majeure by Claimant (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1305).

768. The liquidation of AGF: As concerns the liquidation process, Claimant at first
contended that it was deprived of a reasonable opportunity to participate thereto
given the consequences of the Audit 2011 and the fact that Claimant was not
notified of the court procedure (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1306). In its
Post-Hearing Brief, however, Claimant states as follows (Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 148): “Claimant addresses this question regarding the AGF
liquidation procedure out of its desire to respond fully to the Tribunal’s questions.
However, Claimant emphasises that in order to succeed on the merits of its
claims, its case does not depend in any way upon Respondent's pathological
failings in respect of the AGF liquidation procedure”, and further (para. 183) :

“In conclusion, the liquidation proceedings lacked judicial propriety, due
process and transparency, in breach of international law, and failed to meet
the procedural requirements set out in the Uzbek Bankruptcy Law, in
particular with respect to the provision of notifications as well as with
respect to the duties of the court managers towards both creditors of AGF
and the debtor itself. These breaches caused Claimant to suffer further harm.
Although force majeure had already been declared, the bankruptcy
proceedings confirmed to outside observers that Claimant’s investment —
which was by then fully in the hands of Respondent — was a no-go zone.
Other specific quantifiable harm, over and above the damages assessed by
Claimant’s quantum experts, has not been evaluated and Claimant repeats
as it did at the outset of this section that its case does not depend in any way
upon Respondent’s pathological failings in respect of the AGF liquidation
procedure, in order for the Tribunal to be in a position to render a decision
in Claimant’s favour regarding the merits of its claim.”

(b) Respondent's Position

769. In general, Respondent contends that the FET standard is not designed to serve as
investment insurance, and does not protect the investor from the State’s exercise
of its legitimate right to regulate in the public interest, or from reasonable State
action taken in response to the investor’s own misconduct or wrongdoing. With
regard to the role of legitimate expectations of the investor, these legitimate
expectations are not subjective expectations of the specific investor, but rather
those that are grounded in objective factors flowing from representations made by
the State to the investor, in light of all relevant circumstances prevailing at that
time, and that the assessment of an investor’s legitimate expectations thus must
take into account the investor’s own conduct in obtaining and implementing the
investment. Accordingly, an investor is not entitled to claim that its legitimate
expectations were frustrated by any corrective measures taken by the host State to
address harm caused by the investor (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 887 fol.).

303

770.

771.

772.

773.

In this regard, Respondent contends that Claimant fully exhausted all of the oxide
ores during Phase 1, and caused AGF to fail through its own self-dealing, fraud,
theft, mismanagement, and inability to implement the Project as promised. As
such, the various acts about which Claimant complains, were fully justified in the
circumstances, either as a result of Claimant’s own failures or other legitimate
considerations, and did not cause AGF’s insolvency (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014,
para. 60).

In addition, with respect to denial of justice, Respondent demonstrated that the
FET standard is not an open invitation to second-guess the decisions of the host
State’s courts, but relates to the failure of the host State’s legal system as a whole
to accord justice. Thus, a claimant alleging a denial of justice bears a particularly
heavy burden of proof and there can be no denial of justice until local remedies
have been exhausted, and a failure to do so is per se sufficient to exclude the
State’s responsibility (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 889, relying in particular
on Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic, para. 215, RL-204, and Loewen v. USA, para.
154, RL-260).

Respondent’s approach is similar with regard to the alleged breach of the standard
of reasonableness: The appropriate standard of measure is “a reasonable and
proportionate reaction to objectively verifiable circumstances.” (Ulysseas v.
Ecuador, para. 319, RL-303; Enron v. Argentina, para. 281, RL-235). Thus, there
can be no unreasonableness or arbitrariness in the present case because, in taking
the corrective measures that it took with respect to AGF, Respondent acted in all
respects within its legal rights, for rational reasons, and did not act
disproportionally or contrary to the rule of law (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013,
para. 451; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 913).

As concerns the standard of protection from discriminatory treatment, Respondent
contends that Claimant would need to show that certain measures adopted by
Respondent were directed specifically against Claimant by reason of its
nationality, and that comparable entities in similar-situated position were treated
more favorably. However, Claimant has failed to adduce such evidence (Resp.
Am .Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 914, 919).

In summary, the actions that Respondent took in the present case with respect to
AGF comported with Uzbek law and were undertaken for rational reasons to
address AGF’s continued failures and serious violations of law. In particular,
Respondent denies a breach of any standard under Article 2(2) of the BIT based
on the following key arguments:

304

774.

775.

As concerns the changes in tax benefits and VAT regimes: According to
Respondent, AGF’s tax benefits and privileges, including the stabilization
guarantee, were expressly conditioned on its proper implementation of the Project
and on its compliance with Uzbek law. These benefits and privileges were
justifiably revoked through Decrees No. 74 and No. 133, as a result of AGF’s
repeated failures to comply with the approved technical and economic parameters
of the Project, as well as its serious violations of Uzbek law. For example, AGF
failed year after year to fulfil its production obligations, AGF also maintained all
of its foreign currency revenue offshore, without repatriating the promised hard
currency, dividends and taxes that were the basis for obtaining its privileges and
benefits. Thus, the stabilization clause was lawfully revoked by Decrees No. 74
and No. 133. In addition, certain privileges were in any event intended to remain
in effect only for a limited period of time and had Claimant implemented Phase 1
and Phase 2 in a timely manner, AGF’s privileges relating to VAT and profit tax
would have lapsed according to their own terms in 2006 and the stabilization
clause would have lapsed on 1 July 2010 with no right of AGF to obtain an
extension thereof. The same applies to the stabilization guarantee included in the
Law on Foreign Investment (see above para. 44): This stabilization clause which
applied to “foreign investments within ten years of the date of investment” was
not extended when Claimant replaced Lonrho in July 2002, and thus expired
according to its own terms in September 2004, i.e. ten years after AGF’s
establishment on 22 September 1994. Further, the revocation of AGF’s tax
privileges in 2006 did not have a significant impact on AGF’s operations, as the
Working Group established pursuant to Decree No. 74 agreed to defer AGF’s
additional tax obligations and Claimant’s special dividend obligations, thus
ensuring that AGF’s operations were not harmed by the revocation of AGF’s
privileges (see above para. 550). As concerns the VAT changes in 2011, they
occurred after the stabilization clause elapsed on | July 2010 and had no impact
on AGF’s operations, since AGF had already left Uzbekistan in March 2011 and
did not pay any taxes in 2011. The 2009 and 2011 VAT changes did further not
target or discriminate against Claimant, but applied generally to all producers of
precious metals operating in Uzbekistan, and were thus not discriminatory (Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 892-898; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 73 fol.;
Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 14 fol.);

As concerns the non-issuance or non-renewal of licenses: Respondent rejects a
breach of the FET standard for the same reasons as it rejected a claim for
expropriation (see above para. 725 (xi)). According to Respondent, the non
issuance/non-renewal of licenses was linked to reasons attributable to Claimant, in
particular AGF’s failure to submit timely and/or complete applications and its
repeated violations of Uzbek mining and safety laws. In any event, the non-
issuance of such liceneses did not prevent Claimant from operating since the
Government actually allowed Claimant to operate during the renewal process. As
such, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that the alleged non-issuance or non-

305

776.

777.

renewal of AGF’s licenses had any causal impact on AGF’s operations, nor is
there any evidence that it directly impacted Claimant’s efforts to obtain financing
for Phase 2 (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 899-901; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014,
paras. 90 fol.; Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 22 fol.).

As concerns the silver refining: Respondent contends that AGF agreed at the very
outset of the silver project to refine all silver in Uzbekistan according to
Respondent’s recognized public policy of exporting only refined precious metals.
In addition, the problems with the silver refining were attributable to AGF’s
incapacity to deliver silver doré of sufficient purety, and not to any alleged lack of
experience and expertise of AGMK. Further, as Claimant itself admitted (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 852), silver processing was not initially incorporated
as part of Claimant’s AGF’s plan, so Claimant could not have had legitimate
expectations with respect to AGF’s silver operations, much less any expectation
that Respondent would permit AGF to refine its doré offshore, in contravention of
its policy (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 902; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras.
86 fol.). As concerns Claimant’s purchase of its own refinery, AGF’s shareholders
unanimously agreed to postpone consideration of Claimant’s proposal until
AGF’s financial situation had stabilized, which it never did. As such, there was no
“refusal” or “unfair, inequitable interference with the management”, but rather
Claimant acted on its own initiative and at its own risk (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014,
para. 89).

As concerns the Guarantee Letter and the Special Dividend Agreement: These
agreements were reasonable and justified and the result of Claimant’s own
wrongdoing, i.e. its conscious decision not to register the April 2003 Gold Offtake
Agreement as required by Decree No. 988 (see above para. 411) and the
misrepresentation of its financial capacity. The problem was not the hedging, but
rather the price of the contract, which did not conform to the market price as of
the date of the HGOA’s signing in January 2004 or the date when the HGOA was
submitted for registration in March 2004 (see above paras. 441 fol.). While the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations Investment & Trade could not register
the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement, because it violated Uzbek law, the Ministry
of Finance nonetheless agreed to allow AGF to export gold at a below-market
hedged price on the condition that Claimant would reimburse the State for its
share of any lost revenue up to a capped amount. Moreover, Claimant actually
willingly entered into the Special Dividend Agreement and repeatedly recognized
its debt thereunder. It is actually undisputed that Claimant paid only USD 1
million under the Special Dividend Agreement, and that its outstanding liability as
of 6 September 2010 was USD 10,841,256.16. Contrary to Claimant’s allegations,
Respondent did not refuse to consider alternative payment terms, as Claimant
erroneously asserts. In 2007, Respondent agreed in good faith to defer Claimant’s
payment obligations by two years, without interest (see above para. 550). In 2009,
Respondent agreed to Claimant’s proposed three-party agreement to transfer the

306

72.

779.

780.

special dividend liability to AGF, and to offset that liability against VAT
reimbursements owed to AGF (Tursunov II, para. 6, 12-13; Tursunov I, para. 18).
However, according to Mr. Hill’s testimony, AGF refused because the Special
Dividend Agreement concerned Claimant and not AGF (Hill I { 110). Thus, it is
Claimant, not Respondent who acted in bad faith (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014,
paras. 906-909; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 61 fol., 70).

As concerns Claimant’s allegations of discriminatory treatment in respect of the
Special Dividend Agreement, they are unfounded. Claimant bore the obligations
under the Special Dividend Agreement not on account of Claimant’s UK
nationality, but because Claimant — and not AGF or the Uzbek Parties —
negotiated the loan with Standard Bank, which obligated AGF to sell its gold at
hedged prices, in violation of Uzbek law. In such circumstances, it was entirely
reasonable for the Government to require Claimant to reimburse the State, through
the Ministry of Finance, for its share of any lost revenue. The Guarantee Letters
and Special Dividend Agreement as well as the Deed of Reconciliation were thus
not discriminatory, but rather the direct result of Claimant’s own conduct. (Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 920).

Further, as concerns the legal proceedings initiated in order to enforce the debt
under the Special Dividend Agreement, Claimant failed to exhaust all local
remedies by not appealing the decision of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme
Court of the Republic of Uzbekistan (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 906-909).

As concerns the Audits 2006 and 2011]: Respondent rejects the claim in relation to
the Audits 2006 and 2011, for the same reasons it rejected Claimant’s claim for
expropriation (see above para. 725): According to Respondent, these Audits were
in full compliance with the law and actually identified wrongdoings by Claimant
(Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 910; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 439
fol.).

(i) As concerns the Complex Audit 2006, Claimant’s complaints are
directed mainly at the result of the Audit which led to penalties imposed
upon AGF. However, these penalties were subject to judicial review and
were largely overturned. Claimant does not dispute that the levy of
AGF’s bank accounts complied fully with Uzbek law, or that it was lifted
in December 2006, merely two months after it was imposed. In the
absence of any evidence of arbitrariness or impropriety, the State’s
lawful exercise of its right to assess taxes and penalites, and the Court’s
subsequent control of those taxes and penalites, cannot give rise to any
Treaty violation (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 83 fol.).

307

781.

782.

(ii) As concerns the Audit 2011, as explained in the context of the
expropriation claim (see above para. 725), Respondent’s position is that
the Audit 2011 was ordered and conducted in full compliance with the
law and authorized by the Republic Council for Coordination. Claimant
has failed to demonstrate that the Audit 2011, and the manner in which it
was conducted, deprived Claimant of the use, enjoyment, or value of its
investment (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 96 fol.; Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, paras. 32 fol.).

As concerns the non-approval of the Phase 2 Feasibility Study: As already
mentioned above with regard to the expropriation claim (see above para. 727),
Respondent contends that it did not approve the Phase 2 Feasibility Study because
Claimant failed to meet the applicable requirements. In particular, the Phase 2
Feasibility Study exceeded the previously approved costs by USD 100 million and
failed to provide requested information regarding equipment costs and financing
(Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 278). These requirements were imposed by
Uzbek law, namely Decree No. 110, and were based on valid and reasonable
policy reasons. To the extent that AGF failed to fulfil these requirements, the
refusal by Respondent to approve the Phase 2 Feasibility Study was in accordance
with Uzbek law. In addition, contrary to Claimant’s assertions regarding a lack of
transparency, Claimant did monitor and was aware of the Government’s review
process, and was fully aware of the objections of each Ministry to its Feasibility
Study (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 903-904).

As concerns the liquidation proceedings: According to Respondent, the Uzbek
Parties’ requests for voluntary liquidation were fully justified in the circumstances
and were based on, among other things, AGF’s failure to meet its production
obligations, its failure to pay dividends, and its lack of solvency. Moreover,
Claimant refused to participate in any shareholders meeting and the Uzbek
Partners thus could and did never take any action to put AGF into voluntary
liquidation (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 905). As to the bankruptcy
proceedings, they were initiated by a third party and neither by the Uzbek Partners
nor by the State. In addition, the bankruptcy proceedings could not have resulted
in any harm to Claimant or to AGF, because, at the time these proceedings began,
Claimant, through its management and control of AGF, already had fully
exhausted all of the oxide ores during Phase 1; had never presented an
economically acceptable and Bankable Feasibility Study to obtain the right to
develop Phase 2; had caused AGF to go bankrupt through its own self-dealing,
fraud, theft, mismanagement, and inability to implement the Project as promised,
and had abandoned AGF and had lef Uzbekistan more than one year earlier on
pretextual grounds. It should further be noted that Claimant failed to make use of
its right to appeal the bankruptcy decision, notwithstanding that, contrary to
Claimant’s assertions, it had been informed of the date, time and location of all
the creditors’ Committee Meetings in advance of each meeting, and has been

308

783.

784.

785.

expressly requested to send an authorized representative to participate, but, to
date, had failed to do so (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 911; Resp. PHB I.
21.07.2014, paras. 103 fol.; Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 35 fol.) As concerns
the drill rig, Respondent’s position is as described above in para. 728.

As concerns the criminal proceedings: Contrary to Claimant’s assertions, there is
no evidence that the criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions initiated
by the Prosecutor’s office in May 2011, after the 2011 Audit, were designed to
pressure Claimant or to prevent it from returning to Uzbekistan, after it had
abandoned AGF on pretextual grounds in March 2011. Nor is there any evidence
of any torture, abuse, or other mistreatment by the criminal authorities in this case.
To the contrary, the criminal proceedings were initiated on the basis of evidence
of criminal wrongdoing and carried out in full accordance with Uzbek law. The
criminal proceedings, moreover, could not have harmed Claimant or AGF,
because, at the time they began in May 2011, Claimant already had abandoned
AGF (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 100 fol.; Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras.
45 fol.).

2.3.1.2. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

(a) The Applicable Legal Basis (Reminder)

As quoted above (para. 312), Article 2(2) of the BIT provides as follows:

“ (2) Investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall
at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy
full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting
Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures the | management,
maintenance, use enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of
nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. Each
Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party. [...]”

For the reasons mentioned above (see paras. 319 fol.), the Arbitral Tribunal
considers that the duty to refrain from unreasonable or discriminatory measures as
provided in Article 2(2) of the BIT are subsumed under the broader FET standard
and that a behavior which is unreasonable or discriminatory in the sense of Article
2(2) would at the same time constitute a breach of the FET standard. This is not to
say that both standards are fully equivalent, in particular — as explained above
(para. 323) — the FET standard may have a broader scope than the more specific
duties to act in a reasonable and non-discriminatory way.

309

786.

787.

788.

789.

790.

As set out above (see paras. 319 fol.), the FET standard as contemplated by
Article 2(2) must be understood as a means to guarantee justice to foreign
investors, and when doing so, for the States’ actions to give due regard to an
investor’s legitimate expectations by refraining from taking measures which are
not justified under the circumstances, i.e. which are unreasonable,
disproportionate or discriminatory.

As such, and considering that the factual basis for Claimant’s claims for breach of
FET as well as of breach of the prohibition of arbitrary, unreasonable or
discriminatory treatment under Article 2(2) is the same, theses claims will be
examined together.

(b) The Key Issue

The key question is thus whether any of the main actions or omissions of
Respondent taken as a whole can be deemed to have breached the FET standard or
any of the thereto related standards provided for in Article 2(2) of the BIT.

‘When examining this question, the Arbitral Tribunal will proceed in a largely
chronological analysis of the key events, with some exceptions however in order
to re-group related issues which spread over a longer period of time.

(c) As Concerns the Allegedly Unfair Prevention to Export Gold and the
Allegedly Unfair and Inequitable Imposing of the Guarantee Letters and
the Special Dividend Agreement:

It arises out of the evidence at stake that:

- On 31 May 2002, an AGF Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders decided to enter into a loan agreement with Société
Générale for USD 31 million, providing for a security in the form
of a hedging offtake agreement (see above para. 418);

- On 17 July 2002, ORC and AGF entered into the Credit
Agreement with Société Générale and other banks, which
provided in Article 12.24.1 that AGF would “enter into and
maintain in full force and effect each Hedging Agreement.” (see
above para. 419) (Exhs. C-496 / R-1026);

- On 2 April 2003, Société Générale was replaced by Standard
Bank according to the Financing Agreement (Exh. C-219), but
the hedging principles of the Credit Agreement remained in place
(see above para. 430);

310

On 15 April 2003, AGF and Standard Bank entered into the
Original Gold Offtake Agreement (Exh. C-222), which provided
for the sale to Standard Bank of 263,096 ounces of gold at a
hedged price of USD 323,35 per ounce (which corresponded to
the market price of gold as of 15 April 2003) (see above
para. 432).

It is undisputed that this Original Gold Offtake Agreement was
not filed for registration with the relevant Uzbek authorities,
although it arises out of the record that the Uzbek authorities
were aware of the hedging provisions (see for example above
paras. 431 and 433).

On 20 January 2004, AGF and Standard Bank entered into the
Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement (Exh. C-225) which provided
for the same hedging principle and price as the Original Gold
Offtake Agreement. This Agreement was then submitted to
AFER for registration and licensing a few days later (see above
paras. 440-441).

On 16 February 2004, Mr. Nazhimov of MinFERIT informed
AGF that although the export of gold was not subject to a special
license, the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement was subject to
registration “in the manner prescribed by law.” (see above para.
442).

Further correspondence then followed regarding the registration
of the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement, and in particular the fact
that the agreed hedged price of USD 323,35 per ounce did not
correspond to the market price in January 2004, but was
substantially lower (see above paras. 443 fol.).

It is further undisputed that the Uzbek Government allowed the
export of gold by AGF only after Oxus signed a Guarantee Letter
on 13 March 2004 and two Amended Guarantee Letters on 1 and
2 April 2004 (see above para. 451 and 461). Permission to export
the gold was granted on 6 April 2004 through the Decree No. 213
(see above para. 462) and took place after the registration of the
Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement by the National Bank and the
State Customs (see above para. 463).

This delay in the export of the gold produced by AGF caused
AGF to default on the delivery terms of gold shipments to

311

791.

792.

Standard Bank (see above paras. 447 and 459), which caused
financial damage to AGF.

- The terms of the three Guarantee Letters of March and April
2004 were further re-stated in the Special Dividend Agreement of
12 July 2004 (Exh. C-252). Under this Agreement, Oxus
undertook to pay to the Uzbek Ministry of Finance “Additional
Income” corresponding to the difference between the current
world price of the gold on the date of sale and the hedged gold
price pursuant to the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement. The date
for repayment was 31 October 2008 (see above para. 466).

- Enforcement of the Special Dividend Agreement in 2010.

The key question here is whether Respondent’s refusal to let AGF export the gold
and its requirement to enter into the Guarantee Letters and Special Dividend
Agreement constitute a breach of the standards under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider this to be the case for the following

reasons:

0)

(ii)

Decree No. 988, in force at the time of entering into both the Original
Offtake Agreement and the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement, provides
that export-import contracts require registration with the Ministry of
Foreign Economic Relations and that in order to obtain such registration,
it is necessary, among others, that “prices specified in the contract
correspond to average international prices and existing state of the
market” (Exh. R-239; see above para. 411). Whilst it is true that Decree
No. 477 grants AGF the right to sell gold at world prices and to secure
credits, Decree No. 477 cannot be understood as providing an
unconditional right to do so and, in particular, gives no indication
regarding the relevant time for the determination of “world prices”. As
such, Decree No. 988 is not in conflict with Decree No. 477.

It is undisputed that AGF only filed for official registration of the
Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement in January 2004, whereby the
agreement still contained the hedged prices of USD 323,35 per ounce
corresponding to the market price in April 2003. In January 2004, the
market price for gold had however reached USD 410. As such, the price
of the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement did not conform with the market
price in the sense of Decree No. 988. As a result, the Hedged Gold
Offtake Agreement did not fulfill the legal requirement for registration.

(v)

In addition, while the record shows that Oxus and AGF expressed serious
concerns about the impact of Respondent’s refusal to allow the export of
gold and their view that the Government’s approach towards the hedge
price was unjustified, neither Oxus nor AGF objected to the
Government’s request to enter into the Guarantee Letters and/or the
Special Dividend Agreement as being unfair or arbitrary (see above
paras. 443-458). On the contrary, the record shows that Oxus repeatedly
acknowledged the debt under the Special Dividend Agreement without
reserving its rights (see e.g. above paras 513, 517, 557, 558, 593 and
Exhibits C-291, C-365, C-540 and R-883, R-884 and R-1016).

As concerns the enforcement of the Special Dividend Agreement, the
Arbitral Tribunal considers that the record shows a certain flexibility of
the Uzbek Government, which was willing to defer payment and
ultimately also to suspend the legal enforcement proceedings. As to the
court proceedings themselves, the Arbitral Tribunal does not find that the
threshold of a “denial of justice” is reached. As mentioned previously,
Claimant repeatedly acknowledged the debt under the Special Dividend
Agreement and as concerns the various procedural steps, the record
shows that Claimant was aware of these main steps and requested various
postponement of hearings, some of which were granted.

It is nevertheless true that the process of obtaining the permission was
not very smooth. It appears that Claimant and/or AGF had to write to
various ministries and received partially contradictory information.
Whilst AFER refused to register the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement
(see above para. 444), MinFERIT seemed to say that the contract was to
be deemed a “loan agreement” rather than an export agreement, and
would thus not be subject to registration by AFER, but rather by the
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank (see above para. 452).
Ultimately, it appears that the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement did not
require separate registration by the Central Bank, but required
supplementary registration with the Customs (see above paras. 454, 456,
463). However, such kind of “bureaucratic hurdle” is not uncommon in
developing and strongly bureaucratic States, especially with regard to
sophisticated agreements such as the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement.
Indeed, the qualification of such agreement as an export contract or a
loan contract was not a straightforward exercise. Each ministry or
department interpreted the Agreement and the relevant legal provisions
in a self-centered way, without giving much regard to the overall
situation. This is however, unfortunately, a common feature of
bureaucracy, and is not peculiar to either Uzbekistan or AGF’s specific
situation. In addition, even if the process was not straightforward, one
cannot disregard the fact that the Uzbek Government eventually

313

793.

794.

intervened through the Cabinet of Ministers to resolve the situation
within a couple of months by instructing the relevant departments to
register the agreement and allow the export, in exchange of the signature
of the Guarantee Letters and the Special Dividend Agreement. In other
words, the Cabinet of Ministers looked for a solution which allowed to
respect Uzbek law while keeping the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement in
effect.

(vi) Thus, whilst the Arbitral Tribunal understands that Oxus was under
pressure to unlock the situation and may have agreed to enter into certain
agreements without a strong power of negotiation, this pressure cannot
be deemed as the result of “coercion” by the Uzbek Government but
rather it is the result of the time elapsed between the first Original
Offtake Agreement and the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement for which
Claimant and AGF bear responsibility and the fact that the Hedged Gold
Offtake Agreement was not in compliance with Uzbek law.

As such, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that, giving due regard to the state
of development of Uzbekistan, its legal and political framework as well as the
sophistication of the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement, the difficulties in getting it
registered and obtaining the permission to export the gold and the conclusion of
the Guarantee Letters and Special Dividend Agreement were not of a nature that
reaches the threshold of a breach of the FET standard or of an arbitrary or
unreasonable measure.

The remaining question is whether the requirement to enter into the Guarantee
Letters and the Special Dividend Agreement adressed to Oxus, before granting
permission to export the gold under the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement could be
deemed a discriminatory measure under Article 2(2) of the BIT. As explained
above (paras 784-787), the standard of discrimination refers primarily to a
discrimination based on nationality. In the present case, there is no indication that
any such measure was taken based on Oxus’ British nationality. Further, whilst it
is true that Oxus had to bear the responsibility for the price difference alone, and
that there would have been reasons to impose such responsibility on all of AGF’s
shareholders (given that the loan and hedging had been approved by all
shareholders, see above para. 418), it is also true that it is Oxus which took the
lead and had the know-how to negotiate and conclude such agreement and did not
consult with the Uzbek Parties regarding the hedged price. In addition, under the
SDA, Claimant is only required to bear 50% of the variation in the marked price.
As such, the decision to request Claimant to bear such price difference cannot be
seen as arbitrary, unfair or discriminatory in the sense of Art. 2(2) of the BIT.

314

795. Thus, in conclusion, Respondent’s request that Claimant enter into the Guarantee
Letters and the Special Dividend Agreement before granting permission to export
the gold under the Hedged Gold Offtake Agreement is not in breach of the FET
standard and cannot be deemed to constitute an arbitrary, unreasonable or
discriminatory action under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

(d) As Concerns the Complex Audit 2006:

796. It arises the following out of the evidence at stake:

- In July 2006, the State Tax Committee conducted a Complex
Audit at AGF concerning the latter’s compliance with tax,
currency and customs law (see above para. 482).

- In August 2006, the State Tax Committee and the State Customs
Committee issued the result of their Audit in the form of the
Complex Audit Report 2006 and the Inspection Act (see above
para. 484) which identified various lack of compliance triggering
fines and penalties in the amount of approx. USD 225 million
(see above para. 484).

- In September 2006, the State Tax Committee initiated
enforcement proceedings of these fines and penalties before the
Navoi Economic Court and the Regional State Customs
Department issued various collection orders, which were
confirmed by the Navoi Regional Economic Court and led to the
freezing of AGF’s bank accounts, fixed assets and finished
products in Uzbekistan (see above paras. 487 fol.).

- AGF strongly objected to the findings of the Complex Audit
2006 and appealed against the decision of the Navoi Regional
Economic Court before the Board of Appeal of such Court. The
Board of Appeal largely reversed the decisions of the lower court
and reduced the fines and penalties to an amount of 16,954,600
soums, i.e. approx. USD 7,000 (see above para. 496). This
decision was further confirmed by the Navoi Superior Economic
Court (see above para. 497).

797. It appears that Claimant’s claim with regard to the Complex Audit 2006 is
directed primarily at the result of the Audit and the way it was enforced, rather
then at the way the Audit was conducted.

315

798.

799.

The key question here is thus whether the result of the Audit was arbitrary or
unfair, and/or whether it was enforced in an arbitrary or unfair manner in the sense
of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider this to be the case for the following
reasons:

(i) It is undisputed that AGF was not fully compliant with all tax, foreign
currency and customs law, in particular with regard to the way AGF
managed foreign currency through its Barclays account. In fact, the
record, in particular Mr. Narziev’s letter of 13 September 2006 as well as
the 2005 and 2006 AGF internal Audits (see above paras. 208, 225, 488),
shows that Claimant was aware of such non-compliance. In particular,
Mr. Narziev, AGF’s chief accountant, notified Messrs Hill, Suter,
Wilkins, Kipps and Boyjigitov that it was strictly forbidden for AGF to
make payments from its Barclays Bank account under import contracts,
and from receiving into that account foreign currency revenue from its
export activities (Exh. R-176 ; see above para. 488). Nothwithstanding
this warning, Claimant benefited from the money on the Barclays Bank
account in disregard of the applicable restrictions.

(ii) As such, the Complex Audit 2006 and the way it was enforced could
only be in breach of the protection standards provided for under Article
2(2) of the BIT, if it transpired that the fines and penalties imposed were
in no proportion to the actual lack of compliance. The Arbitral Tribunal
does however not consider such exercise to fall under its scope of
competence where such fines and penalties were, as is the case here,
subject to review by the national courts and the national courts actually
drastically reduced the fines and penalties. Under such circumstances, the
only question that the Arbitral Tribunal can review if whether the court
proceedings themselves were in breach of the standards of protection
under Article 2(2) of the BIT in the sense that it may be deemed to
constitute a denial of justice.

(iii) The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that the judicial process applied
in the circumstances amounts to either a procedural or a substantive
denial of justice. Upon appeal, AGF was granted a very significant
reduction in the fines imposed by the lower tribunal and the Tribunal has
received no evidence showing that this last decision was not justified.

316

800. In conclusion, the result of the Complex Audit 2006 and the way it was enforced

80

by the Uzbek authorities is not in breach of the FET standard and cannot be
deemed to constitute an arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory action under
Article 2(2) of the BIT.

(e) As Concerns the Atlas Copco Drill Rig

. As mentioned above (para. 755), the Arbitral Tribunal found that the

circumstances surrounding Claimant’s claims concerning the drill rig (Claimant
No. 1583.9, see above para. 133) did not amount to an expropriation of the drill
rig. For the very same reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that these circumstances
do also not amount to a breach of any of the protection standards provided for
under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

(f) As Concerns Claimant’s Silver Refining Plant:

802. It arises the following out of the evidence at stake:

- At some point, AGF decided to export the silver obtained through
the treatment of doré bars, which it considered to be entitled to do
under Decree No. 477 (see above para. 424).

- AGF was required to work with AMGK for the refining of the
silver doré bars and they entered into the Silver Refining
Agreement on 29 March 2007 (see above para. 507), although
Claimant would have preferred to sub-contract the refining of
silver to Metalor of Switzerland, which was apparently more
experienced and cheaper (see above para. 506).

- AMGK’s capacity was originally not sufficient and it increased
such capacity on request of Goskomgeology (see above paras.
504-505).

- The refining of silver by AMGK did not meet the expected
targets in terms of quality and production volume. It is disputed
whether this resulted from AGF’s failure to deliver doré bars of
sufficient quality, or from AMGK’s inability to adequately refine
sufficient quantity of doré bars. In this regard, the record contains
letters of complaint from AGF as well as letters of complaint
from AMGK (see above para. 504).

- The original Silver Refining Agreement was amended in total 8
times, whereby the amendments focused on specifying the

317

requirements as to the level of purity of the doré bars and their
terms and modality of delivery by AGF (see above paras. 508,
512, No. 3, 519, 523, 525 and 528).

- Because of the insufficient silver refining, AGF accumulated
stockpile of silver doré bars up to a value of approx.
USD 15 million by November 2007 (see above para. 513). Whilst
AGF requested the Uzbek Government to either set-off the
stockpile with the debt under the Special Dividend Agreement, or
to allow a one-off shipment of such silver doré bars abroad (i.e.
for refining by and sale to Metalor) (see above paras. 513 and
517), the Uzbek Government did not agree to any of these
options.

- Because of the dissatisfaction with the refining of silver by
AMGK, Claimant suggested that AGF purchase its own silver
refinery and submitted this proposal to the Annual General
Shareholder Meeting of 28 September 2008. The Minutes of the
Meeting provide that the shareholders resolved to consider such
proposal after the financial situation of AGF would have
improved. It is however disputed between the Parties whether this
resolution reflects the true outcome of the discussion of the
shareholders (see above para. 518). In any event, it appears that
Claimant purchased a silver refinery from Italy for a price of
USD 752,385.47 (see above para. 688), but that it was prevented
from installing and using this refinery to refine the silver doré
bars.

- At the same time that AGF and AMGK kept amending the Silver
Refining Agreement, AGF also entered into an agreement with
Metalor covering the refining of doré bars (see above para. 521).
It appears that the Uzbek authorities considered this agreement to
be in breach of Uzbek law because AGF had failed to conduct a
tender required under Uzbek law (see above para. 522). This
prevented AGF from implementing its agreement with Metalor
and AGF had to continue working with AMGK.

803. The key question here is thus whether the Respondent’s insistence that AGF work
with AMGK for the refining of silver, Respondent’s refusal to allow AGF to make
a one-off shipment of the doré bars and/or to set-off the value of the doré bars
with the debt under the Special Dividend Agreement and/or the fact that AGF was
prevented from using the silver refinery purchased from Italy was in breach of the
protection standards provided for under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

318

804. The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider this to be the case for the following
reasons:

- Claimant relies on the standard of protection of Article 2(2) of the
BIT to claim that Respondent’s actions with regard to the silver
refining were unfair, arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory
and relies partly on Article 4 of Decree No. 477 and Article 10 of
the Law on Foreign Investment. Respondent stresses that Article
4 of Decree No. 477 refers to the export of refined gold and silver
and does not provide Claimant with a right to export unrefined
gold or silver, i.e. silver doré bars. While the wording of Article 4
of Decree No. 477 is not crystal clear and refers, in Claimant’s
translation, to “gold, silver and other products obtained from
mining”, the letter from the CabMin of 23 August 2002 refers
more precisely to “gold, silver and other products obtained
during the treatment of gold deposits” (see above para. 424). The
Arbitral Tribunal however considers it reasonable to interpret this
provision, as Respondent does, as referring to refined products
only. Indeed, it is legitimate for a State to require that the
exploitation of its natural resources benefit the local industry and
that relevant works be sub-contracted to local companies,
provided that such companies are able to develop the necessary
know-how and technology. In any event, Claimant has not
expressly contested the fact that Article 4 of Decree No. 477
applies only to refined products.

- In fact, Claimant takes issue with the fact that AGF was
prevented from resorting to more efficient ways of refining silver,
be it through the use of a foreign refinery (Metalor) or its own
refinery, is in breach of the protection standards under Article
2(2) of the BIT.

- However, there are several problems with this claim:

- Claimant’s claim is largely based on the assumption that
the problems regarding the silver refining were due to
AMGK’s inability to refine silver in sufficient quantity
and quality and that the other option would have been
more efficient and profitable. However, the record does
not allow to conclude that AMGK was solely responsible
for the insufficient silver refining. In fact, the record
instead shows that AGF also bore part of the
responsibility. This is in particular established by the
content of the various amendments to the Silver Refining

319

Agreement which aimed at improving the quality and
modalities of the delivery of silver doré bars by AGF.

- In addition, in view of this shared responsibility, there is
no certainty that a refining through Metalor or by AGF
itself would have yielded better results, in particular in
view of all other operational problems AGF was suffering
from.

Claimant’s claim is further based on the assumption that
Claimant had a legitimate expectation to be entitled to either sub-
contract the refining of silver to a company abroad or to proceed
with the refining of silver by itself. However, Claimant has failed
to establish that it had such legitimate expectation, in particular
given that it admitted that “silver processing was not even
initially incorporated as part of Claimant’s AGF plan” and that
“silver extraction was not addressed in the production schedule.”
(see Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 852).

In addition, Claimant’s claim further assumes that Claimant had a
specific legitimate expectation to purchase and use its own
refinery. However, Claimant’s claim in this regard does not
stand. Firstly, it is based on the assumption that the purchase of
such refinery had been approved by at least a majority of the
shareholders. However, the Minutes of relevant Shareholders
Meetings do not support Claimant’s position. As concerns the
Minutes of the Shareholders Meeting of 24 April 2008 (see above
para. 516), whilst they confirm an agreement in principle, such
agreement was conditional upon the agreement of the Cabinet of
Ministers and was given also in view of a potential use of the
refinery in case AGF would obtain a license to mine Kosmanachi
and Okjetpes silver deposits. Thus, the shareholders’ resolution
cannot be interpreted as an explicit approval of purchase of the
specific silver refinery eventually purchased by Claimant. As
concerns the Minutes of the Shareholders Meeting of 29
September 2008 (see above para. 518), they explicitly mention
that “[c]onstruction of the silver refinery shall be considered after
the financial situation at AGF is stabilized and shall be at AGF's
own expense”, and it is undisputed that AGF’s financial situation
did not subsequently improve. Whilst Claimant argues that Mr.
Wilkins’ unwillingly signed these Minutes, Claimant does not
contest that Mr. Wilkins eventually signed the Minutes. In
addition, Claimant does not contest that the sale of such refinery
was subject to certain conditions and the record shows that

320

Claimant was very well aware of additional approval by the
Uzbek Government (C-299). Secondly, the purchase and use of
the refinery is primarily a matter under the competence of the
shareholders of AGF, and to the extent that there was no clear
agreement among the shareholders of AGF, it is unclear as to
what extent the Uzbek Government could be blamed for not
supporting such purchase. In other words, Claimant took the risk
of purchasing the refinery notwithstanding that such sale had not
been fully approved either by the Shareholders and/or by the
Uzbek Government.

Finally, as concerns the one-off sale, Claimant has failed to
establish that it had a legitimate expectation to be granted the
right to such one-off sale, given that it would have represented a
deviation from the Government’s legitimate requirement that
silver be primarily refined in Uzbekistan. What Claimant was
requesting from the Uzbek Government was more a “favour”
than the respect of a pre-existing right or legitimate expectation,
and the refusal of such “favour” cannot be deemed as a breach of
any of the protection standards under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

805. Under these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimant has failed to
establish that the requirement to refine silver through AMGK, the refusal to
approve a one-off sale of doré bars to Metalor and/or the refusal by the Uzbek
Parties to use the refinery purchased by Claimant from Italy is in breach of Article

2(2) of the BIT.

(g) As Concerns the Non-Issuance or Non-Renewal of Licenses:

806. Claimant’s claim concerning the non-issuance or non-renewal of licenses
concerns four different licenses, namely: (i) the general Mining License, which
expired in 2006 (see above para. 499, (ii) the Sarybatyr License (see above paras.
548 and 585), (iii) the Cyanide License (see above paras. 472 and 629) and (iv)
the Renewed Exploration License (see above paras. 533 and 588).

807. It arises the following out of the evidence at stake:

The Mining License was first issued on 28 November 2001 (see
above para. 415) for a duration of five years, i.e. until 27
November 2006. In December 2005 and January 2006, AGF filed
for renewal of this Mining License first before the Deputy Prime
Minister and then before Sanoat (see above paras. 474 and 476).
As of 23 November 2006, AGF had not received any feedback

321

from the Uzbek authorities (see above para. 499). On 24
November 2006, Mr. Saidov, the Head of Sanoat, informed AGF
that the renewal of AGF’s Mining License was under review, and
that pending this review, AGF could continue its activities under
the license until 28 December 2006 (see above para. 500). On 27
December 2006, Mr. Alibaev from Sanoat informed AGF again
that AGF was permitted to continue its mining activities on the
basis of the expired mining-activity license, without indicating
the duration of such permission or the time it would take to
decide on the renewal (see above para. 503). On 26 August 2009,
Mr. Mamaladiev from the relevant department of the CabMin
informed AGF that its request for issuance of the Mining License
was under review (see above para. 586). It appears that the
Mining License was never officially renewed, although the record
does not contain any official refusal of such Mining License and
that AGF was not prevented from continuing to perform its
mining activities.

The Cyanide License was first issued on 23 September 2005 (see
above para. 472) for a duration of five years, i.e. until
23 September 2010. On 22 September 2010, Mr. Salamatin of
AGF sent a letter to the CabMin explaining that the Cyanide
License was expiring on 23 September 2010 and that because of
negligence on behalf of AGF, all the renewal documents had not
been prepared on time. Mr. Salamatin thus requested to be
granted the right to continue the transportation and storage of
cyanide to extract precious metals during the renewal appraisal
period (see above para. 629). Thus, on 23 September 2010, the
Cyanide License expired. In the following days, AGF submitted
the relevant application documents (see above paras. 632 fol.) On
5 October 2010, Sanoat informed AGF that the Cyanide License
had expired on 23 September 2010 and that a “license
prolongation application was not made in time” and ordered AGF
to take disciplinary action against the staff responsible for the
oversight (see above para. 636). On 2 February 2011, Sanoat
allowed AGF to use, transport, and store poisonous substances
for a limited time period until 20 February 2011. This permission
was renewed on 7 April 2011, 6 June 2011, and 2 February 2012
(see above paras. 637-639). No formal license was ever issued
and there is no evidence that AGF was prevented from continuing
to use, transport and store cyanide.

The Renewed Exploration License was issued on 7 August 2007
(see above para. 533) for a duration of three years, i.e. until 7

322

808.

809.

August 2010. On 8 February 2010, AGF applied with
Goskomgeology for the renewal of the Renewed Exploration
License (see above para. 588). On 19 August 2010,
Goskomgeology updated the CabMin regarding the status of the
exploration works and the need for extension of the Renewed
Exploration License (see above para. 629). This License was
never renewed, although the record does not contain a formal
refusal by the Uzbek authorities.

- As concerns the Sarybatyr License, AGF applied for it for the
first time on 16 January 2009 before Goskomgeology (see above
para. 548). On 17 July 2009, AGF submitted the required
Feasibility Study to Goskomgeology (see above para. 584). On
17 August 2009, Goskomgeology followed up with Sanoat and
requested the issuance of the Sarybatyr License (see above para.
585). It appears that the Sarybatyr License was never issued,
although the record does not contain a formal refusal letter from
the Uzbek authorities.

The key question here is thus whether the Respondent’s non-renewal or non-
extension of the above mentioned licenses was in breach of the protection
standards provided for under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider this to be the case for the following
reasons:

(i) As concerns the Cyanide License, the Sarybatyr License and the
Renewed Exploration License:

- The requests for renewal or extension of licenses were subject to
the Law on Subsoil dated 23 September 1994 (Exh. C-263) as
amended by the new regime implemented in June 2007 through
Decrees No. PP-649 and No. 110 (see above para. 529 and 532).
This regime subjected the obtaining of licenses to certain
conditions, and also provided for the State’s right to limit,
suspend or terminate certain licenses (see e.g. Article 34 of the
Law on Subsoil).

- In addition, the General License Agreement between the CabMin
and AGF and each License was subject to specific terms and
conditions (see above para. 416). As concerns the Renewed
Exploration License, these conditions included in particular (i) to
meet the requirements established by Articles 11, 12, 16, 33, 35,

323

(ii)

36, 40, 43 and 45 of the Law on Subsoil, as well as (ii) “to
provide production or exploration works on the action space of
the JV in a strict compliance with the current regulations and
standards of geologic exploration of mineral resources” and (iii)
upon completion of the field works to do restoratory works to the
surface mining developments and holes (see above para. 533).

As concerns the Cyanide License, it is undisputed that AGF
submitted its application for renewal after the expiry of the
previous license due to a negligence of AGF itself. In addition,
the record shows that Sanoat had complained in the past of lack
of compliance by AGF with the terms of the license (see e.g. R-
198).

As concerns the Renewed Exploration License, it arises from the
record that AGF failed to conduct previous exploration works as
planned (see above para. 629; Goskomgeology’s letter of 19
August 2010). In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal has taken note
of Claimant’s challenges of Respondent’s exhibits and witness
statements, but is not convinced that this evidence suffers from
the alleged deficiencies or irregularities. In addition, Claimant
has failed to submit evidence showing that AGF had in the past
complied with all the terms and conditions of the Renewed
Exploration License and therefore fulfilled all the requirements
for the renewal of the license.

As concerns the Sarybatyr License, it was a first-time application
by Claimant. At that time however, i.e., 16 January 2009, AGF
was already in a very problematic state and had already stopped
the operation of its gold processing plant (see above para. 547).
In addition, it is undisputed that AGF did not submit a Pre-
Feasibility Study for the mining of gold in Sarybatyr as required
under Decrees PP-649 and No. 110 (see above para. 587).

As concerns the Mining License, Respondent’s main argument is to say
that Claimant repeatedly violated the terms of this license (see above
para. 727; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 90 fol.). However, the
contemporaneous record does not show that Respondent complained
about such violations. In particular, the correspondence from the Uzbek
authorities granting permission to continue mining activities (see above
para. 629) does not make any reference to such violations. However, it is
also true that the Complex State Audit, which was issued in August 2006
identified serious non-compliances with various regulations, including on
the operational level (see above para. 484). Even though the fines and

324

810.

811.

812.

813.

penalties were drastically reduced by the Uzbek courts, the reasons
therefore were largely procedural and did not amount to a reversal of the
findings of such non-compliances.

As such, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the mere fact that these four licenses
were not renewed or issued can per se not be deemed to be in breach of the
protection standards under Article 2(2) of the BIT, as Respondent had sufficient
justifiable reasons not to renew or issue such licenses. The question remains
however whether the fact that Respondent never officially rejected the
applications can be seen in breach of such standards.

It is true that an informal permission to continue operating after the expiry of
relevant licenses does not provide the investors with sufficient security to plan
ahead, and it could also have an impact on the financing of a project. It is further
true that the failure to render a formal decision on the applications is not in line
with Decree No. 112 (see above para. 450), which provides that the relevant body
shall inform the license applicant of the decision taken within 33 days as of the
filing of the application (see Article 14 of Decree No. 112). However, the non-
compliance with local regulations is per se not sufficient to trigger a breach of
BIT standards and the question of a breach of the FET standard or other protection
standards under Article 2(2) of the BIT must be examined based on the overall
circumstances of the case at hand.

In the present case, given the amount and level of seriousness of the problems
encountered by AGF, which undisputedly included issues of non-compliance with
tax, currency and operational regulations, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that
Respondent’s non-renewal or non-issuance of the above licenses does not reach
the required threshold. In fact, by informally allowing AGF to pursue its activities
under the expired licenses, Respondent was trying not to shut a door without
however providing rights that it considered unjustified. Thus, although this way of
proceeding is not totally in line with best practice standards of transparency and
due process, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that, in the present case, it does not
reach the standard of breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

That being said, it is true that as concerns the Mining License, the decision upon
its renewal was left open since 2006. That is a long time and it is true that if
Respondent was going to let AGF continue to extract gold and silver, it should
have provided for a clear legal instrument. As such, the non-renewal of the
Mining License could be considered in breach of the FET standard under Article
2(2) of the BIT. However, to the extent that (i) this did not prevent Claimant from
continuing the gold and silver extraction, (ii) that there is no record that Claimant
further insisted on the issuance of such license after 2006 and (iii) that Claimant
stopped the processing of gold in 2009 and would therefore have had problems to
request for its renewal, as it had expired on 27 November 2006, the Arbitral

325

817.

Tribunal is not convinced that the non-renewal of such Mining License is causal
for the damages claimed by Claimant in this regard.

In addition, the refusal to finance does not seem to have been a decision of CITIC
as such, but the result of a decision of a Chinese Ministry, which refused “an
outbound investment”. This arises our of the exchange of e-mails (Exh. C-511)
between Richard Shead and Long March Capital (the entity monitoring the CITIC
investment) in which the former requires “clarification from the Ministry on why
the outbound investment was declined.” Long March Capital replied that “to the
best of our knowledge, of the various approvals required in their entirety for the
proposed investment Oxus to proceed, the approval from the Ministry of
Commerce was not obtained. Hence none of the Chinese parties was authorized
to proceed with the investment. We have not received, nor have we requested, any
written clarification of the reason from the Ministry in respect of why the
approval was not provided. Long March Capital understands, although this is not
substantiated with any official documentation, that this may have had to do
with unqualified political risks associated with the proposed investment”
(emphasis added). The Arbitral Tribunal fails to see the direct link between such
“unqualified politival risks” and the non-renewal of the licenses.

In conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the non-renewal or non-
issuance of the Renewed Exploration License, the Cyanide License, the Sarybatyr
License cannot be deemed to have constituted a breach of the protection standards
afforded under Article 2(2) of the BIT, and that the non-renewal of the Mining
License had no causal effect on the damages claimed by Claimant.

(h) As Concerns the Non-Approval of Phase 2 Feasibility Study:

It is undisputed between the Parties that Decree No. 110 required the submission
by Claimant of a Preliminary Feasibility Study as well as a Final Feasibility Study
for Phase 2 in order for Claimant to obtain the right to develop the Project. It is
further undisputed that Claimant prepared and Respondent approved on 5
December 2007 Claimant’s Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility Study (see above
para. 536). It is further undisputed that Respondent never approved Claimant’s
Phase 2 Final Feasibility Study. The disputed question is whether Respondent’s
non-approval of Claimant’s Phase 2 Final Feasibility Study was in breach of the
protection standards of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

In this regard, Claimant’s main contention is that Respondent’s refusal was
inappropriate because it put Claimant in a catch 22 position: In order to provide
detailed information on the financing of Phase 2, Claimant needed the Phase 2
Final Feasibility Study to be approved; however, in order to approve the Phase 2
Final Feasibility Study, Respondent required specific information on the financing

326

terms. Claimant further contends that Respondent chose to apply the requirements
of Decree No. 110 with unnecessary strictness. These requirements put Claimant
in an impossible position and eventually prevented Claimant from obtaining the
necessary financing causing a loss of USD 127,8 million according to Mr.
Haberman’s calculation (Haberman II, para. 4.24). In contrast, Respondent
contends that Claimant’s Phase 2 Feasibility Study largely deviated from the
parameters of its Preliminary Feasibility Study and did not contain key
information regarding financing and sub-contracting, and therefore failed to fulfil
the legal requirements for approval for reasons imputable to Claimant itself.

818. It arises the following out of the evidence at stake:
- Para. 17 (Article III) and para. 18 (Article TV) of Annex 1 of

Decree No. 110 provides as follows with regard to the approval
of the required Final Feasibility Study (Exh. R-236)””:

 

“HII. Order of devel ion of expert ination and app l of

17. On the basis of parameters of the approved PFS (PTEC) of the project,
including limits of financing by types of expenses, initiator of the project in

translation of the wording of the relevant provisions. However, the Arbitral Tribunal did not
consider these differences to be material.

Preliminary Feasibility Study and to contain information about
“sources of financing” as well as “tender documentation for
determination of contractors and suppliers”;

- Claimant does not contest that the Phase 2 Final Feasibility Study
exceeded the Phase 2 Preliminary Feasibility Study by approx.
US$ 100,000, that it did not provide detailed information about
the equipment to be used and purchased, and the specific terms of
financing. Indeed, these elements are duly established by the
factual record (see above paras. 570 fol.). Instead, Claimant
contends that Respondent’s attitude was unfair and unreasonable
because (i) it failed to consider that it also provided significant
advantages to AGF, relating to the additional 750,000 tonnes of
ore that was to be mined, the additional 3.2 tonnes of gold and
0.22 tonnes of silver in the form of finished product that was to
be produced, the additional 662 local jobs that were to be created
and the additional profit of nearly USD 580 million that was to be
made, as well as the USD 443.2 million in taxes and obligatory
payments the Government would be receiving (see Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 965-967), (ii) it applied the
requirements of Decree No. 110 in an unnecessary strict way, and
(iii) it put Claimant in a catch-22 position with regard to
financing.

As mentioned above (see para. 317), the FET standard as contemplated by Article
2(2) must be understood as a means to guarantee justice to foreign investors, and
when doing so, for the States’ actions to give due regard to an investor’s
legitimate expectations by refraining from taking measures which are not justified
under the circumstances, ie. unreasonable, disproportionate or
discriminatory. With regard to the way in which national laws and regulations are
applied, a breach of the standards of protection under Article 2(2) does not occur
just because the relevant laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied in a
different way. Instead, the threshold may only be reached where such laws or
regulations have been applied in a way that is contrary to good faith, fairness or
legitimate expectations by Claimant.

The Arbitral Tribunal finds that this threshold is not met in the present case, in
particular for the following reasons:

- The legal requirements that a Final Feasibility Study be based on
approved parameters of the Preliminary Feasibility Study and
provide specific information concerning costs, equipment and
financing are legitimate;

328

821.

822.

It is undisputed that the Phase 2 Final Feasibility Study deviated
with regard to key parameters from the Preliminary Feasibility
Study, as the scope of the Project had been substantially revised;

A true dialogue took place between AGF and the Uzbek
Government and AGF was aware of what it needed to obtain the
approval of the Phase 2 Final Feasibility Study, but was not in a
position to meet these requirements and therefore disagreed with
the appropriateness of these requirements;

Claimant’s argument concerning the catch-22 problem fails to
convince, given that it is established that RBS refused to finance
the Project long before the issue arose with the approval of the
Final Feasibility Study (see above para. 565) and that Claimant
has failed to establish a causal link between the lack of liceneses
and the Chinese Ministry’s refusal of financing (see above para.
Erreur ! Source du renvoi introuvable.). In addition, whilst
more difficult, it is not impossible to obtain conditional financing
without such approval (See Mr. Larroque’s and Mr. Pingle’s
testimony,Transcripts of 2 May 2014, 1198:7 - 1204:22; 1217:24
- 1224:1; 1290:4 — 17; 1306:14 - 1307:12, 1307:13 - 15;

In 2009, the operational challenges encountered by AGF, the low
amount of dividends paid out to the Uzbek Parties, the problems
with the financial management of AGF leading to non-
compliance with currency and tax laws justified that the Uzbek
government would be more insistent on issues such as terms of
financing.

In summary, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimant’s criticism towards
Respondent’s attitude as concerns the approval of the Phase 2 Final Feasibility
Study failed to reach the threshold necessary for a breach of Article 2(2) of the

As Concerns the Tax Regime Modifications in 2006, 2009 and 2011:

Claimant’s claim of breach of Article 2 of the BIT in relation to the changes in the
Uzbek tax regime has four sub-sets: (i) the revocation of tax privileges granted
under Decrees No. 477, No. 127-20 and No. 266 and stabilization clauses in 2006,
(ii) the non-reimbursement of VAT between 2007 and 2009, (iii) the changes to
the VAT regime modifications in 2009 and (iv) the changes to the VAT regime as
of 2011 (Claim. Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1281 fol.).

329

823. It arises the following out of the evidence at stake:
- AGF benefited of the following tax privileges:

o Decree No. 477 of 22 September 1994 ‘On the creation of the Joint
Venture “Amantaytau Goldfields” and measures to ensure its effective
functioning’ (C-215) provided the following tax privileges to AGF (see
above para. 39):

(i) exemption from paying income tax during five years as of registration
of AGF (i.e. as of 12 December 1994, i.e. until 12 December 1999),

(ii) exemption from paying taxes on customs and property,

(iii) exemption of foreign shareholders and foreign lenders from taxes on
dividends and loan-service payments transferred abroad,

(iv) exemption of taxes or charges on amortisation of fixed assets.

(v) In addition, Clause 7 of Decree No. 477 provided for the following
“stabilization clause” : “In the event of changes during the next ten years
in the tax law of the Republic of Uzbekistan which adversely affect the
activities of the Joint Venture, to provide the application of legal and
other normative acts valid at the time of signing of the statute
documentation for the Joint Venture.” This stabilization clause was to be
valid for 10 years as of signing of the “statute documentation” of AGF,
i.e. as of 24 November 1993 (see above para. 39) and until 24 November
2003...

It is to be noted that to the exception of (iii), all privileges were granted
to the JV, including the tax stabilisation clause which only was
applicable if the change in tax “adversely affect the activities of the Joint
Venture.”

Also, it has to be indicated that in para.6, the taxes which had to paid
were mentioned, among them the “payment for the use of subsoil
(royalties) during the period of exemption from paying income tax, 2,5
percent and after the period of exemption from paying income tax, 6
percent of all revenue receivedby the Joint Venture from the sale of
mineral resources less expenses incurred ...”

330

o Decree No. 127-20 of 30 March 1996 (C-218; see above para. 42)
provided that the tax privileges granted to AGF would “be valid for the
whole mine life period of the joint venture if any concrete timing is not
established.”

o The Law on Foreign Investment of 30 April 1998 provided for the
following stabilization clause:

“If the subsequent legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan makes worse
investment conditions, than legislation current on the date of investment is
applied to foreign investments within ten years of the date of investment. The
foreign investor has the right at his own discretion to apply those provisions
of a new legislation which make better conditions of his investment.

Worsening conditions of investments refer to changes and amendments to the
legislation current on the date of investment or adoption of the new legal acts,
providing:

- increase in the rate of tax on incomes, received as dividends, paid to the
foreign investor; [...]” (Exh, 277, Art. 2)

This stabilization clause provided for a duration of “ten years of the date
of investment”, i.e. as of the establishment of AGF on 22 September or
12 December 1994 until 22 September or 12 December 2004 (depending
on whether one relies on the conclusion of the AGF Original JV
Agreement or the Original AGF Charter, see above para. 37 and 40).

o Decree No. 266 of 11 July 2000 ‘On additional measures to organize the
operation of the Joint Venture “Amantaytau Goldfields” (C-213)
provided in Clause 6 (see above para. 53) that “[a]ll the rights, privileges,
conditions of taxation and guarantees that have been granted to the
project’s participants by the decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of the
Republic of Uzbekistan, which were adopted earlier, shall be reserved”
and with regard to the stabilization clause of Decree No. 477, Clause 7 of
Decree No. 266 provided that “Clause 7 of Decree No. 477 of the
Cabinet of Ministers of Republic of Uzbekistan, dated 22 September
1994, came into effect as of the date of this Decree” and that “a tax for
the use of subsoil will be collected from the JV “Amantaytau Goldfields”
in the amount established by current legislation, i.e. 2.8 per cent of the
amount of the proceeds gained by the joint venture from selling the
extracted precious metals and other associated products.” In other words,
Decree No. 266 had the effect to renew the ten year stabilization clause
of Decree No. 477 until 10 July 2010. I should be noted that the duration
of the exemption of income tax was not extended, which means that in
principle the income tax exemption had lapsed on 12 December 1999. In
fact, the Claimant does not seems to invoke this exemption as a basis for

331

a complaint. Moreover, the next Decree seems to have considered that
the exemption had not lapsed, as will be indicated.

o According to Decree No. 76 of 10 August 2001 ‘On Taxation,
Accounting and Reporting for Amantaytau Goldfields Joint Venture’ (C-
217) (see above para. 414), “[t]he JV shall commence paying income
(profit) tax upon expiry of five years from the moment (date) of
completion of one of the events as follows; - sale of the first lot of the
Product; - State acceptance of the processing plant for the oxide ore to
be mined by open pit methods.” This is also the first legal document
concerning the JV dealing expressly with VAT. According to Clause 15,
“JV shall be exempt from Value Added Tax in respect of imported
materials and equipement, works and services which are used for
construction” during Phase I. At that point in time, AGF was therefore
subject to a “zero rated VAT” regime, meaning that AGF was exempt
from paying VAT on exports and received reimbursement for VAT paid
on import of raw materials or in-country goods or services. In addition,
Decree No. 76 confirmed the stabilization clause’s validity as follows:
“In the event of adverse changes in the tax regime of the Republic of
Uzbekistan, which worsen conditions of JV’s functioning, the legal acts
valid as at I July 2000, including this Regulation, shall remain in force
until 1 July 2010.”

As far as stabilization clauses are concerned, it is the view of the Tribunal
that such a clause in a law or a general regulation does not give a vested
right to the investor, as the State can always modify its laws and general
regulations. The situation is different when a stabilization clause is included
in a contract or a regulation specifically directed at the investor, as in the
present case, where the different Decrees all concerned expressly
Amantaytau Goldfields Joint Venture. The Tribunal will thus considers the
extent of the protection granted by these Decrees to the Joint Venture. In
summary, under these Decrees, AGF was granted three types of relevant tax
privileges: (i) specific privileges in the form of exemptions from specific
taxes, such as the income tax (but not VAT tax) for the duration of the
“whole mine life period”, (ii) a specific stabilization clause under Decree
No. 477 valid until 1 July 2010, as well as (iii) a “zero-rated” treatment for
VAT valid until 1 July 2010.

In 2006, these privileges were revoked as follows:

o By Decree No. 74 of 1 May 2006 ‘On Additional Measures To Increase
An Incentive Role Of Privileges Granted To companies With Foreign
Investments” (C-255) (see above para. 478), all privileges that had been
granted with no specific time limit were “cancelled”. According to

332

Respondent’s interpretation of this provision, this included the privileges
that had been granted by Decree No. 127-20 for the “whole mine life
period.” The main concern of Uzbekistan in adopting this decree was to
improve the efficiency of tax exemptions, as its title indicates and to
limit in time the exemptions granted. In fact, a special group was to be
created in order to review the different exemptions and consider to grant
them again but for limited periods of time. Clauses 3 and 4 provide:

“3. From 1 June 2006 all privileges on paying taxes, customs and
other compulsory paiements earlier granted by Government
resolutions which have not been envisaged by legal documents
and which are without time limit shall be cancelled.

4. In order to secure detailed consideration of issues of necessity
an efficiency of further granting of additional privileges and
preferences to existing companies with foreign investments which
are part of an industry or are implementing projects recognized by
laws as priority projects, a special group shall be created ... and
this group shall be instructed as follows:

All aspects of appeals by individual companies with foreign
investments which were granted additional privileges on paying
taxes, duties, customs and other compulsory paiements without
time limit by earlier Government resolutions shall be considered;

Based on the results of consideration of appeals relevant
substantiated proposals on setting up for individual companies
with foreign investments, which earlier had privileges without
time limit, of substantiated privileges on paying taxes, duties,
customs and other compulsory paiements for a clearly defined
term followed by further conclusion of investment agreements
with foreign investors ...

o Asconcerns Decree No. 133 of 7 July 2006 ‘On Entering of Amendments
and Invalidations of Some Resolutions of the Government of the Republic
of Uzbekistan’ (C-256) (see above para. 479) it cancelled Clauses 5 to 7
of Decree No. 477 and Clauses 6 and 7 of Decree No. 266, thereby
cancelling the stabilization clause.

In summary, Decree No. 74 and Decree No. 133 cancelled all tax privileges

granted to AGF by Decree No. 477, Decree No. 127-20 and Decree No. 266.
They did not however at this stage affect yet AGF’s VAT privileges.

333

- As concerns the VAT treatment, as per 1 January 2009, the changes
introduced to the Uzbek Tax Code changed the zero-rated VAT regime for
import and export applicable to AGF by cancelling the exemption of VAT
tax on imports. In other words, AGF was not able anymore to receive
reimbursement of the VAT paid on import of raw materials. The exemption
of VAT tax on exports of gold and silver however remained in place (see
above paras. 595 fol.). As per 1 January 2011, the remaining favourable
treatment, i.e. the exemption of VAT on export of gold and silver, was
cancelled, thereby subjecting these exports to a standard VAT of 20% (see
above para. 630).

824. Thus, the key question is whether these revocations of privileges and/or changes in
the applicable VAT regime were in breach of the protection standards of Article
2(2) of the BIT. In order to answer this question, the Tribunal starts from the
premise that, whereas a State may modify its tax regime, it must honor
stabilization clauses and the specific privileges that it grants to investors.

825. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that this was partly the case for the following reasons:

- It makes no doubt that Claimant relied on the various tax privileges granted
by Decrees No. 477, No. 127-20 and No. 266 when deciding to become a
shareholder of AGF and that these privileges were relied upon when
calculating the financial needs and revenues of the AGF Project.

- Whilst Respondent contends that these privileges were revoked on justifiable
grounds, namely due to Claimant’s alleged deficient performance, this
argument fails to convince. First, it is not supported by contemporary
documentary evidence. Indeed, none of the documents relating to the
revocation of such privileges established a connection between these
revocations and Claimant’s alleged deficient performance. In this regard, it is
worth noting that none of the legislative acts which provided for the relevant
privileges expressly provided that such privileges could be revoked in case
of non-compliance with legal or contractual requirements. It takes more than
disappointing project performance to justify revoking tax privileges subject
to stabilization clauses, which had been re-confirmed two times.

- Based thereon, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the tax changes
implemented through Decrees 74 and 133 in 2006 breached Claimant’s
legitimate expectations and was contrary to the FET standard under Article
2(2) of the BIT. In this regard, Respondent’s agreement to defer certain tax
payments is not sufficient to repair such breach. It may however be
considered when establishing the impact of such breach (see below paras.
865 fol.).

334

The same applies to the VAT changes implemented in 2009. The Tribunal
must however disagree with Claimant, which complained of violations of
procedural due process, when it stated that “Oxus had neither been consulted
nor had the reasoning behind the VAT change explained to it.” States do not
have an obligation to consult the taxpayers before modifying their fiscal
legislation. The question whether these changes were also discriminatory in
that they applied de facto only to AGF may remain open, given that Claimant
has not established that a double breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT would
impact the amount of damages claimed. On the contrary, the discriminatory
treatment, if any, would be absorbed by the breach of the FET standard. As
to Respondent’s argument that these changes were justified by public policy
grounds requiring to protect the cotton industry rather than the precious
metal industry, it fails to convince. Even if the cotton industry needed special
encouragement measures, Respondent has failed to sufficiently explain why
would this require revoking privileges applying to the export of precious
metals, especially where such privileges were subject to clear stabilization
clauses.

As concerns the VAT changes implemented in 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal
considers that there was no breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT, because these
changes were not covered anymore by the stabilization clause and, moreover,
it appears that Claimant did no pay any taxes in 2011 and was not operating
anymore. Thus, these changes could not have had any impact on Claimant’s
operations.

As concerns the amount of USD 2.7 million claimed by Claimant for alleged
withholding of VAT (see above para. 133, AGF Claim No. 9 (1583.8.7.1.2)),
the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is not sufficiently substantiated.
Whereas Mr. Haberman has included this amount in his various reports and
refers in this respect to “the Uzbek government’s decision not to reimburse
withheld VAT owed to AGF from 2007 onwards” (see e.g. Habermann II,
para. 4.28, Table at para. 4.28), this claim and this amount has been barely
touched upon by Claimant in its legal submissions. In particular, it is not
clear to what extent, if at all, this withholding of VAT is the result of the
2006 tax changes, or whether it is the result of a separate and independent act
of the State. It is further unclear whether AGF has ever initiated
administrative proceedings before the relevant Uzbek authorities requesting
the reimbursement of the claimed VAT reimbursement. Finally, the creditor
of any VAT reimbursement would be AGF as the VAT debtor and not
Claimant itself. The mere fact that Claimant requested that such VAT be
off-set with payments requested by Respondent under the SDA and that such
request was partially rejected, is per se not sufficient to trigger a breach of
Art. 2(2) of the BIT.

(j) | As Concerns the Post-2011 Events, Including the 2011 Audit, the
Criminal Investigations and the Liquidation Proceedings:

As mentioned above in paras. 752-758, regarding Claimant’s claims for
expropriation, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the 2011 Audit, the criminal
investigations and the liquidation proceedings were more of a reaction to an
already catastrophic situation, rather than the cause of such situation. As such, for
the same reasons as mentioned above and even though the way in which the 2011
Audit, the criminal investigations and the liquidation proceedings were conducted
may not be immune to criticism, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that there is no breach
of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

2.3.1.3 Conclusion

The Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent shall be liable for a breach of Article
2(2) of the BIT in connection with the tax regime changes implemented in 2006
and in 2009.

As concerns all other Claimant’s claims for breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT, they
are rejected.

With Regard to the FPS

2.3.2.1 The Parties’ Positions

(a) Claimant’s Position

According to Claimant, Respondent and its organs, through their various acts and
omissions, breached Respondent’s obligation to provide Claimant’s investment
with full protection and security, in breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT for the
following reasons (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1310 fol.; Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, paras. 22, 31, 182; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 118):

(i) Relying on Occidental v. Ecuador, Claimant contends that treatment that
is not fair and equitable automatically entails an absence of full
protection and security. Employment of physical force would not be a
condition for the application of this standard.

(ii) Thus, all of Uzbekistan’s acts and omissions (summarized above in para.
684) constitute a breach of the FPS standard to the extent that they also
constitute a breach of the FET standard. This would in particular be the
case for Respondent’s omissions with regard to the 2006, 2009 and 2011

336

830.

831.

832.

changes in the tax regime, the liquidation proceedings and the criminal
investigations.

(iii) Even if the Arbitral Tribunal found that a breach of the FET standard did
not entail an automatic finding of breach of FPS, each of Respondent’s
acts and omissions that constitute a breach of the FET standard, would
also constitute individually, let alone collectively, a separate breach of
the FPS standard. This is because instead of taking all measures and
exercising reasonable care so as to protect Claimant’s investment from
injury by private or public action, Respondent and its organs took all
measures available to them to deprive Claimant of its investment.

(b) Respondent's Position

According to Respondent, there is no dispute between the Parties that the FPS
standard is one of due diligence. However, the FPS standard is not co-terminous
with the FET standard and concerns primarily the host State’s obligation to
exercise reasonable care in protecting the investment from the actions of third
parties, and applies essentially “when the foreign investment has been affected by
civil strife and physical violence.” (Saluka v. Czech Republic, para. 483, RL-291).
Even where tribunals have extended this standard beyond physical security, the
standard is limited and is met when the State “provides adequate mechanisms and
legal remedies for prosecuting the State organs or private parties responsible for
the injury caused to the investor.” (AWG v. Argentina, para. 173) (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 922).

Claimant’s position is based on the theory that a breach of the FET standard
automatically entails an absence of full protection and security. This is incorrect.
As such, Claimant has failed to establish a violation of the FPS standard, because
Claimant has not alleged that Respondent failed to exercise due diligence to
protect its investment against any interference by a third party, and thus has not
even articulated a claim under the standard. In fact, most of the alleged actions or
omissions about which Claimant complains were not taken by a third party;
rather, they were taken directly by the State itself. Further, Claimant has also not
alleged that Respondent failed to provide a legal framework enabling Claimant to
take effective steps to protect its investment. (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras.
922 fol.).

As concerns Claimant’s argument that the actions of AGF’s liquidation managers,
even if not attributable to Respondent, violated the FPS standard, it is unfounded
as the FPS standard is meant “to protect more specifically the physical integrity of
an investment against interference by use of force.” (Saluka v. Czech Republic,

337

833.

834.

835.

836.

837.

838.

para. 484, RL-291). However, there are no allegations of any interference by use
of force against Claimant’s investment.

Consequently, Claimant’s full protection and security claims are unsubstantiated
and without merit.

2.3.2.2. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

As already determined above, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the FET
standard and the FPS standard are not co-terminous but apply in a different
context. The “obligation of vigilance and due diligence” of the FPS standard is
not of the same nature and scope as the obligations arising out of the FET
standard: Under the FPS standard, an investor may not expect a State to ensure
that the investor be treated “fairly and equitably” by any third party, but instead
the investor has the right to expect that the State takes reasonable measures within
its power to prevent wrongful injuries by third parties, and where such injuries
have already happened, to punish them. This is why the FPS standard is often
referred to and applied in the context of “use of force” (see above para. 353 ; e.g.
Saluka v. Czech Republic, para. 483; Asian Agricultural Products Ltd (AAPL) v.
Sri Lanka, para. 26 A; Wena Hotels v. Egypt, para. 84; Eastern Sugar v. Czech
Republic, para. 203; see also Enron v. Argentina, para. 286 and Sempra v.
Argentina, para. 323).

Within the context of the AGF Project, the facts underlying Claimant’s claims are
mainly the changes in the tax regimes, the criminal investigations and the
liquidation procedure (see above para. 829(ii)).

To the extent that these facts relate to actions or omissions of the Uzbek
Government organs, claims based thereon fall outside the scope of the FPS
standard. Thus, as concerns the AGF Project, the only element which enters into
consideration is the liquidation process, as changes in the tax regime are designed
and implemented by the Government and actions of a criminal prosecutor are also
to be considered actions of the Government.

The question is thus whether the way in which the liquidation process was
conducted amounts to a breach of the FPS standard.

It should at first be noted that Claimant does not raise any independent claim with
regard to the liquidation process, although it does complain about the non-return
of the drill rig and requests in this regard an amount of USD 2,562,599.99.
Moreover, the Tribunal has already ruled that the liquidation process developed
after Claimant’s departure from Uzbekistan and closing of the mine and could not
therefore affect its rights. However, for the sake of exhaustivity, the Tribunal will

338

examine the theoretical question of the merits of the claims relating to the
liquidation process. It must however be underlined that Claimant has not
articulated its claim in a very clear manner:

(i) In its Reply, Claimant argues that it is Respondent which “prompts and
drives the AGF liquidation” (paras. 1214 fol.). In its Post-Hearing Brief,
Claimant further contends that the actions of the Uzbek Parties and the
liquidators are all imputable to Respondent (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014,
paras. 173 fol.). However, to the extent that Claimant takes issue with
omissions and actions of Respondent itself, such actions and omissions are
covered by the FET standard and are thus irrelevant for the purpose of
examining a breach of the FPS standard.

(ii) In its Post-Hearing Brief, upon being invited by the Arbitral Tribunal to
further substantiate the specific irregularities allegedly affecting the
liquidation process and their specific impact on Claimant’s alleged
damages (see above para. 117), Claimant responded stating that “Claimant
[...] addresses this question regarding the AGF liquidation procedure out
of its desire to respond fully to the Tribunal’s questions. However
Claimant emphasises that in order to succeed on the merits of its claims,
its case does not depend in any way upon Respondent's pathological
failings in respect of the AGF liquidation procedure.” (Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 148).

839. As such, it is unclear to what extent Claimant actually still relies on the

840.

841.

liquidation process as a factual basis for its claims. In addition, the way in which
Claimant has put its claim for breach of FPS standard is not in line with the
principle that such standard may only apply with regard to actions of third parties.
To the extent that Claimant’s claim is based on the premise that all the relevant
actions and omissions by the Uzbek Parties and/or liquidators are “imputable to
Respondent”, they do not qualify as actions of third parties and thus fall beyond
the scope of the FPS standard.

As concerns Claimant’s claim over the drill rig, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that for
the same reasons as mentioned above in connection with Article 5 of the BIT
(para. 755), the way in which the liquidator dealt with the drill rig do also not
amount to a breach of the FPS standard. The same applies to Claimant’s silver
refinery (see above para. 804).

As such, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimant has failed to sufficiently
substantiate its claim for breach of the FPS standard.

339

2.3.2.3 Conclusion

842. In conclusion, Claimant’s claims for breach of the FPS standard are rejected.

2.3.3

With Regard to the Umbrella Clause

2.3.3.1 The Parties’ Positions

(a)

Claimant's Position

843. According to Claimant, through its acts and omissions and those of its organs
and/or of the Uzbek Parties, Respondent breached its duty to honor its specifc
obligations towards Claimant under the umbrella clause as set out in Article 2(2)
BIT in fine (see above para. 312) leading to the declaration of force majeure and
Claimant’s forced departure and the loss of its investments (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, para. 1314). In support of this contention, Claimant relies mainly on
the following facts and arguments:

0)

(ii)

(iii)

By forcing Claimant to issue the Guarantee Letters (see above paras. 451
and 461) and conclude the Special Dividend Agreement (see above para.
466), Respondent breached Claimant’s right to export and sell gold and
silver as granted, among others, under Decree No. 477 (see above para.
39) and the Government’s letter of 23 Aug 2002 (see above para. 424)
(Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1314 a).

By revoking AGF’s tax privileges, via Decrees No. 74 and 133 in May and
July 2006 respectively (see above para. 478 and 479), and modifying the
VAT regime in 2009 and 2011 (see above paras. 589 fol. And 640 fol.),
Respondent breached its obligations under the stabilization clause granted
under Article 7 of Decree No. 477 (see above para. 39), as extended by
Article 7 of Decree No. 266 (see above para. 53) and restated by Article 34
of Regulation No. 76 (see above para. 414) (Claim. Am.Reply.
23.08.2013, para. 1314 b).

By refusing to issue and/or renew AGF’s licenses, Respondent, through
the Uzbek Parties, breached Art. 8 of Decree No. 266 (see above para. 53),
section 7.2 of the Revised AGF Charter (1) (see above para. 52) and
Article 1.1 of the AGF Services Agreement (see above para. 422) (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1314 c; Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 346
and 347).

340

(iv)

By refusing to assist with the signing of a Foreign Investment Agreement
requested by CITIC (see above para. 605), Respondent’s organs, NUMC
and Goskomgeology breached their obligations under Recital G of the
Joint Venture Agreement (see above para. 37), namely to assist AGF to
procure the loan financing required for its mining activities (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1314 c; Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras. 392-
398).

844. Each of the above breaches by Uzbekistan of its undertaking had direct financial
consequences quantified by Mr. Haberman (see ER-Haberman I, para. 4.75).
They also bear the consequences of the overall failure to secure financing,
including initially with RBS and Nedbank as well as later with CITIC (Claim.
Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1316).

845.

(b)

Respondent's Position

According to Respondent, Claimant’s claims for breach of the umbrella clause do
not meet the necessary threshold for three main reasons (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 927 fol.):

0)

(ii)

(iii)

The specific obligations Claimant refers to in Decrees No. 477 and 266
exist towards AGF and not towards Claimant, and there is thus no
undertaking to be honoured by the Republic with respect to Claimant in
those Decrees. In addition, the umbrella clause does not transform ipso
iure municipal law obligations into treaty obligations, but rather prohibits
the use of sovereign authority by the State to abrogate or otherwise
interfere with contractual and other vested rights;

Claimant cannot sustain umbrella clause claims for any alleged breach of
AGF’s Charter or Joint Venture Agreement, as any alleged obligation
contained therein was owed by Goskomgeology or NGMK to AGF, and
not to Claimant. In addition, the alleged breaches of AGF’s Charter and JV
Agreement are mere contractual obligations, and thus cannot constitute
violation of the umbrella clause. In this regard, Claimant fails to allege or
demonstrate that the alleged breaches of AGF’s Charter and Joint Venture
Agreement were the result of any exercise of sovereign authority. Thus,
they cannot constitute a violation of the umbrella clause;

In addition, NGMK is not a State organ, but a private party and thus its
obligations cannot count as specific obligations of the State.

In any event, Respondent did 342ulfil its obligations under the relevant
agreements and laws, in particular Decree No. 477, No. 266, the AGF Charter and
the AGF JV Agreement (see Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, section V).

2.3.3.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

(a) The Applicable Legal Basis (Reminder)

Article 2(2) in fine of the BIT provides as follows:

“(2) [...] Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have
entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the
other Contracting Party.”

As mentioned in the context of the Khandiza Project (see above para. 364 fol.),
for a claim to be based on an umbrella clause the claimant must establish, among
others, that (i) the obligation which is alleged to be breached must exist., and (ii)
the obligation at stake must have been entered into by the State or one of its
organs towards the claimant specifically, i.e. not just by was of a general law and
not just towards an affiliate or subsidiary of the claimant (privity requirement).

(b) The Relevancy of the Umbrella Clause in the Present Case

In order to decide on Claimant’s claims, it is thus necessary to determine whether
the Uzbek State has entered into obligations towards Claimant specifically, which
it later on breached.

As concerns Claimant’s reliance on the Guarantee Letters and the Special
Dividend Agreement, to the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal ruled that the
conclusion of these undertakings by Oxus did not breach the FET standard,
Claimant has not sufficiently established to what extent these undertakings could —
even if considered in breach of some of Respondent’s obligations towards
Claimant — breach the threshold required to transform a breach of national law or
of a contractual undertaking under such law into a breach of the BIT.

As concerns Claimant’s claim based on an alleged breach of its right to export
gold and silver under Decree No. 477 and the Government’s letter of 23 August

2002, it should be noted that:

- Decree No. 477 grants rights to the Joint Venture, i.e. to AGF, and not to
Claimant. As such, the privity requirement is not met.

342

852.

853.

- The same applies to the Government’s letter of 23 August 2002 to the
extent that it refers to Decree No. 477. As concerns the reference to
paragraph 4 of Article 12 of the Law on Foreign Investments, this
paragraph provides as follows: “the enterprises with foreign investments
on their own account execute export-import operations observing the
demands of the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Export of
indigenously produced output is not liable to licensing and allocation.”
However, as mentioned above, obligations contained in Law on Foreign
Investments are general obligations not specifically entered into with
Claimant. As such, they may not trigger Respondent’s liability under the
umbrella clause. In any event, the terms “enterprises with foreign
investments” used in the Law and the terms “enterprises with foreign
capital’ used in the Government’s letter refer to the local entity, i.e. AGF,
and not to the foreign investor itself. As such, the privity requirement is
also not met.

As concerns Claimant’s claim regarding the revocation of tax privileges arising
out of Decrees No. 266 and 477, all of the tax privileges granted thereunder are
granted to AGF and not to Claimant. As such, the privity requirement is again not
met. In addition, to the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal has ruled that certain
modifications of the tax regime were in breach of the FET standard, this breach
already consumes a potential breach under the umbrella clause and Claimant has
not established to what extent a “double” breach would have a different impact on
its claim for damages.

As concerns Claimant’s claim for refusal to issue or renew relevant licenses, the
relevant provisions Claimant relies on provide as follows:

- Article 8 of Decree No. 266 provides that “[t]he State Committee for
Geology of the Republic of Uzbekistan shall issue to the JV “Amantaytau
Goldfields”, in a prescribed manner, a licence for the subsoil use granting
the rights to carry out the exploration works and mining operations within
the project area”;

- The relevant part of Section 7.2 of the Revised AGF Charter, which is
concluded between the shareholders of AGF, i.e. ORC, Goskomgeology
and NMMC, provides that “[t]he Shareholders shall have the following
obligations: [...]€ [...] as long as the Company exists, to use their best
endeavours to ensure that all appropriate rights, licences and permits to
explore and develop the Gold Deposits and the Project Territory are
obtained on a-timely basis”;

343

854.

855.

- Article 1.1 of the AGF Services Agreement, which is concluded between
Goskomgeology and AGF, provides that

“AGF shall instruct and Goskomgeology shall undertake rendering the
following services to AGF: [...]

-  providii ltations and assi. in ction with obtaining of
all necessary permits, consents and approvals which require to carry
out AGF’s activities, including, without limitation, [...] licenses to use

sub-soil and other types of licenses, [...]

- rendering assistance in extending terms of licenses and property rights;

J”

It is clear from the wording and purpose of the relevant documents, that the
obligations provided for in Decree No. 266 are obligations of Goskomgeology
(acting here as State organ in charge of issuing licenses) towards the Joint
Venture, i.e. AGF, and not towards Claimant itself. As for the AGF Services
Agreement, it establishes an obligation of Goskomgeolgoy (acting here as private
commercial partner, and not as State organ) towards AGF, and not towards
Claimant. As such, these documents may not be used to establish a breach of the
umbrella clause, failing to meet the privity requirement.

The only instrument which could provide for an obligation towards Claimant
itself is the Revised AGF Charter, which was signed between ORC,
Goskomgeology and NMMC. However, there are three hurdles which Claimant
has failed to overcome:

(i) First, Claimant has not established to what extent Goskomgeology is
acting as a “State organ” in the performance of the Revised AGF Charter;

(ii) Second, even if Goskomgeology could be considered as a State organ, the
obligation stipulated in Section 7.2 is an obligation of “best endeavours”,
i.e. an “obligation de moyens” and not an “obligation de résultat”. In this
regard, while it is undisputed that certain licenses were not renewed, the
record shows that Goskomgeology did undertake certain action to support
Claimant’s requests for renewal (see above para. 571 fol.). Claimant does
not explain to what extent these actions were not sufficient and what
further action Goskomgeology should have taken;

(iii) | Third, the specific obligation of best endeavours of Goskomgeology to
ensure the obtention of necessary permits and licenses refers logically to
permits and licenses to be held by AGF for its operations, and not by
Claimant.

344

856.

857.

858.

859.

860.

2.3.4

861.

Finally, to the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal ruled that the non-renewal or non-
issuance of certain licenses did not breach the general protection standards of
Article 2(2) BIT (see above para. 815), it is difficult to see how it could breach the
umbrella clause..

As concerns Claimant’s claim for failure by the Uzbek Parties to assist in the
conclusion of the Foreign Investment Agreement requested by CITIC, Claimant
relies on a breach of Recital G of the AGF Original JV Agreement which provides
that “[t]he Parties now wish to establish the JV Enterprise and following any
decision to exploit the Gold Deposits, to assist the JV Enterprise to procure the
loan finance required for its mining activities and also to provide to the JV
Enterprise such management, technical and other services as it may require.”

 

As mentioned with regard to the Revised AGF Charter, Claimant has not
established to what extent the Uzbek Parties are acting as “State organ” in the
performance of the AGF Original JV Agreement and/or the Revised AGF Charter.
In addition, Recital G of the AGF Original JV Agreement is drafted in very broad
terms and refer to assisting the “JV Enterprise”, ic. AGF, with assistance, not
Claimant itself. Consequently, Claimant has failed to establish that this provision
confers to Claimant the right it claims and fulfils the privity requirement.

In summary, Claimant’s claims for breach of the umbrella clause fail either for not
fulfilling the necessary requirements, or for the reason that they are subsumed
under the claims for breach of the FET standard.

2.3.3.3 Conclusion

In conclusion, Claimant’s claims for breach of the umbrella clause are rejected.

Conclusion Concerning Breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT

In conclusion, as concerns the various claims raised by Claimant listed above in
para. 133 above and which the Arbitral Tribunal has numbered AGF Claims No. 1
to 16, the Arbitral Tribunal finds as follows:

- Claimant’s AGF Claims No. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 (see above, para. 133,
pp. 63-64) are rejected in full.

- Claimant’s AGF Claim No. 9 is rejected as concerns sub-claims

1583.8.7.1.4, 1583.8.7.1.5, 1583.8.7.1.6, 1583.8.7.1.7 (see above, para.
133, p. 62).

345

- As concerns Claimant’s AGF Claim No. 8 (see above, para. 133, p. 61)
and No. 9 sub-claims 1583.8.7.1.1 to 1583.8.7.1.3 (see above, para. 133,
pp. 61-62), they are granted to the extent specified below in section 0.

2.4 Issue No 4: Was There a Breach of MFN Clause ?

862. In its Post-Hearing Brief I, Claimant for the first time alleges a breach by
Respondent “of a number of BITs ratified by Uzbekistan and applicable through
the MEN clause of the Uzbek-UK BIT, to issue all the licenses necessary for the
development of the Deposit, as this is required for the use and enjoyment of the
right granted and moreover otherwise unfair and inequitable.” (see Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 109; see also Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, footnote 24 and para.
64).

863. As a preliminary remark, it is doubtful whether such claim of breach of the MFN
clause is admissible at this late stage of the proceedings, though this question may
however remain open. Indeed, as established above, the Arbitral Tribunal ruled
that the non-issuance or non-renewal of certain licenses did not constitute an
expropriation under Article 5 of the BIT (see above para. Xx) and was further not
in breach of the protection standards afforded under Article 2(2) of the BIT (see
above para. 815). In this regard, Claimant has in any event failed to establish to
what extent the standard afforded under “a number of BITs” is stricter than the
standards afforded under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

864. In conclusion, Claimant’s claim for breach of the MFN clause shall be rejected.

2.5 Issue No. 5: What is the Appropriate Measure of Damages to be
Afforded to Claimant?

2.5.1 Damages for Breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT

2.5.1.1 Claimant’s Claimed Amount

865. To the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal has admitted a breach of Article 2(2) of
the BIT with regard to the changes in the tax regime of 2006 and 2009, the
question arises what compensation, if any, Claimant should be granted. In this
respect, the following section will only address the amount of damages regarding
the aforementioned breach.

346

866. Claimant claims the following amounts:

(i) As concerns the tax changes in 2006, Claimant claims an
amount of USD 14,1 million as at 30 June 2012, and USD
13,3 million as at 18 March 2011 (see Claimant’s AGF
Claim No. 9, sub-claim 1583.8.7.1.1 and 1583.8.7.1.2 ; see
above para. 133(i) and Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 44;
ER-Haberman II (12.08.2013), para. 6.5).

(ii) As concerns the VAT changes in 2009, Claimant claims an
amount of USD 39 million as at 30 June 2012, and USD
35,5 million as at 18 March 2011 (see Claimant’s AGF
Claim No. 9, sub-claim 1583.8.7.1.3 ; see above para. 133
ii) ; see further Claim. Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1029 fol.;
paras. 1317 fol.; Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 28 fol. ;
Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, paras. 109 fol. ; ER-Haberman
II (12.08.2013), paras. 6.6 and 6.7).

2.5.1.2 The Parties’ Positions

(a) Claimant’s Position

867. According to Claimant, the changes to the tax regime applicable to AGF have had
three different impacts on Claimant (See Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 41):

- The higher taxes caused monetary losses to AGF;

- The cash flow of the JV was impaired as it had to divert funds that would
have been used for different purposes such as the costs of running the
business or the meeting of liabilities; and

- The perception of AGF as a safe investment was adversely impacted. In
fact, these acts gave the impression that the Government neither supported
AGF nor Claimant, or any other foreign investors. Moreover, there were
“aggravating circumstances” as Respondent knew that Claimant was a
junior mining company and was even warned that this situation could
adversely contribute to Claimant’s ability to secure financing.

868. Claimant bases its damage claim mainly on the two expert reports of Mr.
Haberman (ER- Haberman I (17.08.2012) and ER-Haberman II (12.08.2013)).

347

869

870.

871.

872.

873.

. According to Claimant, Mr. Haberman’s quantification of the damages caused by
Respondent to Claimant is “very conservative” since it is only based on the
revocation of AGF’s profit tax exemption (See Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014,
para. 44).

According to Mr. Haberman, the losses suffered by Claimant as a result of the tax
changes are as follows:

(i) USD 14,1 million as at 30 June 2012, and USD 13,3 million as at 18 March
2011 with regard to the tax changes 2006 (See Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014,
para. 108; ER-Haberman II (12.08.2013), para. 6.5);

(ii) USD 39 million as at 30 June 2012, and USD 35,5 million at as 18 March
2011 with regard to the VAT changes in 2009 (See Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 71 ; Claim. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 111 ; ER-Haberman
TI (12.08.2013), paras. 6.5 and 6.6 and 4. 29)

Mr. Habermann further concludes to a cumulative adverse impact on AGF’s cash
flow amounting to USD 25,5 million from 2007 to 2011 (See Claim. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 72; ER-Haberman II (12.08.2013), para. 6.6).

Mr. Haberman’s figures derive from the following main calculations and
assumptions:

In his first expert report of 17 August 2012, Mr. Haberman carried out a series of
separate calculations in order to explain the impact of each and every action of
Respondent on Claimant, which he classified into ten separate actions (see ER-
Haberman I (17.08.2012), para. 4.75) including the 2006 tax changes as ‘Action
2’ and the 2009 VAT changes as ‘Action 6’.

- As concerns Action 2, i.e. the impact on Claimant of the 2006 tax changes
for the period 2006 to 2010 (i.e. when the relevant privileges would have
expired), Mr. Haberman’s figure of USD 14.1 million corresponds to his
estimated loss (based on a DCF valuation) of the value for AGF of the
oxide and sulphide deposits of USD 4 and 10.1 million respectively as at
30 June 2012 (See Haberman I, para. 4.129, p. 57). As at 18 March 2011,
the loss is estimated at USD 13,4, which consists of USD 4,1 million for
the oxide deposits and USD 9,3 million for the sulphide deposits (see ER-
Haberman I (17.08.2012) para. 4.129, p. 58).

- As concerns Action 6, i.e. the impact on Claimant of the 2009 VAT
changes (for an indefinite period moving forward), Mr. Haberman’s figure
of USD 39 million corresponds to his estimated loss (based on a DCF

348

valuation) of the value for AGF of the oxide and sulphide deposits of USD
13,6 million and USD 25,4 million respectively as at 30 June 2012 (see
ER-Haberman I (17.08.2012), para. 4.129, p. 57). As at 18 March 2011,
the loss is estimated at USD 35,5 million consisting of USD 13,1 million
for the oxide deposits and USD 22,4 million for the sulphide deposits (see
ER-Haberman I (17.08.2012), para. 4.129, p. 58).

874. In his second expert report of 12 August 2013, Mr. Haberman amended some of
his calculations of the loss of value for Claimant of its AGF investments based on
some additional information and instructions and provided additional explanations
to his calculations (See ER-Haberman II (12.08.2013), para. 6.4). The calculations
of these losses are set out in Appendix C to his second report (See ER-Haberman
II (12.08.2013), para. 6.5).

- As concerns Action 2, i.e. the impact of the 2006 tax changes, Mr.
Haberman explains that he bases his calculations on an alleged “worst case
scenario” where all the tax exemptions would have expired on | July 2010
(see Haberman II, para. 4.18 and 4. 27). Decrees No. 74 and 133 revoked
AGF’s tax privileges in May and July 2006 and thus “significantly
increased AGF’s tax burden for the rest of 2006 and for each subsequent
year of the project, thereby reducing its profits and the value that could be
ascribed to Oxus Gold’s 50% interest in AGF.” In other words, Mr.
Haberman’s approach is that such reduction in profits and value of AGF
affected Claimant’s 50% interest in AGF (See Haberman II, para. 4.27).
Mr. Haberman estimated that the reduction in Claimant’s cash flow
amounts to USD 8 million as the following table shows (see ER-Haberman
II (12.08.2013), Table p. 39, para. 4.27):

 

[2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010] 2011 | Total
0

Cash flow reduction from Action2 | 2.2 | 4.7 [03 [| o8 | -

- As concerns Action 6, Mr. Haberman relies on the assumptions that the
amendments to the Uzbek Tax Code in January 2009 “meant that AGF
was not longer able to recover the VAT it paid on local purchases in
Uzbekistan” and “this significantly increased AGF’s capital and operation
costs as they were now subject to VAT.” Mr. Haberman assumed that this
affected AGF’s costs from 1 January 2009 onwards (up to 2011).
According to Mr. Haberman this action resulted in a reduction of cash flow
for Claimant of USD 25,5 million as the following table shows (see ER-
Haberman II (12.08.2013), Table p. 40, para. 4.29):

 

[2007 | 2008 [| 2009 [| 2010 [ 2011 | Total

879.

In paras. 6.5 and 6.6 of Mr. Haberman’s second report, Mr. Haberman
summarizes his position distinguishing between what he considers a “loss suffered
by Oxus Gold on its AGF investment” and “the impact of the individual actions of
the Uzbek Government [...] on Oxus Gold’s interest in AGF.” As concerns the
loss, Mr. Haberman arrives at the figures listed above of USD 14.1 million (per 30
June 2012) and 13.3 million (per 18 March 2011) for Action 2 and USD 39
million (per 30 June 2012) and 35.5 million (per 18 March 2011) for Action 6. As
concerns the cash flow impact, Mr. Haberman arrives at the figures listed above
of USD 8 million for Action 2 and USD 25.5 million for Action 6. With regard to
the cash flow impact, Mr. Haberman explains that he considered the cash flow
impact because “several of the Uzbek government’s actions, such as the
production delay, did not have much effect on my valuation of Oxus Gold’s loss
but significantly reduced AGF and Oxus Gold’s cash positions prior to the
alleged expropriation” and therefore calculated the total and cumulative effect o
these actions on the cash flow (see ER-Haberman II (12.08.2013), para. 6.5 and
6.6, p. 47-48). The supporting calculations for Mr. Haberman’s figures are
included in Appendix C to his report.

In summary, Claimant claims for the loss of value to its investment as calculated
by Mr. Haberman at USD 14,1 million as at 30 June 2012 or USD 13,3 million as
at 18 March 2011 for the 2006 tax changes and USD 39 million as at 30 June
2012 or USD 35,5 million as at 18 March 2011 for the 2009 VAT changes.
Claimant’s requests for relief do not include a claim for payment of the cash flow
impact calculated by Mr. Haberman.

(b) Respondent's Position

Respondent rejects Claimant’s claims regarding the tax changes in 2006 and the
VAT changes in 2009.

Respondent challenges both Mr. Haberman’s approach, as well as his
calculations, which Respondent considers “erroneous” and leading to amounts
“grossly overstated” (See Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 144).

According to Respondent, instead of proceeding with a DCF valuation as done by
Mr. Haberman, Claimant’s damages should be calculated by comparing the
amounts that AGF actually paid with those it legitimately expected to pay based
on the tax rates provided in the Feasibility Study 2003 (Resp. PHB I, para. 146;
Resp PHB II, para. 60).

350

880. This is the approach adopted by Respondent’s expert, Mr. Hart, in his three expert
reports (see ER-Hart I (15.02.2013); ER-Hart II (20.02.2014); ER-Hart III
(10.07.2014)). According to Mr. Hart, the net impact of the relevant tax law
changes amount to USD 10,299,572 million (see Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para.
144 ; Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 60 ; Hart III, para. 39).

881.

In addition, Mr. Hart voices the following main criticisms towards Mr.

Haberman’s analysis:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

Mr. Haberman’s calculations include both phases of the AGF Project.
However, according to Mr. Hart there is no basis for a damage claim relating
to Phase II as Claimant was never allowed to implement said Phase in the
first place. In addition, AGF never paid any taxes for Phase II as it never
started (see Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 145 ; Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014,
para. 60 ; ER-Hart IT (20.02.2014), para. 234).

As concerns Phase I, Mr. Hart disagrees with the use of Haberman’s own
DCF models for valuation of the oxide ores. Mr. Hart alleges that these
calculations are “fictitious” since they are not based on the amount of ore
AGF actually mined, but on the mining operations which would have
occurred. Consequently, they do not show if the taxes paid by AGF actually
increased or not (see Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 145; ER-Hart I
(15.02.2013), para. 288; ER-Hart III (10.07.2014), para. 35).

As concerns Phase I, Mr. Hart further purports that Mr. Haberman’s damage
calculation is erroneous since it relies on the incorrect assumption that AGF
actually paid USD 53.1 million in taxes (see Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013,
paras. 700 f.). However, according to Mr. Hart, this figure is unsupported.

In contrast, Mr. Hart proceeded as follows:

e Based on Claimant’s own information, including Mr. Haberman’s
Exhibit 16 as well as Oxus Gold 2011 Annual Report and Accounts
(Exh. R-508), the actual amount of taxes paid for the years 2004 to
2010 for Phase 1 is USD 38,167,000 (including non-income taxes of
USD 30,412 million, custom duties of USD 4,543 million and profit
taxes of USD 3,212 million), with no taxes being paid in 2011.

e The 2003 Feasibility Study forecasted taxes in an amount of USD 13,927
million for Phase | based on expected revenue of USD 222,341 million.
Considering that Phase 1 actually generated USD 315,977 milion in
revenue, applying the tax rates provided for in the 2003 Feasibility

351

882.

883.

884.

885.

Study, the amount of expected taxes should have been USD
17,567,856.

e Thus, the impact of the tax changes should be determined based on the
difference between the amount of expected taxes (USD 17,567,856) and
the amount of taxes effectively paid (USD 38,167,000), ie. USD
20,599,144 (See Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 145 fol. ; Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, para. 60 ; ER-Hart IIT (10.07.2014), paras. 35 to 40).

e Oxus’ share of this amount is 50%, i.e. USD 10,299,572.

In summary, as concerns the tax law amendments, Respondent rejects Claimant’s
claims and purports that, if the Arbitral Tribunal was to award a compensation for
damages, the correct amount should be no more than USD 10,299,572
corresponding to Oxus’ share of the difference between taxes expected under the
2003 Feasibility Study and taxes effectively paid by AGF.

2.5.1.3 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

As a first step, the Arbitral Tribunal must decide which of the two experts’
approach is more appropriate to reflect the damage suffered by Claimant as a
result of the tax changes implemented in violation of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Haberman’s
approach. First of all, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondent, that a DCF
approach is not a well suited method to assess damages where the only Treaty
breach retained by the Arbitral Tribunal concerns taxes. Secondly, the Arbitral
Tribunal shares Mr. Hart’s view that the various figures relied upon by Mr.
Haberman are largely hypothetical and fail to take into account what actually
happened (see ER-Hart II (10.07.2014), para. 35 and ER-Hart II (20.02.2014),
para. 43). In view of the Arbitral Tribunal’s ruling that the only Treaty breach
committed by Respondent is the undue revocation of various tax privileges
granted to Claimant, the damage that Claimant suffers out of such breach consists
in additional costs, in casu additional taxes. Thus, whilst relying on a DCF
evaluation may have been appropriate in case of an expropriation in order to
assess the total value of the expropriated investment, such method is not well
suited in the present case because it does not account for the specific nature of the
damage caused.

As such, the Arbitral Tribunal finds Mr. Haberman’s approach generally
unhelpful and instead largely agrees with the approach adopted by Mr. Hart, i.e.
that the claimable damage consists in Claimant’s share of the difference between
the taxes actually paid by AGF and the taxes that AGF could legitimately expect

352

to pay when making its investment. This is the reason why the Arbitral Tribunal
rejected by letter of 27 October 2015 (see above para. 122) Respondent’s request
to comment on the updated calculations of Mr. Haberman as contained in
Annexes 4 and 5 to Claimant’s Updated Prayer for Relief II of 6 June 2014.
Indeed, since the Arbitral Tribunal will disregard Mr. Haberman’s general
approach, there is no need for Respondent to further comment on specific
calculations of Mr. Haberman.

886. As laid out above (para. 881(iv)), Mr. Hart proceeded as follows:

- As concerns Phase | of the AGF Project, Mr. Hart relies on the tax rates
provided in the Amended Phase | Feasibility Study (see above para. 427,
R-289/C-527) to determine the tax rates that AGF could have legitimately
expected to pay for Phase 1. He then applies such rates to the actual
revenue for Phase | of USD 315,977 million contained in Mr. Haberman’s
Exhibit 16, and arrives at a total forecasted taxes of USD 17,567,856. He
then compares this amount to the actual amount of taxes paid of USD
38,167,000, which he derives from Mr. Haberman’s Exhibit No. 16
(adding up the amounts of 30,412 for taxes other then income taxes, 4,543
for customs duty on BCM equipment and 3,212 of profit taxes, see Table 1
in ER-Hart III, para. 36). The difference is USD 20,599,144, which Mr.
Hart then divides by two to account for Claimant’s 50% shareholding in
AGEF and thus arrives at a total additional tax amount of USD 10,299,572
for Phase 1;

- As concerns Phase 2, Mr. Hart contends that no taxes were paid in 2011
and that there is thus no damage for 2011.

887. To the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal generally agrees with Mr. Hart’s approach,
the remaining question therefore is whether the tax rates and revenue figures
relied upon by Mr. Hart are reasonable, or whether there are justified reasons to
deviate from Mr. Hart’s underlying figures:

- As concerns Phase 1, the Arbitral Tribunal considers it appropriate to rely
on the tax regime on which the Amended Phase | Feasibility Study was
based (see R-289_108-109). It further notes that as concerns the actual
revenue generated by AGF from 2004 to 2010, i.e. USD 31,977 million
and the total amount of taxes paid during this period, i.e. USD 38,167,000,
Mr. Hart relies on amounts contained in Mr. Haberman’s own Exhibit No.
16. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Mr. Hart’s calculations
are sufficiently reliable and sees no reason to deviate therefrom.
Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the damage caused to
Claimant by Respondent’s violation of Article 2(2) of the BIT with regard

353

to changes of the 2006 and 2009 tax regime amount to USD 10,299,572
for Phase 1.

- As concerns Phase 2, Mr. Hart relies on Oxus Gold 2011 Annual Report
and Accounts (R-508) and the fact AGF operated for barely three months
2011 before Oxus’ declaration of force majeure of 18 March 2011. The
Arbitral Tribunal understands that Mr. Hart relied on Oxus’ Annual Report
to determine taxes paid by AGF because he had no access to AGF’s own
accounting books. Whilst this approach may not be beyond criticism, the
Arbitral Tribunal nevertheless considers Mr. Hart’s finding sufficiently
reliable given that by 2011, operations at AGF had almost completely
ceased and force majeure was declared on 18 March 2011. In addition,
there is no further information in Mr. Haberman’s reports as to taxes paid
by AGF in 2011. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal considers it sufficiently
credible that no taxes were paid by AGF in 2011, and that therefore no
damage was incurred neither by AGF nor by OXUS in 2011 in relation to
the 2006 and 2009 changes to the tax laws.

888. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that Mr Hart did not provide any yearly calculations,

88!

891

9.

S

but quantified Claimant’s claim on the basis of the actual amount of taxes paid by
AGF from 2004 through 2010 and of the forecasted taxes for the period
2004-2010. The Arbitral Tribunal will specifically address this point with regard
to the question of the relevant interest rate (see below para. 987).

As concerns Mr. Haberman’s calculations of the cash-flow impact, the Arbitral
Tribunal notes that Claimant has not included the relevant amounts into its formal
requests for relief. In any event, Claimant has not sufficiently substantiated or
explained, not does it clearly arise from Mr. Haberman’s analysis, on which basis
and to what extent Claimant would be entitled to claim any damage relating to
such cash-flow impact. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided to disregard the
cash-flow impact brought forward in Mr. Haberman’s analysis.

2.5.1.4 Conclusion

. In conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal grants Claimant a compensation of USD

10,299,572 for the damage caused by Respondent’s violation of Article 2(2) of the
BIT with regard to the tax law changes of 2006 and 2009.

Moral Damages
2.5.2.1 Claimant's Claimed Amount
A further question is whether Claimant should be entitled to moral damages, as
claimed by Claimant under its AGF Claim No. 16 for an amount of USD 2 million

(see above para 133).

2.5.2.2 The Parties’ Positions

. According to Claimant®, relying in particular on Article 31 of the ILC Articles on

State Responsibility and on arbitral decisions principally in the Lusitania cases*!,
on France v. Venezuela (Antoine Fabiani case no. 1 ye? and Desert Line Projects v.
Yemen®, investment treaties do not prevent a party from obtaining compensation
for moral damages it has suffered and arbitral tribunals have long upheld the
notion of moral damages. In its view, such compensation can relate to emotional
harm, pathological harm and minor consequences of wrongful act.

. Claimant alleges a campaign of persecution against it mostly relating to the

aggressive 2011 State Audit, including charges of espionage and imprisonment of
one of its employees and charges or a harassment campaign against other
employees, all of which affected Claimant’s reputation and finances (Claim. PHB
I. 21.07.2014, paras. 115, 128, 134 and 135; Claim. PHB IL. 21.08.2014, paras. 9
and 114; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 88, 1163-1164, 1166, 1168-1170,
1173-1183, 1185-1186, 1193-1203, 1305, 1484-1485 and 1492; Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, paras. 441, 449, 611, 625 and 717-720).

As to Respondent™, it is of the view that Claimant is not entitled to moral
damages, arguing that its request is unsupported in fact and as a matter of law and
that moral damages are only rarely recoverable under international law, and only
in extraordinary circumstances.

2.5.2.3 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

Moral damages have been considered admissible under international law and it is
recognized that legal persons may be awarded moral damages, including for loss

of reputation, but the bar for recovery of such damages has been set high and they
have been awarded only in exceptional circumstances; Claimant itself
acknowledged as much* in quoting approvingly the Desert Line Projects Projects
v. Ukraine award which stated: “(e)ven if investment treaties primarily aim at
protecting property and economic values, they do not exclude, as such, that a party

. . . - . 9936
may, in exce] 1 circumstances, ask for com for moral d :

. Desert Lines Projects is one of the rare cases in which such damages were

awarded; the tribunal in that case noted that “the physical duress exerted on the
executives of the Claimant, was malicious and is therefore constitutive of a fault-
based liability”*”. The claimant in that case referred in particular to a Government-
led “siege with artillery”**
personnel — including the son of the Claimant’s chairman’

and the “arrest and detention of the Claimant’s
9939

In the Lemire case also quoted approvingly by Claimant, the tribunal held as
follows:

“The conclusion which can be drawn from the above cases is that, as a general
rule, moral damages are not available to a party injured by the wrongful acts of
a State, but that moral damages can be awarded in exceptional cases, provided
that

-the State’s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous
situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which
civilized nations are expected to act;

-The State’s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental
suffering such as humiliation, shame and degrad
credit and social position; and

, or loss or

-both cause and effect are grave and substantial.”

Similarly, in Waguib Elie George Siag & Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of
Egypt"!, the Tribunal declared that “the recovery of punitive or moral damages is
reserved for extreme cases of egregious behavior”.

. Finally, in Tza Yap Shum v. Peru”, also mentioned by Claimant, a claim for moral

damages was rejected and the tribunal endorsed the demanding criteria enunciated
in Lemire.”

. There is therefore little, if any, difference between the Parties concerning the legal

criteria to be applied in relation to a claim for moral damages. The Parties divide
as to whether Respondent’s actions constituted such egregious behavior as to open
the door to moral damages.

. Upon careful review of the facts, the Arbitral Tribunal has come to the conclusion

that Claimant is not entitled to such damages in the present case.

. The Arbitral Tribunal has already ruled (see above para. 826) that the 2011 State

Audit and the other events surrounding it could not be considered as the cause of
the catastrophic situation in which Claimant found itself but rather as a
consequence of it and, therefore, there could not have been a breach of Article 2(2)
of the BIT.

As to the treatment by Respondent of some members of AGF’s personnel (see
above para. 893), the persons concerned (i.e. Messrs Ashurov, Narziev, Salamatin,
and Yunusov) were employees of AGF, not of Claimant directly. In addition,
whilst the treatment of such persons may be have been harsh, the Arbitral Tribunal
has not received enough evidence to support a conclusion that the prosecutions
initiated were not justified in the circumstances or were of such an egregious
nature as to constitute a breach of Uzbek or international law.

As for Claimant’s loss of reputation and credit, the Arbitral Tribunal has found that
Respondent was liable for a very small part of the claims made by Claimant and
Claimant itself has declared that, by the time of the declaration of force majeure on
March 18, 2011, its share price had practically lost all value, trading at merely
around GBP 0.01“. The Tribunal has also concluded that the 2011 State Audit
was not proven to be in breach of the BIT or international law (see above para.
826). As to the prosecutions against some members of AGF’s personnel, they
concerned employees of AGF and not of Claimant, and most of them occurred
well after the declaration of force majeure and the sharp decline in Claimant’s
share price. Moreover, the Arbitral Tribunal has ruled that it did not receive
enough evidence to support that these prosecutions were not justified under the
BIT or international law.

With Regard to Respondent’s Counter Claims

3.1 Issue No. 6: Does the Arbitral Tribunal have Jurisdiction over
Respondent’s Counter Claims and/or are the Counter Claims
Admissible?

The Parties’ Positions
3.1.1.1 Respondent's Position

In summary, Respondent contends that the Arbitral Tribunal can and should
adjudicate the Counter-claims, which are based on Claimant’s misconduct in its
operation and management of AGF, in particular its misrepresentation, self-
dealing, fraud, and other unlawful conduct, through which it not only
systematically failed to perform its investment obligations but also enriched itself
and its affiliates to the detriment of Respondent and the Uzbek Parties. Thus,
Claimant should be held liable for the damage it thereby caused Respondent and
should be ordered to pay compensation to Respondent in the amount of USD
117.54 million (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 3; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014,
para. 977; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 529).

Respondent relies on the following main line of argument:

(i) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Counter-claims: Relying mainly on
Goetz v. Burundi and Roussalis v. Romania, Respondent argues that when a State
consents to arbitrate under a BIT pursuant to a certain procedural mechanism, that
consent — along with the investor’s acceptance of the offer to consent — must
encompass counter-claims if the specified mechanism so provides (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 980; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 530 fol.). Contrary to
Claimant’s assertion, Article 8 of the BIT does not exclude jurisdiction over
counter-claims; on the contrary, by its reference to the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules, Article 8(2) specifically endorses the State’s consent to the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules and therewith to the adjudication of counter-claims (Resp. PHB
I. 21.07.2014, para. 150; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 978). Thus, based on
Article 8 of the BIT and Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,
which provides that a party may “make a counterclaim or rely on a claim for the
purpose of set-off provided that the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction over it”, the

358

909.

910.

So

o

Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to adjudicate the counter-claims raised by
Respondent (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 149; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014,
para. 980).

(ii) The counter-claims are sufficiently connected to Claimant’s claims:
According to Respondent, the Parties agree that a counter-claim is admissible if it
has “a close connection to the primary claim.” (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para.
982; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1568; SoD; para. 532; Saluka v. Czech
Republic, Paushok v. Mongolia, Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan). Relying mainly on
Goetz v. Burundi and Kléckner v. Cameroun, Respondent contends that such close
connection is given where the entire investment operation shows a certain unity
and where “reciprocal obligations” of the claimant and respondent arise from the
same sources (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 983). The Parties further agree
that a counter-claim is not sufficiently connected if it is based solely on alleged
violations of a State’s generally applicable domestic laws, rather than on rights
and obligations that apply as a consequence of the investment (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 984, Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, para. 1574-1577, Resp.
SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 540-541, Saluka v. Czech Republic). However,
according to Respondent, this is not to say that any involvement of local law in a
dispute necessarily precludes adjudication of a counter-claim (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 984). Respondent contends that its counter-claims concern
Claimant’s breach of investment and international law obligations that do not
solely derive from violations of domestic Uzbek law or fall within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Uzbek courts, but rather, the counter-claims are based on
Claimant’s violation of (i) investment obligations and general principles of
international law, as well as (ii) Uzbek law, which arose specifically through
Claimant’s investment in AGF Joint Venture. Specifically, Claimant engaged in
misrepresentations, self-dealing, fraud, and other unlawful conduct throughout its
management and operation of AGF, thereby unjustly enriching itself and its
related companies to the detriment of Respondent, in violation of, inter alia,
specific investment obligations set forth in the relevant investment instruments
(Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 151 fol.; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 987,
989; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, paras. 176-181). In addition, Claimant’s
actions also violated the principle of good faith as a matter of international law.
(Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 988; Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 542).
The mere fact that Claimant’s misconduct also implicates certain violation of
local law does not render them inadmissible. (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para.
989). Respondent underscores that all of its counter-claims arise directly out of
Claimant’s primary claims, and should be admitted on this basis.

For example, Respondent’s counter-claim under the Special Dividend Agreement
does not arise out of any general violation of Uzbek law, but rather is based on a
contract concluded between Claimant and the Ministry of Finance, and arises
directly out of Claimant’s undisputed failure to comply with its payment

359

911.

912.

913.

obligations thereunder. Even if the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it has no
jurisdiction over Respondent’s counter-claim under the Special Dividend
Agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal nonetheless should admit this counter-claim as a
set-off defense. According to Respondent, Article 23(1) of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules does not prevent an Arbitral Tribunal admitting a set-off
defense arising from a claim to money falling outside its jurisdiction if that claim
is liquid and undisputed. In the present case, Respondent’s counter-claim under
the Special Dividend Agreement is a claim to money that is both liquid and
undisputed; it thus should be admitted as a set-off defense, regardless of the
Arbitral Tribunal’s finding with respect to jurisdiction. The same applies to the
counter-claim for damages sustained by Claimant’s unlawful use of AGF’s
Barclay’s Bank account (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 152 fol.; Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, paras. 64 fol.).

(iii) The Counter-claims are properly asserted against Claimant: Respondent
rejects Claimant’s cricisim that it has failed to properly address its counter-claims.
Respondent contends that it has sufficiently demonstrated that Claimant’s actions,
through its operation and management of AGF, directly resulted in harm to
Respondent, including that Claimant “fraudulently and unjustly enriched itself and
its affiliated companies through misrepresentation, fraud, numerous illegal
related-party transactions, and the systematic inflating of costs in its operation of
AGF.” To the extent that Claimant had de facto the total control and management
of AGF, Claimant may not discharge itself by shifting the responsibility on its
Uzbek partners (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 991; Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 543).

(iv) The counter-claims are sufficiently particular: Respondent also rejects
Claimant’s criticism that it has failed to sufficiently develop or elaborate on its
counter-claims to satisfy an analysis on the merits. Respondent contends that it
has comprehensively detailed the grounds for its counter-claims in its Statement
of Defense and Rejoinder and that there is no requirement for Respondent to
detail the very same facts established in its defense to Claimant’s claims in a
separate heading called “Counterclaims” (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 993).
According to Respondent, its treatment of the evidence in the factual sections of
its submissions and Mr. Hart’s report on the damage suffered by Respondent
amply demonstrate Claimant’s unlawful conduct in violation of its investment
obligations, general principles of international law, and Uzbek law (Resp.
Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 993 referring to Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para.
44-337 and Hart I and Hart II).

Based thereon, the Arbitral Tribunal should hold Claimant liable for the
substantial damage that Respondent has suffered as a result of Claimant’s
unlawful conduct, including, in particular, Claimant’s failure to pay sums
admittedly owed to the Ministry of Finance under the Special Dividend

360

914.

915.

916.

917.

Agreement, the numerous self-interested transactions that Claimant caused AGF
to enter into with Claimant and/or its affiliates, and its operation of AGF in
violation of the Republic’s currency laws, totaling USD 117.54 million (Resp.
PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 149, 154).

Alternatively, any amounts awarded to Claimant should be reduced in accordance
with the doctrine of contributory fault reflected in Article 39 of the ILC Articles
on State Responsibility, which provides that, “[i]n the determination of
reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by willful or
negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in
relation to whom reparation is sought.” (Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 67).

3.1.1.2 Claimant’s Position

Claimant concludes that Respondent’s counter-claims should be declared
inadmissible and, in any event, be dismissed as a result of Respondent’s failure to
substantiate the basis for and to particularize its AGF counter-claims.

Claimant relies therefore on the following four main arguments:

(i) The BIT does not allow counter-claims: According to Claimant, the submission
of counter-claims under Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is only
conditionally permitted, “provided that the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction over
[the counter-claims].” Thus, Article 21(3) only permits counter-claims where the
parties have consented to their submission. However, in the present case, no such
consent was given. Article 8(1) of the BIT only authorizes the submission to
international arbitration of “[d]isputes between a national or company of one
Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of
the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which
have not been amicably settled.” Thus, a contrario, disputes concerning claims
from a Contracting Party — in this case Uzbekistan — against a national or
company of the other Contracting Party — in this case Claimant — are inadmissible.
In that sense, Article 8 of the BIT differs in its wording from other BITs, such as
the Belgo-Luxembourg — Burundi BIT on which the case Goetz v. Burundi is
based, the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT on which the Saluka v. Czech
Republic case is based or the Germany-Ghana BIT on which the Hamester v.
Ghana case is based. As such, these cases are of no avail to Respondent in the
present case. Instead, Claimant refers to Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania, where
Article 9(1) of the Greece-Romania BIT uses similar terms to Article 8(1) of the
BIT. Consequently, under Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and
Article 8(1) of the BIT, the Arbitral Tribunal only has jurisdiction over claims
“concerning an obligation of the [State Party, i.e., Uzbekistan] under this
Agreement.” Since Respondent’s counter-claims do not relate to a dispute

361

918.

919.

concerning an obligation of Uzbekistan under the BIT, they fall outside the scope
of the Treaty’s dispute settlement provision, and the Arbitral Tribunal does not
have jurisdiction to rule on these claims (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 187-
192; Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1530 fol.).

(ii) Respondent’s counter-claims fail the “close connection test”: Even if the
Arbitral Tribunal were to hold that counter-claims were not excluded under the
terms of Article 8(1) of the BIT, Respondent’s counter-claims would still be
inadmissible as they do not satisfy the requirement, spelled out in the Saluka v.
Czech Republic case in reference to the Kléckner v. Cameroon case, that
investment treaty counter-claims must bear a close connection to the primary
claims (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 193). In both Saluka v. Czech Republic
and Paushok v. Mongolia, the Arbitral Tribunal held that such “close connection”
is not given, where the counter-claims advanced by the respondent State are based
on alleged breaches of this State’s domestic law, that is the Arbitral Tribunal
cannot entertain counter-claims which ought to be resolved in accordance with
domestic law rather than via the terms of the BIT. In the present proceedings,
Respondent’s counter-claims arise out of Uzbek law and are therefore
inadmissible (Claim. Am.Reply. 23.08.2013, paras. 1514 fol.). In this regard,
Claimant underscores that Respondent has not substantiated or provided any
explanation as to how Claimant’s incriminated conduct — even if proven — would
constitute a breach of “investment and international law obligations” (Claim. PHB
I. 21.07.2014, paras. 193 fol.). Further, Respondent was unable to provide any
terms in the BIT or case authority to support its position that the breach of the
principle of good faith could give rise to a counter-claim under the BIT, as no
such terms or authority exist. None of the awards referred to by Respondent,
including Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic or Plama v. Bulgaria, address the
issue whether counter-claims invoked by a host State for breach by an investor of
the general principle of good faith may fall within the jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal. Claimant stresses that a general principle as broad as that of good faith
cannot be used, under just any BIT, as a valid cause of action by a host State
against an investor (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 197 fol.).

(iii) Respondent's counter-claims are not properly addressed, as they are directed
against AGF, instead of Claimant: Respondent justifies its approach based on the
argument that Claimant exercised total control over the AGF Joint Venture.
However, Respondent firstly failed to establish that Claimant has ever exercised
total managerial control over AGF. In any event, Claimant cannot possibly be
deemed to have ever exerted sole control over AGF, as the State ultimately held a
50% interest in AGF and Respondent had a Ministry of Finance representative on
AGF’s Supervisory Board, on which the Chairman of Goskomgeology also held a
controlling position. As such, Respondent’s counter-claims cannot properly be
directed against Claimant, whether these counter-claims be based on Claimant’s
purported mismanagement of AGF or on Claimant’s purposed misuse of its

362

920.

3.1.2

921.

922.

control over AGF. In either case, Respondent’s counter-claims should have been
directed against AGF. The only readily identifiable counter-claim which is
directed at Claimant itself concerns the counter-claim based on the Special
Dividend Agreement. However, such Agreement was imposed on Claimant under
coercion and duress and constitutes a breach of the FET principle and/or
prohibition of discriminatory treatment and may thus not give rise to a counter-
claim of Respondent.

(iv) Respondent has failed to sufficiently develop or elaborate on its counter-
claims: Claimant contends that in its Statement of Defense, Respondent spent
only one paragraph outlining a few counter-claims “in cursory terms” before
claiming an amount of USD 106,1 million in damages, referring to preceding
submissions and Mr. Hart’s report in guise of appropriate particulars. In its
Rejoinder, Respondent then merely stated that it “comprehensively detailed the
grounds for its counterclaims in the Statement of Defense and had further
elaborated those grounds in the Rejoinder and that there is no requirement for
Respondent to repeat in detail the very same facts under a_ separate
‘Counterclaims’ heading.” By doing so, Claimant wonders whether Respondent is
not trying to shift the burden of proof on Claimant. Respondent’s counter-claims
are plainly insufficiently developed to merit any substantial analysis by the
Arbitral Tribunal (Claim. PHB I. 21.07.2014, paras. 204-208).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

3.1.2.1 Preliminary Remarks

There are three key issues concerning Respondent’s counter-claims, i.e. (i)
whether the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over such counter-claims, (ii)
whether they are well-founded, and — if so — (iii) what are their consequences in
terms of monetary damages.

As the party raising a claim, the burden to establish that these three conditions are
met lies on Respondent. This burden has various aspects, including (i) the burden
to raise a sufficiently specific and clear claim, (ii) the burden to substantiate it by
(a) setting out the relevant legal basis and its requirements, as well as (b)
establishing the relevant underlying facts and how they meet the relevant legal
requirements, and finally the burden to (iii) quantify it. Respondent contends
having met such burden and in particular it contends that it has “set out in full the
facts underlying its counterclaims, as well as the basis for, and quantum of, the
losses that is has suffered as a result of Claimant's unlawful conduct.” (Resp.
PHB II. 21.08.2014, para. 68). In contrast, Claimant contests that Respondent has
met this burden.

363

923.

924.

925.

926.

927.

Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal will first identify Respondent’s specific
counter-claims, and to the extent they are sufficiently substantiated, it will rule on
its jurisdiction over such Counter-claims.

3.1.2.2 Identifying Respondent's Specific Counter Claims

It is first noteworthy that in none of its submissions has Respondent articulated its
counter-claims in formal ‘Requests for Relief”. Instead, all of Respondent’s
written submissions end as follows: “For all the reasons set forth above,
Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal dismiss Claimant's claims in
their entirety and issue a decision in 364otall of Respondent in respect of its
Counterclaims” (see Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 547; Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, para. 999; Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 155; Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, para. 69).** Thus, whilst Respondent is requesting “a decision in [its
364otall] in respect of its Counter-claims”, it does not itemize what these counter-
claims exactly consist in.

It is therefore necessary to study Respondent’s submissions to identify the specific
object of its “counter-claims” and, in this regard, it appears that Respondent’s
approach varies across its various submissions:

In its Response to the Notice of Arbitration, Respondent identified eight main
factual bases for its counter-claims, i.e. (i) failure to perform investment
obligations and introduce new technologies, (ii) failure to conduct exploration
works and field developments, (iii) low efficiency of gold ore processing, (iv)
failure to return export proceeds, (v) breach of financial standards and rules, (vi)
violation of foreign currency regulations regarding payments under import
contracts, (vii) breach of mining rules and labor protection requirements, (viii)
breach of environmental regulations (Resp. RNoA. 30.09.2011, paras. 33-52). At
the same time, Respondent specified however that its Response to the Notice of
Arbitration “does not set out each of Respondent's counter-claims in detail as [...]
such counterclaims will be elaborated in the Statement of Defense and other
pleadings.” (para. 28).

In its Statement of Defense of 4 April 2014, Respondent claimed damages of “at
least US$ 106.1 million” arising out of alleged violations by Claimant of “its
investment obligations, general principles of international law and Uzbek law”
consisting in “misrepresentation, self-dealing, fraud, and other unlawful conduct
throughout its operation of AGF, and systematically failed to perform its
investment obligations, thereby enriching itself and its affiliates to the detriment

In its Response to the Notice of Arbitration, Respondent formulated its Request in a similar way,
ie: “An award in favour of the Respondents of compensatory damages, in an amount to be
quantified in the proceedings.” (p. 13, lit. iii).

364

929.

of Respondent and the Uzbek parties.” (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 529).
In this regard, Respondent relied on the expert reports of Messrs Hart and Rigby
(see Hart I para. 45 n.10, para. 320, Table 8.1 and Exhibit 6, and Rigby I, para. 76,
Table 5.4). Respondent further stressed that it “does not seek payment of fees,
taxes or other damage arising from non-compliance with the general laws of
Uzbekistan. Rather, the counterclaims and attendant damages arise directly out of
Claimant's misrepresentations and Claimant's unlawful and negligent conduct in
exercising complete control over the operation and management of the AGF joint
venture, the same investment at issue in the primary claims brought by Claimant”
(Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013, para. 541). Respondent then argues that the basis
for its counter-claims lies in the principle of good faith: “A general obligation of
good faith thus gives rise to the more specific obligation on the part of an investor
to act in good faith in the conclusion, interpretation, and performance of its
contracts, investment authorizations, and other similar legal instruments, {reference
omitted] the failure of which provides the basis to bring counterclaims in an
international arbitration. That is the case here, where Claimant made
misrepresentations and acted fraudulently and in bad faith and abused the
investment rights granted to it in good faith by Respondent, thereby causing
Respondent significant damage. Claimant's inexcusable conduct, moreover,
violates the Uzbek Civil and Criminal Code provisions prohibiting, among other
things, fraud, bad faith, and unjust enrichment” (Resp. SoD.Class. 04.04.2013,
para. 542). Respondent relies in this regard on the Uzbek Civil Code, Arts. 123,
1023 et seq. (Exh. R-28) and the Uzbek Criminal Code, Arts. 167-68, 175, 178,
205, 207 (Exh. R-237).

In its Amended Rejoinder of 22 February 2014, Respondent claims for an amount
of USD 109 million representing the damage caused by Claimant’s “misconduct
in the operation and management of the AGF Joint Venture” (Resp. Am.Rej.
21.02.2014, paras. 25, 27 and 29, and also 991) and are based on Claimant’s
violation of “its investment obligations, general principles of international law
and also Uzbek law.” (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 27, 993). Respondent then
argues that “Claimant's misconduct is more than sufficiently developed to enable
the Tribunal to adjudicate the counterclaims arising from that misconduct.”
(Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 29 and 993).

In this regard, Respondent describes this misconduct as “including (i) Claimant’s
misrepresentations as to financing of the AGF Joint Venture; (ii) Claimant’s waste
of natural resources; (iii) Claimant’s breach of the Special Dividend Agreement;
(iv) Claimant’s engagement in self-dealing and related-party transactions; and (v)
Claimant’s currency law violations and corresponding failure to provide promised
foreign currency and other benefits.” (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 30, see
also para. 977). Respondent further substantiates these points as follows:

365

“996 [...] Respondent has clearly articulated, and supported with ample
evidence, the factual basis for each of its counterclaims:

Claimant’s Misrepresentations as to Financing of the AGF Joint
Venture — Claimant misrepresented how it would finance the Joint
Venture. In order to gain approval of its investment in AGF, Claimant
represented that it would invest its own funds, in the form of equity or
interest-free loans. Claimant failed to do this, and instead, negotiated
an onerous financing deal with Standard Bank, which caused the State
to lose money by detrimentally impacting profits and, thus, the taxes
and dividend amounts that would have otherwise been distributed to the
State. Moreover, Claimant also unjustly enriched itself by making
interest-bearing loans to AGF which earned Claimant millions of
dollars in interest. This further depressed AGF’s revenues and the level
of funds available to pay out as dividends.

Claimant's Waste of Natural Resources — Claimant’s mismanagement
and operation of AGF’s mining and processing operations resulted in
wasted natural resources, including unprocessed ore, and significant
levels of gold lost in unrecoverable tailings and silver locked within the
heap leach facility. Claimant’s recovery of unacceptably low levels of
gold and silver correspond to lost revenue for the Joint Venture
detrimentally impacting both tax and dividend distributions to the State.
Further, Claimant’s mining failures resulted in an additional cost to the
State as millions of dollars must be spent to bring the mined pits at
Vysokovoltnoye and Asaukak into compliance with Uzbek regulations —
a requirement before any further mining can be conducted — and to

rehabilitate Pit No. I at Centralny to permit access to the sulphide
deposits, (ference omited]

Claimant's Breach of the Special Dividend Agreement — Claimant was
responsible for AGF’s entering into a financing arrangement and
related hedging agreement with Standard Bank. In recognition of the
harm caused to AGF and State by its actions, Claimant concluded the
Special Dividend Agreement with the State pursuant to which it
undertook to remedy the issue, and repay the State. As Respondent
demonstrates, Claimant entered into this agreement freely, yet has
never fulfilled its payment obligations to the State. ("tne ome]

 

Claimant’s | Engagement in Self-Dealing and _ Related-Party
Transactions — Claimant directed AGF funds to itself, contractors who
were shareholders of Claimant, and to parties closely related to
Claimant and its Directors, including MAED, BCM, and MRT. '"*""*
emited] The links between Claimant and these related-parties created
perverse incentives to increase costs, with the corresponding
detrimental impact on revenue, negatively impacting taxes and
resulting in little to no profits for the promised dividend payments to the
State.

Claimant's Failure to Provide Promised Foreign Currency and Other
Benefits — Claimant exercised complete control over AGF’s foreign
exchange account at Barclays Bank, in gross violation of Uzbek law.
Claimant failed to appropriately repatriate foreign currency generated

366

by the Joint Venture and deposited into the Barclays Bank account,
thereby detrimentally impacting the State’s foreign exchange reserves,
and reducing the tax revenue that otherwise would have been directed

to the State as a result of the revenues generated by the Joint Venture.
[reference omitted]

997. In both its Statement of Defense and above, Respondent has plainly
demonstrated that Claimant’s violations have caused financial
damage to Respondent both in its capacity as the State, and as a
shareholder of Goskomgeology and NGMK, shareholders in the AGF
Joint Venture.

998. Finally, Respondent's expert, Mr. Hart, has calculated the minimum
amount of damage that Respondent has suffered as a result of
Claimant's misrepresentations, fraud, self- dealing, other violations of
Uzbek law in the operation of AGF, and mismanagement of AGF. In
his first report, Mr. Hart delineated and quantified Respondent's
damages arising from Claimant's violations, |" °] and he
reiterates and updates his observations as to Claimant’s actions
herein, ("erence omitted] fy Hart maintains that, at a minimum,
Claimant's actions resulted in US$ 109 million in damages.”

930. Although Respondent largely relies on the conclusions of its expert Mr. Hart, the
latter does not present these claims in a fully identical way. Instead, in section 9 of
his report, Mr. Hart summarizes the counter-claims along eight themes,
concluding as follows:

Table 9.1: Summary of Counterclaim Damages

931.

932.

933.

934.

Thus, according to Mr. Hart’s conclusions, which form the underlying basis for
Respondent’s counter-claims, there would be seven separate counter-claims
related to damages allegedly caused by (i) wasted resources due to Oxus’
mismanagement of the AGF Project, (ii) payment to Oxus for goods and services
without supporting accounting documents, (iii) the financing of AGF by Oxus
through loans instead of equity and the improper repayment of such debts by AGF
to Oxus, eliminating almost all distributable AGF profit, (iv) management and
administration fees paid to Oxus in excess of the contractually agreed 5%, (v) the
need to restore the mining site due to Oxus’ improper methods of mining during
Phase 1, (vi) the unpaid debt under the Special Dividend Agreement, and (vii)
unspecified payments to ORC with no supporting documents.

Respondent considers Claimant responsible for this misconduct, because it had
“complete control of AGF’s operations” and was solely responsible for “AGF’s
inefficiencies and failures.” (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, paras. 991 and 992).

In its Post-Hearing Brief of 21 July 2014, Respondent does not reiterate the
factual or legal basis of its counter-claims, and instead insists that “[t]he Tribunal,
moreover, can and should assert jurisdiction over Respondent’s counterclaims
based on Claimant’s misconduct in its operation and management of AGF, and
should order Claimant to pay damages to Respondent in the amount of USD
117.54 million.” (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 3).

In its Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief of 21 August 2014, Respondent did not
either reiterate the factual or legal basis for its claims, but merely summarized its
position on the counter-claims as follows (para. 68): “Respondent also has set out
in full the facts underlying its counterclaims, as well as the basis for, and quantum
of, the losses that it has suffered as a result of Claimant’s unlawful
conduct.("Ferene tel The Tribunal thus should hold Claimant liable for the
substantial damage that Respondent has suffered as a result of Claimant’s
unlawful conduct, including Claimant's failure to pay sums admittedly owed to
the Ministry of Finance under the Special Dividend Agreement, the numerous self-
interested transactions that Claimant caused AGF to enter into with Claimant
and/or its affiliates, and its operation of AGF in violation of the Republic’s
currency laws, 368otalling US$ 117.54 million.” As concerns the amount of USD
117.54 million, it is composed as follows (see Resp. PHB II. 21.08.2014 para. 68,
footnote 299; see also Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 71, 154, and footnote no.
591):

USD 12,738.597 as of 21 July 2014 for the debt under the Special Dividend
Agreement;

368

935.

936.

937.

- USD 98.31 million for “Respondent's remaining counterclaims [i.e. other
than that under the Special Dividend Agreement]” which are “likewise [...]
based on Claimant’s management and operation of AGF”;

- USD 4.42 million in payments to MRT; and

- USD 2,062,646.42 in silver sales that Claimant stole from AGF, which is
likewise [...] liquid and undisputed, and thus also should be admitted as a
set-off defense.”

Thus, whilst Respondent tends to describe its counter-claims in its submissions as
generally arising out of Claimant’s alleged misconduct, abuse of its investment
rights and failure to comply with its investment obligations, it appears that its
counter-claims can be split into three groups:

(i) Claims for general misconduct by Claimant/AGF for a total amount of
USD 102.73 million (hereinafter the “Misconduct counter-claims”);

(ii) Claims under the Special Dividend Agreement for an amount of USD
12,780,495 (hereinafter the “SDA counter-claims”);

(iii) Claims arising out of the sale of silver for an amount of USD
2,062,646.42 (hereinafter the “Silver sale counter-claims”).

Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal shall examine whether it has jurisdiction over these
counter-claims and, if so, whether Respondent sufficiently established that they
are well-founded.

3.1.2.3 Lack of Jurisdiction

Respondent’s counter-claims are built on the following double premise:

(i) As concerns the factual premise of the counter-claims, Respondent
contends that it duly substantiated the factual basis for its counter-claims,
because it is the same as the factual basis on which it relies to defend on
Claimant’s claims. As such, Respondent would not need to substantiate
these facts under a separate heading “Counter-Claims”.

(ii) As concerns the legal basis, Respondent’s counter-claims are built on the
premise that, given that the claims and the counter-claims are based on
the same factual basis, by rejecting Claimant’s claims for breach of the
BIT, the Arbitral Tribunal “will have made all of the determinations

369

938.

939.

oO

940.

941.

942.

necessary to decide Respondent’s counterclaim, thereby demonstrating
that the counterclaim is closely linked to Claimant’s primary claim.”
(Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 152).

Based on the considerations below, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that
these premises are erroneous.

Respondent has to establish (i) that the counter-claims fall under the jurisdiction
ratione materiae of the Arbitral Tribunal, (ii) what are exactly the international
obligations that Claimant is said to have breached, and (iii) what are the specific
actions of Claimants which are in breach of such international obligations. As
conceded by Respondent, a mere breach of domestic law is not sufficient to
trigger an international liability of Claimant under the BIT.

As concerns the first requirement, ie. the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
Respondent’s counter-claims are built on the double premise that (i) Article 8 of
the BIT combined with Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
contemplate Claimant’s consent to the adjudication of the counter-claims in the
same proceedings as Claimant’s claims, and that (ii) to the extent that “C/aimant’s
claims and Respondent’s counterclaims both arise out of the same “transaction or
occurrence”, and that “Respondent’s counterclaims [...] are the direct
counterpart to Claimant’s claims under the BIT’, a sufficient “close connection”
or “nexus” exists between Claimant’s claims and Respondent’s counter-claims to
justify the admissibility of Respondent’s counter-claims. (Resp. SoD.Class.
04.04.2013, para. 541; Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014 paras. 983 fol.).

In other words, according to Respondent, to the extent that “Respondent’s
counterclaims are based on Claimant’s violation of its investment obligations,
general principles of international law, and also Uzbek law — and arise directly out
of Claimant’s misconduct in the operation and management of the AGF joint
venture, the very same investment at issue in the claims brought by Claimant”,
they “are sufficiently connected to Claimant’s claims, and the mere fact that
Claimant’s misconduct also implicates certain violations of local law does not
render them inadmissible.” (Resp. Am.Rej. 21.02.2014, para. 27).

According to Claimant, the BIT does not allow counter-claims. Whilst Claimant
does not dispute that Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
conditionally permits the submission of counter-claims by a respondent party,
Claimant contends that the conditional element, i.e. “that the arbitral tribunal has
jurisdiction over [the counter-claim]”, is not met in the present case. This would
be because Article 8(1) of the BIT only allows arbitration of claims “concerning
an obligation of the [State Party] under this Agreement”, i.e. only disputes
concerning the obligations of Uzbekistan under the BIT may be considered by the

947.

948.

Arbitral Tribunal (Claim. Am.Reply 23.08.2013, paras. 1454 fol.). As a
consequence, Respondent’s counter-claims would be inadmissible as excluded by
the terms of Article 8(1) of the BIT and thus also barred under Article 21(3) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. With regard to Respondent’s arguments which
rely on ICSID or ICC arbitration practice, Claimant contends that these are not
applicable in the present case (Claim. Am.Reply 23.08.2013, para. 1472).

The Parties agree that the question of jurisdiction and admissibility of the counter-
claims is to be determined based on Article 8(1) of the BIT and Article 21(3) of
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Parties’ disagreement concerns the
meaning and effect of these two provisions.

As concerns Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Arbitral
Tribunal does not consider that this provision creates a jurisdiction where there is
none. All it does is stating that counter-claims are admissible and can be
submitted to the extent that they already fall under the scope of jurisdiction of the
Arbitral Tribunal.

In the present case, the scope of jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is defined by
Article 8(1) of the BIT. The key question is thus whether this provision makes
room for counter-claims as the ones at hand.

As mentioned above (see para. 124 General Part), Article 8(1) provides as
follows:

“(1) Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this
Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which have not been
amicably settled shall, after a period of three months from written notification
to a claim, be submitted to international arbitration if the national or company
concerned so wishes.”

Thus, the wording of Article 8(1) refers only to disputes ‘

obligation of the latter [i.e. the Contracting Party] under this Agreement.”

“concerning an

The wording of Article 8(1) of the BIT is for this Arbitral Tribunal a clear
indication that the Parties’ consent to arbitration under the BIT only cover claims
from investors against the host State, but not claims from the host State against
the investors, to the possible exception of counter-claims having a close
connection with the investor’s claims, as mentioned below (see below, para. 951).

371

949.

950.

951.

952.

Whilst it is true that several tribunals have in the past accepted the admissibility of
counter-claims in investment arbitrations, the cases relied upon by Respondent are
of no avail for different reasons.

For example, in Saluka v. Czech Republic, the arbitration clause contained in
Article 8 of the BIT between the Kingdom of The Netherlands and the Czech and
Slovak Federal Republic was very different from the present arbitration clause
and referred to “[d]isputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor
of the other Contracting Party, arising in connection with realization of
investments.” As such, Saluka v. Czech Republic cannot serve as reference in the
present case. In Paushok v. Mongolia, Article 6 of the BIT between Russia and
Mongolia also provided for a broad jurisdictional clause referring to “[d]isputes
between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, arising in connection with realization of investments, including disputes
concerning the amount, terms or method of payment of compensation [...)” In
contrast, Article 8(1) of the BIT is very similar to the wording of Article 9 of the
BIT between Greece and Romania, which formed the basis for the claims and
counter-claims raised in Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania. Article 9 of the Greece-
Romania BIT also referred to “[d]isputes between an investor of a Contracting
Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter
under this Agreement” and, in that case, the arbitral tribunal rejected its
jurisdiction (with a dissenting opinion from Prof. Michael Reisman).

As for the other cases relied upon by Claimant and subject to the ICSID
framework, they are equally not of assistance as the consent system under the
ICSID Convention is peculiar and the jurisdictional clauses also differ from the
present case. For example, in Hamester v. Ghana, the jurisdictional clause left
certain ambiguity, which was interpreted by the arbitral tribunal as leaving
sufficient room for counter-claims, though the arbitral tribunal eventually ruled
that in the absence of proper submissions, it was “unable to analyse whether it is
capable, in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, of falling within the
parties’ scope of constent.”

Even, if the Arbitral Tribunal would adopt the position most favourable to the
Respondent, in applying the general principle mentioned in Saluka v. Czech
Republic, according to which there exists “a general principle as to the nature
of the close connection which a counterclaim must have with the primary
claim if a tribunal with jurisdiction over the primary claim is to have
jurisdiction also over the counterclaim” (Saluka v. Czech Republic, para. 76),
and consider therefore that as soon as it has jurisdiction over a claim, it has
jurisdiction over a counter-claim closely linked to that claim, the Tribunal — in
addition to the preliminary hurdle of the wording of Article 8(1) of the BIT — sees
the following further hurdles to its jurisdiction.

372

953.

954.

955.

956.

The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the general principles laid out in Saluka v. Czech
Republic as just mentioned and reiterated in Paushok v. Mongolia, according to
which:

“()n relation specifically to counterclaims, it is necessary that they must also
satisfy those conditions which customarily govern the relationship between a
counterclaim and the primary claim to which it is a response. In particular, a
legitimate counterclaim must have a close connexion with the primary claim to
which it is a response.’”°

and

“In considering whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the
counterclaims, it must therefore decide whether there is a close connection
between them and the primary claim from which they arose or whether the
counterclaims are matters that are otherwise covered by the general law of
Respondent.”

Applied to the present case, this principle means that in order for the Arbitral
Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the counter-claims, it is necessary that there be
a close connection between them and the primary claim from which they arose in
the sense that the counter-claims must be sufficiently connected to the claims, i.e.
arise out of the investment and thereto relating obligations, and may not be
matters merely covered by the general law of the Respondent.

As concerns the misconduct and the silver sale counter-claims, Respondent relies
on general Uzbek law as well as the principle of good faith.

In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that the misconduct and
silver sale counter-claims show the necessary close connection. The reason is that
the underlying factual matrix refers largely to the way in which AGF operated, not
to the circumstances in which Claimant invested into AGF. Respondent tries to
bridge this gap with the argument that Claimant had “total control” over AGF’s
operations. However, in order to succeed with this argument, it is not sufficient
that Claimant had ‘general control’ over AGF; it is further necessary that
Claimant had specific control over the very actions which are constitutive of such
wrongdoings. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that Respondent has failed to
establish such actual control. Besides having a 50% share in AGF, it is undeniable
that the Uzbek Parties had an actual say in the way these operations were
conducted. They played, for example, a determining role in the choice of the
technology to be used or the silver refining process (see above paras. 515, 519,
523-525 and 528). The only relevant facts where Respondent convincingly

“6 Paushok v. Mongolia, para. 689 quoting Saluka v. Czech Republic, para. 61.
“7 Paushok, v. Mongolia, para. 693.

373

957.

958.

showed an actual control by Claimant is the misconduct relating to the alleged
financial irregularities. Indeed, it is undisputed that Claimant had full control over
the Barclays bank account and the funds arriving thereon. However, as concerns
this alleged misconduct, it is largely based on the alleged violations of Uzbek law
restrictions regarding foreign currency and other financial regulations, and the
Respondent did not raise it as a counter-claim as such. In any event, it does not
show the necessary “close connection”.

As concerns the SDA counter-claim, it cannot be denied that the counter-claim
under the Special Dividend Agreement bears a close connection to Claimant’s
claims. However, the obstacle to the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction over this
counter-claim is the forum selection and choice of law clause contained in the
Special Dividend Agreement, which provides as follows:

“9. Settlement of disputes

All disputes which cannot be settled by the Parties by way of negotiations shall
be transferred to a court for a court judgment in accordance with the laws of
the Republic of Uzbekistan.

10. Applicable law and language of the Agreement

This Agreement is [...] guided by the laws of the Republic of Uzbekistan” (Exh.
C-252)

Thus, there are two additional specific hurdles to the Arbitral Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over this counter-claim:

(i) Respondent has not convincingly established that the non-payment of
Claimant’s debt under this Agreement constitutes more than a mere
contractual breach subject to Uzbek law. In particular, a recourse to the
umbrella clause of the BIT is not possible given the wording of such
clause, which expressly refers to obligations of the host State only. Thus,
Respondent may not rely on the umbrella clause to transform a breach of
contract by Claimant into a breach of the BIT. Therefore, it is not clear
how the non-performance of this contractual undertaking would trigger a
liability of Claimant under international law.

(ii) Through the selection of court proceedings under Uzbek law as dispute
resolution mechanism, the Parties have made an express choice for a
specific dispute resolution mechanism. More than that, the dispute has
effectively been brought before the chosen courts, which have confirmed
their jurisdiction (see above section IIL.-1.5.1). Whilst it is true that the
enforcement proceedings of the relevant court decisions have been
stayed for the duration of the present arbitration (see above para. 626;

374

Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 152), Respondent has not explained nor
substantiated what effect an award covering the SDA counter-claim
would have on the enforcement proceedings. In particular, Respondent
has not argued that such award would bind the Uzbek courts. Under such
circumstances, even if the SDA counter-claims would be seen as falling
under the scope of Article 8(1) of the BIT, the Arbitral Tribunal
considers that the forum selection clause contained in Article 9 of the
Special Dividend Agreement constitutes a special agreement between the
Parties by which they provided for a specific dispute resolution
mechanism. This is further confirmed by the fact that (i) Respondent did
initiate court proceedings and not arbitration proceedings to enforce the
debt under the Special Dividend Agreement, and (ii) Claimant did not
raise any objection to the jurisdiction of the Uzbek courts (see Exhs. C-
384 and 388). Thus, through such special agreement, the Parties must be
seen as having excluded their consent to adjudicate disputes arising out
of the Special Dividend Agreement through the mechanism provided for
in the BIT. In other words, this special dispute resolution clause
constitutes a sort of carve-out from a potential jurisdiction under the BIT
and deprives the Arbitral Tribunal of any jurisdiction over such counter-
claims. The same solution has been adopted in Saluka v. Czech Republic,
where the contract on which the counter-claim was based had a specific
dispute settlement clause, which the tribunal considered it had to respect,
citing in support the decision of the Ad hoc Committee in its decision on
annulment in Vivendi v. Argentina :

“In a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an
international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will

give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.”
(Decision of 3 July 2002, para. 55)

3.1.3 Conclusion

959. In conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over
Respondent’s counter-claims.

3.2 Issue No. 7: Set-off

The Parties’ Positions

3.2.1.1 Respondent's Position

Respondent contends that, in case the Arbitral Tribunal finds it has no jurisdiction
over its counter-claims, the Arbitral Tribunal should still admit its counter-claims
as a set-off defense. Respondent, quoting Mourre, contends that Article 23(1) of
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules “does not prevent an arbitral tribunal
admitting a set-off defense arising from a claim to money falling outside its
jurisdiction if that claum is liquid and undisputedallows an arbitral tribunal to
admit a set-off defense, even if it is based on a claim that falls outside of its
jurisdiction over that claim, provided that said claim is both liquid and undisputed
(Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 153; Resp. PHB II 21.08.2014, para. 65).

Both the counter-claim under the Special Dividend Agreement as well as
Claimant’s damage due to the improper use of AGF’s Barclay’s Bank account
consist of claims that are both liquid and undisputed and therefore should be
admitted as a set-off defense (Resp. PHB I. 21.07.2014, para. 153; Resp. PHB II.
21.08.2014, para. 65).

Respondent quantifies its counter-claim under the Special Dividend Agreement at
USD 10,841,256.16 and its counter-claim with regard to Claimant’s unlawful use
of the AGF’s Barclay’s Bank account at USD 2,062,646.42 (Resp. PHB I.
21.07.2014, para. 153; Resp. PHB II 21.08.2014, para. 65). Accounting for
interest under Clause 3 of the Special Dividend Agreement, Respondent quantifies
Claimant’s debt under the Special Dividend Agreement to USD 12,780,495
(Resp. PHB II 21.08.2014, para. 65).

Respondent considers that alternatively, on the basis of the doctrine of
contributory fault as reflected in Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, any amounts awarded to Claimant should be reduced (Resp. PHB
II. 21.08.2014, para. 67).

3.2.1.2 Claimant’s Position

Claimant does not address Respondent’s set off arguments in detail; in its
amended Prayer for Relief, Claimant submitted the following (see above
para. 133):

“1583.18. [Set-Off Claim] Order Respondent to pay the above
amounts outside of Uzbekistan without any right of set-off,”

The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

Article 21(3) UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:

“Tn its statement of defence, or at a later stage in the arbitral
proceedings if the arbitral tribunal decides that the delay was
justified under the circumstances, the respondent may make a
counterclaim or rely on a claim for the purpose of a set-off
provided that the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction over it.”

It is undisputed between the Parties that Respondent, in its previous submissions,
invoked a set-off of the counterclaims it claims to have against Claimant.

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the UNCITRAL Rules specifically address the
question of set-off, given that the abovementioned provision explicitly requires
that the Arbitral Tribunal must have jurisdiction over the claim Respondent brings
forth. Thus, they clearly decide a question that is often controversial under other
arbitration rules.

In the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that it did not have jurisdiction
over the counterclaims invoked by Respondent, thus excluding the two specific
counterclaims on which Respondent relies for the purpose of its set-off.

Admittedly, Respondent quotes an author according to whom there would be an
exception in case a claim is liquid and undisputed. However, Respondent did not
elaborate on the grounds that would justify such an exception and did not provide
any further authorities supporting this position.

The Arbitral Tribunal first notes that the authority quoted by Respondent referred
to Article 19(3) of the previous UNCITRAL Rules. This provision provided as
follows:

“In his statement of defence, or at a later stage in the arbitral
proceedings if the arbitral tribunal decides that the delay was
justified under the circumstances, the respondent may make a
counter-claim arising out of the same contract or rely on a claim
arising out of the same contract for the purpose of a set-off.”

377

971. Contrary to the current Article 21(3) UNCITRAL Rules, this provision did not
explicitly state that an arbitral tribunal may only admit a set-off defence if it has
jurisdiction over the claim upon which a respondent relies for the purpose of its
set-off. Accordingly, the authority quoted by Respondent does not offer any
guidance with regard to the new UNCITRAL Rules.

972.

N

In light of the clear wording of Article 21(3) UNCITRAL Rules, the Arbitral
Tribunal considers that it cannot rely on a set-off defence in the present
arbitration, given that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the
claims upon which Respondent relies for the purpose of its set-off defence.

973.

o

This is however without prejudice to the question of whether Respondent will be
entitled to invoke set-off of its counterclaims during the enforcement proceedings;
this question falls outside the scope of the Arbitral Tribunal’s mandate.

3.2.3 Conclusion

974. In view of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent cannot invoke a
set-off defence against Claimant’s claims.

4 With Regard to the Interests on the Award

4.1 The Parties’ Positions

4.1.1 Claimant’s position

975. Claimant submits that, since Article 5 of the BIT does not explicitly state the date
from which interest is to be calculated, the date of the expropriation should be
relevant, in accordance with the practice of other arbitral tribunals (Claim. SoC.
17.09.2012, para. 724).

976. Furthermore, Claimant argues that the Arbitral Tribunal should make an award of
compound interest and adopt an interest rate of LIBOR + 2% compounded semi-
annually, given that this qualifies as a “normal commercial rate” pursuant to
Article 5 of the BIT (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012, paras 725-728).

977. Claimant relies on the award in Middle East Cement v. Egypt (CL-92), in which it
was held that compound interest, as opposed to simple, is the appropriate standard
for expropriation cases under international law (Claim. SoC. 17.09.2012,
para. 726).

378

978. Claimant’s expert Mr. Haberman considers that it is appropriate to add interest
from the dates at which Claimant was allegedly expropriated to the date of the
award. The appropriate rate to apply to Claimant’s losses should be an
approximation of its corporate borrowing rate at the time. Given Claimant’s size
and its status as an investor in mining projects in Central Asia, the interest rate at
which it could borrow would be considereably higher than risk-free. Accordingly,
a rate of LIBOR + 2% corresponds to Claimant’s corporate borrowing rate (ER
Haberman II (12.08.2013), paras 2.15-2.18).

979. Mr. Haberman considers that, in any event, the amount of interest to be applied is
a matter for the Arbitral Tribunal, in accordance with international law (ER
Haberman II (12.08.2013), para. 2.19).

4.1.2 Respondent’s position

980. Respondent disputes that there is any principle of international law entitling
Claimant to seek an award of compound interest (Resp. SoD. Class. 04.04.2013,
para. 527). Given that local law prohibits compound interest, the Arbitral Tribunal
should consider applying simple interest, although Respondent’s expert Mr. Hart
considers that the issue is ultimately to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal (ER-
Hart I (15.02.2013), para. 327; ER-Hart II (20.02.2014), para. 318).

981. Respondent quotes, inter alia, the decision in Archer Daniels Midland Co. and
Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. United Mexican States (RL-207), where
the arbitral tribunal held that there was no uniform rule of law in international
arbitral practice as to the applicability of simple or compound interest.

982. Respondent’s expert Mr. Hart agrees that it is reasonable to assume that interest
should be payable from the expropriation date or from the date the pending
expropriation was made public knowledge; the date from which interest is paid
should coincide with the valuation date used in order to quantify the claimed
amount (ER-Hart I (15.02.2013), para. 323).

983. Mr. Hart further disputes that LIBOR + 2% is an appropriate rate. In his view,
given that interest is to be awarded on an amount in USD, the interest should also

be based on a US risk-free rate, not at a commercial rate (ER-Hart (15.02.2013),
paras 325-326; ER-Hart IT (20.02.2014), para. 318).

4.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

984. The Arbitral Tribunal first notes that the Parties submitted diverging authorities as
to the question of whether compound or simple interest are to be awarded.

379

985.

986.

987.

988.

989.

990.

The Arbitral Tribunal also acknowledges the agreement between the Parties’
respective experts that interest is to be payable from the expropriation date.

In the case at hand, the expropriation effectively occurred when Claimant paid the
taxes from which it expected to be exempted. Given that the taxes owed by
Claimant are calculated at the end of each year, the interest will start running as of
31 December of each relevant year.

As mentioned above (see above para. 888), Mr. Hart did not provide any yearly
calculations with regard to the taxes paid by AGF; Exhibit 16 to ER-Haberman
(17.08.2012), upon which ER-Hart III (10.07.2014) is based, contains all the
necessary information in order to quantify Claimant’s yearly loss, based on the
methodology described above (see above para. 886 and 887). The Arbitral
Tribunal thus holds that it is for the Parties to determine Claimant’s yearly loss
and to apply the interest rate to said loss as of the 31 December of each relevant
year.

The Arbitral Tribunal further considers that, in recent years, international arbitral
tribunals deciding over investment claims have increasingly awarded compound
interest. As held by the arbitral tribunal in CME Czech Republic BV v. The Czech
Republic, which quoted extensive case law, this has been done in order to take
into account the “prevalent contemporary commercial reality that companies that
borrow pay compound interest”; the financing obligations of the investor have
thus been considered to be circumstances justifying that compound interest are
awarded (RL-223, para. 645; see also CL-81, para. 279; CL-153, para. 348; CL-
154, para. 360; ).

The Arbitral Tribunal also notes that, in Railroad Development Corporation
(RDC) v. Republic of Guatemala, the arbitral tribunal held that “the determination
of whether or not a compound interest rate is applicable needs to be justified by
the Tribunal as any other determination. Given the length of these proceedings
because of two jurisdictional phases in which the jurisdictional objections of
Respondent were rejected, and several postponements in the procedural calendar
at the Government’s request, the Tribunal determines that compound interest is
justified” (CL-81, para. 281). The length and complexity of the proceedings may
thus also constitute an appropriate criterion in order to award compound interest.

The Arbitral Tribunal thus considers that, in light of the length and complexity of
the proceedings and of the current arbitral practice, it is appropriate to adopt the
interest rate of LIBOR + 2% proposed by Claimant, compounded annually.

380

4.3 Conclusion

991. The Tribunal rules therefore that Respondent shall pay to Claimant interests on
the damages awarded to it at the rate of LIBOR + 2%, compounded annually.

992. The interest rate shall be applied to the loss suffered by Claimant as of the
31 December of each corresponding year from 2004 to 2010. The Parties shall
calculate each yearly loss on the basis of the numbers provided by Mr. Hart in
ER-Hart III (10.07.2014).

C. THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS

L The Issue

993. The Arbitral Tribunal recalls the Parties’ positions with regards to costs as
determined in their respective Prayers for Relief.

994. Claimant stated in its Prayer for Relief (see above para. 133) the following claim
on costs:

Order Respondent to pay Claimant the costs of this arbitration, including all
expenses that it has incurred, and including all of the fees and expenses of the
arbitrators, legal counsel, experts and consultants, as well as Oxus’ own
expenses in pursuing this arbitration.

995. Respondent asserted in its Prayer for Relief (see above para. 134) the following
conclusion with regards to costs:

Respondent furthermore respectfully requests that it be awarded all the
expense and costs associated with defending against Claimant’s claims.

996. The Parties had the opportunity to put forth their conclusions on costs in their
respective Statement of Costs submitted on 6 January 2015. They were also given
the opportunity to respond to each other’s Statement of Costs which they both did
on 20 January 2015.

IL. The Parties’ Positions

d. Claimant’s Position

1.1 The Amount Claimed

997. In its Statement of Costs (hereinafter “Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015”), Claimant requested
the Arbitral Tribunal to order Respondent to bear all the fees, costs and expenses
relating to the arbitration proceedings (Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 11).

382

998.

999.

1000.

1001.

1002.

1003.

It also requested the Arbitral Tribunal to order Respondent to reimburse all the
costs with interest at a reasonable commercial rate accruing from the date of the
final award (Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 11).

Claimant quantified its total arbitration costs directly incurred in present
arbitration proceedings at USD 9,546,369.53 (Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 2).

Claimant detailed these costs as follows (Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 2):

(a) Costs and expense of Arbitral Tribunal: USD 800,000.00
(b) Legal fees of counsel for Claimant: USD 6,915,019.59
(c) Expenses of counsel for Claimant: USD 1,078,293.26
(d) Fees, costs and expenses of experts and witnesses: USD 624,494.48
(e) Costs and expenses incurred in preparation of the USD 128,562.10
Hearing:

1.2 The Justification

With regards to the legal fees of counsel (b), Claimant notes that this category of
costs includes not only the legal services and representation provided by Derains
& Gharavi as of February 2012, but also invoices settled for legal services and
advice provided by its former counsel, Amsterdam & Peroff (Cl. Cost.
06.01.2015, para. 4 et seq.). In addition, the category also covers the services of
further legal counsel required for discrete issues regarding the dispute, as well as
Osborne Clarke’s advice regarding corporate aspects of financing the dispute, and
Boyarkin & Partners, Inc.’s advice regarding Uzbek law (Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015,
para. 6).

Claimant further notes that out of the legal fees of counsel (b), USD 406,703.40
relate to the submissions on jurisdiction (comprised of legal fees of USD 314,986
and expenses of USD 25,717.40) (Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 8). At least USD
3,000,000 out of the total legal fees of USD 6,915,019.59 relate to the issues of
fraud, misrepresentation and similar issues raised by Respondent in_ its
inadmissibility defense and its associated counterclaims (idem).

With regards to the expenses of counsel (c), this category of costs includes travel
and accommodation expenses, data management costs and experts’ expenses
(Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 7).

383

1004.

1005.

1006.

1007.

1008.

With regards to the fees, costs and expenses of experts and witnesses (d), this
category covers the minority of such costs that were paid directly by Claimant and
that were not part of the claimed expenses of counsel (c) (Cl. Cost. 06.01.2015,
para. 9).

With regards to the costs and expenses incurred in preparation of the Hearing (e),
this category includes the following: Claimant’s share of the costs for the Hearing
venue; equipment; court reporters and interpreters; expenses for Claimant,
counsel, witnesses and experts; printing and presentation aids (Cl. Cost.
06.01.2015, para. 11).

1.3 Objections to Respondent’s Position

Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal order Claimant to bear all the
costs incurred by Respondent (see below para. 1015). Claimant filed Claimant’s
Comments on Respondent’s Statement of Costs in reply (hereinafter “Cl. Reply
Cost. 20.01.2015”).

Claimant submitted that the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules state in principle that
costs shall be awarded to the successful party and grant the arbitral tribunal
discretion to allocate costs as it deems appropriate based on the circumstances of
the case (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 3). Claimant, however, relied on
Walter Bau v. Thailand and Rumeli v. Kazakhstan and asserts that only limited
assistance can be gained from one BIT arbitration for another, given that all fact
situations are different and that, accordingly, tribunals should consider the
circumstances of each case individually (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 3).

Claimant asserted that, should it succeed on all or some of its claims on the merits
(and their admissibility), the circumstances of the case justify that the Arbitral
Tribunal order Respondent to pay Claimant’s costs in full or in large part (Cl.
Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 6). To this effect, Claimant referred to Veteran
Petroleum v. Russia, Saar Papier Vertriebs GmbH v. Poland, SwemBalt v. Latvia
and Gold Reserve v. Venezuela (idem). In addition, it referred to BG Group v.
Argentina as an example of awarding costs in proportion to the percentage of a
claimant’s successful claims (idem).

1011.

1012.

Claimant requests that, even in the alternative that it should not succeed on some
or all of its claims (including admissibility), it should not be held to pay
Respondent’s costs (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 4). Claimant did not only
succeed regarding Respondent’s objection that Claimant lacked standing
(Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 5), but counsel for Claimant had worked ably,
diligently and efficiently in defense of the Claimant’s interests. Claimant relied on
Romak v. Uzbekistan, in which the tribunal stated that there was a general trend
that had developed that arbitration costs should be equally apportioned between
the Parties, irrespective of the outcome of the dispute, and that the claimant’s
diligent and efficient conduct did not justify shifting costs against it (Cl. Reply
Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 4).

In addition, Claimant asserted, based on EnCana v. Ecuador, that in cases where a
claimant’s BIT claims were unsuccessful, it would be just and equitable for the
respondent State to bear the costs of the arbitration, with each party bearing its
costs of representation (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 4).

Furthermore, Claimant reiterated that its costs are reasonable given the
complexity of the dispute, which is in many respects the result of Respondent’s
strategy (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 7). Moreover, Respondent’s comments
concerning the reasonableness of Claimant’s costs must be analyzed bearing in
mind that Respondent’s costs significantly exceed those of Claimant (Cl. Reply
Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 9).

Finally, Claimant submitted that Respondent, rather than Claimant, caused the
dispute to be complex and costly (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 10). In
particular, Claimant stated the following:

Respondent’s arguments that it incurred additional costs in order to address all
of Claimant’s allegations boils down to the mere complaint that it had to defend
itself against Claimant’s allegations (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 11).

Respondent makes a number of misrepresentations (relating to the Soviet
Studies, Claimant’s development rights in the Khandiza Deposit, an alleged
admission by Mr. Kipps), which do not entitle it to any recovery of costs (Cl.
Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, paras. 13-15).

Claimant’s alleged violations of procedural obligations were in fact fully
explained and justified to the Arbitral Tribunal (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015,
para. 16).

Respondent’s concerns about Claimant’s conduct with regards to witnesses and
the submission of an expert report as a factual exhibit is misplaced (Cl. Reply
Cost. 20.01.2015, paras. 17).

385

- Respondent’s tactics of attrition, disproportionately voluminous submissions
and unnecessary applications regarding confidentiality and documents privilege
complicated the proceedings unnecessarily (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015,
para. 18). In the same vein, Respondent caused the costs resulting from
Claimant’s necessary application for the disqualification of White & Case as
counsel for Respondent and the exchanges regarding the submission of
confidential documents by Respondent (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 19).

- Respondent’s allegations of fraud, corruption and illegality did not meet the
required threshold and its counter-claims were without merit and consistency,
for which it lacked standing (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 20).

- Respondent and its expert, Mr. Pringle. failed to fully disclose the close links
between them, which resulted in his expertise and independence being seriously
questioned at the Hearing (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 21).

2. Respondent’s Position

2.1 The Amount Claimed

1013.In Respondent’s Statement of Costs (hereinafter “Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015”),
Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal order Claimant to bear all of the
costs and expenses incurred by Respondent in connection with the arbitration
(Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, paras. 1 and 30).

1014.Respondent quantified its total costs incurred in the present arbitration
proceedings at USD 15,672,698.10 and EUR 28,852.50 (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015,
para. 1).

1015. Respondent detailed the costs as follows (Resp. Costs. 06.01.2015, para. 1):

(a) Cost and expenses of Arbitral Tribunal: USD 799,976

(b) Fees and expenses of counsel for Respondent: USD 11,657,301.95

(c) Fees and expenses for experts: USD 2,465,265.13

(d) Expenses of witnesses and client representatives for USD 136,435.75 and
the Hearing: EUR 28,852.50

(e) Expenses for translation: USD 613,719.27

386

2.2 The Justification

1016.Given the Treaty’s silence on the issue, Respondent submitted that the Arbitral
Tribunal has discretion to allocate costs as it deems appropriate under Articles 40
and 42 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 5).
Relying on Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the decisions in
Yukos v. Russia, Tembec v. United States, Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic, Plama
v. Bulgaria and Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic and with reference to Libananco
v. Turkey, Respondent submitted that costs should be allocated in accordance with
the principle that “costs follow the event” or “the loser pays”, i.e. that a prevailing
party is entitled to be awarded its reasonable costs in an amount proportionate to
its relative success (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 5—10).

1017.In application of the principle that “costs follow the event”, Respondent
requested, based on Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic, Phoenix Action v. Czech
Republic and Plama v. Bulgaria, that Claimant be ordered to bear all costs for its
claims denied on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and admissibility (Resp. Cost.
06.01.2015, para. 11).

1018. In the event that the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction, that Claimant’s
claims are admissible and that Claimant succeeds on the merits regarding none or
merely a small minority of its claims, Respondent requested arguendo that
Claimant should bear a significant majority of Respondent’s costs, relying on
Thunderbird v. Mexico (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 12).

1019.Respondent submitted that its costs are reasonable (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015,
para. 13-22). Based on the factors to assess the reasonableness a tribunal’s fees
expenses contained in Article 41(1) of the UNCITRAL Apbitration Rules, in
particular the amount in dispute and the complexity of the subject matter (Resp.
Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 13-16), Respondent submitted that its claimed costs are
reasonable in light of the following:

- Considering the amount claimed by Claimant in alleged damages, USD 1.2
billion, previous arbitral tribunals under similar circumstances have awarded
costs ranging from USD S to 15 million (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 17).

- Claimant’s claims cover in fact two projects, Khandiza and AGF, and relate to
five separate heads of claims (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 18).

- The scope of the case spanned approximately six decades and implicated a wide
range of actors (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 19).

- The extensive document record of the present arbitration demonstrates the
magnitude of the case (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 20).

387

- Significant expenses were incurred for Respondent’s witnesses travelling from
Uzbekistan to Paris (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 21). In addition, the Parties
also had to arrange and pay for the Hearing facilities (idem).

- The majority of Respondent’s documents had to be translated from Russian or
Uzbek into English and simultaneous interpretation also had to be arranged at
the Hearing (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 22).

1020. Respondent further contends that Claimant’s conduct throughout the proceedings
significantly increased the costs and that, based on Alps Finance v. Slovak
Republic and Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, the Arbitral Tribunal should order
Claimant to bear the costs of the arbitration (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 23). In
particular, Respondent asserted the following:

- Claimant argued its case in an unnecessarily complex and disorganized fashion
and submitted contradictory claims on a number of occasions (Resp. Cost.
06.01.2015, paras. 23-26).

- Claimant presented its damages claims in an disorganized and piecemeal
manner involving multiple amendments, which resulted in Respondent
incurring additional, unnecessary costs for its rebuttals (Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015,
paras. 27-28).

- Claimant erroneously submitted an expert report as a factual exhibit, repeatedly
changed its list of individuals it intended to call for examination and declined to
call one of its witnesses after Responded had prepared to cross-examine him
(Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 29).

2.3 Objections to Claimant’s Position

1021. Respondent commented on Claimant’s position in Respondent’s Reply Statement
of Costs (hereinafter “Resp. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015”).

1022. Respondent reiterated that costs in UNCITRAL proceedings shall in principle be

awarded to the successful party in an amount proportionate to its relative success
(Resp. Reply Cost 20.01.2015, para. 2).

388

1023. Respondent further reiterated that its costs were reasonable, given the high stakes
and the complexity of the dispute (Resp. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 3).
Respondent’s costs are slightly higher than Claimant’s, given that the latter
unnecessarily increased complexity and cost of the dispute through its
disorganized presentations and given that it is “more time-consuming and costly
to rebut false allegations than it is to make them” (Resp. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015,
para. 4).

1024.Respondent further asserted that Claimant’s costs are “unsubstantiated or
unrecoverable” in the following way (Resp. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 5):

- Even though Respondent alone had to bear the interpretation costs pursuant to
Procedural Order No. 16, Claimant claims their recovery as part of its Hearing
expenses (Resp. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 6). Respondent enclosed two
interpretation service contracts with its Reply Statement of Costs indicating that
it was Respondent who contracted and paid the interpreters. In addition, given
that Claimant relied on the interpreters, in particular for the cross-examination
of Respondent’s witnesses, it should have to reimburse Respondent for these
costs (idem).

- Claimant contended that its expenses for Crowe Clarke Whitehill form part of
experts’ expenses when it had previously insisted that Crowe Clarke Whitehill’s
report was to be characterized as a factual exhibit (Resp. Reply Cost.
20.01.2015, para. 7).

- Claimant’s alleged costs incurred in relation to the financing of the dispute are
unprecedented and should not in any case be borne by Respondent (Resp. Reply
Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 8).

- Expenses alleged by Claimant regarding factual witnesses paid directly by
Claimant itself rather than its counsel should only be covered to the extent that
they are travel expenses, in order to avoid casting further doubt on the
credibility of Claimant’s witnesses (Resp. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 9).

- Claimant’s argument that at least USD 3,000,000 of counsel for Claimant’s
legal fees relates to Respondent’s claims on fraud, misrepresentation and the
similar claims is not reflected in its submissions and is therefore doubtful (Resp.
Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 10).

389

Il. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Findings

L. The Legal Basis

1025.The Arbitral Tribunal recalls Articles 40 and 42 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules are the relevant provision regarding costs:

1.1 Definition of costs

Article 40

1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and,
if it deems appropriate, in another decision.

2. The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with
article 41;

(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the
arbitrators;

(c,

2

The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance
required by the arbitral tribunal;

(da The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent
such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e

2

The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the
arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the
amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees
and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.

3. In relation to interpretation, correction or completion of any award under
articles 37 to 39, the arbitral tribunal may charge the costs referred to in
paragraphs 2 (b) to (f), but no additional fees.

390

1.2 Allocation of costs

Article 42

1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such
costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in
any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to
another party as a result of the decision.

1026.In light of the present arbitration and Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the costs of this arbitration will comprise
the following:

1. The Arbitral Tribunal’s reasonable fees and expenses;

2. The Parties’ reasonable legal fees and expenses; including reasonable
expenses incurred for factual witnesses and experts.

2. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Fees and Expenses

2.1 The Legal Basis

1027.The Arbitral Tribunal recalls that the relevant provision under the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules with regards to arbitrators’ fees and expenses is Article 41, in
particular its first paragraph:

1. The fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be reasonable in amount,
taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject
matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant
circumstances of the case.

2.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Fees and Expenses in the Case at Hand

1028. The Arbitral Tribunal regularly submitted its statements of account to the Parties
when requesting the necessary advances on costs. As of 30 November 2015, the
Arbitral Tribunal’s total fees and expenses amounted to USD 2,297,768.70 (see
Annex 1).

391

1029. In the present case, the values at stake were very high.In addition, as confirmed by
the Parties, the subject matter of the case was particularly complex and required
extensive submissions from both sides (Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 7; Resp.
Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 20), which lead to an increase in the amount of time and
effort invested as well as of costs also for the Arbitral Tribunal. Given the
complex nature of the procedure, the Arbitral Tribunal issued 18 procedural
orders and issued a separate decision on jurisdiction (see above para. 81).

1030. Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal’s fees and expenses are reasonable if measured
against the criteria of Article 41(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. This
conclusion was in any case not put in question by either Party.

3. The Parties’ Fees and Expenses

1031.Claimant claims total fees and expenses (including those for witnesses and experts
and its Hearing expenses) of USD 9,546,369.53 (see above para. 999).
Respondent’s total fees and expenses (including those for witnesses, experts,
translation and the Hearing) amount to USD 15,672,698.10 and EUR 28,852.50
(see above para. 1014).

1032. Both Parties claim that their fees and expenses are reasonable (Cl. Reply Cost.
20.01.2015, para. 7-9; Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 13-22). The question
whether or not this is the case can be left open in light of the Arbitral Tribunal’s
decision on the allocation of costs that will be taken further below (see below
para. 1046).

4. The Allocation of Costs

4.1 The Legal Basis

1033.The Arbitral Tribunal recalls that the relevant provision of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules with regards to the allocation of costs is Article 42:

1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such
costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

N

. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in
any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to
another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.

392

1034.

1035.

1036.

1037.

1038.

1039.

The Parties agree that, pursuant to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, costs
should be awarded “following the event”, with a discretion of the Arbitral
Tribunal to allocate costs differently based on the circumstances of the case
(Cl. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 4; Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 5-10; Resp.
Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 2).

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that this understanding is already reflected in the
wording of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The same
principle is also confirmed by the cases referred to by both Parties (Veteran
Petroleum v. Russia, para. 1867 et seq.; SwemBalt v. Latvia, para. 49; Tembec v.
United States, para. 139; Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic, para. 263).

As noted by Respondent, in cases where there is not a clear winner and loser, i.e.
where both parties prevail with regard to some of their claims and/or defenses, the
principle of “costs follow the event” requires that the costs be awarded taking into
account the parties’ relative success (Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic, para. 6;
Thunderbird v. Mexico, paras. 219 fol.; cf. Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 9).

Claimant’s submission concurs with this conclusion insofar as it was Claimant
who referred to Veteran Petroleum v. Russia and SwemBalt v. Latvia (Cl. Reply
Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 6).

As one of the circumstances that justify awarding costs differently than
“following the event”, a party that caused an unnecessary aggravation of costs
through its conduct in the proceedings (e.g. deficiencies in its presentation of the
case or obstructive behavior) may be required to bear costs in deviation from this
principle. This is confirmed by cases relied upon by Claimant (Romak v.
Uzbekistan, para.251; cf. Claim. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 4) and
Respondent (Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic, para. 265; cf. Resp. Cost
06.01.2015, para. 23).

The Arbitral Tribunal’s position is not altered by Claimant’s reference to EnCana
v. Ecuador (Claim. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 4), in which the arbitral tribunal
decided that it would be just and equitable for Respondent state to bear the costs
of the arbitration, with each party bearing its respective costs of representation
(EnCana v. Ecuador, para. 202). The Arbitral Tribunal sees no reason to draw
inferences from this decision on costs, given that it was rendered with explicit
reference to “the events giving rise to [that] proceeding” (idem) and that Claimant
has not substantiated in any way how the present case might be comparable to the
facts of EnCana. In any case, it was Claimant who emphasized that arbitral
tribunals should “consider the circumstances of each case individually and
apportion costs as appropriate” (Claim. Reply Cost. 20.01.2015, para. 3).

393

1040.

1041.

1042.

1043.

1044.

1045.

Considering the wording of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
and the cases discussed above, the Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that costs
should in principle be awarded “following the event”, i.e. taking into account the
parties’ relative success regarding their claims and defenses. In limited
circumstances, a party’s conduct during the proceedings such as deficiencies in its
presentation of the case or obstructive behavior may justify a deviation from that
principle.

4.2 The Application of the Principle to the Case at Hand

An application of the standard outlined above requires an assessment of the
Parties’ relative success regarding their claims and defenses.

In the present case, Respondent failed with its attempted jurisdictional defense
against Claimant’s standing (see above para. 81). In addition, the Arbitral
Tribunal also rejected Respondent’s further jurisdictional and admissibility
objections (see above para. 713). Claimant’s claims, however, were rejected for
their essential part (see above paras 303, 347, 382, 392, 400, 758, 828 and 842), as
were Respondent’s counterclaims (see above paras 959 and 974).

Taking a global view of the Parties’ respective success (or lack thereof) regarding
their claims and defenses, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that success and defeat
are equally distributed between the Parties of the case at hand. Accordingly, as the
most appropriate application of the principle that “costs follow the event”, the
Arbitral Tribunal decides that the Parties shall pay the Arbitral Tribunal’s fees and
expenses in equal shares, with each Party bearing its own fees and expenses
(including those for witnesses and experts).

This conclusion is also appropriate taking into account the circumstances that
gave rise to the present case: The Parties undertook and shared a significant risk.

Furthermore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is not justified to alter this
conclusion based on either Party’s conduct during the arbitration. Claimant and
Respondent each accused their respective counterparty of having rendered the
case unnecessarily complex and costly through its conduct (Cl. Reply Cost.
20.01.2015, para. 10-21; Resp. Cost. 06.01.2015, para. 23-29). To the extent that
complexity and costs of the case were unnecessarily aggravated by party conduct,
the Arbitral Tribunal considers that both Parties are responsible for such
aggravation. Accordingly, its decision regarding the distribution of costs taken
above remains unchanged by the Parties’ conduct in the arbitration.

394

Iv. Conclusion

1046.In conclusion, each Party shall pay half of the Arbitral Tribunal’s fees and
expenses and shall bear its own fees and expenses, including those for witnesses
and experts.

395

d.

AWARD

For the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal decides the following,
with the Arbitrator Hon. Marc Lalonde dissenting in part (see Annex 2):

Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections towards Claimant’s

AGF claims are unfounded and hereby rejected. Claimant’s AGF claims
are admissible and the Tribunal has jurisdiction thereover.

 

Respondent is liable for a breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT in connection
with the tax regime changes implemented in 2006 and in 2009.

3. Respondent owes an amount of USD 10,299,572 for the damage caused
by Respondent’s violation of Article 2(2) of the BIT with regard to the tax
law changes of 2006 and 2009.

4. Respondent shall pay an interest of LIBOR + 2% to be compounded
annually on the amount mentioned above. The interest rate shall be applied to
the loss suffered by Claimant as of the 31 December of each corresponding
year from 2004 to 2010.

The Arbitral Tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over Respondent’s
counter-claims.

Each Party shall pay half of the Arbitral Tribunal’s fees and expenses and
shall bear its own fees and expenses, including those for witnesses and

experts.

All other claims are rejected.
