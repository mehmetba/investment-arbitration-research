The PCA also acknowledges receipt of the Respondent’s Request for Correction dated 28 February
2014 wherein it requests three corrections to the Award, as well as Rurelec’s letter dated 2 March
2014 and e-mail of 3 March 2014 regarding to these requests.

Please find enclosed the corrected Award of the Tribunal, wherein the following corrections have
been made:

1.

The PCA has now received the Respondent’s deposit of USD 125,000. Accordingly, the
Tribunal has corrected paragraphs 621 and 622 as requested by the Respondent and agreed by
Rurelec.

The Tribunal has rejected the correction to paragraph 617 requested by the Respondent, given
that the discrepancy between the English and Spanish versions thereof resulted from a clerical
and typographical error to be corrected in the Spanish version and Annex A in order to match
the English version and the Tribunal’s decisions.

The Tribunal has accepted the corrections to subparagraphs 524(d) and (e) requested by the
Respondent.

The Tribunal has rejected the correction to paragraph 604 requested by the Respondent, given
that the non-application of inflation to the Tribunal’s CAPEX estimates is in accordance with
the Tribunal’s decisions.

The Tribunal has made various further clerical and typographical corrections to the Award on
its own initiative pursuant to Article 38(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

A copy of this letter in Spanish is enclosed.

Yours sincerely,

MCbLY

Martin Doe
Legal Counsel
