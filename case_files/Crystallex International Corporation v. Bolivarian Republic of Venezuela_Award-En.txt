OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’’) on the basis of the July 1996 Agreement
between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela
for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “BIT’’), which entered into force
on 28 January 1998, and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules as amended in April 2006.

The Claimant is Crystallex International Corporation and is hereinafter referred to as
“Crystallex” or the “Claimant.” Crystallex is represented in this arbitration by Messrs.
Nigel Blackaby, Lluis Paradell and Mrs. Caroline Richard, from the law firm
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP in Washington, D.C., Mr. Luis Guerrero, from
the law firm Wallis & Guerrero in Caracas, and Mr. Eduardo Travieso Uribe from the
law firm Travieso Evans Arria Rengel & Paz in Caracas.

The Claimant is a company incorporated under the laws of Canada.

The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is hereinafter referred to
as “Venezuela” or the “Respondent”. Venezuela is represented by Dr. Reinaldo
Enrique Mujfioz Pedroza, Viceprocurador General de la Reptiblica and, since 25
September 2011, by Dr. Ronald E.M. Goodman, Messrs. Paul S. Reichler and Alberto
Wray from the law firm Foley Hoag LLP, Washington, D.C. Before 25 September
2011, Venezuela was represented by (a) Mr. Paolo di Rosa and Ms. Gaela Gehring
Flores from the law firm Arnold & Porter LLP in Washington, D.C. and (b) Messrs.
Luis Torres Darias and Antonio Guerrero Araujo, from the law firm Torres Darias &
Asociados in Caracas.

The Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
“Parties”.

INTRODUCTION

The present dispute arises out of certain measures taken by Venezuela which, according
to the Claimant, have wrongfully affected the Claimant’s investment in the areas called
“Las Cristinas”. Las Cristinas is reported to contain one of the largest undeveloped gold
deposits in the world and is divided into four mining concessions, Cristina 4, 5, 6, and
7, which are located within the municipality of Sifontes in the State of Bolivar in the
Guayana region in southeast Venezuela. The Las Cristinas site borders the Cuyuni
River, is approximately 6 km west of the village of Las Claritas and 20 km from the
border of Guyana, and sits in the Imataca National Forest Reserve.

The Claimant contends that through its actions and omissions vis-a-vis Crystallex,
Venezuela has breached several of its obligations under the Agreement between the
Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the

Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “BIT” or the “Treaty”).! It particularly
points to Venezuela's April 2008 denial of a permit to Crystallex to exploit the gold
deposits at Las Cristinas, and of the rescission by the Corporacién Venezolana de
Guayana (the “CVG”), a state-run corporation tasked with stimulating economic
activity in the Guayana region, of the Mine Operation Contract (“MOC”) in February
2011.

This Section (Section I) provides a general recollection of the main facts underlying the
dispute. It only purports to put the dispute in its context, rather than to provide an
exhaustive description of all the events relevant for the dispute. Further factual
circumstances will be described in more detail when dealing with the Parties’ positions
(Section IV).

EARLY DEVELOPMENTS IN LAS CRISTINAS

The following paragraphs summarize the main developments in Las Cristinas which
occurred before Crystallex was involved in the site.

In 1964, the concession titles for Las Cristinas were issued to Ms. Dot Culver de Lemon
for a period of 25 years.? However, Ms. de Lemon did not carry out any industrial
mining operations at the site. According to the Claimant, from the early ‘80s a
significant number of illegal miners began working the gold deposits using techniques
that caused deforestation and pollution at Las Cristinas.? In 1986, the Cristinas 4 and 6
concessions were transferred to Inversora Mael C.A. (“Inversora Mael’’). This transfer
gave rise to litigation with the Ministry of Mines, which resulted in a 1991 Supreme
Court decision in favor of Inversora Mael.*

However, according to the Claimant competing rights over Las Cristinas ensued when
the Ministry of Mines, under Presidential Decree 1409 of 1990, empowered the CVG
to execute contracts with third parties for the exercise of mining rights in the Guayana
region of Venezuela.> On this basis, in June 1991, the CVG entered into a joint venture
with the Canadian mining company Placer Dome Inc. (“Placer Dome”) initially to
explore and, if economically feasible, produce gold at Las Cristinas. The newly
established company, Minera Las Cristinas, S.A. (“MINCA”) was owned 30% by the

CVG and 70% by Placer Dome.® The CVG and MINCA subsequently concluded a
contract to explore and exploit Las Cristinas for an initial period of 20 years.’ Despite
MINCA having later obtained all the necessary permits from the Ministry of Mines and
the Ministry of Environment, exploitation of the mines never commenced.*

12. On 2 March 1997, according to the Claimant, Crystallex purchased Inversora Mael for
a total purchase price of US$30 million, and asserted Inversora Mael’s competing rights
over Las Cristinas in Venezuelan courts.”

13. In July 2001, Placer Dome sold its shares in MINCA to the Canadian Company
Vannessa Ventures Ltd.!° The CVG and the Ministry of Mines refused to recognize the
transfer. In November 2001, the CVG terminated the MINCA contract, as a
consequence of which all rights over Las Cristinas reverted to the State.'!

14, On 29 April 2002, then President Hugo Chavez issued Decree 1757, whereby he
reserved to the Venezuelan State the exercise of mining activities at Las Cristinas,
declaring them as a matter of “priority for the Republic” and authorizing the Ministry
of Mines to contract with the CVG to that effect.!”

C. | THE CONCLUSION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENT AND MINE OPERATION
CONTRACT IN 2002

On 16 May 2002, the Ministry of Energy and Mines (the “Ministry of Mines”)'* and
the CVG entered into an agreement (the “Administrative Agreement between the
Ministry of Energy and Mines and the CVG with respect to Las Cristinas Deposits”,

'3 At the time that the Claimant entered into the MOC in September 2002, the Ministry of Mines was known as the
Minisiterio de Energia y Minas (Ministry of Energy and Mines). In 2005 it was reorganized as the Ministerio del
Poder Popular para las Industrias Basicas y Mineria (or “MIBAM” by its Spanish acronoym). In 2011, the
responsibility for mining policy was returned to the Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Energia y Petréleo and
is now part of the Ministerio del Poder Popular de Petréleo y Mineria. See Counter-Memorial, p. 3, fn. 4.

hereinafter the “Administrative Agreement”).'* The Administrative Agreement was
executed on the basis of Decree No. 1757 of 29 April 2002.!°

16. Pursuant to the Administrative Agreement, the Ministry of Mines “authorize[d] [the
CVG] to explore, exploit and sell the gold mineral found in the deposits located in the
areas of the concessions identified as Cristina 4, Cristina 5, Cristina 6 and Cristina 7, in
the municipality of Sifontes in the Bolivar State [...]”.'° It also authorized the CVG to
enter into contracts with third parties subject to prior notification to the Ministry of
Mines.!”

 

17. In May 2002, following the conclusion of the Administrative Agreement, the CVG met
with several companies, including Crystallex, to discuss the prospects of developing
Las Cristinas.'*

18. On 2 September 2002, the Board of Directors of the CVG approved the execution of
the future MOC with Crystallex.'!? On 17 September 2002, Crystallex and the CVG
concluded the MOC, which laid out the framework of rights and responsibilities of the
parties for the development of Las Cristinas.° Under the MOC, Crystallex was required
to bear all responsibility for the development of the Las Cristinas project and all of its
associated costs,”! proceed with the construction of the agreed social works”” and make
an initial payment of US$15 million, while being entitled to the proceeds deriving from
the sale of its gold production, subject to payment of a sliding royalty to the CVG and
all applicable taxes required under Venezuelan law.”

providing training programs and technical assistance to works from the local communities, developing and
completing various infrastructure works for the benefit of the local communities (ibid.). In addition, Crystallex was
to provide technical assistance, under the supervision of the CVG, to groups of small-scale miners present in the
Las Cristinas area in order to ensure good operating practice and a lower environmental impact. See MOC, Clause

19, For its part, the CVG assumed the obligations of, inter alia, securing the permits
required for the development of the project” and of issuing and processing all notices
to the Ministry of Mines required in connection to the MOC. According to Clause
17.4 of the MOC, “[t]he [CVG] shall be in charge of the formalities before the Ministry
of Environment and Natural Resources”.

20. The MOC provided for an initial duration of 20 years, which was extendable for two
10-year periods, for a maximum lifetime of 40 years.”°

D. THE PERMITTING PROCESS BETWEEN 2003 AND 2008

21. To start operating Las Cristinas, Crystallex?” had to obtain a number of authorizations
and permits from Venezuelan entities. In particular, it had to obtain an Authorization
to Affect Natural Resources (Autorizacién Para Afectar Recursos Naturales) from the
Ministry of Environment (the “AARN”, by its Spanish initials, or the “Permit”).’® The
following steps were necessary for the Permit to be granted:

a. Crystallex had to obtain a Land Occupation Permit issued by the Ministry of
Environment;7?

b. Crystallex had to prepare and submit a Feasibility Study for approval to the CVG
and the Ministry of Mines, setting out in detail a project that was geologically,
technically and financially sound;*°

c. Crystallex had to prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Study (“EIS”) to
the CVG for approval to the Ministry of Environment, which would address the
project’s effects on the environment.*!

*4 MOC, Exh. C-9, Clause 9.4.
5 MOC, Exh. C-9, Clause 9.5.
26 MOC, Exh. C-9, Clause 18.1.

27 For the sake of brevity, Crystallex will be referred to as the entity charged with obtaining various permits or
perform various tasks without recalling that the CVG is the concession-holder.

d. Crystallex had to post a construction compliance guarantee bond (the “Bond”)**
and pay certain environmental taxes.

1. The Land Occupation Permit

22. The Land Occupation Permit was originally obtained by the CVG from the Ministry of
Environment on 26 April 1993. Subsequently, the Ministry ratified its validity on 26
June 1997, 18 March 2002 and in August 2004.33

2. The Feasibility Study

23. In February 2003, Crystallex retained the mine engineering and geology consulting
firms SNC-Lavalin and Mine Development Associates (“MDA”) to prepare a technical,
economic and financial study (the “Feasibility Study”) for the Las Cristinas project, in
accordance with its obligation under clause 2.2 of the MOC.**

24. On 10 September 2003, Crystallex submitted the Feasibility Study to the CVG.*> The
report assumed an ore production rate of 20,000 tpd.*° On 7 October 2003, the CVG
requested additional information from Crystallex, including information on the water
deviation channel to control surface water and its possible influence on the neighboring
Las Brisas concessions, as well as the submission of a new EIS of the project in order
to comply with the current Venezuelan regulatory framework and Clause 9 of the
MOC.*”

25. During a meeting held on 29 October 2003, the CVG requested additional clarifications
of particular technical information. Crystallex informed the CVG that it believed it
could “substantially increase production in years 4 or 5 to 40,000 tonnes per day
reducing the mine life to 17 years”.*8 In addition, Crystallex confirmed, inter alia, that
the updated EIS would discuss the socio-economic impact of the project and outline the

26. On 4 December 2003, the CVG noted that the parties had agreed upon an initial
production rate of 20,000 tpd for the first three years, after which the project would
expand to accommodate 40,000 tpd.*”

27. On 19 December 2003, Crystallex submitted to the CVG a set of “Additional
Clarifications” (Aclaraciones Adicionales), illustrating its plans to increase production
from 20,000 to 40,000 tpd by year 8 of the project.*! On 9 January 2004, the CVG asked
Crystallex to state that it would expand to 40,000 tpd by year 4, instead of year 8.47 On
16 January 2004, Crystallex submitted Addendum | to the Feasibility Study, in which
it explained that for financing reasons, the Feasibility Study had to state that expansion
would occur in year 9, although it was likely that the expansion could happen earlier.*?
The same financing concerns underlying an expansion plan only as of year 9 were
reiterated by Crystallex in a letter to the CVG dated 5 February 2004.44

28. On 8 March 2004, the CVG approved the Feasibility Study,’° and on 15 April 2004 it
sent the document to the Ministry of Mines for its review and approval.*°

29. The Ministry of Mines made comments and requested changes to the Feasibility Study
by way of a letter to the CVG of 23 December 2004,*” which the CVG forwarded to
Crystallex on 5 January 2004.** Crystallex reportedly replied to those requests in
February 2005.”

questions, to which the CVG replied on 12 July 2004.°' On 20 July 2004, the CVG
contacted the Ministry of Environment to reiterate its request for approval of
Crystallex’s EIS. In the second half of 2004, Crystallex provided a number of
Addenda to the EIS, addressing the Ministry of Environment’s concerns,® as well as
an Environmental Supervision Plan (to be implemented during the construction phase
of the project).*

36. On 29 December 2004, the Ministry of Environment requested that the CVG and
Crystallex reformulate the project, noting that the study had been presented without
prior terms of reference. However, in early 2005, according to the Claimant, the newly
appointed Minister of Environment, Ms. Jacqueline Faria, expressed the position that
the project's existing terms of reference would remain in place, and scheduled a series
of workshops with Crystallex and the CVG in order to discuss the outstanding technical
issues.”

37. In March 2006, at the request of the Ministry of Environment, Crystallex resubmitted
all of the documentation related to the approval of the EIS. In February and April

E. THE DENIAL OF THE PERMIT IN APRIL 2008

44, On 14 April 2008, the Director General of the Administrative Office of Permissions of
the Ministry of Environment informed the CVG that the request for the Permit was
denied.”° The reasons put forward by the Ministry of Environment included concerns
for the environment and the indigenous peoples of the Imataca Forest Reserve.

45. According to the Claimant, the CVG received the Permit denial on 28 April 2008, and
informally made Crystallex aware of that decision on the same day.’” Crystallex
formally acknowledged its awareness of that decision on 5 May 2008.’

46. On 12 May 2008, Crystallex formally asked that the Permit request be reconsidered by
filing a motion for reconsideration (Recurso do Reconsideracién) before the Director
General of the Office of Permits of the Ministry of Environment.”? On 28 May 2008,
the Ministry of Environment declared Crystallex’s motion for reconsideration
inadmissible, on the basis that Crystallex lacked standing to file the appeal.*? The
Director General also reaffirmed his rejection of the CVG’s application for the Permit.
Crystallex appealed the Director General’s ruling on 17 June 2008, by means of a
hierarchical appeal (Recurso Jerdrquico) to the Minister of Environment.*! It is
undisputed between the Parties that the Minister of Environment did not rule on the
appeal, although the Parties disagree on the legal implications of such omission.

49. In response to Crystallex’s report of 4 August 2008, the Ministry of Environment
informed Crystallex on 20 August 2008 that:

“[...] having fully studied the body of ideas proposed in the aforementioned
document, which tend to adhere to Government guidelines in both
environmental and social matters, this Office considers the evaluation by our
technicians to be useful in making a decision regarding whether to take on

the “Las Cristinas” Gold Project”.

50. However, on 19 September 2008, President Chavez stated in a public address that:
“In Guayana for example, we are taking back big mines, and one of them is
one of the biggest in the world. And do you know what it is? It’s gold, it’s

gold!"

51. On 5 November 2008, the Minister of Mines, Mr. Rodolfo Sanz, expressed the intention
to nationalize Las Cristinas:

“[...] by 2009, the State will take back, operate and manage the Las Cristinas
mine, previously owned by Cristalex [sic], an international company”.*®

 

52. Further, according to a 6 November 2008 report by Reuters, Minister Sanz announced
that Venezuela would sign an agreement with Rusoro Mining Ltd. (“Rusoro”), a
Russian-managed mining company, to build and operate a mine at Las Cristinas
through a joint venture with the Venezuelan Government.*’ Minister Sanz added that:
“Tw]e have to rescind our relationship with a company that has been working in the
zone. We have a legal problem there”.®*

53. On 24 November 2008, after having written a number of letters to the Ministry of
Mines,*® Crystallex notified the Ministry of Mines of a dispute under the Treaty

54, On 13 January 2009, in his annual message to the National Assembly, President Chavez
announced that:

“[T]his year the Venezuelan State has taken over the exploitation and control
of the gold deposits of Las Cristinas at kilometer 88 in the State of Bolivar;
one of the largest gold deposits on the American continent. Cristinas is
estimated to have approximately 35.2 million ounces of gold, that is 1,094
metric tons of estimated reserves. Of this reserve, 24.5 million ounces, or 762
tons, are classified as proven.

In this way, the Venezuelan State controls 30,000 million dollars, which is
the current estimated worth of the deposit. Currently, 30 thousand. The Las
Cristinas concessions are organized into five parts: Cristina IV, Cristina V,
Cristina VI, Cristina VII and Brisas del Cuyuni. They are under the control
of socialism, for the development of economic growth for the national
development.

L.]

In mining we have created this year (2008) the mixed company Venris, with
Russia, a Russian company and a Venezuelan company, a mixed company
for the deposits of Las Cristinas [...]”.°!

55. On 26 February 2009, Crystallex sought information from the CVG regarding the status
of the MOC,” in response to which the CVG sent the following letter on 2 March 2009:

“Taking into account that the normative act that gave origin to the operations
contract [MOC] has not been revoked or replaced, and that the contract is
valid for 20 years and that Crystallex has been fulfilling the obligations
assumed with the contract, we hereby inform you that the contract is fully
valid and in the process of obtaining the required permits from the competent
authorities for the development of the Project”.”

56. On 25 April 2010, according to the transcript of the President’s weekly television
address, “A16 Presidente’, President Chavez stated, inter alia, that:

“Tf we are going to exploit gold, we will have to nationalize all of it,
recuperate and put an end to concessions, which led to degeneration [...]”.°*

In response to a request from Crystallex dated 20 July 2010, the CVG informed
Crystallex on 15 August 2010 that:

“[...] Given that the contract [MOC] has a duration of twenty (20) years and
that the administrative act underlying the contract has not been replaced or
repealed, it is clear that the same contract remains in full force and effect.”>

On 17 October 2010, the Agencia Venezolana de Noticias (State news agency) reported
that President Chavez made the following statement during his visit in Belarus:

“Las Cristinas, this mine belongs to Venezuela and it has been handed over
to transnational companies, I announce to the world that the revolutionary

Government recuperated it, together with the Las Brisas mine. These mineral

resources are for the Venezuelan people, not for transnationals”.”*

THE CVG’s RESCISSION OF THE MOC AND CRYSTALLEX'S INITIATION OF
ARBITRATION IN FEBRUARY 2011

On 3 February 2011, the CVG informed Crystallex that it was rescinding the MOC.
The CVG's resolution stated that the CVG had decided to “unilaterally rescind for
reasons of opportunity and convenience, the [MOC] [...] due to the cessation of
activities for more than one (1) year, in accordance with Clause Twenty-four [of the
Moc]”.””

On 11 February 2011, Crystallex informed the CVG that it considered the CVG's
resolution of 3 February 2011 to be null and that it was waiving its right to exercise a
Petition for Reconsideration of the resolution, without prejudice to the rights it could
assert in an arbitration proceeding under the Treaty.”*

On 16 February 2011, Crystallex filed a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela with
the ICSID Secretariat.”

with Articles 4 and 5 of the Arbitration Rules and notified the Parties of the registration.
In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to
constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with Rule 5(e) of the
Arbitration Rules.

By letters dated 10 and 13 June 2011, the Parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal would
consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third arbitrator
and President of the Tribunal to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. The
appointment of the President of the Tribunal would be through a ballot method if the
Parties did not reach an agreement within 14 days or agreed extension. If the ballot
method did not render a result, the President of the Tribunal would be appointed
pursuant to Article 10 of the Arbitration Rules.

On 14 June 2011, following his appointment by the Claimant, Professor John Y.
Gotanda, a national of the United States of America, accepted his appointment as
arbitrator. On 15 June 2011, following his appointment by the Respondent, Justice
Florentino Feliciano, a national of the Philippines, accepted his appointment as
arbitrator. On 4 October 2011, following his appointment by the Parties, Dr. Laurent
Lévy, a national of Brazil and Switzerland, accepted his appointment as presiding
arbitrator.

In accordance with Article 13 of the Arbitration Rules, on 5 October 2011, the
Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their
appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on
that date. Ms. Ann Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve
as Secretary of the Tribunal.

Pursuant to Article 21(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on 25 October 2011 the Parties
agreed to hold the First Session outside of the 60-day period. The Parties submitted a
joint letter with their comments on the agenda of the First Session on 18 November
2011.

The Tribunal held a First Session with the Parties on 1 December 2011 in Washington,
D.C. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal,
present at the First Session were:

The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It
was agreed inter alia that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from
10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that
the place of arbitration would be Washington, D.C., U.S.A.

The agreements of the Parties and decisions of the Tribunal were embodied in the
Minutes of the First Session signed by the President and circulated to the Parties on 5
January 2012.

As agreed at the first session, on 10 February 2012, the Claimant filed a Memorial on
the Merits (“Memorial”).

RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR BIFURCATION

On 2 April 2012, the Respondent filed a request to address the objections to jurisdiction
as a preliminary question.

On 6 April 2012, the Tribunal established a date for the filing of the Claimant’s reply
and declared the proceeding on the merits suspended as of the date of the submission
of the request for bifurcation and until a decision had been made by the Tribunal on the
request.

On 23 April 2012, the Claimant filed its reply, and on 26 April 2012 and 2 May 2012,
the Parties exchanged further observations on the Respondent’s request.

On 23 May 2012, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Bifurcation, rejecting the
Respondent’s request to address the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question.
As a result, the Tribunal dismissed all other prayers for relief and reserved the decision
on costs for this Award. The Tribunal further lifted the suspension of the proceedings,

proposed a new procedural calendar and confirmed the dates of the hearing on
jurisdiction and the merits.

MERITS PHASE

On 8 June 2012, the Parties proposed a revised procedural calendar, which was
confirmed by the Tribunal on 14 June 2012.

On 4 September 2012, the Claimant submitted a request for the Tribunal to decide on
Venezuela’s document production request, pursuant to section 14 of the Minutes of the
First Session. On 7 September 2012, the Respondent submitted further comments on
its reply to the Claimant’s objections to Respondent’s document production request.
On 10 September 2012, the Claimant objected to Respondent’s further comments as
they were not agreed in the Minutes of the First Session. This exchange was further
commented by the Respondent and the Claimant on the same date.

On 17 September 2012, the Tribunal indicated that its decision would be based on the
Parties’ exchanges of 6, 16, 23 August and 4 September 2012, which reflected the
process envisaged by the Minutes of the First Session. On 24 September 2012, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 ruling on the Respondent’s request for
document production.

On 9 October 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had reached an
agreement to amend the procedural calendar. On 11 October 2012, the Tribunal
confirmed the amendment to the procedural calendar agreed by the Parties.

On 5 November 2012, the Respondent submitted a request for the Tribunal to decide
on a request for document production from the Claimant, pursuant to section 14.1(d) of
the Minutes of the First Session. On 12 November 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 2, deciding on the Claimant’s request for document production.

In accordance with the amended schedule agreed by the Parties and confirmed by the
Tribunal, on 21 November 2012, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction and the Merits (“Counter-Memorial”).

On 26 November 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of difficulties in
producing certain documents in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2. Following
comments from the Claimant, on 29 November 2012, the Tribunal ordered the
Respondent to produce the documents on a rolling basis and to propose a reasonable
time limit for that purpose. The Respondent explained that some documents contained
confidentiality provisions that did not allow for their disclosure, and indicated that it
would request authorization to disclose from the third party that had executed them.
Following instructions from the Tribunal, on 3 December 2012, the Claimant requested
a procedural order (i) guaranteeing the confidentiality of the documents and (ii)
ordering Venezuela to complete the disclosure by 7 December 2012.

After numerous exchanges, on 21 December 2012, the Parties submitted the final
agreed text of the confidentiality terms. On 28 December 2012, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 3 concerning confidentiality terms for the production of
documents ordered in Procedural Order No. 2.

On 23 January 2013, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to
disclose unredacted versions and other documents ordered under Procedural Order No.
2. On 29 January 2013, the Respondent indicated that it had continued efforts to obtain
the consent for disclosure of the documents. On the basis of this information, on 1
February 2013 the Tribunal set a deadline for the Respondent to produce the documents
ordered in Procedural Order No. 2. On 4 February 2013, the Respondent informed the
Tribunal that all requested documents in Venezuela’s possession, custody, or control
had been produced and delivered to the Claimant, as stated in its communication of 31
January 2013.

On 6 February 2013, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order Venezuela to: (a)
confirm whether the Development Consulting Agreement, the Engineering
Procurement and Construction Contract, the Project Financing and any other
documents responsive to the Tribunal’s disclosure order relating to the Claimant’s
document production request were in the possession, custody or control of certain
government-related third parties; and to (b) disclose any documents responsive to the
Tribunal’s disclosure order relating to the Claimant’s document request. On 12
February 2013, the Respondent confirmed that it had complied with the Tribunal’s
instructions contained in Procedural Order No. 2.

On 11 February 2013, the Respondent forwarded to the Tribunal the Parties’ exchanges
with respect to the Claimant's second document production request, and requested that
the Tribunal rule upon the outstanding objections in accordance with Section 14.1 of
the Minutes of the First Session. On 18 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 4 on the Claimant’s second document production request.

On 22 April 2013, the Parties agreed to an amendment to the procedural calendar, which
was confirmed by the Tribunal on 24 April 2013.

On 20 May 2013, the Parties informed the Tribunal of certain procedural agreements
concerning the hearing. On 23 May 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’
agreements and established the procedural calendar for the remainder of the proceeding.

On 9 May 2013, the Claimant filed its Reply on jurisdiction and the merits (“Reply”).
On 10 September 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the pre-hearing conference call.

On 13 September 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Respondent had
not produced certain documents ordered in Procedural Order No. 2 and requested the
Tribunal to order the Respondent to produce a list of documents included in its letter
together with any other documents responsive to Procedural Order No. 2. On 20
September 2013, the Respondent indicated that it had produced in good faith the
documents initially requested by the Claimant. It also indicated that the specific

documents referred to by the Claimant in its letter had also been produced and provided
further reasons as to why other documents had not been produced.

On 18 September 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the
Merits (“Rejoinder’).

On 27 September 2013, the Claimant submitted comments to Venezuela’s response of
20 September 2013 and requested that the Tribunal order Venezuela to disclose
immediately and, at any rate, no later than 4 October 2013 a number of documents in
the possession, custody or control of Venezuela. On 30 September 2013, the
Respondent requested the Tribunal to reject the Claimant’s submission of 27 September
2013. The Respondent further argued that it had already complied with Procedural
Order No. 2 and that the Claimant’s list of documents constituted a new request to
which the Respondent requested leave to reply to. On 1 October 2013, the Claimant
confirmed that it had no further comments to its 27 September 2013 letter.

On 30 September 2013, the Parties filed their requests for witnesses and experts to be
made available for cross-examination at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits.

On 1 October 2013, the President of the Tribunal inquired whether the Parties would
agree to Dr. Michele Potesta’s appointment as an Assistant to the Tribunal in this case.
On 4 October 2013, both Parties agreed to Dr. Potesta’s appointment. On 8 October
2013, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement and on 14 October 2013, the
Centre circulated to the Parties Dr. Potesta’s signed declaration.

On 4 October 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 regarding the latest
document production request formulated by the Claimant.

HEARING ON JURISDICTION AND THE MERITS

On 7 October 2013, the Parties submitted a joint procedural proposal for the hearing
and indicated that they would provide their respective views on the points of conflict
separately on 14 October 2013.

On 8 October 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement and asked the Parties
to indicate whether any additional items should be added to the agenda for the pre-
hearing conference call.

On 11 October 2013, the Parties submitted further explanations regarding the issues
where they had been unable to reach an agreement.

On 17 October 2013, the President of the Tribunal, the Assistant to the Tribunal, the
Secretary of the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing conference call in English
and Spanish. The Parties were represented by:

On 18 October 2013, the Claimant submitted new exhibits pursuant to section 3.3 of
Procedural Order No. 5, which were admitted by the Tribunal into the record on 4
November 2013.

On 23 October 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning procedural
matters relating to the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits.

On 28 October 2013, the Parties submitted their respective lists of the witnesses they
intended to examine regarding new issues not covered by their statements but directly
related to the dispute and in which those witnesses had personal involvement pursuant
to Section 6.3 of Procedural Order No. 6. The Respondent’s communication also
included a list of new exhibits (R-161 to R-182) pursuant to Section 7.3 of Procedural
Order No. 6.

On the same date, the Claimant submitted a list of additional exhibits and legal
authorities responsive to the Respondent’s Rejoinder pursuant to Section 7.3 of
Procedural Order No. 6. The Claimant also presented a list of exhibits, originally
submitted by the Respondent in excerpted form, for which the Claimant submitted
additional excerpts or the full document.

On 5 November 2013, the Respondent filed objections to the new exhibits submitted
by the Claimant. On 29 October 2013, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s
submission of new exhibits. On 30 October 2013, the Respondent indicated that

21

108.

109.

110.

Procedural Order No. 6 did not limit the presentation of new exhibits to one party and
it would seek leave from the Tribunal to enter these exhibits into the record
independently of Procedural Order No. 6. On 31 October 2013, the Respondent filed
an amended list of exhibits. On 31 October 2013, the Claimant replied to the
Respondent’s arguments. On 4 November 2013, the Respondent filed its response. On
5 November 2013, the Tribunal issued its decision regarding the new exhibits.

By letter of 5 November 2013, the Claimant requested the introduction of certain
translations of documents as new exhibits. On 6 November 2013, the Respondent
objected to the introduction of the translations. On the same date the Tribunal issued a
decision on this issue.

On 4 November 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr. José Salamat
Khan Fernandez was not going to be able to travel to Washington, D.C. for the hearing
due to health concerns and as a result of his high level position at the Venezuelan
government, which would not allow him to travel for long periods of time. The
Respondent indicated that Mr. Khan Fernandez would be made available for
examination through videoconference. On 5 November 2013, the Tribunal granted
leave to examine Mr. Khan Fernandez by videoconference.

A hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place in Washington, D.C. in November
2013. Although the hearing had originally been scheduled to take place from 11
November 2013 to 22 November 2013, the proceeding was suspended on November
19, 2013 as a consence of the events described infra. In addition to the Members of the
Tribunal, the Assistant to the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the
hearing were:

RECONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL AND CONTINUATION OF THE HEARING ON
JURISDICTION AND THE MERITS

On 18 November 2013, the Respondent filed before the Secretary-General a proposal
for the disqualification of Justice Florentino Feliciano, pursuant to Articles 14 and 15
of the Arbitration Rules. Since the proposal was filed during the hearing, the
Respondent requested that the hearing be immediately suspended pursuant to Article
15(7).

By letter dated 19 November 2013, the Secretary-General declared the proceeding
suspended until a decision had been taken with respect to the proposal for the
disqualification of Justice Feliciano. On the same date, the two unchallenged arbitrators
established the calendar of submissions regarding the challenge.

On 5 December 2013, Justice Feliciano submitted his resignation to the Secretary-
General. His resignation was transmitted to the Parties and the other two Members of
the Tribunal on 9 December 2013. Pursuant to Article 14(3) of the Arbitration Rules,
the reasons for Justice Feliciano’s resignation were considered by the Tribunal, which
consented thereto on 11 December 2013. The proceeding remained suspended pursuant
to Article 16(2) of the Arbitration Rules.

On 15 December 2013, the Respondent appointed Professor Laurence Boisson de
Chazournes, a national of France, as arbitrator pursuant to Articles 14(3) and 17(1) of
the Arbitration Rules.

On 19 December 2013, Professor Boisson de Chazournes accepted her appointment.
The Tribunal was reconstitutued and the proceeding resumed in accordance with
Article 18 of the Arbitration Rules.

On 23 December 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, given the short time
between the appointment of Prof. Boisson de Chazournes and the date for the envisaged
continuation of the hearing, Prof. Boisson de Chazournes envisaged the possibility to
retain an assistant for the purpose of the preparation of the hearing. The Claimant and
the Respondent consented to the appointment of such assistant on 24 December and 27
December 2013 respectively. It subsequently turned out that such support was
eventually not needed.

On 8 January 2014, the Tribunal confirmed that the procedural directions issued in
relation to the November 2013 hearing would remain applicable to the continuation of
the hearing, subject to some amendments. On 17 January 2014, the Parties submitted
their comments to the amendments. On 22 January 2014, having considered the Parties’

25

comments, the Tribunal issued the final amended procedural directions, which were
included as an amendment to Annex A to Procedural Order No. 6.

The continuation of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place in Washington,
D.C. from 16 February to 19 February 2014. In addition to the Members of the
Tribunal, the Assistant to the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the

hearing were:

Transcripts of the hearing were distributed to the Parties. Audio recordings of the
hearing in English and Spanish were also sent to the Parties.

On 19 February 2014, the Respondent sought leave to amend footnote 239 on page 79
of the Environmental and Social Expert Report of OptiTech Engineering Solutions Inc.
of November 21, 2012 (First ER OptiTech) which was an issue that had been raised
during the examination of Mr. Luke Danielson. On 21 February 2014, pursuant to the
instructions provided by the Tribunal at the hearing, the Claimant submitted its
observations to the amendment of the First ER OptiTech. On 27 February 2014, the
Respondent replied to the Claimant’s observations. On 28 February 2014, the Tribunal
confirmed that the First ER OptiTech had been amended to reflect the correct citations
as set forth in the Respondent’s letter of 19 February 2014, and provided another
deadline to the Parties to comment. The Parties did not further comment on this issue.

On 4 March 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted a set of questions from the
Tribunal for the Parties to address in their post-hearing submissions pursuant to the
instructions provided at the hearing. The questions were not meant to be exhaustive
but rather to point to some areas that required additional clarification from the Parties.
The questions were as follows:

28

2)

3)

4)

5)

6)

7)

8)

Assuming that the Tribunal would not have jurisdiction over the claims
arising directly from the rescission of the MOC (under either or both
jurisdictional objections put forward by the Respondent), what would be
the consequences, if any, on the prayers for relief, on the awards, on the
valuation date, and especially on the amounts to be awarded?

The Tribunal understands that the Claimant has withdrawn its claim for
restitution (Hearing Transcript, 11 November 2013, 205:14-18; 255:15-
18). If this understanding is erroneous, the Tribunal invites the Claimant
to clarify its position.

If the Tribunal were to conclude that Minister Khan did not have the
authority to rescind the MOC, would the consequences be that the
rescission is not valid? Would that mean that it produces no effects? If
yes (to either of the two preceding questions in this paragraph), what
would be the consequences of that invalid rescission under Venezuelan
law, if relevant, and under international law?

Which were the rights of the Claimant (exploration, exploitation,
occupation, development etc.) under the MOC at the time of the permit
denial in 2008, and until the rescission of the MOC in 2011?

At what time(s) did the Claimant’s alleged legitimate expectations arise?

Assuming that the Tribunal were to find liability under one of the
Treaty’s standards of treatment (expropriation, fair and equitable
treatment, etc.), would it then have to analyze whether the other Treaty
standards have also been breached? If yes, why?

How should the relationship between the fair and equitable treatment and
the full protection and security standards be understood in the context of
Article 2.2 of the Treaty?

What is the standard of compensation applicable in this case for Treaty
breaches other than expropriation? What would result (in figures) from
the application of that standard?

29

125.

9)

10)

11)

12)

On 18 March 2014, the Claimant raised certain difficulties regarding Tribunal’s
question 9. On 4 April 2014, the Respondent filed its comments and noted that it

Assuming the Tribunal were to find liability under one or more of the
Treaty’s standards of treatment, what would the Claimant’s damages be
under the various approaches set forth by Claimant, other than the stock
market approach, if:

(i) The date of valuation is (a) April 13, 2008 or (b) February
3, 2011;

(ii) The price of gold is (a) $629, or $650, or $925, in the case
of a valuation date of April 13, 2008, or (b) $1,039, or
$1,100, or $1,328, in the case of a valuation date of
February 3, 2011;

(iii) The duration is 20 years (assume no renewals);

(iv) The extraction rate is 20,000 tpd moving to 40,000 tpd in
year 3; and

(iv) The implied nominal discount rate is (a) 10.41%, or (b)
12.71%, or (c) 15%, or (d) 17%, or 22%?

Assuming that the Tribunal were to find liability under one or more of
the Treaty’s standards of treatment and were to use a stock market
approach, would it have all the needed figures (metrics, relevant stock
prices)? If so, what would the Claimant’s damage be applying a stock
market approach, assuming: (a) a stock price from June 14, 2007, (b) a
control premium of 20% or, in the alternative, no control premium, (c)
applying the permitting bump (as set forth by Claimant) or, in the
alternative, excluding a permitting bump, (d) applying the rate of growth
in benchmark industry indices as set forth by Claimant, and (e) a
valuation date of April 13, 2008, or in the alternative, February 3, 2011.

Assuming that the Tribunal were to find liability under one or more of
the Treaty’s standards of treatment and were to use a cost approach, could
the Parties provide the actual amounts spent and evaluate their
contribution to value?

Assuming the Tribunal were to find liability under one or more of the
Treaty’s standards of treatment and award damages, please explain why
or why not the $37.4 million received from mitigation efforts should be
deducted from any damages owed to Claimant?

needed to address with new evidence or analysis some of the issues contained in the
Claimant’s letter of 18 March 2014. Therefore, the Respondent reserved its rights to
provide supplemental comments to the Claimant’s responses to the extent that such
answers implied a new damages analysis or new evidence. On 7 April 2014, the
Tribunal instructed the Parties to first seek leave from the Tribunal before making
submissions on the referred issue, whether before or after the post-hearing briefs
(“PHB”). In compliance with the Tribunal’s direction, on 8 April 2014, the Claimant
indicated that it also reserved its rights to comment on (a) the valuation date; and (b)
the evidence on the record with respect to the value of the Claimant’s interest in Las
Cristinas depending on the valuation date used.

On 28 March 2014, the Parties submitted the final agreed corrected transcripts of the
hearing, in accordance with section 17 of Annex A to Procedural Order No. 6 (as
amended).

On 2 May 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to an extension
to file the post-hearing briefs. On 5 May 2014, the Tribunal confirmed the extension
agreed by the Parties.

The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 12 May 2014.

On 10 June 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to strike from the record
alleged new evidence, arguments and valuations presented in the Claimant’s Post-
Hearing Brief, to which the Claimant replied on 11 June 2014. On 13 June 2014, the
Tribunal invited the Respondent to indicate the precise paragraphs or sentences from
the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief that it wished to have stricken from the record and
the Claimant to subsequently indicate which of the identified section it objected to. The
Parties submitted the requested information in their respective letters of 20 and 27 June
2014. On 30 June 2014, the Respondent submitted further comments on this matter.

FURTHER QUANTUM INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE TRIBUNAL AND HEARING ON
QUANTUM

On 25 July 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file one further round of
submissions with related evidence and expert reports, if needed, subject to certain
limitations. In doing so, the Tribunal specified that it did not wish to receive additional
evidence that was not strictly related to the questions raised in the Tribunal’s letter of
25 July 2014. In particular, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide a submission
addressing the following questions with related evidence and expert reports, to be
followed by the Respondent’s submission with related evidence and expert reports, if
needed:

1. To supply the necessary data and the calculations in relation to the
P/NAV method, assuming:

31

(i) The date of valuation is 13 April 2008;

(ii) The price of gold is (a) $629, or (b) $650, or (c) $925;

(iii) The duration is (a) 20 years or (b) 40 years;

(iv) The extraction rate is 20,000 tpd moving to 40,000 tpd in year 3; and

(v) The implied nominal discount rate is (a) 10.41%, or (b) 12.71%, or
(c) 15%, or (d) 17%, or (e) 22%.

2. To supply the necessary data and the calculations in relation to the
market multiples method, assuming:

(i) The date of valuation is (a) 13 April 2008 or (b) 3 February 2011;
(ii) A control premium of 20% or, in the alternative, no control premium;
(iii) The duration is (a) 20 years or (b) 40 years;

(iv) The extraction rate is 20,000 tpd moving to 40,000 tpd in year 3
(assume no “unconstrained” scenario).

3. To supply the necessary data and the calculations in relation to the
stock market approach:

(i) Assuming the date of valuation is (a) 13 April 2008 or (b) 3 February
2011;

(ii) Assuming a stock price from 14 June 2007;

(iii) Assuming a control premium of 20% or, in the alternative, no control
premium;

(iv) Applying the permitting bump (as set forth by the Claimant) or, in
the alternative, excluding a permitting bump;

(v) Using the Market Vectors Junior Gold Mining Index (Exh. CLEX-
96) to project the growth of Crystallex’s share price to (a) 13 April 2008
or (b) 3 February 2011.

4. To update and provide any further supporting document in relation to
the cost approach, in particular any supporting evidence of net costs (i.e.,
costs from which the damage claim would flow) incurred until 2014.

5. To correct its request for relief set forth in paragraph 749 of its post-
hearing brief. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, the Tribunal
believes that there is a need to correct some typographical or clerical
errors and is directing the Claimant only to correct such typographical or
clerical errors, if indeed there are any.

On 14 August 2014, the Respondent raised concerns regarding the Tribunal’s 25 July
2014 request for further quantum information and requested that the Tribunal withdraw
its request and allow it to comment on the Claimant’s submitted new calculation on the
cost approach. On 15 August 2014, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment on
Respondent’s 14 August 2014 communication, which the Claimant did on the same
date and also requested an extension to file its response to the Tribunal’s 25 July 2014
request for further quantum information. On 17 August 2014, the Respondent reiterated
its request to the Tribunal. On 18 August 2014, the Tribunal decided to reaffirm its
request from 25 July 2014 and extended the deadlines for the Parties to submit their
responses.

On | September 2014, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal hold a hearing after
the submissions of the Parties in response to the Tribunal’s 25 July 2014 request for
further quantum information. On 4 September 2014, the Claimant requested an
extension to submit its comments. On 5 September 2014, the Tribunal granted
Claimant’s request and indicated the dates in which the Tribunal would be available for
a possible hearing, without prejudice to its decision regarding the Respondent’ s request.
On 7 September 2014, the Claimant submitted its comments. On 8 September 2014,
the Tribunal decided (a) to hold a short hearing limited to the examination of experts
on quantum; and (b) that no further submissions were required beyond the ones
contemplated.

On 12 September 2014, the Claimant submitted its Supplemental Submission on
Quantum and Compass Lexecon’s Responses to the Tribunal’s Questions dated 25 July
2014. On 15 September 2014, the Claimant submitted a revised version of Compass
Lexecon’s Responses to the Tribunal’s Questions dated 25 July 2014.

On 18 September 2014, Professor Boisson de Chazournes informed the Parties that she
had acquired Swiss nationality.

On 31 October 2014, the Respondent filed its Supplemental Submission on Quantum
and the Third Expert Report of Timothy H. Hart of Credibility International.

On 9 October 2014, the Claimant submitted the award in the case Gold Reserve Inc. v.
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1) as a new legal
authority. Further to this submission, the Claimant also requested leave from the
Tribunal for both Parties to submit a brief analysis of key elements in the
aforementioned award. On 10 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to
submit its comments to the Claimant’s request by 14 October 2014. The Respondent
requested an extension to the deadline, which was granted by the Tribunal.

On 15 October 2014, the Respondent submitted its comments to the specific elements
raised by the Claimant in its 9 October 2014 letter and also submitted the award in the
case Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd.,
Mobil Venezolana de Petrdleos Holdings, Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., and Mobil

Venezolana de Petréleos, Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No.
ARB/07/27) as a new legal authority in this case.

On 16 October 2014, the Claimant replied to the Respondent’s comments and reiterated
its request for an exchange of brief submissions. On the same date, the Respondent
addressed the Claimant’s request for brief submissions and suggested that such
submissions be filed after the hearing scheduled for November 2014.

On 17 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit brief comments on the
two new legal authorities and reminded the Parties that the scheduled hearing was to be
solely for the limited purpose of examining the Parties’ experts on quantum. On the
same date, the Respondent requested an extension of the deadline to submit its brief
comments.

On 20 November 2014, the Tribunal indicated that it did not see the need to extend the
deadline but that it could reconsider the Respondent’s request once it had received the
brief comments from the Claimant.

On 31 October 2014, the Claimant submitted its comments on the new legal authorities.

On 6 November 2014, the Respondent reiterated its request for an extension and noted
that the Claimant was making new arguments with respect to the new legal authorities.
On 7 November 2014, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s characterization of
its comments but did not object to the extension.

On 10 November 2014, the Respondent filed its brief comments on the new legal
authorities pursuant to the Tribunal’s granted extension.

On 23 September 2014, the Parties submitted agreed procedural rules for the hearing
on quantum.

On 25 September 2014, the Tribunal issued the final procedural rules for the hearing.
On 7 November 2014, the Tribunal issued revised final procedural rules for the hearing.

On 20 November 2014, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to rule on its request for
leave to submit additional factual exhibits into the record in accordance with paragraph
16 of the updated procedural rules. On the same date, the Respondent objected to the
Claimant’s new documents. The Claimant’s request was rejected by the Tribunal on
the same day.

On 22 November 2014, the hearing on further information on quantum took place in
Paris. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal, the Assistant to the Tribunal and the
Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were:

On 26 November 2014, the Secretariat dispatched an electronic copy of the audio and
transcripts of the hearing in English and Spanish.

On 15 December 2014, the Parties sent the final agreed corrected transcript of the
hearing on quantum.

On 21 January 2015, the Respondent informed the Secretariat of changes to the contact
list in the arbitration. On 22 January 2015, the Secretariat inquired as to the contact
person to whom all communications should be addressed within the Attorney General’s
office. On that same date, the Respondent informed the Secretariat that all
communications should be addressed to Dr. Reinaldo Enrique Mufioz Pedroza,
Viceprocurador General de la Republica.

On 23 January 2015, the Secretariat informed the Parties that, following the decision of
Ms. Ann Catherine Kettlewell to leave her position at ICSID, the Secretary-General
had appointed Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, as Secretary of the
Tribunal in this case.

The Parties filed their submissions on costs on 23 January 2015.

On 26 June 2015, the President of the Tribunal disclosed to the Parties his recent
appointment as President in two separate arbitrations in which Freshfields acted as
counsel for one of the parties, one of which arbitrations involved three state-owned
Venezuelan entities as respondents. The President indicated that he did not consider
that these facts affected his independence and impartiality and noted that the disclosure
was made for the sake of transparency only.

On 29 June 2015, the Respondent asked the President of the Tribunal to identify certain
specifics about one of the arbitrations to which he had referred in his communication
of 26 June 2015. On | July 2015, the President of the Tribunal provided to the Parties
the information requested by the Respondent in its communication of 29 June 2015.

The proceeding was closed on December 24, 2015.

PRELIMINARY MATTER: VENEZUELA’S PROCEDURAL OBJECTIONS

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal addresses certain procedural and due process
objections made by the Respondent during the proceedings. The Tribunal finds it
important to put those objections within the context in which they were made and to
underscore the subsequent developments that followed those objections.

On 2 June 2014, the Respondent sought leave from the Tribunal to provide comments
to the Claimant’s PHB and its Annex I, which according to the Respondent contained
“new and misleading arguments largely based on documents not found in the
evidentiary record”. Further letters on this issue were received on 9 and 11 June 2014
from the Claimant and on 10 June 2014 from the Respondent respectively.

On 13 June 2014, the Tribunal took note that in its 10 June 2014 letter, Venezuela had
requested the Tribunal to strike from the record the allegedly new evidence, arguments
and valuations presented in the Claimant’s PHB. The Tribunal invited the Respondent
to indicate by 20 June 2014 the precise paragraphs or sentences from the Claimant’s
PHB that should be struck from the record, and the Claimant to indicate by 27 June
2014 which of the paragraphs or sentences indicated by the Respondent it objected
being struck from the record. The Tribunal added that it would “take a decision
subsequently, possibly as late as in its Final Award”.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions, on 20 June 2014, the Respondent specified its
request to strike certain paragraphs from the Claimant’s PHB from the record, to which
the Claimant replied in its letter of 27 June 2014.

A further letter from the Respondent was received on 30 June 2014.

As is recalled in the procedural history above,'®> the Tribunal asked further questions

to the Parties on 25 July 2014, which in turn triggered a further round of written
supplementary quantum submissions (and expert reports) as well as one full day of
Hearing, the latter at the request of the Respondent.

At the end of the Quantum Hearing, the President of the Tribunal asked the following
question:

“PRESIDENT LEVY: We had some objections from [the Respondent's] side
with respect to due process. Do those objections still stand, or not now, after
this Hearing? Please, feel free to say that you don't want to answer now. But
if you don't answer now, I would like for you to confirm in writing rather
expeditiously. I don't need the answer now, but I need it, let's say,
expeditiously. So, if you prefer.

MS. HODGSON: Thank you, Mr. President. We will confer, and we will get
back to you as soon as possible.

5 See supra Section II(F).

37

165.

166.

167.

168.

A.

169.

PRESIDENT LEVY: Very well.”!"

The Tribunal received no further comment in this respect from the Respondent after the
Quantum Hearing.

As a general matter, the Tribunal notes that many of the Respondent’s objections
concern answers provided by the Claimant in response to certain specific Tribunal
questions sent to the Parties on 4 March 2014. The Respondent did not object to the
Tribunal’s proposal at the hearing to list questions for the Parties to answer in a single
round of post-hearing submissions to be filed simultaneously.'°’ Furthermore, the
Respondent did not object when the Tribunal forwarded its questions to the Parties on
4 March 2014. It is obvious that the possibility existed that somewhat new arguments
or analysis could be made by either Party in response to such questions: after all, if the
questions could prompt only identical arguments or analysis as those already contained
in previous pleadings, there would have been no need for the Tribunal to ask those
questions in the first place.

More importantly, the Tribunal notes that, after Venezuela first raised its objections on
2 June 2014 (and then specified them in its letters of 10, 20 and 30 June 2014), the
Parties had further opportunities to present their views, both in writing through their
supplemental quantum submissions of 12 September and 31 October 2014 respectively,
and orally at the Quantum Hearing of 22 November 2014. Finally, when asked by the
Tribunal at the end of the Quantum Hearing whether the Respondent would maintain
all or some of the objections recalled above, the Respondent advised that it would get
back to the Tribunal “as soon as possible”. As already noted, the Respondent did not
provide any further comments or complaints, which the Tribunal understands to mean
that the Respondent effectively did not wish to pursue those objections further. The
Tribunal thus trusts that all objections have been satisfactorily resolved or addressed in
the subsequent phase of the arbitration, or have been abandoned for other reasons even
if they might have been warranted at the time they were first made.

Out of abundance of caution and for the sole purpose of the avoidance of doubt, the
Tribunal nonetheless addresses each of Venezuela’s objections in the following
paragraphs.

OBJECTIONS REGARDING CLAIMANT’S PHB

The first two objections raised by Venezuela concern certain points made by the
Claimant in response to Question 1 of the Tribunal’s 4 March 2014 Questions.

Venezuela argues that the Claimant consistently framed its claim positing that notice
was given regarding the rescission in the November 2008 Notice of Dispute, while in

6 Tr, [Supplemental Quantum] 373:19-22 - 374:1-8.
‘07 See Tr. [Jurisdiction and Merits], Day 10, 3010: 5-11 and 3016: 4-6.

38

its answer to the Tribunal’s questions, the Claimant for the first time sought to present
the transfer of Las Cristinas, pursuant to the rescission, as an event independent of the
rescission and constituting a takeover.!°* Venezuela further argues that the Claimant
has not previously framed its jurisdiction rescission claim as one based on the
“rescission’ 77 109

‘and/or

takeover”.

171. Question 1 of the Tribunal’s 4 March 2014 Questions concerned a hypothetical about
the possible consequences that would follow in the event that the Tribunal were to find
that it had no jurisdiction over claims arising directly from the rescission of the MOC.!!°
Because of the decision ultimately taken by the Tribunal that indeed it has jurisdiction
over the entire dispute, the comments made by the Parties in response to Question | are
of no relevance for any matter decided by the Tribunal in this Award, and Venezuela
cannot have been prejudiced by any of such allegedly new arguments. The Tribunal can
thus dispense with expressly resolving this objection.

B. OBJECTION REGARDING CLAIMANT’S PHB

172. | The Respondent’s next objection concerns an argument made by the Claimant that the
relative market multiple method is unaffected by a 20-year contract life.!!!

173. | The Tribunal notes that the Parties had ample opportunity to address the methodological
bases of the market multiples analysis not only in their PHBs, but also subsequently in
their supplemental quantum submissions and at the Quantum Hearing. The
Respondent’s objection that Venezuela has not had an opportunity to respond to those
arguments, whether valid or not when it was made, is thus rejected.

C. OBJECTION REGARDING CLAIMANT’S PHB

174. The Respondent further objects to the Claimant’s introduction of the so-called
Goldcorp implied valuation for 13 April 2008. According to the Respondent, such
implied valuation is new and was not requested by the Tribunal. Venezuela thus had no

Tribunal, 2 June 2014, p. 3.

109 Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal, 20 June 2014, pp. 2-4.

 

1 Question 1 of the Tribunal’s 4 March 2014 reads as follows: “Assuming that the Tribunal would not have
jurisdiction over the claims arising directly from the rescission of the MOC (under either or both jurisdictional
objections put forward by the Respondent), what would be the consequences, if any, on the prayers for relief, on
the awards, on the valuation date, and especially on the amounts to be awarded?”.

'\! Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal, 20 June 2014, pp. 4-6.

39

opportunity to respond to it.'!!? Accordingly, the Respondent requests that those
portions relating to the Goldcorp implied valuation be struck from the record.

175. | The Claimant argues that the so-called “Goldcorp transaction” confirms the results it
has arrived at through its valuation methods.'!

176. The Claimant contends that, in February 2006, Goldcorp acquired 5% of Crystallex’s
shares, as well as the right to purchase an additional 4.9% at US$4.25 per share, for an
overall 9.9% interest.!'* According to the Claimant, because between February 2006
and February 2011 (Claimant’s proposed date of valuation), gold prices more than
doubled, and the value of gold stock indices increased by 62%, the US$982 million
valuation (control premium excluded) at which Goldcorp was willing to purchase
shares in 2006 would have become a valuation of at least US$1.97 billion as of 3
February 2011 (control premium excluded).''> Applying a “market standard” control
premium of 20%, a but-for value of 100% of Crystallex projected from the Goldcorp
investment as of the valuation date would yield a figure of US$2.37 billion.''®
According to the Claimant, these extrapolations from a major real-world investment in
Crystallex’s stock prior to Venezuela’s unlawful measures yield values that should
provide the tribunal with further confirmation that Crystallex’s assessment of the Fair
Market Value of its right at Las Cristinas is reasonable and consistent with market
expectations.!!7

177. | With regard to Venezuela’s objection that the Goldcorp “implied valuation” is new, the
Claimant submits that such valuation is simply an arithmetical relationship between
data that have long been in the record. Furthermore, it is not a valuation per se, but
represents an actual arm’s-length transaction that should serve as a reference point
confirming the reasonableness of the results obtained by its experts.''*

178. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Goldcorp implied valuation is new
and that it was not requested by the Tribunal in any of its questions. The Tribunal has
not resorted to such “valuation” in reaching its conclusions on the damages to be
awarded to the Claimant. The Respondent’s objection in this respect is thus granted.

Tribunal, 2 June 2014, p. 2; Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal, 10 June 2014, p. 2.

OBJECTION REGARDING THE COST APPROACH VALUATION

The Respondent points to the Claimant’s PHB, para. 105, to the Claimant’s PHB Annex
I, paras 11-1 to 11-5 (including tables and footnotes), and 11.6 (1“ sentence), and argues
that the cost approach valuation is based on evidence not in the record and includes
classes of costs never before presented or explained by the Claimant. Venezuela
contends that it was never given an opportunity to respond to such new valuation in
order to demonstrate the various methodological and conceptual flaws it contains.!!?

The Tribunal notes that the Parties subsequently had ample opportunity to address the
cost approach figures put forward by the Claimant in response to the Tribunal’s
questions both in their supplemental quantum submissions and at the Quantum Hearing.
The Respondent’s objection that Venezuela has not had an opportunity to respond to
those arguments is thus rejected. The Tribunal has in any circumstances come to the
conclusion that the cost approach cannot be used as a valuation method in this
arbitration for the reasons set out further below. It has referred to it only for illustrative
purposes, i.e. ex abundanti cautela, to confirm the reasonableness of its conclusions
reached by reference to other valuation methods.

OBJECTION REGARDING CLAIMANT’S PHB

Finally, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s argument made in its PHB at para.
476 that the expropriation began in June 2007 is new, as the Claimant had previously
argued that the alleged “creeping expropriation” began in April 2008.!°

The Claimant rebuts that Venezuela misrepresents its arguments, as it has never
advanced any argument that there was a Treaty breach or creeping expropriation prior
to the Permit Denial Letter of April 2008.'7!

To the extent there could be a possible uncertainty as to the Claimant’s argument with
respect to the time when the alleged “creeping expropriation” began, the Tribunal has
taken note of the Claimant’s clarification in this respect. Given this clarification, the
Tribunal believes that the record has been put straight, and that there cannot be a new
argument made by the Claimant to which the Respondent might have needed to
respond.

IV. THE PARTIES’ PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

184. In this arbitration, the Claimant has made the following prayer for relief (as is stated in
its latest submission, i.e. its Supplemental Quantum Submission):

“[...] Crystallex respectfully requests that the Tribunal:
DECLARE that:

(i) Venezuela has breached Article VII(1) of the Treaty by expropriating the

Section IV summarizes the Parties’ positions as to the disputed facts underlying the
dispute. It presents the positions of the Parties by issues, to the extent possible. Section
V.A deals with Crystallex’s previous mining experience and its investment in Las
Cristinas. Section V.B addresses Crystallex’s permitting process up to the denial of the
Permit in April 2008. Section V.C deals with the issues relating to rescission of the
MOC. Finally, Section V.D presents the Parties’ positions with respect to the alleged
partnerships that Venezuela has concluded with other Parties concerning Las Cristinas,
following the rescission of the MOC.

CRYSTALLEX’S PREVIOUS MINING EXPERIENCE AND ITS INVESTMENT IN Las
CRISTINAS

1. The Claimant’s Position
a. Crystallex was a successful mining company

Crystallex contends that it has been a producer of gold with a successful track record
of exploring, developing and operating mining properties and mines in Latin America,
in particular in Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela.'*4 In Venezuela, Crystallex operated
an open pit mine at Albino 1, in the country’s Kilometer 88 region, adjacent to the Las
Cristinas site.'?° It also conducted mining operations in the El Callao region, by
exploiting the Revenin Mill, the Tomi and the Lo Increible deposits.'° Through these
operations, the Claimant contends to have gained the know-how required to operate
open pit mines in Venezuela, as well as a network of support personnel and suppliers
that could be readily adopted for use in the Las Cristinas project.'?”

Furthermore, Crystallex’s management team was highly experienced.'”* It consisted of
mining experts with extensive experience working with major gold producers such as
Barrick Gold Corporation and major Canadian gold miner, IAMGOLD.'”? Moreover,
Crystallex claims to have hired first class contractors and consultants for the Las
Cristinas project.'*? It instructed one of the world’s leading mining engineering and
construction groups, SNC Lavalin, to prepare the Feasibility Study and the EIS. It also

instructed other leading technical consultants, including MDA. Finally, Crystallex had
a senior management team with significant financial experience, with familiarity with
the financial markets in the US and Canada, which made it possible for Crystallex to
raise significant sums of money.!?!

In any event, even if it was true that Crystallex was a junior mining company and that
its management lacked the competence to maximize the value of Las Cristinas or the
ability to raise the required financing, as Venezuela contends, this would not, in the
Claimant’s view, have impacted the underlying value or development of Las
Cristinas.!*

Crystallex claims that it had the profile of any mining company in an investment phase
seeking to achieve asset growth,!*? and that it is quite common for junior single asset,
or majority single asset gold mining companies, to be loss making when they are in a
development phase.'** However, the value of a company hinges on the nature of the
assets a company has acquired, on the plans it has to develop those assets and on the
value of the cash flows those assets will ultimately produce.!*>

Furthermore, Crystallex was well known to the CVG because it had been working with
the CVG on a number of other projects in the Guyana region, and was thus chosen by
the CVG as its contractual partner for good reason.'*°

b. The Claimant’s investment in Las Cristinas

The Claimant describes Las Cristinas as one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits
in the world, with resources of 20.76 million ounces of gold (plus an additional 6.28
million ounces of inferred resources) containing proven and probable gold reserves of
16.86 million ounces at a gold price of US$550 per ounce.'3” Las Cristinas is, in the
Claimant’s view, characterized by particularly favorable conditions. An international
paved highway, Troncal 10, runs next to Las Cristinas. Furthermore, since 2001, a 400
Kv power line has run parallel to Troncal 10. Thus, any mining project at Las Cristinas
would not require the construction of a major long-distance road to access population

hubs, nor an independent source of power to supply the mine.'** Moreover, the area
also enjoys favorable weather conditions (a temperate climate).'*?

According to the Claimant, under the MOC, Venezuela assumed no risk in the
development of the Las Cristinas project. It was Crystallex who was solely and
exclusively responsible for such development and for compliance with the obligations
arising under the MOC, including the achievement of annual production goals,
regardless of the profitability or economic viability of the project, and notwithstanding
gold price fluctuations. In contrast, Venezuela enjoyed a guaranteed income stream at
all times.'4°

The Claimant submits that, in accordance with its obligations under the MOC to
implement social programs for the benefit of the communities surrounding Las
Cristinas,'4! Crystallex generated a significant number of jobs in the local
community;'#? provided technical support for small-scale mining associations,
especially training in environmentally responsible (i.e., mercury-free) mining
techniques,'** bore the cost of maintenance, supplies and general operations of the Las
Claritas Medical Center, and upgraded the medical center by investing in radiology and
dentistry equipment and providing all necessary medical supplies at the site.'* It also
built a wholly new medical center at Las Claritas, which however the CVG refused to
receive, according to the Claimant.'** In addition, Crystallex built 30 houses;!4°
provided free training to personnel from the local communities in the handling of
machinery and equipment needed for mining operations;'*” installed and integrated
water treatment systems and built an underground sewage system for use by the local
communities;'** paved streets and roads in Las Claritas and Santo Domingo (beyond
its contractual obligations under the MOC);!*? and carried out education initiatives,
including maintaining a program of scholarships and internships for students.'°

According to the Claimant, Crystallex invested heavily in bringing the mine to a
“shovel-ready” stage. Between 2002 and 2010, it invested over US$500 million in the
project, inter alia by acquiring mining and milling equipment that it could assign to the
project at a later date;'>! by rebuilding and upgrading the campsite;!>* by upgrading the
access road from Troncal 10 (the road between Kilometer 85 and Las Cristinas);!** by

paving and extending the airstrip;'** and by building a solid waste landfill.!*>

Crystallex hired MDA to complete a reserve and resource model as well as a mine plan.
Between 2003 and 2007, Crystallex undertook a number of drilling programs to further
delineate the deposit and increase the reserve estimate. A total of 28,427 meters were
drilled in 90 holes.!°° As a result of these studies and drilling programs conducted while
Crystallex was in possession of the site, the proven and probable reserves at Las
Cristinas were increased, according to the Claimant, by 77% from the original estimated
amount of 9.5 million ounces (according to the 2002 data received by the CVG) to
16.86 million ounces of proven and probable reserves as verified in 2007.!*7

c.  Crystallex’s Feasibility Study

As recounted above,'** Crystallex submitted its first version of the Feasibility Study,
prepared by SNC-Lavalin, in September 2003. After nearly two and a half years of
discussions and negotiations, the Ministry of Mines approved Crystallex’s Feasibility
study on 6 March 2006.'*?

According to the Claimant, its Feasibility Study reflected a modular plan that involved
constructing a 20,000 tpd processing plant, followed by a second 20,000 tpd processing
plant that would take mining up to 40,000 tpd as soon as practicable.'® Crystallex
claims that there were financial, technical and common sense reasons in favor of
Crystallex’s modular approach.'®!

Crystallex submits that the Feasibility Study was fully compliant with the MOC (as the
CVG’s approval shows)'™ and it was fully compliant with Venezuelan law because the
Ministry of Mines approved it in March 2006.'®

d. — Crystallex raised equity and debt to finance the project

With the aim of raising funding for the project, Crystallex worked with Deutsche Bank
and BNP Paribas who designed a financing strategy that would work in stages,
mirroring Crystallex’s plan to start operations quickly by initially processing 20,000
tpd, but then increase to 40,000 tpd.!

According to the Claimant, the record shows that, at every stage, Crystallex always
succeeded in raising funds to go to the next stage in development.'® Even when gold
prices were relatively low, Crystallex successfully raised over US$500 million.

The Claimant explains that its decision to favor equity financing over project finance
(at that stage of the project) was based on reasons of convenience and prudent
planning.'®’ In this respect, Crystallex never had any issues raising the financing
required to fund the development of Las Cristinas, even during the period after the
Permit denial and before the MOC was rescinded.!°

Furthermore, some of the major institutional investors worldwide invested in
Crystallex.' During the years in which the permitting process was underway,
Crystallex concluded non-disclosure agreements with a significant number of potential
investors so as to better enable them to conduct due diligence.!”

2. The Respondent’s Position
a. General remarks on Las Cristinas

Venezuela first stresses that the geography and topography of the Las Cristinas area
presents certain particular challenges to its development, including (i) its location in a
remote tropical rainforest, affected by heavy rainfall and seasonal flooding; (ii) the

poverty of the soils in the area and the fragility of the ecosystems that rely upon them;
(iii) the fact that the site borders the Las Brisas mining concessions and the Cuyuni
River (which requires the operator to have a water plan to prevent water build-up in the
mines); (iv) the low grade nature of the gold deposit; and (v) the presence of a large
number of small-scale illegal miners.'7! Furthermore, Las Cristinas lies in the Imataca
Reserve, which is a fragile rainforest with an extremely varied biodiversity and a
significant indigenous population.'””

As a preliminary matter, Venezuela highlights that Crystallex did not hold a
“concession” of exploration and exploitation.'”? Consequently, it never held a mining
title, which carries with it certain rights over the property.!” Rather, consistent with the
Venezuelan Constitution!” and Article 23 of the Mining Law,'”° the right to explore
and exploit the mineral reserve at Las Cristinas was reserved to, and at all times
remained with, the State.'’7 The MOC was thus effectively a service contract, executed
on the understanding that the right to explore and exploit the mineral reserve at Las
Cristinas ultimately remained with the State, acting through the Ministry of Mines,
which, in turn, assigned operations to the CVG.'78 However, while Crystallex stood as
a mere operator vis-a-vis the CVG, the MOC incorporated certain obligations typical
of a concessionaire, e.g. to submit a Feasibility Study within a period of one year from
the date of signature of the MOC and to provide so-called “special advantages” (i.e.,
obligations to promote societal and economic benefits in the area).!7

b. — Crystallex was a junior mining company with limited experience and
uncertain financing

Venezuela contends that Crystallex was a junior mining company that became involved
in a project for which it lacked technical, financial and environmental planning
capacity.!8°

For the Respondent, a review of Crystallex’s own annual reports reveals that Crystallex
self-identified as a junior mining company and operated only a few significantly smaller
mines, and moreover, did so at a loss.'®! Furthermore, Crystallex played no role in the
initial permitting or the closing of the few small mines it operated, and it possessed no
experience operating large-scale mines (such as Las Cristinas).'**

c.  Crystallex’s “Feasibility Plan” and other studies were deficient

The Respondent contends that the Feasibility Study presented by Crystallex in
September 2003 was initially not approved by the Ministry of Mines, and that it took
Crystallex several years to sufficiently address the concerns of the Ministry of Mines
with respect to the development and production goals.'*? When Crystallex’s Feasibility
Study was finally approved by the Ministry of Mines in March 2006, it was clear, the
Respondent contends, that several technical, environmental and economic parameters
still required significant additional work. In particular, according to Venezuela, the
Feasibility Study was based on limited drilling, metallurgical testing and environmental
work, with much of the analysis based on Placer Dome studies, which resulted in
potential inaccuracies. '**

For the Respondent, Crystallex never had a concrete plan for developing Las Cristinas
that approached a feasibility study level. Rather, it consistently modified central aspects
of its project — from the processing plan and mine life (which varied from 20,000 to
40,000 tpd at various different operational life spans), to its reserve estimates, to the
cost of capital and operating costs.'*°

The Respondent notes that the initial “Feasibility Study” produced in September 2003
by Crystallex envisioned that it would take 34 years to extract and process the Las
Cristinas deposit at a 20,000 tpd processing rate.'*° The reaction of the CVG was that

the 34-year mine life exceeded the 20-year initial term of the MOC.'®’ Further, in a 4
December 2003 letter, the CVG reiterated its preference for a 20-year mine life and a
40,000 tpd production capacity.'**

211. The “Additional Clarifications” produced by Crystallex on 19 December 2003
envisioned a production capacity of 20,000 tpd for the first seven years, followed by a
production capacity of 40,000 tpd for the subsequent 13 years.'*? However, the
Respondent points out that only one month later, SNC-Lavalin produced a drastically
different “Feasibility Study” that proposed processing 40,000 tpd from year | through
year 20.'°° For the Respondent this study was not presented as an alternative to the
CVG (as the Claimant contends), but it was the project feasibility study.'?!

212. In February 2004, Addendum 1 was produced to the CVG,!”? in which Crystallex
explained that for financing reasons it could not state a production capacity of 40,000
before year 9.!°3 The CVG approved and sent the 2003 SNC-Lavalin “Feasibility
Study” together with the Addendum to the Ministry of Mines for approval.!**

213. | The Respondent contends that all of these studies suffered from a fundamental flaw
based on their reliance on largely unverified drilling data from the Placer Dome data
set,!95

214. Furthermore, the Respondent points out that in August 2005, Crystallex produced yet
another plan for its project, the so-called SNC-Lavalin Development Plan,!°° which
would have a processing capacity of only 20,000 tpd and a mine life of 41 years, without
any reference to eventually expanding to a 40,000 tpd processing capacity at a later

'87 See SNC-Lavalin minutes of the meeting between Crystallex and the CVG held on 29 October 2003, 3
November 2003, Exh. C-111, point 3.2 (“The CVG reminded Crystallex that the mining contract is for an initial
20 years which may be extended. The Ministry of Mines sees any extension beyond 20 years as a change of contract
and could use it as a point of argument. The CVG wants to avoid any problems with the Ministry and would prefer
to see the mining complete within the 20 year initial term of the contract.”).

stage.'97 And two months later, in the so-called SNC-Lavalin “Expansion Plan”,!%8

Crystallex proposed that it would mine 20,000 tpd in the first two years and then expand
to 40,000 tpd in year 3 until year 23.

Finally, in November 2007, MDA produced a technical report!? that once more,
according to the Respondent, changed the overall project plan, by proposing that the
deposit would be mined at 20,000 tpd, resulting in a mine life of 64 years.?”

Thus, the Respondent contends that Crystallex’s constant vacillation regarding two of
the most important aspects of the overall project (i.e., processing capacity and mine
life) yields the inescapable conclusion that it was unable to develop a concrete viable
plan that would be palatable to both investors and the Venezuelan regulatory
agencies.”"' Crystallex never presented a true feasibility study with a single
comprehensive plan for the development and operation at Las Cristinas. The studies
presented, to the contrary, offered varying and distinct plans that went to the very core
of the operations.”

Thus, the Respondent concludes that “[w]hile the Ministry of Mines, in a good faith
effort to move the project along, agreed to accept Crystallex’s September 2003
“Feasibility Study” as supplemented by the February 2004 “Addendum”, this did not
mean that Crystallex met its commitment to submit a fully realized plan for the Las

Cristinas project (as demonstrated by the various subsequent efforts)”.?°

d. — Crystallex’s ability to raise financing is overstated

‘Venezuela contends that it is difficult to square Crystallex’s current position that project
financing, and the institutional lenders who might have provided it, were irrelevant and,
therefore, are of no consequence to determining whether it had a viable project, with its
repeated statements to the contrary in the years when it was pursuing the permitting

process.?4

In this respect, the Respondent points to statements made by Crystallex before, during
and after the permit review process to the effect that it would seek project financing.?°>

For Venezuela, project financing and bank lending would have been necessary
components of any financing for a major project like Las Cristinas. However, the
Respondent suggests that Crystallex never obtained traditional project financing from
institutional lenders — including from its advisors BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank —
most likely because Crystallex’s history of operational losses and constantly evolving
plans for Las Cristinas did no meet the strict due diligence criteria that those lenders
employ.”

Pointing to Crystallex’s own annual reports and financial information, the Respondent
contends that Crystallex struggled at every step to obtain sufficient financing to
develop, construct and operate Las Cristinas.?°’ Thus, even if Crystallex had received
the Permit in April 2008, the tightness of the credit markets following the worldwide
financial crisis in late 2008 virtually eliminated whatever chances Crystallex had to
raise funding for the project.2°*

THE DENIAL OF THE PERMIT

1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that the Permit it was seeking from the Ministry of Environment
in order to exploit Las Cristinas was denied in an arbitrary manner, unrelated to the EIS
approval process. It claims that the technical review of the EIS was successfully
concluded on 16 May 2007, when the Ministry of Environment notified Crystallex that
it had “analyzed and approved” the EIS; that the 16 May 2007 letter did not relate only
to preliminary works, but to the entire Las Cristinas project; that the Permit that was
promised in such letter was for exploitation, and not for exploration. With regard to the
denial of the Permit in April 2008, the Claimant submits that one key document on
which the denial is based is fraudulent, and that the Permit denial itself is defective in
its own terms. It also contends that, after the Permit denial, Venezuela subjected
Crystallex to a “rollercoaster” of mistreatment because on the one hand it made the
company believe that it could still obtain the Permit, and on the other hand it threatened
to nationalize or “take back” Las Cristinas.

a. The technical review of the EIS was completed in 2007

particular the Ministry of Environment, concerning the environmental aspects of the
project.

i. 2003/2004: The EIS is submitted to the CVG and the Ministry of
Environment

224. The 950-page EIS was prepared by Crystallex with SNC Lavalin and submitted to the
CVG for review in December 2003.2” A revised draft of the EIS, following comments
by the CVG to Crystallex, was submitted on 27 February 2004.7! On 15 April 2004,
on the same day the CVG submitted the Feasibility Study to the Ministry of Mines, the
CVG submitted the EIS to the Ministry of Environment’s offices in Bolivar State and
Caracas for approval.?!! The Claimant stresses that the EIS submitted on 15 April 2004
was for the whole project, i.e. it addressed the impact of the entire Las Cristinas project,
from construction through operation to mine closure.?!”

ii. 2004: Crystallex submits Addenda to the EIS and further studies

225. In May 2004, Crystallex submitted a “Technical Forestry Report” and a “Forestry

Repopulation Plan”.2!*

226. On31 May 2004, the Ministry of Environment (Bolivar) sent the CVG written technical
observation on the EIS.2'* These addressed, inter alia, the following items: water
management issues; whether additional baseline data would be collected; the size of the
tailings management facility; the risk of acid rock drainage in the tailings pond; why
the chapter of the EIS setting out the environmental supervision plan was in outline
form; the extent of the forestry inventory; resettlement plans for illegal miners; why it

satisfaction”,”!° by submitting on 15 June 2004 a response along with a report prepared
by SNC Lavalin for that purpose.!”

228. On 1 July 2004, the Ministry replied stating that “all technical and legal factors
requested by this Office were duly clarified”.?!* However, it added that a number of
outstanding issues still remained to be resolved before the Permit could be issued.
Those included the fact that the Feasibility Study had first to be approved by the
Ministry of Mines; whether the diversion channel would flow through the Potaso pit or
around it; and whether the water diversion channel would be designed to withstand a
200-year flood of all four streams whose water it was designed to carry.?!? The Ministry

July 2004 and 31 July 2006.2? In this letter, the Ministry made observations, inter alia,
on the fact that the EIS had been presented without prior terms of reference, and on the
fact that the social, cultural and environmental impact of the project had been
underestimated. Furthermore, it noted that the social impact associated with the illegal
miners whom Crystallex would not employ had not been clearly defined. The Ministry
concluded by demanding that the project be reformulated, starting with the preparation
of new Terms of Reference.

235. According to the Claimant, the imprecise and vague observations contained in the
three-page letter of 29 December 2004 made it difficult for Crystallex to understand
how exactly it should have reformulated its plan.?*4

iv. 2005-2006: Further exchanges and the Porlamar meeting

236. According to the Claimant, following the appointment of Jacqueline Faria as new
Minister of Environment in early 2005 (with related change in Ministry personnel), the
Ministry changed course over its prior request that Crystallex start the project from
scratch.?9

237. During 2005, a number of workshops were held with the new Ministry personnel.?°°

For the Claimant, there is no merit to Venezuela’s assertion that the Ministry spent the
whole of 2005 making “continued requests” for information.2*’ In contradistinction,
Crystallex argues that, in the first six months of 2005, the Ministry of Environment
made only a single request for further information, when it requested an updated
baseline study in relation to vegetation, fauna and the quality of the environment.?**
The only other feedback Crystallex received was on the environmental social plan.?*?

In June 2005, the Minister of Mines publicly stated that the status of the Permit was
“well on track” and that the issuance of the Permit was “following its normal, routine

course. It’s a bureaucratic formality”.?*°

In July 2005, Crystallex completed the “Social Investment Plan”, which was the result
of consultations with indigenous and criol/o communities located in the project’s zone
of influence.*! This plan designed a number of social programs, ranging from
promoting environmental conservation to supporting alternative to mining and
enhancing community relations.”4? The Social Investment Plan was presented at a
workshop with the Ministry on 19 July 2005.74

Crystallex claims that in March 2006, it had to resubmit to the Ministry thirteen boxes
of documents containing the EIS and related documents, because the Ministry had
allegedly lost the files.?

On 31 July 2006, the Ministry of Environment wrote to the CVG concerning the Las
Cristinas Permit application.’*> According to the Claimant, the letter did not contain
any analysis of Crystallex’s EIS or the many other documents it had submitted for
review during this period. Instead, the Ministry declared that, given the size and
importance of the project, it intended to undertake a “Strategic Environmental
Evaluation”.*° Such Strategic Environmental Evaluation for the Claimant is not a
recognized or required procedure under Venezuelan law, but simply a “bureaucratic
contrivance” that had been employed by the Ministry only once before in a project
involving PDVSA.2*”

On 17-18 October 2006, meetings organized by the Canadian embassy in Venezuela
were held at Porlamar, which were attended by the Ministry of Environment
(represented by Mr. Rodriguez, a witness in this arbitration), by Crystallex and by Gold
Reserve, the operator of the adjacent Las Brisas concession (the “Porlamar
meeting”).* According to the meeting minutes,

“There is an order from the Minister of the Environment, Eng. Jacqueline

In that regard, Rodriguez informed that Minister Faria had instructed that the
procedure to grant permits be completed as soon as possible, and so did Vice
Minister Nora Delgado, who also ordered that the procedure to grant permits
be hastened until they were granted”.”"”

243. Further, according to the meeting minutes, the Ministry inquired about the cumulative
impact caused by both projects (Las Cristinas and Las Brisas) and wished to see Gold
Reserve and Crystallex agree on surface water drainage management, in particular, the
movement of the diversion channel.”*°

244. At the meeting, Crystallex and Gold Reserve were able to agree, amongst other things,
that the diversion channel would be moved (at Crystallex’s expenses) to the north, in
order to accommodate the desire of Gold Reserve to maintain access to ore extending
beyond the boundaries of its concession.”*!

245. On 21 November 2006, Ms. Laura Paredes, also a witness in this arbitration and then
Director General for Mining Concessions at the Ministry of Mines, wrote an internal
memorandum to Minister of Mines José Khan summarizing the key information about
the Las Cristinas project, and recommending that Minister Khan forward this
memorandum to the Minister of Environment with a view to accelerating the Permit
process.”°? The memorandum reads in relevant parts:

“Currently, Crystallex in full co-ordination with the CVG, has already
complied with all its pre-construction obligations, including all the works of
social interest that were required. Likewise, it has already carried out all the
important and difficult activities to ensure the financing of the main project.
Complying with its undertaking to build in record time, it has already
purchased machinery and parts for more than 75 million dollars and has
concluded contracts with the necessary third parties for the additional sum of
90 million dollars. Nonetheless, the construction of the Las Cristinas Project
has not been able to begin, given that it is still waiting for the Minister of the
Environment to issue the permit for affecting natural resources. This permit
was requested by the CVG in conjunction with Crystallex. While waiting for
the permit, Crystallex is bearing the enormous cost of maintaining the
equipment in storage at international ports and continuing the payments for
the contracts and financing services, which cannot continue indefinitely
given the enormous financial burden this imposes.

FOR ALL THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, HAVING VERIFIED THE
LEGALITY OF THE CONTRACT, IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THE
CITIZEN PRESIDENT SEND THE PRESENT MEMORANDUM OF
INFORMATION TO THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF THE
ENVIRONMENT, CITIZEN JAQUELINE FARIA IN ORDER TO
OBTAIN THE ISSUE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT”.?**

v. The 22D ber 2006 ing and sub h

It is further the Claimant’s argument that on 22 December 2006, a meeting was held
between the CVG, Gold Reserve and the Ministry of Environment, to discuss the
permitting process and certain documents that the Ministry had requested by way of
letter on 19 December 2006.74 According to the Claimant, the minutes of the 22
December 2006 meeting show that the CVG was told that the Environmental Permit to
build the mine at Las Cristinas would be issued within three months if certain
documents were delivered.*> The Claimant disputes Venezuela’s reading of this
meeting, whereby the Ministry informed the CVG that, if certain documents were
produced they would receive a preliminary permit only for certain limited infrastructure
works that Crystallex had requested two and a half years before when it first applied
for the permit. The Claimant points at the minutes that list a number of items in
relation to which the Ministry committed to issue a permit (if certain documents were
provided). These items included the “construction of the processing plant” and
“opening of pits”. Thus, the minutes show that the Permit to be issued would cover
issues that are at the very heart of the construction of the mine and formed no longer
part of the long abandoned preliminary request made in 2004.57

For the Claimant, the Ministry could not grant a preliminary permit to engage in the
cost of construction of a processing plant and a deviation channel without the certainty
that such plant would be permitted to operate.?>*

The Claimant disputes the relevance of the distinction between a “short term” and a
“medium term” permitting process, which is emphasized by Venezuela by reference to
these minutes. According to Venezuela, the Permit to be issued on a “short term” basis
(within 3 months, according to the minutes) could only relate to preliminary works.??
The Claimant rebuts that the projects listed in the minutes as being “medium terms”

priorities for which a Permit could be expecting in “approximately three years” related
to the two projects that Gold Reserve and Crystallex had agreed to build jointly at the
Porlamar meeting (i.e., the community landing strip and sanitary landfill for San Isidro
Parish).? Only those two projects were to be subject to “medium term” approval, and
importantly neither of those joint projects was required to construct or to operate any
of the mines.

Crystallex further claims that it answered each of the Ministry’s queries to the 19
December 2006 letter in an 8-volume submission dated 16 February 2007.7°!

On 27 March 2007, Laura Paredes, the Director General of Mining Concessions at the
Ministry of Mines, who had also been sent a copy of the latest Crystallex submission?
and who had been liaising with the Ministry of Environment, wrote to Crystallex,
stating that:

“Knowing that the company Crystallex has complied duly and opportunely
with all of the requirements imposed by the Ministry of Environment during
the meeting of 22 December 2006, this Directorate has learned directly from
the Directorate General of Permissions at the Ministry of the Environment
that they are waiting [to receive] from the CVG the following requirement.

Plan for the use of copper so as to minimize environmental damage”.”°
This additional information was sent by the CVG to the Ministry of Environment on 17
April 2007.2

vi. The 16 May 2007 letter from the Ministry of Environment

On 16 May 2007, the Ministry of Environment, through its then Vice-Minister of
Environmental Administration and Governance, Merly Garcia, sent a letter to
Crystallex, inviting it to post a Bond and to pay certain environmental taxes, after which
the Permit would be handed over.”®> According to the Claimant, through this letter the
Ministry of Environment approved the EIS, including the proposed measures and
programs contained in such study for the preservation of the environment, which the
Ministry expressly indicated had been “analyzed and approved”.?®° Thus, Crystallex

contends, at this point in time it had complied with all of the substantive requirements
to obtain the environmental Permit.”

253. | The 16 May 2007 letter, which for Crystallex expressed the Ministry’s approval of the
EIS and the promise to issue an environmental Permit subject only to the fulfillment of
a procedural formality is, for the Claimant, of fundamental importance, because it
shows that the Ministry was fully satisfied with the last round of documents it had
received from Crystallex in early 2007.7° The 16 May 2007 letter was the culmination
of the technical process that had begun when Crystallex submitted its EIS to the
Ministry of Environment in April 2004.7

vii. The posting of the Bond, the payment of the taxes and the draft
Permit

254. On 18 May 2007, Crystallex complied with the remaining formalities mentioned in the
16 May 2007 letter, i.e. the posting of the Bond and the payment of the environmental

taxes.?”

255. Around this time, Crystallex claims to have received a draft of the Permit from the
Ministry of Environment.2”! According to the Claimant, the Ministry asked Crystallex
to help it finalize the Permit by verifying the accuracy of some technical details, such
as the exact coordinates of the mine site.”””

b. The letter of 16 May 2007 did not relate only to preliminary works

256. | According to the Claimant, the Permit promised in the Ministry letter of 16 May 2007
did not relate only to preliminary works, as the Respondent contends. Crystallex
submits that Article 14 of Decree 1757, the key source of regulations governing EISs
in Venezuela, provides for a single environmental permit covering all of the stages of
a project, which rules out the possibility of obtaining a partial permit that would not
allow Crystallex to build the mine and extract gold from Las Cristinas.*”? The
Administration cannot authorize the construction of an entire mining complex,

including a processing plant and 8-km-long diversion channel, if it does not also
approve all of the measures described in the EIS for the construction, operation and
closure of the project.?”* In other words, Venezuelan law requires an EIS — with all its
impacts and related mitigation measures — to be approved as a whole.?’> An approval
of only part of an EIS and the issue of a partial environmental Permit would mean that
construction of a project could begin before the fundamental question of whether the
environmental impact of the project was tolerable had been resolved, which in
Crystallex’s view is impermissible under Venezuelan law.?’°

Crystallex explains that, initially, Crystallex and the CVG believed that quicker
progress could be made if an early authorization could be obtained for certain
preliminary work that would prepare the site for major construction works.””” Thus, the
CVG explained to the Ministry of Environment, when submitting the EIS on 15 April
2004, that it was also seeking preliminary authorization for a number of items, such as
the extension of access roads into the site, the construction of a diversion channel, the
construction of a sanitary landfill.2”* However, according to the Claimant, this request
for preliminary permit was abandoned by the CVG/Crystallex in late 2004 as the
Ministry of Environment took the view that the EIS for the Las Cristinas project had to
be approved before it would permit works to be undertaken that would impact the
environment.”” For the Claimant, between April 2004 and May 2007, the Ministry of
Environment raised questions regarding several aspects of the project, from the
construction of the mine, to its operation, closure and reclamation, to which Crystallex
responded.?*° Furthermore, as discussed above,”*! the minutes of the 22 December 2006
meeting clearly show, according to the Claimant, that the Ministry was prepared to
issue an Environmental Permit for the infrastructure works necessary to build the entire
mine.?*

Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the measures listed at the end of the 16 May
2007 letter, whose implementation the Bond was supposed to secure (and which
according to the Claimant contained elements of construction, operation and closure of

the mine), greatly exceeded the scope of those preliminary works and clearly related to
the entire project described in the EIS.?**

259. It would make no sense for the Ministry to request a bond if the scope of the measures
that it is supposed to guarantee — which form the basis for the calculation of its amount
— had not been already approved.?*+

c. The promised Permit was for exploitation, not for exploration

260.  Crystallex contends that the Permit that was promised in the 16 May 2007 letter was
for exploitation, and not for exploration. The fact that the letter refers, in two passages,
to “exploration” (and not to “exploitation’’) is, in the Claimant’s view, merely the result
of a typographical error, as can be deduced from the context of the approval and the
numerous other documents following on from the 16 May 2007 letter which replace the

erroneous word “exploration” with the intended term “exploitation”.?°>

261. First, the EIS referred to in the 16 May 2007 letter, which was said to have been
“analyzed and approved”, made no reference whatsoever to any exploration activity,
and dealt with the construction, exploitation and closure of the mine.?°°

262. Second, other documents on the record show that what was at issue in the 16 May 2007
letter was exploitation.?*” The Claimant points in particular to the letter from the
Ministry of Environment to the CVG dated 23 August 2007, which states that the Permit
promised in the 16 May 2007 letter was for (a) the construction of infrastructure and
services; and (b) the exploitation phase of the Las Cristinas project.?°*

263. Furthermore, as a matter of Venezuelan law, a permit that relates to the construction of

289 Reply, para. 352; C-PHB, para. 114. According to Decree 1257, “exploitation” and “exploration” are definined
as follows: “Mining exploitation: Process to extract and process minerals as well as the activity intended to prepare
and develop the areas that include the mineral mass or deposit”; “Mining exploration: Activity intended to
determine the presence, quality, and geological characteristics of the mineral deposit and to quantify and assess the

conjunction with the Feasibility Study, and in fact they were delivered to the Ministry
of Environment and the Ministry of Mines, respectively, on the same day (on 15 April
2004).?*° Because Decree 1757 establishes that an EIS for the exploitation phase should
accompany a Feasibility Study, it follows, for the Claimant, that the measures described
in the EIS and any permit issued on the basis of such measures were going to relate to
the exploitation phase of the project.2?!

Finally, the exploration phase of the project had already been concluded by Crystallex
(and, before, by Placer Dome).”°?

Also, the bond requested clearly related to exploitation. This is evident if one compares
its amount (B$5.2 billion) to the amount of B$20.7 million which had been requested
in 2006 in connection for an application of an exploration permit (to conduct
exploratory drilling of 40 holes).?

d. ‘The permitting process was technical, not discretionary

For the Claimant, there was nothing discretionary about the duty of the Ministry of
Environment to issue the Permit promised in the 16 May 2007 letter, once Crystallex
had duly paid the stamp tax and the Bond requested by the Ministry. Crystallex
contends that Article 27 of the Stamp Tax Law provides that the tax whose payment
was required by the Vice-Minister of Environment is payable simultaneously with the
issuance of the Permit.2%* Furthermore, Article 45 of Decree 1257 provides that the
purpose of bonds like the one requested by the Vice-Minister of the Environment is to
guarantee the measures contemplated in the EIS. It would only be reasonable, in the
Claimant’s view, to expect that a bond would be required at the end of the permitting
process, once the measures and the EIS itself had already been approved by the Ministry
of Environment.?°

For the Claimant, the power to issue an environmental permit requires determining
whether a certain harm to the environment is a “tolerable harm”, which can be made
only after a rigorous technical, environmental and socio-economic analysis has been

reserves that can be used”. See Decree 1257, 13 March 1996, published in the Gaceta Oficial No. 35,946 on 25
April 1996, Exh. C-2, Art. 3.6 and Art. 3.7, respectively.

conducted.?*” When so-called “indeterminate legal concepts” of a technical nature, such
as “tolerable harm” (which is not specifically defined under Venezuelan law), are
involved, the relevant decision by the Administration depends strictly on the result of
the technical analysis conducted in the case in question.?** In those cases, the decision-
maker is not given any form of discretion or the power to factor in considerations of
opportunity or convenience.?””

For the Claimant, once the EIS approval was granted based on technical elements, there
was no further discretion in relation to the issuance of the Permit. For that reason and
in any circumstances, the 16 May 2007 letter uses imperative language: “Once the Bond
has been posted, checked and found to be compliant by this Office, the [Permit] will be
handed over” (les sera entregado, in the Spanish original).*°°

e. After the 16 May 2007 letter, Crystallex expected prompt issuance of the

Permit

According to the Claimant, its expectation that it would promptly receive the Permit
after 16 May was based not only on the terms of the 16 May 2007 letter, but also on
past experience. In 2006, Crystallex had sought and received an environmental Permit
to conduct further drilling at Las Cristinas. In that instance, the Permit was handed over
to Crystallex on the very same day that the bond was posted.*”! Crystallex was also
aware that in March 2007 it had taken Gold Reserve only one week from the posting of
the bond and the payment of the taxes to be issued the relevant environmental permit
for the adjacent Las Brisas site.*°”

Furthermore, the expectations that the Las Cristinas Permit would be quickly delivered
were strengthened, according to the Claimant, on 22 May 2007, when just four days
after Crystallex had posted its Bond and paid its taxes, it received a draft copy of its
environmental Permit. Crystallex argues that this draft Permit clearly shows that the
work of preparing the Permit had already been completed.*”

271. On 4 October 2007, the National Assembly Committee on Economic Development
called a hearing to discuss the permitting process at Las Cristinas.*”* In addition to
Crystallex’s representatives, Mr. Sergio Rodriguez, representing the Ministry of
Environment, and Ms. Laura Paredes, representing the Ministry of Mines, testified at
that hearing.*”° According to the minutes,

“Laura Paredes, MIBAM’s representative, placed no obstacles to the
granting of the permits, since the Ministry represented by her already issued
the corresponding license for the beginning of the development of the
project. She emphasized the importance of the participation of the

Community Councils, particularly in relation to special advantages”.*°°

272. Furthermore, according to the minutes,

“Eng. Sergio Rodriguez, Planning Director of the MARN, referred, in
general, to environmental aspects. He also agreed with the matters related to
the participation of Community Councils in the projects to be developed”.*°"

273. The Claimant underscores that, at the hearing, the Chairman of the Committee, Deputy
Gutierrez, confirmed that based on “conversations held with the highest authorities of
the Ministry of the Environment, [...] there is no legal impediment for the [Ministry of
the Environment] to grant the permits”.*°* The official report set out the following
conclusions:

“Tn accordance with the statements of the participants in this meeting, the
following conclusions are drawn:

1. — The concessionaire, Corporacién Venezolana de Guayana (C.V.G), and
the operator, Crystallex International, have complied with both the feasibility
study and the other legal and technical requirements established for the
corresponding permits to be granted to them by the Ministry of the
Environment for the commencement of the construction and development of
Las Cristinas Project.

2. — The delay in the granting of the permits affects the operator, due to the
significant burden of personnel and maintenance expenses and
socioeconomic expenditure that it has. It also delays a great part of the
benefits for the community established in the agreement in relation to
employment, housing, and education matters.

3. — The Chairman of the Committee reiterates demands to the Ministry of

The Claimant submits that, because the minutes confirm that the National Assembly’s
conclusions were drawn “in accordance with the statements of the participants in this
meeting”,>!° Crystallex understood that both the Ministry of Mines and the Ministry of
Environment, through their representatives, were in agreement that Crystallex had
complied with every legal and technical requirement to receive the environmental
Permit.*!!

f. The Permit was denied in an arbitrary manner unrelated to the EIS

For the Claimant, there was no technical or legal basis for the permit denial. For the
Claimant, the Permit denial letter is defective in its own terms, and furthermore is based
on only one internal “technical report”, which in the Claimant’s view is likely to have
been fabricated ex post facto to justify the Permit denial.

The Claimant contends that the Permit denial came “as a shock” to Crystallex given
that approval of the EIS had already taken place and the Ministry of Environment had
confirmed that the Permit would be handed over after the posting of the Bond and the
payment of the required environmental taxes.*!”

According to the Claimant, the justifications adduced by the Ministry of Environment
(i.e., concerns for the environmental and indigenous people of the Imataca Forest
Reserve) had never been raised during the four-year approval process and were not
supported by a single study or document to demonstrate that the project would
adversely impact the Imataca region, where mining activities had already been
expressly authorized?!

For Crystallex, the Permit denial letter of 14 April 2008 fails to refer to a single page
or paragraph of the 948-page EIS submitted in April 2004, to any of the thousands of
pages of addenda and supplementary reports to that study, or to any of the 460 pages
submitted in February 2007 in response to the Ministry’s final request for information
of 22 December 2006.*'* The Permit denial vaguely alludes to unidentified “technical

inspection reports” about illegal mining and “research carried out by the specialists
competent in the matter”, without any more specific support.*!°

The Claimant has further developed the following arguments as to why the Permit
denial lacked support and was arbitrary.

i. The Permit denial is based on one fraudulent document: Exhibit R-
52

For the Claimant, the technical inspection report, allegedly prepared in September
2006, filed by Venezuela as Exhibit R-52, is the only technical report on the record that
categorically recommends the denial of the environmental Permit.*!° The Permit denial
letter of 14 April 2008 closely resembles Exhibit R-52.*'7 One will see below that the
Respondent avers that Exhibit R-52, also referred to as the “Technical Inspection
Report” or the “Romero Report”, foreshadows the letter which denied the Permit in
April 2008. For Crystallex, the consistency and authenticity of Exhibit R-52 is of great
importance because Venezuela, through the process of document disclosure in this
arbitration, has confirmed that there were no other technical inspection reports,
environmental studies, research data or reports of any kind referred to in the Permit
denial letter or relied on in the preparation of that letter.*'* Thus, the Permit denial was
based on just one document: Exhibit R-52.3!

For the Claimant, during the Hearing it became apparent that the report is not a genuine
contemporary record of any actual site inspection, but a fraudulent document apparently
created well after September 2006 for the purpose of justifying the Permit denial.*”°

First, according to the Claimant, the alleged date on which the report was prepared
(September 2006) raises a number of inconsistencies with other contemporaneous
documents, which appear to suggest different courses of actions (e.g., requests for
additional documents from Crystallex).*?! For example, in October 2006, Mr. Sergio
Rodriguez, one of Venezuela’s witnesses, told the representatives of Crystallex and
Gold Reserve at the Porlamar meeting that the process of issuing the permits was to be

accelerated.” Further, on 22 December 2006, Crystallex was given a list of additional
documents it was required to provide for the Permit to be issued.*?*

More importantly, for the Claimant the document is “nothing but a crude forgery”.?74

Crystallex explains that the report is printed on a letterhead bearing the name of the
“Ministerio del Poder Popular para el Ambiente”. However, the Claimant explains, in
September 2006 the Ministry of Environment was called the “Ministerio del Ambiente”.
It did not change its name to “Ministerio del Poder Popular para el Ambiente” until 8
January 2007, when the Venezuelan Official Gazette published Presidential Decree
5103 issued by President Chavez on 28 December 2006, through which the prefix “de/
Poder Popular” was added to the names of all Venezuelan Ministries.*?°

At the hearing, Ms. Charly Rodriguez, a technician in the Bureau of Environmental
Quality, explained this apparent inconsistency by suggesting that the report could have
been prepared on a computer immediately after a site inspection in September 2006,
but that it had probably been printed out at a later date using the Ministry’s updated
letterhead.*”° However, the Claimant underscores that even the text of Exhibit R-52
(and not just the letterhead) refers to the “Ministerio del Poder Popular’ in one passage.
Ms. Rodriguez suggested that the Ministry might have started using the new name after
an announcement by President Chavez on his television program “Al6 Presidente”.*”
However, this, for Crystallex, is impossible, as the first announcement about the new
ministerial name was made at the end of December 2006, i.e. three months after Exhibit
R-52 was supposedly written.*?*

Clear proof of this, according to the Claimant, derives from the fact that none of the
Ministry’s letters and internal documents on record in this arbitration dating form the
period September 2006 to end-December 2006 contain body text or a letterhead that

refers to the “Ministerio del Poder Popular” 3”

For the Claimant, the conclusion is thus unavoidable: Exhibit R-52 was written long
after September 2006, and it was tailor-made after the fact to justify the conclusion in

the Permit denial letter of 14 April 2008. Exhibit R-52 is thus “a crude fraud incapable

of being a valid source of justification for the conclusion in the Permit Denial Letter”.**°

Even if Exhibit R-52 were a genuine document, in the Claimant’s view it could not
justify the denial of the Permit under Venezuelan law or the Treaty because its alleged
justifications are unreasonable, illogical, inconsistent and technically unsound.**!
Crystallex submits that the report does not contain a single specific reference to any
page of the EIS or its addenda. No data is annexed to the inspection report itself. No
comparisons are made with data in the EIS or its addenda.*** Furthermore, according
to the Claimant, it was prepared without the participation of key technical departments
that were required to participate as a matter of Venezuelan law, specifically the Forestry
Department and the Ministry of Environment in Bolivar State.*77

In conclusion, even if it were a genuine document (which the Claimant denies), the
Technical Inspection Report cannot form the basis for a permitting decision.

ii. The Permit denial letter was defective on its own terms.

The Claimant additionally contends that the Permit denial letter of 14 April 2008 was
defective in its own terms. The Claimant addresses the reasons mentioned in the letter
for which the Permit was denied by the Ministry of Environment, and makes the
following observations.

a. Mining in the Imataca Forest Reserve. The Claimant recalls that the Imataca
Forest Reserve had been expressly designated for mining and forestry use in the
Presidential Decrees of 1997, 2002 and 2004.** Therefore, there was no reasonable
or rational basis to assert that the Las Cristinas mine should be halted for the
purpose of “preserving the environment in the Imataca Forestry Reserve”.** It is
noteworthy, the Claimant argues, that the Permit denial letter makes reference to
“the Decree” when justifying the alleged problems in the project, without clearly
identifying which Decree precisely it is referring to.**° Furthermore, the fact that

the Las Cristinas mine was given to CITIC/Minera to develop in 2012 shows that
29 337

this excuse is “frivolous and arbitrary”.
Global warming. Crystallex argues that nowhere on the administrative file (except
in Exhibit R-52) is there any analysis of the issue of global warming or carbon
emissions in relation to the Las Cristinas project.?** And even in that document, no
attempt was made to include any kind of scientific data or analysis (e.g., carbon
emissions analysis, etc.).°?

Effects of illegal mining on the environment. For the Claimant, the Permit denial
letter makes no attempt to explain how Crystallex and the project described in its
EIS could possibly be to blame for the actions of the illegal miners, nor why the
proposed properly constructed industrial mine would not improve the
environmental situation.*“°

. Alteration to hydrology. The Claimant contends that no criticism was raised about
Crystallex’s hydrology plans by the Ministry of Environment in its letter to the
CVG of 16 May 2007. Furthermore, Crystallex points out that on 27 March 2007,
Ms. Laura Paredes of the Ministry of Mines informed Crystallex that she had
learned from the Ministry of Environment that it was satisfied with the documents
it had received.**! Not a single document exists, in the Claimant’s view, on the
record to show that, at some time between 16 May 2007 and 14 April 2008, the
Ministry of Environment commissioned a technical report re-analyzing the
approach to hydrology described in Crystallex’s EIS or the other documents it had
produced up to including February 2007. Also in this respect, the Claimant
concludes, the Permit denial is arbitrary, illogical, unsupported and procedurally
irregular.>??

Threat to biodiversity. The Claimant argues that not a single specific reference is
made to a page of Crystallex’s EIS or its addenda — including the 470-page
biodiversity report. The letter refers to “research carried out by specialists
competent in the matter”, without, however, referring to any facts, data or figures
in the administrative file.*** The Claimant points out that the measures approved in
the 16 May 2007 letter include a “surface water quality protection program”, a

“ground water quality protection program”, a “soil quality protection program”, an
“erosion control and drainage management plan”, a “forest resource protection and
use program” and a “wildlife protection program”.*# Even if the Ministry had re-
visited Crystallex’s biodiversity studies at some time prior to April 2008 and
concluded that further work was required, a proportionate response would have
been to ask that such work be carried out. Outright rejection of the Permit was
utterly disproportionate.*4°

f. Need for public consultation. Crystallex submits that it engaged in extensive
consultations with the local communities and indigenous population over the
course of several years. In 2005, Crystallex submitted the Social Investment Plan,
which covered the results of those consultations.*#° In February 2007, Crystallex
had provided the Ministry of Environment with a comprehensive report assessing
its performance of the Social Investment Plan.*47 The Claimant submits that no
reasons were given in the Permit denial letter as to why the extensive public
consultations already carried out by Crystallex were defective, and no facts, data
or figures were provided in this respect.*#*

g. Plan for small miners’ relocation. According to the Claimant, the Permit denial
letter avoids addressing any specific element of Crystallex’ EIS in this respect.
Crystallex claims that it had submitted plans for dealing with the small miners and
the indigenous communities.*”

g.  Crystallex provided all the information it was asked to provide

290.  Crystallex argues that Venezuela’s contention that the Claimant failed to provide
information that had been “consistently requested” by the Venezuelan authorities is not
even mentioned in the Permit denial letter.4° In any event, the record shows that
Crystallex consistently satisfied the requests for information it had received and that, at
the time of the approval of the EIS in May 2007, it had fully responded to all of the

Ministry of Environment’s outstanding requests.*°! This, in the Claimant’s view,
explains why the EIS was approved and a promise made to “hand over’ the
environmental Permit in May 2007 upon presentation of the bond.*>?

In particular, Crystallex contends that it had resolved most of the issues to the
satisfaction of the Ministry of Environment in Bolivar State in 2004, before the
reviewing process passed to the office in Caracas.*°* Furthermore, the Claimant argues
that the Ministry in Caracas took two years even to distribute key documents internally
between the different departments which were supposed to review the EIS according to
their area of expertise.*** With specific regard to the 22 December 2006 meeting, on
which Venezuela relies, Crystallex responded in February 2007 by submitting the
requested information.*°>

The Claimant points to the letter of 27 March 2007, in which Ms. Paredes confirmed
that the Ministry of Environment had received the information provided by Crystallex
in response to each of the Ministry’s requests made on 22 December 2006, with the
sole exception of one document relating to copper,*° which was subsequently duly
provided by Crystallex on 25 April 2007.7°7

Finally, Crystallex contends that the so-called Equator Principles are not relevant to the
resolution of this dispute. These principles are, according to the Claimant, an “adaptive
environmental and social risk-based guidance framework, used by financial institutions
to make lending decisions on project financing”.*** The Claimant notes that between
2004 and 2008, when Crystallex’s EIS was under review by the Ministry of
Environment, Crystallex was not actively engaged in submitting a proposal for project
finance to an international lender?

Furthermore, the Equator Principles are not part of Venezuelan law, and, thus, it is not
surprising that the guidelines are not referred to in any of Venezuela’s internal
documents relating to the EIS or in any of Venezuelan’s communications with
Crystallex. Consequently, when it comes to judging whether the actions of the Ministry

of Environment in denying the Permit were justified at the time the decision was made,
the Equator Principles have no relevance.*”

In any event, the project was, in the Claimant’s view, fully compliant with the Equator
Principles, and would therefore have qualified for project financing had Crystallex

sought to apply for such financing.**!

h. After the Permit Denial, Crystallex’s due process rights were ignored

According to the Claimant, the fact that the Permit denial letter lacked all of the data,
figures, supporting documents and other attributes it was legally required to have
pursuant to Venezuelan law, deprived the Claimant of its due process right, because it
prevented it from making its case once it chose to challenge the decision.*

In addition, Crystallex’s rights of due process were denied when it sought to challenge
the Permit denial.*® First, when it launched the recourse for reconsideration, it was
denied the right to respond because it was told by the Director-General of the
Administrative Office of Permissions at the Ministry of Environment that it had no
standing because it was purportedly not domiciled in Venezuela, something which the
Claimant contends is transparently false.**

Second, when Crystallex mounted a hierarchical appeal against the Ministry’s refusal
to recognize its standing, Venezuela violated Crystallex’s due process rights again
through its failure to respond to the hierarchical appeal.*®

i. The inconsistent statements and reassurances by Venezuelan authorities
following the Permit denial

Following the Permit denial, Crystallex claims that Venezuela subjected it to a
“rollercoaster of political mistreatment” that eventually culminated in the rescission of
the MOC in February 2011.56 While Crystallex was given assurances in private about
the permitting process, other Government officials, including President Chavez

himself, made inconsistent announcements that Las Cristinas would be “taken back”
and developed by the State or with a partner of a different nationality.*°”

300. On the one hand, Crystallex contends that the Ministry of Environment reopened the
permitting decision shortly after the Permit denial.*°* For example, on 20 August 2008,
Vice-Minister Merly Garcia wrote to Crystallex, giving the appearance that the
Ministry was still deciding whether to issue the Permit, and stated that:

“[H]aving fully studied [Crystallex’s proposal], which tends to adhere to
Government guidelines in both environmental and social matters, this Office
considers that it is viable for our technicians to evaluate same with a view to
the decision the Ministry must take on the Las Cristinas Gold Project”.

301. Crystallex claims that Venezuela also continued to confirm that the conditions for the
Permit were fulfilled. For example, senior representatives of the Ministry of Mines
appeared at a hearing before the Permanent Committee for Economic Development of
the National Assembly in June 2008, confirming that Crystallex was in compliance with
the procedural and administrative requirements necessary to receive the Permit.*”° The
Permanent Committee’s post-hearing report noted that prior to the Permit’s denial,
Crystallex had received longstanding support from the Venezuelan Government.*”!

302. | Onthe other hand, Venezuelan Government officials publicly announced their intention

to take back the value of the right to mine Las Cristinas.*”” The position of the Claimants
as to the key developments in these respect is summarized in the following paragraphs.

i. July 2008-October 2010: Key events and announcements

303. In 2008, President Chavez and President Putin decided to create a joint venture, called
VenRus, to develop gold mines in the Imataca Reserve. The joint venture agreement,
signed by Minister of Mines Rodolfo Sanz and a Russian-managed company, Rusoro,
was signed in July 2008.>”? VenRus was then incorporated on 29 September 2008.°7*

In September 2008, President Chavez publicly announced that:

“In Guayana for example, we are taking back big mines, and one of them is
one of the biggest in the world. And do you know what it is? It’s gold, it’s
gold!”

For the Claimant, given the unique nature of the mine, it is self-evident that President
Chavez could only have been referring to Las Cristinas.*”°

On 5 November 2008, Minister Sanz announced, in an official press release, that the
Government would take back Las Cristinas from Crystallex:

“(T]he Las Cristinas mine, which used to be managed by transnational
company Crystallex, is expected to begin being exploited in 2009. [...] [T]he
mine will be reclaimed and operated by the State. [...] As a result of the
financial crisis spreading worldwide, we must try to recover our gold in order
to increase our international reserves”.*””
Crystallex points out that the press release did not refer to any of the concerns which
had been mentioned in the Permit denial letter.>”8

On 6 November 2008, at a presentation to a Russian Government delegation which
press agency Reuters attended, Minister Sanz explained that the Government would
enter into an agreement with Rusoro to operate both the Las Cristinas and Las Brisas
project in an effort to develop closer ties with Russia and increase mining input in light
of tumbling crude prices. According to the Reuters press release, Minister Sanz stated
that:

“We have to rescind our relationship with a company that has been working
in the zone. [...] We have a legal problem there. [...] the memorandum would
not mention Las Cristinas and Brisas by name for legal reasons. [...] “You

can be sure that those will be the deposits’, he told the delegation”.*”

Thereafter, Crystallex claims to have held a positive meeting with Adan Chavez, the
brother of President Hugo Chavez, about a possible joint venture between Crystallex
and the Venezuelan Government.**°

However, in his annual address to the Venezuelan people before the National Assembly
in January 2009, President Chavez stated that:

“[T]his year the Venezuelan State has taken over the exploitation and control
of the gold deposits of Las Cristinas. [...] [W]e have created this year (2008)
the mixed company Venrts, with Russia, [...] a mixed company for the
deposits of Las Cristinas”.**!

Again, Crystallex contends, no mention was made of environmental concerns relating
to mining in the Imataca Forest Reserve, global warming or any of the other issues
raised in the Permit denial letter.**”

However, on 22 January 2009, Reuters reported the following statement by Minister
Sanz:

“When asked whether Crystallex would leave the project, after having waited
years for environmental permits to develop it, the Minster stated that ‘I did
not say that’. ‘When we have made a decision we will communicate it to
whomever it must be communicated’ he added”.**3

On 2 March 2009, Crystallex received yet further assurances from the CVG that the
MOC remained in full force and effect, that it had fully complied with its obligations
and that the project was in the process of obtaining the required permits:

“Taking into account that [...] Crystallex has been fulfilling the obligations
assumed under the contract, we hereby inform you that the contract is fully
valid and in the process of obtaining the required permits from the competent

authorities for the initiation of the development of the Project”.*™*

In April 2010, during his weekly talk show “Al6 Presidente”, President Chavez stated:

“Tf we are going to exploit gold we will have to nationalize all of it,
recuperate and put an end to concessions which led to degeneration”.**>
In May 2010, Crystallex claims that it sought to partner with an entity of a nationality
that would be acceptable to the Government in order to move forward with the Las
Cristinas project. It thus engaged in talks with China Rail, a Chinese State company.**°

In August 2010, the CVG confirmed again that Crystallex’s MOC was in full force and
effect and requested further information from Crystallex regarding the proposed
association with China Rail.**”

However, in October 2010, President Chavez travelled to Belarus accompanied by
Minister of Mines José Khan. The President of Venezuela announced that:

“Las Cristinas, this mine belongs to Venezuela and it has been handed over
to transnational companies. I announce to the world that the revolutionary
Government recuperated it, together with the Las Brisas mine. These mineral
resources are for the Venezuelan people, not for transnationals [...] ”.°**

ii. The controversial “VenRus Presentation” of late 2010: Exhibit C-439

According to the Claimant, in late 2010, around the time of the President’s trip to
Belarus, a presentation surfaced titled “Project Proposal ‘Brisas de Las Cristinas’”.**°
The presentation’s cover page bears the official logos of the Ministry of Mines, the
State Mining company “Minera Nacional” and VenRus (the Venezuelan joint-venture
with Rusoro), as well as the logo of Venezuela’s “bicentenary of independence”. In
response to the suggestion by Venezuela and some of its witnesses that the powerpoint
presentation may have been prepared by Rusoro, the Claimant points out that Rusoro’s
logo does not appear anywhere in the presentation.*”°

The Claimant contends that the presentation set forth a legal strategy for “getting rid”
of Crystallex without paying any compensation, so that Las Cristinas and the
neighbouring Las Brisas mines could be jointly developed by VenRus and Minera.*?!
Amongst other things, the presentation took aim at Crystallex being a “foreign
enterprise” domiciled in British Columbia.*” It set forth two alternative legal strategies
for rescinding its commitment to Crystallex without compensation, one of which
involved rescinding the MOC pursuant to Clause 24 of the MOC.*” According to the
Claimant, the presentation “provided a recipe for dressing up a sovereign act of
expropriation as a mere contractual act”.?**

The Claimant highlights that, at the hearing, both Ms. Paredes (the President of VenRus
at the time) and Minister Khan (the Minister of Mines at the time) admit to having
reviewed the presentation in 2010, although they both strongly denied any involvement
by either the Ministry or VenRus in the preparation of the presentation.*° Paredes
suggested that the presentation was prepared by Rusoro.**°

For the Claimant, this evidence is not credible, because it is implausible that Ms.
Paredes and Minister Khan would have tolerated a private company’s use of official
Government logos; that Rusoro, a Canadian company domiciled in British Columbia,
would cast aspersion on another mining company because of its domicile in British
Columbia; and because Rusoro was not in a position to make a presentation concerning
the interests of the Government of Venezuela, or to opine on Venezuela’s policy and
sovereignty as to national resources, as the presentation does at length.*””

For the Claimant, the presentation is a document prepared by the Venezuelan
Government, with the approval of the Ministry of Mines, reflecting the policies of the
Venezuelan Government.*”* It provides a plan to expropriate Crystallex’s rights in order
to transfer them to the VenRus joint venture, disguised as a contractual matter to seek
to avoid compensation and thus “reduce the risk of claims on [the] part of Crystallex

brought either before the national courts or international tribunals”.>?

The Claimant notes that in February 2011 Venezuela precisely implemented the
Ministry of Mines’/VenRus’ legal strategy suggested in the VenRus Presentation, when
it rescinded the MOC invoking Clause 24 of the MOC.4

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the Ministry of Environment properly and justifiably
denied Crystallex’s request for an environmental Permit in 2008 after a thorough,
technical review of all the information submitted. According to Venezuela, the denial
was based on several well-founded concerns about the proposed project’s likely
unmitigated environmental and socio-cultural impacts, which had been raised and
discussed with Crystallex since 2004. During the four-year environmental review
process, Crystallex failed to adequately assess or address these concerns and failed to
convince the Ministry that the project’s impacts would be sufficiently mitigated,
corrected and/or prevented.

According to Venezuela, during the four years in which the environmental analysis and
Permit application remained pending, the Ministry of Environment was responsive to
Crystallex. The Ministry did not delay in its answers, rather, it considered each
submission by Crystallex, analyzing whether the Claimant was responsive to the
concerns raised by its technical experts; and generally worked with the CVG and
Crystallex to achieve an impact assessment and mitigation program that would be
acceptable, yet to no avail.*°!

Venezuela submits that the Ministry’s review of Crystallex’s application was a purely
technical and apolitical process in which the Permitting Office at the Ministry solicited
input, comments, and recommendations from technicians in numerous departments
including experts in water resources, forestry, biodiversity, community impacts, and
environmental mitigation and monitoring.*°”

The Deficiencies in the Claimant’s EIS were repeatedly raised with the
Claimant since 2004

Venezuela contends that, when Crystallex submitted its EIS on 15 April 2004, it
requested an initial permit for “preliminary work construction activities for the
proposed project” to be followed by another permit for its exploitation activities (i.). At
the end of 2004, the Ministry informed Crystallex of substantial deficiencies in its
materials that would need to be corrected before any permits would be issued (i.-ii.).
Throughout the next 18 months, the Ministry held roundtable discussions with the
company, considered the company’s responses, and had its own technicians evaluate
of its conclusion that Las Cristinas had to be evaluated jointly with the adjacent Las
Brisas project in order to decrease the cumulative negative impacts on the environment
of the two neighboring projects (iv.). Crystallex did not deliver the requested additional
information and integrated analysis, and, as a result, the Ministry concluded that it had
to deny the requested permits (v.).

According to the Respondent, many contemporaneous documents show that the
relevant subdivisions of the Ministry of Environment reviewing Crystallex’s EIS
identified numerous, significant deficiencies, which were inadequately addressed by
the company.*” Thus, by no means could the Permit denial come as “a surprise” to
Crystallex.**

The next sections analyze in greater detail the Respondent’s position on the main
exchanges between Crystallex, the CVG and the Venezuelan authorities, in particular
the Ministry of Environment, on the environmental aspects of the project.

i. 2004: From Crystallex’s submission of the EIS, up to the Ministry’s
rejection on 29 December 2004

As a preliminary matter, the Respondent highlights that when Crystallex submitted its
EIS on 15 April 2004, it requested an initial permit for “construction activities for the
preliminary works of the project”,*°° to be followed by another permit for its
exploitation activities. For the Respondent, there is no evidence to support Crystallex’s
claim in the arbitration that “this request for a preliminary permit was abandoned by
CVG/Crystallex in late 2004”.4°°

Moreover, acceptance of the Placer Dome EIS was irrelevant to the environmental
review of Crystallex’s plan.*”” For Venezuela, minimal changes to an existing project
continued by the same operator will require less analysis than a new project by a new
operator based on new information many years after the original approval was sought.
The latter is the case here, as the Placer Dome/MINCA EIS had been prepared in
1997.48 Thus, in 2004, Crystallex could not rely on an old approval of an outdated
study for its new proposal to build a complex, large open-pit mine.*”

Furthermore, according to Venezuela, substantial concerns led the Ministry of
Environment to reject Crystallex’s permit request in late 2004.

As early as 31 May 2004, the Ministry of Environment set out its first set of technical
observations to Crystallex’s proposed EIS.*!° The Ministry raised concerns regarding
water issues, the diversion channel, the lack of proper forestry inventory, the problem
of illegal miners, and social issues more generally. Venezuela submits that every single
one of these critiques also appears in the April 2008 Permit denial.*!!

Similar concerns were raised by the Ministry of Environment in a meeting with
Crystallex that took place on 23 September 2004.*!? The Ministry’s questions and

concerns prompted, according to Venezuela, the preparation of Addendum 2 of the
EIs.4!

335. On 29 December 2004, the Ministry of Environment communicated its rejection of the
EIS documentation that Crystallex had submitted up to that point.*'* The Ministry asked
for a reformulation of the project (and not just of its terms of reference, as argued by
the Claimant) in order to minimize environmental impacts, highlighting various
concerns regarding the proposed project and the inadequacy of Crystallex’s EIS.*'>

336. The Ministry pointed at Crystallex’s insufficient or entirely lacking data. It noted that
Crystallex had failed to adequately identify the flora and fauna present in the area; that
the proposal lacked the necessary mitigating preventive, or corrective measures related
to the tailings pond, water diversion channel, landfill, and incinerator; that Crystallex
had only assessed the impact of the proposed tailings pond “with respect to the area’s
deforestation process, yet never examining the interaction of this pond with the
surrounding environment”; and that Crystallex had not adequately addressed the social
impacts of its plans on illegal and small-scale miners nor planned to include them in
the area of its operations.*!©

ii. 2005: Key developments

337. | The Respondent submits that during 2005, the Ministry provided substantial feedback
to Crystallex by holding workshops with company representatives to discuss different
concerns about the EIS through the year.*!”

338. In the framework of these workshops, the Ministry of Environment reiterated its
concerns regarding certain aspects of the Las Cristinas project and its possible
environmental and social impacts.*!® These meetings, according to Venezuela, were
necessary because the Ministry was not satisfied with the responses and addenda it had
received in 2004 from Crystallex.*!? In these interactions with the Claimant, the
Ministry requested several additional items from the company, including the Social

Investment Plan; the Manual for the Application of Natural Physical Measures; updated

for the Permit denial in the 2008 letter.‘7!

339. | For example, at a roundtable discussion on 18 April 2005, the parties agreed to set up
three technical commissions to follow-up on specific aspects:*?* (i) environmental
quality;*? (ii) socio-cultural aspects;4** and (iii) water, biodiversity, and forestry.4”°

  

iii. 2006: The Technical Inspection Report (Exhibit R-52)

340. During 2006, according to the Respondent, personnel from the Ministry visited the site,
reiterated the same concerns discussed above, and went so far as to internally
recommend the denial of the Permit.

341. In particular, in July 2006, the Permissions Office of the Ministry of Environment
prepared a summary on the review process, highlighting that there was no clear solution
to the social problems concerning the small-scale illegal miners, nor a clear definition
regarding the inclusion of indigenous communities in the project.*7°

342. In September 2006, Pedro Romero and other experts from the Ministry of Environment
visited the Las Cristinas site and prepared a report summarizing their findings (the
“Technical Inspection Report”, Exhibit R-52). This report raised the concerns that were
later echoed in the April 2008 Permit denial. The report recommended that the
Ministry’s Permissions Office should deny the Permit requested for Crystallex’s
proposed project.*?

343. According to the Respondent, the Technical Inspection Report was prepared with the
collaboration of a multidisciplinary technical team.*”* The Respondent highlights that
the report provided several reasons for its conclusions that the proposed project should
not be permitted. These included the issues related to small miners, deforestation,

Reserve, and social issues related to the introduction of thousands of new workers to
the area.*”? It also discussed concerns about water,**” issues relating to the exploitation
of copper,**! and plans to mitigate acid rock drainage.*?

iv. 2006 (cont’d): The Ministry’s concerns with regard to the cumulative
impacts of Las Cristinas and Las Brisas (Gold Reserve)

According to the Respondent, the second half of 2006 was dedicated to discussions
between not only Crystallex and the Ministry, but also Gold Reserve, regarding the
cumulative impacts of the Las Cristinas and Las Brisas projects and the need for
cooperation between the companies to minimize and mitigate unacceptable
environmental and social impacts.**

On 31 July 2006, the Ministry of Environment notified Crystallex and Gold Reserve of
the need to conduct a Strategic Environmental Evaluation (or “EAE” by its Spanish
initials).** An EAE is a planning tool prepared by the Venezuelan State, which
however requires certain joint analysis and evaluation by the affected project
developers.**> Venezuela explains that the Ministry of Environment considered it
necessary to carefully analyze the cumulative impacts of both the Las Cristinas and Las
Brisas projects and to conduct a Strategic Environmental Evaluation before either
project could be fully permitted.**°

On 17-18 October 2006, the Ministry of Environment coordinated two days of meetings
with Crystallex, the CVG, Gold Reserve, their consultants, and the Embassy of Canada
as part of a “Venezuelan-Canadian Business Forum” held in Porlamar, Venezuela (the
“Porlamar meeting”).**’ In this context, the Ministry emphasized that while it would
consider the requests for permits independently, the environmental authorizations for
both projects were counting upon a coordinated effort to minimize environmental and
social impacts.**8

On 19 December 2006, the Ministry of Environment sent essentially the same letter to
both Crystallex and Gold Reserve, indicating its concerns regarding the significant
likely impacts of the two projects, outlining certain requirements of the EAE, and
calling for a meeting to take place on 22 December 2006.4”

In the 22 December 2006 meeting with the two mining companies, according to
Venezuela, the Ministry of Environment committed to a phased permit approach: (1) a
“priority permitting process” in which it would issue preliminary Permits for both the
Las Cristinas and Las Brisas projects within three months, if its requirements were
satisfied by the project proponents; and (2) a “medium-term” schedule in which
authorization for at least some of the other elements of both projects (i.e., everything
not listed in the “short-term” category) might be expected in “approximately 3
years”. In other words, Venezuela contends that the Ministry promised a partial
permit in three months, but required significant information for further analysis of
Crystallex’s plans and the likely impacts before it would grant an exploitation permit
to Crystallex.*#! According to the minutes, the Ministry demanded, inter alia, a joint
hydrological evaluation for Las Cristinas and Las Brisas, as well as a joint analysis of
the socio-cultural impacts of the two projects, a “joint social investment plan” (one part
of which was to focus on indigenous peoples), a comprehensive Environmental
Supervision Plan, and supplemental information on Crystallex’s plans regarding the use
of copper.”

v. 2007: Crystallex’s inadequate feedback to the 22 December 2006
meeting requests

Venezuela submits that the materials that Crystallex submitted in early 2007 in response
to the concerns raised in the 22 December 2006 meeting either completely ignored or
inadequately addressed the Ministry’s requests.‘4* The Respondent makes the
following observations:

350. With regard to the joint hydrology report, which the Ministry had requested Crystallex
and Gold Reserve to submit, Crystallex’s report submitted on 16 February 2007
contained no joint evaluation or analysis.“+

351. With regard to social issues, Venezuela stresses that the minutes of the 22 December
2006 meeting confirm that the Ministry requested an “integrated analysis of the
assessment of the socio-cultural impact of the two projects together” and an evaluation
of the “Joint Social Investment Plan”.“4> Nevertheless, the report on socio-cultural
impacts which Crystallex submitted in February 2007 was not an integrated analysis of
the cumulative impacts of the two proposed projects.*#° Furthermore, specific issues or
concerns identified by the Ministry (such as gender inequalities, local indigenous
culture and traditions, and incorporation of small miners) were inadequately
addressed.*4”

352. Furthermore, Crystallex simply ignored the Ministry’s request for a full
“Environmental Supervision Plan”, which was to consider every level of environmental
impact for the project, the corresponding preventative, mitigating or corrective
measures, as well as funding aspects.*48 Instead, it re-submitted the construction
environmental supervision plan and the related Manual.”

353. Finally, also Crystallex’s submissions relating to copper were inadequate.*”

354. Thus, Venezuela concludes, the Ministry over four years gave Crystallex ample
opportunity to make the necessary changes to the project, which Crystallex failed to
make.

b. The EIS was never approved and the promised Permit, if anything, was
limited to preliminary works and exploration

never fully approved, i.e., the Ministry never found that the environmental and socio-

cultural impacts of the proposed Las Cristinas project, coupled with proposed
preventative and mitigating measures, would be tolerable.**!

For Venezuela, the supposed approval of Crystallex’s EIS only related to preliminary
works and could only have led to the issuance of an equally limited preliminary Permit.
‘Venezuela explains that when, in April 2004, Crystallex, through the CVG, submitted
to the Ministry of Environment its EIS requesting the full Permit for exploitation to be
issued, it also requested that a preliminary AARN be issued with urgency for certain
preliminary works.*>

The Respondent highlights that Crystallex’s request of 15 April 2004 stressed “the need
to start preliminary work on site in accordance with the work schedule established
between the CVG and Crystallex” and asked the Ministry of Environment “to process
with some urgency the authorization to use natural resources in [seven specified]
preliminary work construction activities for the [proposed] project”, including
extension of access roads, construction of a diversion channel, and others.*>* The letter
informed the Ministry that the planned start date for the aforementioned preliminary
works was the beginning of May of 2004, i.e. one month later.

For Venezuela, there is no indication that Crystallex or the CVG requested the “urgent”
issuance of a Permit with respect to the key facts of its proposed project, such as the
construction of the open pits, the processing of extracted materials, and the proposed
“tailing dams” (i.e., deposits locations for the waste generated through the processing
of extracted materials).4*

The fact that in their 15 April 2004 letter, Crystallex and the CVG asked to be allowed
to begin work at Las Cristinas only one month later, i.e. in May 2004, shows that this
request for urgent approval was limited to certain “preliminary works” only, as
Crystallex could not have expected the Ministry of Environment to perform the review
of the full 900+page EIS, with a view to granting a Permit for exploitation, in one month
only.455

For the Respondent, throughout 2005 and 2006, Crystallex’s focus continued to be on
a preliminary Permit, not a Permit for the operation and exploitation of the mine. This
is evidenced by the submission of an “Environmental Supervision Plan” in September
2004 which, according to Venezuela, related exclusively to the same preliminary

construction-type works for which Crystallex was seeking urgent approval.**° Further,
the October 2005 supplement to such Environmental Supervision Plan focused again,
in Venezuela’s view, exclusively on preliminary works.*°

361. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, at the above-mentioned 22 December 2006
meeting, an agreement was reached as to a “phased permitting approach”.** That is,
first, a “priority permitting process” was to be pursued, in which the Ministry would
issue a preliminary Permit (if the requirements were satisfied), which the Respondent
contends would relate only to preliminary works.**? The permitting process relating to
the proper exploitation phase at Las Cristinas was, to the contrary, meant to be carried
out at a later stage.“ And in a February 2007 communication from Crystallex to the
Ministry, so argues the Respondent, Crystallex confirmed that it was presenting
information for two separate Permits, one for service works and one for exploitation.*°!

362. It is against this backdrop, Venezuela contends, that the 16 May 2007 letter should be
correctly interpreted. The letter did not approve the full EIS, as Crystallex contends. A
project accreditation would be much longer and much more detailed than a three-page
letter. The 16 May 2007 letter is thus simply a request for a performance bond. In the
Respondent’s view, the statement whereby the environmental protection and mitigation
measures proposed in Crystallex’s EIS “have been analyzed and approved by this
Office”, is necessarily limited by the letter’s subject matter. Indeed, the letter related to
the request for a limited, preliminary Permit for the constructing of infrastructure and
services, as well as exploration, not for a Permit authorizing the entire Las Cristinas
project.4°

363. In the Respondent’s view, there is no mention anywhere in the 16 May 2007 letter of
the actual construction or exploitation of the Las Cristinas pits, much less the processing
of extracted materials, disposal or water treatment issues, or the closure of the mine
once exploitation has finished, all of which are crucial elements of mining projects
which must be assessed before a mining project can be fully authorized.* Venezuela

points to the fact that the letter states its limited focus in two separate places, in which
it mentions “exploration” (as opposed to “exploitation”).4©

Thus, Venezuela concludes, Crystallex only ever received, at most, a partial approval
of its EIS.4°°

As the approval of the EIS was limited in scope (to preliminary works), so was, in
Venezuela’s view, the corresponding payment of the bond and related taxes requested
by the Ministry of Environment in its 16 May 2007 letter.4°”

According to the Respondent, the fact that the bonds requested (and later paid by
Crystallex) as well as the environmental taxes related only to preliminary works, is
confirmed by the following other documents on the record.

First, on 16 May 2007, the same day the Ministry of Environment requested the Bond,
it also wrote to the CVG to request the payment of a tax totaling Bs. 3,940,070 (at the
time equal to approximately US$1,835) “for issuance of the [AARN] for implementing
activities associated with the project, ‘Construction of Infrastructure and Services and
Gold Ore Exploration Stage for the Las Cristinas Project’”.4%

Second, on 17 May 2007, the day after it received the two 16 May 2007 letters from
the Ministry of Environment, the CVG forwarded those letters to Crystallex.4 The
Spanish original of the CVG’s 17 May 2007 letter includes only the general phrase that
the bond and taxes were requested to continue the application process for the
“Autorizacion de Afectacién de los Recursos Naturales del Proyecto Minero Las
Cristinas” 47° There is no mention, according to Venezuela, to “exploitation”. Rather,
the CVG letter of 17 May 2007 made clear that the AARN at issue, and, therefore, the
related bond and taxes described in the letters, were limited to the preliminary work of
infrastructure and services construction and exploration.*”!

Third, a review of the actual bond purchased by Crystallex states that the environmental
measures it guarantees are those “that are contemplated in the environmental impact
evaluation of the CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND
SERVICES AND FOR THE EXPLORATION STAGE OF GOLD, LAS CRISTINAS

PROJECT”.*” Nowhere does the bond say anything about the actual construction of
the mine itself, much less its exploitation.47*

Fourth, when Crystallex wrote, on 30 May 2007, to the CVG inquiring about the status
of the process before the Ministry for the granting of the AARN it referred to “the
Authorization to Affect Natural Resources for the execution of activities associated
with the Project for the ‘Construction of Infrastructure and Services for the Gold
Exploration Stage for the Las Cristinas Project’”.*”*

In view of all these documents making reference to “exploration”, Crystallex’s
argument that the 16 May 2007 letter simply contained a typographical error is, for the
Respondent, untenable.47>

Finally, with regard to the “draft Permit” which Crystallex alleges to have received
around the time it received the 16 May 2007 letter, Venezuela points to the fact that this
is an undated and unsigned document.” For Venezuela, “Tw]hatever this document is,
and Venezuela does not concede that it is a Ministry document, and however Claimant
obtained it, it has no value”.*7””

c.  Crystallex did not have a “right” to receive the Permit

Venezuela also argues that, even when a project proponent has received approval of its
EIS, produced a bond and paid certain taxes, it is not necessarily guaranteed a permit.*”8
For the Respondent, it is disingenuous for Crystallex to suggest that it expected the
Ministry of Environment’s May 2007 partial approval of the EIS, together with its own
posting of a limited bond and payment of equivalently limited taxes, to necessarily
result in the issuance of a much broader Permit for exploitation.*”? Venezuela points to
the fact that in August 2007, some three months after receiving the Ministry’s May
2007 letter, posting the bond, and paying the taxes, Crystallex reported to the SEC that
there was “no assurance as to when or if the Permit [would] be granted”.*8°

Furthermore, even after receiving the full Permit, Crystallex would have been required
to secure additional environmental permits in order to lawfully operate the mine (e.g.,

a water concession, and environmental quality permits in relation to the mine’s
discharges to air, water and land). Thus, according to Venezuela, the Claimant was still
very much at the starting line with respect to the environmental permitting.**!

d. ‘The Permit was properly and justifiably denied

375. | The Respondent submits that the Ministry of Environment’s decision not to grant the
Permit for exploitation of the Las Cristinas project was reasonable, as it denied the
Permit on specific grounds previously identified and never adequately addressed by
Crystallex.**?

376. The Respondent highlights that Crystallex proposed to construct a massive open pit
gold mine that would significantly alter both the landscape and the life of the people
that inhabit the project area. Moreover, the adjacency to another massive mining project
(Las Brisas/Gold Reserve) involved an even larger cumulative impact on the
environment and on the local community.***

377. Furthermore, the Las Cristinas project was to take place in an uniquely sensitive and
complex environment, which created complications for the environmentally and
socially responsible development of the site. In particular, the Respondent points to the
following complications: (i) the significant water issues, deriving from the fact that Las
Cristinas is located in an extremely wet area;*** (ii) the abundant biodiversity, deriving
from Las Cristinas’ location in the Imataca Forest Reserve;**> (iii) the presence of
indigenous communities;**° and (iv) the problem of the thousands of small-scale illegal

487 According to Venezuela, Crystallex failed to address these problems to the

satisfaction of the Ministry of Environment or pursuant to international standards.

miners.

 

378. In view of these challenges, the Ministry of Environment was obliged to review the
project carefully, only approving it once Crystallex had adequately demonstrated that
it would not cause unacceptable environmental or social impacts.*** Upon review, it
concluded that the environmental and socio-cultural impact of the project proposed by
Crystallex could not be mitigated and that its authorization would have been a violation

of the Venezuelan government’s obligation to “ensure protection of the environment

and the population from situations that constitute imminent damages” .**°

For the Respondent, the April 2008 denial expressly mentioned many factors that
render the Las Cristinas site an especially sensitive and complicated area to successfully
develop a mining project in conformity with the requirements of environment and social
protection.” For example, the Ministry mentioned specific worries regarding water
management and the consideration of biodiversity;**! social issues concerning the

indigenous communities;*”” and the problem of small-scale illegal miners.*??

For the Respondent, the Ministry of Environment did communicate these legitimate
concerns during the extended EIS review process that ultimately culminated in the
Permit denial, and provided Claimant ample opportunity to respond.*** Venezuela
further highlights that not every inspection or analysis by Ministry technicians resulted
in a written report.‘

Finally, the Respondent takes issue with the Claimant’s reliance on the conclusions and
recommendations of the Permanent Commission of Economic Development of the
National Assembly of 4 October 2007.4 First, Venezuela stresses that this commission
does not have any authority in respect of the grant of permits, which lies solely with the
Ministry of Environment.*%” Furthermore, any views expressed at that meeting by Ms.
Paredes (an official from the Ministry of Mines, and not from the Ministry of
Environment) are irrelevant to any determination of whether or not an environmental
permit can or should be granted.*** Finally, the representative of the Ministry of
Environment present at that meeting did nothing more than “refer in general to
environmental matters”, as the minutes record.”

e. The Ministry of Environment’s concerns were legitimate under
international standards

Venezuela recalls that in the MOC, Crystallex agreed to develop Las Cristinas in
accordance with international standards.*” Furthermore, even after signing the MOC,
Crystallex continued to assure both Venezuela and the market of its commitment to
develop Las Cristinas in compliance with international standards.*°! For Venezuela the
relevant standards are the Equator Principles, the World Bank Standards, and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards. Referring to the
evaluations by its environmental experts, Venezuela contends that the materials
submitted by Crystallex in this case were very far from complying with these
standards.°°

In particular, Venezuela submits, referring to its experts’ opinions, that the Claimant
did not submit a resettlement plan; its supposed closure plans did not comply with
international standards; Crystallex did not identify a post-construction floodplain or
address the potential flood risks in and around the proposed mine facilities; its EIS was
inconsistent with its other mine plans; and its biodiversity “baseline and impact” studies
did not conform to international standards.°°?

It was thus clearly prudent and reasonable to deny the Permit given that the provided
documents did not measure up to industry best practices or the applicable international
standards.°*

f. After the Permit denial, Crystallex failed to assert its rights

It is Venezuela’s submission that Crystallex’s request for reconsideration and
hierarchical appeal of the Permit denial were adjudicated in full compliance with
Venezuelan law and without any form of discrimination or unfair treatment.°°

With regard to the request for reconsideration, which was denied by the Director
General of the Ministry of Environment’s Administrative Office of Permits on 29 May

2008,°°° Venezuela posits that the issue of whether Crystallex (which did not receive a
concession and thus had no mining title) had standing to seek reconsideration on its
own was and remains an open legal issue under Venezuelan law, over which jurists and
Ministry officials might reasonably disagree.>”

387. In any event, to the extent Crystallex believed that the Director General’s conclusions
were erroneous as a matter of fact or law, it had every opportunity to challenge and
appeal those conclusions, which Crystallex did through its hierarchical appeal.*°*

388. | With regard to the Ministry’s failure to issue a decision on the hierarchical appeal
within 90 days, Venezuela contends that such failure would entitle an appellant to
consider the appeal denied and pursue additional relief, including by filing a claim with
Venezuelan administrative courts, which the Claimant failed to do. The Respondent
and its expert, Prof. Iribarren, explain that Venezuelan administrative procedural law
expressly provides that a party has the right to judicial appeals when an administrative
process has denied [an application] “or a decision has failed to be arrived at within the
appropriate time period”.>!”

g. Events following the Permit denial
i. The Ministry did not reopen the permitting process

389. | Venezuela contends that following the Permit denial there is no document evidencing
a decision on the part of the Ministry of Environment to reopen the review process for
Crystallex’s Permit.*!! In particular, in the 20 August 2008 letter, on which the
Claimant relies, Vice-Minister Garcia told Crystallex that a report which the company
had submitted two weeks before would be useful “in making a decision regarding
whether to take on the ‘Las Cristinas’ Gold Project”.>! However, for the Respondent,
Vice-Minister Garcia was referring to the specific decision concerning the pending
hierarchical appeal of the denial of the Permit, and not to the broader review of the
Permit application.>!

In any event, nothing in this communication would suggest that there would be a
guarantee that a Permit would be issued. Rather, the communication made very clear
that the “decision” to be made by the Ministry remained subject to further review.>'*

ii. The “VenRus Presentation” is not a Government document

Venezuela finally contends that the Claimant mischaracterizes the nature and purpose
of the so-called “VenRus Presentation”, which for the Respondent should not be
attached any value.*!> For the Respondent, the presentation was created not by the
Ministry of Mines or any Government agency, but rather by Rusoro, a private Canadian
mining company.>!® In Venezuela’s view, Rusoro was seeking to market itself and its
joint venture subsidiary, VenRus, as an entity that could successfully reboot the
development of both the Las Brisas and Las Cristinas together.>!” This document was
thus not a strategy document produced by the Ministry of Mines, but rather a sales pitch
to the Ministry of Mines.>!® Therefore, the Respondent concludes that the document
does not in any way reflect the intentions or strategy of the Ministry of Mines or the

THE RESCISSION OF THE MOC
1. The Claimant’s Position
a. The rescission was not based on any legitimate contractual ground

For the Claimant, the rescission of the MOC was a politically motivated act confirmed
by Venezuela’s political maneuvering with VenRus and its plan to take Las Cristinas
from Crystallex.*?° Furthermore, it was anchored in Venezuela’s desire to utilize
Crystallex’s investments at a time when gold prices had risen from US$317 per ounce
when Crystallex signed the MOC to US$1,328 per ounce on 3 February 2011.57! In the
Claimant’s view, the decision was arbitrary and in violation of the most basic notions
of Venezuelan law and even the terms of the MOC.>”

According to the Claimant, Venezuela cannot rely on Clause 24, for its argument that
the MOC could legitimately be rescinded under Clause 24, whether for “paralyzation
of activities for over one year without justification”, as alleged in the 2 February 2011
CVG Resolution, or for breach of contract, as alleged by Venezuela in this arbitration.
Clause 24 reads as follows:

“This Contract may be unilaterally rescinded by the CORPORATION
without compensation to CRYSTALLEX, in the event of delay in the
commencement of performance, paralyzation of any activities or contractual
breach for a period of one (1) year without justification”.°”

First, Crystallex contends that it did not suspend or paralyze activities under the
MOC. It argues that between 2008 and 2011 it never ceased its work to keep the mine

site “shovel ready”;>*> that it continued to fulfill its social obligations towards the local

communities surrounding the campsite;>”° and that it persisted in its efforts to obtain
from the Ministry of Environment the environmental Permit.*?’ Crystallex points to the

monthly reports which it furnished to the CVG, as documenting all these activities.°**

Second, the lack of gold exploitation activities at Las Cristinas was not a “paralyzation”
of activity “without justification”.°” For the Claimant, the only “paralyzation” that
Venezuela can point to is the failure to produce gold. However, the Claimant’s inability
to begin extracting gold was solely due to the Government’s unlawful failure to grant
the environmental Permit that Crystallex needed by law in order to exploit the mine.>*°

Crystallex contends that, if Venezuela could rely solely on its failure to grant an
environmental Permit to claim “paralyzation” of activities under the MOC, the legal
protections of Clause 24 of the MOC would be rendered meaningless, since at any time
since 2003 (one year after the MOC was concluded) Venezuela could have asserted that
there was a “paralyzation” and terminated the MOC. This cannot have been what was
intended by Clause 24.**!

Third, pursuant to Clause 9.4 of the MOC the time periods under the MOC would have
started to run only after the CVG had obtained all the necessary permits. Thus, the one-
year period of Clause 24 of the MOC had not yet started to run.>*?

Furthermore, the Claimant points to communications of the CVG’s own legal
department and its Industrial Vice-Presidency both before and after the rescission to
show the “arbitrary and groundless nature of the rescission”:>*

On 15 August 2010, the CVG’s Vice-president stated, in response to a query from
Crystallex about the status of the MOC, that the MOC was in “full force and effect”.°4
Thus, the Claimant contends, if in fact the CVG believed by August 2010 that activities
under the MOC had already been paralyzed for six months (as would have had to be
the case for there to be a one-year “paralyzation” six months later in February 2011),
this should have been mentioned to Crystallex in response to its query.>*°

In an internal communication dated 28 February 2011, the legal department of the CVG
requested from its Vice-President “information [...] regarding the reasons why
Crystallex International Corporation has paralyzed activities for over one (1) year”.>*°
The legal department sought this information “in order to support the administrative
record in question”.**” The response supplied by the Vice-President of the CVG, Mr.
Colmenares, on 17 March 2011 was that Crystallex had executed all of its tasks under
the MOC with the exception of gold exploitation, as it did not have a Permit:

“[A]ccording to the reports from the Liaison Office... Crystallex
International Corporation has completed the various tasks set forth in said
Operation Contract, with the exception of the tasks corresponding to the
construction and development stage of the exploitation phase [...] due to the
fact that it was not granted the Permit [...] ”. 9 538

For the Claimant, this internal exchange further evinces that a contractual breach did
not exist even in the eyes of the CVG officers, and that “the whole basis on which the
MOC had been terminated was a sham”.5°°

402. Furthermore, Venezuela’s allegations of contractual breach (especially of breaches of
Clause 7, concerning the social obligations), made in this arbitration, are, for the
Claimant, flatly contradicted by the following documentary evidence on the record and

the testimony of Venezuela’s own witnesses:

540

On 2 July 2004, the CVG’s Vice-Presidency took note of Crystallex’s
compliance with Clause 7 of the MOC.**!

In an internal memorandum from Ms. Parades to Minister Khan of 21 November
2006, it was noted that “Crystallex in full co-ordination with the CVG, has
already complied with all its preconstruction obligations, including all the works
of social interest that were required”.**

The report of the National Assembly Economic Development Commission of
16 October 2007 recorded that “the provisions of the contract have been fully

complied with the CVG and Crystallex”.*4?

On 10 December 2007, the Ministry of Mines wrote to Crystallex that the MOC
“is being correctly performed, according to the most recent records of this

Ministry as of this date”.**

On 2 March 2009, the CVG wrote to Crystallex that Crystallex had been
fulfilling the obligations assumed under the contract, and that the contract was
fully valid.>4

On 15 August 2010, the CVG wrote to Crystallex, reaffirming that the MOC

remained “in full force and effect” *4°

The already mentioned 17 March 2011 internal communication from the CVG’s
Vice-President of Industrial Development to the CVG’s Legal Department
stated that Crystallex had “completed the various tasks set forth in said

construction and development stage of the exploitation phase [...] due to the fact

that it was not granted the Permit”.*4”

° Even in the handover minutes of 5 April 2011, it was concluded that the Clause
7 obligations “[e]xecuted in full [...] provide a foundation for Crystallex
International Corporation to affirm that the mining operations contract was
developed and complied with in full, except for the contractual obligations for
which the environmental authorization acts were required pursuant to Decree
1,257” 548

b. The rescission of the MOC is illegitimate as a matter of Venezuelan law

For the Claimant, the rescission of the MOC was illegitimate as a matter of Venezuelan
law, for the following reasons.

First, the rescission was an u/tra vires act, because the CVG’s President, Minister Khan,
had no authority to rescind the MOC without the prior approval of the CVG’s Board.
For the principle of parallelism of forms, in the same way as the MOC was approved
by the Board prior to its execution, so too the Board’s approval was required for its
termination.” The fact that Crystallex did not challenge the validity of the rescission
before the Venezuelan courts does not mean that the rescission should be presumed
valid. The presumption of validity of administrative acts under Venezuelan law does
not apply when the act in question is u/tra vires.°

Second, the rescission violated Crystallex’s due process rights, because no
administrative procedure was initiated prior to the rescission, as required under
Venezuelan law.*>!

Third, the rescission was based on a false supposition of fact (falso supuesto de hecho),
as there was no factual basis on which Venezuela could allege that Crystallex had
paralyzed its activities under the MOC.>> It was also based on a false supposition of
law, in that it ignored that the Permit denial letter had legally prevented Crystallex from
exploiting the Las Cristinas mine.

Finally, the Claimant argues that the rescission frustrated the principle of legitimate
expectations (confianza legitima);>* was defectively reasoned;>°> and constituted a
deviation of power, because its genuine motive was to allow the Venezuelan
Government to take for itself the increased value of the gold at Las Cristinas and to
pursue the development of the mine through a partnership with an entity from a “sister
nation”.°°° It further violated the principles of reasonableness, proportionality, and
minimum intervention, because the grounds invoked in the rescission — paralyzation of
activities, and reasons of opportunity and convenience — are mutually exclusive and
irreconcilable,*°’ and because under the MOC, the CVG was required to explore
alternative means before terminating the MOC and did not do so.>**

  
  

 

2. The Respondent’s Position

a. The rescission of the MOC was a contractual exercise consistent with
Venezuelan law

For Venezuela, the rescission of the MOC was an act of contractual nature performed
by the President of the CVG in the exercise of his powers and arising from the prior
breach of contract by the Claimant.

With regard to the nature of the rescission, the Respondent explains that the MOC
contained a contractual clause, Clause 24, allowing for unilateral termination in the
event of (i) a delay in the initiation of exploitation; (ii) suspension of any activities for
more than one year; and (iii) and uncured breach of contract for more than one year.
The CVG proceeded by way of an administrative resolution through which the contract
was rescinded alleging breach by the Claimant under such clause. Because Clause 24
is expressly cited in the last recital of the Resolution, Venezuela submits that it is this
contractual right which is the basis for the CVG’s decision.>°?

Similarly as in the Hipermercado Amigo case decided by the Venezuelan Tribunal
Supremo,>© the rescission is thus an act of contract performance whose legality may
only be analyzed with regard to the contract, since the Administration acted as one of
the contractual parties, utilizing a mechanism set forth therein to terminate the

contractual relationship.*°! For Venezuela, the fact that the Administration used a
“resolution” does not mean that it was exercising exorbitant powers.° Venezuela
contends that, when provided for in the contract itself, the right to unilaterally rescind
the contract is, unquestionably, a contractual right and may not be considered an
“exorbitant power”, since this term refers to something that is not included in the
contract.°°

For the Respondent, the words “opportunity and convenience” were not used as the
legal grounds for the decision. The true legal grounds are specifically and expressly
described at the end of the same paragraph rescinding the MOC, where it is explained
that the decision to rescind the contract was made “due to the cessation of activities for
more than one (1) year, in accordance with Clause Twenty-four of the aforementioned

contract” 54

According to Venezuela, by February 201 1—more than eight years after the MOC was
signed—the CVG was faced with a stalled project and a still undeveloped Las Cristinas
mine, as well as a deteriorating environmental situation at the mine site The
Respondent posits that this situation directly contravened not only the objectives of the
MOC, but also the Administrative Agreement between the CVG and the Ministry of
Mines (which required exploitation to begin within 2 years of its signing) and the
Mining Law (which provides that exploitation must commence within seven years and
that activities may not be suspended for a period greater than one year).>°

For the Respondent, Clause 9.4 of the MOC, which tolls certain time periods until
Crystallex has obtained all necessary permits, refers solely to the time limits
independently agreed upon by the Parties in the MOC, and not to the timeframe
originally established in the Mining Law. Thus, the clause by its own terms is
inapplicable to other relevant time limits related to exploitation which are otherwise
established by law.>*

Furthermore, any contractual conditions which have the purpose or effect of evading
the required time limits under the Mining Law (which concern the public order) are null
and void and may not be invoked.**

In addition, Venezuela notes that the rescission was not based on false assumptions,
because the activities related to the project were in fact suspended.* Furthermore, a
unilateral rescission for breach of contract does not require a prior administrative
procedure or prior notification.*”? Venezuela explains that Venezuelan jurisprudence
has established that, when terminating an authorization for the exploitation of mineral
resources due to an operator’s failure to meet its obligations, the Administration is not
obliged to lodge an administrative procedure.*’! Moreover, there was no “diversion of
power” or disproportionate conduct in the exercise by the CVG of its contractual
authority to rescind.°” Finally, the resolution did not violate the Venezuelan law
principle of “confianza legitima” (legitimate expectation), because any reassurances
prior to the rescission that the MOC was in full force could not lead to expectations that
the MOC would not be rescinded in the future in accordance with its terms, including
as a result of a continued contractual breach or suspension of activities.>”>

b. Due process mechanisms were available

Venezuela’s position is that, in cases where a rescission is an act of contract
performance, it is not necessary to provide a prior administrative procedure, since any
party that considers that its right have been violated may, after the alleged violation,
bring the case before a court to enforce such rights (as was provided for in the MOC).>

Furthermore, in the letter in which CVG President Khan communicated the rescission
to Crystallex, he specifically reminded the Claimant of its right to exercise a
reconsideration appeal, which the Claimant failed to do.*”°

At this time, the Claimant contends, China became one of Venezuela’s most important
partners, and one of its largest creditors.°””

According to the Claimant, after having considered, but later rejected, a possible
collaboration with a Russian partner (Rusoro/VenRus), Venezuela now turned to China.
As part of a package of bilateral agreements between Venezuela and China and a
number of contracts with Chinese state-owned companies,*”*® on 27 February 2012
Venezuela entered into a framework agreement with CITIC, a Chinese construction
company, to jointly develop the gold mine at Las Cristinas (“CITIC Framework
Agreement”).>””

The Framework Agreement provides that MINERA, the Venezuelan state-company,
would provide CITIC all documents relating to the Project that it holds, including all
the studies, reserve and resource data and engineering work completed by Crystallex
and its consultants.**° The Claimant takes this reference as a confirmation that its
studies were fully sufficient and adequate.**!

The Claimant further points to Article 6 of the CITIC Framework Agreement, which
characterizes the decision which is at issue in this arbitration as “sovereign”:

“The Parties understand that an arbitral proceeding is in existence for a
sovereign decision taken by the Venezuelan government in conformity with
its laws, in relation to the Las Cristinas mine”.

Article 6 goes on to state that this arbitration involves the recovery by the Venezuelan
state of its rights over Las Cristinas, which the Claimant takes as a further confirmation
that this arbitration cannot be considered as a breach of contract dispute between the
CVG and Crystallex.**

2. The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s allegation that Venezuela has partnered
with other Parties to develop Las Cristinas following the rescission of the MOC is
contradicted by the content of both the CITIC Framework Agreement and the CITIC
Studies Agreement. The Respondent submits that neither the CITIC Framework
Agreement nor the CITIC Studies Agreement, entered into in 2012, grant any mining

contemplating any mining rights.**°

JURISDICTION

OVERVIEW

It is undisputed between the Parties that the Claimant is an “investor” pursuant to
Article I(g)(ii) of the Treaty, which defines “investor” as “any enterprise incorporated
or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of Canada’. Crystallex was
incorporated under the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada,>** and has its
head office in Toronto. Further, Crystallex has asserted that it has made an “investment”
under Article I(f) of the Treaty, which provides a broad definition (“every kind of
asset”), and includes “rights conferred by law or under contract to undertake any
economic and commercial activity including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract
or exploit natural resources” (Article I(f)(vi) of the Treaty). In addition, Crystallex’s
‘Venezuelan branch constitutes, according to the Claimant, a “form of participation in a
company, business enterprise or joint venture” under Article I(f)(ii) of the Treaty. These
arguments pertaining to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae and materiae have
not been disputed by the Respondent.

It is further undisputed that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Ministry of
Environment’s denial of the Permit in April 2008.>*

The Respondent has, however, put forward two objections to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal in relation to the claims concerning the rescission of the MOC.

a. First, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims
regarding the rescission of the MOC because the Claimant has failed to satisfy the
notice and amicable settlement requirements set forth in Article XII(2) of the
Treaty. Venezuela argues that the rescission of the MOC and any related claims
were not subject to the Notice of Dispute sent by Crystallex on 24 November 2008
to the Ministry of Mines, and that, even if they were, a six-month amicable
settlement period was not followed subsequent to the rescission of the MOC.

b. Second, the Respondent contends that Crystallex’s claims related to the rescission
of the MOC are contract claims, and in the absence of an umbrella clause in the
Treaty, such claims cannot be heard by an international arbitral tribunal. Venezuela
further argues that Clause 19 of the MOC provides an exclusive forum selection
clause, and that the Claimant’s claim relating to the termination of the MOC must
thus be heard pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism set out in that clause,

588 See Certificate of Continuance and By-Law No. 1 of Crystallex International Corporation, undated, Exh. C-71.

58° See Venezuela’s Opening Presentation (Goodman), Tr. [Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 1, 264: 10-14: “We don’t
have a jurisdictional objection to events based on what may or may not happen in April 2008. I hope that’s the
clearest. Our objection is to February 2011, for the reasons we set forth in our pleadings”.

106

429.

431.

which in the Respondent’s view excludes the jurisdiction of an investment treaty
tribunal.

The Claimant, in turn, contends that:

a. Crystallex has complied with the notice and amicable settlement requirements,
because the Notice of Dispute of 24 November 2008 covered not only the denial of
the Permit, but also the announcement of the take-over of Las Cristinas, which was
ultimately enforced through the rescission of the MOC. Furthermore, the Notice of
Dispute was sent in the context of an ongoing and growing dispute, and the
rescission of the MOC should be considered as an aggravation of the existing
dispute regarding the denial of the Permit, not as a wholly separate and distinct
dispute requiring a new notice and amicable settlement period.

b. Crystallex’s claims are not contractual in nature, but are all based on the Treaty,
and they originate from sovereign acts taken by Venezuela. As a result of the
analytical distinction between contract and treaty claims, an exclusive forum
selection clause such as Clause 19 of the MOC cannot deprive an investment treaty
tribunal of its jurisdiction over treaty claims.

FIRST OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION: NO NOTICE OF DISPUTE AND AMICABLE
SETTLEMENT IN RELATION TO THE MOC CLAIMS.

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that Crystallex failed to comply with the Treaty’s
jurisdictional requirements for claims related to the rescission of the MOC, and thus the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over those claims.°””

The Respondent contends that Article XII of the BIT required Crystallex to (i) provide
written notice identifying the measure that it alleges as a breach of the Treaty that
caused the investor loss or damage, and (ii) allow six months for good faith negotiations
after the notice to settle the dispute amicably.**! Venezuela submits that the Notice that
Crystallex delivered to the Ministry of Mines on 24 November 2008 (the “Notice of
Dispute”)*”? addressed only the issue of the denial of the Permit and, as it pre-dates the
rescission of the MOC by more than two years, it necessarily cannot be considered as
covering the claims relating to the latter. Thus, by failing to respect Article XII of the

Treaty with regard to the claims concerning the termination of the MOC, the Claimant
did not perfect Venezuela’s necessary consent for jurisdiction.**

According to Venezuela, Crystallex asserts two separate disputes: the first dispute
relates to alleged measures taken by the Ministry of Environment which, according to
Crystallex’s Notice of Dispute, “culminat[ed]” in the 14 April 2008 denial of
Crystallex’s application for a Permit to mine Las Cristinas. The language of the Notice
of Dispute thus expressly stipulates a temporal limit of the alleged conduct and
measures that are in dispute, i.e. the Ministry of Environment’s conduct “culminating”
in the denial of the Permit in April 2008.*” The second dispute relates to the rescission
of the MOC*® and Crystallex was accordingly obliged to provide notice of this dispute
as well.°°°

According to the Respondent, Crystallex did not provide adequate notice of a dispute
over the rescission of the MOC because (i) Crystallex’s Notice of Dispute predated the
termination of the MOC by more than two years and thus could not have served as a
notice of a dispute concerning that measure;>”” and (ii) a general notice that there may
be a dispute is insufficient given the text of the BIT which refers to “notice ... that a
measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in breach of this
Agreement”, i.e. the state must be notified that a particular measure is an alleged breach
that caused the Claimant harm.>”® In that sense, references to hearsay comments
reported in the press cannot, in the Respondent’s view, constitute notice of a dispute
covering measures that have not yet taken place.>”?

Moreover, the rescission of the MOC cannot be seen as a continuation and aggravation
of the dispute relating to the denial of the Permit.’ According to the Respondent, the
two disputes are clearly separate, as they “involve different legal questions, different
Government actors, and different alleged harm’.®! Even Crystallex treated each
measure separately by alleging, after the denial of the Permit, that it was seeking
repeated assurances from the CVG that the MOC was still in force and that it continued
to perform under the MOC.°°?

435. In addition, the Respondent relies on arbitral decisions that emphasize the importance
of precisely articulating the dispute at issue for there to be a finding of state consent to
arbitrate. It also argues that compliance with conditions set out in the dispute
settlement provisions of a treaty is a jurisdictional requirement, and thus non-
compliance with such treaty conditions results in lack of jurisdiction.°*

436. Furthermore, even assuming that a dispute was properly filed with respect to the
aforementioned contractual claim, the Respondent submits that the Claimant ignored
the Article XII(2) six-month cooling-off period to try to reach an amicable settlement
before resorting to arbitration. Following the rescission of the MOC, Crystallex did not
seek to communicate with the CVG or Venezuela to pursue amicable settlement talks
regarding the rescission. Instead, on 16 February 2011 (just 13 days after the rescission)
Crystallex filed its Request for Arbitration.

437.  Inconclusion, because Crystallex failed to comply with the jurisdictional requirements
set out in the Treaty in respect of claims regarding the rescission of the MOC, the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over those claims.

2. The Claimant’s Position

438. | The Claimant contends that the Notice of Dispute it gave to Venezuela fulfilled all the
requirements under the Treaty.©°

439. | The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s argument that the Notice of Dispute covered
the Permit denial but not the expropriation of the MOC and any related Treaty claims.”
In this respect, the Claimant argues that the language of the Notice of Dispute explicitly
covered the former and the latter as it stated that a “dispute has arisen in connection
with conduct and measures culminating in the decision of the Ministry of Environment
and Natural Resources not to grant the [Permit] ... and the subsequent announcement

also mentioned, inter alia, “the Government's decision to take over the operation of Las
Cristinas Ley. Thus, according to the Claimant, the Notice of Dispute covered the
Permit denial as well as the take-over of Las Cristinas which was ultimately enforced
through the rescission of the MOC.°!°

The Claimant additionally alleges that the Notice of Dispute described Crystallex’s
discriminatory treatment and measures that “ha[d] caused Crystallex to suffer
significant economic loss and damage”.°'! It went on to provide that the Respondent’s
actions “constitute a unilateral and fundamental violation of the legal framework
applicable to Crystallex’s investment in Las Cristinas project as well as a breach of
Venezuela’s obligations under ... international law and the substantive protections of
the Treaty”.°!? The Notice of Dispute stated that the Claimant would seek arbitration
pursuant to the terms of the Treaty if the dispute was not settled.°!? In short, the
Claimant claims that the Notice of Dispute fulfilled all of the requirements of the
Treaty.

The Claimant further argues that investment treaty tribunals have applied two “rules of
reason” when interpreting investment treaties’ notice and amicable settlement
provisions.°!*

First, when an initial dispute is notified and amicable settlement talks are pursued, an
evolution or exacerbation of that same or a related dispute requires no separate
notification.°'> Citing to Teinver v. Argentina, the Claimant contends that the dispute
regarding the rescission of the MOC was “closely related to” and “follow[ed]” the
Permit denial and thus no separate notice was required for claims relating to the
rescission.°!® Moreover, the rescission of the MOC should be considered as an
aggravation of the existing dispute regarding the Permit denial and not as a wholly
separate dispute requiring a new notice and amicable settlement period.*'” To hold
otherwise would lead to the unreasonable result that Crystallex would be required under

the BIT to have two separate arbitrations — one for the Permit denial and the other for
the rescission of the MOC — when the underlying dispute is one and the same.°!®

Further, the two cases on which the Respondent heavily relies (Burlington Resources
v. Ecuador and Murphy Exploration v. Ecuador) are distinguishable and are in the
minority view on this legal issue.°!? The notice and amicable settlement provisions of
the Treaty are a “best efforts” obligation that Crystallex clearly fulfilled through its
notice of dispute and subsequent negotiations.©”

The second “rule of reason” that, in the Claimant’s view, investment tribunals have
applied to notice and amicable settlement provisions is that there is no requirement for
investors to engage in futile settlement discussions with a respondent state.‘?! For the
Claimant, it would be manifestly unreasonable to interpret the Treaty as requiring
Crystallex to renegotiate this issue specifically where Venezuela had already refused,
for more than two years, to settle the dispute related to the Permit denial.°?

3. Analysis

445. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by Article XII of the BIT, titled “Settlement of
Disputes between an Investor and the Host Contracting Party”, which reads as follows
in relevant parts:

“1, Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or
not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and
that the investor or an enterprise owned or controlled directly or indirectly
by the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of,
that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.

2. If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months
from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor
to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). For the purposes of this
paragraph, a dispute is considered to be initiated when the investor of one
Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the other Contracting
Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting
Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor or an enterprise
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach. [...]”°*

446. Article XII sets out a multi-layered and sequential dispute resolution system which
provides that:

i. First, an investor must deliver a written notice of dispute to the disputing state
Party. The date of the delivery of the written notice determines in turn the date
when a “dispute” is considered initiated for the purposes of Article XII(2) of
the BIT;

ii. Second, the Parties must attempt to settle the dispute amicably for a period of
six months from the date on which it was initiated; and

iii. Third, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within such six-month
“cooling-off” period, the investor may submit it to arbitration in accordance
with Article XII(4).

447, A “dispute” under Article XII(1)-(2) of the BIT is, according to the oft-quoted
definition given by the Permanent Court of International Justice (“PCI”), a
“disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between

two persons”.4 There is no controversy between the Parties that a “dispute”, in the
sense of the Mavrommaitis definition, arose after the denial of the Permit in 2008. There
is equally no controversy that, in view of the 2008 Notice of Dispute which Crystallex
sent to the Ministry of Mines (with a copy to the Minister of the Environment and the
Attorney-General of Venezuela),°* the dispute arising out of the Permit denial was
properly notified. It is also beyond disagreement that thereafter the six-month cooling-
off period was complied with and that no fruitful amicable settlement was achieved by
the Parties during those six months.

The disagreement between the Parties revolves around whether a new notice of dispute
should have been delivered and a new amicable settlement period should have been
pursued in relation to the subsequent events concerning the rescission of the MOC,
which the Claimant has brought before this Tribunal along with those relating to the
Permit denial.

In the Tribunal’s view, the question is whether, pursuant to Article XII(1)-(2) of the
BIT, the rescission of the MOC relates to the “dispute” over which the Claimant gave
its Notice of Dispute in November 2008 and over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction.
Put differently, is the Tribunal faced with two different disputes, which would require
a new notice of dispute and new amicable settlement, or with the evolution of the same
dispute?

The Tribunal considers that the relevant inquiry in these circumstances is whether the
disagreements at issue in the two settings relate to the same “subject-matter”. The
Tribunal finds support for this approach in several decisions of international tribunals.
The Tribunal is mindful that some of these decisions were rendered in non-identical
legal frameworks and presented non-identical factual constellations. However, despite
these differences, the Tribunal finds those decisions instructive for their underlying
principles.

In CMS v. Argentina, the tribunal rejected an objection from the respondent that the
claimant had submitted to the ICSID tribunal two different disputes and that the second
dispute “was not registered in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention
and the six-month period required by Article VII(3) of the Treaty between the dates a
dispute arose and that of its submission for arbitration has not elapsed”.°* The tribunal
held that “as long as [multiple different actions] [allegedly] affect the investor in
violation of its rights and cover the same subject matter, the fact that they may originate
from different sources or emerge at different times does not necessarily mean that the

disputes are separate and distinct”.®”’ In light of this finding, the tribunal concluded that
“such claims do not require either a new request for arbitration or a new six-month
period for consultation or negotiation, before the submission of the dispute to
arbitration under the Treaty”.

In Teinver v. Argentina, the ICSID tribunal was faced with a similar objection. The
issue there was whether the “two disagreements [between the parties were] sufficiently
related that negotiations under the first disagreement are enough to satisfy [the 6-month
cooling-off requirement]” in the applicable BIT. The tribunal held that “[i]nternational
jurisprudence suggests that the subject matter of the negotiations should be the same as
the dispute that is brought before the court or tribunal”.®? The tribunal’s conclusion
was that the two “core issues” in the two sets of disagreements were “related to the
point that they share[d] the same subject-matter”.°*°

The ICSID tribunal in Swisslion v. Macedonia similarly concluded that the new facts
of which the claimant complained in its Memorial “enter within the subject matter of
the original claim and are admissible as such and may be presented without requiring

further consultations between the Parties” .'

There can be no doubt, in the Tribunal’s eyes, that the two main areas of disagreements
at issue in this arbitration (i.e., one relating to the Permit denial and the other relating
to the MOC rescission) relate to the same dispute having the same subject-matter. Both
disagreements concern the Parties’ conflicting legal views and interests in relation to
Crystallex’s claim to mine Las Cristinas and the underlying facts bear upon the effects
of the MOC. Under that framework, the Claimant enjoyed certain rights in relation to
Las Cristinas and was pursuing, in cooperation or confrontation with the CVG and
Venezuelan authorities (depending on the moments), the objective of commencing the
exploitation of the Las Cristinas mine. The fact that different Venezuelan authorities
may have played a greater role in one or the other circumstance does not change the
Tribunal’s conclusion that the two disagreements shared the same subject-matter. In
other words, at the time when the MOC was terminated, the dispute which had arisen
between the Parties in connection with the Permit denial had simply evolved and the
respective positions had not changed but rather become more definite and definitive.
Far from giving rise to a new dispute, the MOC rescission only entailed an enlargement
of the set of facts rather than new facts giving rise to a new dispute. As a result, the

MOC recission is in reality part and parcel of the same dispute which had arisen with
the Permit denial earlier on.

This being so, the Claimant properly delivered its Notice of Dispute in November 2008
and complied with the 6-month cooling-off period, in accordance with Article XII(1)-
(2) of the BIT. No fruitful negotiations were achieved at that time. As the more recent
MOC rescission related to the dispute which had commenced in April 2008, there was
no need for the Claimant to deliver a new notice of dispute in February 2011 and to
trigger a new six-month amicable settlement period as there was no (new) dispute to
notify.

Furthermore, to adopt the Respondent’s position would allow a state to continue to
adopt new measures with a view to triggering new notices and amicable settlement
requirements. Moreover, to take the Respondent’s argument to its logical consequences
would mean that the Claimant should have commenced one arbitration for the Permit
denial and one for the MOC rescission, which would raise supplemental procedural
issues (e.g., consolidation, relationship between the two proceedings if not
consolidated, etc.). Such a result cannot be what the notice and amicable settlement
requirements in the Treaty reasonably entail.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant complied with the
BIT’s jurisdictional requirements concerning the notice of dispute and amicable
settlement efforts set out in Article XII(1)-(2) of the BIT.

As a result of this conclusion, the Tribunal can dispense with entering into the
Claimant’s alternative argument that in the circumstances concerning the MOC
rescission new amicable settlement attempts would have been futile.

SECOND OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION: NO JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO
CONTRACT CLAIMS

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s allegations regarding the rescission of the
MOC are contractual claims that are not covered by the Treaty®* and that the Claimant
is “trying to elevate an alleged contractual breach by the CVG into a treaty claim”.
The Respondent underscores that the Treaty does not contain an umbrella clause to

bring contract claims within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.** In addition, Article XII of

the Treaty provides that only disputes arising from “a breach of this Agreement” may
be heard by arbitral tribunals established under the Treaty.°>

According to Venezuela, the Claimant tries to label its claims regarding the rescission
of the MOC as treaty claims, but its factual allegations show that the claims “are
fundamentally based on the provisions and obligations found in the contract”.©*° The
Respondent refers in this respect to the Claimant’s pleadings that specifically mention
alleged breaches by the CVG of obligations under the MOC.”

In addition, the Respondent submits that such allegations of non-compliance with the
MOC “cannot be transformed into an investment dispute subject to the BIT because the
CVG [in rescinding the MOC] was acting as a contracting partner, and not pursuant to
its delegated sovereign authority as an instrumentality of Venezuela”.©* In other words,
the Claimant has not shown that there has been an act of “puissance publique” on the
part of the CVG when rescinding the MOC. In this respect, the Respondent disputes the
Claimant’s reading of Clause 6 of the CITIC Framework Agreement (which refers to
Venezuela’s “sovereign decision” and the recovery of “its” rights over Las Cristinas).
For the Respondent, the purpose of that clause is simply “to exempt CITIC of any
potential liability derived from Crystallex’s arbitration claims related to Las

Cristinas”.°?

Furthermore, according to the Respondent, Clause 19 of the MOC is an exclusive forum
selection clause in favor of the Venezuelan courts for all controversies relating to this
contract, which deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the Claimant’s contract
claims.°°

The Respondent asserts that the clause is a mandatory dispute resolution obligation for
disputes of any nature arising from the execution of the contract, and the clause itself
even provides that such disputes “may not give rise to claims before foreign tribunals”,
thereby constituting an effective waiver of the right to arbitrate claims related to the
rescission of the MOC before an investment treaty tribunal.®! For Venezuela, “foreign”
in the context of Clause 19 also includes international tribunals set up under
international law.”

Relying on the statement by the tribunal in SGS v. Philippines to the effect that a
contract can waive treaty jurisdiction if ‘expressly provided’ and that “the Tribunal
should not exercise its jurisdiction over a contractual claim when the parties have
already agreed on how such a claim is to be resolved, and have done so exclusively”,
the Respondent submits that this is precisely the case with respect to Clause 19 of the
moc.

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that all of its claims are based on the Treaty and that
“Venezuela cannot seek to avoid its obligations under the Treaty by labeling this dispute
as contractual”.

According to the Claimant, Crystallex’s contract constitutes an investment under the
plain language of Article I(f)(vi) of the Treaty as the term “investment” under this
provision covers “rights conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic
and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit
natural resources".©° Furthermore, under Article TI(2) and Article VII of the Treaty, the
contract must be provided “fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security”
and cannot be nationalized or expropriated unless certain requirements are met.”

The Claimant contends that simply because a treaty claim involves a contract (as do the
vast majority of treaty claims) does not mean that the analytical distinction between
claims based on these separate instruments fails to exist.“® Crystallex’s claim is that
Venezuela, through a series of sovereign acts, including the Permit denial and the
repudiation of the MOC through an administrative resolution, expropriated and
mistreated Crystallex’s investments in breach of the Treaty.°?

To this effect, the Claimant refers, inter alia, to Clause 6 of the CITIC Framework
Agreement which states that there was a “sovereign decision taken by the Venezuelan
government in conformity with its laws in relation to the Las Cristinas mine” and that
the present arbitration involves the recovery by Venezuela of “its” rights over Las
Cristinas and that Venezuela has thus admitted that this arbitration is not a breach of

contract dispute between the CVG and Crystallex.°° The Claimant also relies on the
MINCA decision of the Political-Administrative Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme
Court of December 2011 for the conclusion that the rescission is a sovereign act.°!
That case concerned the CVG’s termination of the Las Cristinas mine operating
contract of Crystallex’s predecessor, MINCA. The Supreme Court in that case
concluded that the CVG’s unilateral termination of that contract on the basis of an
express contractual provision recognizing the right of unilateral termination in case of
breach constituted an act of ius imperium and the exercise of exorbitant powers (i.e., a
sovereign act).°?

469. The Claimant further contends that investment treaty tribunals have held that an
exclusive forum selection clause in a contract cannot deprive a tribunal of its
jurisdiction over treaty claims. Thus, relying on the test set out by the Annulment
Committee in Vivendi I, the Claimant submits that Clause 19 of the MOC cannot divest
the Tribunal from jurisdiction in this case.*

470. Finally, the Claimant disputes the Respondent's argument that Crystallex waived
arbitral jurisdiction over the rescission of the MOC as a result of Clause 19 of the
MOC.** According to the Claimant, the plain language of this clause (“uncertainties
and controversies of any nature that could arise from the execution of this Contract ...
may not give origin to reclamations before foreign tribunals”) does not expressly waive
claims arising from the Treaty or international law, especially where the claim relates
to the destruction of Crystallex’s investment and not the “execution” of the MOC.°°
Furthermore, this alleged waiver is not the “unambiguous and knowing waiver that
would be required for a claimant to forego its rights under a bilateral investment treaty,
if such a waiver could be made at all".°°’ Clause 19 does neither refer to the Canada-
Venezuela BIT, nor to jurisdiction under the ICSID Additional Facility.%*

3. Analysis

At the outset, the Tribunal recalls that its jurisdiction is founded upon Article XII of the
BIT. Under this provision, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over “[a]ny dispute between
one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim
by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement’.©”° It is clear from the wording of the dispute settlement
clause that the sphere of disputes that can be referred to international arbitration under
the BIT is limited to disputes relating to alleged breaches of the BIT. This subject matter
limitation of the Tribunal’s ratione materiae jurisdiction is undisputed between the
Parties, and rightly so.°°

The Parties are, however, in dispute as to whether the Claimant is attempting to bring
contract, rather than treaty, claims in relation to the rescission of the MOC.

The Tribunal starts with an observation of a general nature, noting that many investment
disputes brought under a bilateral or multilateral investment treaty may involve a set of
facts for which there may be a contractual relationship in place between the Parties. As
noted by Prof. Zachary Douglas,

“A great number of important foreign investments are memorialised in
agreements with the host state or its emanations and thus it is hardly
surprising that a great number of investment disputes are intertwined with a

contractual relationship of this nature”.°°!

The fact that a contract may exist between the Parties and that issues relating to its
performance or termination may play a role in the Parties’ pleadings, does not per se
entail that the Tribunal is faced with contract claims rather than treaty claims. As is

well-established in investment treaty jurisprudence, treaty and contract claims are
distinct issues. In this respect, the Vivendi J annulment committee explained:

“QS. As to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the
present case, it must be stressed that Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate
directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set an independent
standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice
versa, and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT. The point is

made clear in Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which is entitled
“Characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful”:

The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful
is governed by international law. Such characterization is not
affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal
law.

96. In accordance with this general principle (which is undoubtedly
declaratory of general international law), whether there has been a breach of
the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different
questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own
proper or applicable law—in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the
case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract [...]”.°°

To determine whether, as a matter of jurisdiction, the Claimant is bringing contract or
treaty claims, the Tribunal must consider, to use the words of the Vivendi I annulment
committee, the “fundamental basis of the [Claimant’s] claim’. The Tribunal’s
starting point will be the Claimant’s prayers for relief and the formulation of its claims,
as it is for a claimant to file its claim and thus define the nature of the claim that it
submits before a tribunal. However, it would of course not be sufficient for a claimant
to simply label contract breaches as treaty breaches to avoid the jurisdictional hurdles
present in a BIT. The Tribunal’s jurisdictional inquiry is a matter of objective
determination, and the Tribunal would in case of pure “labeling” be at liberty and have
the duty to re-characterize the alleged breaches.

In this case, however, the Tribunal is unable to find any indication in the record which
would suggest that the Claimant has disguised contract claims as treaty claims. To the
contrary, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has established that its claims in
relation to the MOC are fundamentally based on the Treaty and thus fall within the
ratione materiae jurisdictional parameters defined by Article XII of the BIT. For
example, with respect to expropriation, the Claimant has alleged that the unjustified
termination of a contract based on sovereign prerogative is expropriatory and that the
alleged “destruction” of the Claimant’s contractual rights contained in the MOC
amounts to an expropriation.™ Similarly, the Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment
claims are predicated upon Venezuela’s alleged repudiation of the MOC, which in the
Claimant’s eyes constitutes unfair and inequitable conduct, a violation of its legitimate
expectations, as well as an act which is arbitrary and contrary to transparency and

consistency. It is clear to the Tribunal that the Claimant does not allege contractual
violations on the part of Venezuela and does not—nor could it—request the Tribunal
to pass judgment on whether there were any contractual breaches in relation to the
MOC. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s complaints that “[w]hen terminating
the MOC, the CVG failed to comply with the very terms of the agreement itself” or that
the rescission “was plainly illegitimate”, which the Respondent takes as indications that
the Claimant’s pleadings are fundamentally based on the contract, are sentences
taken out of their context (which is one relating to Treaty claims). They thus do not
change in any way the Tribunal’s conclusion.

Whether the Claimant’s claims are well-founded in law and whether the facts
underlying those claims may implicate the Respondent’s liability under the BIT’s
substantive standards are questions which will not be addressed here, but to which the
Tribunal will revert when discussing the merits.

Closely related to the issue of the distinction between treaty and contract claims is the
question of the effect of Clause 19 of the MOC on the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.
Clause 19 of the MOC reads as follows:

“The uncertainties and controversies of any nature that might arise from the
execution of this Contract and that may not be resolved in an amicable
manner by the Parties shall be resolved by the competent tribunals of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in accordance with its laws, and they may
not give rise to claims before foreign tribunals.”

In this respect, the Tribunal wishes to recall a further and oft-quoted passage from the
Vivendi I annulment committee decision:

“98. In a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an
international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to
any valid choice of forum clause in the contract. [...]

101. On the other hand, where “the fundamental basis of the claim” is a treaty
laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is
to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract
between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions
cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard. At most, it

might be relevant—as municipal law will often be relevant—in assessing
whether there has been a breach of the treaty [...]”.°%

As already clarified, the Claimant is not bringing before this Tribunal any claims
relating to the “execution” or performance (“ejecucién”) of the MOC, but claims
concerning alleged breaches of the international obligations assumed by the
Respondent through an international treaty. As explained in Vivendi I, the same set of
facts can give rise to different claims grounded on differing legal orders, i.e. the
municipal and the international legal orders. However, an exclusive jurisdiction
clause in relation to disputes concerning possible contractual breaches, such as Clause
19 of the MOC, may not divest an international tribunal of its jurisdiction under an
international treaty in relation to possible treaty breaches. Differently put, an ICSID
(Additional Facility) Tribunal has a duty to carry out its remit under the BIT, namely
to decide upon treaty claims under international law, irrespective of a domestic law
jurisdictional clause relating to the resolution of different types of disputes.

 

Finally, the Tribunal addresses the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant waived
“the right to arbitrate claims related to the termination of the MOC under an
international investment treaty” by way of Clause 19 of the MOC.°” The Tribunal
considers that, even if it were minded to find that an investor may waive by contract
rights contained in a treaty, any such waiver would have to be formulated in clear and
specific terms: a waiver, if and when admissible at all, is never to be lightly admitted
as it requires knowledge and intent of forgoing a right, a conduct rather unusual in
economic transactions. As held by the tribunal in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia:

68 Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentina Republic, ICSID Case No.
ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, Exh. CLA-96, paras 98-101 (internal footnotes omitted). The
annulment committee went on to say that:

 

“102. [...] it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in
respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the
claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court.
In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one
governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law.
Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of
municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.

 

103. Moreover the Committee does not understand how, if there had been a breach
of the BIT in the present case (a question of international law), the existence of
Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract could have prevented its character
as such. A state cannot rely on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid
the characteri

  

   

 

 

  

tion of its conduct as internationally unlawful under a treaty”.

“[A]Jn ICSID tribunal has a duty to exercise its jurisdiction in such instances
[where a conflicting forum selection clause exists] absent any indication that
the parties specifically intended that the conflicting clause act as a waiver or
modification of an otherwise existing grant of jurisdiction to ICSID. A
separate conflicting document should be held to affect the jurisdiction of an
ICSID tribunal only if it clearly is intended to modify the jurisdiction
otherwise granted to ICSID. As stated above, an explicit waiver by an
investor of its rights to invoke the jurisdiction of ICSID pursuant to a BIT
could affect the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal. However, the Tribunal will
not imply a waiver or modification of ICSID jurisdiction without specific

indications of the common intention of the Parties” °"'

482. In this case, there is no evidence whatsoever that the Parties specifically intended—
through Clause 19 of the MOC—to limit the application of the BIT or the procedural
rights granted under such Treaty. As already explained, Clause 19 is an exclusive
jurisdiction clause which by its own terms is circumscribed to disputes “arising from
the execution (‘ejecucién’) of the MOC”. That clause makes no mention of the
Claimant’s rights under the BIT, and no reference to the BIT in general terms or to the
Claimant’s right to seek recourse in arbitration for the alleged violation of those rights.
Furthermore, the Tribunal neither views the reference in Clause 19 to “foreign
tribunals” to be capable of depriving an international tribunal constituted under an
international treaty of its jurisdiction over alleged treaty breaches nor does it see any
indices that the Parties did in fact contemplate such a set of circumstances.

483. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s second jurisdictional
objection.

484. In conclusion, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all of the Treaty claims submitted to it
and the MOC rescission is part and parcel of a set of facts validly put into the record.

As to liability, the Claimant has advanced the following arguments:

LIABILITY

OVERVIEW

-672

Venezuela has breached Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing to afford Crystallex’s
investment fair and equitable treatment. Crystallex had legitimate expectations that
it would operate Las Cristinas over the life of the MOC. Venezuela eviscerated
those legitimate expectations by denying Crystallex the Permit and terminating the
MOC without cause, and for purely political reasons. Further, Venezuela’s actions
were negligent, arbitrary, and lacking due process, transparency and consistency.

Venezuela has breached Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing to afford Crystallex’s
investment full protection and security, which for the Claimant includes legal
security. Venezuela’s actions destroyed the legal security surrounding Crystallex’s
investment. In particular, Venezuela committed acts of administrative negligence
and made a number of statements of “harassment” and discriminatory nature which
were, according to the Claimant, not in accord with the full protection and security
standard under the Treaty.

Venezuela has breached Article VII(1) of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating
the Claimant’s investment in Venezuela. Because the MOC granted Crystallex the
right to develop and exploit the Las Cristinas mine, the MOC (with its ensuing
rights) constitutes an investment protected by the Treaty. Crystallex claims that
Venezuela indirectly expropriated its investment through a series of cumulative and
interconnected measures that began with the denial of the Permit by the Ministry
of the Environment, continued with delays in the administrative remedies regarding
that denial, repeated assurances by officials that the conditions for the Permit had
been fulfilled, as well as nationalization threats by other government officials, and
finally ended with the CVG’s rescission of the MOC. The Claimant further
contends that the rescission of the MOC itself also constituted a direct expropriation
because it extinguished Crystallex’s rights that allowed it to develop Las Cristinas
and ordered the transfer of all assets to the CVG.

The Respondent has advanced the following arguments on liability:

B.

488.

a. Venezuela has not breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in the Treaty,
which is the “minimum standard of treatment” under customary international law.
Crystallex could not have any reasonable or legitimate expectations regarding the
Las Cristinas project, because Venezuela never made a specific promise or
commitment to provide the Permit or, in the case of the CVG, to not exercise its
contractual right to rescission. In any event, the Permit was properly denied and the
MOC was properly rescinded. Further, Venezuela did not engage in any arbitrary,
negligent, non-transparent, inconsistent or abusive conduct.

b. Venezuela has not breached the full protection and security standard. Full
protection and security does not extend to “legal security”. In any event, legal
protection in Venezuela did exist, but it was Crystallex who chose not to avail itself
of it. Furthermore, Venezuelan officials have not engaged in any statements that
can be considered acts of harassment.

c. There was no expropriation (either direct or indirect) of Crystallex’s investment,
because Venezuela’s acts are the legitimate application of reasonable
environmental regulations, and a contracting party’s legitimate exercise of its right
to rescind the MOC under mutually agreed upon terms. According to Venezuela,
the Permit was lawfully denied because Crystallex failed to meet the environmental
requirements established by law and enforced by the Ministry of Environment, and
the CVG’s rescission of the MOC was a legitimate response to Crystallex’s failure
to meet its contractual obligations.

FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
1. The Parties’ Positions
a. Overview

The Claimant contends that Venezuela violated its obligation to afford Crystallex’s
investment fair and equitable treatment. Crystallex had legitimate expectations that it
would operate the Las Cristinas project over the life of the MOC. These expectations
were backed by contract and a clear Venezuelan legal framework, and were further
reinforced by multiple approvals from Government agencies, as well as assurances by
Government officials that all the pre-conditions for the Permit had been met and the
Permit was to be handed over. Venezuela eviscerated these legitimate expectations by
denying Crystallex the Permit, and terminating the MOC without cause and for purely
political reasons.

Moreover, the actions of the Venezuelan Government with respect to the Permit were,
according to the Claimant, negligent and arbitrary, their decision-making process
lacked transparency, and the relevant decisions were taken in the absence of due process
of law.

Venezuela contends that the Claimant has failed to establish that Venezuela breached
the fair and equitable treatment standard, either under the minimum standard of
treatment or under an autonomous treaty standard. The Claimant could not have any
legitimate expectations that it would operate the Las Cristinas project, because
Venezuela made no specific promises or commitments. In any event, Venezuela did not
frustrate any of the Claimant’s expectations, because the Permit was properly denied
and the MOC was properly rescinded.

Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to establish that the
measures complained of amount to gross lack of due process, manifest arbitrariness,
complete lack of transparency or bad faith (which is the threshold to be met under the
minimum standard of treatment), or were otherwise contrary to any of the other
autonomous treaty standards identified by the Claimant.

b. The content of the fair and equitable treatment standard
Article II(2) of the Treaty reads:

“Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the principles of
international law, accord investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full protection and
security”.

The Claimant submits that “fair and equitable treatment” in Art. II(2) of the Treaty is
an autonomous treaty standard, which is intentionally broad, and flexible and meant to
protect investors in a variety of situations in which state conduct may be considered as
unjust.°”> The standard “requires host States, consistent with the object and purpose of
BITs and the good faith principle, to be proactive in the protection of investment and
not to act improperly or discreditably”.°’* The Claimant further relies on arbitral
decisions to argue that bad faith or malicious intent is not required for a finding of
breach of the aforementioned standard.°”>

According to the Claimant, international tribunals have developed specific principles
inherent in the fair and equitable treatment standard which, in so far as they are relevant
to the present dispute, consist of the following state conduct: (a) not to defeat the
investor's legitimate expectations; (b) non-arbitrariness; (c) transparency, consistency,
procedural propriety, and due process; (d) non-discrimination; (e) non-abusive conduct
and good faith.°”° These are the elements of the fair and equitable treatment standard

that are applicable in this arbitration®” and “[a] measure that breaches any of these

elements is not fair and equitable”.

In contradistinction, the Respondent contends that Article II(2)’s requirement to accord
“fair and equitable treatment” is the minimum standard under customary international
law. According to Venezuela, the language of Article II(2) of the Treaty explicitly
qualifies the fair and equitable treatment standard by reference to "principles of
international law”, which incorporates the minimum standard of treatment of aliens and
their property under customary international law.°”? Citing LFH Neer & Pauline Neer
v. Mexico, the Respondent argues that, in order for the Tribunal to find a breach of the
Treaty’s fair and equitable treatment obligation, the Claimant must show that the
Respondent’s conduct amounts “to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty
or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that

every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency”.

The Respondent supports its position by noting that the Treaty’s Article II(2) is based
on NAFTA Article 1105, and NAFTA parties as well as NAFTA tribunals have
indicated that this provision incorporates the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment. According to the Respondent, Canada’s subsequent treaty
practice confirms that the Canada-Venezuela BIT applicable in this case incorporates
the minimum standard of treatment.**! The Respondent cites to Glamis Gold v. United
States, where a NAFTA tribunal stated that “‘to violate the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment codified in Article 1105 of the NAFTA, an act must be
sufficiently egregious and shocking — a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness,
blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest
lack of reasons — so as to fall below international standards and constitute a breach of
Article 1105(1)’”.°?

The Respondent contends that NAFTA tribunals are not alone in adopting this view and
that “there is consensus among arbitral tribunals that the threshold [for a finding of fair
and equitable treatment breach] remains high”.°*? The Respondent argues that, under
the minimum standard of treatment, merely failing to live up to subjective expectations

cannot be sufficient to establish a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under
customary international law.°**

For the Claimant, in turn, equating the Treaty’s language “in accordance with principles
of international law” to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment
is misplaced. Rather, “‘a broad and autonomous reading” of the Treaty clause comports
with both the ordinary meaning of its terms and the object and purpose of the Treaty.
The Claimant notes that each tribunal that has considered the interpretation of the
specific phrase “in accordance with principles of international law” has concluded that
the term “principles” requires a broader interpretation of the FET clause than that
provided by the international minimum standard of treatment.°*°

With regard to a possible parallel with NAFTA, the Claimant argues that Venezuela
ignores a number of distinctions between the text of the Treaty and NAFTA, including
the fact that the title of Article 1105 NAFTA refers to the “Minimum Standard of
Treatment” whereas the title of Article II of the Treaty simply refers to the
“Establishment, Acquisition and Protection of Investment”.°*’ Furthermore, the
Claimant casts doubt on the application of the Neer standard (which was enunciated in
the 1920s) to the present arbitration, and argues that, in any event, customary
international law has evolved over the near century since the Neer decision.***

Finally, the Claimant argues that the Treaty contains a most-favored-nation treatment
provision (Article III) pursuant to which it can import the more favorable treatment
given in the Belarus-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty, which came into force in
August 2008 and which provides that an investor from Belarus shall enjoy fair and
equitable treatment without any restriction.* Such reliance by the Claimant on the
Treaty’s MEN clause is disputed by the Respondent, who argues that the Claimant has
not proved that it satisfied the three preconditions to the application of the MFN clause
in the Treaty, namely, that Venezuela accorded Crystallex’s investment (a) “treatment”
that (b) “in like circumstances” was (c) “less favourable” than the treatment accorded
to investors or investments of Belarus.°

c. Legitimate Expectations
i. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that the fair and equitable treatment standard (as established in
recent arbitral decisions) requires that investors be provided with a stable and
predictable investment environment in accordance with the investor's legitimate and
reasonable expectations.©! According to the Claimant, the concept of legitimate
expectations is also recognized in Venezuelan law under the doctrine known as
confianza legitima.°?

In its post-hearing submission, the Claimant has summarized its allegations on its
legitimate expectations in the following terms.°*

At the time of making its initial investment, the Claimant contends that it had the
following legitimate expectations, based on the applicable Venezuelan legal framework
and the terms of the MOC:

e Venezuela would act with economic rationality, reasonableness and proportionality
toward Crystallex’s investment;

e Crystallex would enjoy an exclusive right to exploit the Las Cristinas mine for an
initial period of twenty years, which could be extended for two ten-year periods, if
Crystallex fulfilled its contractual and regulatory obligations for the issuance of the
Permit;

e The process for the issuance of the environmental Permit would be a technical
process, i.e. it would be granted the Permit if it fulfilled all of the technical
requirements set out in the Venezuelan framework and thus received approval for
such technical requirements.°"*

Further, after the 16 May 2007 letter,

e Crystallex had a legitimate expectation that the Permit would be delivered
promptly.°>

Finally, between July 2008 and the rescission of the MOC and the Government take-
over of Las Cristinas, Crystallex continued to have legitimate expectations that:

505.

506.

507.

The Venezuelan Government would act coherently, transparently and in good faith in
deciding Crystallex’s appeal of the Permit denial;

The Venezuelan Government would evaluate the adjusted proposal that was
submitted to the Ministry of Environment in August 2008;

Crystallex would be permitted to develop Las Cristinas, based on assurances provided
by high-level Venezuelan Government officials; and

The MOC would not be arbitrarily rescinded without the payment of compensation
contrary to the terms of the MOC and Venezuelan law.

In reliance on these expectations, Crystallex made significant investments to ensure that
Las Cristinas would be “shovel ready”.®’ Further, in reliance upon assurances provided
following the issuance of the Permit denial letter that the decision to issue the Permit
had been re-opened and that the Government wished to pursue the development of the
Las Cristinas project with Crystallex, Crystallex continued to fulfill its obligations and
exercise its rights under the MOC.°*

According to the Claimant, despite the fact that Crystallex obtained all relevant
approvals from 2004-2007, and repeatedly obtained assurances and representations that
the Permit was forthcoming, Venezuela frustrated each and every one of its
expectations, by denying the Permit and terminating the MOC.””

ii. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent claims that, for there to be legitimate expectations on the part of an
investor, tribunals have held that the investor must show that specific promises or
commitments were made.”! In this case, the Respondent claims there were “neither
specific commitments nor any undertaking to refrain from regulatory action such as the
proper evaluation of the environmental impact of Claimant’s project”.””? Venezuela
never made a specific promise or commitment to provide the Permit or, in the case of
the CVG, not to exercise its contractual right to resci sion.” In addition, no
Venezuelan official gave an assurance that Crystallex had applied for and received all

Sil.

the necessary Permits to undertake the project, and Venezuelan authorities timely
expressed their concerns about the project’s environmental and social impact.’

First, according to Venezuela, its regulatory framework could not have given rise to
any legitimate expectations, because the Claimant has been unable to show that
Venezuelan procedure was not followed by the Ministry of Environment in evaluating
its application for the Permit.”

Second, no expectations can be derived from the terms of the MOC, which was clear
in setting out that the Claimant could not acquire the contractual right to exploit until
the Permit was obtained.”

Third, the alleged administrative approvals on which the Claimant has relied could not
have given rise to legitimate expectations. While the Feasibility Study was approved
by the CVG and the Ministry of Mines, in the ensuing years, the Claimant kept changing
central aspects of its proposed project. For example, the Claimant proposed including
drastically different output scenarios that went to the very essence of the project, and
did not submit an updated EIS reassessing impacts based on those updates.’
Therefore, Crystallex could not have had any legitimate expectation of receiving a
Permit from the Ministry of Environment based on the approval of an outdated
feasibility study. Similarly, no expectations can be derived from the alleged approval
of the EIS, because such approval never took place, or if it did (which Venezuela
denies), it would have been limited to the EIS’s assessment of preliminary
infrastructure works.’°* Thus, the 16 May 2007 letter could not have created legitimate
expectations that the Ministry would grant the Permit to exploit Las Cristinas.’°
Neither Crystallex’s payment of taxes nor the posting of the Bond in June 2007 can
sustain any expectation of receiving a Permit for exploitation, because these acts were
necessary for the granting of the Permit, but could not automatically cause the Permit
to be issued.7!° Crystallex itself acknowledged to its shareholders, in 2007, that there
could be no assurance as to when or if the Permit would be granted.”!!

Fourth, the Respondent submits that governmental statements upon which the Claimant
relies do not support its position that its legitimate expectations were reassured.”!? For

instance, the Minister of Mines' statement in June 2005 that the Permit was “well on
track” was not tantamount to a reassurance that the Permit would certainly be granted
(and in any event the Ministry of Mines had no control over it).’'> Furthermore, any
statements by Ms. Laura Paredes, then Director of Mining Concessions, indicating that
she did not object to the granting of the Permit, are irrelevant, because it was not within
her authority to examine Crystallex’s compliance with the environmental
requirements.”'* Similarly, it is disingenuous to assert that legitimate expectations could
have arisen from statements made at the National Assembly meeting of 4 October 2007
by Sergio Rodriguez, then Director of Planning and Environmental Regulation and later
Vice-Minister of Planning and Environmental Regulation, because he only “referred in
general to environmental aspects”.”'> Finally, the Claimant has not been able to show
any documentary support that after the Permit denial there was a decision on the part
of the Ministry to reopen the Permit review process. The Respondent’s position on the
20 August 2008 letter from Vice-Minister Merly Garcia is that this letter referred to the
pending hierarchical appeal of the denial of the Permit, and not to a broader review of
the merits of the Permit application. Thus, this letter could not have given rise to
legitimate expectations.’!°

To the extent that there were any legitimate expectations, which the Respondent denies,
the Respondent claims that it did not frustrate any of them. The Permit was properly
denied (because the denial was based on specific grounds previously identified but
never adequately addressed by Crystallex) and the MOC was properly rescinded (the
(contractual) ground for the rescission being the suspension of the operation by
Crystallex for more than one year).”!7

d. Arbitrary conduct

The Claimant submits that one of the classic strands of the fair and equitable treatment
standard is that a state should not act in an arbitrary manner’!* and that a measure is
719

likely to be found arbitrary if it is motivated by inappropriate considerations.

The Claimant argues that the key measures in this case, namely the failure to issue the
Permit and the decision to rescind the MOC and dispossess Crystallex of Las Cristinas,

were taken for purely arbitrary and capricious reasons that had no regulatory or
contractual basis, contrary to Venezuelan law.720

First, the reasons set out in the Permit denial letter have no scientific, technical or
rational basis. While the Permit denial letter claims to be based upon unidentified
“technical inspection reports” and “research carried out by specialists competent in the
matter”, it is in fact based only upon a sole Technical Inspection Report from September
2006 which for the Claimant is a fraudulent document.’?! Therefore, there is no
supporting data or technical analysis of any kind to support the reasons set out in the
Permit denial letter, nor any analysis that would explain the revocation of the decision
made less than a year earlier to approve the EIS and issue the Permit.’

Second, the decision to rescind the MOC was not based upon any legitimate contractual
grounds, as clearly shown by a number of CVG letters.’”?

Third, the Claimant alleges that Venezuela's threats towards Crystallex and its
investment were based on a decision to nationalize the gold sector, something which in
the Claimant's view amounts to “administrative caprice”.’”* According to the Claimant,
the Permit denial was based on a pretext since the true rationale for the denial was the
desire to transfer Crystallex’s rights to another operator.’?>

The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the customary international minimum
standard of treatment requires “manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete
lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons”.””° It claims
that the Claimant has failed to establish that the measures complained of amount to such
manifest arbitrariness. In particular, permits, authorizations and approvals issued by
Venezuela to Crystallex (including the EIS) were on their face limited to their terms
that did not exceed the scope of the commitments contained therein. The denial of the
Permit thus could not have constituted a reversal of the approvals of the EIS. Similarly,
there was nothing “manifestly arbitrary and capricious” in Venezuela’s decision to deny
the Permit since the Government based its decision on a rational analysis of Crystallex’s
project.’?”

Transparency, consistency, procedural propriety, due process, and non-
discrimination

The Claimant has further discussed transparency, consistency, procedural propriety,
due process, and non-discrimination as concrete factors that shape the standard of fair
and equitable treatment.”"*

First, the Claimant argues that under the fair and equitable treatment standard of the
Treaty, “Crystallex could expect it and its investment to be treated consistently,
transparently, and in a manner free from ambiguity”.’? Consistency requires that
government decision-making in relation to an investor is orderly, timely and free of
serious administrative negligence. Separate government agencies must also act
coherently in their positions regarding an investor vis-a-vis one another. Transparency
requires that a host state make it possible for an investor to accommodate its behavior
to the state’s laws, regulations or policies.’*°

In this case, the Claimant contends that there was no consistency or transparency in
Venezuela’s decision to deny the Permit in April 2008, because, inter alia, the denial
decision does not explain the volte-face in respect of the 16 May 2007 EIS approval;
because it is not based on any technical analysis; and because it cannot be reconciled
with statements to the contrary from Government officials.”*! Furthermore, the MOC
rescission was entirely inconsistent with assurances, provided just months earlier in
response to Crystallex’s enquiry as to the status of the contract, that the MOC was valid
and in full force and effect. It is also inconsistent with statements made by the CVG’s
Vice-President — two months after the rescission — that Crystallex had thoroughly
complied with all of its obligations under the MOC.’ Finally, according to the
Claimant, between April 2008 and February 2011, Crystallex was subjected to a
veritable rollercoaster of inconsistent state conduct: one day Crystallex would receive
private assurances that it would be permitted to develop Las Cristinas; the next day the
President would publicly announce that it was “taking back” Las Cristinas.’**

 

 

Venezuela’s conduct, according to the Claimant, also evinces that there was no
coherence to the State’s actions.”* Venezuela’s own Permanent Committee for

Economic Development noted that there was a lack of coordination between various
Government agencies and departments with regard to the project.”*>

523. Further, Venezuela failed to respect procedural propriety and due process in its dealings
with Crystallex and its investment. In particular, because the Permit denial letter was
devoid of any data, figures, supporting evidence and documents, Crystallex could not
possibly understand the basis for the decision to deny the Permit, let alone effectively
challenge the substance of the Permit denial letter. Additionally, Crystallex was denied
due process of law when Venezuela failed to hear Crystallex's administrative appeal
following the Permit denial and to offer an administrative proceeding to Crystallex prior
to the termination of the MOC.”

524. The Claimant also contends that the Ministry of Environment failed to review
Crystallex's proposals diligently and coherently. The Claimant alleges that it lost
Crystallex's files on various occasions, and that it did not possess an internal
documentary record of how it reviewed and responded to Crystallex's project, and that
it admitted that "many of the decisions (if they were made at all) were oral’”.”°”

525. Finally, the Claimant submits that Venezuela made clear that from a certain moment
on, it did not wish to develop Las Cristinas with a partner from Canada, but rather with
a partner from one of its preferred trading partners or “sister nations”. Thus, the
Claimant suggests that Crystallex’s nationality was a decisive factor in Venezuela’s
decisions to deny the Permit, rescind the MOC and take back physical control over Las
Cristinas.”* The Claimant points to statements and actions by Venezuelan Minister
Sanz and President Chavez to show that Crystallex’s Canadian nationality made it an
unsuitable partner to develop Las Cristinas. It also cites the VenRus presentation, which
stated that developing Las Cristinas with a foreign enterprise domiciled in Canada
would be against Venezuelan state policy.”?

526. The Respondent, in turn, submits that Venezuela never acted negligently nor
incoherently. Part of the reason for delay in the analysis by the Ministry was due to
Crystallex’s own conduct, as it took Crystallex long periods of time to address the

Ministry’s requests. The Government diligently provided ample feedback to Crystallex
during the course of the years both orally and in writing.”*°

The Respondent avers that Crystallex’s reconsideration and appeal were adjudicated in
full compliance with Venezuelan law. The fact that the Ministry of Environment did
not render a decision on the hierarchical appeal within 90 days was not arbitrary since
the hierarchical appeal was deemed denied under Venezuelan law upon the Minister’s
failure to respond after 90 days, at which point Crystallex had legal recourse to
challenge the denial (which Crystallex chose not to do).”! Also with regard to the
rescission of the MOC, the relevant Resolution advised Crystallex that it could file an
administrative appeal of the CVG’s decision within 15 days (which Crystallex also did
not pursue).’4

Abusive conduct and bad faith

The Claimant argues that Venezuela’s conduct towards Crystallex was abusive in that
(i) Venezuela’s motivation behind the denial of the Permit and the rescission of the
contract “was to transfer Crystallex’s investment over to a third party for improper
reasons, which Venezuela ultimately effected with its agreement with CITIC”; (ii)
“Venezuela used the Permit that it was wrongfully withholding as a guid pro quo to
effect the seizure of Crystallex’s other properties in the country such as the Revemin
mill” and (iii) Venezuela was effectively unjustly enriched by using Crystallex's efforts
at developing Las Cristinas (including the further exploration of its reserves) to
subsequently obtain a new partner.”4? Furthermore, for the reasons discussed earlier,
the Claimant submits that both the Permit denial letter and the MOC rescission were
measures that lacked good faith.”4

The Respondent disagrees that its conduct was abusive or in bad faith. It claims that
neither the CITIC Framework Agreement nor the CITIC Studies Agreement granted
any mining rights. With regard to providing third parties with studies undertaken by
Crystallex, Respondent counters that it is the practice of the Ministry of Mines to
provide prior studies to new contractors engaged to produce such studies. The
Respondent also alleges that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that CITIC, or any
other entity, was a factor at the time the CVG rescinded the Moc.”45 Finally, the

2. Analysis
a. The content of the standard

530. | The Tribunal starts its analysis of FET by elucidating the content of the standard. In
this respect, the Tribunal begins with the examination of the formulation “in accordance
with the principles of international law”, which is found in Article II(2) of the Treaty,
quoted above.”*” The Tribunal is of the opinion that the FET standard embodied in the
Treaty cannot — by virtue of that formulation or otherwise — be equated to the
“international minimum standard of treatment” under customary international law, but
rather constitutes an autonomous treaty standard. Unlike treaties such as NAFTA,
which expressly incorporate the minimum standard of treatment,’*® the Canada-
Venezuela BIT nowhere refers to such minimum standard.

531. | The Tribunal notes that several non-NAFTA tribunals interpreting FET clauses similar
to the one at issue in this case have come to the conclusion that the reference to “in
accordance with principles of international law” (or analogous formulations) should not
be understood as a reference to the minimum standard of treatment.

532. In Vivendi v. Argentina, the tribunal made the following (well-known) comment with
respect to the applicable BIT’s provision which referred to FET “in conformity with
the principles of international law”:”4

“The Tribunal sees no basis for equating principles of international law with
the minimum standard of treatment. First, the reference to principles of
international law supports a broader reading that invites consideration of a
wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard alone.
Second, the wording of Article 3 requires that the fair and equitable treatment
conform to the principles of international law, but the requirement for
conformity can just as readily set a floor as a ceiling on the Treaty’s fair and
equitable treatment standard. Third, the language of the provision suggests

746 Rejoinder, para. 469.

747 See supra para. 491.

™48 See NAFTA, Article 1105, entitled “Minimum Standard of Treatment”. The NAFTA minimum standard of
treatment was the object of a binding interpretation by the Free Trade Commission, which is an authorized treaty
body with binding interpretative authority under that treaty.

equitable treatment in conformity with the principles of international law, and not to the minimum standard of
treatment. The French and Spanish text of the Treaty support this proposition. The French text reads ‘un traitement
i et équitable, conformément aux principes du Droit International’. The Spanish text refers to ‘un tratamiento
justo y equitativo, conforme a los principios de derecho internacional”).

that one should also look to contemporary principles of international law, not

+9 750

only to principles from almost a century ago”.
533. In Arif'v. Moldova the tribunal aptly noted that:

“The specific language adopted by France and Moldova in Article 3 connects
fair and equitable treatment with ‘public international law principles’,
although neither party has raised the question of whether this language limits
the fair and equitable treatment standard to the minimum standard of
treatment of aliens in customary international law. This question, except in
some very specific contexts such as Article 1.105 of NAFTA, is increasingly
of historic significance as the rapidly expanding practice on FET clauses in
treaties accelerates the development of customary international law. In any
event, the Tribunal is satisfied that the fair and equitable treatment standard
in Article 3 of the France- Moldova BIT is an autonomous standard given

Cap

534. As remarked by the tribunal in SAUR v. Argentina, the discussion as to whether the
BIT’s fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of international law
should be equated with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment
is “rather dogmatic and conceptual” (“wne discussion pluté6t dogmatique et
conceptualiste”).’*> This Tribunal agrees and is further of the view that the public
international law principles concerning the treatment of aliens have undergone
considerable developments since the Neer case, on which the Respondent relies as the
applicable benchmark to define FET. As a result of these developments, what is
considered now “fair and equitable” is different and broader than what was considered
as such at the beginning of the last century.’°*

535. This has been noted by a number of tribunals, including in the context of treaties, such
as the NAFTA or the DR-CAFTA, which unlike the present Treaty expressly refer to
the “minimum standard of treatment”. For example, the tribunal in ADF v. United
States, a case under NAFTA, noted that:

“what customary international law projects is not a static photograph of the
minimum standard of treatment of aliens as it stood in 1927 when the Award

in the Neer case was rendered. For both customary international law and the
minimum standard of treatment of aliens it incorporates, are constantly in a
process of development”.”™
536. The tribunal in RDC v. Guatemala in the context of the DR-CAFTA adopted the ADF
reasoning and shared the conclusion that the minimum standard of treatment is
“constantly in a process of development”, including since Neer’s formulation.”>

537. That being said, what, then, is the precise content of “fair and equitable treatment” in
this instance? The interpretation of Article II(2) of the Treaty should start from the
canons of treaty interpretation as contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.
Venezuela is not a party to the VCLT, but it is undisputed that the rules on the
interpretation of treaties contained in the VCLT reflect customary international law’°
and Venezuela relies on the VCLT to interpret the Treaty.”°7

538. To establish the content of the standard, the Tribunal must thus first turn to the plain
meaning of the terms “fair and equitable”. The plain meaning of these terms, however,
does not provide much assistance. As noted by the tribunal in MTD v. Chile, “[i]n their
ordinary meaning, the terms ‘fair’ and ‘equitable’ [...] mean ‘just’, ‘even-handed’,
‘unbiased’, ‘legitimate’”.’>* Similarly, the tribunal in S.D. Myers v. Canada stated that
unfair and inequitable treatment meant “treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner
that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international
perspective”.”*? This Tribunal agrees with the Sa/uka tribunal in that “[t]his is probably

as far as one can get by looking at the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of Article 3.1 of
>> 760

the Treaty”.

539,  Arbitral tribunals have on numerous occasions attempted to capture the somewhat
elusive essence of FET and, with a view to ascertaining the ordinary meaning of the
phrase “fair and equitable treatment’, have extracted a number of elements which they
considered inherent components of the standard. The Tribunal considers the findings
of these tribunals in this respect to be instructive as they evidence what is nowadays
considered to be the core of the “fair and equitable treatment” standard.

540. For example, the tribunal in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan stated that:

“The parties rightly agree that the fair and equitable treatment standard
encompasses inter alia the following concrete principles: - the State must act
in a transparent manner; - the State is obliged to act in good faith; - the State’s
conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic,
discriminatory, or lacking in due process; - the State must respect procedural
propriety and due process. The case law also confirms that to comply with
the standard, the State must respect the investor’s reasonable and legitimate

expectations”.”°!

541. — The tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine identified the following factors as part of the FET
standard:

“. whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal
framework; - whether the State made specific representations to the investor;
- whether due process has been denied to the investor; - whether there is an
absence of transparency in the legal procedure or in the actions of the State;
- whether there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad
faith conduct by the host State; - whether any of the actions of the State can

be labeled as arbitrary, discriminatory or inconsistent”.”

542. — And in Bayindir v. Pakistan, the ICSID tribunal derived from decisions of investment
tribunals the following principles as components of FET:

“the obligation to act transparently and grant due process, to refrain from
taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures, from exercising coercion or

545.

from frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the
legal framework affecting the investment”.”

Despite the different nuances in the definition of those principles formulated by those
and other tribunals, the Tribunal notes that there is a common understanding as to the
elements identified above. To the extent that they are relevant to the facts at issue in
this case, the Tribunal is of the view that FET comprises, inter alia, protection of
legitimate expectations, protection against arbitrary and discriminatory treatment,
transparency and consistency. The Tribunal believes that the state’s conduct need not
be outrageous or amount to bad faith to breach the fair and equitable treatment standard.
The Tribunal shares the observation made by the tribunal in Mondev, whereby “[t]o the
modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the
egregious. In particular, a state may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably
without necessarily acting in bad faith”. 7+

The Tribunal further wishes to point out that the analysis of whether a state’s conduct
has been fair and equitable requires an assessment of all the facts, context and
circumstances of a particular case. As stated in Mondev, “[a] judgment of what is fair
and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the

particular case”.”°

With those principles in mind, the Tribunal will first analyze whether the Claimant had
any legitimate expectations which the Respondent frustrated, thereby breaching the
FET standard (see infra Section VII.B.2.b). The Tribunal will then move to the other
“strands” invoked by the Claimant which the Tribunal finds relevant for the facts of
this case, i.e. non-arbitrariness, transparency and consistency (see infra Section
VII.B.2.c), before concluding on certain residual allegations on discrimination, due
process, and abusive/bad faith conduct (see infra Section VII.B.2.d). With regard to the
non-arbitrariness, transparency and consistency strands, the Claimant has invoked the
same facts as allegedly giving rise to a violation of more than one of these strands at
the same time. Indeed, while each of these concepts has an individual and separate
meaning, to which the Tribunal will revert when dealing with those specific elements,
their reach may in certain circumstances overlap. Thus, for example, a conduct may at
the same time be considered arbitrary and lacking transparency. Under the
circumstances of this case, it will thus be useful to address those strands in one single
section (see infra Section VII.B.2.c). In any event, the Tribunal emphasizes that, while

resort to the elements of which FET is composed may be a useful tool to assess the facts
in concrete cases, including this one, it is the overall evaluation of the state’s conduct
as “fair and equitable” that is the ultimate object of the Tribunal’s examination. Rather
than to focus on a mass of details and direct the analysis to specific instances of alleged
violations of the standard, the Tribunal will endeavor to establish whether an overall
pattern of conduct has emerged from these instances and whether that overall pattern
of conduct does indeed breach the standard.

b. Legitimate expectations

546. As already stated, the Tribunal agrees with the majority of investment tribunals which
have concluded that protection of legitimate expectations is now considered part of the
FET standard.” Arbitral tribunals have concluded that the doctrine of legitimate
expectations is “firmly rooted in arbitral practice”.”*’ The concept has its origins in
principles of domestic administrative law in various legal systems, and finds increasing
recognition both in civil and common law countries.”° Indeed, Venezuelan law
recognizes the concept of protection of legitimate expectations (confianza legitima) in
the citizen’s dealings with the Public Administration.”

547. | However, protection of legitimate expectations under the FET standard occurs under
well-defined limits. A legitimate expectation may arise in cases where the
Administration has made a promise or representation to an investor as to a substantive
benefit, on which the investor has relied in making its investment, and which later was
frustrated by the conduct of the Administration. To be able to give rise to such
legitimate expectations, such promise or representation — addressed to the individual
investor — must be sufficiently specific, i.e. it must be precise as to its content and clear
as to its form. Furthermore, as recalled by the Arif v. Moldova tribunal, “a claim based

on legitimate expectations must proceed from the exact identification of the origin of

the expectation alleged, so that its scope can be formulated with precision”.’””

Mindful of these limitations, the Tribunal turns to the examination of the Claimant’s
alleged legitimate expectations. While the precise articulation of its expectations has
somewhat varied throughout its pleadings, in its post-hearing brief the Claimant has
summarized its allegations concerning legitimate expectations by distinguishing three
moments on which they arose: the time of making its initial investment; upon receipt
of the 16 May 2007 letter; and between July 2008 and the rescission of the MOC and
the Government take-over of Las Cristinas. For the purposes of a proper understanding
and analysis of the Claimant’s alleged legitimate expectations, the Tribunal finds it
useful to reproduce verbatim the Claimant’s latest articulation of its expectations.

The Claimant contends that:

A. At the time of making its investment:

i. “Crystallex had a legitimate expectation under the FET standard that a host
State would act with ‘economic rationality’, ‘reasonableness’ and
‘proportionality’ as a baseline of treatment toward its investment”;’”!

ii. “Crystallex had the legitimate expectation that if it fulfilled its contractual and
regulatory obligations, it would enjoy its exclusive right to exploit the Las
Cristinas mine for an initial period of 20 years (extendable for two 10-year
periods), as set out under the MOC”;772

iii. “Crystallex had the legitimate expectation, rooted in the applicable Venezuelan
legal framework, that the process for the issuance of the environmental Permit
required in order to exploit the mine would be a technical process, as
Venezuela’s own witnesses have acknowledged it ought to have been.
Crystallex had the legitimate expectation that if it fulfilled all of the technical
requirements set out in the applicable Venezuelan legal framework, and
received approval of those technical requirements, then it would be granted the
Permit to exploit Las Cristinas”;”

B. “Upon receipt of the Ministry of the Environment’s 16 May 2007 letter approving

Crystallex’s EIS and promising that the Permit would be “handed over” once the

requisite bond was posted,”

iv. “Crystallex had a legitimate expectation that the Permit would be delivered

promptly”.””*

C. “Between July 2008 and the rescission of the MOC and Government takeover of the

Las Cristinas Project in early 2011, Crystallex continued to have legitimate
expectations that”:

v. “the Venezuelan Government would act coherently, transparently and in good
faith in deciding Crystallex’s appeal of the Permit denial”;’”>

vi. “the Venezuelan Government would evaluate the adjusted proposal that it
submitted to the Ministry of the Environment in August 2008 at the Vice-
Minister’s request with a view to issuing the Permit, as required under

Venezuelan law;”7”°

a.

. “it would be permitted to develop the Las Cristinas Project, based on assurances
provided by high-level Venezuelan Government officials, none of which have
been denied by Venezuela in this Arbitration”;’”” and

viii. “its MOC would not be arbitrarily rescinded without the payment of
>> 778

compensation contrary to the terms of the MOC and Venezuelan law”.
Except for the expectation arising out of the 16 May 2007 letter (supra sub iv.), which
the Tribunal will deal with below, the Tribunal finds that the expectations as articulated
by the Claimant are not “legitimate expectations” protected under the FET standard in
the Treaty, for the following reasons.

A first set of expectations that the Claimant postulates present, in the Tribunal’s view,
a circularity of argument that make them incapable of providing a basis for an FET
breach. Thus, to take as example the expectations that the Claimant alleges sub i. and
v. above, the Claimant, to use the words of the tribunal in Arif v. Moldova, simply
“postulate[s] an expectation to condemn the very conduct that it complains of in the
case before it”.””? For example, to state that one has a legitimate expectation under the
FET to be treated reasonably or proportionally (as the Claimant does sub i.) is
tantamount to saying that one has a legitimate expectation to be treated “fairly and

equitably”. The same circularity of reasoning underlies the alleged expectation that the
Respondent “would act coherently, transparently and in good faith in deciding
Crystallex’s appeal of the Permit denial” (sub v.).

In other instances, the Claimant’s postulated expectation would amount to an
understanding that Venezuela comply with the regulatory framework in place or with
the MOC (see expectations swb ii., iii., vi., and viii). With regard to the expectations
based on the regulatory framework, the Tribunal observes that this is not a case where
a claimant alleges that it has relied on an existing framework which the state has later
changed allegedly in breach of the investor’s legitimate expectations. Rather, the
argument is that Crystallex was not granted a Permit under the existing framework. It
is rather trite to note that the investor may consider the regulatory framework at the
time of the decision to invest and rely on the state's intent to comply with its own laws
(patere legem quam ipse fecisti). However, a simple general “expectation” of the state’s
compliance with its laws may not always and as such form the basis of a successful
FET claim. It would form such a basis if evidence is given that a specific representation
as to a substantive benefit has been frustrated, or there is proof of arbitrary, or non-
transparent conduct in the application of the laws in question or some form of abuse of
power. Otherwise, it is necessary for the investor to take into consideration that, in the
administrative decision-making process, considerations of public interest or going to
the specific circumstances of the case may counterbalance what the investor would
view as an expectation. Laws are general and impersonal in nature; they will usually
leave some degree of discretion to the state agencies for the making of their case-
specific decisions and, in fact, are rarely unconditional in their provisions so that the
investor would have difficulty founding an actual expectation akin to a vested right. As
a matter of fact, in this very case the “expectations” as to the substantive benefit (i.e.,
the grant of the Permit and the enjoyment of “the exclusive right to exploit the Las
Cristinas mine”), which the Claimant grounds on the MOC and the regulatory
framework governing the exploitation of mining activities, were conditioned upon the
Claimant’s fulfillment “of its contractual and regulatory obligations” (see supra sub ii.)
or “of all the technical requirements” (see supra sub iii.), as the Claimant itself
recognizes.

The Claimant also alleges that the “assurances provided by high-level Venezuelan
Government officials” gave rise to its expectations “that it would be permitted to
develop the Las Cristinas Project” (see supra sub vii.). The Tribunal finds that, with the
already mentioned exception of the 16 May 2007 letter, the “assurances” on which the
Claimant relies are too general and indeterminate to found a claim of legitimate
expectations under the Treaty. For example, it is clear that no legitimate expectation as
to the issuance of the environmental Permit may be said to arise out of the rather generic
statement by the Ministry of Mines in June 2005 that the Permit was “well on track”.”*°

‘Venezuela: Crystallex gold mine permit ‘on track’,” Reuters, 3 June 2005, Exh. C-12.

145

781

The Ministry of Mines had no control over the environmental Permit and at that time
(June 2005), it had not yet even approved the Feasibility Study.

Similarly, the June 2006 statement by the President of the Commission of Mines of the
National Assembly, Deputy Ricardo Gutiérrez, and the Mayor of Sifontes, expressing
their joint support for the commencement of the Las Cristinas Project’*! could not create
any legitimate expectations as to whether the Ministry of Environment would decide to
grant the Permit.

Furthermore, no legitimate expectations protected under the Treaty could arise from the
statements as they are reported in the minutes of the National Assembly meeting held
on 4 October 2007. According to these minutes, the only representative from the
Ministry of Environment that participated in that meeting, its then Planning Director,
Sergio Rodriguez, merely “referred, in general, to environmental aspects. He also
agreed with the matters related to the participation of Community Councils in the
Projects to be developed”.”*? In the Tribunal’s view, such vague statements do not meet
the level of specificity required to create legitimate expectations which, if later
frustrated, are relevant for a finding of an FET breach.

The situation, however, is different when it comes to the 16 May 2007 letter from the
Office of Permission of the Ministry of Environment to Crystallex, in respect of which
closer scrutiny is necessary.

As a preliminary matter, that letter dates back to a moment when Crystallex had already
made significant investments. A legitimate expectation is normally said to arise “at the
time of making the investment”.”** In the Tribunal’s eyes, this is logical, as it is the
investor’s reliance on a promise which may prompt, or contribute to, its decision to
invest and proceed with that investment, and which makes in turn the expectation
worthy of legal protection. In certain cases, however, “investments are made through
several steps, spread over a period of time”.’** As the tribunal in Frontier Petroleum v.
Czech Republic noted, in these instances “legitimate expectations must be examined
for each stage at which a decisive step is taken towards the creation, expansion,

development, or reorganisation of the investment”.’*° In this case, Crystallex continued
to invest throughout the process, and made investments after the 16 May 2007 letter.’*°
Therefore, the 16 May 2007 letter is in principle capable of founding a claim of
legitimate expectations, if it fulfills the requisite characteristics of a specific promise,
which was later frustrated. It is to this aspect that the Tribunal now turns.

In this context, the Tribunal will address the following questions in turn: (i) what is the
scope and import of the 16 May 2007 letter and is it the formal approval of the EIS?;
(ii) did the approval relate to the entire project, or only to preliminary works?; (iii) did
the Permit that was promised in the letter relate to exploration or exploitation?

i. The scope and import of the 16 May 2007 letter

One first area of disagreement between the Parties concerns whether the 16 May 2007
letter constitutes the formal approval of the EIS, as the Claimant contends. The
Respondent denies that this is the case.”

The Tribunal sees some force in Venezuela’s argument that the 16 May 2007 letter is
not the official approval of the EIS (the “accreditation” of the project, in Venezuelan
law parlance). Indeed, if such letter is compared to the 1996 Oficio from the Ministry
of Environment to the Vice-President of Minera Las Cristinas,’** the May 2007 letter
appears different and much less detailed. The difference between the two documents
has also been conceded at the hearing by the Claimant’s Venezuelan law expert, Mr.
Meier.’*°

However, it is not necessary to determine whether the 16 May 2007 letter was the
formal accreditation of the project. As a matter of fact the Tribunal is of the view that,
even if the 16 May 2007 letter were not considered as the formal accreditation of the
project, but rather as a mere request for a bond (as Venezuela and its experts contend),
the explicit statements contained therein cannot be disregarded:

“[The bond] shall guarantee the implementation of the measures proposed in
the document presented for the Environmental Impact Evaluation of the

project, which have been analyzed and approved by this Office, and are
presented as follows [list of measures follows]: [...]

Once the Bond has been posted, checked, and found to be compliant by this

Office, the Authorization for the Affectation of Natural Resources for the

execution of the activities associated with the project, "Construction of

Infrastructure and Services and for the Gold Ore Exploration State of

the Las Cristinas Project" to be carried out within the jurisdiction of the

Autonomous Municipality of Sifontes in Bolivar State, will be handed

over”.””
The Tribunal notes that the letter clearly makes reference to an evaluation process
carried out by the Ministry, when it specifies that the measures proposed in the EIS
have been “analyzed”. It also adds that these measures have been “approved” by “this
Office”, i.e., the Administrative Office of Permissions, which is in charge with
processing the requests for the relevant permits. Finally, the letter states in
unambiguous terms that “once the Bond has been posted, checked, and found to be
compliant by this Office, [...] the [Permit] [...] will be handed over” (“/e sera
entregado”). The use of the indicative mode and the future tense — expressing a fact
rather than a possibility or a conjecture — and the structure of the sentence make it clear
that the Administration has come to the conclusion that the process of analysis and
approval has been completed and that the Office of Permissions is ready to “hand over”
the Permit, once the Bond formality is cleared. It seems obvious to the Tribunal that at
that time, a positive decision by the Administration towards the granting of the Permit
had been taken.

The Tribunal thus considers that, whether or not the 16 May 2007 letter was the formal
“accreditation” of the project, it is much more than a mere request for a bond, as
‘Venezuela submits. The letter contains a phrase — “the Permit will be handed over” —
which would mean much more and appears on its face as a positive representation made
by vice-minister Garcia specifically to Crystallex in clear and precise terms, to the
effect that the Office of Permissions would continue with the procedures associated
with the permitting process. As such, the 16 May 2007 letter was susceptible of creating
the type of legitimate expectation that, if later frustrated, is protected under the FET
standard.

In the Tribunal’s view, Crystallex legitimately relied on the Ministry of Environment’s
representation. Such expectation was further strengthened by the Ministry’s request
made on the same day to Crystallex (through the CVG) to pay the environmental
taxes.”! The Stamp Tax Law provides that payment of the environmental taxes

becomes due “simultaneously” with the issuance of the relevant document, in this case
the Environmental Permit.” In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that the Ministry of
Environment requested the payment of the bond and the stamp taxes on 16 May 2007
could be construed as meaning that the Ministry had already made a favorable decision
with respect to the environmental Permit. Crystallex’s expectations that it would be
granted the Permit promptly after the posting of the bond and the payment of the taxes
was thus reasonable and legitimate. Such expectation was later frustrated by the
Respondent through the manner in which the Permit was denied and the MOC was
rescinded, to which the Tribunal will revert later.

ii. Did the approval relate to the entire project or only to preliminary
works?

565. | One further area of disagreement between the Parties concerns whether the approval
extended to the whole EIS or was only limited to preliminary works.’%

566. | The Tribunal starts by looking at the EIS submitted by Crystallex to the CVG at the end
of 2003, which the CVG then transmitted to the Ministry of Environment on 15 April
2004. This EIS clearly related to the whole project, i.e. it addressed the impact of the
entire Las Cristinas project, from construction through operation to mine closure.”*

567. It is true that initially Crystallex and the CVG appeared to consider that quicker
progress could be made if an early authorization could be obtained for certain
preliminary works that would prepare the site for major construction works. This is
reflected in the CVG’s letter of 15 April 2004 to the Ministry of Environment,
transmitting the EIS.’°> Crystallex claims, however, that in late 2004 this request was
“abandoned” as the Ministry took the view that the EIS for Las Cristinas had to be
approved before it would permit works to be undertaken that would impact the
environment.”°

568. | Upon review of the evidence in the record, the Tribunal is convinced that the initially
pursued preliminary works request was abandoned at a later stage, after which the

Stamp Tax Law. The taxable event for such duties is established in Article 27 of that same law:

simultaneously with the issuance of this document [...]”.

569.

discussions between the Venezuelan authorities and Crystallex centered on a Permit for
the entire project. This emerges in particular from the following documents on the
record. First, the 22 December 2006 minutes of the meeting between MINAMB, Gold
Reserve and the CVG make clear that on that occasion the Ministry of Environment
committed to two things: (1) a short-term track (“three months”) for the issuance of
permits to the CVG (Crystallex) and Gold Reserve; and (2) a long term track
(“approximately 3 years”) for two joint CVG (Crystallex)/Gold Reserve projects (the
“Community Landing Airstrip” and the “Sanitary Landfill designed for the area (San
Isidro Parish)”).’*’ The Tribunal finds it noteworthy that the list of works for which the
CVG (and Crystallex) were to receive a permit on a short-term basis included
“construction of the plant”, “opening pits”, and “aggregates plant”.’”* This confirms
that the CVG/Crystallex and the Ministry were at that time no longer discussing a
Permit for preliminary works, but a Permit for the whole project. The “Answers to
technical observations””” provided by Crystallex to the Ministry in February 2007
following the 22 December 2006 meeting do not in any way change the Tribunal’s
conclusions.8°

As a supplemental reason but also importantly, the Tribunal finds support for its
conclusion that the approval related to the entire project in the very Permit denial letter
of 14 April 2008, which is unequivocally intended to deny Crystallex’s right to exploit

the mine, and not preliminary works.*”! In other words, if the Respondent’s position
was correct (i.e., that the approval in the 16 May 2007 letter only related to preliminary
works and could only have led to the issuance of an equally limited preliminary permit),
then presumably the Permit denial would have had the same scope, i.e. it would have
been a Permit denial relating to preliminary works if these were the subject-matter of
the discussions. This is clearly not the case. Through the Permit denial letter, the
Venezuelan authorities considered, “in view of all the legal and technical considerations
expressed, not to proceed with [Crystallex’s] application to exploit gold in the Imataca
Forest Reserve”,*? and decided “not to approve the Affectation of Natural Resources

for the exploitation of gold in the Municipality of Sifontes in Bolivar State”.

570. The Tribunal thus concludes that the Permit which was to be “handed over” pursuant
to the 16 May 2007 letter related to the entire project, and not just to preliminary works.

iii. Did the Permit promised in the 16 May 2007 letter relate to
exploration or to exploitation?

571. It is further disputed between the Parties whether the promised Permit, to which the 16
May 2007 letter refers, concerned the exploration or the exploitation of gold.

572. The Tribunal observes that documents in the record make reference to both
“exploration” and “exploitation”. The 16 May 2007 letter notably refers twice in the
text (and once in the letterhead) to “exploration” (and not to “exploitation”), and so do
a few other documents.°™

573. However, other documents in the record, some contemporaneous to the 16 May 2007
letter, specify that what was being discussed between the Parties was “exploitation”.
For example, the cover letter by the CVG transmitting the bond to the Ministry refers
to the “Exploitation project”.® A further particularly important document is the letter
from the Director of the Ministry’s Office of Permissions to the CVG asking for some
formal corrections in the Bond, where the Ministry expressly refers to the exploitation

project.*°° The very Permit denial letter, discussed in the preceding section, is to the
same effect.5””

574. | Despite the possible confusion deriving from the use of “exploration” in certain
documents, based on the preponderance of the evidence and having also noted that
Crystallex (and before it, Placer Dome) had already completed the exploration phase,
the Tribunal concludes that the promised Permit was for “exploitation”.

575. In conclusion, the Tribunal rejects the claims of legitimate expectations as articulated
by the Claimant, with the exception of the one based on the 16 May 2007 letter. In this
respect, the Tribunal finds that the specific representation contained in the Ministry of
Environment’s letter of 16 May 2007 created a legitimate expectation in Crystallex that
the procedure of the permitting process would go ahead for the exploitation of gold
relating to the entire Las Cristinas project. As the Tribunal will clarify further, the
circumstances leading to the denial of the Permit are considered in violation with the
obligation to treat the investor fairly and equitably, for the reasons which will be
explained below when discussing the other “strands” under the FET. As such, the denial
is relevant for the legitimate expectations claim as upheld by the Tribunal, as the Permit
denial letter of 14 April 2008 frustrated such legitimate expectations, for the reasons
which will be explained below.

c.  Arbitrariness, lack of transparency and consistency

576. The Tribunal now addresses whether Venezuela’s conduct was arbitrary, lacking
transparency and consistency.

577. It is beyond peradventure that a conduct that is arbitrary is contrary to FET,*°® whether
or not a separate provision on prohibition of “arbitrary treatment” is present in the

treaty.*° An authoritative definition of arbitrariness was given by a Chamber of the ICJ
in the ELSI case, where the Court stated that:

“Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as
something opposed to the rule of law. [...] It is a wilful disregard of due
process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical
propriety.”*"”

578. | In the Tribunal’s eyes, a measure is for instance arbitrary if it is not based on legal
standards but on excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference, and taken for
reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker.*!!

579, | Furthermore, as noted by a number of arbitral tribunals, FET “requires that any
regulation of an investment be done in a transparent manner [...]”.*!? The Treaty
expressly deals with one aspect of transparency in Article XV.*!? Linked to the notion
of transparency is the concept of consistency, which requires that “[o]ne arm of the

State cannot [...] affirm what another arm denies to the detriment of a foreign

some preliminary observations, which are relevant especially when it comes to
evaluating the Respondent’s conduct in relation to the permitting process.

First, the Tribunal wishes to highlight that it is a state’s sovereign prerogative to grant
or deny a permit, particularly one that affects natural resources over which the state has
sovereign rights. The Tribunal thus does not share the Claimant’s presentation of the
issues in terms of it being “entitled” or having a “right” to a Permit. From the point of
view of international law, a state could not be said to be under an obligation to grant a
permit to affect natural resources, and would always maintain the freedom to deny a
permit if it so considers. It would, however, incur liability under the BIT if the treatment
of the investor in the process leading to the denial was unfair and inequitable, because
it was arbitrary, lacking transparency or consistency. Thus, Venezuela’s contention that
Crystallex had no “right” to a Permit appears in principle correct to the Tribunal,
because of course the “right” was conditioned on the Administration granting the
necessary approvals. These approvals, however, needed to be granted or denied afier
conducting a procedure which was not arbitrary and in which the applicant was treated
fairly.

This point leads the Tribunal to make a further preliminary observation on the
applicable standard of review applicable in a case such as here, where an investor
alleges that it was wrongfully denied a permit, and the host state contends that it was
entitled to deny it based on a number of legitimate concerns. The Parties disagree in
particular as to whether Crystallex did or did not meet “adequately” the requests and
“adequately” satisfied the concerns raised by the Venezuelan authorities, in particular
by the Ministry of Environment, during the permitting process,*!> concerns which were
then adduced as reasons for denying the Permit.

The Tribunal believes that in matters where a government regulator and/or
administration is called to make decisions of a technical nature, those government
authorities are the primary decision-makers called to examine the reports presented by
the applying investor and the available scientific data. As such, those governmental
authorities should enjoy a high level of deference for reasons of their expertise and
competence (which is assumed to be present in those institutions called to make the
relevant decisions) and proximity with the situation under examination. It is not for an
investor-state tribunal to second-guess the substantive correctness of the reasons which
an administration were to put forward in its decisions, or to question the importance
assigned by the administration to certain policy objectives over others.

That being said, it is equally clear that deference to the primary decision-makers cannot
be unlimited, as otherwise a host state would be entirely shielded from state

815 Compare, e.g., C-PHB, Section IILD. (“Crystallex provided all the information it was asked to provide”) with
R-PHB, paras 23-34 (discussing whether Crystallex adequately addressed the Ministry of Environment's
concerns).

responsibility and the standards of protection contained in BITs would be rendered
nugatory. As the Tribunal in Unglaube v. Costa Rica noted,

“deference, however, is not without limits. Even if such measures are taken
for an important public purpose, governments are required to use due
diligence in the protection of foreigners and will not be excused from liability
if their action has been arbitrary or discriminatory”.*!

Differently put, while the Tribunal will refrain from making findings as to whether or
not the concerns expressed by the Ministry were “adequately” addressed by the
Claimant, or whether the reasons put forward by the Respondent in denying the Permit
were substantively valid, the Tribunal will, in its review of the government conduct,
assess whether there have been serious procedural flaws which have resulted in the
Permit being arbitrarily denied, or in the investor being treated non-transparently or
inconsistently throughout the process and thereafter. It is with this standard of review
in mind that the Tribunal examines now the overall process between Crystallex and the
Venezuelan authorities.

The review of the record shows that the first years of exchanges between Crystallex
and the various actors involved on the Venezuelan side were characterized by a
constructive dialogue and reasonably cooperative interactions. It is evident to the
Tribunal that those individuals and institutions working with Crystallex “on the
ground” supported the project and showed considerable efforts of cooperation towards
the company. This is particularly the case of Crystallex’s contractual partner, the CVG,
as well as the Ministry of Mines, including in the early times key individuals such as
Ms. Laura Paredes, then Director-General of Mining Concession at the Ministry of
Mines.*"” Individuals holding positions which had no direct incidence on the permitting
process, but who nonetheless were involved as part of the state structure and had a
broader interest in the process moving forward, such as the President of the National
Assembly Committee on Economic Development, Ricardo Gutiérrez, also showed their
support on several occasions.

It is also obvious that the permitting process was a very complex procedure involving
different government agencies (at both national and local level) and various and
sometimes diverging interest groups (indigenous peoples, the local communities, the
so-called small miners and their families, etc.). It is thus not surprising that several years
passed from the moment when the MOC was signed to the moment where Crystallex
probably got the closest to obtaining a Permit (16 May 2007). It is equally not surprising
that voluminous exchanges, reports and correspondence were sent and examined by

Basic Industries and Mines, 21 November 2006, Exh. C-368 (noting that Crystallex had “complied with all its pre-
construction obligations” and urging the issuance of the Permit).

both sides, and that the Venezuelan authorities sought on numerous occasions
clarifications, integrations and corrections to the plans, projects and reports presented
throughout the years.

The Tribunal is of the view that, up to the 16 May 2007 letter, the investor was overall
treated in a straightforward manner. As the Tribunal has already explained, that letter
created a legitimate expectation in the Claimant that it had fulfilled all the conditions
required to obtain the long-sought Permit.

Less than one year later, the Permit denial letter of 14 April 2008 manifested a complete
volte-face to the previous course, and in particular to the promise contained in the 16
May 2007 letter. As one of the key documents in this arbitration, the Permit denial letter
warrants closer scrutiny.

The Permit denial letter, extending to a mere two and a half pages, purports to set out
the alleged reasons for denying the Permit. It refers to “serious environmental
deterioration in the rivers, soils, flora, fauna and biodiversity in general in the plot,
caused by uncontrolled mining activity due to the high presence of miners, generating
passive or environmental damage that negatively affect[s] the ecosystems in the area
with unpredictable characteristics”.®'® It considers, inter alia, that “the exploitation of
gold and copper in the Imataca Forestry Reserve by the representative company
constitutes, according to the environmental studies carried out recently in the area, a
considerable [e]ffect on the Forest which would generate irreversible damage to the
environment, combined with the effects that on a worldwide level are causing global
warming, a phenomenon that our country cannot escape”.*!? The Permit denial letter
concludes with the decision “not to approve the Affectation of Natural Resources for

the exploitation of gold in the Municipality of Sifontes in Bolivar State”.

There is no question that Venezuela had the right (and the responsibility) to raise
concerns relating to global warming, environmental issues in respect of the Imataca
Reserve, biodiversity, and other related issues. The Tribunal, however, believes that the
way they were put forward by Venezuela in the Permit denial letter presents significant
elements of arbitrariness and evidences a lack of transparency and consistency.

To begin with, the reference to global warming is particularly troublesome. In the
concrete circumstances of this case, such concern had not been raised a single time in
the innumerable occasions of exchanges occurred between the Claimant and the
Venezuelan authorities throughout the 4-year review process. At the hearing, Mr. Pedro

Romero, who alleged to have helped prepare the so-called Romero Report (on which
see paras. 595 - 597 infra), acknowledged that there is nothing in the administrative file
relating to any analysis of the issue of global warming or carbon emissions in relation
to the Las Cristinas project.**! To raise this concern for the first time in an attempt to
justify the denial of the Permit is a clear example of arbitrary and unfair conduct.

The Permit denial letter also mentions other concerns, such as the effect of illegal
mining or alteration of hydrology as apparent justifications for denying the Permit.
While these concerns were indeed raised throughout the review process, the letter
invokes them in vague terms and without any supporting authority. For the Tribunal,
Venezuela had the burden to elucidate the reasons for denying the Permit with some
kind of supporting data to explain why it was reaching the conclusion it reached. This
is especially important as a general matter because only a precise and reasoned denial
could afford Crystallex a true opportunity to challenge that denial (as the denial letter
itself states),*?* or to remedy the deficiencies of the project if it was to resubmit a more
“adequate” EIS (as at that time the MOC continued to be in force and thus a corrected
resubmission could not be ruled out). In this respect, it is particularly surprising that the
letter does not refer to a single page, chapter, or even study as a whole of what was
submitted by Crystallex throughout the years.

Instead of providing any scientific data to justify its conclusion, the letter refers to
“environmental studies carried out recently in the area”, to “research carried out by the

that we’re looking at in the Ministry constantly [...]”.

can enter an Appeal for Reconsideration of the content of this Administrative Order within fifteen (15) days
following the day of notification, to the official who handed it down, in accordance with the provisions of Article
94 of the Organic Law of Administrative Procedures”).

specialists competent in the matter”, and to “technical inspection reports”.**> However,
no copy of any of those “studies”, “research” or “reports” were attached to the Permit
denial letter. Nor does the letter identify those reports, their authors or the precise
recommendations contained therein. Without more detailed specifications or
explanations, these indeterminate references are, by any standards, entirely incapable

of providing any possibly sound justification for a decision.

The Tribunal further notes that the only internal report on which the Permit denial letter
appears to be based is the so-called Technical Inspection Report of September 2006 (or
“Romero Report”), which recommended the denial of the Permit.'** At the hearing and
in its post-hearing submission, the Claimant has insisted on the fraudulent nature of this
document.*> In the Tribunal’s view, while the incongruities surrounding the
authenticity of the Romero Report raise indeed serious doubts, the Tribunal need not
decide whether the document was fraudulently fabricated ex post facto, because the
Tribunal is in any event convinced that by its own terms the Romero Report is as
deficient as the Permit denial letter.

Indeed, the Romero Report, which is a few pages longer than the Permit denial letter
and is endowed with three photographs of the Las Cristinas area, admittedly refers to
the EIS in a few passages. Upon scrutiny, those references to the EIS, however, amount
to no more than paying lip service to such document. Like the Permit denial letter, no
scientific data or studies are attached to (or even referred to in) the Romero Report, and
the Report displays the same level of generality and vagueness as the Permit denial
letter.

The Tribunal is unable to see how thousands and thousands of pages submitted by
Crystallex, ensuing from years of work and millions of dollars of costs, could be so
blatantly ignored in both the Romero Report and the subsequent Permit denial letter.
The huge efforts spent by Crystallex in cooperative coordination, at least up to a certain
time, with its main partner, the CVG, entitled Crystallex to have its studies properly
assessed and thoroughly evaluated. In order to comply with treatment that can be
termed “fair and equitable”, such a dramatic halt to the project would have required
more than a few pages of nebulous statements—particularly given that the Ministry had
promised to “hand over” the Permit less than a year before. In light of the foregoing,
the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the Permit denial letter and the Romero Report
on which the first appears to be based are so fundamentally deficient that, to the eyes
of a reasonable third person, they “surprise a sense of juridical propriety”, to use the
words of the ICJ in ELSI. For the same reasons, the Permit denial letter frustrated

Crystallex’s legitimate expectation arising out of the specific promise contained in the
16 May 2007 letter.

598. | Furthermore, the Tribunal considers that the process leading to the Romero Report and
the Permit denial was also tainted by a serious lack of transparency towards the investor
in many respects. If the Ministry of Environment had considered global warming as an
issue in 2006 at the time of the Romero Report, it is highly problematic that it never
disclosed this to Crystallex until 14 April 2008, let alone invited the company to
comment on it. Furthermore and importantly, it constitutes non-transparent and
inconsistent conduct on the part of the Ministry of Environment to invite the investor
to pay a substantial bond and the environmental taxes through the 16 May 2007 letter,
if at the time of the Romero Report—i.e. eight months before—the same Ministry had
already come to the conclusion that the Permit had to be denied. Similarly noteworthy
is the fact that, in spite of the inconsistency between the Permit denial letter of 18 April
2008 and the 16 May 2007 letter (which had concluded that the Permit “will be handed
over”), the subsequent denial does not even attempt to explain the departure from the
conclusions reached only a few months before by the same Ministry.

599. The Respondent was unable to provide convincing explanations to these
inconsistencies. What appears to the Tribunal from the record is that, not long after the
favorable 16 May 2007 letter, changes in policy at the national level started to have
repercussions over the permitting process.*”° While the individuals and institutions “on
the ground” (i.e., the CVG and certain officials at the Ministry of Mines up to a certain
point), who were more closely involved in the project with Crystallex, continued to be
in favor of the project, political pressure regarding the project from the highest
Venezuelan officers began to pervade the process.

600. For example, on 15 August 2007, the President of the National Assembly Commission,
Mr. Gutiérrez, discussed the status of the project of Las Cristinas in a radio interview
and made it clear that the process was not anymore solely a matter of technical
assessment at the level of the competent ministerial offices, but involved now the very
President of Venezuela.*””

601. Following the Permit denial, the general political “climate” became more and more
unfavorable to Crystallex.

Thus, around the time the Vice-Minister of Environment referred to Crystallex’s latest
supplemented submissions informing it “that having fully studied the body of ideas
proposed in the aforementioned document, which tend to adhere to Government
guidelines in both environmental and social matters, this Office considers the
evaluation by our technicians to be useful in making a decision regarding whether to
take on the "Las Cristinas" Gold Project’”,§*8 President Chévez announced on 19
September 2008 that it was “taking back big mines” in Guayana, clearly referring to
Las Cristinas:

“In Guayana for example, we are taking back big mines, and one of them is
one of the biggest in the world. And do you know what it is? It’s gold, it’s
gold! That has been taken away from our country for a long time, the gold”.*”

Less than two months later, an official press release from the Ministry of Mines
announced the plan to seize Las Cristinas to boost Venezuela’s international reserves.

“He [Minister Rodolfo Sanz] added that the Las Cristinas mine, which used
to be managed by transnational company Crystallex, is expected to begin
being exploited in 2009. He said the mine will be reclaimed and operated by
the state.

Las Cristinas is considered one of Latin America’s most important gold
deposit and one of the largest in the world. With a capacity of approximately
31 million ounces of gold, its estimated value is $35 billion.

L.]

Sanz insisted on the necessity of recovering Venezuela’s largest deposits, the
objective being to increase the production capacity of strategic minerals, such
as gold, diamond, bauxite and uranium.

The government of Venezuela representative admitted that the production
capacity of gold had increased during this year, having reached its goal of
1.5 tons of gold.

‘As a result of the financial crisis spreading worldwide, we must try to
recover our gold in order to increase our international reserves’ [.. pee

The Tribunal is struck by the fact that the press release made no mention whatsoever of
the environmental concerns referred to in the 14 April 2008 Permit denial letter.

605. A peak of the politically adverse statements against Crystallex was reached on 13
January 2009 when President Chavez in his Annual Address to the Nation announced
the takeover of Las Cristinas and development through VenRus:

“[...] this year the Venezuelan State has taken over the exploitation and
control of the gold deposits of Las Cristinas at kilometer 88 in the State of
Bolivar; one of the largest gold deposits on the American continent. Cristinas
is estimated to have approximately 35.2 million ounces of gold, that is 1,094
metric tons of estimated reserves. Of this reserve, 24.5 million ounces, or 762
tons, are classified as proven.

In this way, the Venezuelan State controls 30,000 million dollars, which is
the current estimated worth of the deposit. Currently, 30 thousand. The Las
Cristinas concessions are organized into five parts: Cristina IV, Cristina V,
Cristina VI, Cristina VII and Brisas del Cuyuni. They are under the control
of socialism, for the development of economic growth for the national
development. [...]

In mining we have created this year (2008) the mixed company VenRus, with
Russia, a Russian company and a Venezuelan company, a mixed company
for the deposits of Las Cristinas”.**!

606. In the two following years (2009-2011), Crystallex was subject to a “roller-coaster” of
contradictory and inconsistent statements from the Venezuelan authorities. On the one
hand, Crystallex received several confirmations from the CVG that the MOC remained
in “full force and effect”,8*? and that it had thus to continue bearing the costs associated
with the control of the Las Cristinas site. On the other hand, around the same time,
President Chavez stated in the weekly TV show “Al6 Presidente” on 25 April 2010
that:

“Tf we are going to exploit gold, we will have to nationalize all of it,
recuperate and put an end to concessions, which led to degeneration [...]”.5*

On 17 October 2010, the Venezuelan state news agency (Agencia Venezolana de
Noticias) reported the following words pronounced by President Chavez during a state
visit to Belarus:

“Chavez announced the nationalization of the Las Cristinas and Las Brisas
mines. ‘Las Cristinas, this mine belongs to Venezuela and it has been handed
over to transnational companies, I announce to the world that the
revolutionary Government recuperated it, together with the Las Brisas mine.
These mineral resources are for the Venezuelan people, not for
transnationals,’ he said.”***

Minister of Mines Khan followed up on the threat a few months later and. In his
function of President of the CVG, Minister Khan rescinded the MOC, for reasons of
“opportunity and convenience” and because Crystallex had paralyzed activities for over

a year.*°5

Having regard to those political statements, it can be safely inferred that the change of
policy with respect to mining at the highest level of the Venezuelan state had a decisive
bearing on the permitting process first (with the denial of the Permit in 2008) and the
subsequent termination of the MOC in February 2011.

The Tribunal will come back to the reasons mentioned in the MOC rescission when
dealing with expropriation.**° For the purposes of the FET analysis, the Tribunal finds
that, within the framework of its assessment of Venezuela’s conduct, the MOC
rescission was part of a treatment that was unfair and inequitable towards Crystallex.
The Tribunal recalls that it is not called upon to pass judgment on whether there were
any contract breaches in relation to the MOC.**7 Its role is rather to assess whether the
treatment in respect of the MOC rescission (among other events) evinces elements of
arbitrariness or lack of transparency or consistency, which have resulted in a breach of
the FET standard contained in the Treaty.

The Tribunal believes that the documents in the record clearly show that the MOC
rescission was part of the unfair and inequitable treatment suffered by Crystallex on the
part of Venezuela. The Tribunal refers here in particular to the internal correspondence
between CVG officers following the MOC rescission.*** In an internal communication
dated 28 February 2011, the legal department of the CVG requested from its Vice-

President “information [...] regarding the reasons why Crystallex International
Corporation has paralyzed activities for over one (1) year”.**? The legal department
sought this information “in order to support the administrative record in question”,*“°
making it thus clear that it was lacking such basic information. The response supplied
by the Vice-President, Mr. Colmenares, on 17 March 2011 was that Crystallex had
executed all of its tasks under the MOC with the exception of gold exploitation, as it
did not have a Permit:

“[A]ccording to reports from the Liaison Office [...] Crystallex International
Corporation has completed the various tasks set forth in said Operation
Contract, with the exception of the tasks corresponding to the construction
and development stage of the exploitation phase [...] due to the fact that it
was not granted the Permit [...]”.*"!
This internal exchange evinces that the CVG officers, the ones who had been working
more closely with Crystallex on the project, were, at a minimum, not aware of any
contractual breach on the part of Crystallex and, possibly, were raising doubts about
the possibility and lawfulness of the rescission. In the eyes of the Tribunal, the exchange
displays, both in itself and in conjunction with further evidence in the record, the serious
procedural flaws which Crystallex was subjected to in its dealings with the Venezuelan
authorities.

Furthermore, by letter of 15 August 2010 (i.e., 6 months before the rescission), the CVG
had confirmed to Crystallex that the MOC remained “in full force and effect”.**? The
Tribunal considers that it cannot be reconciled with a “consistent” behavior on the part
of the CVG to tell Crystallex 6 months before the rescission that the MOC was in full
force and effect, without even hinting at any contractual violations, and to reproach 6
months thereafter (in February 2011) that Crystallex had paralyzed activities for one
year.

In the Tribunal’s eyes, all of these exchanges show that the rescission of February 2011
was not based on legal standards but based on reasons that are different from those put
forward by the decision-maker. This constitutes a clear form of arbitrary conduct and
as such is contrary to FET.

d. Discrimination, due process, abusive conduct and bad faith

As the Tribunal has already stated, non-discrimination and due process are central
components of FET.* They require separate consideration from the Tribunal in this
section, insofar as the Parties have made specific allegations related to those issues.

To show discrimination the investor must prove that it was subjected to different
treatment in similar circumstances without reasonable justification,*** typically on the
basis of its nationality or similar characteristics. The Tribunal believes that, under this
standard, the Claimant has not sufficiently established that it was discriminated against
by Venezuela. The Tribunal is of the view that no adequate comparator was presented
to its attention which would justify a conclusive finding on discrimination. It is true that
evidence on the record shows that Venezuela was considering at some point to enter
into a joint venture with Rusoro. However, the subsequent events concerning that joint
venture in relation to Las Cristinas are not sufficient to found a discrimination claim.
Furthermore, it is undisputed that Venezuela subsequently entered into a contractual
relationship with the Chinese company CITIC. The Tribunal, however, does not find
this to be an appropriate comparator either: the record does not furnish much evidence
about the exact circumstances around the CITIC contract and the subsequent conclusion
of a differently framed contract cannot easily be compared to the issue of the treatment
of Crystallex within the lifespan of the MOC. In other words, the Claimant has not
sufficiently established that the fact that Venezuela has entered into a contractual
relationship with a Chinese company after the fall-out of its relationship with Crystallex
proves discriminatory conduct against Crystallex. The Tribunal has of course not
overlooked the repeated and rather derogatory references to “transnationals” and
“transnational companies” in the President’s and some Ministers’ statements.*4> While
the Tribunal is not unsympathetic to Crystallex’s complains that it was targeted based
on its “transnational” nature and cannot exclude that discrimination actually occurred
under the circumstances, it is of the view that a showing of discrimination would require
more conclusive evidence of facts which are not reflected in the record.

The Claimant has further placed a certain emphasis, for this and other claims, on the
so-called VenRus Presentation.*4° The Tribunal has given such document due

consideration. It has, however, arrived at the conclusion that the Claimant has not
sufficiently established that this document is indeed attributable to Venezuela, rather
than to its possible Russian partner.**” Under these circumstances, there is no sufficient
ground for the Tribunal to find a possible supplemental breach of FET based on the
‘VenRus Presentation.

618. In relation to the subsequent contractual relations which Venezuela entered into with
the Chinese state-owned company CITIC, the Tribunal is equally unconvinced that this
is evidence of Venezuela’s abusive conduct (or even bad faith, as the Claimant
contends). Proof of this would entail supplying specific evidence of such conduct,
which the Claimant has not been able to sufficiently adduce. The Claimant’s specific
claims of abusive conduct and bad faith in relation to the CITIC agreements are thus
denied.

619. | The Tribunal finally deals with certain due process allegations made by the Claimant
in respect of the Permit denial. In this respect, the Claimant complains of both the
Director of Permissions’ decision on Crystallex’s motion for reconsideration and the
Ministry’s failure to reply to the subsequent hierarchical appeal, and alleges that its due
process rights have been violated by those acts and omissions. The Tribunal is not
insensitive to the Claimant’s dissatisfaction with the ruling on the motion for
reconsideration (essentially based on Crystallex’s alleged lack of standing) and with
the Ministry’s failure to render a decision on the hierarchical appeal. However, it notes
also the Respondent’s position that the Ministry’s failure to give a response to the
appeal within 90 days entitled Crystallex to consider the appeal denied under
Venezuelan law, thus entitling the investor to further recourse before the courts. It is
undisputed that Crystallex did not exercise such recourse.

620. The Tribunal has reviewed the Venezuelan law experts’ conclusions on this point.
‘Venezuelan law expert Prof. Iribarren has explained that an appeal is deemed denied or
rejected under Venezuelan law where a Minister does not reply to a hierarchical appeal
within a specific time-frame.*#* At the hearing, the Claimant’s Venezuelan law expert,

S47 At the hearing, both Minister Khan and Laura Paredes vigorously denied any involvement on the part of the
Ministry of Mines or VenRus in the drafting of the VenRus Presentation. See Tr. [Jurisdiction and Merits], Day 3,
797:16-798:4 and 798:12-799:5 (Khan); Tr. [Jurisdiction and Merits], Day 4, 1267:21-1268:4 (Paredes).

 

S48 ER Iribarren, para. 54 (“on May 12, 2008, a motion for reconsideration was filed before the Director General of
the Permitting Office of the Ministry of Environment, which was ruled inadmissible. Against this decision, the
current claimant filed an appeal before the Min[i]ster of the Mi ‘y of Environment, which was also dismissed as
a result of the adverse effect of administrative silence”, emphasis added). See also Tr. [Jurisdiction and Merits],
Day 7, 1788:19-1789:13 (Iribarren) (““Crystallex brought a hierarchical remedy before the Ministry of the
Environment that was never answered--or that has not been answered to this date, and that’s how far Crystallex
went. That is to say, Crystallex never brought an action of nullity on the basis of illegality, on the basis of silence
so as to then go before the contentious-administrative jurisdiction to challenge the contents of 1427 [the Permit
denial]. So, the first thing I must say with respect to the Official Communication, looking at this procedural aspect
of what we're talking about, it is an act that is also vested with the principle of legality, and is considered to be
self-enforcing and final. And under Venezuelan law, it is considered valid until its nullity is declared by the
competent bodies of the administrative jurisdiction [...]”.).

Prof. Meier, acknowledged the effect of such administrative silence, yet contended that
such silence only works as a guarantee in favor of the private person, and not in favor
of the administration, so that only the private person can benefit from that guarantee.*”°
Whatever the merits of such last argument, it is the Tribunal’s view that in these
circumstances the Claimant’s due process allegations in relation to the motion for
reconsideration and the hierarchical appeal have not been sufficiently established. They
are thus rejected. In any event, the Tribunal is of the view that this course of events
would not add anything to the FET breach itself, which the Tribunal considers
established for the reasons explained in detail above.

Similarly, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not been able to sufficiently
establish that due process was violated because no prior administrative procedure was
started by the Venezuelan authorities before the termination of the MOC.

The Tribunal wishes to point out that its rejection of some specific allegations of
discrimination, due process and abusive/bad faith conduct in relation to specific events
as not sufficiently proven in no way affects its conclusion that Venezuela through its
overall conduct has treated Crystallex unfairly and inequitably in violation of Article
II(2) of the Treaty.

In conclusion, Venezuela has violated the “fair and equitable treatment” clause

contained in Article II(2) of the Treaty. The Respondent frustrated Crystallex’s
legitimate expectations arising out of the specific promise contained in the 16 May

“9 See Tr. [Jurisdiction and Merits], Day 6, 1644:10-1645:14 (Meier):

“Q. [...] The lack of an answer or a response, without prejudice to it being a
constitutional violation, does not have under Venezuelan le; ition any specific
effect provided for when the administration does not rule on a petition or request or
in this case an appeal or remedy, does the Venezuelan legislation not consider that
the appeal should be considered denied with the effect of administrative silence?

 

 

 

A. Well, that's the concept of administrative silence, but I must clarify this for you
because I've studied that quite a bit, and I was a Professor of Administrative Law for
30 years. That is a guarantee in favor of the private person, not in favor of the
administration, so only the private person can take cover in that guarantee and
consider that the petition has been rejected so as to then be able to immediately file
the next appeal or remedy, but they may not do, and the passage of time doesn't affect
them because it guarantee in favor of the private person, but it is not to facilitate
things for the administration.

 

 

Q. But this guarantee for the private person existing, the private person could make
use of it; and, consequently, file a contentious-administrative action against the Act
if they want to?

A. If they want on to, but they have the right to wait for the response however much
time may go by.”

2007, engaged in arbitrary conduct in denying the Permit and rescinding the MOC, and
committed several acts lacking transparency and consistency, as described above. By
way of its overall conduct vis-a-vis Crystallex, the Respondent thus violated the FET
standard contained in Article II(2) of the Treaty and thereby caused all of the
investments made by Crystallex to become worthless, which will be further established
below.

FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY
1. The Parties’ Positions

The Claimant submits that Venezuela has breached Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing
to provide Crystallex’s investment full protection and security. Article II(2) of the
Treaty provides that “[e]ach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the principles
of international law, accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting
Party [...] full protection and security”.

According to the Claimant, this standard extends beyond the physical security of an
investment to an obligation on behalf of a host State to provide “the stability afforded
by asecure investment environment”.*™ The Claimant has referred to arbitral decisions
holding that full protection and security is a standard not limited to physical protection
but extending also to legal security.*°! For the Claimant, a concept of full protection
and security limited solely to physical protection would not take into account the
modern commercial and business context in which investment treaties are framed. The
Claimant argues that the full protection and security standard without qualifications
contained in the Belarus-Venezuela BIT can be imported through the Canada-
Venezuela Treaty's most-favored-nation (MFN) clause.*°?

With regard to the standard’s application to the facts, the Claimant submits that there
were a number of instances of administrative negligence on the part of Venezuela which
have constituted a breach of the full protection and security standard. These included
Venezuela’s decision to declare Crystallex's motion for reconsideration inadmissible
(after the Permit denial) and the failure to render a decision following Crystallex's
hierarchical appeal.*** In this respect, the Claimant submits that either the Ministry of

Environment should have allowed Crystallex to file its appeal on its own or the CVG
should have joined the appeal, and that the Ministry of Environment should have given
“full consideration” to Crystallex’s motion for reconsideration and hierarchical
appeal.5>+

The Claimant further argues that senior Venezuelan officials made a number of
discriminatory statements threatening to nationalize Crystallex's investment and/or
transfer it to other interested parties, and that such "statements of harassment" were not
in accord with the full protection and security standard under the Treaty.**

The Respondent submits that the obligation to accord full protection and security under
Article II(2) of the Treaty is the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law (due to the qualifier “in accordance with the principles of international
law”), and it is limited to physical protection and security of an investment.**° In
addition, the Respondent relies on Canada's treaty-making practice which it claims
“confirms that the full protection and security standard under the Treaty does not
provide economic or legal security or protection”.*°” According to the Respondent,
Canada has consistently stated that its post-NAFTA BITs (including the Treaty) are
based on the NAFTA, are consistent with its provisions, and that Article 1105 of
NAFTA prescribes the minimum standard of treatment under customary international
law. Therefore, Article II(2) of the Treaty should not be interpreted as going beyond
the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.***

Whatever the interpretation of the content of the full protection and security standard,
the Respondent argues that Crystallex has failed to establish that Venezuela has
breached its obligations under Article II(2) of the Treaty.

The Respondent argues that the regulatory actions taken with respect to the denial of
the Permit, and the re-affirmance of that denial, were consistent with Venezuelan law
and international law.**? The fact that the Claimant chose not to avail itself of the
judicial protection offered (i.e., the administrative and judicial appeals procedures
against the denial of the Permit and the termination of the MOC) does not mean that
legal protection did not exist.*

631. Finally, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant failed to establish that Venezuelan
officials made statements that could have "reasonably been expected to prompt types
of harassment" .°°!

2. Analysis

632. The Parties have proposed two different interpretations of the “full protection and
security” provision in Article II(2) of the Treaty. The Claimant submits that “full
protection and security” extends to protection of legal security and the stability of the
legal environment, whereas the Respondent contends that such standard should be
limited to physical protection and security. The Tribunal is of the view that “full
protection and security” is a distinct treaty standard whose content is not to be equated
to the minimum standard of treatment. However, the Tribunal considers that such treaty
standard only extends to the duty of the host state to grant physical protection and
security.* Such interpretation best accords with the ordinary meaning of the terms
“protection” and “security”.

633. Furthermore, this interpretation is supported by a line of cases involving the same or a
similar phrase. For example, the tribunal in Sa/uka noted that “[t]he practice of arbitral
tribunals seems to indicate [...] that the ‘full security and protection’ clause is not meant
to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor’s investment, but to protect more
specifically the physical integrity of an investment against interference by use of
force”.®® And the tribunal in Rumeli held that this standard of treatment “obliges the
State to provide a certain level of protection to foreign investment from physical
damage”.* Other arbitral decisions are to the same or similar effect.** The Tribunal
agrees with this line of cases.

861 Counter-Memorial, para. 421.

8©2 To be clear, this is the meaning that the Tribunal attributes to “full protection and security” irrespective of
whether the clause is accompanied by the formulation “in accordance with principles of international law” (as in
the present case). Thus, there is no need to decide whether the Claimant may import the allegedly more favorable
treatment contained in the Belarus-Venezuela BIT through the MEN clause in the basic treaty, as nothing in the
record sufficiently shows that an interpretation of the terms “full protection and security” in the Belarus-Venezuela
BIT would be different.

634. The Tribunal is mindful that other investment tribunals have interpreted the “full
protection and security” standard more extensively so as to cover legal security and the
protection of a stable legal framework.*® As already noted, the Tribunal is of the view
that the more “traditional” interpretation better accords with the ordinary meaning of
the terms. Furthermore, as rightly observed by a number of previous decisions, a more
extensive reading of the “full protection and security” standard would result in an
overlap with other treaty standards, notably FET,*°’ which in the Tribunal’s mind would
not comport with the “effet utile” principle of interpretation.** The Tribunal is thus
unconvinced that it should depart from an interpretation of the “full protection and
security” standard limited to physical security.*?

635. Measured against this standard, the Claimant has not alleged, let alone shown, that it
was subjected to a violation of its physical security attributable to Venezuela. The
Tribunal thus dismisses the Claimant’s claim of breach of the “full protection and
security” clause contained in Article II(2).

EXPROPRIATION
1. The Claimant’s Position
a. The taking of specific contractual rights constitutes expropriation

The Claimant first submits that it had rights capable of being expropriated under the
Treaty. Clause 2 of the MOC granted Crystallex the exclusive right:

“to undertake all of the investments and works necessary to reactivate and
execute in its totality the Mining Project of [Las Cristinas], design, build the
plant, operate it, process the gold for its subsequent commercialization and
sale, and return the mine and its installations to the [CVG] upon the
termination of the Contract [...] [and] to exploit and extract gold in the area
[of Las Cristinas] [...]”.5”°

For the Claimant, these rights are investments under the Treaty, defined in Article
I(f)(vi) as “right[s], conferred [...] under contract, to undertake any economic and
commercial activity [...]”.87! For the Claimant, these rights existed at the time the MOC
was signed and they existed until the MOC was unilaterally rescinded and the Las
Cristinas site was physically taken over by the Venezuelan Government in early
2011.87

Thus, the Claimant argues, the destruction of contractual rights can amount to an
expropriation and relies in this respect on what it considers to be unanimous
jurisprudence.*”?

b. Venezuela has indirectly expropriated Crystallex's entire investment

The Claimant first contends that Venezuela indirectly expropriated its investment
through a series of cumulative and interconnected measures that began with the denial
of the Permit by the Ministry of the Environment, and ended with the destruction of
Crystallex’s rights through the CVG’s rescission of the MOC.

The Claimant submits that it is a well-accepted principle of international law that an
expropriation may occur indirectly and refers to a number of legal authorities and
decisions to this effect,” as well as to Article VII of the Treaty pursuant to which an
"investment" may not be expropriated or “subjected to measures having an effect

equivalent to nationalization or expropriation”.’”> Furthermore, according to the
Claimant, it is commonly accepted that expropriation can be creeping where there is an
incremental encroachment on a foreign investor’s ownership rights which decreases the
value of its investment until that investment no longer has value.*”°

According to the Claimant, the critical factor for a finding of expropriation is the actual
effect of the measure on the investment. If a measure destroys the investment or
substantially deprives an investor in whole or in part of the use or enjoyment of its
investment, it amounts to an expropriation.*”” Neither the form, nor the purpose, nor
the intent of the measures affects their characterization as expropriatory.*”

The Claimant finally submits that a host State can expropriate an investment by denying
or failing to issue a Permit or license which is critical for an investment project®””, and
that the unjustified termination of a contract based on sovereign prerogatives is
expropriatory.**°

According to the Claimant, Venezuela indirectly expropriated Crystallex’s investment
through the following series of measures:

The Ministry of Environment illegitimately denied the Permit in April 2008.
Crystallex claims to have completed all the necessary steps it was required to take
according to the applicable legal framework for the Permit to be handed over. In
particular, it was granted the Land Occupation Permit, its Feasibility Study was
approved, and so was the Environmental Impact Study. Furthermore, it posted the
Bond in response to the Ministry of Environment’s request dated 16 May 2007, and
paid the necessary environmental duties. In addition, throughout the process it
received repeated government assurances that it would obtain the Permit. Finally,
while the refusal to grant the Permit was officially motivated by alleged concerns
over the protection of the environment and indigenous peoples in the Imataca Forest
Reserve, no explanation or evidence was provided as to how these concerns related
to the Las Cristinas project.**!

Following the denial of the Permit, Crystallex was denied administrative remedies.
The Claimant points to the fact that its motion for reconsideration of the decision to
deny the Permit was declared inadmissible on 29 May 2008, and that no decision was

ever rendered with regard to the subsequent hierarchical appeal filed before the
Minister of the Environment.**

Venezuelan authorities repeatedly assured Crystallex in June and August 2008 that
the conditions for the Permit were fulfilled.*

Venezuela threatened to nationalize the project at certain intervals between
September 2008 and October 2010. In particular, the Claimant points to statements
by President Chavez and Minister Rodolfo Sanz manifesting their intention to “take
back” Las Cristinas.**

Venezuela terminated the MOC without justification and based on purely political
motives. Such termination took Crystallex's rights, ordered the transfer of all assets
to the CVG and made the denial of the Permit irreversible. In this respect, the
Claimant points to the CVG Resolution terminating the MOC, which cited the
Government’s sovereign prerogative to terminate contracts for “reasons of
opportunity and convenience”, as evidence that Venezuela acted in its sovereign
powers and not as a contractual party.**>

According to the Claimant, the aforementioned measures deprived Crystallex of all of
the economic value of its investment, and their cumulative and incremental effect was,
to use the language of Article VII of the Treaty, “equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation”.**° The actions toward Crystallex’s investment were taken outside of the
existing regulatory and contractual framework, in the exercise of the state’s sovereign
powers,**’ and were characterized by lack of reasonableness and proportionality.***
Venezuela’s termination of the MOC further constitutes a direct
expropriation of Crystallex's investment

According to the Claimant, a taking may start off as an indirect expropriation and end
as a direct expropriation.**? Thus, Venezuela directly expropriated Crystallex’s
investment through its rescission of the MOC and physical takeover of Las Cristinas.*”

The Claimant emphasizes that the termination was based, inter alia, on “reasons of
opportunity and convenience”*®! and that this is "an admitted unilateral taking of
contract rights, and thus a direct expropriation” °°

The Claimant further points out that Venezuela failed to comply with the minimum
requirements under Venezuelan law to exercise its prerogative to rescind contracts for
“reasons of opportunity and convenience” and that the CVG's resolution of 3 February
2011 (by which it terminated the MOC) extinguished Crystallex's rights in developing
the project without providing compensation.®?

d. The expropriation of Crystallex’s investment was unlawful

The Claimant contends that under the terms of the Treaty an expropriation can only
occur for public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and
against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*” It submits that in the present
case Venezuela violated the following three requirements (the Claimant contends that
violating either renders the expropriation wrongful):

e The expropriation was not accompanied by due process of law. According to the

Claimant, Venezuela denied Crystallex an opportunity to be heard when it dismissed
its motion for reconsideration of the denial of the Permit and when it failed to provide
an answer to Crystallex's subsequent hierarchical appeal. The Respondent further
failed to provide advance notice, a prior administrative proceeding or an opportunity
to be heard prior to the rescission of the MOC.®*® Furthermore, the rescission was
invalidly carried out by Minister Khan as a matter of Venezuelan law, for the reasons
recounted supra.*°° Thus, an expropriatory act carried out in violation of domestic
law, in these circumstances, is, in the Claimant’s view, “strongly indicative” that the
expropriation was not carried out in accordance with due process of law pursuant to
Article VII of the Treaty.**”

e The expropriation was not made against prompt, adequate and effective
compensation. Venezuela should have made an immediate offer of compensation and
it has not made such offer to date, in contravention of the Treaty 88

e Finally, the expropriation was discriminatory in light of the 2010 strategy document
by the Ministry of Mines for the development of Las Cristinas with VenRus, as well
as of the disclosed CITIC documentation.” The only justification, in the Claimant’ s
view, for choosing first a Russian and later a Chinese partner over Crystallex is to be
found in preferences based on nationality.°”° The Claimant points to the statements
by Government officials between 2008 and 2010 that Crystallex’s Canadian
nationality made it an unsuitable partner to develop Las Cristinas.°”!

2. The Respondent's Position
a. Crystallex had no rights capable of being expropriated

As a preliminary matter, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to meet
its burden to demonstrate that it had the rights it alleges were expropriated, namely, a
right under the MOC to exploit Las Cristinas, or the right to obtain a Permit. For the
Respondent, nowhere in the MOC did the CVG grant Crystallex a direct “right to
mine”, an absolute “right to exploit”, or an unconditional “right to develop” Las
Cristinas.°°? Clause 2 of the MOC, on which Crystallex relies to support its claim that
it had a right to exploit Las Cristinas, did not provide unfettered rights to exploit or

extract the Las Cristinas mineral deposit.°°

According to the Respondent, any rights to exploit that the MOC may have granted
Crystallex were conditioned upon the fulfillment of its contractual obligations, its
satisfaction of environmental regulations and obtaining the Permit from the Ministry of
Environment. With regard to the Permit, the fact that the Claimant had completed
certain steps (the Land Occupation Permit, the Feasibility Study, the Environmental
Impact Study, which Venezuela denies that the Ministry ever approved, the posting of
the Bond) in no way guaranteed that it had a right to receive the Permit.” Furthermore,
even if the Ministry of Environment approved part of Crystallex’s EIS, which the

Respondent denies, such approval would have been limited to a Permit for preliminary
works, not a full Permit for exploitation. Thus, no right to exploit could have been
created, and thus Crystallex could not have lost such right when the Permit was
denied.”

b. There was no expropriation of Crystallex’s rights

The Respondent denies that there was any direct or indirect expropriation of
Crystallex’s investment.’ More precisely, the Respondent disputes that the acts
described by Crystallex - such as the denial of the Permit, the rejection of administrative
remedies and the rescission of the MOC - are expropriatory, and submits instead that
these acts "involved the legitimate application of reasonable environmental regulations,
and a contracting party's legitimate exercise of its right to rescind under mutually agreed
upon contractual terms".?””

According to the Respondent, substantial and consistent decisions conclude that "a
government's reasonable and proportionate application of its regulatory power is not an
expropriation".*°* Further, for a state action rescinding a contract to be considered an
expropriation, the state must have deprived the claimant of its rights by acting outside
the legal framework of the contract or concession, on the basis of superior sovereign
authority (puissance publique).° The Claimant has failed to establish that the Ministry
of Environment did not act within its legitimate regulatory authority in denying the
Permit,?!° or that the contract rescission was anything other than an exercise of
commercial contractual rights.

With regard to the specific measures which Claimant argues evince an indirect (or
creeping) expropriation, the Respondent makes the following arguments:

With regard to the denial of the Permit, the Respondent observes that the Ministry of
Environment simply applied and enforced Venezuela’s environmental regulations in
existence at the time of the MOC,”"' and it was in no way pursuing a political agenda
when it denied such Permit.'? Crystallex had been notified repeatedly of (but failed
to address) the Ministry of Environment’s concerns regarding water issues, vegetation
and biodiversity, indigenous peoples, artisanal miners, as well as other matters since

at least May 2004.°!? The denial of the Permit was thus a reasoned and proportional
exercise of government regulation in light of such repeatedly expressed concerns.?!*

Crystallex was not denied administrative remedies. In fact, after it failed to obtain a
response to its hierarchical appeal with regard to the denial of the Permit (which,
under Venezuelan law, means that the appeal has to be considered denied), it had the
right to present a case before the Venezuelan administrative courts, which it did not
do. Neither did Crystallex pursue domestic court remedies available to it under the
dispute resolution provision of the MOC.?!

Similarly, the alleged threats of nationalization by Minister Sanz or President Chavez
do not support the Claimant’s expropriation claims because these are individual
statements which, according to arbitral decisions, do not amount to expropriation
unless they are made in such a way as to negate the rights concerned without any
remedy. Further, “it is an undisputed fact that neither President Chavez nor Minister
Sanz proceeded to nationalize Las Cristinas”, as it was the CVG that later rescinded
the MOC on the basis of the Claimant’s breach.°!°

Finally, the CVG’s rescission of the MOC was legitimate in response to Crystallex’s
failure to meet its contractual obligations, and thus cannot constitute an expropriation.
The MOC provided explicit grounds for contract cancellation, termination, and
rescission. Because the Claimant had ceased substantial activities at Las Cristinas for
over one year and had not begun any exploitation at Las Cristinas, the CVG had ample
grounds to rescind the MOC pursuant to Clause Twenty-Four of the MOC.°!”
Furthermore, Crystallex’s failure to comply with additional undertakings contained
in the MOC constituted additional grounds for a legitimate rescission of the MOC.°!®
Thus, Venezuela contends, a contractual party’s unilateral rescission for cause, even
if flawed, is not a treaty-based expropriation where the rescission is pursuant to the
contracting party’s contractual rights and authority rather than solely its sovereign
authority or powers.’!? Finally, according to the Respondent there can be no
expropriation based on the rescission of the MOC where Crystallex failed to pursue
any of the avenues of local redress explicitly provided for in the MOC. Citing to

Lithuania, Venezuela argues that neglect for local remedies may be a determinative
factor on the merits of an expropriation claim.°”

The Respondent also disputes Crystallex’s claim that the rescission of the MOC
constituted a direct expropriation. First, a measure cannot at the same time have
contributed to an indirect expropriation and independently qualify as direct
expropriation.”?! Also, the rescission by the CVG was a legitimate exercise of
commercial contractual rights, not a state-inspired nationalization or outright transfer
of title. Because at no point did the CVG relinquish the title for Las Cristinas to
Crystallex, the Respondent argues that there was no title to “take” back when the CVG
rescinded the MOC.” In other words, the Claimant did not have any direct rights to
the concession or any property rights to the land capable of being expropriated directly
when the project was transferred to the CVG pursuant to the rescission of the MOC.°?

c. There was no unlawful expropriation

Venezuela submits that, in the event that the Tribunal were to find any act of
expropriation or any act having an effect equivalent to expropriation, the conditions
required for an expropriation to be lawful pursuant to Article VII(1) of the Treaty are
met. It argues that the challenged acts were undertaken pursuant to a public purpose,
are not discriminatory, and comply with due process. Further, the mere failure to pay
compensation does not render an expropriation “unlawful per se”.

First, Venezuela submits that the challenged acts constitute bona fide measures adopted
in pursuance of a public purpose.*™ It argues that international tribunals afford a large
measure of deference to the sovereign determination of a public purpose.” In this case,
the national interest served by the rational exploitation of a state’s natural resources is
protected under international law.°”° Venezuela contends that to leave the exploitation
of mining resources in the hands of an entity that had proven to be incapable of
exploiting them and was in breach of other numerous obligations would be contrary to
public interest, because it would deprive the state from enjoying the benefit derived
from its natural resources. In denying the Permit, Venezuela was responding to the
environmental repercussions posed by the Claimant’s ill-planned project. Furthermore,

Venezuela’s termination of the MOC was motivated by the Claimant’s own breaches
that prevented the Government from effectively pursuing the public purpose of
exploiting the natural resources for the economic and social benefit of Venezuelans.’””
Finally, Venezuela notes that when the Claimant discussed the reasons for which it
considers the expropriation unlawful, it has not challenged the fact that the rescission
was carried out for a public purpose.°7*

Second, Venezuela denies that the challenged acts are discriminatory. For a state’s
conduct to be characterized as discriminatory, there must be no reasonable or rational
justification for the particular differential treatment of a foreign investor.°?? With
reference to the alleged involvement of CITIC in Las Cristinas after Crystallex handed
over the area, Venezuela denies such allegations. It argues that the measures were
rational in light of the evidence supporting the conclusion that the Claimant could not
be trusted to fulfill its obligations under the MOC to bring Las Cristinas into production.
Even if it were true that Venezuela had consulted with a third party after it became
evident that Crystallex was not taking seriously its obligation to provide what was
necessary to obtain the Permit, and even if Venezuela had contracted a third party to
assist with the development of Las Cristinas after the rescission of the MOC, neither of
these actions would constitute discrimination.”

Venezuela further denies that the challenged acts violated due process.”*! In this case,
judicial and administrative procedures were available to the Claimant, who had a
reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its
claims heard. It was Crystallex’s choice to abandon its rights in favor of pursuing this
arbitration.”*? Venezuela submits that the CVG provided a legitimate justification for
its administrative decisions related to the rescission of the MOC and always informed
Crystallex of its right to appeal any decisions taken by Venezuelan authorities. With
respect to the Permit, Crystallex filed a recurso de reconsideracion and a recurso
jerarquico challenging the Ministry of Environment’s decision not to issue the Permit,
but chose not to avail itself of its right to take the matter to Venezuelan administrative
courts. The Claimant also decided not to file an administrative appeal challenging the
CVG’s rescission of the MOC. Nor did the Claimant assert its right under the dispute
resolution mechanism of the MOC to present its disputes before Venezuelan courts.?*?

3. Analysis
a. Did Crystallex have rights capable of being expropriated?

The Tribunal starts its analysis on expropriation with the threshold question as to
whether the Claimant had rights capable of being expropriated. Venezuela’s argument
in this respect is that the “Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it had a right to
develop or exploit Las Cristinas capable of being expropriated”.?*°

Article VII(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:

“Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect
equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
‘expropriation’) in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a
public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner
and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such
compensation shall be based on the genuine value of the investment or return
expropriated immediately before the expropriation or at the time the
proposed expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier,
shall be payable from the date of expropriation with interest at a normal
commercial rate, shall be paid without delay and shall be effectively
realizable and freely transferable.”°*”

The ordinary meaning of this provision is clear that the Treaty prohibits the
expropriation of investors’ “investments” (and “returns”) unless effected in compliance
with certain conditions. Article I(f), in turn, defines “Investments” “for the purpose of

this Agreement’”?**—thus including its Article VII(1)—in the following terms:

“any kind of asset owned or controlled by an investor of one Contracting
Party either directly or indirectly, including through an investor of a third
State, in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the
latter’s laws, In particular, though not exclusively, ‘investment’ includes:

(i) movable and immovable property and any related property rights, such as
mortgages, liens or pledges;

(ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in
a company, business enterprise or joint venture;

 

so Counter-Memorial, para. 452 (“It is undisputed that the MOC did not grant

Crystallex property rights to Las Cristinas. Therefore, Crystallex’s expropriation argument only begins to make
sense if the MOC guaranteed it rights to exploit and operate the mine at Las Cristinas. Yet Crystallex’s claim is
fundamentally undermined by its inability to prove that it had any contractual entitlement to exploitation, or to the
Permit, without meeting its own contractual obligations and adhering to applicable Venezuelan law”.).

(iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract

(iv) goodwill;
(v) intellectual property rights;

(vi) rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic
and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract
or exploit natural resources,

but does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, not
acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or
other business purposes”.

662. The Tribunal notes that the definition of “investments” provided in the Treaty is a broad
one. It further notes that “investments” include “rights, conferred by law or under
contract, to undertake any economic and commercial activity, including any rights to
search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources”.°“° This clause makes it clear
that contractual rights qualify as investments under Article I of the Treaty.

663. Furthermore, because Article VII of the Treaty makes “investments” (together with
“returns”) the object of a possible expropriation, it ensures that contractual rights are
generally capable of being expropriated. In the Tribunal’s eyes, to conclude otherwise
would mean to disregard the natural and plain meaning of these terms.°*!

664. | Under Article 2 of the MOC, Crystallex was granted the right to “undertake all of the
investments and works necessary to reactivate and execute in its totality the Mining
Project of CRISTINA 4, CRISTINA 5, CRISTINA 6 and CRISTINA 7, design, build
the plant, operate it, process the gold for its subsequent commercialization and sale, and
return the mine and its installations to the [CVG] upon the termination of the Contract,

°° BIT, Article I(f).
° BIT, Article I(f)(vi).

°4! There is furthermore clear support in the jurisprudence that contractual rights are capable of being expropriated.
For example, in Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v. Iran, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal noted that “expropriation
by or attributable to a State of the property of an alien gives rise under international law to liability for
compensation, and this is so whether the expropriation is formal or de facto and whether the property is tangible,
such as real estate or a factory, or intangible, such as the contract rights involved in the present [c]ase” (Phillips
Petroleum Company Iran y. Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \ran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, Award No.
425-39-2, 29 June 1989, Exh. CLA-16, para. 75). In Southern Pacific Properties (SPP) v. Egypt, the ICSID tribunal
observed that “[t]here is considerable authority for the proposition that contract rights are entitled to the protection
of international law and the taking of such rights involves an obligation to make compensation therefore [sic]”
(Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Egypt, ICSD Case No. ARB/84/3, Award, 20 May 1992, Exh.
CLA-19, para. 164). Several investment treaty tribunals have similarly found that contractual rights may be capable
of being expropriated. See, e.g., Siemens A.G. v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award, 6 February 2007,
Exh. CLA-53, para. 267; Compaiiia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentina, ICSID Case

in accordance [with] article 102 of the Law of Mines”.*4? Crystallex was further

authorized by the CVG to “exploit and extract gold in the area of Cristina 4, 5, 6 and
7’ © For the Tribunal, these are rights that qualify as investments under Article 1(f)(vi)
of the BIT.

665. The Tribunal further notes that the Treaty places no limitations on the types or on the
nature of the contractual rights which are defined as investments. The MOC thus
contains investment-related rights to the benefit of Crystallex that were capable of being
expropriated.

b. Did Venezuela expropriate Crystallex’s investment?

666. — In what is a reflection of the standard for expropriation found in numerous investment
treaties, Article VII(1) of the Treaty provides, in broad terms, that “investments. ..shall
not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect equivalent
to nationalization or expropriation” °*

667.  Arbitral case law has identified several types or forms of expropriations.”> It is
generally understood that a “direct” expropriation occurs where the investor’s
investment is taken through formal transfer of title or outright seizure, whereas an
“indirect” expropriation occurs where a state’s action or series of actions result in the
investor being deprived of the enjoyment or benefit of its investment, although title to
the property or the rights remains with the original owner.”*° Furthermore, the
expression “creeping expropriation” is used to refer to a specific form of expropriation
that results from a series of measures taken over time that cumulatively have an

3 MOC, Exh. C-9, Clause 2(1).

 

°4 BIT, Article VII(1) (emphasis added).

°4 As the Tribunal in Tecmed noted with particular reference to measures “equivalent or tantamount to
expropriation”, the distinctions in this respect are not always clearly delimited. See Técnicas Medioambientales
Tecmed S.A. v. Mexico, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May a Exh. CLA-39, para. 14
(“Generally, it is understood that the term “...equivalent to expropriation. “tantamount to expropriation’
included in the Agreement and in other international treaties related to the protection of foreign investors refers to
the so-called “indirect expropriation” or “creeping expropriation”, as well as to the above-mentioned de facto
expropriation. Although these forms of expropriation do not have a clear or unequivocal definition, it is generally
understood that they materialize through actions or conduct, which do not explicitly express the purpose of
depriving one of rights or assets, but actually have that effect. This type of expropriation does not necessarily take
place gradually or stealthily —the term “creeping” refers only to a type of indirect expropriation—and may be
carried out through a single action, through a series of actions in a short period of time or through simultaneous
actions. Therefore, a difference should be made between creeping expropriation and de facto expropriation,
although they are usually included within the broader concept of “indirect expropriation” and although both
expropriation methods may take place by means of a broad number of actions that have to be examined on a case-
by-case basis to conclude if one of such expropriation methods has taken place”, internal footnotes omitted).

expropriatory effect, rather than from a single measure or group of measures that occur
at one time.

The Tribunal will start by analyzing whether Venezuela’s actions constituted an
indirect, and in particular a creeping, expropriation.

State responsibility for creeping expropriation is reflected in the concept of a composite
act, defined in Article 15(1) of the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility as follows:

“The breach of an international obligation by a State through a series of
actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful occurs when the action
or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is

sufficient to constitute the wrongful act”.°"”

As the tribunal, in Siemens v. Argentina noted:

“By definition, creeping expropriation refers to a process, to steps that
eventually have the effect of an expropriation. If the process stops before it
reaches that point, then expropriation would not occur. This does not
necessarily mean that no adverse effects would have occurred. Obviously,
each step must have an adverse effect but by itself may not be significant or
considered an illegal act. The last step in a creeping expropriation that tilts
the balance is similar to the straw that breaks the camel’s back. The preceding
straws may not have had a perceptible effect but are part of the process that
led to the break”.°48

The Tribunal agrees with the observations made by these ICSID tribunals. With those
points in mind, the Tribunal will now consider the facts of the case, although it has
already traversed that subject-matter at some length when discussing FET, and will
evaluate if Venezuela’s actions amount to a creeping expropriation.

For the purposes of its expropriation analysis, the Tribunal is able to discern three broad
groups of actions which, taken cumulatively, have made the Tribunal conclude that an
expropriation has occurred under the circumstances.

A first series of actions are the actions surrounding the denial of the Permit in April
2008. The Tribunal has already underscored the fundamental unfairness underlying the
manner in which the Claimant was treated by the Venezuelan authorities during the
process leading to such denial, which has made the Tribunal conclude that the investor

184

was unfairly and inequitably treated in violation of Article II(2) of the Treaty.4? For
the purposes of the expropriation analysis, the events surrounding the Permit denial
constitute the first step in the expropriatory process—the first tangible occurrence of
the investor’s rights and the value associated thereto being severely affected as a result
of measures attributable to Venezuela.

That being said, the Tribunal wishes to make it clear that it is not ready to consider the
Permit denial as per se amounting to an act of expropriation. This view is consistent
with the Tribunal’s earlier finding that Crystallex had no “right” to a Permit under
international law, because a state would always maintain its freedom to deny a permit
if it so decides, and under Venezuelan law the “right” was conditioned on the
Administration granting the necessary approvals.” The Tribunal is of course aware
that investor-state tribunals have on occasions found that a denial of a permit or of an
authorization critical to the investor’s investment may constitute a measure tantamount
to expropriation, as the cases of Metalclad v. Mexico”! and Tecmed v. Mexico” show.
However, it considers that, under the circumstances of this case, the actions surrounding
the permit denial should rather be considered as one series of acts which in combination
with other actions gave rise to an expropriation.

A second series of actions followed the Permit denial in April 2008 and significantly
contributed to the expropriatory process. In the subsequent months, Venezuelan
governmental officials of the highest level targeted Crystallex’s investment with
statements that resulted in a gradual devaluation of the investor’s investment, and which
paved the way for the final act, the MOC termination. Before turning to this latter act,
it is worthwhile recollecting the main events which took place between April 2008 and
February 2011.

On 19 September 2008, a few months after the Permit denial and around the time
Crystallex was still endeavoring to obtain the sought-after Permit, Venezuela’s
President Hugo Chavez announced in a public address that the intention of the
Government was to take back “big mines” in Guayana, including “‘one of the biggest in
the world”. He said:

“In Guayana for example, we are taking back big mines, and one of them is
one of the biggest in the world. And do you know what it is? It’s gold, it’s
gold!"

677. It cannot be doubted, in the Tribunal’s view, that Venezuela’s President was
specifically referring to Las Cristinas (without naming it).

678. Less than two months later, an official press release from the Ministry of Mines
announced the plan to seize Las Cristinas. The reason adduced by the Ministry of Mines
was “to boost Venezuela’s international reserves”:

“He [Minister Rodolfo Sanz] added that the Las Cristinas mine, which used
to be managed by transnational company Crystallex, is expected to begin
being exploited in 2009. He said the mine will be reclaimed and operated by
the state.

Las Cristinas is considered one of Latin America’s most important gold
deposit and one of the largest in the world. With a capacity of approximately
31 million ounces of gold, its estimated value is $35 billion.

L.]

Sanz insisted on the necessity of recovering Venezuela’s largest deposits, the
objective being to increase the production capacity of strategic minerals, such
as gold, diamond, bauxite and uranium.

The government of Venezuela representative admitted that the production
capacity of gold had increased during this year, having reached its goal of
1.5 tons of gold.

‘As a result of the financial crisis spreading worldwide, we must try to
recover our gold in order to increase our international reserves’. [...]”°**

679. The day after, on 6 November 2008, Minister of Mines Sanz informed a delegation
from the Russian Government of Venezuela’s plan to develop Las Cristinas with
Rusoro, adding that “we have to rescind our relations with [Crystallex] ...we have a

legal problem there”.°°°

680. President Chavez’s Annual Address to the Nation on 13 January 2009 could leave little
doubts as to Venezuela intentions in respect of Las Cristinas. Venezuela’s President
announced the takeover of Las Cristinas and its development through VenRus in these
terms:

“[...] this year the Venezuelan State has taken over the exploitation and
control of the gold deposits of Las Cristinas at kilometer 88 in the State of
Bolivar; one of the largest gold deposits on the American continent. Cristinas
is estimated to have approximately 35.2 million ounces of gold, that is 1,094
metric tons of estimated reserves. Of this reserve, 24.5 million ounces, or 762
tons, are classified as proven.

In this way, the Venezuelan State controls 30,000 million dollars, which is
the current estimated worth of the deposit. Currently, 30 thousand. The Las
Cristinas concessions are organized into five parts: Cristina IV, Cristina V,
Cristina VI, Cristina VII and Brisas del Cuyuni. They are under the control
of socialism, for the development of economic growth for the national
development. [...]

In mining we have created this year (2008) the mixed company VenRus, with
Russia, a Russian company and a Venezuelan company, a mixed company
for the deposits of Las Cristinas”.°**

681. Subsequently, while Crystallex was being reassured by its contractual partner, the
CVG, that the MOC remained in “full force and effect”,?*” the adverse statements from
the Government continued. Thus, on 25 April 2010, President Chavez stated in the
weekly TV show “Al6 Presidente” that:

“Tf we are going to exploit gold, we will have to nationalize all of it,
recuperate and put an end to concessions, which led to degeneration [...]”.°*

682. On 17 October 2010, the Venezuelan state news agency (Agencia Venezolana de
Noticias) reported the following words pronounced by President Chavez in direct
reference to Las Cristinas during a state visit to Belarus:

“Chavez announced the nationalization of the Las Cristinas and Las Brisas
mines. ‘Las Cristinas, this mine belongs to Venezuela and it has been handed
over to transnational companies, I announce to the world that the
revolutionary Government recuperated it, together with the Las Brisas mine.

ese mineral resources are for the Venezuelan people, not for
Th 1 for the Vi ; I tf
transnationals,’ he said.”°*?

It is clear to the Tribunal that a decision at the highest level of the Venezuelan state had
been taken to oust Crystallex from Las Cristinas, and to take the mine back in
governmental hands, with a view to developing it in collaboration with new partners.
These statements effected an incremental encroachment of the Claimant’s contractual
rights and resulted in a gradual yet significant decrease of the value of the Claimant’s
investment.

On 3 February 2011, Minister Khan, who was also President of the CVG, brought those
political announcements to their conclusion and effected, through the termination of the
MOC, the “take-over of Las Cristinas” which both Venezuela’s President and his
predecessor at the Ministry of Mines, Minister Sanz, had clearly announced throughout
the years.

The MOC rescission, which in the Tribunal’s view constitutes the third and last of the
measures or groups of measures, and which taken together constituted the creeping
expropriation suffered by Crystallex, is worth considering in some more detail.

In this respect, the Tribunal first recalls the limitation to its jurisdictional mandate,
which is to decide Treaty, and not contract, claims.” It is thus not for the Tribunal to
decide whether the MOC was duly performed, or whether it was rightly or wrongfully
terminated, and what would be the consequences of any wrongful termination. These
issues are reserved to a different contractually agreed forum.

That said, the Tribunal is not precluded from taking the circumstances concerning the
MOC’s performance and termination into account to the extent necessary to decide the
expropriation claim. As the Tribunal in Bayindir noted:

“While not a contract judge, the Tribunal must review those facts related to
contract interpretation and performance and here particularly related to the
exercise of certain contractual remedies to the extent necessary to rule on the
Treaty claim”.°*!
By taking such contractual matters into consideration, based on the extensive evidence
submitted by the Parties to this Tribunal, the Tribunal will not determine contractual
claims or exercise jurisdiction under the MOC. Any findings that this Tribunal may
make in respect of the MOC are relevant only as part of the Tribunal’s analysis of the

Claimant’s expropriation claim, and wouldnot be purported to produce any effects in
the contractual context between CVG and Claimant.?™

Quite apart from the jurisdictional issues connected with the distinction between
contract and treaty claims, and the presence of an exclusive jurisdictional clause in the
MOC, which the Tribunal has already discussed and disposed of above,’™ as a matter
of substance, it is clear that a breach of a contract by a State does not normally amount
to a violation of international law. The Parties agree on the principal tenet of such latter
proposition, though they diverge on its more concrete application and especially on the
facts of the case.

The Claimant submits that the following test should apply in respect of expropriation
under international law:

“*,.the analysis is whether the acts may be characterized as merely regulatory
or contract-related, or denote instead an unreasonable, unjust,
disproportionate or even perverse use of sovereign powers, or an open resort
to the sovereign prerogative to repudiate contracts, which indicate the
existence of an expropriation under international law. This is the
international law analysis for a finding of expropriation under the Treaty”.°**

The Respondent, on the other hand, considers the applicable test to be the following:

“For a State action rescinding a contract to be considered an expropriation —
a compensable governmental taking of property - the State must have
deprived the Claimant of its rights by acting outside the legal framework of
the contract or concession on the basis of superior sovereign authority
(puissance publique)” °°

While the two tests proposed by the Parties are not identical, the Tribunal does not find
them irreconcilable, at least in the context of their application in the present dispute. In
the Tribunal’s view, the pivotal question is whether the Respondent, in terminating the
contract, acted in the exercise of its sovereign powers (puissance publique) rather than
as an ordinary contracting party. The presence of this element allows distinguishing
between mere breaches of contracts (which would normally not give rise to
international responsibility) and acts which, while expressed as contractual, are in
reality sovereign acts which may implicate state responsibility. Differently put, the
Tribunal must objectively determine whether the purported exercise of a contractual act

962 See also Counter-Memorial, para. 434 (“although a tribunal’s goal is to determine whether a respondent violated
its commitment not to expropriate under the relevant investment treaty, it can only do so after it has understood the
precise contours of the rights and obligations of both the claimant and the contracting party under the relevant
contract”).

is evidencing the characteristics of the exercise of sovereign power and is thus to be
characterized as a sovereign act.

693. The Tribunal finds support for this approach in an established line of cases.

694. In Impregilo v. Pakistan, the tribunal noted that:

“a Host State acting as a contracting party does not ‘interfere’ with a contract;
it ‘performs’ it. If it performs the contract badly, this will not result in a
breach of the provisions of the Treaty relating to expropriation or
nationalisation, unless it be proved that the State or its emanation has gone
beyond its role as a mere party to the contract, and has exercised the specific
functions of a sovereign authority. [...]

it is the Tribunal’s view that only measures taken by Pakistan in the exercise
of its sovereign power (‘puissance publique’), and not decisions taken in the
implementation or performance of the Contracts, may be considered as
measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation.”°

695. In Siemens v. Argentina, the ICSID tribunal similarly remarked that:

“for the State to incur international responsibility it must act as such, it must
use its public authority. The actions of the State have to be based on its
‘superior governmental power’. It is not a matter of being disappointed in the
performance of the State in the execution of a contract but rather of
interference in the contract execution through governmental action.”°”

696. Other investor-state cases are to a similar effect.°
697. | With those standards in mind, the Tribunal now reviews the act through which the CVG
terminated the MOC.

The CVG effected the termination of the MOC by way of Resolution No. 003-11 of 3
February 2011, issued by Minister of Mines José Khan in his function of President of
the CVG. The Resolution recalls that “[m]ining is of an eminent public policy [...]”
and “therefore, the Administration, using its power of self-governance (potestad de
autotutela) to achieve the general interest, has the power to unilaterally rescind
contracts for reasons of opportunity and convenience (oportunidad y conveniencia)”.°°
The Resolution further recalls Clause 24 of the MOC, which contemplates the CVG’s
right to unilaterally rescind the contract.”

In the operative part of the Resolution, the CVG states its decision to unilaterally
rescind the MOC “for reasons of opportunity and convenience [...] due to the cessation
of activities for more than one (1) year, in accordance with Clause Twenty-Four of the
(Moc]”.””!

In the Tribunal’s mind, the fact that the MOC was terminated for an alleged contractual
ground, i.e. failure to perform for one year (as well as for reasons of opportunity and
convenience) does not in and of itself exclude the possibility of a treaty breach.*”?
Having reviewed the circumstances of the case, and in particular all of the acts which
throughout the years implicated several governmental organs—the Ministry of
Environment, the Ministry of Mines, the Venezuelan Presidency—as well as the CVG,
the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the true nature of the act, howsoever
expressed, was one of exercise of sovereign authority.

First, this is evident as a matter of substance. The Tribunal is convinced that the
evidence on the record clearly shows that the MOC was terminated to give effect to the
superior policy decisions dictated by the higher governmental spheres. The
governmental statements and acts recalled above evince that the Respondent had a
number of reasons for opposing Crystallex’s continued involvement in the project, from
the simple desire of regaining the mine into Venezuelan hands,”” to the plan to develop

aversion to transnationals,°”> to the intention to boost its international reserves.?”°

702. The Resolution No. 003-11 of 3 February 2011 does not refer to the Respondent’s desire
to “take back” or “reclaim” Las Cristinas and to “recover [its] gold”, and rather purports
to terminate the MOC for alleged contractual grounds (Crystallex’s cessation of
activities for over one year). There can, however, be no doubt in the Tribunal’s eyes
that this ground was not more than an appearance to use a contractual remedy rather
than to resort to a sovereign decision to regain control of the mine. The Tribunal need
only look at the CVG’s internal correspondence for evidence that such ground was non-
existent even or rather precisely in the eyes of the CVG—i.e., Crystallex’s contractual
partner who had been working with it on the ground for almost a decade.

703. As already recalled?” in an internal communication dated 28 February 2011, a few
weeks after the termination, the legal department of the CVG requested from its Vice-
President “information [...] regarding the reasons why Crystallex International
Corporation has paralyzed activities for over one (1) year [...]”.°’® The legal department
asserted that it was seeking this information “in order to support the administrative
record in question”,””? making it clear that the CVG’s legal department was lacking
such basic information. The response supplied by the Vice-President, Mr. Colmenares,
on 17 March 2011 was that Crystallex had executed all of its tasks under the MOC with
the exception of gold exploitation, as it did not have a Permit:

“[A]ccording to reports from the Liaison Office [...] Crystallex International
Corporation has completed the various tasks set forth in said Operation
Contract, with the exception of the tasks corresponding to the construction
and development stage of the exploitation phase [...] due to the fact that it
was not granted the Permit [...]”.°*°

Thus, not even the CVG officers—the ones monitoring Crystallex’s compliance with
the contract—could find evidence of the “cessation of activities” (paralizacién de
actividades) invoked in the 3 February 2011 Resolution.

In short, the termination was not due to a bona fide dispute about the Parties’ obligations
under the MOC or its performance by Crystallex. It was devised to give effect to the
Respondent’s unconcealed political agenda in respect of mining generally, and the Las
Cristinas mine in particular. The termination, for which the statements of Venezuela’s
President and Ministers provided the true rationale, was an attempt by Venezuela to
“recover the mine”, without payment of any compensation. It thus constituted the final
sovereign act which completed the expropriatory process.

This would suffice for the Tribunal’s conclusion as to expropriation under the Treaty.
The Tribunal, however, is further reinforced in its conclusion considering that, also as
a matter of Venezuelan law, the termination of the MOC cannot be viewed as anything
other than a sovereign act. First, the CVG expressly invoked its power of self-
adjudication and self-enforcement (autotutela),”*' a power that only entities acting as
an authority (and not as a contractual party) may exercise.*? Secondly, the CVG
specifically invoked reasons of “opportunity and convenience” to terminate the MOC,
which constitutes an example of an exorbitant public law prerogative deriving from
sovereign authority or ius imperium under Venezuelan law.** Finally, the termination
was effected through a “Resolution”, a formal administrative act under Venezuelan
law.284

These additional considerations confirm that the true nature of the rescission was an
exercise of sovereign authority, and not an exercise of a contractual right to unilaterally
terminate the contract.

In conclusion, the conjunction and progression of acts performed by different
governmental organs, starting from the actions surrounding the denial of the Permit,
continuing with the announcements that Venezuela would “take back” Las Cristinas,
and ending with the repudiation of the MOC, had the effect of substantially depriving
Crystallex of the economic use and enjoyment of its investment, and ultimately
rendered it entirely useless. The Tribunal thus concludes that the cumulative and

incremental effect of those measures was “equivalent to [...] expropriation” under
Article VII(1) of the Treaty.

In light of this conclusion, the Tribunal may dispense with analyzing whether the MOC
termination also constitutes a direct expropriation, as any finding in this respect would
have no impact on liability or on quantification of damages.

Finally, the Tribunal rejects one last argument put forward by Venezuela, namely that
neglect of local remedies should be viewed as a “determinative factor on the merits of
an expropriation claim”.**° Article XII(3)(b) of the Treaty requires that an investor
terminate any domestic proceedings in order to pursue its international remedies.”*’ To
read a pursuit of local remedies requirement as part of the substantive cause of action
would entail bringing in by the back door a requirement that is excluded at the front
door (i.e., an exhaustion requirement as a pre-condition to arbitration). As the Ad Hoc
Committee in Helnan v. Egypt explained, in annulling the tribunal’s finding to the
contrary effect:

“{It is an entirely different matter to impose upon an investor, as condition
‘to become an international delict for which [the Contracting State] would be
held responsible under the Treaty,’ a requirement that the decision of a
Government Minister, taken at the end of an administrative process, must in
turn be challenged in the local court. Such a decision is one for which the
State is undoubtedly responsible at international law, in the event that it
breaches the international obligations of the State. Moreover, the
characterization of such an act as unlawful under international law is not
affected by its characterization as lawful under internal law. Thus a decision
by a municipal court that the Minister’s decision was lawful (a judgment
which such a court could only reach applying its own municipal
administrative law) could not preclude the international tribunal from coming
to another conclusion applying international law”.°**

c. | Were the conditions for expropriation met?

Consistent with international standards, Article VII(1) of the Treaty provides that any
expropriation must be carried out (i) for a public purpose, (ii) under due process of law,
(iii) in a non-discriminatory manner and (iv) against prompt, adequate and effective
compensation. The Tribunal now looks at whether Venezuela’s conduct met each of
these conditions.

°86 Counter-Memorial, para. 481.

°87 See BIT, Article XII(3) (providing that “[a]n investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to

With regard to public purpose, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not challenged
Venezuela’s compliance with this condition. Venezuela, on its part, contends that
taking back Las Cristinas served the public purpose of returning the project to the
Venezuelan State so that it might find a means to fulfill Venezuela’s public policy goal
of bringing the mine into production.**? States are afforded a wide margin of
appreciation in determining whether an expropriation serves a public purpose.””° Under
the circumstances and insofar as necessary given the Parties’ position on this question,
the Tribunal accepts that Venezuela purported to pursue a public interest goal in
expropriating Crystallex’s investment.

With regard to due process, the Tribunal accepts the standard set out in this respect by
the tribunal in ADC v. Hungary, a case cited favorably by both Parties:

““due process of law’, in the expropriation context, demands an actual and
substantive legal procedure for a foreign investor to raise its claims against
the depriving actions already taken or about to be taken against it. Some basic
legal mechanisms, such as reasonable advance notice, a fair hearing and an
unbiased and impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in dispute, are
expected to be readily available and accessible to the investor to make such
legal procedure meaningful. In general, the legal procedure must be of a
nature to grant an affected investor a reasonable chance within a reasonable
time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard. If no legal
procedure of such nature exists at all, the argument that ‘the actions are taken
under due process of law’ rings hollow”.”'

Measured against this standard, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not sufficiently
established that the expropriation was carried out in disrespect of due process standards.
As already noted when discussing the due process allegations under FET, to which the
Tribunal refers,?”? while the Tribunal is not insensitive to the Claimant’s dissatisfaction
with the ruling on the motion for reconsideration in respect of the Permit denial and
with the Ministry’s failure to render a decision on the hierarchical appeal, it is the
Tribunal’s view, especially in light of the experts’ testimonies, that the Claimant did
not sufficiently establish a due process violation in relation to the course of events
relating to the motion for reconsideration and the failure to render a decision on the
hierarchical appeal. Similarly, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not been
able to sufficiently establish that due process was violated because no prior

discrimination under FET which it considers relevant, mutatis mutandis, for its
examination of the fulfilment of this particular requirement under expropriation.°” The
Tribunal recalls that to show discrimination the investor must prove that it was
subjected to different treatment in similar circumstances without reasonable
justification,”* typically on the basis of its nationality or similar characteristics. When
examining discrimination under FET, the Tribunal has already elaborated on the lack
of sufficiently appropriate comparators to support a finding of discrimination in this
case. While the Tribunal has not overlooked the repeated and rather derogatory
references to “transnationals” and “transnational companies” in the President’s and the
Ministers’ statements,’ it is not satisfied that there are conclusive elements in the
record which would support the conclusion that the expropriation was carried out in a
discriminatory manner.

716. Finally, pursuant to Article VII(1) of the Treaty, expropriation must be accompanied
by “prompt, adequate and effective compensation”. It is undisputed that no such
compensation was either paid or offered to Crystallex. When a treaty cumulatively
requires several conditions for a lawful expropriation, arbitral tribunals seem uniformly
to hold that failure of any one of those conditions entails a breach of the expropriation
provision.*”°

VIII. REPARATION

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

According to the Claimant, restitution has become “impossible” after Venezuela
granted rights in relation to Las Cristinas to CITIC. Therefore, the Claimant seeks
damages as of 3 February 2011 for the Las Cristinas project in the amount of its alleged
fair market value of US$3.16 billion based on the average of results from four valuation
methodologies. The Claimant further asks the Tribunal to (i) award pre- and post-award
interest at the rate of 8% per annum compounded semi-annually, (ii) declare that the
award of damages and interest is net of applicable Venezuelan taxes and that Venezuela
may not deduct taxes, (iii) order Venezuela to indemnify the Claimant in respect of any
double taxation liability in Canada or elsewhere, and (iv) order Venezuela to pay all
the costs and expenses of this arbitration.

The Respondent submits that (i) restitution is not an available remedy in this case; (ii)
the BIT’s standard of compensation — and not customary international law — is the
controlling legal standard; (iii) the Claimant is not entitled to damages other than the
fair market value assessed at the time of the alleged taking; (iv) the Claimant is not
entitled to damages because (a) the alleged damages are “highly speculative, if not
entirely fictional”; (b) the valuation methods put forward by Claimant are inappropriate
in the circumstances and contrary to international arbitral practice; and (c) the Claimant
has failed to establish any causal link between the alleged wrongful acts and the
requested damages. Finally, the Respondent argues that the Claimant is not entitled to
compound interest or tax indemnity.

RESTITUTION

1. The Claimant’s Position

Until the Hearing, the primary remedy sought by the Claimant was restitution of its
investment through the re-establishment of the MOC according to its terms and through
the grant of the Permit, together with any consequent damages as a consequence of not
granting the Permit earlier.’ The Claimant had invoked Article XII(9) of the BIT,
which reads as follows:

“A Tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:

(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest;

°87 See Memorial, paras 392-397, 495; Reply, paras 585-590, 751.

198

723.

724.

725.

(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the
disputing Contracting Party may pay monetary damages and applicable
interest in lieu of restitution [...]”.

For the Claimant, the principle governing recovery from injury for internationally
wrongful acts is that of “full reparation”.** Pursuant to the Chorzéw Factory ruling by
the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) and the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, a state’s first obligation to remedy an international wrongful act is to
make restitution.?” Echoing the ILC Articles and arbitral decisions, the Claimant had
submitted that restitution should be ordered, provided it was not materially impossible
and did not result in a burden out of proportion as compared to compensation. !0

At the hearing, the Claimant stated that:

“Until recently, restitution seemed like a possibility here. However, it
appears that the CITIC transaction has rendered restitution impossible and,
therefore, I'm going to focus the remainder of my presentation on the Fair
Market Value.”!!

In reply to a question from the Tribunal as to whether the Claimant had withdrawn its
claim for restitution,!°°? the Claimant clarified that it had not withdrawn such claim per
se, but rather indicated that restitution has become impossible after the Venezuelan
Government entered into agreements with a third party, CITIC, granting it rights to Las
Cristinas.!° As a result, the Claimant contends, “the parties have agreed that the
Claimant’s restitution claim is now moot”.!° Accordingly, the Claimant’s request for
relief as expressed in its post-hearing submission and its supplemental submission on
quantum of 12 September 2014 (hereinafter, “C-Supplemental Quantum Submission”)
no longer includes restitution.!°

2. The Respondent’s Position

In its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, Venezuela argued that restitution is not an
appropriate remedy in this case. First, the Respondent noted that restitution is not
available for expropriation, because Article VII of the BIT on expropriation clearly

refers only to monetary compensation (through the use of the terms “payable”,
“interest”, “paid” and “effectively realizable and freely transferable”).!°°° Furthermore,
even in circumstances where restitution is awarded, Article XII(9) of the BIT allows a

Contracting Party to pay monetary damages rather than make restitution of property.!°°”

According to the Respondent, arbitral decisions show that restitution is rarely awarded,
especially in cases involving natural resources, concessions and related contracts.!°*
In the context of Las Cristinas, the Respondent submits that such a remedy would imply
the re-establishment of a contractual relationship that had been terminated for lack of
activity on the part of the Claimant for more than a year and the granting of an
environmental Permit for a project “fraught with technical deficiencies and unmitigated
social and environmental repercussions”.!° The Respondent also contends that an
award for restitution would constitute a reparation wholly disproportional to its
interference with Venezuela’s sovereignty when compared to monetary
compensation. !°!?

In its post-hearing submission, the Respondent notes that at the hearing the Claimant
explicitly withdrew its claim for restitution.!°"!

3. Analysis

There is no need to further discuss the restitution claim, as both Parties, out of different
considerations, reject it.

MONETARY COMPENSATION

With regard to monetary compensation, the Tribunal sets out first the positions of the
Parties as to the relevant issues (Section 1), followed by its Analysis (Section 2).

1. The Positions of the Parties
a. The standard of compensation
i. The Claimant’s Position
(a) Fair market value

730. | The Claimant submits that it is entitled to monetary damages and any applicable interest
on the basis of compensation principles established under customary international
law, 1012

731. For the Claimant, the compensation standard listed under Article VII(1) of the Treaty
applies only to lawful expropriations, i.e. expropriations that are carried out in
accordance with all of the conditions for legality (public purpose, due process, non-
discrimination, and the timely payment of appropriate compensation).!°'? With regard
to unlawful expropriations and other Treaty breaches (such as violations of the FET and
FPS standards), the Claimant contends that “the Treaty provides no compensation
formula or a lex specialis (or requirement for an expropriation date) [...]”.!°!4 In these
circumstances, tribunals must look to customary international law for the applicable
standard of reparation and apply the Chorzéw Factory principle of “full reparation” .!°'>
This means placing Crystallex in the economic position it would have been had the
wrongful acts never occurred.'°'° For the Claimant, the quantum of compensation owed
to Crystallex for Venezuela’s Treaty breaches other than expropriation is identical to
that which would be owed under an unlawful expropriation theory, because the
destructive consequence of Venezuela’s unlawful acts for Crystallex’s investment were
the same (regardless of their characterization as one or another form of Treaty
breach).!°!7

732. To achieve full reparation, monetary compensation should, Crystallex claims, be
assessed according to the “fair market value” of its investment.'°!* In any event, the
Claimant contends that “genuine value” pursuant to Article VII(1), which the Claimant
submits applies only to lawful expropriations, is synonymous with fair market value.!°!?

736.

The Claimant argues that when an investment is characterized by reasonably
contemplating certain prospects of profitability, as was the case with Crystallex’s
investment in the Las Cristinas gold deposit, international law requires that the fair
market value of the investment take into account such future prospects.!°”° At the time
of Venezuela’s measures, Crystallex was poised to begin construction at Las Cristinas,
to be followed by production a short time thereafter.'°*! Furthermore, the Claimant
argues that predicting future income from ascertained reserves to be extracted by the
use of traditional mining techniques, as is the case of Las Cristinas, can be done with a
significant degree of certainty, even without a record of past production. !°72

(b) Valuation date

With regard to the valuation date, the Claimant submits that 3 February 2011, i-e., the
date of the rescission of the MOC, is the appropriate valuation date since it coincides
with the final expropriation of its investment and also with the moment when Crystallex
was no longer required to fund the asset.'°?

On the contrary, 13 April 2008, i.e. the date of denial of the Permit, would be an
inappropriate valuation date, because at this point in time the act of taking was not
irreversible; indeed, Venezuela indicated between April 2008 and February 2011 that
the MOC was in full force and that the Permit could still be obtained, whereas the taking
became irreversible on 3 February 2011 with the rescission of the MOC.'4 For the
Claimant, an April 2008 valuation date would allow Venezuela to escape its obligation
to make “full reparation” for its wrongful conduct and instead to benefit from that
conduct. !?5

For the Claimant, valuing Crystallex’s investment as of April 2008 would deprive
Crystallex of the fair market value of its expropriated investments on the date of the
taking and of the benefit of its economic foresight (i.e., having predicted at the time it
began investment that the price of gold would rise), while improperly rewarding
Venezuela for its unlawful conduct by permitting it to take advantage of the increase in
the value of Crystallex’s investment that occurred between April 2008 and the
culmination of Venezuela’s expropriation in February 2011.!°7°

740.

However, even if the Tribunal were to find that Venezuela’s expropriation occurred in
April 2008, in the Claimant’s view, compensation should still be awarded based on a
valuation date of February 2011. This is because the expropriation by Venezuela was
not conducted lawfully under the parameters established under the Treaty, but
constituted an unlawful expropriation in breach of Venezuela’s Treaty obligations and
customary international law, which requires Crystallex to be compensated as of the
valuation date that most closely affords it full reparation.!°7”

Finally, the Claimant notes that, if the Tribunal were to adopt an April 2008 valuation
date, it would need to order separate compensation for the significant additional costs
incurred by Crystallex after April 2008, in connection with its work on the Las Cristinas
Project. These expenses would not have been incurred if Venezuela had actually
provided Crystallex with prompt and effective compensation for the expropriation at
that time. These “consequential damages” amount to approximately US$ 180
million. !078

(c) Burden of proof and causation

As to the burden of proof, the Claimant accepts that it has to prove the damage suffered
from Venezuela’s wrongful acts, but contends that the standard of proof is one of a
balance of probabilities, i.e., it is enough for the tribunal to be able to admit with
sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage.'”? The Claimant further
accepts that it has to prove causation. It submits that there must be a “sufficient causal
link” between the cause and effect, such that the breach was “the proximate cause of
the harm”.!°°° The Claimant argues that it has established that Venezuela’s measures
not only caused a reduction in the value of its investment, but they destroyed the entirety
of that investment. !°3!

The Claimant further notes in respect of causation that (i) Crystallex had obtained
financing for the exploration phase; (ii) Las Cristinas had proven and probable gold
resources and reserves; and (iii) Crystallex has a proven track record of operating gold
mines in Venezuela.'°* Thus, there is nothing speculative about the damage suffered
by Crystallex.!*? In addition, the Claimant argues that the issuance of the Permit would

have facilitated Crystallex's ability to secure further financing,!°* and that on 11

February 2008, only two months before Crystallex was denied the Permit, Crystallex
had been able to raise CDN$69.1 million (approximately US$ 69.0 million) through
equity financing, providing sufficient cash to begin construction of the Las Cristinas
plant and site and to proceed with the development of the mine.!°>

In any event, even if, arguendo, Crystallex could not have financed the development of
Las Cristinas (which the Claimant denies),'°*° the company-specific shortcoming of the
owner of those rights would be irrelevant to the Fair Market Value of the rights, held
by Crystallex in the MOC.'°37

In this respect, Crystallex submits that the quantum issue before the Tribunal is not
Crystallex’s ability to develop and operate Las Cristinas. Rather, the relevant inquiry is
what price Crystallex would have obtained for its right to exploit Las Cristinas in an at
arm’s length sale.!°* This is because Fair Market Value is an impersonal detached
measure, reflecting the “consensus of the market” as to the value of a particular right
or asset, rather than the unique circumstances of a particular holder of a right or
asset. 10?

ii. The Respondent’s position
(a) The BIT’s standard of compensation

Venezuela contends that, if the Respondent’s liability under the BIT is established
(which it denies), the standard of compensation provided by Article VII of the BIT
controls the computation of monetary damages. For the Respondent, the customary
international law principle of “full reparation” has developed in the sphere of inter-state
relations and is inapplicable in investor-state arbitration.'!“*° The Respondent relies on
a passage in Chorzow to argue that the scope of the obligation of reparation differs
depending on whether an alleged breach concerns the rights of a sovereign state or the
rights of a private entity.'°4! Venezuela finds further support in the ILC Articles on
State Responsibility, which, it contends, carve out obligations owed to entities other
than states.“ While Venezuela maintains that the ILC Draft Articles on State

Responsibility are not appropriate in the context of this investor-state dispute, it refers

to them in its written pleadings “to the extent that they may be used as guidance”.!°4

For the Respondent, Article VII(1) of the BIT makes no distinction between lawful and
unlawful expropriations, but only refers to measures depriving investors of their
property. Thus, the plain meaning of “compensation” coupled with the absence of a
distinction between legal and illegal deprivation measures should be given its natural
effect, and, consequently, the treaty-based compensation should be applied to any
conduct resulting in a deprivation of rights as long as it is established under the BIT.!°#
The standard of compensation provided by a treaty is /ex specialis superseding the lex
generalis of customary international law.!°5

For the Respondent, the Parties’ disagreement over the applicable standard of
reparation is ultimately “largely irrelevant”, because the Claimant agrees that monetary
damages must be assessed by reference to the fair market value of its investment at the
time of the alleged deprivation, which is consistent with Article VII(1) of the BIT.!°
Venezuela suggests that the only implication from the customary international law
standard that the Claimant appears to draw is (i) that a date of valuation other than the
date of the alleged deprivation be applicable, and (ii) that the award include compound
interest and a tax indemnity.!”

(b) Valuation date

Venezuela submits that the valuation date should be 13 April 2008 (i.e., the day before
the denial of the Permit), and not 3 February 201 1.1048 Only the first date is, in the
Respondent’s view, consistent with the terms of Article VII of the BIT (setting the date
of valuation “immediately before the expropriation or at the time the proposed
expropriation became public knowledge”) and international arbitral practice.!?
Because the date on which an investment must be valued is the date when the investor
has been deprived of his fundamental rights of ownership, irrespective of whether legal
title is affected, 14 April 2008 is the date on which the alleged deprivation occurred.!°°

By contrast, the Claimant’s choice of 3 February 2011 allows it to choose a higher spot
price and to increase the amount of economically extractable gold contained in the

ore. 105!

The Respondent further notes that in 2008 the Claimant clearly saw the denial of the
Permit as constituting a potential dispute under the Treaty, as shown by its 24
November 2008 Notice of Dispute.'°* As a consequence, the Claimant cannot seriously
claim that its alleged “right to mine” only became affected two years later.'°°? Even
assuming arguendo that additional discussions may have occurred with Crystallex after
that date, the fact remains that its investment in Las Cristinas was negatively impacted
with the denial of the Permit and this would have been considered by a hypothetical
buyer of Crystallex’s alleged rights.!"4

On the so-called “consequential damages” amounting to US$ 180 million, to which the
Claimant argues that it is entitled,!° the Respondent submits that this theory is
completely new and has never been presented before in this arbitration. Furthermore,
this new category of damages has not been independently assessed by the Claimant’s
damages experts and includes inappropriate and unjustified costs. Moreover, the
Claimant has not shown that these costs are attributable to Venezuela’s alleged
conduct.!6

(c) Burden of proof and causation

The Respondent disputes the Claimant's position that the standard of proof for damages
is the “balance of probabilities”.'°°’ For the Respondent, future losses must rather be
proven with “sufficient certainty”,!°® as damages claims that resort to mere

probabilities, uncertainties, and guess work cannot be recovered. !°%?

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the Claimant failed to establish the
requirement of causation, namely a causal link between Venezuela's conduct and the

assume that any outside party would not be negatively influenced by the fact that the Environmental Permit had
been denied almost three years earlier”).

alleged loss sustained and future profits.'° As further detailed below, for the
Respondent the claimed damages in this case are too remote and inherently
speculative.!°°! In particular, the Claimant’s future profits are premised on many
unfulfilled and unfounded assumptions and take no account of the host of uncertainties
and risks which were prevalent in the Las Cristinas project.!° Venezuela posits that
the unsubstantiated assumptions destroy the causality between the alleged breaches and
the loss of the alleged future profits.!°°

b. Calculation of fair market value
i. The Claimant’s position

According to the Claimant, the key factors to arrive at an accurate estimate of the value
of a gold mine are (i) the size of the deposit and the reserves it holds; (ii) the effect of
gold prices on reserves and resources; and (iii) the ease and cost of extraction.!°

With regard to the size of the deposit, the Claimant argues that, by hiring Mine
Developing Associates (MDA) and investing in a complex process of drilling and
testing between 2003 and 2007, Crystallex succeeded in increasing proven and probable
reserves at Las Cristinas by 77% relative to the proved and probable reserves known at
the time Crystallex assumed control in 2002.'°° In particular, the Claimant submits that
the “MDA 2007 Technical Report” confirmed that Las Cristinas had proven and
probable reserves estimated at 16.86 million ounces of gold in situ.!°

With regard to the effect of gold prices, the Claimant submits that a prospective buyer
would have to update the MDA figures for 2007 (an amount of gold based on a gold
price of US$ 550 per ounce) by applying the higher price prevailing on 3 February
2011, ie. US$ 1,328 per ounce.!°® In this respect, the Claimant argues that its expert,
Mr. Ellis, was instructed to prepare such a reserve update and that “[u]sing a cut off
grade of 0.31 grams per tonne, Mr. Ellis calculated that the proven and probable
reserves at Las Cristinas had increased to 23.6 million ounce of gold in situ at the
Valuation Date” [i.e., 3 February 201 1].!°%

With regard to the ease and cost of extraction, the Claimant submits that Las Cristinas
was free from cost-intensive problems insofar as the site was located off a paved
highway, that it was close to an electrical substation and that the local population
favored the project and included some experienced mine workers.!° In addition, Las
Cristinas did not present significant geological complexities that would have
complicated the process of removing ore from the ground, and the planned mine
followed a simple open pit model.!°” Besides, the Claimant points out that it invested
significantly in making the project "shovel ready", namely building access roads, an
airstrip, living quarters and other facilities for constructions staff, and clearing the site
of illegal miners.!07!

 

Thus, the Claimant concludes that “‘a prospective buyer seeking to assess the fair market
value of the right to mine Las Cristinas would have been able to determine with a high
degree of certainty the amount of gold ore in the Las Cristinas deposit, the amount of
gold that could economically be extracted at current gold prices, the cost of building a
processing plant and the cost of operating such a plant. The income stream that would
derive from Las Cristinas could confidently be predicted. This would have been the
case even before a gold processing plant was built at the site”.!°”

The Claimant also submits that the very large deposit at Las Cristinas has "premium
value" because of its potential for further discoveries'®’’ and that its reserve for future
production would allow Las Cristinas to have "significant strategic value" even if gold
prices were to fall.!°"

The Claimant’s experts have been instructed to estimate the investment’s value on the
valuation date of 3 February 2011,'°”> and based on the following assumptions:

ii. The Respondent’s position
(a) The Claimant's damages claims are speculative and unsupported

758. For the Respondent, it is a settled rule of international law that no compensation can be
awarded for speculative damages, including lost profits.'*° It cites to Article 36(2) of
the ILC Articles to the effect that “the compensation shall cover any financially
assessable damages including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (emphasis
added). Venezuela contends that international courts and tribunals have approached
with great caution the ability of a claimant to establish lost profits with a reasonable
degree of certainty in face of no history of operations, earnings or profits.!°*!

759. The Respondent argues that Crystallex never constructed the mine at Las Cristinas or
brought it to operation.!°*? Crystallex was still at a pre-feasibility stage for certain costs,
financial and engineering and design aspects,!°* and its EIS had proven to be clearly
deficient.!°** Even if the Claimant had established that it could have begun production

07 Memorial, para. 429.

 

1078 Memorial, paras 431-432. Mr. Ellis was given an alternative assumption that a prospective buyer of Crystallex’s
rights would not be constrained by Crystallex’s financing limitation and could operate the processing plan at an
optimum production rate of 140,000 tpd. The Claimant has referred to this as the “Unconstrained Scenario”.

agreement of the Parties, said extensions shall be notified prior to the term of the Contract” [sic]). The Claimant’s
experts also made calculations on the basis of the initial contract period stated in the MOC (20 years) with no
extensions (Memorial, para. 433).

at Las Cristinas, the Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot recover lost profits
based on cash flow projections far into the future.!°%

For the Respondent, it is egregious that the Claimant has refused to provide the Tribunal
with any alternative damages calculation other than its inflated calculations as of 3
February 2011, or to examine any alternative methodology other than its four proposed
valuation approaches.!°8°

Venezuela contends that, if the Tribunal were to find Venezuela liable under the
Canada-Venezuela BIT, the Tribunal should find that the Claimant has failed to meet
its burden of proving and substantiating the quantum of its injuries.'°°7

(b) The Claimant relies on erroneous assumptions

The Respondent argues that the amount of damages claimed by Crystallex are derived
from erroneous assumptions. In particular, Venezuela disputes that the size of the Las
Cristinas deposit is known, because Crystallex conducted only limited drilling work
and, in addition, MDA's estimates of tonnes and grades at Las Cristinas are unlikely to
be accurate.'8§ The Respondent also submits that Crystallex opportunistically selected
the spot price for gold as of 3 February 2011 (US$ 1,328) instead of the price at the
time of the 2007 Technical Report (US$ 550), with a view to inflating the damages
calculations.'°*? Venezuela further disputes that the site was in a "shovel ready" state,
and points to a number of unresolved problems and concerns.!°”° The assumption that
the project would be attractive to large mining companies and others because, inter alia,
of its size and potential for future discoveries of resources, is similarly unfounded given
the history of the Las Cristinas project (whereby Crystallex was unable to meet its
obligations and its previous operator, Placer Dome, abandoned the project) and the
inability of Crystallex to attract a partner to develop Las Cristinas.'?!

Venezuela objects to the further assumptions used by the Claimant, and submits the
following:

. As already mentioned, the valuation date should be 13 April 2008 (i.e., the day
before the denial of the Permit), and not 3 February 201 1.1092

. Crystallex was not entitled to the Permit. The Claimant’s experts have ignored
the environmental risks posed by the Las Cristinas project during its various
phases and have accepted the Claimant’s instructions without any meaningful
verification.!0

. The assumption that a larger miner would buy the project is likewise erroneous.
For the Respondent the assumptions about the level of return the “willing
buyer” would be willing to accept are at odds with both valuation and damages
theories.!°"* In addition, these assumptions are contrary to Clause 20 of the
MOC, which prohibits the assignment of rights.!

. The spot price of gold on 3 February 2011, as opposed to a historical 3-year
average price, is inappropriate. The Respondent contends that regulators,
particularly the SEC, recommend using the average price of gold during the
trailing three years from the valuation date.!°°° The Respondent favors the use
of either a consensus long-term gold price of US$650 (on 13 April 2008) or a
three-year historical average price of US$629 (on the same date).

. Unlike what the Claimant contends, Crystallex’s technical studies were neither
at feasibility level nor bankable. Rather, a reasonable third-party investor would
understand that a complete feasibility study would have to be completed, at a
cost, before any proper valuation could be conducted.!°”

. The assumption that Crystallex would be able to obtain financing in mid-2008
to begin the construction of Las Cristinas is erroneous.!

. The assumption that Crystallex would have immediately begun development,
construction and production at Las Cristinas once the Permit was granted is also
faulty.!°°

e Finally, the Respondent submits that the assumption that the MOC would be
extended for an additional 20 years for a total of 40 years is “perhaps the most
counterfactual assumption”, and cites to communications from the CVG to the
effect that the mine life was expected to conform to the shorter 20-year initial
term of the MOC.!!0°

c. The valuation methodologies
i. Overview

764. | The Claimant’s experts have used four different valuation methodologies. In particular,
the Compass Lexecon reports prepared by Messrs. Abdala and Spiller have applied
three methodologies:

e An income based approach that assesses the Net Asset Value (NAV) for the
Las Cristinas project and that is adjusted by reference to the NAV of other gold
mining companies, with a figure amounting to US$ 2,813 million;!!!

e A relative market multiple approach that uses a number of comparable gold
mining companies and “market multiples”, with a figure amounting to US$
2,749 million;!!°? and

e A stock market study approach that seeks to assess the damage to the value of
the company's stock price by reference to the evolution of stock prices for other
gold mining companies, with a figure amounting to US$ 2,833 million.!!

765. The Claimant has also submitted two reports prepared by Mr. Trevor Ellis. These
reports have used a "market transaction valuation” method (also known as indirect sales
comparison), which is a variation of the market-based comparable approach adopted
by Compass Lexecon in its relative market multiple valuation, with figures, inter alia,
of US$ 4.25 billion under a production rate of 40,000 tpd for 40 years and US$5.9
billion under a production rate of 140,000 tpd.!!*

766. According to the Claimant, the use of these four methodologies enables to produce “a
consistent assessment of the fair market value of Crystallex's rights in Las

1100 Rejoinder, para. 580. See also First ER Hart, paras 110-111 (arguing that “[g]iven the variety of risks associated
with a mining project and the unknown economic terms of any contract extension, the MOC extension is by no
means reasonably certain [...]”).

Cristinas”.!'°5 On the contrary, the use of a “cost approach methodology” (as
propounded by Venezuela) would not produce estimates of fair market value,''!®° and
would be inappropriate for the valuation of Las Cristinas, which has proven reserves
and resources, as well as cash flows that can be reasonably estimated from those proven
reserves and resources.'!°’ Thus, under those circumstances, Las Cristinas must be
valued according to income-based and market-based approaches.!!%

In response to the Claimant’s expert reports, Venezuela submitted two expert reports
by Timothy H. Hart dated 21 November 2012 (the “First Hart Report”) and 17
September 2013 (the “Second Hart Report”). The Respondent and its expert contend
that, in addition to applying faulty assumptions, the Claimant’s damages experts have
inappropriately applied each of the methodologies to reach inflated calculations.!!”

In addition to arguing that each of the four methodologies proposed by the Claimant is
in itself faulty, in its Supplemental Quantum Submission the Respondent notes that the
“completely discredited” Market Transaction method (proposed by Mr. Ellis) provided
the assumptions that continue to form the basis for the P/NAV and Relative Market
Multiples methodologies put forth by Abdala and Spiller in response to the Tribunal’s
25 July 2014 Questions, thereby undermining their validity.!!!°

The Respondent contends that the only appropriate method to value Crystallex’s
interest in Las Cristinas is a cost approach, because Las Cristinas was a late exploration
/ early evaluation and design stage project, with uncertain future cash streams.
However, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to put forward a cost
claim or any of the necessary supporting details to arrive at a precise figure.

The following paragraphs summarize in greater detail the positions of the Parties on the
different valuation methodologies.

ii. The Net Asset Value (NAV) approach
(a) The Claimant's position

The Claimant and its experts contend that the NAV approach is widely used in the
mining industry and consists of the calculation of net present value of future cash flows
and adjusts those cash flows to account for risk.!!!!

775.

The Claimant distinguishes the NAV approach from a traditional DCF analysis, in
which future cash flows are discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC).!!!? In the Claimant’s view, the WACC, which is the critical component used
to measure industry risk in a traditional DCF analysis, is not a reliable indicator of the
industry risks that affect gold mining companies because, unlike almost every other
industry, gold companies are not affected by typical market cycles given the unique
economics of their product, which behaves as both a commodity and a safe haven.!!!3
Thus, instead of using a WACC, the NAV method incorporates industry-specific risk
through the P/NAV (price to Net Asset Value) multiple.!!!4

To arrive at a NAV for the Las Cristinas project, Compass Lexecon first calculated
project revenue by calculating projected gold production over 40 years and multiplying
this by the spot price of gold on the 3 February 2011 valuation date (i.e., US$1,328 per
ounce). From this figure, capital costs, operating costs and income taxes, royalties and
other taxes were deducted.'!!> The second step multiplies the NAV of the Las Cristinas
site by the Price/NAV Ratio (P/NAV). This ratio compares the market capitalization of
publically traded companies engaged in gold mining in developing countries to the net
present value of cash flows, discounted at a uniform rate of 5%. The purpose of this
step is to account for industry-specific risk.'!!®

The Claimant submits that to calculate a net project revenue for the Las Cristinas mine,
a record of production for the Las Cristinas mine is not necessary. Because “gold is a
unique commodity”,!!!” future cash flows of a gold company — including one at an early
stage of development — are significantly more definite than for most companies that are
more mature but sell products that are subject to the whims of market demand,
innovation and local politics and economies.!!'§ Thus, the traditional difficulties of
estimating the future cash flows for a company with no historical record do not apply
to the gold mining industry.!!!°

With regard to the main variable in future income, gold price fluctuations, an
assumption was made that the constant gold price throughout the project would be the
spot price on the date of valuation. The use of a spot price is reflected in the practice of
the gold industry with respect to capital investment planning and the valuation of
mining companies, unlike an use of a backward-looking forecast (such as the

application of a trailing three-year average price of gold, as propounded by the
Respondent).!!° For the Claimant, there is no evidence on record that the historical
prices proposed by Venezuela are ever used by market participants for fair market value
transactions (as opposed to regulatory reporting of reserves).!!7!

Further, a yearly discount rate of 5% was applied to the projected annual cash flows.!!72
The use of a 5% real discount rate is appropriate, because the country-risk and
production-stage adjustments take place through the P/NAV adjustment.!!7>

By this approach, the Claimant’s experts have estimated damages as of 3 February 2011
at US$ 2.81 billion based on a 40-year operational horizon.!!74

The Claimant provided further figures in relation to a 2011 valuation date and certain
sensitivities requested by the Tribunal in its 4 March 2014 Questions.!!75

In its 25 July 2015 Questions, the Tribunal asked the following question:

“To supply the necessary data and the calculations in relation to the P/NAV
method, assuming:

(i) The date of valuation is 13 April 2008;

(ii) The price of gold is (a) $629, or (b) $650, or (c) $925;

(iii) The duration is (a) 20 years or (b) 40 years;

(iv) The extraction rate is 20,000 tpd moving to 40,000 tpd in year 3; and

(v) The implied nominal discount rate is (a) 10.41%, or (b) 12.71%, or (c)
15%, or (d) 17%, or (e) 22%."

The Claimant provided calculations in response to the Tribunal’s question.!!2” While
reiterating that in the P/NAV valuation method nominal discount rates are not used,!!28

Reply, paras 662-668. By contrast, the Claimant submits that if one were to apply a conventional DCF analysis

(by adjusting for cash flows to be in nominal terms, by using forward-looking gold prices, and by not allowing for
an additional adjustment via the P/NAV ratio) the nominal discount rate in line with the P/NAV approach taken by
Compass Lexecon as of February 2011 using data from emerging (developing) markets would actually be 10.41%.

in order to employ alternative implied nominal discount rates within the P/NAV
method, as requested by the Tribunal, the Claimant’s experts generated hypothetical
(but, in the Claimant’s view, counterfactual) P/NAV multiples consistent with the
implied nominal discount rates requested through the same reverse process. In other
words, in these alternative valuations, the experts first conducted a DCF-style
calculation, which the Claimant contends is inappropriate for a gold project but allows
use of the implied nominal discount rates requested by the Tribunal, and then found the
P/NAV multiple that yielded the same numerical result as the results produced using
the implied nominal discount rates stipulated by the Tribunal.!!??

The Claimant contends that the P/NAV multiple used in Crystallex’s original P/INAV
valuation can be compared to a 10.41% discount rate applicable in a traditional DCF
analysis.''*° However, applying higher discount rates to the value of the right to mine
Las Cristinas is wholly inconsistent with the real world transactions concerning the
right to mine gold in Venezuela.!'*!

The Claimant and its experts have argued that at the implied nominal discount rates and
gold prices requested by the Tribunal in its 25 July 2014 Questions, the value
assessment under the P/NAV method is the same under the 20-year or 40-year

scenario, |!

Also in this case, the Claimant contends that the so-called consequential damages in the
amount of US$ 180 million should be added.!!5

(b) The Respondent's position

The Respondent submits that the NAV methodology used by the Claimant and its
experts artificially inflates the value of Las Cristinas.''*4 For the Respondent, a valuator
can only predict future earnings with reasonable certainty based on past earnings. In
this case, Las Cristinas had no past performance and never turned a profit.'!> The NAV
method requires numerous assumptions about a company’s projected future revenues,
gold prices, and size of reserves, and fails to properly take into account its risks (e.g.,
technical, environmental and geopolitical). Because of the number and nature of
assumptions that must be made when there is no past performance, or when no current

operations exist, or when it is uncertain when or whether operations will start, the NAV
approach is inherently unreliable.!'*°

In any event, Mr. Hart does not accept Compass Lexecon’s use of (i) a 5% discount
rate, recommending instead the use of a 22% discount rate, which would account for
the higher level of risk associated with projects in South America;''*’ and (ii) the 3
February 2011 spot price of US$ 1,328 per ounce of gold, recommending instead the
use of a 3-year trailing average as per the SEC Guidelines from a valuation date of 13
April 2008.''** The Respondent further notes that it is unrealistic to assume that gold
prices will remain constant for 40 years.!!9°

In the Respondent’s view, the P/NAV method is flawed for a number of additional
reasons. First, the (P) multiple is derived from a restricted sample of only 20 companies,
and there is significant variance between the lowest and highest multiples of the
allegedly comparable companies.''*° Furthermore, the NAV of Crystallex is based on
Mr. Ellis’ aggressive extraction and production scenario (80,000 tpd) that never existed
in any of the contemporaneous studies prepared by SNC-Lavalin and MDA."'4!

More generally, the Respondent contends that the P/NAV is not an income approach
(as the Claimant’s experts have initially characterized it), but rather relies on a
comparison of the subject company to comparable companies, thus making it an
“inherently market approach”.''*? In the Respondent’s view, for a project in which the
cash flow can be estimated (which in the Respondent’s view is not the case for Las
Cristinas) the DCF method would be the appropriate method. Yet, the Claimant has
never presented a DCF method.

Finally, according to the Respondent, the NAV approach has received no support in
investment treaty jurisprudence.!'*

In relation to the calculations provided by the Claimant in response to the Tribunal’s
25 July 2014 Questions, Venezuela points to the Claimant’s own submission that the
new calculations “artificially generate” P/NAV ratios through a process of reverse
engineering that cannot form the basis of a damages calculation.''** The Respondent
stresses that the Claimant itself has characterized its experts’ new analysis as

“hypothetical (and counterfactual) P/NAV multiples”, which leads to “absurd
results”.!'45 Venezuela submits that such new calculations should thus be ignored.

With regard to the new sensitivities requested by the Tribunal, Venezuela contends that
the Claimant’s experts admit that they have not selected new “comparable” companies
based on analyst reports as of 13 April 2008, but have rather conducted a non-analytical
“running of numbers” based on the reverse-engineered P/NAV multiples previously
utilized.''°

The Respondent also highlights that the Claimant’s experts point out that based on Mr.
Ellis’ scenario a 20-year mine life illogically becomes more valuable than a 40-year
mine life.''*” This, for the Respondent, calls into question the reliability of that plan and
the Claimant’s experts’ judgment in relying on that plan for their valuations.''*

 

Thus, Venezuela concludes, also the new P/NAV valuations supplied by the Claimant’s
experts are defective and should not be relied on.!!4°

iii. The relative market multiple approach
(a) The Claimant's position

According to the Claimant, the relative market multiple approach provides a market-
based method for assessing the value of Las Cristinas based on the enterprise value
(EV) and the size of reserves of publicly-traded gold mining companies. Compass
Lexecon analyzed the market prices of 146 publicly traded gold mining companies
operating in developing countries characterized by country risk similar to that of
Venezuela, as of February 2011. It expressed the market multiples value in US$ of EV
per ounce of reserves equivalent of gold, and found that on 3 February 2011, the group
of gold mining companies operating in developing countries traded at a median value
of approximately US$ 154.04 per ounce.!!®° The EV-to-Reserves Equivalent multiple
was adjusted to reflect a 20% control premium, and then applied to the amount of in
situ gold reserves at Las Cristinas as of 3 February 2011.!!>' This amount was further
adjusted for historical cash flows and debt of Las Cristinas to take into account the
investment Crystallex would have needed to make in order for Las Cristinas to be

producing as of 3 February 2011.''*? Under this approach the Claimant’s damages
number US$ 2.75 billion under the 40-year horizon, and US$ 1.60 billion under the 20
years production scenario.!!*

The Claimant submits that the market multiples approach is particularly appropriate to
the gold mining industry, where companies, irrespective of their geographic location,
exhibit a myriad of similar market characteristics — including risk and growth profiles
— and respond to similar economic variables.''* This approach has also been
vindicated, Crystallex contends, by international tribunals.'!55

The Claimant provided further calculations in response to the Tribunal’s 25 July 2015
Questions, wherein the Tribunal had asked the following:

“To supply the necessary data and the calculations in relation to the market
multiples method, assuming:

(i) The date of valuation is (a) 13 April 2008 or (b) 3 February 2011;
(ii) A control premium of 20% or, in the alternative, no control premium;
(iii) The duration is (a) 20 years or (b) 40 years;

(iv) The extraction rate is 20,000 tpd moving to 40,000 tpd in year 3 (assume
no “unconstrained” scenario).”"

The Claimant explains that to provide the Tribunal with the information it sought in
relation to the hypothetical scenarios outlined in its letter of 25 July 2014, the
Claimant’s experts, following the same criteria as in their prior submissions: (a)
compiled a new sample of companies operating in the gold industry in April 2008; (b)
narrowed their sample to isolate those companies operating in developing countries;
and (c) applied the resulting multiple, in keeping with the methodology they applied in
their 2011 Market Multiple valuation.!!*”

The results are summarized in the following table:

To each of those figures, the Claimant contends that the so-called consequential
damages in the amount of US$ 180 million should be added.!!8

The Claimant stresses that the use of the control premium is necessary in order to adjust
for the full value of the company given that share prices represent only a company’s
fractional value as perceived by shareholders.'!*? Furthermore, it is reasonable to
assume a 40-year contract length, because a reasonable investor limited by a 20-year
contract would proceed to mine all the gold that is economically feasible to extract at
the prevailing gold price over the period of time available.!! The Claimant submits
that contract duration is simply not a factor taken into consideration in a market
multiples valuation, because the EV data, upon which the analysis is based,
incorporates all known risks, including the risk of non-renewal of the contract.!!®!

(b) The Respondent's position

The Respondent first contends, in general terms, that all three market-based
methodologies presented by the Claimant suffer from the same shortcoming, namely
that "no two mining properties are the same" and that each mining project has its own
unique features such as the size of its reserves, regulatory environment and location,
thereby making valuations on the basis of comparables either extremely difficult or
impossible.!'®

With specific regard to the “relative market multiple approach”, the Respondent
submits that the value of Las Cristinas is not equivalent to the value of Crystallex,!'!©
and thus such methodology is simply inapplicable.!'® Furthermore, the approach
followed by Compass Lexecon is flawed because, inter alia, the Claimant's experts
failed to consider a number of factors to determine if the company was comparable or
not, such as the geography of the location, the operating history of the company and its
ability to raise financing.!!>

In relation to the calculations provided by the Claimant in response to the Tribunal’s
25 July 2014 Questions, the Respondent first notes that, unlike with their P/NAV
analysis, the Claimant’s experts have undertaken to identify new “comparable”
companies as of 13 April 2008 in order to yield a market multiple based upon EV to
Gold Reserve Equivalent. However, according to the Respondent, some of Compass
Lexecon’s 73 comparable companies bear absolutely no resemblance to Crystallex.
Venezuela points in particular to Nautilus Minerals, which is involved in underwater
exploration of the seafloor in attempts to mine copper, zinc, silver and gold primarily
in the waters of Papua New Guinea.'!

Furthermore, Venezuela contends that the Claimant’s experts rely on Mr. Ellis’
erroneous resource and operational calculations (which assume that Crystallex would
mine 80,000 tpd, stockpile 40,000 tpd, and select the best 40,000 tonnes of ore to
process in the first 20 years).

iv. The stock market study valuation approach
(a) The Claimant's position

The stock market study approach to valuation is a comparative valuation methodology
that seeks to assess the damage to the value of Crystallex’s stock price by reference to
the evolution of stock prices for other, similarly placed, gold mining companies not
affected by Venezuela’s expropriatory measures.'!®? The Claimant contends that
because Crystallex is a one-asset company and the right to mine Las Cristinas is that
single asset, the evolution of the share price of Crystallex gives a good indication of
how the market has perceived the effects of the actions of Venezuela with regard to Las

1163 See First ER Hart, para. 139 (“it was not until after 2009 that Las Cristinas became Crystallex’s sole project.

And even once this occurred, the value of the
same”), para. 174 (“the value of Las Cristi

 

as Cristinas Project and the value of Crystallex are not one and the
not equal to the value of Crystallex (project vs. company)”).

Cristinas and how, as a consequence, the market has radically discounted the value of
Crystallex’s share price accordingly.!!°

According to the Claimant and its experts, the stock market approach is based on the
proposition that Crystallex’s market capitalization prior to the measures represented the
company’s value (minus the control premium). This value was then adjusted based
upon the assumptions that, once the bond has been posted and the taxes paid, the Permit
would have been issued, and that Crystallex’s stock price would have continued to grow
at the same rate as that of other gold companies, represented by the average of four
indices of gold mining stocks, but for the impact of Venezuela’s unlawful measures.!'!©?

For the Claimant, the market capitalization of a company by definition incorporates the
market’s assessment of all known costs and risks related to that particular asset.!!”° It
is an appropriate valuation method in this case because Crystallex was actively and
heavily traded on two of the main stock exchanges for mining companies,'!”! and
during the relevant period under consideration, Crystallex was effectively a single-asset
company, its principal asset being the right to develop Las Cristinas. In fact, in 2007,
Crystallex’s investment in Las Cristinas formed 99.97% of its total value, and by 2008,
the right to mine Las Cristinas formed 100% of Crystallex’s value. This means,
according to the Claimant, that Crystallex’s stock price in 2007 directly reflected the
market’s assessment of the value of the right to mine Las Cristinas.!!7?

In this case, the stock market study approach involves projecting what Crystallex’s
stock price would have been but for the alleged expropriation (and any threat or action
implying a path to expropriation).''”? The Claimant’s experts forecast the but-for
evolution of Crystallex’s stock price starting on 14 June 2007 (i.e., the date when
Crystallex announced and represented that it had completed its filing requirements for
the issuance of the Permit needed to commence construction — the “last available clean
date”) until 3 February 2011 4 According to the Claimant, the market, based on its
experience with Gold Reserve (which had received its permit one month after the
approval of its EIS), expected Crystallex to receive the Permit almost immediately after
its 14 June 2007 announcement. Thereafter, as time passed and Crystallex’s Permit was

not issued, Crystallex’s share price started to fall significantly and quickly, reflecting
investors’ concerns that Venezuela had decided to withhold the Permit.!!’°

For the purposes of the stock market study methodology, Compass Lexecon estimated
Crystallex’s but-for stock price through the following process:

(1) It applied a one-time percentage increase to Crystallex’s stock price to reflect the
removal of the uncertainty related to the Permit. With respect to such permitting bump,
Compass Lexecon utilized as comparator the actual increase in the stock price of Gold
Reserve on the day the market learned that its investment in Venezuela’s Las Brisas
deposit had received its Permit.!!” The Claimant contends that Gold Reserve is a
particularly good comparator, because, like Crystallex, it was a single-asset gold mining
company seeking to develop a mine in Venezuela, and because Las Brisas is adjacent to
Las Cristinas, with similar geology and ore mineralization and is subject to the same
regulations.''7? On the day Gold Reserve obtained its Permit, Gold Reserve’s shares
increased by 49% and Crystallex’s own shares increased by 27% (based on the
expectation that Crystallex would also receive its Permit). Thus, Compass Lexecon
applied a permitting bump for Las Cristinas of 16.7%. This percentage reflects the fact
that the market already took into account that it gave Crystallex a small bump when Gold
Reserve received its permit and thus the 16.7% bump represents the likely additional
price increase that would have occurred if the Permit had been granted to Crystallex.!!7*

(2) It applied the rate of growth in benchmark industry indices of the stock prices of
large, established and widely traded gold mining companies during the same relevant
period (i.e. mid-2007 to 3 February 2011, in order to re-express that value as of 3
February 2011).!!”
(3) Finally, because each share price represents the value of a minority interest, Compass
Lexecon applied a 20% control premium. According to the Claimant, the use of a control
premium is necessary in order to adjust for the full value of the company.'!8°
By this approach, Compass Lexecon has estimated damages to the Claimant at US$
2.83 billion as of 3 February 2011.
In its post-hearing submission, the Claimant provided further stock market sensitivities
in response to Tribunal’s Question 10 of the 4 March 2014 Questions.!!*!

811. | Furthermore, in its 25 July 2014 Questions, the Tribunal asked the following question
in relation to the stock market approach:

“To supply the necessary data and the calculations in relation to the stock
market approach:

(i) Assuming the date of valuation is (a) 13 April 2008 or (b) 3 February
2011;

(ii) Assuming a stock price from 14 June 2007;

(iii) Assuming a control premium of 20% or, in the alternative, no control
premium;

(iv) Applying the permitting bump (as set forth by the Claimant) or, in the
alternative, excluding a permitting bump;

(v) Using the Market Vectors Junior Gold Mining Index (Exh. CLEX-96) to
project the growth of Crystallex’s share price to (a) 13 April 2008 or (b) 3
February 2011”.'!?

In addition to reiterating the validity of its originally chosen sensitivities, the Claimant
notes that the use of the average of four indices (iShare Global Gold, Market Vectors
Gold Miner, HSBC Global Mining Index Gold, and the TSXG old Mining Index) as a
basis for the evolution of Crystallex’s but-for share price is appropriate, as no single
index necessarily represents a better proxy than the other and averaging the four main
indices ensures more certain coverage of the industry’s performance as a whole. The
Claimant’s experts also note that during the period under examination, Crystallex’ stock
was indeed part of the iShares Global Gold and TSX Gold Mining indices.''*+ By
contrast, a stock market based valuation of Crystallex’s investment that relies
exclusively on the junior gold index will inevitably be overly conservative.!!*>

(b) The Respondent's position

815. | According to the Respondent, the stock market study approach used by Compass
Lexecon relies on unfounded assumptions.''*° Like the market multiples approach, also
the stock market approach is not applicable in this situation because the purpose of the
valuation should be to provide a value of Crystallex’s interest in Las Cristinas, not the
value of Crystallex as a company.!!*7

 

816. | The Respondent has put forward the following arguments as to why the stock market
approach is an inappropriate and unreliable methodology:

. According to the Respondent, practitioners and arbitral tribunals are wary of the
stock market study as a valuation methodology, because stock prices may
depend on many external factors and change quickly, often merely on
psychological grounds.''** In their Supplemental Reports, the Respondent and
its expert, Mr. Hart, have pointed to episodes where the stock price of Crystallex
experienced significant one-day increases following a simple recommendation
made by a popular U.S. TV stock market commentator.!!8°

. The stock market study falsely assumes an efficient market with full information
on Crystallex.!!®° For the Respondent, documents on the record demonstrate that
Crystallex provided inconsistent if not misleading information to the market.!!?!
Furthermore, according to Venezuela, history of capital markets has proven that
information is often not transparently provided to the market, that stock prices
can deviate from a company’s fair market value and that markets crash when
stock prices deviate substantially from the fair market values of listed
companies.!!°?

. Crystallex’s stock was too volatile to yield a reliable calculation.!'!*

The Claimant’s choice of 14 June 2007 is arbitrary, if not opportunistic, and only
serves to highlight the stock market study’s intrinsic flaws.'!°* For the
Respondent, there exist other contemporaneous dates after 14 June 2007 on
which the Claimant received positive news with respect to regulatory actions,
which should cause one to question why none of these dates has been chosen
despite their closer proximity to the Permit denial date. For the Respondent, the
answer lies in the fact that the Claimant’s stock had lost significant value by
then.!!°5

The 16.7% permitting bump is based on only one other company (Gold
Reserve), as opposed to a “peer group” of companies, and moreover is temporary
(as stocks tend to decrease again shortly after a bump).!!°°

The industry indexes used by the Claimant do not accurately represent the
Claimant.!!97

In relation to the Claimant’s calculations provided in response to the Tribunal’s 25 July
2014 Questions, the Respondent, in addition to reiterating that it considers the stock
market approach flawed both conceptually and in its application,'!®* argues that the
Market Vectors Junior Gold Mining Index does not accurately represent Crystallex, but
rather “transform[s Crystallex] into a company with mines in several global regions
with the ability to diversify risks, something it never was and never would be able to
do in the real world”.!!°

vy. The indirect sales comparison method
(a) The Claimant's position

The indirect sales comparison method is also referred to as the market transaction
method. !2 It is a variation of the relative market multiple valuation, where, however,
actual transactions, rather than equity values, are used for comparison analysis.'2°!

The Ellis Report calculates the relative value of Crystallex’s rights in Las Cristinas by
reference to 16 transactions involving large gold mining properties, which occurred

between January 2006 and February 2012. By adjusting a number of variables specific
to each of the mining properties that were the subject matter of these transactions, Mr.
Ellis arrives at the market-based valuation of the price Las Cristinas would fetch if sold
at the date of 3 February 2011.!2°

Mr. Ellis concedes that no two mineral properties are alike.'?? However, he argues that
by analyzing a number of similar transacted properties and making appropriate
adjustments for the inevitable differences in, inter alia, geological and geographic
characteristics, the market transaction method allows the valuator to make as good as
possible a comparison between non-identical mineral properties.!?°

By this methodology, Mr. Ellis arrives at a value of US$ 4.14 billion (based on the
scenario that Las Cristinas would be operated at a production rate of 40,000 tpd for 40
years), 1205

Mr. Ellis has also conducted a similar comparison using a smaller sample of two
significant transactions involving one mine in Venezuela, Choco 10, that took place in
2006 and 2007.!2 In this case, Mr. Ellis has concluded that the value of Las Cristinas
based on a market transaction valuation with Choco 10 would have been US$7.4 billion
under an unconstrained scenario.!”°’ The Claimant has used only the US$4.25 billion
figure (and not the US$7.4 billion figure related to the Choco 10 transaction) to arrive
at its average of the four valuation methodologies.

(b) The Respondent's position

The Respondent submits that the market transaction method is also flawed because,
inter alia, none of the transactions (involving other gold companies) used by the
Claimant's expert, Mr. Ellis, are comparable to Crystallex and because the experts’
"adjustments are too plentiful to render the method of any practical value".!?°8 Mr. Hart
also criticizes the time period covered by the chosen transactions (2006-2012) and the
size of the adjustments made to the transacted properties in order to compare them to

also provided an unconstrained scenario, on the basis that, in light of the increase in

Las Cristinas.'2” In Mr. Hart’s view, only one out of the 16 projects may be considered
comparable, i.e. the Tocantinzho Project in Brasil.!?!°

824. Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Claimant does not provide legal authority
to quantify damages on this basis and that investment tribunals do not widely accept
the comparable sales transaction approach. '7!!

vi. The cost approach
(a) The Claimant's position

825. For the Claimant, a costs or “book value” approach would not be appropriate in this
instance as a matter of international law, and would allow Venezuela to retain a huge
windfall between the sunk costs and the Fair Market Value of the right to mine (which
it may sell or use as collateral for that full value). Crystallex would thus not receive full
reparation in such a case.'?!?

826. The Claimant points to Canadian mining standards CIMVal (prepared by the Canadian
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Special Committee on Valuation),
according to which a cost approach is not appropriate for “development properties”, !?!>

such as Crystallex.!?!4

827. The Claimant contends that a cost approach is normally used in those instances where
there is no better guide to an investment’s value, such as where there is no clear market
for the expropriated asset or where the business prospects for the investor are wholly
unclear, such as the expropriation of an industrial business selling a product or service
for which there is no proven market. The Claimant submits that this situation is different
from a gold mine with proven resources in an open, global market where gold is selling
for US$1,300/oz and where there is a clear market for even non-producing mines.'?!5
The Claimant adds that, if Crystallex had simply invested US$ 650 million in gold at

209 First ER Hart, paras 203-208.
'210 First ER Hart, para. 205.
211 Counter-Memorial, para. 649.

212 C-PHB, paras 684-694.

   

213 The CIMVal guidelines define “development property” as “Mineral Property that is being prepared for mineral
production and for which economic viability has been demonstrated by a Feasibility Study or Prefeasibility Study
and includes a Mineral Property which has a Current positive Feasibility Study or Prefeasibility Study but which
is not yet financed or under construction.” See Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Special
Committee on Valuation, “Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties,” February 2003, Exh.

the time of its initial investment in Las Cristinas, it would have been worth more than
US$ 2.8 billion in 2011 or US$ 2 billion in 2008.!!°

For the Claimant, the true value of Crystallex’s right to mine Las Cristinas does not
appear on Crystallex’s historical balance sheets, because it is an intangible asset whose
value would be reflected on a balance sheet only after mining began or upon an
acquisition at arm’s-length.!?!

Without prejudice to its position that a cost approach would be inappropriate to assess
the fair market value of Las Cristinas, the Claimant has provided sunk cost figures in
response to one of the Tribunal’s questions.'?!8 According to the Claimant, Crystallex’s
historical investment in Las Cristinas from 2002 to 2013 totals more than US$ 644
million.'?'? According to the Claimant, with the exception of the 2013 figures, which
have been supplied by Crystallex’s management, all of the data provided is drawn
directly from Crystallex’s audited Financial Statements.'??? Compass Lexecon have
verified the figures and have made minor corrections, as a result of which the total cost
figure equals US$ 644.88 million. !7?!

(b) The Respondent's position

Given that Las Cristinas is a late exploration / early evaluation and design stage project,
with uncertain future cash streams, for the Respondent and its expert, the only
appropriate method to value Crystallex’s interest in Las Cristinas is a cost approach,
which measures the actual amount spent on the project to date and evaluates the
contribution to value made by these funds.'?? By contrast, forward-looking
methodologies that rely on future cash flows would be speculative in the absence of
definitive studies or any record of earnings.!?2>

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not put forward a cost claim or any of the
necessary supporting details that would include at least project budgets, invoices,
operating contracts, evidence of cash payments and accounting ledger support.'?74
Based on the information available, in his First Report Mr. Hart contends that
Crystallex reported that the costs incurred through the first quarter of 2008 were US$

323.8 million.'?> The Respondent points out that the Claimant has not provided
supporting documentation for the US$323.8 million figure, and therefore, a thorough
analysis of the accuracy and completeness of this figure is impossible.'??°

For the Respondent, assuming for the sake of argument that the total invested costs
were US$ 323.8.8 million, non-prudent or recoverable costs and costs not attributable
to the project must be subtracted from this figure to yield a valuation amount under the
cost approach. !?77

First, US$ 37.8 million recovered from the sale of equipment stored outside of
Venezuela would have to be subtracted.!2?8 Second, a US$ 32 million of tax liability,
resulting from Crystallex’s weaknesses in its accounting practices, should be
considered wasteful.'??? Finally, management costs spent imprudently cannot be
recovered by the Claimant.'?*°

In relation to the Claimant’s responses to the Tribunal’s 25 July 2014 Questions, the
Respondent reiterates that the Claimant has steadfastly refused to present the necessary
documents and information concerning its actual costs. Thus a proper cost approach
analysis, including a proper assessment of costs and expenses, is impossible.'?*!
Venezuela further argues that a number of inappropriate cost components submitted by
the Claimant should be excluded, as they are not investment costs spent on Las
Cristinas.!°? Furthermore, Claimant’s analysis (as reviewed and adjusted by its
experts) provides no assessment of the contributory value of any of the costs
claimed.'?5

In order to comply with the Tribunal’s 25 July 2014 Questions (without endorsing any
of those figures), Venezuela and its expert arrive at a calculation of the Claimant’s spent
costs for the Las Cristinas project of between US$ 240-245 million. !?*4

vii. Conclusion
(a) The Claimant's position

In conclusion, the Claimant claims the sum of US$ 3.16 billion by way of damages,
which is the average of all four of the valuations conducted by its experts, which, it
contends, most accurately represents the fair market value of its investment in Las
Cristinas on 3 February 2011.

The Claimant contends that the valuation which it has put forward in this arbitration is
conservative when compared to the value of peer companies as of 3 February 2011, and
given the inherent potential of the Las Cristinas site.'?*°

(b) The Respondent’s position

According to the Respondent, if the Tribunal were to find Venezuela liable under the
Treaty, the Claimant would still not be able to recover any damages, because it has
failed to meet its burden of proving and substantiating the quantum of any injuries.!?*°

The Claimant has relied on inappropriate methodologies, premised on speculative
assumptions, to arrive at incomplete, inaccurate and inflated damages amounts.
Venezuela contends that, from the very beginning of this arbitration, it has noted the
defects and flaws in the Claimant’s approach and has indicated that the more
appropriate methodology would be the cost approach. Nevertheless, the Claimant has
failed to provide all the necessary information. It has also failed to provide evidence
and analyses that would assist the Tribunal in alternative approaches to damages,
something the Claimant also bore the burden to do. In light of this, Venezuela submits
that the Claimant’s request for damages be denied in its entirety.!?*7

2. Analysis

The order chosen by the Tribunal to address the issues relating to monetary
compensation does not necessarily follow the one(s) advanced by the Parties, but
reflects the order which the Tribunal considers appropriate under the circumstances for
the purposes of a logical and coherent reasoning. The Tribunal will thus first set out
what it considers to be the standard of compensation applicable to this case (a). It will
then deal with the question of the valuation date (b) and address issues of burden of
proof and causation (c). It will next move to the determination of the “fair market value”
of the Claimant’s investment and, in that context, deal with the different valuation
methodologies presented by the Parties (d-f).

a. The standard of compensation

The Treaty vests the Tribunal with the power to award “monetary damages and any
applicable interest” in case of breach of an obligation contained in the Treaty (Article
XII(9) of the BIT). It does not, however, as is generally the case with BITs,!7** detail
any standard of compensation which the Tribunal must apply when awarding such
monetary damages. The only reference to a standard of compensation is the one
contained in Article VII(1) of the Treaty. Article VII(1) of the BIT provides that:

“Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect
equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
“expropriation”) in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a
public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner
and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such
compensation shall be based on the genuine value of the investment or
returns expropriated immediately before the expropriation or at the time the
proposed expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier,
shall be payable from the date of expropriation with interest at a normal
commercial rate, shall be paid without delay and shall be effectively
realizable and freely transferable.”

It is undisputed that such reference concerns the compensation requirement for an
expropriation to be considered compliant with Article VII(1) of the Treaty. The Parties
are, however, in dispute as to whether such standard also applies to expropriations not
meeting one or more of the Treaty requirements and to violations of other Treaty
standards (such as FET or FPS), or whether in such cases the “full reparation” standard
set out in Chorzow should apply.

While in other cases this question may have important consequences, the Tribunal
considers that in this particular case this discussion is rather theoretical and devoid of
significant practical effects. In the Tribunal’s view, to follow the BIT expropriation
standard as opposed to “full reparation” under Chorzéw may in particular produce
different outcomes where the BIT standard would lead to a valuation date as of the date
of the expropriation, whereas full reparation may require, under certain circumstances,
the valuation date to be fixed at the date of the award.

In this case, however, neither Party has argued in favor of the application of a valuation
date as of the date of the award. Rather, as the Tribunal will explain infra when dealing
with the valuation date, both Parties agree that the valuation date in this case should be

aid down in Article II. This is a problem common to most bilateral investment treaties

 

  

and other agreements such as NAFTA.” CMS v. Argentina, Final Award, 12 May 2005, Exh. CLA-45, para. 409.

233

the date of expropriation (they disagree on whether such date should be fixed in April
2008 or February 2011, which, however, is a different question).

845. Furthermore, the Parties agree that monetary damages must be assessed by reference to
the fair market value (which is both the standard required under customary international
law, and the one applicable under the BIT which speaks of “genuine value” or “valeur
réelle” or “valor genuino’”). As rightly noted by the Respondent, the Parties’
disagreement over the applicable standard of reparation is thus “ultimately largely

irrelevant” .'29

846. With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal wishes to make the following remarks
in relation to the standard of compensation applicable in this case. First, as a general
matter, the Tribunal considers that the standard of compensation contained in Article
VII(1) of the Treaty is not the appropriate standard of compensation in cases of
breaches of that provision, i.e., when the requirements set out in Article VII(1) are not
met. One particular question is whether the BIT standard is, however, applicable in
cases of expropriations merely lacking compensation. This point may be left open here,
as in any event the Tribunal is of the view that the Article VII(1) “standard” is only
concerned with expropriation, and not breaches of other BIT standards. Because the
Tribunal has found breaches of FET (in addition to an expropriation), the Tribunal
considers that the “full reparation” principle under customary international law must be
applied as a consequence of its decision on liability.!4° In other words, given the
cumulative nature of the breaches that the Tribunal must compensate, and especially in
view of its findings on FET that the Respondent’s conduct caused all the investments
made by Crystallex to become worthless, the Tribunal will apply the full reparation
standard according to customary international law.

847. | Anauthoritative description of the principle of full reparation was provided by the PCIJ
in Chorzow in the following terms:

“The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act—a
principle which seems to be established by international practice and in
particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals—is that reparation must, as
far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-

'239 Rejoinder, para. 532 ("Claimant agrees that monetary damages pursuant to Article XII(9) must be assessed by
reference to the fair market value of its investment at the time of the alleged deprivation, consistent with Article
VII(1) of the BIT. The only implication from the customary international law standard that Claimant appears to
concretely wish to draw is (i) that a date of valuation other than the date of the alleged deprivation be applicable,
and (ii) that the award include of [sic] compound interest and a tax indemnity”) (footnotes omitted).

establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act
had not been committed.”!™"

848. The principle of full reparation set forth in Chorzéw was later codified in the ILC
Articles, which, while developed in the inter-state context, have routinely been applied
also in the investor-state arbitration context.!2

849. Article 31 of the ILC Articles imposes upon the responsible State “an obligation to
make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.” Article
36 specifies that “[t]he State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not
made good by restitution” and that “[t]he compensation shall cover any financially
assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.”

850. | Furthermore, it is well-accepted that reparation should reflect the “fair market value”
of the investment. Appraising the investment in accordance with the fair market value
methodology indeed ensures that the consequences of the breach are wiped out and that
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if the wrongful acts had not
been committed is reestablished.'74* As stated in the Commentary of the ILC Articles
on State Responsibility,

“[C]ompensation reflecting the capital value of property taken or destroyed
as the result of an internationally wrongful act is generally assessed on the
basis of the ‘fair market value’ of the property lost.”!24

851. In the words of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, “fair market value” means

p.47.

'2# The Tribunal is aware that Part Two of the ILC Articles, which sets out the legal consequences of internationally
wrongful acts, may not apply, at least directly, to cases involving persons or entities other than States, such as in
investment disputes as is the case here. In particular, it is aware that Comment (3) to Article 28 states that “[...]
while Part One applies to all the cases in which an internationally wrongful act may be committed by a State, Part
Two has a more limited scope. It does not apply to obligations of reparation to the extent that these arise towards
or are invoked by a person or entity other than a State. In other words, the provisions of Part Two are without
prejudice to any right, arising from the international responsibility of a State, which may accrue directly to any
person or entity other than a State, and article 33 makes this clear.” That being said, the ILC Articles reflect
customary international law in the matter of state responsibility, and to the extent that a matter is not addressed by
the Treaty applicable to this case and that there are no circumstances commanding otherwise, the Tribunal will turn
to the ILC Articles for guidance. In this case, for instance, they are relied upon to confirm Chorzéw. The Tribunal
further notes that the Claimant has cited to the ILC Articles and, while Venezuela cautions that the ILC Articles
are not appropriate in the context of this investor-state dispute, it has referred to them in its written pleadings “to
the extent that they may be used as guidance”. See Counter-Memorial, p. 291, fn. 1074.

“[...] the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in
circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to maximize
his financial gain, and neither was under duress or threat. [The expert]
appropriately assumed that the willing buyer was a_ reasonable
businessman”.'*45

Or, in the words of the CMS tribunal, the “fair market value” of an investment refers
to:

“[T]he price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would
change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a
hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arms [sic] length in an open and
unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and
when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.’”!™4°

The Tribunal will thus assess the consequences of the Respondent’s breaches using a
fair market methodology. The first question, to which the Tribunal now turns, is at what
date the Claimant’s investment must be valued.

b. The valuation date

As has already been mentioned, both Parties agree that in this case the proper date of
valuation should be the date of expropriation (which, as noted, is also the date specified
in Article VII(1) of the Treaty if one were to apply that provision as the standard of
compensation for any Treaty breaches, which is not the case here). The Parties,
however, disagree as to when such date of expropriation should be identified. The
Claimant has argued for a 3 February 2011 valuation date, while the Respondent favors
13 April 2008.

Upon consideration of the Parties’ respective positions, the Tribunal sees merit in the
choice of both dates. On balance, however, it considers that 13 April 2008 is the most
appropriate valuation date in this particular case, for the following reasons. First, April
2008 is the date that coincides with the culmination of the events surrounding the Permit
denial which the Tribunal has found to be both a self-standing breach of FET and the
first important act giving rise to the creeping expropriation. It is beyond peradventure
that the Claimant’s investment in Las Cristinas was negatively impacted with the denial
of the Permit, and this fact would no doubt have been considered by a hypothetical
buyer of Crystallex’s investment.

Second, from April 2008 until 2011, the operation at the mining site was essentially at
a standstill and the Claimant spent its time and funds maintaining the site in condition,

preparing for a possible resumption of operation, but not exploring or exploiting the
site. The Claimant was possibly endeavoring to obtain the Permit, but had already
notified its Notice of Dispute. While during this period, the CVG reassured Crystallex
that the MOC was still binding and enforceable, it was also clear that it could not be
practically enforced. In other words, while the Claimant may have still harbored hopes
that the Permit would be granted, the governmental interference with the permitting
process which had occurred at that point in time was such that it made Crystallex’s
rights practically useless.

857. It should be added as a third reason that in its Notice of Dispute of 24 November 2008
the Claimant indicated that it considered the denial of the Permit — as well as subsequent
statements by the Minister of Mines — to have created an investment dispute under the
terms of the Treaty. This provides further confirmation that in the Claimant’s own eyes,
the dispute had already materialized in 2008, which implies that the Claimant itself
considered that a breach had been committed by then.

858. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides to assess the Claimant’s damages at the
valuation date of 13 April 2008.

c. General issues: Causation and burden of proof

859. Before determining the fair market value of Crystallex’s investment at the valuation
date which the Tribunal has considered appropriate, the Tribunal finds it useful at this
stage to address certain preliminary issues of causation and burden/standard of proof.

860. | With regard to causation, under international law, compensation for violation of a treaty
will only be due from a respondent state if there is a sufficient causal link between the
treaty breach by that state and the loss sustained by the claimant.!24”

861. Indeed, Article XII(1) of the Treaty requires that the investor “has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach [of the Treaty]”.

862. However, in this arbitration, the actual issue is less a matter of principle than a matter
of proof of the causal link and of the quantum of the damage sustained. Crystallex is
asserting that it suffered losses that are the result of the destruction of its investment
and these losses would be incurred by reason of and arise out of the Respondent’s

"247 See Art. 31, para.1, of the ILC Articles and relating commentary. See also Gemplus, S.A., et al. v. Mexico,

wrongful acts during the permitting process and thereafter. In other words, whatever
the breach of the Treaty the Tribunal retains, that wrongful act is at the origin of the
injury and the actual difficulty is to determine to what extent the Claimant has proven
that its damage flows from that internationally wrongful act. The Tribunal considers
that the losses sustained by Crystallex did result from the destruction of its investment
and were incurred by reason of the Respondent’s wrongful acts during the permitting
process and thereafter. Thus, they should be remedied to the extent of those wrongful
acts, or, to use the Treaty’s language, by reason of such acts.

With regard to issues of proof, the BIT does not set out any specific rules. ICSID AF
Rule 41(1), under which the Tribunal operates, provides in turn that “[t]he Tribunal
shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative
value”, which thus grants the Tribunal full discretion in these matters. Such discretion
applies also in respect of the weight to be assigned to the evidence proffered in respect
of damages calculations.

That being said, as a general matter, it is clear that it is the Claimant that bears the
burden of proof in relation to the fact and the amount of loss.

The issue of the standard of proof, by contrast, relates to the degree of proof required
for the Claimant to discharge its burden of proof. The Parties have debated whether the
Tribunal should apply a “balance of probabilities” or a “sufficient degree of certainty”
test. In the Tribunal’s view, these tests chiefly reflect common law concepts (whereby
the balance of probabilities standard, or preponderance of the evidence, is opposed to
the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard, normally used in criminal matters). In
continental legal systems, by contrast, the matter of proof is left to the personal
appreciation of the judge (inner conviction, “intime conviction”). If the judge is
persuaded of the truth of a certain matter, then the standard of proof has been met.'?48

Having those different approaches in mind and considering that the Tribunal is
operating as an international arbitral body established under the framework of an
international treaty, the Tribunal considers that, in the exercise of its discretion granted
to it in relation to issues of evidence, it should be guided by the following principles.

First, the fact (i.e., the existence) of the damage needs to be proven with certainty. In
that sense, there is no reason to apply any different standard of proof than that which is
applied to any other issue of merits (e.g., liability).

Second, once the fact of damage has been established, a claimant should not be required
to prove its exact quantification with the same degree of certainty. This is because any
future damage is inherently difficult to prove. As the tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine
observed,

'248 On these issues, see generally S. Ripinsky & K. Williams, Damages In International Investment Law, British
Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008, Exh. CLA-66, Exh. CLA-159, Exh, RLA-93, pp. 161-167.

238

“To]nce causation has been established, and it has been proven that the in
bonis party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of
the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only
needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable
confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.”!"”

869. The tribunal is of the view that the emphasis should be put on the phrase “with
reasonable confidence” which seems to strike a wholesome and pragmatic approach,
prone to satisfy common law and civil law minds.

870. Other tribunals have come to similar conclusions. In SPP v. Egypt, for example, the
tribunal noted that “it is well-settled that the fact that damages cannot be assessed with
certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss had been incurred”.!?°° And in
Tecmed, the tribunal observed that “any difficulty in determining the compensation
does not prevent the assessment of such compensation where the existence of damage

is certain”.!25!

871. Thus, an impossibility or even a considerable difficulty that would make it
unconscionable to prove the amount (rather than the existence) of damages with
absolute precision does not bar their recovery altogether. Arbitral tribunals have been
prepared to award compensation on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the loss,
where they felt confident about the fact of the loss itself.'25? In the Tribunal’s view, this

the fact that damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been
incurred”).

   

1252 The Tribunal finds further confirmation in Gold Reserve, where the tribunal noted that:

 

..] while a claimant must prove its damages to the required standard, the sment of damages
is often a difficult exercise and it is seldom that damages in an investment situation will be able to
be established with scientific certainty. This is because such assessments will usually involve some
degree of estimation and the weighing of competing (but equally legitimate) facts, valuation methods
and opinions, which does not of itself mean that the burden of proof has not been satisfied. Because
of this element of imprecision, it is accepted that tribunals retain a certain amount of discretion or a
“margin of appreciation” when a g damages, which will necessarily involve some
approximation. The use of this discretion should not be confused with acting on an ex aequo et bono
basis, even if equitable considerations are taken into account in the exercise of such discretion.
Rather, in such circumstances, the tribunal exercises its judgment in a reasoned manner so as to
discern an appropriate damages sum which results in compensation to Claimant in accordance with
the principles of international law that have been discussed earlier”.

approach may be particularly warranted if the uncertainty in determining what exactly
would have happened is the result of the other party’s wrongdoing.

These principles should also be applied with regard to the proof of loss of profits, which
is the crucial issue in this case as far as the determination of quantum is concerned.

The ILC Articles recognize that in certain cases compensation for loss of profits may
be appropriate. Indeed, Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles provides that “[t]he
compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits
insofar as it is established”. The commentary to the ILC Articles further notes that
“Tt]tribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherently
speculative elements” and “[i]n cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it
has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be
considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable. This
has normally been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements or, in some cases, a

well-established history of dealings”.!25*

Furthermore, according to an oft-cited authority, “in order to be allowable, prospective
profits must not be too speculative, contingent, uncertain, and the like. There must be
proof that they were reasonably anticipated; and that the profits anticipated were
probable and not merely possible”.'* The same idea was expressed by the tribunal in
ADM v. Mexico which held that “lost profits are allowable insofar as the Claimants
prove that the alleged damage is not speculative or uncertain — i.e., that the profits
anticipated were probable or reasonably anticipated and not merely possible”.!?>
Furthermore, the Vivendi v. Argentina tribunal noted that “compensation for lost profits
is generally awarded only where future profitability can be established (the fact of

profitability as opposed to the amount) with some level of certainty”.!?°°

In the Tribunal’s view, all these authorities show that, once the fact of future
profitability is established and is not essentially of speculative nature, the amount of
such profits need not be proven with the same degree of certainty. In other words, the
Claimant must prove that it has been deprived of profits that would have actually been
earned. This requires proving that there is sufficient certainty that it had engaged or
would have engaged in a profitmaking activity but for the Respondent’s wrongful act,
and that such activity would have indeed been profitable.

With those principles in mind, the question thus is whether in this case (i) it is
sufficiently certain that the Claimant would have made profits; and (ii) if yes, whether

the Claimant has provided the Tribunal with a reasonable basis to assess such loss of
profits. The two questions will be addressed in turn.

d. Has the Claimant proven the fact of future profitability?

877. In relation to the first question, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has indeed
proven the fact of future profitability. It is undisputed that Crystallex did not have a
proven track record of profitability, because it never started operating the mine.
However, in the Tribunal’s view, it has sufficiently established that, if it had been
allowed to operate, it would have engaged in a profitmaking activity and that such
activity would have been profitable. The Tribunal considers that this is essentially due
to the nature of the investment at stake here as well as the development stage of the
project.

878. First, it cannot be cast into doubt that Las Cristinas is one of the most important mines
in Latin America, and the Venezuelan authorities also clearly viewed it as such, !257
During the years in which it was active on the ground, Crystallex had completed the
exploration (drilling and testing) activities and the feasibility studies produced by the
Claimant (and approved by the Ministry of Mines) show that that the nature of the Las
Cristinas deposit was well known. In particular, the MDA 2007 Technical Report
confirmed that Las Cristinas had proven and probable reserves estimated at 16.86
million ounces of gold in situ, and measured and indicated resources of 20.76 million
ounces and inferred resources of 6.28 million ounces.'°* The Tribunal sees no reason
to cast into doubt the accuracy of the studies that those well-known consultants prepared
contemporaneously for the Claimant throughout the years.'**? As noted by the tribunal
in ADC v. Hungary, a business plan “constitutes the best evidence before the Tribunal
of the expectations of the parties at the time of expropriation for the expected stream of
cash flows”.!26

879. Furthermore, gold, unlike most consumer products or even other commodities, is less
subject to ordinary supply-demand dynamics or market fluctuations, and, especially in

Release, 5 November 2008, Exh. C-40, p. 2 (“Las Cristinas is considered one of Latin America’s most important

'259 The Tribunal further notes that, based on the mine expansion plans developed by Crystallex’s consultants, the
assumption that Crystallex would have been able to increase extraction from 20,000 tpd to 40,000 tpd in year 3 is
reasonable. See in particular SNC-Lavalin, 20,000 to 40,000 t/d Expansion Plan, October 2005, Exh. C-171,
Section 3.1.

the case of open pit gold mining as in Las Cristinas, is an asset whose costs and future
profits can be estimated with greater certainty. The Tribunal thus accepts that predicting
future income from ascertained reserves to be extracted by the use of traditional mining
techniques—as is the case of Las Cristinas—can be done with a significant degree of
certainty, even without a record of past production.'?6!

In short, the Claimant has established the fact of future profitability, as it had completed
the exploration phase, the size of the deposits had been established, the value can be
determined based on market prices, and the costs are well known in the industry and
can be estimated with a sufficient degree of certainty.

This conclusion leads the Tribunal to the second question, i.e., whether the Claimant
has provided the Tribunal with a reasonable basis to assess such loss of profits. This
issue relates to the choice of the appropriate methodology or methodologies to
determine the fair market value of Crystallex’s investment. In this respect, a first choice
to be made is whether it is more appropriate to adopt one or more of the Claimant’s
methodologies (which are all forward-looking, as they aim at calculating lost profits)
or the methodology propounded by the Respondent, namely the cost approach, which
is backward-looking and thus aimed at considering what the investor expended in the
project.

The Tribunal considers that in this case only forward-looking methodologies aimed at
calculating lost profits are appropriate in order to determine the fair market value of
Crystallex’s investment. By contrast, a backward-looking methodology such as the cost
approach, while susceptible of being utilized in certain instances where there is no
record of profitability and other methodologies would lead to excessively speculative
and uncertain results, cannot be resorted to in this case. The cost approach method
would not reflect the fair market value of the investment, as by definition it only
assesses what has been expended into the project rather than what the market value of
the investment is at the relevant time.

1261 See also Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 1CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award, 22
September 2014, Exh. CLA-185, para. 830, noting that:

“Claimant’s experts have modelled an alternative value based on a weighted average
of a DCF valuation, comparable publically traded company and comparables
transactions. A/though the Brisas Project was never a functioning mine and therefore
did not have a history of cashflow which would lend itself to the DCF model, the
Tribunal accepts the explanation of both Dr Burrows (CRA) and Mr Kaczmarek
(Navigant) that a DCF method can be reliably used in the instant case because of
the commodity nature of the product and detailed mining cashflow analysis
previously performed. The Tribunal also notes that the experts agreed on the DCF
model used, and it is only the inputs that are contested. Many of these have already
been discussed above, with the remaining variables discussed below.” (emphasis
added, internal footnote omitted)

242

883. | The appropriateness of choosing, at least for a case like this one, a method which aims
at determining lost profits and, by contrast, of discarding methods that are purely based
on the computation of sunk costs, is confirmed by the “Standards and Guidelines for
Valuation of Mineral Properties” by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and
Petroleum (“CIMVal Guidelines”), which are considered as important standards in the
industry.

884. | The CIMVal Guidelines define “development property” as “a Mineral Property that is
being prepared for mineral production and for which economic viability has been
demonstrated by a Feasibility Study or Prefeasibility Study and includes a Mineral
Property which has a Current positive Feasibility Study or Prefeasibility Study but
which is not yet financed or under construction’. It is undisputed that the Ministry of
Mines had approved Crystallex’s Feasibility Study on 6 March 2006. Las Cristinas
should thus be considered a “development property” within the meaning of the
Guidelines (as opposed to a less advanced “exploration property”).!?° In relation to
“development properties”, the CIMVal Guidelines advise in favor of the application of
income- and market-based methodologies, and against the use of cost-based
methodologies. !7°

885. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal will consider the Claimant’s four methodologies
to assess the fair market value of Crystallex’s investment and will assess whether the
Claimant has provided the Tribunal with a reasonable basis to assess lost profits.

e. The valuation methods

886. Valuation is not an exact science. There often is no single value of a business. Rather,
there are typically a range of values. Similarly, there is no one methodology best suited
for determining the fair market value of the investment lost in every situation. Tribunals
may consider any techniques or methods of valuation that are generally acceptable in
the financial community, and whether a particular method is appropriate to utilize is
based on the circumstances of each individual case. A tribunal will thus select the
appropriate method basing its decision on the circumstances of each individual case,
mainly because a value is less an actual fact than the expression of an opinion based on
the set of facts before the expert, the appraiser or the tribunal.

887. In this case, the Claimant has presented four valuation methodologies:

i. The stock market approach

'262 See Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Special Committee on Valuation. “Standards and
Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties”, February 2003, Exh. CLEX-74, p. 10 (defining “exploration
property” as “a Mineral Property that has been acquired, or is being explored, for mineral deposits but for which
economic viability has not been demonstrated”.)

 

 

!263 See Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Special Committee on Valuation. “Standards and
Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties”, February 2003, Exh. CLEX-74, p. 24.

243

ii. The P/NAV method
iii. The market multiples method
iv. The indirect sales comparison method

888. | The Tribunal will deal with them in turn. Thereafter, it will also come back to the cost
approach (v.), which is not considered for the purposes of the Tribunal’s assessment of
damages, but is presented for “informative” purposes only, in order to show the breadth
of the investments made by the Claimant.

i. The stock market approach

889. The Tribunal considers that in this particular case the stock market approach is a
particularly appropriate and reliable valuation method, due to the following reasons.

890. First, as a general matter, the stock market methodology reflects the market’s
assessment of the present value of future profits, discounted for all publicly known or
knowable risks (including gold prices, contract extensions, management, country risk,
etc.) without the need to make additional assumptions. In other words, the use of the
stock market approach eliminates the need to resort to such assumptions, as the market
factors in all risks and costs associated to the asset. The second reason why in this
particular case the stock market may be relied upon is that Crystallex was a one-asset
company and the rights which Crystallex enjoyed under the MOC in relation to Las
Cristinas were that single asset.'** Thus, any buyer acquiring the totality of
Crystallex’s shares would have acquired the entire value of Crystallex’s rights under
the MOC and would in principle have been interested foremost and possibly exclusively
in and valued the company on the basis of that single asset. Third, Crystallex’s stock
was actively and heavily traded on two main stock exchanges for mining companies!
so that transactions were occurring with sufficient frequency and sufficient volume to
provide pricing information on an ongoing basis that reflects the expectations of a
multitude of arm’s length buyers and sellers on the underlying value of the company.
Reciprocally, as the buyers do first think of the Claimant as a one-asset company, it is
obvious that the stock value will reflect that asset valuation. The Tribunal considers
that the stock market approach is thus a reliable method in this case. !7°°

as formed 99.97% of its total value in “Property, Plant and Equipment”).

compulsion to buy or sell. This constant repricing gives up-to-the-minute evidence of prices that buyers and sellers

891. To determine the value of Crystallex on 13 April 2008, the Tribunal must start with the
last price before the wrongful acts which negatively affected the company’s share price
and then calculate what would have been the value as of the valuation date if Crystallex
had been unimpeded by Respondent’s conduct. With regard to the “last clean date”, the
Tribunal also accepts the choice of 14 June 2007 as appropriate. This is the date when
Crystallex announced to the market that it had fulfilled the requirements for the issuance
of the Permit and that it had paid the necessary taxes and posted the requisite bond. The
Tribunal accepts that after 14 June 2007 the actual stock price of Crystallex became
affected by the absence of positive news on permitting, while the industry indexes
continued to grow until the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. The Tribunal further notes
that, beyond criticizing the use of the June 2007 date, the Respondent and its expert
have not suggested an alternative satisfactory date for these purposes.'?67 Furthermore,
the Tribunal accepts the “build-up” to 2008 performed by the Claimant’s experts which
tracks Crystallex’s actual share price movement up to the last trading date that was free
of any threat of unlawful act and then makes it evolve according to a relevant industry
index. For the Tribunal, such build-up is indeed appropriate to reflect a but-for

scenario, !6

892. | With regard to the index to be chosen for the build-up, the Tribunal considers the junior
mining index as the most appropriate in this case, as Crystallex could be considered a
“junior” mining company because at that stage it had only one major development stage
project in its portfolio, i.e. Las Cristinas. In this respect, the Tribunal does not agree
with the Claimant that reliance on the junior gold index would lead to an overly
conservative valuation.

893. Finally, the Tribunal considers that neither the “permitting bump” nor the “control
premium” should be considered in this case. With regard to the “permitting bump”, the
Tribunal considers its application unwarranted under the circumstances. The
Claimant’s reliance on Gold Reserve’s bump (as opposed to bumps possibly

agree on for securities in all kinds of industries relative to the fundamental variables perceived to drive their values,
such as dividends, cash flows and earnings’” (quoting S. Pratt et al., Valuing a Business: The Analysis and
Apprasial [sic] of Closely Held Companies (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000) 224-5).”); CLA-66 2008 S. Ripinsky
& K. Williams, Damages In International Investment Law, British Institute of International and Comparative Law
(2008), Exh. CLA-66, Exh. CLA-159, Exh. RLA-93, p. 189, fn. 25 (“Arbitral tribunals have acknowledged that
where the 's, and shares in particular, are publicly traded, stock market quote of the shares on the relevant date
would be an appropriate indicator of the fair market value.”). See also Quasar de Valores, SICAV, S.A., et al. v.

experienced also by other mining companies) is insufficient to warrant the permitting
bump sought and its size, especially since the Claimant had already received a 27%
increase in share price when Gold Reserve received its permit because the market
expected Crystallex would also be receiving its permit shortly thereafter. With regard
to the control premium, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant and its experts have
not sufficiently proven that its application is appropriate in this case. As the Claimant’ s
authorities point out, one of the main reasons for a control premium is that new
management will change the business strategy and thereby create value. In the
Tribunal’s view, the Claimant has not shown this to be the case and in fact it seems to
be inapplicable here. Moreover, the Respondent has argued that the MOC expressly
prohibited Crystallex from assigning directly or indirectly its rights and obligations
thereunder.'? Whether this prohibition equally applies to Crystallex’s shares (as
opposed to the investment itself) may be left open here. What appears likely is that
Venezuela might have raised objections (whether well-founded or not) to that transfer
and that might have made the sale of control more difficult and possibly reduced the
price. The Claimant also has not shown that it is appropriate to add a control premium
to compensate for an implied minority discount.

Finally, the Tribunal decides to reject the Claimant’s claim for US$ 180 million as
“consequential post-2008 damages”. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not
sufficiently established why those damages beyond the date of valuation chosen by the
Tribunal should be added, and in any event considers that they have not been
sufficiently detailed to be taken into account for these purposes.

In conclusion, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s stock market method, with the
adjustments made above, provides a reasonable and reliable basis to quantify the
Claimant’s damages as of April 2008. The application of the variables discussed above
leads to a figure of US$ 1,295.16 million.'?”° The Tribunal, having reviewed the figures
which result from the application of these variables, concludes that it sees no reason
why it should not accept the accuracy of the Claimant’s experts’ calculations in this
respect. Moreover, the Respondent’s expert, while challenging the inputs, did not
challenge the accuracy of the calculations made based on those inputs.

ii. The P/NAV method

A further method presented by the Claimant is the so-called P/NAV method. While the
Tribunal considers that conceptually it would have no difficulties in accepting it as a
method per se, it has come to the conclusion that, with respect to an April 2008
valuation date, the “valuation” presented by the Claimant and its experts cannot be
relied upon.

126 See MOC, Exh. C-9, Clause 20.

1279 See Third ER Lexecon, para. 34.

246

897.

898.

899.

It should be recalled that the Tribunal asked the Claimant to perform a new P/NAV
valuation with regard to an April 2008 valuation date and the use of a number of
variables.!?’! Having reviewed the new calculations provided by the Claimant’s experts
especially in view of their original February 2011 P/NAV valuation, the Tribunal
considers that such April 2008 calculations do not provide reliable data as the process
performed by the experts does not follow the methodology applied for their original
valuation, at least not identically. In particular, the Claimant’s experts have not selected
new comparable companies based on analyst reports as of 13 April 2008 from which
they would have obtained a new price multiple derived from the median of such
companies.

In the words of the Claimant:

“In order to employ alternative implied nominal discount rates within the
P/NAV method, as requested by the Tribunal, Prof. Spiller and Dr. Abdala
generated hypothetical (and counterfactual) P/NAV multiples consistent
with the implied nominal discount rates requested through the same reverse
process. In other words, in these alternative valuations, the experts first
conducted a DCF-style calculation, which is inappropriate for a gold project
but allows use of the implied nominal discount rates requested by the
Tribunal, and then, by the same process of trial and error, found the P/NAV
multiple that yielded the same numerical result as the results produced using
the implied nominal discount rates stipulated by the Tribunal”.'?”

The inadequacies of such “reverse engineering” process in relation to an April 2008
valuation have been particularly shown upon Venezuela’s cross-examination of the
Claimant’s experts at the Quantum Hearing.'2”> While the Tribunal does not cast into
doubt that the process followed by the Claimant’s experts in response to the Tribunal’s
questions may have been due to a good faith misunderstanding of the Tribunal’s
questions on the P/NAV valuation, the fact remains that, by the Claimant’s own
admission, the “running of the numbers” with regard to the 2008 valuation date
generates somewhat “artificial” and incomplete results,!2’4 which the Tribunal is thus
unable to consider for the purpose of its damage quantification. In view of this
conclusion, it is thus unnecessary to examine whether the Claimant could legitimately
substitute the P/NAV method to the more customary DCF approach and why the
Claimant did not supply a DCF calculation at all.

903.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal thus disregards the P/NAV method supplied by
the Claimant in respect of the April 2008 valuation date.

iii. The market multiples method

The third methodology proposed by the Claimant is the market multiples approach.
This is a valuation method that estimates the value of an asset or company by examining
the market valuation of companies holding properties of similar characteristics. It
derives a measure of value for the asset subject to valuation by inference from the value
of peer companies. The Tribunal considers that such method is widely used as a
valuation method of businesses, and can thus be safely resorted to, provided it is
correctly applied and, especially, if appropriate comparables are used. Also the
CIMVAL Guidelines confirm that market-based methodologies, such as this one, are
appropriate for the valuation of a development stage mineral property such as Las
Cristinas.!275

With regard to the application of this methodology to the specificities of this case, the
Tribunal is of the view that the valuation provided by the Claimant’s experts in relation
to the 13 April 2008 valuation date yields reliable results. In respect of this method, in
response to the Tribunal’s request the Claimant’s experts have undertaken to identify
new comparable companies as of 13 April 2008 in order to yield a market multiple
based upon Enterprise Value to Gold Reserves Equivalent (“EV/Resource”). In this
regard, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant and its experts have identified
sufficiently comparable companies to find their EV/Resource multiple. While the
Tribunal has noted the Respondent’s criticism that some of the 73 companies used as
comparables seem to bear little resemblance to Crystallex, no two companies will ever
be exactly alike. This is a given that must be accepted when using this kind of
methodology. After all, “to compare” is a process made with objects similar to the
subject rather than with identical objects—if those even exist.

With regard to the sensitivities discussed by the Parties, the Tribunal decides the
following. First, no control premium should be added, as the Claimant and its experts
have not sufficiently proven that its application is appropriate in this case. Second, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate to refer to a 20-year duration of the exploitation, which
is the base duration of the MOC, without renewals. The Tribunal has not been
convinced by the Claimant’s argument that a reasonable investor limited by a 20-year
contract would proceed to mine all the gold that is economically feasible to extract at
the prevailing gold price over the period of time available. The Tribunal first notes that
the MOC provides a duration of 20 years “extendable for one (1) or two (2) periods of
ten (10) years” “subject to the previous written agreement of the Parties” (previo

"275 See Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Special Committee on Valuation, “Standards and
Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties”, February 2003, Exh. CLEX-74, pp. 22-24.

acuerdo escrito entre las partes).'2"° Thus, there is no automatic right to further
renewals, and it cannot be simply assumed that either Party would have simply agreed
to renew the MOC, much less on identical or similar terms in the wake of changed
circumstances (for example in case of significant increase or decrease of gold prices).
The Tribunal thus considers that taking into account a 20-year duration, in line with the
MOC’s base duration, more accurately reflects the determination of the fair market
value of Crystallex’s investment.!2”7

As to the consequential post-2008 damages, the Tribunal refers to its earlier finding at
para. 894 which is also applicable in this instance.

The application of the market multiples method with the sensitivities discussed above
yields damages in the amount of US$ 1,109 million.'?”* The Tribunal, having reviewed
the figures that result from the application of these variables, concludes that it sees no
reason why it should not accept the accuracy of the Claimant’s experts’ calculations in
this respect. Moreover, the Respondent’s expert, while challenging the inputs, did not
challenge the accuracy of the calculations made based on those inputs.

iv. The indirect sales comparison method

The fourth and last valuation method presented by the Claimant is the market
transaction method (or indirect sales comparison approach) performed by Mr. Trevor
Ellis. This approach takes prior mine transactions which the Claimant and its expert
argue are indirectly comparable to a potential Las Cristinas transaction and then
develops a value for Las Cristinas based on a series of adjustments made to the prior
mine transactions.

The Tribunal has no difficulty in accepting that in theory such method could yield
reasonable results and would thus be an appropriate valuation method to value an
investment in an international arbitration. However, its particular application by the
Claimant’s expert presents uncertainties and speculative elements so that the Tribunal
cannot consider it in this particular case.

First, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Ellis’ valuations performed under the
“unconstrained scenarios” (i.e., processing 140,000 tpd for a majority of the project)
are based on too “aggressive” and unrealistic assumptions which find little, if any,
reflection in the Claimant’s own contemporaneous mining studies. The Tribunal notes

1276 MOC, Exh. C-9, Clause 18.1.

277 See also I. Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law, Oxford
University Press (2009), Exh. CLA-71, para. 5.166 (“If the contract provided for an extension only in the case of
an agreement between the parties, the arbitral tribunal usually did not include it in the valuation”, with further
references to cases).

218 Third ER Lexecon, para. 27.

249

909.

910.

911.

912.

that the Claimant itself did not include the valuations under these scenarios when
calculating its damages request.

With regard to the 40,000 tpd scenario (which is included in the Claimant’s damages
request), the Tribunal is of the view that the expert has not proven that the transactions
presented are sufficiently comparable to a potential Las Cristinas transaction. The
Tribunal notes that Mr. Ellis applies several adjustments to the allegedly comparable
transactions to make them more comparable to Las Cristinas. The Tribunal considers
that such adjustments are too plentiful to render this method of reliable value and that
the assessment of damages reached through such calculations is too speculative to be
taken into account.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal will disregard the indirect sales comparison
method presented by Mr. Ellis.

v. Cost approach

Before concluding on the valuation methods, the Tribunal wishes to briefly discuss the
figures which would result from the cost approach. The Tribunal has already explained
that in this case it does not consider it appropriate to resort to such method, as the fair
market value of an object is not related to its historical cost but to its future
performance.'?”” However, it presents the following comments for “informative”
purposes only, in order to show the breadth of the investments made by the Claimant
in relation to the Las Cristinas project.

In response to the Tribunal’s questions, the Claimant has provided the following
summary of the costs it has incurred. The final column (“Corrected”) incorporates
certain corrections made by the Claimant’s experts who have reviewed the Claimant’s
cost information. '?8°

costs should be excluded as they did not contribute to the project’s value,'?*! it cannot
be disputed that the Claimant expended hundreds of millions in the project.'?5

914. The Tribunal wishes in particular to note the large-scale investments made by
Crystallex in social projects in Venezuela, pursuant to its obligations under Clauses 7
and 12 of the MOC for the implementation of social programs for the benefit of the
communities surrounding Las Cristinas. Among other things, Crystallex provided
technical support for small-scale mining associations;'?*? it maintained and upgraded
the Las Claritas Medical Center;!* it built houses in the local communities;'7°> and
improved the potable water and sewage system.'?*° Indeed, on several occasions, the
CVG acknowledged that Crystallex had complied with its social projects obligations

f. Conclusion on the valuation methods

916. In conclusion, the Tribunal has found that the application of forward-looking
methodologies is appropriate to assess the fair market value of Crystallex’s investment,
for the reasons explained above. It has further reviewed the four methodologies
propounded by the Claimant, and has come to the conclusion that, for the valuation date
that it considers appropriate in this case (i.e., 13 April 2008), the stock market and the
market multiples approaches provide reliable bases upon which to value the Claimant’s
loss. By contrast, the P/NAV method does not appear to provide reliable figures in
relation to the April 2008 valuation date, and the indirect sales comparison method is
disregarded as its results here are excessively speculative.

917. | The Tribunal further notes that the damages assessed through the stock market and the
market multiples approaches amount to US$ 1,295.16 million and US$ 1,109 million
respectively. The two approaches thus lead to results which are largely consistent with
each other.'?”° Rather than opting for one methodology to the exclusion of the other,

"288 The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has insisted in its post-hearing submissions that certain costs, and in
particular the proceeds deriving from the sale of certain equipment, be subtracted from the figures which would
result from a cost approach valuation.

See R-PHB, paras 319-321 (where Venezuela, in the section devoted to the cost approach, argues that “[i]n any
event, under the Cost Approach, the use of proceeds for recovered costs is irrelevant—they are still subtracted from
the amount spent on ‘plant and equipment’ (which is part of the overall total) to accurately represent those costs”,
emphasis added); R-PHB, Annex, paras 108-109 and 116-119; R-Supplemental Quantum Submission, para. 85
(where Venezuela, in Section V devoted to the cost approach, submits that “[s]ince an accurate cost approach
analysis needs to account for the net costs, Mr. Hart deducts all identifiable non-prudent costs and costs that have
been or reasonably could be recovered by Claimant. These deductions include: (1) the amount Claimant recovered
by selling the mining equipment [...]”). See also Third ER Hart, Section V.B..

  

   

 

 

 

The Tribunal has decided to discard the cost approach so that it is unnecessary to further consider this issue.

289 Taking as an example the Claimant’s corrected figure of US$ 645 million, the cost approach would produce a
result that would not be entirely imilar to the valuations according to the forward-looking methods, particularly
if one were to add an appropriate rate of interest the Claimant would have paid on its disbursements from their
effective date. It is of course not possible to reintroduce through the backdoor a method that is found not to be fit
in the circumstances of the case. However, to ascertain that its results, albeit not as high as the figures resulting
from the forward-looking valuations, are not totally different either, is reassuring as a sort of indication of
reasonableness of the use of the latter methodologies. This observation would still hold true even if the Tribunal
were to disregard or deny certain cost items, as argued by the Respondent.

 

 

   

 

1290 See M. Kantor, Valuation for Arbitration: Compensation Standards, Valuation Methods and Expert Evidence
(2008), Exh. CLA-65, p. 27 (“Valuation methods are often complementary. If the valuations reached by two
methodologies are widely inconsistent with each other, that can be a strong signal something is awry. If several
valuation methods produce consistent results, arbitrators may take greater comfort from the valuations”). See also

the Tribunal decides to average the two figures out and assess the Claimant’s damages
in the amount of US$ 1,202 million.

The Tribunal is convinced that this figure represents a correct and reasonable
assessment of the fair market value of the Claimant’s investment. The result reached is,
in the Tribunal’s view, not speculative, but, if anything, may err on the conservative
side, especially given that the Tribunal has decided to discard the Claimant’s alleged
consequential damages as well as certain variables proposed by the Claimant (such as
the control premium, the permitting bump, or the further contract renewals beyond the
20 years) which would have increased the Claimant’s damages.

INTEREST
1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that an award of interest is an integral component of the full
reparation principle under customary international law!?*!, and that in any event
Venezuela agreed under Article VII(1) of the Treaty that compensation for
expropriations shall accrue interest from the date of expropriation at a “normal
commercial rate”.'?°? Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the award of interest is
clearly warranted under the circumstances of this case.'*

For the Claimant, a suitable commercial rate of interest should be a rate that reflects
commercial interest rates for U.S. dollar borrowing in Venezuela.!?4 According to the
Claimant, the nearest proxy is the rate at which Petréleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA)
pays interest on short term, Venezuelan U.S.-dollar bonds. Based on its valuation date
of 3 February 2011, the Claimant selects two short term bonds from 15 October 2010
and 28 June 2011 with a coupon rate of 8% per annum and maturity dates of 17
November 2013.'2°> By contrast, the application of a risk-free rate would be
inappropriate, because it would ignore the commercial reality that companies do not
raise capital through risk-free investments, and would thus result in serious under-
compensation to the Claimant.'?°°

methods, each one with its draw-backs. It is best — and that also seems to be the main current arbitral practice — to
apply a combination of the various methods and then try to narrow down the differences between the results of
application of each by understanding, assessing and judging the reasons for such differences”).

921. Furthermore, the Claimant contends that the only way to fully repair Crystallex for the
time value of its money and to avoid that Venezuela has a windfall for its wrongful act
is by the compounding of pre-award interest.'?°’ It submits that nearly every recent
damages investment treaty award has granted compound pre-award interest.!2°° With
regard to the periodicity of the compounding, the Claimant submits that interest should
be compounded semi-annually.

922. Finally, the Claimant seeks post-award interest.!7°? Crystallex asserts that it is entitled
to compound interest accruing on the Tribunal’s award from the date of the award until
payment is made in full, and that post-award interest removes any incentive by the
Respondent to delay compensation.'*° It thus claims post-award interest at a rate of
8% per annum from the date of the Tribunal’s award, compounded semi-annually.'*"!

2. The Respondent’s Position

923. First, the Respondent submits that there is no automatic entitlement to interest,!3? and
cites in this respect to Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.!°° It is for
the Tribunal to assess whether the circumstances warrant the award of interest, which
is not the case here.!3™*

924. Second, Venezuela contends that the Claimant’s proposed interest is out of line with
commercial reality and legal authority.'"°°° The suggested 8% rate is also
disproportionate if compared to the proposed discount rate of 5%.'>° Further, there is
no evidence that — either pre- or post-award — Crystallex would have used any awarded
amounts to purchase or invest in PDVSA bonds.'*°” By contrast, an interest rate based
on the U.S. risk-free rate, such as rates used in U.S. Treasury bills, would be appropriate
in this case.'*°* A conservative approach to interest is appropriate, because, Venezuela

contends, applying interest at anything other than the risk-free rate necessarily adopts
speculative assumptions about the nature and success of the investments that the
Claimant would have made, and would award the Claimant an unjustified risk
premium.!*

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the Claimant is not owed compound interest.
It contends that international courts and tribunals have consistently declined to award
compound interest, unless there are special reasons justifying such interest.'?!°
Venezuela does not dispute that there are instances where compound interest has been
awarded in investment treaty arbitrations, yet it submits that this practice is by no means
uniform.'?!! The relevant inquiry is whether there are any special circumstances
justifying the award of compound interest. The Claimant has failed to demonstrate that
the circumstances in this case warrant the award of compound interest.!>!*

 

Finally, according to the Respondent, post-award interest is also not justified, because
the Claimant has not established a risk that Venezuela will not pay an award.'3!
According to the Respondent, Venezuela has never defaulted on an arbitral award and
— should Venezuela not willingly pay the award — the Claimant would be in a position
to pursue its claim through any of the signatories of the 1958 Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.'3!+

3. Analysis

As recalled above, the Treaty vests the Tribunal with the power to award “monetary
damages and any applicable interest” in case of breach of an obligation contained in
the Treaty (Article XII(9) of the BIT).

The Tribunal finds that both pre-award and post-award interests are due.

With regard to pre-award interest, its function is to compensate the injured party for the
loss of its ability to benefit from the use of the principal compensation sum from the
date it fell due.

The substantive international legal obligation to pay interest on monies due is well
established. An authoritative statement of the position is to be found in Article 38(1) of
the ILC Articles:

“Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when
necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of
calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result”.

931. As noted in the commentary to Article 38, “[s]upport for a general rule favouring the
award of interest as an aspect of full reparation is found in international
jurisprudence”.!3!5

932. Indeed, an award of interest is an integral component of the full reparation principle
under international law, because, in addition to losing its property and other rights, an
investor loses the opportunity to invest funds or to pay debts using the money to which
that investor was rightfully entitled.'*'° In this case, due to Venezuela’s unlawful
conduct, Crystallex lost the opportunity to use the amount corresponding to the fair
market value of its expropriated investment to productive ends. The reparation should
address this loss of opportunity by virtue of awarding interest.

 

933. | With regard to the interest rate, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant’s proposed
rate, i.e. 8% per annum based on the coupon rate of bonds used by PDVSA. In the
Tribunal’s view, the Claimant has not proven that either pre- or post-award Crystallex
would have used any awarded amounts to purchase or invest in PDVSA bonds or, for
that matter, any instrument or investment producing a similar return.

934. In the Tribunal’s view, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the most
appropriate interest rate which will adequately compensate Crystallex is the 6-month
average U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 1 per cent per year at the valuation date.'*!” In the
Tribunal’s view, this approach approximates a commercially reasonable rate and
provides adequate compensation for the financial loss caused to a company engaged in
international business. At the hearing, experts of both sides confirmed that LIBOR plus
a certain percentage constituted a normal commercial rate in the circumstances.!3!*

Such interest shall start running from the date of valuation, i.e. 13 April 2008, until the
date of the Award.

935. | With regard to the issue of whether such interest should be simple or compound, the
Tribunal decides that such interest should be compound. The Tribunal acknowledges
that traditionally there was an inclination on the part of international tribunals to award
only simple interest.'*!? However, more recently, it has become increasingly recognized
that simple interest may not adequately ensure full reparation for the loss suffered and
the award of interest on a compound basis is therefore not excluded. This is because
modern financial activity normally involves compound interest. Thus, a judgment
creditor promptly placed in the possession of the funds due would be able to lend them
out or invest them at compound interest rates or, if forced to borrow as a result of the
respondent’s wrongful act, will do so at compound rates.'*?° Indeed, while arbitral case
law on this issue is not unanimous, the Tribunal is able to discern a clear trend in recent
decisions in favor of the award of compound interest.!7?!

1320 As explained by the tribunal in Wena v. Egypt, “[aln award of compound (as opposed to simple) interest is
generally appropriate in most modern commercial arbitrations [...] ‘If the claimant could have received compound

In conclusion, in the Tribunal’s view, awarding compound interest comes closer to
achieving the purpose of full reparation than simple interest.

As to the periodicity, the Tribunal opts for compounding on a yearly basis.

Thus, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal awards interest on the principal sum
awarded, compounded annually, at the rate of the 6-month average U.S. Dollar LIBOR
plus one percent, which shall accrue from 13 April 2008 until the date of the Award.

With regard to post-award interest, the Tribunal also considers that awarding such
interest is appropriate under the circumstances. It agrees with the observation made by
the tribunal in Aucoven v. Venezuela, whereby “post-award interest is intended to
compensate the additional loss incurred from the date of the award to the date of final

payment”, !3??

The Respondent shall thus pay post-award interest on the total amount of damages,
compounded annually, at the rate of the 6-month average U.S. Dollar LIBOR plus one
percent, from the date of the Award until full payment.

TAX

1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that the valuations set out in the Compass Lexecon and Ellis
Reports have been prepared net of Venezuelan tax. Consequently, any taxation by
Venezuela of the eventual award in this arbitration would, Crystallex submits, result in
the Claimant being effectively taxed twice for the same income.!??3

The Claimant therefore requests that the Tribunal declare that (i) any award be made
net of all applicable Venezuelan taxes and (ii) Venezuela may not tax or attempt to tax
the award. '3%4

The Claimant also seeks a tax indemnity for taxes imposed by Canada. It justifies its
request by describing possible taxes in Canada as a “consequential damage” that may
have to be paid by Crystallex but for Venezuela’s alleged treaty breaches.!??>

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent objects to the Claimant's tax indemnity requests. According to the
Respondent, the Claimant provides “no legal support for its unusual request” and fails
to explain what taxes would be applicable. Such claim should thus be rejected as
premature and speculative.!*?°

The Respondent further submits that the Claimant has not provided any evidence that
the award would be subject to double tax liability and argues that “Venezuela cannot
provide an indemnity against Canadian taxes because it cannot control or influence the

taxation decisions of another sovereign State”.!??”

3. Analysis

With regard to the Claimant’s request that the Tribunal declare that any award be made
net of all applicable Venezuelan taxes and Venezuela may not tax or attempt to tax the
award, the Tribunal takes note that the Claimant’s experts have indicated that their
quantum calculations have been prepared net of Venezuelan tax. Faced with a similar
request, the tribunal in Occidental v. Ecuador deemed such request “speculative and
premature”.'??8 This Tribunal likewise considers such request to be premature and thus
denies the Claimant’s request.

With respect to the Claimant’s request for tax indemnity for taxes imposed by Canada,
the Claimant has not established that the award would be subject to such tax liability.
Nor has the Claimant sufficiently proved that it would have suffered a distinct and
foreseeable loss from any tax imposed by Canada for which Venezuela rather than the
Claimant itself should be held liable. Without any need to examine Venezuela’s other
arguments, which may not be without justification, the request is accordingly denied.

Ix. COSTS

948. Both Parties request an award of costs in respect of the legal fees and expenses and the
costs of arbitration incurred in connection with this proceeding and have filed
submissions quantifying their fees and costs.'*??

949. The Claimant’s legal fees and expenses amount to US$ 30,493,635.'*° The Claimant
has advanced US$ 1,000,000 on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of
the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses. The Claimant seeks an
award of the entirety of these costs and interest at a reasonable commercial rate from
the date at which such costs were incurred until the date of payment by the
Respondent.!33!

950. The Respondent’s legal fees and expenses amount to US$ 14,322,826.'> It has
advanced US$ 974,750 on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of the
Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses. The Respondent seeks an
award of the entirety of these costs (or a least of the costs incurred for the supplemental
quantum procedure) and interest from the date at which such costs were incurred until
the date of payment by the Claimant.!?*3

951. Both sides argue that a costs award is warranted because a prevailing party is entitled
to such an award under the principle of costs follow the event, and because the other
party has conducted the arbitration in a manner which has led to delay and increased
costs.

952. In particular, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal should take into account the
following factors in allocating costs in favor of the Claimant: (i) Venezuela’s proposal
for the disqualification of its originally appointed arbitrator;!*** (ii) Venezuela’s

“fabrication” of the Technical Inspection Report (or “Romero Report”);!**° and (iii)
Venezuela’s failure to produce timely the CITIC Studies Agreement.'**°

For its part, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should take into account the
following factors in allocating costs in favor of the Respondent: (i) the Claimant’s
refusal to provide certain information on a plausible damages theory or information to
support an April 2008 valuation date, which triggered the supplemental procedure on
quantum that the Tribunal ordered after post-hearing briefs were exchanged;'**” (ii) the
Claimant’s insistence on raising various irrelevant issues and arguments (such as the
Rusoro PowerPoint, the CITIC document request and arguments, the “Empresa
Nacional Aurffera” transaction, and the introduction of the Gold Reserve award);!338
(iii) the Claimant’s untimely introduction of evidence.'**?

The Tribunal has the power to determine and allocate the costs of the arbitration
pursuant to Article XII(9) of the Treaty, which provides that the Tribunal “may also
award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules”.!*#° Article 52(1)(j) of
the ICSID Additional Facility Rules provides that the award shall contain “any decision
of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding”. Article 58 further provides that:

“(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by
whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses
and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end,
call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the information it
needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the proceeding between
the parties.

(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall
form part of the award.”

As the Parties have not agreed otherwise, the Tribunal is vested with the authority to
decide the allocation of costs in this arbitration. The applicable rules just mentioned
grant it considerable discretion in this respect.

Two main approaches may be distinguished in awarding costs in investment treaty

arbitrations. Some tribunals apportion ICSID costs where they were incurred and rule
that each party should bear its own costs. Others apply the principle “costs follow the

event”, making the losing party bear all or part of the costs of the proceedings, including
those of the prevailing party.

As evidenced by the foregoing sections of this Award, there were numerous procedural
issues and difficult substantive legal questions involved at the various phases of the
arbitration. Many of these issues were far from clear-cut and involved meritorious
arguments by both Parties.

While the Claimant has ultimately prevailed on jurisdiction and, in part, the merits, the
Respondent’s defenses were not frivolous, but quite to the contrary serious, and a
number of its positions were accepted by the Tribunal.

Furthermore, none of the facts that would clearly justify cost allocation (such as bad
faith, abusive or unreasonable argument, or obstructions tactics) was present in this
arbitration. To the contrary, each side presented valid arguments in support of its
respective case and acted fairly and professionally. In particular, the extensive
pleadings of both Parties greatly assisted the Tribunal in its task.

Having considered all these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that each Party
should bear its own costs and the Parties should equally share the ICSID costs.!*4! In
this latter respect, it is noted that the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a
statement of the case account in due course.

'4! This result is also in accordance with the well-settled public international law practice in this respect.
