Ill. SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. Arbitration Agreement and Institution of the Proceedings

5. This arbitration concerns a legal dispute between Vigotop and Hungary arising out of
Vigotop’s investment in KC Bidding Kft. (“KC Bidding”)! and King City Manage-
ment Kft. (“KC Management”),” through which Vigotop held rights in the King’s
City Project (the “Project”), including the Concession Contract between Hungary, rep-

' KC Bidding is a company established under the laws of Hungary on 3 December 2008, and registered on
4 December 2008, formed as the company through which Claimant could participate in a tender by Hungary for
a concession for the establishment and operation of a mega-casino. The call for tender required that a minimum
25% of the shares in the concession receiver be held, directly or indirectly, by a partner with experience in
organizing games of chance in Hungary or abroad. This requirement was fulfilled by the participation of 21°
Century Resorts a.s. trading as American Chance Casinos (“ACC”). ACC holds 25% of the shares in KC Bid-
ding; Claimant holds 75%. ACC is a subsidiary of Trans World Corporation (“TWC”), a NASDAQ-listed
company. Memorial, {| 17 and 56.

> Claimant holds 100% of the shares in KC Management, which was incorporated in Hungary on 5 November
2007 and registered on 12 November 2007. On 26 January 2010, Claimant acquired KC Management as a
company for the construction of the King’s City Project. Memorial, | 19. Vigotop acquired the shares of KC
Management from another Cypriot company, Sabase Holdings Limited, whose ultimate shareholders are the
same as those of Vigotop. KC Management was created to manage the local affairs of the King’s City Project,
specifically, to control the construction phase of the Project. Gaye I, {| 14.

resented by the Minister of Finance, and KC Bidding, dated 9 October 2009 (the
“Concession Contract”). Claimant alleges that Respondent violated the Agreement

between the Government of the Hungarian People’s Republic and the Government of

the Republic of Cyprus on Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investment (the “Cy-

prus-Hungary BIT” or the “Treaty”), which entered into force on 24 May 1989, by

taking a series of unlawful measures, culminating in the termination of the Concession

Contract, which allegedly amounted to an expropriation of Claimant’s investment

without compensation, in violation of Article 4 of the Treaty.

Article 4 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT provides:

“1, Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, di-
rectly or indirectly, investors of the other Party of their investments
unless the following conditions are complied with:

(a) The measures are taken in the public interest and under due pro-
cess of law;

(b) the measures are not discriminatory;

(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of

just compensation.

2. The amount of compensation must correspond to the market value
of the expropriated investments at the moment of the expropriation.

3. The amount of this compensation may be estimated according to
the laws and regulations of the country where the expropriation is
made.

4. The compensation must be paid without undue delay upon comple-
tion of the legal expropriation procedure, but not later than three
months upon completion of this procedure and shall be transferred in
the currency in which the investment is made. In the event of delay
beyond the three-months’ period, the Contracting Party concerned
shall be liable to the payment of interest based on prevailing rates.

5. Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer losses of their in-
vestments in the territory of the other Contracting State due to war
or other armed conflict or state of emergency in the territory of the
other Contracting Party, shall be treated, with respect to the com-
pensation for these losses, as investors of any third State.”

Claimant has invoked the arbitration provisions in Article 7 of the Cyprus-Hungary

BIT providing for arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Invest-

ment Disputes (“ICSID”). Article 7 of the Treaty provides as follows:

Award Page -4-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

“1, Any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of
the other Contracting Party concerning expropriation of an invest-
ment shall, as far as possible, be settled by the disputing parties in an
amicable way.

2. If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date
either party requested amicable settlement, it shall, upon request of
the investor, be submitted to one of the following:

(a) The Arbitration Institute of the Arbitral Tribunal of the
Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm;

(b) the Arbitral Tribunal of the International Chamber of Com-
merce in Paris;

(c) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Dis-
putes in case both Contracting Parties have become members
of the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of In-
vestment Disputes between States and other Nationals of
Other States.”

On 18 July 2011, Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration (“RfA”), together with
Exhibits, with the Secretary-General of ICSID in accordance with Article 36 of the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
other States (the “ICSID Convention”) and the Rules of Procedure for the Institution
of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Institution Rules”).

On 19 July 2011, the Secretariat of ICSID (the “Secretariat”) transmitted the RfA to
Respondent.

On 4 August 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID (the “Secretary-General”) regis-
tered the RfA in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6 and
7 of the ICSID Institution Rules and notified the Parties of such registration. The case
was assigned the ICSID Case Number ARB/1 1/22.

On 11 October 2011, Claimant informed the Secretariat that Respondent had agreed to
the number and method of appointment of arbitrators proposed in the RfA, namely that
the Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be ap-
pointed by each Party and the third arbitrator, the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, to
be appointed by agreement of the Parties. On the same day, Claimant appointed Mr.
Doak Bishop, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator.

On 17 October 2011, Mr. Doak Bishop accepted his appointment as arbitrator, having
provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accordance with Rule 6(2) of

Award Page -5-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration
Rules’).

13. On 27 October 2011, Respondent appointed Dr. Veijo Heiskanen, a national of Fin-
land, as arbitrator.

14. On 1 November 2011, Dr. Veijo Heiskanen accepted his appointment as arbitrator,
having provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accordance with Rule
6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

15. On 16 December 2011, Claimant addressed the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative
Council, through the Secretary-General, with a request to appoint an arbitrator to be
the President of the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Con-
vention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, noting than more than 90 days
had elapsed since registration of the RfA and the Tribunal had not yet been constituted.

16. On 6 January 2012, the Acting Secretary-General proposed to the Parties three candi-
dates for President of the Tribunal, requesting that the Parties indicate their agreement
to one or more of the candidates by way of secret ballot.

17. On 18 January 2012, the Secretariat informed the Parties that they had agreed on the
appointment of Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs as President of the Tribunal.

18. On 19 January 2012, Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs accepted his appointment as President of
the Tribunal, having provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accord-
ance with Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

19. On 19 January 2012, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Prof. Dr. Klaus
Sachs, Mr. Doak Bishop and Dr. Veijo Heiskanen had accepted their appointments as
arbitrators and, accordingly, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the
Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun as of
such date; in addition, Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu was designated to serve as the Secre-
tary (the “Secretary”) of the Tribunal.

Florista Holdings Limited 50%;

Pereg Holdings LLC 16.67%."

The individual shareholders of Florista Holdings Ltd, RSL Capital LLC, Ride Hold-
ings LLC and Pereg Holdings LLC respectively are Messrs. Yoav Blum, Ronald S.
Lauder and Fred H. Langhammer, and Mr. and Mrs. Itzhak Fisher. Messrs. Blum,
Lauder, Langhammer and Fisher are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Project

Sponsors”.'*

Political Circumstances

At the time Claimant decided to locate the Project in Hungary, the governing political
party in Hungary was the Magyar Szocialista Party (MSZP), led by Prime Minister
Ferenc Gyurcsany, 'S who had been re-elected in April 2006.'°

On 21 March 2009, Mr. Gyurcsany announced his intention to resign as Prime Minis-
7
ter.

On 14 April 2009, an interim administration was formed to govern until the next na-
tional elections, which were to be held in April 2010. This government was led by Mr.
Gordon Bajnai, former Minister of Local Government and Regional Development and
former Minister of National Development. 1s

In the April 2010 Hungarian elections, the Fidesz Party came to power with a two-
thirds majority in the Hungarian Parliament. On 29 May 2010, Dr. Viktor Orban, the
leader of the Fidesz Party, was elected by the Parliament as Prime Minister. 9

C. From the Inception of the Project to the Conclusion of the Concession Contract
1. Inception of the Project

88. The Project was intended by Claimant to be “one of Europe’s premier tourist destina-
tions”: a resort consisting of a mega-casino, three luxury hotels and various attractions
including amusement theme parks, spa facilities, a skating rink, botanical gardens, a
museum, an aquarium, a concert hall, conference facilities and a golf course.”°

89. Having identified Hungary as a potential location for the Project, Mr. Blum and Mr.
Lauder met on 31 August 2007 with Mr. Bajnai, Respondent’s then Minister for Local
Government and Regional Development, and Dr. Abel Garamhegyi, State Secretary
for the Ministry of National Development and Economy, in Budapest in order to intro-
duce them to the Project. Following the meeting, Minister Bajnai expressed his support
for the Project and offered his Ministry’s assistance in establishing the Project in Hun-
gary.2!

90. In a subsequent meeting on 17 September 2007, Minister Bajnai met with Messrs.
Blum, Langhammer and Fisher, as well as Mr. Gal Gaye, then CFO to the Project,”?
and Dr. Karoly Bard, Mr. Blum’s legal advisor and later head of KC Bidding’s legal
team.” Minister Bajnai offered support for the Project by (i) appointing Mr. Roland
Manyai as a liaison between the authorities involved and the Project Sponsors; and
stating that (ii) he considered the Project to be eligible for special project status; (iii)
the Government would invest in infrastructure in the vicinity of the Project; and (iv)
the Government would be willing to discuss a grant of exclusivity for the gaming con-
cession.4

2. Potential Site Locations: From Albertirsa and Pilis to Sukoré

91. The Project Sponsors initially planned to locate the Project in the Central Hungary
region? where Mr. Blum had purchased land plots 0188/2 and 0188/3 in Albertirsa
(the “Albertirsa Land”) in 2007”° and had entered into a preliminary agreement to

purchase land plot 0188/2 in Pilis (the “Pilis Land’) in 2008.77 Following consultation
with their advisors and financiers, however, the Project Sponsors ultimately decided
not to realize the Project in the Central Hungary region.”*

92. In spring 2008, Mr. Blum identified several plots of land in Sukoré in the Central
Transdanubian region (the “Sukor6 Site”) as a potential site for the Project.”” The Su-
kor6 Site was owned by Respondent and administered by the Hungarian State Holding
Company (the “MNV”).*° It was located on the shores of Lake Velence, approximate-
ly 55 kilometers from Budapest International Airport.*!

3. Land Swap Transaction

93. On 6 May 2008, Dr. Bard wrote to Mr. Miklés Tatrai, the CEO of the MNV, regarding
the utilization of the Sukor6 Site, in terms of exploring options for acquiring the land
by way of purchase, asset management agreement, lease, exchange, etc. During the
negotiations, it was agreed that Mr. Blum would acquire the Sukoré Site by way of a
land swap agreement with Respondent.** Under the terms of such land swap agree-
ment, Mr. Blum would exchange the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land for the Sukoré
Site, consisting of 19 properties under the ownership of the State and a 20" property to
be formed, and pay any difference in value between the properties at Sukor6 and his
own properties to the MNV.™ Under Hungarian law, the alienation of State-owned ar-
able land can only be performed through a public tender, unless it is the State that
wishes to acquire the land “for the purposes of public utility infrastructure projects or
for some other reason of public interest,” in which case a land swap is possible.**

94. On 9 June 2008, the MNV contacted the Hungarian National Infrastructure Depart-
ment (the “NIF”) to ask whether the tract of the main road number 4 would pass
through the properties at Albertirsa outskirts plots number 0188/2 and 0188/3 and Pilis
outskirts plot number 0188/2.°° On 16 June 2008, the NIF confirmed to the MNV that
“the Monor-Pilis by-pass section of main road 4 touches the real estates of Albertirsa

0188/2 and Pilis 0188/2”, it did not mention Albertirsa plot 0188/3.°” On 29 July 2008,

the NIF informed the MNV that the road project would affect all three of Mr. Blum’s
38

plots.

95. In January 2008, the MNV had instructed Perfekting Kft. (“Perfekting’”) to value the
Albertirsa Land, the Pilis Land and the Sukoré Site.” Perfekting was a specialized
valuation company which had won a public tender process to prepare valuations for the
MNV.

96. On 3 July 2008, Perfekting issued its final valuations of the properties involved in the
land swap, as follows:

(i) The Sukoré Site — HUF 1,085,259,750;"°
(ii) The Albertirsa Land — HUF 382,600,000;*! and
(iii) The Pilis Land — HUF 404,800,000.”

97. Based on the valuation carried out by Perfekting, the MNV determined that the land
swap could proceed on the basis that Mr. Blum pay the difference in value between the
two sets of properties in the amount of HUF 296,610,000 (approximately EUR 1.2 mil-
lion).

98. On 30 July 2008, the National Asset Management Council (the “NVT”), which is the
executive council and supreme decision-making organ of the MNV, responsible for

ing as representative of the Hungarian State, and Mr. Blum (the “Land Swap Agree-
ment”).*°

On 12 December 2008, the MNV, acting on behalf of the Hungarian State, issued a
declaration assenting to the registration of Mr. Blum as the purchaser of the 20 Sukoré
properties under the Land Swap Agreement (the “Registration Authorization’).“°

Mr. Blum was ultimately not registered by the Székesfehérvar Land Registry Office as
the owner of the 20 Sukor6 properties because a mandatory “tract formation” process
failed to be properly completed.*” Tract formation was necessary for four plots of the
Sukor6 Site as Respondent was required by Hungarian law to retain ownership of a 10-
meter-wide lakeshore strip of land within the Sukoré Site.** The procedure was re-
quired to be initiated by the MNV, and the State organs were responsible for properly
registering the title.”

With regard to the 16 properties that were not directly affected by the tract formation
procedure, on 12 February 2009, the MNV, acting on behalf of the State, and Dr.
Balint Varga, a Hungarian attorney acting on behalf of Mr. Blum, signed handing over
minutes transferring physical possession of these properties to Mr. Blum (the “Hando-
ver Protocol”).~°

On 26 February 2009, the MNV and Mr. Blum submitted a joint declaration requesting
that the Land Registry Office register Mr. Blum’s ownership of the 16 plots unaffected
by the tract formation procedure.*! Both the Land Registry Office as first instance and,
later, the Fejér County Court as second instance rejected the joint declaration on the
grounds that partial fulfillment, i.e., registration of Mr. Blum’s ownership of only16
instead of all 20 plots, could only have been possible if the swap contract had been
amended by the parties to stipulate that partial fulfillment was possible.

of Mr. Blum would be swapped.

On 8 May 2009, Mr. Blum and KC Bidding entered into a lease agreement, granting
KC Bidding a 24-year lease over four of the 16 Sukor6 properties that were not affect-
ed by the tract formation procedure (the “Leased Real Properties”), with an option to
extend the term for an additional 10 years (the “Lease Agreement”).

On 13 May 2009, the MNV issued a declaration confirming that Mr. Blum had paid
the value difference between the exchanged properties and had fulfilled his other obli-
gations arising out of the Land Swap Agreement, and that the properties not affected
by the tract formation procedure had been transferred to the possession of Mr. Blum.

Incentives and Special Project Status
Financial Incentives

On 9 October 2008, Mr. Gyérgy Rétfalvi, CEO of ITD Hungary Zrt., the Hungarian
Investment and Trade Development Agency (“ITD Hungary’), informed Mr. Blum,
as Chairman of KC Management, that the Government understood that the company
was planning to establish a tourist attraction in Sukoré with a value of EUR 951.4 mil-
lion, thereby creating 2,326 new jobs between 2008-2012. On that basis, as Mr. Ré-
tfalvi explained, Hungary was willing to offer KC Management financial incentives in
order to support the realization of this investment in Hungary. The Government’s sub-
sidy proposal consisted of a non-refundable direct incentive for the creation of a tourist
attraction project, in the value of HUF 2,000 million (which was increased to HUF
2,600 million in December 2008);°° a non-refundable direct incentive for employee
training up to a value of EUR 1 million; and a corporate tax allowance.” This offer
constituted a “conditional commitment’ of the Hungarian Government and was valid
for three months.*’ The offer provided that an incentive agreement defining the terms
and conditions of the support should be concluded between the Ministry for National
Development and Economy and KC Management, in which certain basic obligations
would be defined according to the predicted figures for realization of the investment,
financial guarantees and the number of jobs created and maintained.

107. KC Management asked for additional time to consider the proposal. The validity of the
offer was initially extended until 30 June 2009 and then to 31 August 2009.°

108. On 6 April 2009, Dr. Anita Buzds of ITD Hungary informed Mr. Gaye, then CFO and
Acting CEO of Claimant, of the procedure to be followed prior to execution of the in-
centive agreement, including the requirement of Governmental approval.

109. On 5 August 2009, Messrs. Gaye and Blum and Mr. Blum’s Hungarian lawyer, Dr.
Varga, met with Dr. Buzas and Mr. Gabor Pusztai of ITD Hungary to discuss the terms
of the incentive agreement. At that meeting, Mr. Blum, on behalf of KC Management,
and Dr. Buzas and Mr. Pusztai, on behalf of ITD Hungary, signed a protocol setting
out the key terms of the incentive agreement, including the topographical numbers for
the real estate in Sukor6 affected by the investment. The protocol specified that “any
support can be provided only if the real estates are free, clear and unencumbered.”*!

b) Special Project Status

110. On 30 October 2008, in response to a suggestion made by Ms. Kamilla Szandrocha,
Director for Incentives & After Care at ITD Hungary, Mr. Gaye applied to ITD Hun-
gary for special project status for the “King’s City Project to be located in Lake Ve-
lence,” attaching the King’s City site plans with plot numbers.”

111.

On 10 April 2009, the Project was awarded special project status under Act LIII of
2006 on the acceleration and simplification of the implementation of investment pro-
jects of particular importance for the national economy (“Special Project Status”).
This act aimed to attract foreign investment in Hungary by reducing the administrative
formalities for the implementation of such investments.“ The Government Decree, by
which Special Project Status was awarded to the Project, related to the procedures re-
quired for the implementation of the Project “in the outskirts of the community of Su-
koro” and listed the relevant topographical lot numbers.® The Government Decree an-
nexed the list of official permits required for the implementation of the Project, and

designated certain authorities as competent authorities, and others as specialist authori-

Land Swap Investigations

On 5 June 2009, following Mr. Gyurcsany’s resignation in March 2009 and in re-
sponse to questions being raised in Parliament and in the media about the Sukoré
transaction, Prime Minister Bajnai requested that the Minister of Finance, Dr. Péter
Oszk6, conduct an investigation into whether (i) “the [...] swap transaction was legit-
imate”; (ii) “the value determined by [Perfekting] of the real properties was propor-
tional’; and (iii) “the state party and its agents were acting legitimately when deter-
mining the values.”*" In addition, in mid-2009, the State Prosecutor’s Office initiated a
criminal investigation into the land swap transaction, and the State Audit Office, an in-
dependent body which audits the management of public funds and State property,°*
audited the land swap procedure.

The NVT Investigation

On 8 June 2009, Dr. Tamas Katona, State Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, con-
tacted Dr. Janos Nagy, President of the NVT, instructing him to lead the investigation
requested by Prime Minister Bajnai.”” On 17 June 2009, Dr. Janos Nagy reported his

findings to the Ministry of Finance.”!

He first described the applicable statutory
framework and explained the circumstances in which the Land Swap Agreement had
been approved by the relevant authorities.”* He then noted that, consistent with the ap-
plicable legislation, Perfekting had been appointed by the MNV to perform the valua-
tion of the properties in Sukoré, Pilis and Albertirsa, and that there “ha[d] been no
doubt on our behalf with regard to the well-groundedness of the value appraisals”
with regard to the Land Swap Agreement.” Finally, he explained that other State bod-
ies, including the NIF and the Central Transdanubia Environmental and Water Direc-
torate, had also been consulted and did not object to the transaction.

On 1 July 2009, in response to questions from Dr. Oszk6, Dr. Janos Nagy submitted a
detailed report to Dr. Oszk6, confirming that the Land Swap Agreement was legal.”
Dr. Janos Nagy opined that the transaction qualified as a mixed contract (i.e., a combi-
nation of a swap and a sale), which was valid under Hungarian law only if supported
by a public-interest objective. He confirmed that this public interest requirement was
met in light of the contemplated road development project on the Albertirsa Land and
the Pilis Land.”°

Internal Investigation of the Ministry of Finance

As it was the NVT that had initially approved the Sukoré transaction before the Land
Swap Agreement was concluded and might therefore have had a vested interest in the
outcome of any investigation regarding the Agreement’s validity, the Asset Manage-
ment Department within the Ministry of Finance also undertook directly to review the
land swap transaction. The internal investigation of the Ministry of Finance was super-
vised by Dr. Eva Kovacsné Egedi, head of the Asset Management Department.”

On 17 July 2009, Dr. Egedi submitted an internal memorandum to Dr. Oszk6 in which
she confirmed that the “legitimate nature of the legal transaction cannot be questioned
in a substantiated manner” but noted that neither her department nor the MNV was
able to justify with certainty that the entire territory of the Pilis Land and Albertirsa
Land was required for the construction of the road project.”* She concluded that the le-
gitimacy of the swap could not “be warranted beyond any doubt” and that there was a
risk that, if it were established that the contract did not satisfy, or violated, the relevant
legislative provisions, this might result in the transaction being deemed “null and
void.””

Dr. Egedi noted that the Ministry of Finance did not consider itself to be competent to
comment upon the Perfekting valuation.*”

On 16 July 2009, Dr. Oszk6 communicated the findings of his internal investigations
81

to Prime Minister Bajnai,” stating that “it is not possible to question the legal nature

S

of the transaction in a well-grounded manner.” He expressed the opinion that the
procedure carried out by the MNV was in accordance with the provisions of the rele-
vant legislation in force but that he could not decide the question whether the public-
interest objective was fulfilled in respect of the whole transaction, “namely the whole
land area acquired by the state and whether such a requirement can be derived at all

from the legislative provisions.”

Investigation of the Prosecutor’s Office

The Chief Prosecutor’s Office initiated™ criminal investigations into the MNV’s valu-
ation of Mr. Blum’s properties at Albertirsa and Pilis and, on 17 June 2009, appointed
TREVISO Mérnoki Iroda Kft (“Treviso”), a valuation company, to determine the
market value of these properties. *°

Internal Investigation of the MNV

In September 2009, Ms. Timea Krisdnszky, a judicial expert appointed by the MNV,
issued a report on her review of the valuation of the Albertirsa Land, the Pilis Land and
the Sukoré Site prepared by Perfekting. She concluded that the evaluation had been
conducted in a methodologically correct manner, such that the “course and steps of the
calculation and the calculations themselves are controllable and correct’ and that “in
the whole the evaluation is good.”*®

2008 Report of the Hungarian State Audit Office

On 14 July 2009, the State Audit Office sent a draft report to the MNV which was

In its annual report for 2008, which was issued in August 2009 and was publicly avail-
able,** the State Audit Office expressed the view that the Land Swap Agreement was
“null and void,”®? under Section 200(2) of the Hungarian Civil Code, on the grounds
that “the aim of public interest, stipulated in section (4) of §13 of the NFA act, did not
exist for the total area of the exchange real estates.”°° The construction of the M4 mo-
torway had been stated to be the public-interest objective, but the report noted that only
5.63% of the properties swapped in Pilis and Albertirsa would have been required for
the construction. In addition, there was a significant difference between the land value
given by the Regional chief clerk of Pest County and the value taken into account in

the exchange, which could affect the setoff values of the real estate in Sukoré.”!

Tender for the Casino Concession

On 10 February 2009, the Ministry of Finance published a call for tenders for the con-
clusion of a concession contract regarding the establishment and operation of a Class I
casino in the Central-Transdanubian Region (the “Tender’”). The Tender included the
Sukoré Site.”

On 13 May 2009, KC Bidding submitted its tender application for the construction and
operation of a Class I casino in the Central-Transdanubian Region to the Ministry of
Finance, providing for the Project location to be the Sukoré Site.*

After reviewing KC Bidding’s tender application, the Application Assessment Com-
mittee of the Ministry of Finance concluded in its decision proposal of 27 July 2009
that KC Bidding’s application was valid in both content and form. The Committee rec-
ommended the announcement of KC Bidding as the winner of the Tender but noted
that the ownership status of the Sukoré Site was “still not fully settled” and that inves-
tigations were underway.”

On 4 August 2009, Mr. Csaba Arvai, Head of the Main Department of Sectoral Devel-
opment and Financing within the Ministry of Finance, sent a memorandum to Dr.
Oszk6 in which he discussed the Application Assessment Committee’s report and the
advantages and disadvantages associated with accepting or rejecting KC Bidding’s ap-

7. Parallel Discussions regarding the Land Swap Agreement

128. On 4 September 2009, immediately following the issuance of the State Audit Office

report at the end of August 2009,°’ Dr. Oszké wrote to Mr. Blum as follows:

“As it is known to you, the swap transaction related to the Sukoré
properties has given rise to significant negative reactions on behalf
of the general public in the recent weeks. Moreover, several specific
legal concerns have occurred with regard to the property swap
which has also been objected to recently by the Hungarian State Au-
dit Office in the recent past. With regard to the above, I consider a
review of the recent events necessary because, it is my well-grounded
opinion that an investment project which is granted special treatment
from the aspect of national economy can only be implemented if it is
done without any objections pertaining to prevailing law and the
public opinion.

Tam of the opinion that in the present situation, we need to find a so-
lution for the legal concerns and those raised by the general public
in relation to the property swap transaction. With regard to the latter
and considering the fact that even the State Audit Office considered
the property swap transaction to be legally null and void in its re-
port, it is raised as a possibility that clarification of legal doubts and
concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous owner-
ships of the properties involved in the swap transaction. Naturally,
apart from and beyond these facts, I would still like to know the in-
vestor’s position and solution proposals considering the legal and
societal concerns occurring in wide circles, as well as the report of
the State Audit Office and the prosecutorial procedures in progress
before the competent state attorney offices with regard to the invest-
ment project.

I recommend that the problems be discussed at a personal meeting
and for this purpose, I hereby request that you kindly contact my sec-
retariat at the following phone number [...].”

129. Upon receipt of this letter, Mr. Blum sought legal advice from his lawyer Dr. Varga
regarding the Land Swap Agreement. On 8 September 2009, Dr. Varga opined that the
valuation made by Perfekting met the requirement that the price of the properties had
to be set by an independent expert.” He stated that, based on the Hungarian Civil
Code, value disproportionality was not a basis for annulling a contract; it only rendered
a contract avoidable.'”° Dr. Varga confirmed that the issue was unsettled as to whether
the public interest condition, which is required to avoid a public tender, is met when it
only relates to a portion of the swapped territory. Dr. Varga considered that this issue
could only be settled by assessing the available data and documents, or bringing it be-
fore a court.'"!

130. The meeting requested by Dr. Oszk6 in his letter of 4 September 2009 took place on
10 September 2009 between Mr. Blum, his lawyer Dr. Bard and Dr. Oszk6. The Par-
ties disagree as to what topics were discussed at this meeting. The Tribunal will ad-
dress this meeting in more detail later.

131.

On 21 September 2009, Treviso, the valuation company appointed by the Chief Prose-
cutor’s Office, issued its opinion stating that Perfekting’s valuation appraisal for the
Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land was incorrect.'°? The opinion stated that the total
market value of both the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land was HUF 193,876,823, ra-
ther than HUF 787,400,000 as determined by Perfekting. '?

132. On 1 October 2009, the Ministry of Finance and the MNV received the Treviso opin-
ion!™ and thereby, in the MNV’s view, became aware of “a major new circumstance

that may render the swap null and void.”'°> The MNV forwarded this appraisal to Dr.

Varga. 106

In preparation for Dr. Oszk6’s “meeting to be held regarding the Sukoro real estate
property case,” Dr. Egedi of the Ministry of Finance reviewed the State Audit Office
report and the Treviso opinion and concluded in her memorandum to Dr. Oszk6 of
5 October 2009 that there were three options for what could be done: (i) “the parties
can mutually cancel the agreement [...] supposing that the conditions of a criminal of-
fence are met” or, if such conditions have not been met, then, by raising the issue of
the state having lost assets (the land swap agreement not being in line with the actual
value of the real estate property); (ii) “MNV can cancel the contract’; or (iii) “MNV
can contest the validity of the agreement.”'

On 5 October 2009, Dr. Oszk6 and other MNV officials met with Messrs. Langham-
mer and Blum and Dr. Bard. The Parties also disagree on the content and the outcome
of this meeting. A main point of disagreement is whether Dr. Oszk6 recommended to
the Project Sponsors that the Land Swap Agreement be terminated on a consensual ba-
sis and whether he said that failing an agreement the question of the validity of the
Land Swap Agreement would be referred to the courts.

Preparation and Conclusion of the Concession Contract

On 8 September 2009, Dr. Bard attended an initial meeting with Mr. Arvai at the Min-
istry of Finance to discuss the draft Concession Contract. With respect to the contrac-
tual deadline to certify legitimate possession and the right to build on the Sukoré Site,
Dr. Bard proposed “the date of submission of the application for the license of the state
tax authority, or 1 January 2014 at the latest,” instead of the 1 January 2011 deadline
proposed by the Ministry of Finance. 108

After the meeting, on 11 September 2009, Mr. Arvai sent Dr. Oszk6 the first draft of
the Concession Contract and informed him that:

“[t]he stringent regulations, guarantees, that you required due to the
unsettled legal status with respect of the properties — which are cov-
ered in sections 9.3, 12.5.1, 12.5.4, 14.3, 15.2.1.1, and 1 17.10 — can

1. The concession company shall be obliged to continuously be in
lawful possession of the properties and their appropriate parts suita-
ble for the establishment of the casino and the right to build the nec-
essary superstructures within the town of Sukor6 no later than as of
J January 2011 until the expiry of the concession period.

2. The concessionaire shall be obliged to verify no later than by 1
January 2011 that it is in lawful possession of the relevant properties
and the right to build the necessary superstructures. In the event of
breach of this obligation, the Minister of Finance shall have the right
to terminate the contract with immediate effect, and the concession-
aire shall be obliged to pay a penalty of HUF 900 million for the
failure.

3. Following the coming into effect of the concession contract, until
the commencement of the concession (the time stated in the license
for the casino), the concessionaire shall be obliged to report to the
Minister of Finance every half year, by 15 January and 15 July, re-

On 5 October 2009, Mr. Arvai sent a memorandum to Dr. Oszk6 reporting on a second
meeting with Dr. Bard regarding the Concession Contract, which had taken place on
1 October 2009. Mr. Arvai noted that Dr. Bard had suggested a six-month extension of
the deadline in Clause 9.3, i.e., until 1 July 2011 instead of 1 January 2011, and had al-
so stated that, in his opinion, “the attacks against the investment because of Sukoré
could be stopped, if the concession contract did not particularize settlements as the lo-
cation of the casino.”!"!

On 8 October 2009, Mr. Arvai sent a memorandum to Dr. Oszk6, with the Concession
Contract attached, referring to the fact that the work pertaining to the Concession Con-
tract had been carried out jointly by his division, the Sector Development and Finance
Division, and the Legal and Administrative Division, and requesting that the Minister

sign the counterparts, should he concur that “there are no legal or statutory obstacles
to the execution of the Concession Contract.”''? Mr. Arvai summarized the parties’
agreement, inter alia, that since the Concession Contract limited the right to exercise
the concession activities to the locations set out in the Tender, the list of local munici-
palities that had given their preliminary consent to the Tender was to be attached to the
Concession Contract, and the deadline to certify the legitimate possession and docu-

ment the right to build on the Project Site was to be set at 1 January 2011.18

On 8 October 2009, Dr. Oszk6 directed Dr. Janos Nagy, President of the NVT, to take
the relevant measures to restore the original condition existing prior to the land swap
transaction, and, in the event that no agreement was concluded with the swap partner,
Mr. Blum, by 9 November 2009 at the latest, to take the relevant measures for the
MNV to take “appropriate legal action for establishing the nullity of the swap transac-
tion.”'"

On 9 October 2009, KC Bidding and Dr. Oszké6, in his capacity as Minister of Finance,
acting on behalf of Hungary, signed the Concession Contract.!'> The location of the
Project was left open among the 133 settlements listed in the Tender and in Annex | of
the Concession Contract, including the Sukoré Site.

Content of the Concession Contract

The Concession Contract was concluded for a term of 20 years, with the option of a

further 10 year extension. '!°

From the Conclusion of the Concession Contract to its Termination
Land Swap Litigation

On 9 October 2009, two hours after signing the Concession Contract, the Ministry of
Finance issued a press release stating that Dr. Oszk6 had ordered Dr. Janos Nagy, Pres-
ident of the NVT, to ensure that the MNV start discussions with Mr. Blum regarding
the Sukor6é land swap “with the aim of restoration of the original — pre-land-swap-
condition.” The press release also stated that “[flor the case that discussion will not
come to a conclusion within 30 days,” the Minister requested Dr. Janos Nagy “to give
[an] order to [the] MNV to take the necessary legal steps to invalidate the land-swap
contract.” ''® Claimant claims that the Project Sponsors and Claimant were not notified
about the Ministry’s instructions or the decision to issue a press release at the signing

"° the Tribunal notes that the record does

ceremony and were surprised by its contents;
not show that there was any reaction from the Project Sponsors, voiced to a representa-

tive of Respondent.

On 20 October 2009, Dr. Varga met, on Mr. Blum’s behalf, with officials from the
MNY, including Dr. Attila Morvai, MNV’s Chief Legal Counsel, to discuss the new
situation created by the Treviso appraisal regarding the Pilis Land and the Albertirsa
Land that the MNV had received on 1 October 2009. Dr. Morvai stated that he was
under instructions to attempt by 9 November 2009, through negotiations, to restore the
situation existing prior to the signing of the Land Swap Agreement, i.e., to terminate
the Land Swap Agreement and refund to Mr. Blum amounts paid to MNV plus inter-
est. The MNV set a final deadline of 29 October 2009, 11:00 a.m., for Mr. Blum to re-
spond. Dr. Morvai stated that if this deadline was not observed, the issue would be re-
ferred to the courts in order to restore the original situation prevailing before the con-
clusion of the land swap transaction. 20

On 29 October 2009, Mr. Blum and Dr. Varga met with Dr. Miklés Kamaras, the new
CEO of the MNV, together with Dr. Morvai and other MNV officials, to discuss a
draft cancellation letter that had been prepared pursuant to a direction from the Minis-
ter of Finance and, at the request of Mr. Blum, sent to Dr. Varga. By way of introduc-
tion, Dr. Kamaras stated his view of the current status: “[A]s of today none of the real
estates that appear in the swap agreement singed [sic] at the end of June 2008 were

not [sic] registered on behalf of the parties of the agreement. At this moment the own-
ership situation is similar, there is a valid swap agreement, but no modifications in
ownership occurred accordingly.” '?! Mr. Blum disagreed with Mr. Kamaras’ view,
claiming that 16 properties had been registered in his name and that the delay in regis-
tration of the four remaining properties was the responsibility of the MNV. The parties
disagreed on this point, which Dr. Kamaras claimed was irrelevant to the meeting.'”?

Dr. Kamaras referred to the recent valuation from which it appeared that the Pilis Land
and Albertirsa Land owned by Mr. Blum had been overvalued. He concluded that, as a
result of this new information, he, as the manager of the MNV, had immediately to
take the necessary steps to avoid the damage. Dr. Kamaras stated that the MNV had
received from the Government “the mandate to restore the situation to its origins, yet
to offer another site for exchange we are not allowed to do so.”'3 Mr. Blum concluded
that the purpose of the discussion for him was to minimize his damages and responded
that he would send the MNV his proposal for modification of the cancellation agree-

ment within 48 hours. '~*

It appears from the record that Mr. Blum did not follow up with the MNV.

On 16 November 2009, Dr. Oszk6 ordered the MNV to initiate court proceedings “for
the purpose of establishing the nullity of the swap transaction [...] due to a conspicu-
ous disproportionality of value and restoration of the original condition.” He noted:

“[S ]pecial care must be taken to avoid the establishment of a damage
compensation liability on the part of the Hungarian state and for this
purpose, you should prudently present that the nullity has occurred
due to reasons attributable to Joav Blum.”

On 17 November 2009, Dr. Oszk6 reported to Prime Minister Bajnai on the outcome
of the internal investigation into the land swap. He stated that:

- he was of the opinion that the uncertainty surrounding the existence of a public in-
terest basis for the validity of the legal transaction was not in itself likely to be a
sufficient legal foundation for challenging the validity of the transaction before a
competent court;

- — the judicial expert opinion acquired in the criminal procedure underway at the Cen-
tral Investigation Department of the Attorney General’s Office had to be consid-
ered a new factor in the course of the investigation (the market value of the swap
properties offered for the state-owned properties was determined to be only HUF
193,876,823 as opposed to HUF 787,400,000 set out in the Land Swap Agree-
ment). Disproportionality between the service rendered and its compensation pro-
vided a basis for challenging the Land Swap Agreement and, as a consequence, for
establishing its nullity;

- he had requested that the NVT and MNV conduct negotiations with Mr. Blum with
a view to terminating the Land Swap Agreement by mutual agreement; however,
these negotiations had been unsuccessful because Mr. Blum intended to specify
conditions — e.g., the assumption of an unconditional damage compensation liabil-
ity on behalf of the State, the detailed entitlement and amount of which was not
specified in advance — which could not have been accepted; and

- he had directed the NVT to take the relevant measures via the MNV in the court
with relevant competency and jurisdiction, to “establish the nullity” of the Land
Swap Agreement, on the basis of a “conspicuous disproportionality in value,” and

thereby restore the original condition. 7°

161. On 18 November 2009, the MNV initiated a court case against Mr. Blum before the
Fejér County Court (number P 22597/2009) (the “Land Swap Litigation”), requesting
the court:

“[F]irstly according to Section (2), §200 of the Hungarian Civil Code
(CC), secondly according to Section (2), $201 of CC, thirdly accord-
ing to Section (3), §210 of CC [to] state firstly that the Exchange
Contract defined in Section I violates a law provision, secondly that
the value difference between the service and the consideration was
remarkably great at the time of making the Exchange Contract de-
fined in Section I, thirdly that the contracting parties laboured under
the same faulty assumption regarding the exchange value and — as
the legal consequence of invalidity for each alternative claim — we

ask the restoration of the original status in accordance with Section
(1), §237 of CC.”"""

162. The MNV further requested the court to order reimbursement of the difference already
paid and cancel any request for registration, cancel any ownership right of Mr. Blum
already recorded and register the State’s ownership right instead, and suspend any land
registration procedures in progress. 128

163. In June 2010, the newly elected Prime Minister Orban appointed Dr. Gyula Budai, a
Fidesz Member of Parliament, as the Commissioner of the Prime Minister responsible
for the investigation of the unlawful sale and privatization of State lands.'? In No-
vember 2010, Dr. Budai was appointed “government commissioner’ with a mandate to
examine the use of public funds by central budgetary authorities and State-owned
companies. 180

2. Postponement of the Signing of the Incentive Agreement and Revocation of Spe-
cial Project Status

a) The Incentive Agreement

164. On 15 October 2009, Ms. Szandrocha, Director for Incentives & After Care at ITD
Hungary, wrote to Mr. Blum referring to the need to request Governmental approval
prior to the signing of the incentive agreement. Ms. Szandrocha stated that the agree-
ment was ready for signing but “according to the latest government’s decision, before
we take the agreement for governmental approval we have to wait that the situation
around te [sic] changing of the plots and the concession gets clarified.” BI

165. Similarly, on 22 October 2009, Ms. Szandrocha wrote to Mr. Gaye, noting that the
Ministry of National Development and Economy had confirmed that “the signing of

the incentive agreement shall be postponed until the legal background of the changing

of plots (Albertirsa - Sukoré) becomes clarified.”'*°

Special Project Status

On 13 September 2010, Mr. Andras Schiffer, the leader of the green liberal Party
(LMP) and an opposition Member of Parliament, presented a question to the Govern-
ment (a so-called “parliamentary interpellation”) during the parliamentary session. He
asked about the future envisaged by the Government for the Lake Velence region, as
well as the priorities of the Government’s development policy, and requested the revo-
cation of Special Project Status that had been granted to facilitate the implementation

of the Project in Sukor6. 4

In response, Dr. Gyorgy Matolcsy, Minister of National Economy, stated:

“There will be no casino at Sukor6. We all know that [...] We know
the personal interest of the Prime Minister, he likes the countryside,
he likes the silken valleys and gentle hills round the Velence Moun-
tains and Lake Velence [...] This is what we all like. Therefore, there
will be no casino town or manufacturing town round the Lake Ve-
lence.”

Minister Matolcsy also announced that he had ordered the revocation of Special Pro-

ject Status for the Project.'*°

On 14 September 2010, Dr. Kardkovacs, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of

National Economy, prepared a proposal for the Government on the revocation of Spe-
cial Project Status. The draft proposal stated:

“According to the new plans of the government — based on environ-
mental and touristic considerations — the casino town shall not be
implemented at Sukor6. Instead, similarly to developed regions of
Western Europe, such developments and changes shall take place
which can provide a real possibility of recreation and resting.”'*"

The draft further provided that the public policy aim of the proposal was to put an end

to the “land speculation in the region of Lake Velencei” and to revoke Special Project

Status of the investment planned to be implemented on the outskirts of Sukoré. 188

170. On 23 September 2010, Special Project Status for the Project was revoked by Gov-
ernment Decree, signed by Prime Minister Orban.'” During the meeting of the Ad-
ministrative Secretaries of State on 16 September 2010 preceding the revocation, Dr.
Roza Nagy, State Secretary at the Ministry of National Economy, presented the pro-
posal as legislation of a “technical nature” on the basis that Special Project Status
should have been revoked by the previous Government “further to the land swap
agreement lawsuit, because no government could conceivably support the implementa-
tion of an investment project on unlawfully obtained land.” 140

171. On 15 October 2010, Mr. Langhammer wrote to Prime Minister Orban, expressing his
“disappointment” at the revocation of Special Project Status and stating: “[I]t is of cru-
cial importance to know that your Government remains committed to the development
of this project.” Mr. Langhammer clarified that “Vigotop Limited Investors (Mr. F H
Langhammer, Mr. I Fisher and Mr. R S Lauder), have no connection with the owner-
ship of the Sukor6 land.’"*'

172. On 18 October 2010, Mr. Benkley, Managing Director of KC Bidding, wrote to Minis-
ter Matolcsy expressing “great surprise” at the cancellation of Special Project Status
without any warning or explanation, asking Minister Matolcsy to “reconsider [his] de-
cision and to restore the original situation.”

173. On 21 October 2010, Mr. Gaye also wrote to Dr. Fellegi, Minister of National Devel-
opment, expressing his “great surprise” at the cancellation of Special Project Status
and calling upon Minister Fellegi to reconsider the Government’s decision and to re-
store the original situation.'*

174. On 4 November 2010, Mr. Péter Szijjart6, spokesman for Prime Minister Orban, re-
plied to Mr. Langhammer’s letter of 15 October 2010, stating that “/ respectfully sug-
gest we postpone the meeting proposed by you until the appropriate termination of the
proceedings put in place by the Hungarian authorities” in connection with the land

would give grounds for the worst assumptions.”'*

Performance of the Concession Contract
Submission of Suretyship

On 19 November 2009, Dr. Bard, acting on behalf of KC Bidding, submitted to the
Ministry of Finance the declaration of Mr. Lauder on the assumption of joint and sev-
eral suretyship in accordance with Section 12.4 of the Concession Contract (the “Sure-
tyship”) and requested acknowledgement of “the performance of the foregoing guar-
antee obligation.” '* The Suretyship provided that (i) the guarantee was valid during
the period 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2011, (ii) the maximum liability was the sum of
HUF 936 million, and (iii) the guarantee could be exercised only in the event that a
written demand was provided to KC Bidding, with a copy to Mr. Lauder, detailing the
unfulfilled financial undertaking of KC Bidding and providing a 30 day period for
such undertaking to be fulfilled. 146

On 9 December 2009, Mr. Arvai, from the Ministry of Finance, wrote to Dr. Bard stat-
ing: “I wish to inform you that the suretyship meets the requirements under paragraph
12.4 of the concession agreement signed between KC Bidding Kft. and the State of
Hungary of the gt of October 2009, no objection has been raised with respect to the
identity of the guarantor.”'“"
On 25 January 2010, Mr. Benkley wrote to Dr. Oszk6 stating that KC Bidding had
performed the obligations stipulated under the Concession Contract, including, inter
alia, the submission of the declaration on the assumption of joint and several surety-

ship, and requested that the Minister confirm the performance of the obligations. '**

b) Establishment of the Concession Company

179. On 11 December 2009, the Concession Company, SDI Europe Kft., was established as

'S° in accordance with Article

a Hungarian company (wholly owned by KC Bidding)
7.1 of the Concession Contract, with its principal place of business in Székesfehérvar
(the “Concession Company” or “SDI Europe”).'*! It was registered by KC Bidding

in Székesfehérvér on 21 December 2009. '°?

180. In his letter of 25 January 2010, Mr. Benkley informed Dr. Oszk6 that KC Bidding had
“established the concession company (SDI EUROPE Kft, Cg. 07-09-017657) with its

registered seat at the administrative territory of the Mid-Transdanubian Region.”

c) Efforts to Obtain Other Sites

181. Soon after the negotiations between Mr. Blum and the MNV regarding the Land Swap
Agreement had failed, the Project Sponsors started to look for alternative sites as a po-
tential location for the Project. On 9 November 2009, Claimant engaged Artonic De-
sign Kft., a local architecture firm, to assist with the search for alternative sites. On
25 February 2010, Claimant engaged Miller Buckfire & Co., LLC (“Miller
Buckfire’”), an investment bank and advisory firm, to assist in finding a strategic in-
vestor to join the Project.'°° Claimant has described its search for three sites in some
detail, namely at Babolna, Székesfehérvar and Tatabanya. 156

182. For reasons that will be discussed below, Claimant ultimately did not acquire any of
these alternative sites.

d) Efforts to Meet with Members of the Fidesz Government

183. Following the national elections in April 2010 and the election of Dr. Orban as Prime
Minister on 29 May 2010, the Project Sponsors repeatedly requested meetings with
members of the Fidesz Government, including Prime Minister Orban. For reasons that
will be discussed below, none of these requests were successful.

184. The Project Sponsors also repeatedly requested that the new Fidesz Government con-
firm that it would still support the Project.

185. On 16 September 2010, Mr. Gaye wrote a letter to Mr. Tamas Kocsis, Deputy-Chief of
Cabinet in the Ministry of National Development, noting that “in order to move for-
ward the support of your Ministry is needed” and seeking clarification as to the Minis-
try’s attitude toward the Project.'*” According to Claimant, this letter was handed to
Mr. Kocsis at a meeting between Messrs. Blum, Gaye and Kocsis on 18 September
2010,'8 Respondent notes that this letter is unsigned and could not be located in the
archives of the Ministry of National Development.'?

186. On 24 November 2010, Mr. Langhammer wrote a letter to Prime Minister Orban, in
which he complained about “a consistent course of conduct by Hungary since late
2009 that appears designed to undermine our legal rights and destroy the King’s City
project.” Mr. Langhammer gave the following examples: (i) the Government refused
to sign the agreement providing incentives for the Project Sponsors’ investment; (ii)
the Government commenced a series of civil and criminal proceedings against Mr.
Blum in connection with the Land Swap Agreement; (iii) the Government appointed a
commissioner, Dr. Budai, who had “continuously and virulently attacked the King’s
City project and Vigotop Limited’s investors and has rendered impossible KC Bidding
Kft’s attempts to secure legitimate possession of alternative sites for the project’; (iv)
the Government cancelled the Project’s Special Project Status; and (v) the Minister of
National Economy demanded that KC Bidding pay penalties following purported vio-
lations of the Concession Contract. Mr. Langhammer concluded that, without a “for-

called Sukor6 court case will be finished with a legally binding decision.” Mr. Benkley

further referred to Mr. Langhammer’s letter to Prime Minister Orban of 24 November

J. The Government of the Hungarian Republic is going to proceed
pursuant to the referring and effective legal stipulations and the pro-
visions of the [Concession] agreement.

2. Pursuant to Point 9.3 of the Concession Agreement, the Conces-
sionaire shall perform its obligations referring to the real estate from
the I" of January, 2011. In my opinion, the amendment of the
Agreement is not supportable because since the signature, on 9" Oc-
tober, 2009, the Concessionaire — if its intentions referring to the re-
alization of the investment are serious — has had the possibility to
purchase the necessary real estates in the area of the 133 settle-
ments, [...] and the Concessionaire still has the opportunity to fulfil
this obligation till the I" of January, 2011.

3. On the Session, hold [sic] on 23" September, 2010 the Govern-
ment decided to repeal the Government Decree No 83/2009. (IV.10.)
(hereinafter as Government Decree) on giving priority status to the

administrative proceedings in connection with the investment of

‘King’s city’ complex tourist project being realized in the periphery
of the Municipality of Sukoré. [...]

4. The subsidy in the amount of 2.3 billion HUF was provided for
the investor according to the decision of the Economic Cabinet,
made on 26"" August, 2008. The subsidy agreement prepared by the
ITD Hungary Zrt. has not been executed, because first the King’s
City Management Kft. asked more times for the postponement of the
signature and last the ITD Hungary Zrt. asked therefor [sic] as well.
The subsidy offer expired after the last postponement after 3 months
following the 31" of August, 2009, so neither the ITD Hungary Zrt.

Efforts to Certify Sukor6 as the Site of the Project

The Project Sponsors subsequently decided to present Sukor6 as the certified site for
the Project. To this end, on 20 December 2010, KC Bidding and SDI Europe entered
into an agreement regarding the assignment of specific rights, possession of and the
right to build on the Leased Real Properties, based on the Lease Agreement (the “As-
signment Agreement”),'® and, on 21 December 2010, KC Bidding (as transferor) and
SDI Europe (as transferee) signed and effected the Handover Protocol relating to the
Leased Real Properties. et

On 21 December 2010, Mr. Paul Benkley, Managing Director of KC Bidding, in-
formed Minister Matolcsy that SDI Europe had acquired legitimate possession of, and
the right to build on, the Leased Real Properties, and that KC Bidding had accordingly

complied with its obligations under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. '°

Termination of the Concession Contract

Upon receipt of Mr. Benkley’s letter of 21 December 2010, a meeting was held on 6
January 2011 among Dr. Budai, representatives of the Ministry of National Economy,
the Ministry of National Development and the Government Control Office and the at-
torney engaged by Hungary in the pending Land Swap Litigation regarding the letter
and the potential grounds for the termination of the Concession Contract. 166 Dr. Kard-
kovacs, the Deputy Secretary of State, and Dr. K6résmezei, the chief head of depart-
ment, sent a memo regarding the meeting to Minister Matolcsy proposing, inter alia, to
“terminate the concession contract with immediate effect and to enforce the state’s
claim for a penalty for frustration deriving therefrom” and attaching a draft termina-
tion letter.”

By letter of 10 January 2011, Minister Matolcsy notified Mr. Benkley of the termina-
tion of the Concession Contract with immediate effect and requested payment in the

amount of HUF 900 million as a cancellation penalty pursuant to Clause 12.5.1 (the
“Termination Letter”). The Termination Letter was delivered to KC Bidding on 12

1,198

January 201 Minister Matolcsy specified three grounds for the termination of the

Concession Contract:

(i) The concession receiver had failed to comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession
Contract, namely that it must “hold the legitimate right to possession of the real
properties for establishment of the Casino.” As the Concession Company had
been established and registered in Székesfehérvar, which was also its principal
place of business, the settlement community indicated by the concession receiver
for practicing the concession activity was Székesfehérvar. However, the conces-
sion receiver had only filed documents for the purpose of certifying the posses-
sion of real properties in Sukor6. This failure served as a basis for the concession
grantor’s right to termination with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1.

(ii) Even if the concession receiver had specified Sukor6 instead of Székesfehérvar
as the location for practicing the concession activity, the documents provided did
not properly comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. According to
the deed of ownership, the owner of the real properties in Sukor6 was the State
of Hungary and not Mr. Blum, who had entered into the Lease Agreement with
KC Bidding. The Assignment Agreement between KC Bidding and SDI Europe
was therefore null and void and hence could not support legitimate ownership
and building rights of SDI Europe with regard to the Sukoré Site.

(iii) As an independent ground for termination pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.22, Mr.
Lauder’s statement of guarantee, which included “limitations of temporal [...]
and pecuniary [...] nature,” failed to satisfy Clause 12.1 of the Concession Con-
tract, which requires security for the payment obligations arising from the Con-

tract.!°

Litigation following the Termination of the Concession Contract
Land Swap Litigation

In the Land Swap Litigation that had been pending since 18 November 2009, the Fejér
County Court at first instance held on 16 December 2011 that the Land Swap Agree-
ment was null and void on the basis that the contractual intent on the part of the Hun-

garian State was false and that Mr. Blum “should have known” this. For this reason,
the public interest requirement set out in Section 13(4) of the National Land Fund Act
for the avoidance of a public tender was absent. The Court further held that the Sukoré
Site should have been acquired by way of a public tender and that the Land Swap
Agreement was therefore concluded in breach of Section 13(1) of the National Land
Fund Act.!”° In addition, the Court found that the Land Swap Agreement was void un-
der Section 201(2) of the Civil Code “due to the grossly unfair difference between the
value of the services and the value of the consideration.”

On 20 January 2012, Mr. Blum filed an appeal against the decision of the Fejér County
Court with the Metropolitan Court of Appeal.

On 13 June 2012, the Metropolitan Court of Appeal upheld the Féjer County Court’s
decision and dismissed Mr. Blum’s appeal. It held that the Land Swap Agreement was
null and void on the basis that the parties had sought to circumvent Section 13(1) of
the National Land Fund Act, as the parties’ real intention was not to secure a site for
the road project, but rather to ensure that the Sukor6 Site could be acquired by Mr.
Blum without a public tender. The public interest requirement was therefore absent. As
regards the contractual intent of the parties, the Metropolitan Court of Appeal stated:
“The contractual intention of the parties was not sham, therefore the contract itself is

wv l72
not a sham contract.”""

On 16 July 2012, Mr. Blum filed a request for an extraordinary revision procedure
173,

with the Curia, the Supreme Court of Hungary.
On 13 November 2012, the Curia affirmed the previous decisions of the Fejér County
Court and the Metropolitan Court of Appeal, ordering the restoration of the original
conditions existing prior to the swap and declaring the Land Swap Agreement null and
void.'”* It decided on the basis that the swap was not justified because the criteria un-
der Section 13(4) of the National Land Fund Act are not met where the properties in
question are only partially affected by the infrastructure development and that the ef-
fect of the M4 motorway on Mr. Blum’s properties, i.e., the Albertirsa Land and the
Pilis Land, was “minimal.”'” As the Curia confirmed that the Land Swap Agreement

2. Concession Contract Litigation

199. On 23 February 2011, Respondent, represented by the Ministry of National Economy,
commenced court proceedings against KC Bidding, as party to the Concession Con-
tract, and Mr. Lauder, as guarantor of the obligations of KC Bidding pursuant to the
Suretyship, 7” before the Metropolitan Court of Budapest, seeking payment of the ac-
crued contractual penalties payable under Clauses 12.5.1 (termination for breach of

Clause 9.3)'* and 12.5.5 (breach of reporting obligations under Clause 14.3)'” of the

Concession Contract (the “Penalty Proceedings”). 180

200. On 30 March 2011, KC Bidding commenced parallel proceedings against Respondent

in the Central Court of Pest District, requesting a declaration that the termination of the

Concession Contract was unlawful (the “Termination Proceedings”). '*!

201. On 10 August 2011, KC Bidding filed a request for the suspension of the Penalty Pro-
ceedings. On 15 August 2011, Mr. Lauder also filed a request for the suspension of the
Penalty Proceedings. On 22 August 2012, this request was granted by the court.'*? On
5 September 2012, Respondent appealed the suspension order of 22 August 2012. 183

ings as an intervenor on behalf of KC Bidding; his request was granted on the same

day,'#4

V. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

A. Claimant’s Contentions and Relief Sought
1. Summary of Claimant’s Contentions

204. Claimant submits that Respondent has taken a series of unlawful measures in breach of
Article 4 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, culminating in the cancellation of the Conces-
sion Contract on 10 January 2011. These measures include (but are not limited to) “the
Respondent’s acts and omissions preventing the Claimant from securing the land re-
quired for the Project, the Respondent’s frustration of the Claimant’s attempts to find
alternative land, the Respondent’s withdrawal of a package of incentives it had offered
to the Project, and the revocation of the Special Project Status.”'*° Claimant claims
that it has incurred losses as a result of such breach and seeks compensation from Re-
spondent.

205. Claimant contends that the termination of the Concession Contract amounted to an
expropriation within the meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty in that the termination
“rendered the Claimant’s realization of the value of its investment in the King’s City

Project impossible” 187

and was, together with the Respondent’s “many [other] unlaw-
ful acts,” not justified because there was no “reasonable relationship of proportionali-
ty between the charge or weight imposed” on Claimant “and the aim sought to be real-

ized” by Respondent. 188

206. More specifically, Claimant submits that by virtue of these measures, Respondent act-
ed “arbitrarily, inconsistently, without transparency, lacking good faith and in viola-
tion of the Claimant’s legitimate investment-backed expectations.” *° In this context,
Claimant relies on investment treaty jurisprudence in its submission that violations of
other standards of investment protection, such as the fair and equitable treatment (FET)
standard (Article 3(1) of the Treaty), protection against unreasonable and discriminato-

ry measures (also Article 3(1)) and the full security and protection standard (Article

3(2)) may inform the Tribunal’s analysis of unlawful expropriation. '”°

207. Further, Claimant relies on the principles of good faith and pacta sunt servanda,
which, Claimant contends, constitute fundamental principles of international law that
“inform all of these treaty standards.” Claimant is of the view that Respondent’s con-
duct manifestly violated those principles and submits that the absence of good faith

may indicate that there has been a breach of one or more of the standards of investment

treaty protection, including expropriation. 91

208. Claimant contends that Respondent has breached the above principles in particular by;

(i) the “severe lack of transparency [which] tainted the Respondent’s conduct in

general, both in the lead up to and after the signature of the Concession Con-
tract,”'? including the issue of a press release immediately following signature
of the Concession Contract, announcing Respondent’s aim to restore the original

ownerships of the properties exchanged pursuant to the Land Swap Agree-

ment;!°

(ii) the initiation of court proceedings in order to nullify the Land Swap Agree-

ment! and the initiation of criminal investigations against former officials who

had been associated with the Project; 195

(iii) the refusal of ITD Hungary to sign an incentive agreement; 196
(iv) the revocation of Special Project Status;!””

(v) the “stonewalling of the Project Sponsors” by refusing to meet with them
throughout 2010; 198

(vi) the refusal to extend the contractual deadline for securing a site for the Pro-

jects!

(vii) the attempt by Respondent to justify its conduct with allegations of corruption
and scandal;?”

(viii) the failure of Respondent’s authorities to properly complete the tract formation
procedure concerning the Sukoré Site;?"' and

(ix) the termination of the Concession Contract on the basis of “improper and invalid
reasons”? which were in part “the result of the Respondent’s own culpable ac-
tions and omissions,” namely the acts and omissions that “thwarted Mr. Blum’s
efforts to register his ownership of the land” and the frustration of “the Project
Sponsors’ attempts to secure an alternative site for the Project”?

Claimant further submits that Respondent carried out an “aggressive media campaign"

against Claimant, the Project Sponsors and the King’s City Project following the na-

tional elections in April 2010.7"

Claimant relies on the concept of a “creeping expropriation” and submits that the Tri-
bunal must examine each of Respondent’s acts against the broader chronology of
events. Claimant submits that Respondent’s actions destroyed Claimant’s legitimate
investment-backed expectations and that their cumulative effect constituted an expro-
priation.”°°

It is Claimant’s submission that, when viewed in their totality, Respondent’s actions
support the conclusion that Respondent acted in its sovereign capacity, rather than as
an ordinary commercial counterparty.”°

Claimant further submits that in determining whether there has been an expropriation
within the meaning of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, the Tribunal “must exercise its own
judgment,” irrespective of the legality of the Respondent’s acts and omissions under
Hungarian domestic law,” particularly with regard to the outcome of the Land Swap
Litigation and the Termination Proceedings before the Hungarian courts. Claimant

contends that it is a fundamental principle of international law that a State cannot ex-
cuse its breach of international law by reference to its own domestic laws.2°8

213. Claimant submits that Respondent’s measures, in depriving Claimant of its investment,
violate Article 4 of the Treaty because Respondent has failed to satisfy any of the four
conditions for a lawful expropriation under Article 4(1) (a)-(d) of the Treaty. Claimant
contends that Respondent’s measures were “contrary to the public interest,” “did not

provide due process of law,” “were discriminatory” and “made no provision for the

payment of just compensation in respect of the expropriation of Vigotop’s invest-
ment.”°?

214. Claimant seeks compensation for losses in the amount of not less than EUR 312.6 mil-
lion (using the trading multiples approach), EUR 293.5 million (using the income ap-
proach) or EUR 278.3 million (using the comparable transactions approach), depend-
ing on the valuation methodology that the Tribunal chooses to apply.7!° Claimant sub-
mits that under customary international law, reparation must, so far as possible, wipe
out all consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if the wrongful act had not been committed. This is the prin-
ciple set out in the Chorzéw Factory case”!

rated in Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles.7!

which Claimant claims is also incorpo-

215. Claimant also refers to the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, which provides a standard for com-
pensation in the event of expropriation. Article 4(2) provides that “the amount of com-

pensation must correspond to the market value of the expropriated investment at the

- ge yy 29213
moment of expropriation.”**

216. Nevertheless, Claimant submits that the preponderance of international awards and
judgments have recognized that a different standard of compensation applies to lawful
and unlawful expropriations. It argues that, following the decision of the tribunal in

ADC v. Hungary which concerns unlawful expropriation under the Treaty, the standard

under customary international law should apply.7!

217. Accordingly, Claimant claims that it is entitled to the fair market value of its invest-
ment, valued at the latest on 10 January 2011, the date of Respondent’s formal termi-
nation of the Concession Contract.7!°

218. On the recommendation of its expert, Dr. Abdala of Compass Lexecon, Claimant bases
the valuation of the fair market value of its investment on the discounted cash flow, or
DCF, method as the “most appropriate way to calculate” it." This valuation is calcu-
lated on the basis of the Project Business Plan, dated August 2009 and prepared by
TWC,2"” which, according to Claimant, is “the most accurate indication of both
Claimant’s and Respondent’s expectations as to the commercial value of the Pro-

2

ject. 'S Dr. Abdala generated a model of the future income streams that would have

arisen from the Project and discounted these to net present value as of the valuation

date using a discount rate plus a pre-operational risk premium.”

219. Dr. Abdala thus concluded that the fair market value of the Project to Vigotop as of
10 January 2011 would have been EUR 293.5 million, based on its 75% shareholding
in KC Bidding and its 100% shareholding in KC Management.” In the alternative,
Dr. Abdala submitted a valuation of Vigotop’s investment as EUR 312.6 million
(based on a comparison of peer companies, expressed as a multiple of EV/EBITDA~”’)
or EUR 278.3 million (based on comparable transactions).

Respondent’s Contentions and Relief Sought
Summary of Respondent’s Contentions

Respondent submits that Hungary did not expropriate Claimant’s investment but rather
fully complied with its obligations under both domestic law and the Treaty.”

Respondent contends that recourse to Treaty standards other than Article 4 of the Cy-
prus-Hungary BIT is not permitted in assessing expropriation claims under this provi-
sion, as Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty provide for different and separate Treaty stand-
ards and Article 7 unambiguously restricts the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to expropriation
claims.*4

With regard to the alleged expropriation of Claimant’s investment, Respondent sub-
mits that the Concession Contract gave Respondent a contractual right of termination,
which Respondent, acting as an ordinary contracting party, invoked on 10 January
2011.75 Respondent claims that, as Claimant was free to dispute the legality of the
termination and has in fact done so by bringing proceedings for wrongful termination
before the Hungarian courts, there can be no finding of an expropriation, on the

grounds that Claimant’s contractual remedies remain available.”°

224. Respondent contends that, in any event, it terminated the Concession Contract in ac-
cordance with both its terms and Hungarian law and that the termination of the Con-
cession Contract therefore cannot constitute an expropriation.”””

225. In particular, Respondent argues that Mr. Blum could not have acquired valid legal
title to the Sukoré Site constituting “Jegitimate possession”; no rights or obligations
could be derived from the Land Swap Agreement because it was, as now confirmed by
the Curia, null and void ab initio.? Respondent further submits that the suspicious
conditions in which the Land Swap Agreement was concluded explain why Hungary
considered the Land Swap Agreement to be invalid even prior to the confirmation by a
court decision.”

226. Respondent contends that it did not cause the grounds for termination in any way. Re-
spondent submits that KC Bidding failed to secure a Project site in Sukoré for reasons
unrelated to Respondent and claims that the Project Sponsors were aware from the out-
set of the likely unavailability of the Sukoré Site but nevertheless chose it as the Pro-
ject site for reasons unknown to Respondent.”

227. Respondent claims that Dr. Oszk6 acted transparently during the preparation and con-
clusion of the Concession Contract, particularly with regard to the Land Swap Agree-
ment,”*! and that the Project Sponsors were kept informed of all relevant develop-

23.
ments.”*?

228. With regard to Claimant’s argument that the termination was a disproportionate re-
sponse to what were relatively minor contractual breaches, Respondent argues that
Claimant’s breach related to one of KC Bidding’s core obligations under the Conces-
sion Contract, namely to find an appropriate site for the Project.

229. In response to the alleged violations of the good faith principle by its pre-termination
conduct, Respondent submits that its conduct was at all times in good faith, and that
none of Respondent’s acts deprived Claimant of its investment.”

230. In relation to the failed tract formation procedure, Respondent claims that while
Claimant may have experienced some inefficiency as regards the administrative pro-
cess of the Hungarian bureaucracy, these problems did not rise to the level of a viola-
tion of any provision of the Treaty, let alone expropriation.*° In any event, the need
for the tract formation procedure derived from the Land Swap Agreement, which was
found null and void ab initio by the Hungarian courts; any issue that arose out of the
tract formation procedure was thus rendered moot.?°°

231.

Respondent further submits that Claimant’s claimed expectations relating to the finan-
cial incentive package offered to the Project Sponsors and the Special Project Status
are baseless. ITD Hungary’s incentive proposal was premised on the implementation
of the Project at Sukoré and remained subject to the final approval of the Govern-
ment.?*” Similarly, Special Project Status would only have been applicable if the Pro-
ject had proceeded at Sukor6.78
232. With regard to Claimant’s submissions on the alleged media campaign, Respondent
contends that those events cannot be attributed to Respondent.?” Respondent asserts
that the investigations relating to the Land Swap Agreement did not target the Project
and had no bearing on Respondent’s decision to terminate the Concession Contract.”
As regards the legislative changes allegedly aimed at destroying the Project, Respond-
ent similarly asserts that they did not target Claimant or the Project and did not con-
tribute in any way to the alleged expropriation of Claimant’s investment.”"!
233. In response to Claimant’s contention that the Project could not have been realized
without active State support, Respondent submits that there is no obligation under in-
ternational law to actively support foreign investments and contends that omissions,
however egregious, are not sufficient to constitute an expropriation.”

234. With regard to Claimant’s submissions on quantum, Respondent answers that Claim-
ant is not entitled to any compensation.” According to Respondent, Claimant has not
met its burden of showing that the allegedly lost future profits were “probable.”*** As

of 10 January 2011, the King’s City Project was nothing more than a desktop concep-
245

tual study, unsupported by any market data or feasibility study.

235. Respondent submits that the Project only had a remote chance of materializing because
(i) there is no proven, existing market for a mega-casino resort in Europe; (ii) the Pro-
ject Sponsors had no expertise in developing and operating a casino and failed to find a
strategic partner interested in investing in and operating the Project; and (iii) the Pro-
ject might not have been “bankable,” especially in light of the financial crisis.“

236. Nor, according to Respondent, has Claimant met its burden of proving the quantum of
its alleged loss.247 Respondent submits that the DCF method is consistently rejected as
a methodology, to value undeveloped projects, such as King’s City, that are not going
concerns and lack a record of profitability.“*

237. In addition, Dr. Abdala’s DCF method contains flaws which, when corrected, yield a
much lower fair market value, if not a negative value.” These include overly optimis-

0

tic revenue projections,” understated projections of development and operating

costs,”*! and a discount rate that ignores the Project’s high risk of failure.”

238. With respect to the alternative valuations, Respondent submits that the market-based
valuations offer no validation for Dr. Abdala’s valuation opinion.?* Respondent

 

claims that the comparator companies and transactions are insufficiently similar to the
investment to be valued?” and the trading multiples valuation is circular.?>>

239. Respondent argues that Dr. Abdala’s valuation opinion is contradicted by contempora-
neous arm’s length-transactions, such as the 2009 Dream Island Transaction in Buda-
pest and the proposed Euro Vegas project in 2007, the Miller Buckfire engagement let-

ter with Vigotop, the Concession Contract itself and the 2008 Option Agreement be-

tween Vigotop and ACC, the minority shareholder in KC Bidding.”*°

Respondent’s Request for Relief

In its Rejoinder, Respondent requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an award:***

(i) dismissing Claimant’s claims in their entirety;

(ii) declaring that Respondent did not expropriate Claimant’s investment in Hunga-
Ty;

(iii) ordering Claimant to bear all costs incurred by Respondent in connection with
this arbitration, including without limitation the fees and expenses of the mem-

bers of the Tribunal, attorneys’ fees, fees of expert witnesses, and the charges for
use of the facilities of the Centre; and

(iv) ordering any further relief that it may deem appropriate.

THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONING

By way of introduction, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully re-
viewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties during the course of
these proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evi-
dence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered
and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.

Jurisdiction
General Jurisdictional Requirements

The Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction derives from Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention in connection with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides, in its relevant part:

“(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or
any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State desig-
nated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Con-

tracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to
submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no
party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

(2)

‘National of another Contracting State’ means:

(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Con-
tracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the
date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to
conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the
request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28
or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person
who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting
State party to the dispute; and

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Con-
tracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the
date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to
conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had
the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on
that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties
have agreed should be treated as a national of another Con-
tracting State for the purposes of this Convention.”

Page -58-

245. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention sets out four requirements for the Tribunal to have

a)

246.

b)

247.

jurisdiction: (i) the existence of a legal dispute; (ii) a dispute arising directly out of an

“investment”, (iii) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Con-

tracting State; and (iv) the existence of the written consent of both Parties. It is com-

mon ground between the Parties that all four conditions are met in the present case.

Existence of a Legal Dispute

The Parties agree that there is a legal dispute relating to Respondent’s alleged viola-

tions of the Treaty and Claimant’s claimed corresponding right to compensation for the

losses it incurred as a result of such violations.

Dispute Arising Directly Out of an Investment

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not define the term “investment”; however, a

definition can be found in Article 1(1) of the Treaty which reads in its relevant part:

“I. The term ‘investments’ shall comprise every kind of asset con-
nected with the participation in companies and joint ventures, more
particularly, though not exclusively:

[.

J

Award Page -59-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

(b) rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in
companies;

bok

248. The Parties do not dispute that Claimant’s investment in the territory of Respondent
consisted of its shareholdings in its two Hungarian subsidiaries, KC Bidding (in which
it held 75% of the shares) and KC Management (in which it held 100% of the shares),
as well as KC Bidding’s rights under the Concession Contract.?°°

249. The Tribunal notes that Claimant submits that its investment further consisted of a se-
ties of contracts and other rights related to the Project, and in particular contends that
“KC Bidding also held contractual rights to the Sukor6 site by virtue of the Land Swap
Agreement and associated Lease Agreements, which [...] remained valid at the valua-

19260

tion date, whereas Respondent is of the view that Claimant’s investment is limited

to the assets set out in the previous paragraph.?°!

With regard to its jurisdiction, the
Tribunal considers it sufficient that the Parties agree that Claimant has indeed made an
investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty, which comprises (at least)
its shareholdings in KC Bidding and KC Management and KC Bidding’s rights under

the Concession Contract.

250. Further, it is not disputed that Claimant is an investor within the meaning of Article
1(3)(b) of the Treaty which provides that the term “investor” includes “legal persons
constituted or incorporated in compliance with the law of that Contracting Party.” It is
undisputed that Claimant was incorporated on 25 October 2008 and is a legal person
constituted in accordance with the laws of Cyprus.7

251.

The Parties agree that the Treaty does not protect “investors” independently of their
“investment,” nor does it protect a “right to invest.”?®* Claimant confirms that it does
not seek relief for the violation of any “right to invest,” but that its claim relates only to
Respondent’s alleged deprivation of investments that had already been made before
Respondent’s alleged misconduct took place.”

It is therefore undisputed that, with regard to Claimant’s shareholdings in KC Bidding
and KC Management, as well as KC Bidding’s rights under the Concession Contract,
the legal dispute between the Parties arises directly out of an investment within the
meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Dispute Between a Contracting State and a National of Another Contracting State

It is also common ground between the Parties that the dispute is between a Contracting
State to the ICSID Convention and a national of another Contracting State. Hungary is
a Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(1) because Hungary ratified the
ICSID Convention on 4 February 1987 and the Convention entered into force for Hun-
gary on 6 March 1987. Vigotop is a national of another Contracting State within the
meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and in accordance with the nation-
ality requirement set out in Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, because it is a
company constituted under the laws of Cyprus. Cyprus ratified the ICSID Convention
on 25 November 1966, and it came into force for Cyprus on 25 December 1966.2

Existence of the Written Consent of Both Parties

Both Parties have consented in writing to submit their dispute to the ICSID for arbitra-
tion. Respondent gave its consent in writing by way of Article 7 of the Cyprus-
Hungary BIT, such consent becoming effective upon the entry into force of the Treaty
on 25 May 1990, prior to the actions/omissions of Respondent giving rise to this dis-
pute.?°° Article 7 provides that an investor may request arbitration of the dispute if it
cannot be settled “within six months from the date either party requested amicable set-
tlement.” Claimant complied with Article 7 by notifying Respondent of the dispute in
writing on 17 January 2011 and inviting Respondent to settle the dispute amicably.
Claimant then submitted the dispute to arbitration after the expiry of the cooling-off
period, namely on 18 July 2011.757 In submitting its Request for Arbitration on 18 July
2011, Claimant consented in writing to submit the dispute to the ICSID for arbitra-
tion.7°8

As all four requirements are met in this case, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the pre-
sent case has been established on the basis of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and
Articles 1 and 7 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT.

Scope of Jurisdiction

The Parties agree that the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is determined by Article
7 of the Treaty, which provides:

“1, Any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of
the other Contracting Party concerning expropriation of an invest-
ment shall, as far as possible, be settled by the disputing parties in an
amicable way.

If such dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date ei-
ther party requested amicable settlement, it shall, upon request of the
investor, be submitted to one of the following:

(a) The Arbitration Institute of the Arbitral Tribunal of the Chamber
of Commerce in Stockholm;

(b) the Arbitral Tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce
in Paris;

(c

the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Dis-
putes in case both Contracting Parties have become members of
the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Invest-
ment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.”

There is no dispute between the Parties that Article 7 of the Treaty limits the Tribu-
nal’s jurisdiction to the consideration of claims relating to expropriation.”” Claimant
also confirms that, although it is of the view that non-expropriation standards of pro-
tection under the Treaty or under customary international law may be relevant to the
finding of an expropriation, it does not raise any separate cause of action in relation to
such non-expropriation standards.?”

The Tribunal notes Respondent’s view that, in adjudicating claims of unlawful expro-
priation under Article 4 of the Treaty, the Tribunal need not — and must not — have re-

course to other standards of investment protection.7”!

However, as Claimant expressly
raises only expropriation claims, the Tribunal considers that the potential relevance of
the alleged violation of non-expropriation standards to its decision on the expropriation

claim is an issue for the merits, rather than jurisdiction.

B. Standard of Protection Against Expropriation under the Treaty

Page -62-

259. Article 4 of the Treaty sets out the standard of protection against expropriation. It pro-

vides:

“1, Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, di-
rectly or indirectly, investors of the other Party of their investments
unless the following conditions are complied with:

(a) The measures are taken in the public interest and under due
process of law;

(b) the measures are not discriminatory;

(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of
just compensation.

2. The amount of compensation must correspond to the market value
of the expropriated investments at the moment of the expropriation.

3. The amount of this compensation may be estimated according to
the laws and regulations of the country where the expropriation is
made.

4. The compensation must be paid without undue delay upon comple-
tion of the legal expropriation procedure, but not later than three
months upon completion of this procedure and shall be transferred in
the currency in which the investment is made. In the event of delay
beyond the three-months’ period, the Contracting Party concerned
shall be liable to the payment of interest based on prevailing rates.

5. Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer losses of their in-
vestments in the territory of the other Contracting State due to war
or other armed conflict or state of emergency in the territory of the
other Contracting Party, shall be treated, with respect to the com-
pensation for these losses, as investors of any third State.”

1. Summary of Claimant’s Position

260. Claimant submits that the use of the term “deprivation” in Article 4(1) of the Treaty is

equivalent to the term “expropriation” in customary international law. According to

Claimant, measures of deprivation constitute a “taking” of private property by the State

Award Page -63-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

without the owner’s consent and there is no requirement that the “taking” benefit the
State concerned, or that it benefit any third party.?”

261.

Claimant argues that measures of deprivation can be direct or indirect. In relation to
indirect expropriation, Claimant refers to the cases of CME Czech Republic N.V. v.
Czech Republic in which the tribunal held that measures will constitute indirect expro-
priation when they “do not involve an overt taking but [...] effectively neutralize the

benefit of the property of the foreign owner,”*”

as well as Metalclad Corporation v.
The United Mexican States in which the tribunal held that an indirect expropriation
will occur when the measures have “the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in
significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of proper-
ty

262. Claimant submits that an indirect expropriation may manifest itself as a “creeping ex-
propriation,” whereby the investor’s rights are devalued by virtue of a number of acts
or omissions of a host State that cumulatively destroy the investment.””> Claimant re-
fers to the case of Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania in which the tribunal affirmed that it
should consider “the effect of individual, isolated, acts complained of, as well [...] the
cumulative effect of a series of individual acts, in so far as such a cumulative effect
might be to deprive the investor in whole or in material part of the use or economic
benefit of its assets.”°7°

263. Claimant also refers to Prof. Schrijver’s opinion that “[p]Jarticularly when the expro-
priation is alleged to have resulted from a broad series of acts, none of which [is] nec-
essarily illegal under domestic law per se, the correct approach can only be to exam-
ine how each of those acts is ‘properly’ and ‘fairly’ to be characterized when viewed
against the broader chronology of events, in the general pattern, of which it forms
part.” In reliance on Prof. Schrijver, Claimant asserts that Article 4(1) of the Treaty

is “broad in scope.”?”8

264. Claimant submits that the Tribunal must examine each of Respondent’s acts in light of
the circumstances surrounding, inter alia, the decision to invest and the process culmi-
nating in the termination of the Concession Contract. According to Claimant, “the crit-
ical question for the Tribunal is whether the totality of the Respondent’s actions in
their cumulative effect constitutes an expropriation.”?””

265. Claimant is further of the view that the effect of Respondent’s measures on the inves-
tor’s legitimate expectations must also be taken into account.”*°

266. Claimant states that the scope of Article 4(1) of the Treaty extends to the protection of
intangible rights, which include shares and equity interests, as well as contractual
rights. In this regard, Claimant relies on the case of RosInvest v. Russia to support its
argument that Vigotop may claim protection “for the effect on its shares by measures
of the host state” taken against the Project Companies.”*!

267. Finally, Claimant is of the view that the termination of a concession contract for inva-
lid reasons constitutes a form of expropriation of a claimant’s rights under such a con-
tract, even when, as is the case here, it is the investor’s subsidiary who is the party to
the contract.”**

2. Summary of Respondent’s Position

268. Respondent submits that there is no dispute as to the general description of the re-
quirements of a lawful expropriation under Article 4(1) of the Treaty. Respondent fur-
ther does not contest Claimant’s submission that an expropriation may be direct or in-
direct (including creeping) in nature.**

269. Respondent refers to the case of Tecmed v. Mexico in which the tribunal held that a
direct expropriation involves “a forcible taking by the Government of tangible or in-
tangible property owned by the private person by means of administrative or legisla-
tive action to that effect.” Respondent submits that, by contrast, an indirect expro-
priation results from “the incremental encroachment on one or more of [the investor’ s]

ownership rights [...] that eventually destroys (or nearly destroys) the value of his or
99285

her investment.
270. In relation to creeping expropriation, Respondent refers to the case of Generation
Ukraine v. Ukraine in which the tribunal stated that creeping expropriation “is a form
of indirect expropriation with a distinctive temporal quality in the sense that it encap-
sulates the situation whereby a series of acts attributable to the State over a period of

time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such property.”?*°

271.

Respondent submits that a finding of expropriation requires State interference of a cer-
tain magnitude or severity. It cites the case of Pope & Talbot v. Canada, in which the
tribunal held that “under international law, expropriation requires a ‘substantial dep-
rivation’.”°87

272. According to Respondent, Claimant has conceded that Respondent’s conduct prior to
the termination of the Concession Contract did not interfere with Claimant’s invest-
ment to such an extent as to constitute “substantial deprivation” and that the termina-
tion of the Concession Contract is therefore the “crux” of Claimant’ s claim.7**

273.

o

Respondent considers that Claimant appears to advance two expropriation claims: (i)
that the termination “in and of itself [was] an expropriatory act,” and (ii) that the ter-
mination was “the last step” in a series of measures that together constituted a creeping
expropriation. Respondent refers to the case of Enron v. Argentina in which the tribu-
nal held that “ifa given measure qualifies as a form of direct expropriation it cannot at
the same time qualify as an indirect expropriation, as their nature and extent are dif-
ferent??? In Respondent’s view, Claimant’s two claims are therefore necessarily al-

ternative claims.”

cess of law;

(b) the measures are not discriminatory;

(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of
just compensation.”

The criteria for the legality of expropriation set out in Article 4(1) of the Treaty are
largely consistent with customary international law. The Tribunal notes however that,
in the present case, the Parties are primarily in dispute as to whether an expropriation
occurred as a matter of fact. As Article 4 does not define when an expropriation has
taken place as a matter of fact, this must be determined in light of the evidence.

There is no dispute between the Parties as to the legal concept of deprivation or expro-
priation, including that expropriation may take place indirectly. The Tribunal agrees
with Claimant’s legal expert Prof. Schrijver that the language used in Article 4(1) of
the Treaty is “broad in scope.””*! Indeed, Article 4(1) of the Treaty expressly provides
for a protection standard covering measures that “directly or indirectly” deprive inves-
tors of their investments. Furthermore, it is common ground between the Parties that
indirect expropriation may take place in a “creeping” manner.

The Tribunal notes that Claimant advances claims for both direct and indirect expro-
priation. In its Reply, Claimant distinguishes between its claims (i) that Respondent di-
rectly expropriated Claimant’s investment by terminating the Concession Contract, and
(ii) that in any event, the cumulative effect of Respondent’s culpable acts and omis-
sions culminating in the termination was an indirect and creeping expropriation.” In
its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant focuses on its claim for indirect expropriation, which
is based on the “totality of Respondent’s actions in their cumulative effect,” without
further elaborating on its claim for direct expropriation.””?

In the Tribunal’s view, Claimant has not established that Respondent's actions and
omissions prior to the termination of the Concession Contract, in and of themselves,
had an expropriatory effect on Claimant’s investment. This includes the revocation of
Special Project Status for the Sukoré Site because the Tribunal is not convinced that
this revocation would have prevented Claimant from realizing the Project, be it at Su-
kor6 or at any of the 132 alternative sites contemplated under the Concession Contract,
as will be discussed in more detail below. In any event, Claimant has not claimed that
the revocation of Special Project Status in itself amounts to an expropriation. Conse-
quently, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent’s pre-termination actions and
omissions do not amount to an indirect or creeping expropriation, as alleged by Claim-
ant.

By contrast, there is no doubt that the termination of the Concession Contract resulted
in a substantial devaluation of Claimant’s shareholdings in KC Bidding by depriving
KC Bidding of its main asset, i.e., its rights under the Concession Contract. It is further
undisputed between the Parties that Article 4 of the Treaty protects Claimant against
measures directed not only at Claimant’s shareholdings in their own right, but also at
Claimant’s indirect interest in KC Bidding’s rights under the Concession Contract. A
substantial devaluation of Claimant’s shareholdings could thus constitute a taking of
Claimant’s investment within the meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty.

Consequently, the Tribunal will focus on the question whether, as a matter of fact, the
termination of the Concession Contract constituted an expropriatory act within the
meaning of Article 4 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT. In order to establish that the termi-
nation of the Concession Contract was of an expropriatory nature, Claimant must show
in particular that the termination was a sovereign act rather than the act of an ordinary
contracting party. In view of the fact that Claimant describes the termination of the
Concession Contract as the “culminating” point of Respondent’s various, allegedly un-
lawful, pre-termination actions and omissions, the Tribunal’s analysis will also take in-
to account Respondent’s pre-termination conduct.

Relevance of Other Standards of Protection in the Cyprus-Hungary BIT

Before turning to its analysis, the Tribunal will first address the disputed issue whether
other standards of protection in the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, in particular the fair and eq-
uitable treatment standard (the “FET standard”) contained in Article 3, may be rele-
vant to the finding of an expropriation.

1. Summary of Claimant’s Position

282. Claimant submits that the non-expropriation standards of protection under the Treaty
are relevant to the Tribunal’s interpretation of the scope of Respondent’s obligations
under Article 4 of the Treaty and, in particular, to the assessment whether Respondent
neutralized Claimant’s investment by way of expropriatory conduct. In Claimant’s
view, Respondent’s conduct constitutes multiple violations of such standards and is of
central relevance for distinguishing an expropriation from bona fide regulation.”

283. Claimant argues that non-expropriation standards of protection under the Treaty are
relevant not only to the assessment of the legality of an expropriation, but also to the
assessment whether an expropriation has taken place.””° Claimant submits that the de-

296 and Nations Energy Inc. v. Panama,” relied upon by

cisions in Telenor v. Hungary
Respondent in support of its argument that other Treaty standards are not relevant, are
inapplicable to the facts of this case. Vigotop states that the claimants in both of those
cases raised two separate claims, one for expropriation and one for breach of the FET
standard, and the tribunals refused to examine the self-standing claims for breach of
FET as they fell outside their jurisdiction.?* In this case however, Claimant does not

raise a separate claim for relief for breach of the FET standard.”

284. Claimant relies on ADC v. Hungary, in which the claimants similarly limited their
claim for relief to the allegation that Hungary had expropriated their investments. The
tribunal ruled that there was an expropriation and expressly referred to Hungary’s
breach of other investment protection standards contained in the Treaty.°”

285. Claimant also refers to the case of RosInvest v. Russia, in which the tribunal, despite its
jurisdiction being limited to expropriation, observed that it was doubtful whether Rus-
sia’s actions could be seen as affording fair and equitable treatment.*”!

286. Claimant further relies on Prof. Schrijver’s legal opinion, in which he states:

“[I]t cannot be denied that the same conduct will often be capable of
giving rise to breaches of different standards of protection. The po-
tential for overlap exists in particular between the fair and equitable
treatment standard and the protection against indirect expropria-
tions.””~

287. Claimant asserts that Respondent does not challenge Claimant’s submission that many
of the elements relevant to the finding of a breach of the FET standard can materially
inform the inquiry into whether there was an indirect expropriation. For example, Re-
spondent does not contest the relevance of investors’ legitimate expectations to both
the expropriation and the FET standard.*

288. Claimant acknowledges that each of the Treaty standards protects against a different
kind of interference by a State. Nevertheless, Claimant is of the view that even the au-
thorities relied upon by Respondent do not undermine the argument that the same con-
duct will often be capable of giving rise to breaches of different standards of protec-

a3
tion.

289. In response to Respondent’s reliance on the case of FFIC v. Mexico, in which the tri-
bunal found that a clear case of discriminatory treatment did not give rise to an expro-
priation claim, Claimant contends that the tribunal’s reasoning in that case would sug-
gest the existence of a sliding scale, such that severely discriminatory treatment will
rise to the level of an expropriation. Claimant alleges that the tribunal’s recognition in
that case that discriminatory treatment is used “as one of the factors to distinguish be-
tween a compensable expropriation and a non-compensable regulation by a host

State”

confirms the relevance of the standard to the existence of an expropriatory act
and thereby confirms Claimant’s submission that the FET standard is relevant to the

3
present case.” 06

290. Claimant also refers to the case of Quasar de Valores v. Russia, in which the tribunal’s
jurisdiction was limited to the question whether the respondent had expropriated the
claimant’s investment without compensation and whether that expropriation was law-

ful. In that case, the tribunal noted that, while the unlawfulness of an expropriation is
not the same thing as the existence of an expropriation, there is a strong overlap be-

tween the elements relevant to both analyses.*””

291.

Claimant refers to Prof. Schrijver’s statement:

“The practice of using the fair and equitable treatment standard as a

yardstick to considering whether host State conduct transcended the
threshold of an indirect expropriation has been adopted by invest-
ment tribunals, whose jurisdiction was otherwise confined to claims
concerning expropriation.”*°*

292.

Nv

Claimant also relies on the case of Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, in which the tribunal
found that the withdrawal of a tax exemption “is best dealt with as a violation of the
fair and equitable treatment standard and as one of the events which converted the
contract termination process into an expropriation.”

293. Claimant concludes that if conduct constituting a violation of the FET standard can
“convert” a lawful act into an expropriatory one, it must be relevant for the present
Tribunal to consider Respondent’s actions in light of the FET and other Treaty stand-

ards.*!°

2. Summary of Respondent’s Position

x

Respondent submits that, in assessing Claimant’s expropriation claims under Article 4
of the Treaty, the Tribunal need not consider — or decide — Claimant’s claims concern-
ing alleged violations of Article 3 of the Treaty, on the basis that Articles 3 and 4 pro-
vide for separate and independent Treaty standards and should be treated as such.*!!

295. Respondent refers to the case of FFIC v. Mexico, in which the jurisdiction of the tribu-
nal was limited to claims concerning expropriation and compensation. In that case, the
tribunal rejected the argument that it is significant in expropriation cases whether the
government’s acts and omissions are unfair and inequitable, and held that the claim-
ant’s argument “would conflate an [expropriation] claim with a [FET] claim, which is

tion”!

296. Respondent emphasizes that it does not suggest that considerations of due process and

non-discrimination are not at all relevant in the context of Article 4 of the Treaty, but
rather that such considerations concern the legality of an expropriation and do not re-
late to the existence of an expropriatory measure.*!3 Respondent claims that only once
the existence of an expropriation has been established can the question of its legality
under the terms of the Treaty, including considerations of due process and non-

discrimination, arise.?!*

297. As regards the case of FFIC v. Mexico, Respondent also highlights the tribunal’s rea-

soning that “one cannot start an inquiry into whether expropriation has occurred by

 

whether the conditions [...] for avoiding liability in the event of an expro-
priation have been fulfilled”?

298. Respondent further refers to the case of Corn Products International, Inc. v. Mexico in

which the tribunal held:

“It is not the case that, because a measure which affects property
rights is discriminatory, it is therefore an expropriation [...] Rather,
if a measure is established to be an expropriation [...], it cannot then
be justified if it is discriminatory.”*!°

299. In response to Claimant’s reference to the case of ADC v. Hungary, Respondent asserts

312

that Claimant confuses the distinction between the existence of expropriatory measures
and their legality. Respondent submits that the claimants in that case asserted breaches
of Article 3 of the Treaty in the context of a violation of Article 4(1)(a) of the Treaty,
which stipulates that due process is a condition for the legality of an expropriation. Re-
spondent submits that the tribunal initially determined that there was an expropriation
and even examined its legality without making any reference to Article 3 of the Treaty.
It was not until its ultimate conclusion on the merits that the tribunal noted that the ex-

propriation was unlawful because “it did not comply with due process, in particular,

the Claimants were denied of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ specified in Article 3(1) of
the BIT and the Respondent failed to provide ‘full security and protection’ to the
Claimants’ investments under Article 3(2) of the BIT?" In Respondent’s view, the
tribunal in that case exceeded its jurisdiction in determining liability under Article 3 of
the Treaty even if its determination ultimately related only to the illegality of the ex-

propriation.* 1s

not justify reference to violations of protection standards contained in Article 3 in the
context of expropriation claims under Article 4. Respondent submits that considera-
tions of due process and non-discrimination in the context of an expropriation claim
are part of the assessment whether an expropriation is lawful under Article 4(1)(a)-(c)
and can be resolved without reference to Article 3.°"°

Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s reliance on the case of Biwater Gauff v. Tanza-
nia in its submission that “[v]iolations of other standards of investment protection [...]
may contribute to a finding of unlawful expropriation”? Respondent argues that the
award merely illustrates that one aspect of State conduct may give rise to several in-
vestment treaty violations; it does not support Claimant’s contention that one treaty vi-
olation may contribute to another treaty violation.*?!

2. It is Respondent’s view that “Claimant’s extensive reliance on non-expropriation
Treaty standards betrays the absence of any expropriatory conduct in this case.”
Respondent submits that Claimant “attempts to salvage its ultra vires non-
expropriation claims” by emphasizing that it does not raise a separate claim for Hun-
gary’s alleged failure to accord fair and equitable treatment. Respondent refers to the
case of Emmis International v. Hungary in which the tribunal held that an investor
cannot justify the submission of claims that exceed the State’s consent to arbitration
simply by refraining from requesting separate relief? According to Respondent,

Claimant’s reliance on non-expropriation standards should therefore be rejected even if
it is not accompanied by a separate request for relief.

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

303. The Tribunal recalls at the outset that, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Treaty, its juris-
diction is limited to disputes “concerning expropriation of an investment.” While the
Treaty provides for other standards of protection, in particular the FET standard, any
dispute concerning such other standards does not fall within the scope of the Tribu-
nal’s jurisdiction.

304. As noted above, the Tribunal will first examine whether an expropriation has taken
place as a matter of fact. If this is not the case, the Tribunal will not have to address the
second question whether the expropriation was lawful.

305. In the Tribunal’s view, the cases cited by the Parties, in which the tribunals’ jurisdic-
tion was limited to expropriation claims as is the case here, give no clear guidance as
to whether non-expropriation standards may be applied in determining whether there
was an expropriation. In particular, the case law suggests that non-expropriation stand-
ards have been considered primarily in determining the legality of an established ex-
propriation, namely in the context of assessing compliance with the requirements of
due process of law and non-discrimination, such as those articulated in Article 4(1)(a)
and (b) of the Treaty.

306. In the case of ADC v. Hungary," which was relied upon by Claimant, the relevance
of other treaty standards was discussed only in the context of due process, i.e., in rela-
tion to the assessment whether the expropriation was lawful. Consequently, the tribu-
nal’s decision in that case gives no guidance as to whether non-expropriation treaty
standards can be used to determine whether an expropriation has occurred.

307. Claimant further relies on the case of RosInvest v. Russia, in which the tribunal, despite
its jurisdiction being limited to expropriation, *”° concluded that “there remain doubts

4 ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary, \CSID Case No.

ARB/03/16, Award (2 October 2006), Exhibit CLA-5.

*°5 The arbitration clause in the UK-Soviet BIT originally limited the tribunal’s jurisdiction in that case even
further than in the present case, since it did not even extend to the question whether an expropriation had oc-
curred, but rather limited the jurisdiction to the consequences of an expropriation, such as compensation. How-
ever, the tribunal held in its previous award on jurisdiction that the claimant could invoke the most-favored-
nation clause contained in the UK-Soviet BIT to incorporate the broader arbitration clause contained in the
Denmark-Russia BIT. As a consequence, the tribunal held that “it has jurisdiction extending beyond that grant-
ed by Article 8 of the UK-Soviet BIT and covering the issues whether Respondent’s actions have to be consid-

Award Page -74-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

whether [the distinctions made between the claimant and its competitors] can be seen
as a fair and equitable treatment.”**° However, the tribunal did not give any precise
reasons as to why it was appropriate to consider fair and equitable treatment in analyz-
ing the expropriation claim, and ultimately concluded that it did not have to decide
whether its doubts were justified.*? Consequently, this case also does not give clear
guidance as to whether the FET standard as such may be relied upon in the finding of
an expropriation.

308. Finally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent relies upon the case of FFIC v. Mexico in
support of its argument that the Tribunal may not resort to other Treaty standards. In
that case, the tribunal clearly stated that the claimant could not rely on the FET stand-
ard in support of its expropriation claim because this would “conflate” an FET claim
with an expropriation claim, which in turn would not be consistent with the exclusion
of FET claims from investor-State arbitration under Chapter Fourteen of the
NAFTA.** With regard to the relevance of discriminatory treatment on the other hand,
the tribunal stated that such treatment not only was relevant to the question whether an
expropriation was lawful, but also constituted one of the factors distinguishing expro-
priation from bona fide regulation by the host-State.*” The tribunal reached the con-
clusion that the respondent’s conduct was a clear case of discriminatory treatment of a
foreign investor, but held that this conduct did not give rise to an expropriation claim
because it did not involve a taking of the investment.*”

309. The Tribunal is of the view that, while Claimant correctly points out that the tribunal in
FFIC v. Mexico considered the respondent’s discriminatory treatment to be a relevant
“factor” in its analysis whether there was an expropriation, it does not follow from the
decision that the tribunal considered it possible to refer to other standards of protec-
tion. To the contrary, the tribunal clearly held that the claimant could not rely upon a
breach of the FET standard as such to prove its expropriation claim. The Tribunal is

312.

therefore of the view that FFIC v. Mexico tends rather to support Respondent’s posi-
tion that other Treaty standards in general, and the FET standard in particular, may not
be applied in determining whether there was an expropriation.

In the absence of clear precedents relevant to the present case, the Tribunal is of the
view that it cannot decide whether an expropriation has occurred by determining
whether other Treaty standards have been violated. In particular, the violation of the
FET standard, for example, is neither a necessary nor sufficient basis for finding an
expropriation. Thus, the Tribunal will not resort to other Treaty standards in determin-
ing whether an expropriation has occurred. This being said, the Tribunal notes that it is
undisputed that the principle of good faith is a fundamental principle of international

al consideration of which is not restricted to the context of FET claims. Even

law.
though, as Respondent correctly points out, the good faith principle is not in itself a
source of obligations, it may inform the analysis whether Respondent’s conduct

amounted to an expropriation.

The Tribunal also notes that the same conduct may violate, or be relevant in determin-
ing violations of, different provisions of a BIT, as Claimant argues. But the mere fact
that other standards may be violated by the same conduct does not necessarily mean
that the conduct constitutes an expropriation. Whether the FET standard, for example,
is violated and whether an expropriation has occurred require separate legal analyses,
independently conducted, even though they may involve the same factual conduct.

The Tribunal’s Approach to the Question of Expropriation

The Tribunal observes that the analysis whether certain conduct constitutes an expro-
priatory act cannot be carried out in an abstract manner, but rather must be based on
the specific facts of the case. It has to be noted that the Concession Contract was not
terminated by way of legislative act or executive decree, but rather by Respondent’s
exercise of negotiated contractual termination rights, on the grounds that Claimant al-
legedly failed to comply with its contractual obligations. In the Termination Letter,
Respondent did not purport to invoke any of its sovereign prerogatives. On its face,

*! Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, {| 29; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, | 27. Cf. Anthony D'Amato, “Good
Faith” in Encyclopedia of Public International Law, 1992, p. 600: “The principle of good faith is rooted in a
natural law conception of customary international law. [...] The principle of good faith thus owes its present
authoritative status to the natural law foundations of general international law, to customary international law

as derived from the articulation of that custom in numerous treaties [...]

Award Page -76-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

Respondent’s termination notice would therefore appear to be the act of an ordinary
contracting party rather than the act of a sovereign State.

313. In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that Respondent purported to exercise a contractual
right when terminating the Concession Contract does not exclude per se the possibility

3

that this conduct at the same time amounted to an expropriation. 2 Tn the given cir-

cumstances, it is clear that the Tribunal must consider the way in which the Conces-

sion Contract was concluded, performed and terminated to determine the expropriation

333

claim.””” At the same time, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that, by taking such con-

tractual matters into consideration, it will not determine contractual claims or exercise

334

jurisdiction under the Concession Contract;""" any findings that this Tribunal may

make in respect of the Concession Contract are relevant only as a part of the Tribunal’s

se: ; a. 33:
analysis of Claimant’s expropriation claim. 5

314. While the Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal in its expropriation analysis may take
into account the circumstances in which the Concession Contract was entered into, per-
formed and terminated, they do not agree on the subsequent question, which is whether
there can be a finding of expropriation in the event that Respondent, as it alleges, in
fact terminated the Concession Contract in accordance with its express terms and Hun-
garian law.

315. Primarily, it is Claimant’s case that Respondent’s termination of the Concession Con-
tract did not accord with its terms and was unlawful as a matter of Hungarian law.>*°
Claimant further contends, however, that, even assuming that the termination of the
Concession Contract was in accordance both with its terms and with Hungarian law,
this would not be dispositive of the Tribunal’s analysis of whether the termination
amounted to an expropriation.**” According to Claimant, the purported contractual
termination grounds were only a pretext and, in fact, Respondent terminated the Con-
cession Contract for public policy reasons, thus acting in its sovereign capacity, despite
the formal appearance of the Termination Letter.*** Moreover, Claimant contends that
the termination was a disproportionate response to the purported contractual breaches
and a “malicious exercise of a right, a fictitious exercise of a right and an abuse of
rights.”>°

316. By contrast, Respondent submits that it terminated the Concession Contract in accord-
ance with its terms and Hungarian law and asserts that a lawful termination cannot
constitute an expropriation of contractual rights.“° Respondent is of the view that,
even though the legality of the termination under Hungarian law is not dispositive of
Claimant’s expropriation claim, a State which is exercising its contractual right to ter-
minate a contract in accordance with its terms and governing law, without invoking its
sovereign powers, is “by definition conducting itself as an ‘ordinary contracting par-
ty. Respondent further contends that even a wrongful termination of a contract
concluded by a State is not expropriatory in nature “unless procured by sovereign con-
duct.”*?

317. The Tribunal notes that both Parties rely upon various precedents in support of their
respective positions with regard to the question whether a contract termination, which
was in accordance with its terms and its governing law, excludes the finding of an ex-
propriation. The Tribunal has reviewed those decisions and notes that there is common
ground insofar as all of the tribunals considered sovereign or governmental conduct on
the part of the State to be a necessary requirement for a finding of an expropriation. In
the words of the tribunal in Impregilo v. Pakistan, the State’s alleged conduct

its governing law to be relevant for their analysis of the expropriation claim. In the
case of Malicorp v. Egypt, the tribunal was of the view that, if the State

“had the right to discharge itself from the Contract pursuant to the
private law rules governing it, [...] it is unnecessary to examine
whether the [State] also took a measure under its public powers

of a contractual remedy may support the conclusion that there has been a treaty breach” and noted that it had
taken into account the contractual conduct of the State and concluded that the measures taken to terminate the

(‘measures de puissance publique’), not as a party to the Contract
but as a State.”

320. With regard to the claimant’s allegation in that case that the contractual grounds were
mere pretexts and that a change of government policy was the real reason for terminat-
ing the contract, the tribunal took this possibility into account and further stated:

“A contracting party cannot be prohibited from discharging itself
from a contract where it has legitimate reasons for doing so, even if,
indirectly, the measure suits its convenience and enables it to go
back on choices made earlier. Put another way, the first question to
ask is whether the reasons given by the Respondent in its letter of
termination justify the termination.”*"

321. The tribunal went on to find that that the principal contractual reason given by the
State was “sufficiently well founded”, it further considered the criticisms of the claim-
ant’s contractual performance raised in the letter of rescission to be “sufficiently plau-

sible” and concluded that the contractual reasons on which the State had relied “appear

serious and adequate.”**

322. The ad hoc annulment committee in Vivendi v. Argentina took the position that the
legality of the State’s conduct under national law does not exclude the finding of an
expropriation, but nevertheless considered it to be part of the expropriation analysis.
The committee noted that “[a] State may breach a treaty without breaching a contract,
and vice versa.”*? At the same time, the committee noted that “municipal law will of-

in favor of “tak[ing] into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there

has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law.”*°°

323. In the case of Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela, the tribunal did not expressly distin-
guish between the analysis of national and international law, but simply stated that the

claimant had violated the contract, which rendered the termination “both justified and
351

legitimate,” without giving an explanation as to the exact meaning of those terms.

The tribunal further observed that the contractual breaches concerned “material fac-

tors” in the initial selection of the claimant as the investor and held that the respond-

ent’s actions had been “/egitimate contractual responses to what the Tribunal consid-

ers to be contractual breaches.”***

324. The tribunal in Bayindir v. Pakistan first noted that “a breach of contract is neither a
necessary nor a sufficient condition for a breach of treaty,” but later held that “if the

the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, which pro-
vides:

“The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful
is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affect-
ed by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.”

At the same time, Prof. Schrijver argues that “a breach of the contract has [...] eviden-
tiary value for the purpose of establishing a breach of the treaty” and “may well be
taken into account” in the analysis of the expropriation claim.**5

Having considered the relevant case law cited by the Parties and also taking into ac-
count Prof. Schrijver’s opinion, the Tribunal is of the view that the question whether
Respondent’s termination of the Concession Contract was in accordance with both its
terms and Hungarian law is not dispositive of the Tribunal’s analysis whether an ex-
propriation occurred. The Tribunal rather agrees with the majority of the precedents
and Prof. Schrijver that, even though a finding that the termination violated the terms
of the Concession Contract or provisions of Hungarian law may be relevant to its ex-
propriation analysis, such a finding is neither necessary nor sufficient to conclude that
Article 4 of the Treaty was violated. In fact, the Tribunal notes that, even though some
tribunals appear to have taken a different view on this issue, they nevertheless did not
limit their analysis to purely contractual considerations. Rather, they included alleged
non-contractual motives for terminating the contract in their discussion on whether it
was “legitimate” or “reasonable” to terminate the contract in the respective circum-
stances.**°

The Tribunal will therefore begin its analysis by focusing on the key question: whether
— to put it in the words of Prof. Schrijver — Respondent “stepped out of the contractual

shoes”**"

and, in fact, acted in its sovereign capacity when it terminated the Conces-
sion Contract. Accordingly, the Tribunal will first examine whether, as alleged by
Claimant, Respondent had “a hidden political agenda,” which was the true reason for
its termination of the Concession Contract, meaning that Respondent in fact took this
decision in order to give effect to a change in government policy, and thus in its sover-
eign capacity. If this were not the case, this would exclude the finding of an expropria-
tion regardless of whether Respondent acted in accordance with the terms of the Con-

cession Contract and Hungarian law.?°8 However, even if the Tribunal were to con-
clude that Respondent indeed had public policy reasons to terminate the Concession
Contract, this would not necessarily in itself lead to a finding that the termination
amounted to an expropriation because Respondent could at the same time have had
contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract.

In the latter case, the Tribunal would therefore have to continue its analysis by examin-
ing, as a second step, whether contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Con-
tract in fact existed. In the Tribunal’s view, a finding that none of the contractual
grounds invoked by Respondent were sufficiently well-founded, while not being dis-
positive of the expropriation question in itself, could indicate that they were merely a
pretext designed to conceal a purely expropriatory measure. If, on the other hand, the
Tribunal were to reach the contrary conclusion, i.e., that Respondent had contractual
termination grounds in addition to its public policy reasons, this would require a fur-
ther analysis.

In the event of such a parallel cause (public policy reasons and contractual grounds),
the Tribunal would thus have to examine, as a third and final step, whether the contrac-

tual termination was legitimate, i.e., consistent with the good faith principle. To be

 

specific, the Tribunal would have to determine whether the termination constituted an
abuse of the contractual right in order to avoid liability to compensate, that is, whether
it involved a “fictitious” or “malicious” exercise of the right to terminate.

If the Tribunal were ultimately to conclude that it was indeed legitimate for Respond-
ent to invoke its contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract, this
would exclude a finding of an expropriation, despite the parallel existence of public
policy reasons. The issues for determining an expropriation in the context of a contract
termination are (i) whether the contract is terminated by the contractual procedure ra-
ther than a legislative act or executive decree, and (ii) whether there exists a legitimate
contractual basis for termination, i.e., (a) the contract or the governing law provides the
ground for termination, (b) the evidence substantiates a factual basis for invoking the
contractual ground, and (c) the State acts in good faith, not abusing its right by a ficti-
tious or malicious exercise of it.

*8 As stated by the tribunal in Suez v. Argentina, if the State did not act in the exercise of its sovereign powers,
but as an ordinary contracting party, “no expropriation has taken place and the Claimants have only contrac-
tual claims under the legal framework” by which the contract is governed. Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de

E. Did Respondent Have Public Policy Reasons for Terminating the Concession
Contract?

332. As noted above, the first question for the Tribunal to answer is whether it can con-
clude, on the basis of the evidence, that Respondent had public policy reasons for ter-
minating the Concession Contract, and thus acted in its sovereign capacity.

1. Summary of Claimant’s Position

333. Claimant submits that Respondent destroyed the Project through its sovereign conduct
and that the present dispute therefore does not arise out of Respondent’s ordinary good
faith regulation or commercial conduct. In this respect, Claimant states that, following
the signing of the Concession Contract and, in particular, following the election of the
new Fidesz Government, it became typical for Respondent to communicate with
Claimant via public statements and the media. Claimant refers to Dr. Budai’s an-
nouncement of the revocation of Special Project Status at a press conference a day be-
fore the Government Decree of 23 September 2010 was issued as well as Dr. Budai’s
announcement of the termination of the Concession Contract at a press conference
days prior to Respondent’s formal notification to KC Bidding. Claimant submits that
this is not the conduct of a good faith contractual counterparty.>?

334. According to Claimant, Dr. Budai’s pervasive role as an organ of the State, including
his central role in the termination of the Concession Contract, “embodies” Respond-
ent’s expropriatory intent.>

335. Claimant further submits that the application of international law principles of attribu-
tion demonstrates that Respondent was acting in its sovereign capacity and exercising
puissance publique when it terminated the Concession Contract.**!

336. Claimant asserts that both components of an internationally wrongful act, — (i) it must
be attributable to the State and (ii) it must constitute a breach of an international obli-
gation — are met in this case and that Respondent’s State organs were, by definition,
acting in a sovereign capacity.*°

337. Claimant refers to the case of Al-Kharafi v. Libya in which the tribunal held:

“The contract signed between the Plaintiff and the Libyan party was
preceded by a license from the Libyan Minister of Tourism, which
gives the parties participating a clear governmental character that
reinforces the Arbitral Tribunal’s conviction regarding the interven-
tion of Libyan government bodies in the contract conclusion, perfor-
mance and termination.”*”

In Claimant’s view, it is beyond serious argument that Respondent’s conduct was of a
governmental character, which is demonstrated, inter alia, by

- the extensive and frequent interaction between the Project Sponsors and Respond-
ent’s ministers, senior officials and officers throughout 2007-2009, culminating in
the signature of the Concession Contract;

- the active encouragement and support of the Project at all relevant levels of the
State;

- the award (and subsequent revocation) of Special Project Status and other State in-
centives; and

- the documented circumstances surrounding the termination of the Concession Con-
364
tract.

In this regard, Claimant asserts that the revocation of Special Project Status was “de-

liberately intended as a pre-cursor to the Respondent’s termination of the Concession

Contract and pursuit of financial penalties.”*°

Claimant relies on Dr. Budai’s statement in an interview on 27 October 2010:

“The government cancelled the special status of the project, so if they
wish to acquire any sort of permission or license they should do that
via the established procedures, which is a far longer process. The
conclusion is that they will not have any construction license or per-
mission; therefore the state can cancel the concession agreement on
the Ist of January 2011. In this case King City, represented by Joav
Blum, will have to pay the state a penalty of 900 million HUF?

341. Claimant further refers to two letters from Dr. Budai to Minister Matolcsy dated 5 Oc-
tober 2010°” and to Dr. R6za Nagy dated 6 January 2011,°% in which Dr. Budai
“pressed for the termination” of the Concession Contract, specifically noting that the
Ministry should give “special consideration to the fact that that the Special Project
Status of the King’s City investment was revoked by the government.”*

342. In Claimant’s view, the Government proposal for the revocation of Special Project
Status*”” was another reason why Dr. Budai in particular was “acutely aware” that that
the revocation would “severely impede” Claimant’s ability to comply with the contrac-
tual deadline.*”!

343. Claimant submits that Dr. Kardkovacs, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of Na-
tional Economy, “is another manifestation of the Fidesz government’s linkage between
the revocation of Special Project Status and termination of the Concession Con-
tract.”*"? Claimant refers to a letter from Dr. Kardkovacs to Mr. Langhammer dated 17
December 2010,*” in which he declared that the incentives package had “expired” (in-
stead of being “suspended,” as the Government had previously phrased it), and to the
Government proposal for the revocation of Special Project Status,?”4 prepared by Dr.
Kardkovacs.*”> Claimant contends that Dr. Kardkovacs’ “pervasive role” (alongside
that of Dr. Budai) confirmed Respondent’s view that the revocation of Special Project
Status, the withdrawal of incentives and the termination of the Concession Contract
were “closely linked.”*"°

344. Claimant submits that the revocation of Special Project Status, besides being a clear
signal that Respondent was no longer committed to the Project, made it “more difficult
(if not impossible) in practical terms’ to realize the Project.*”” Claimant contends that
Special Project Status was in fact cancelled to ensure that KC Bidding would be unable
to fulfil the conditions of the Concession Contract by 1 January 2011, which would in
turn give Respondent the right to cancel the Concession Contract.°78

Claimant concludes that the Fidesz Government had a political agenda behind termi-
nating the Concession Contract, with the aim of destroying the Project.*”° Claimant re-
fers in particular to:

led to the stonewalling of the Project Sponsors and the Project;**°

- the revocation of Special Project Status and the egregious manner in which this
was conducted;**!

- the suspension and cancellation of incentives promised to the Project;**?

- false changes in Government policy towards environmental protection and tourism
in Hungary;**° and

- the commencement of multiple penalty lawsuits against Mr. Lauder. 384
Summary of Respondent’s Position

Respondent submits that Claimant has failed to establish that the termination of the
Concession Contract was more than a legitimate contractual response to KC Bidding’s
contractual breaches.**° According to Respondent, Hungary terminated the Concession
Contract in its capacity as an ordinary contracting party, without invoking any of its
sovereign prerogatives.**°

Respondent submits that, on 21 December 2010, KC Bidding certified to the Ministry
of National Economy that SDI Europe had acquired lawful possession of, and the right
to build on, the Sukor6é Site.**” The Ministry, however, was advised by its external le-
gal counsel that, in view of the pending Land Swap Litigation, SDI Europe could not
have acquired such rights, and that the Ministry was accordingly entitled to terminate
the Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1. Respond-
ent refers to Dr. Réza Nagy’s witness statement, in which she stated: “[T]here was no

question that KC Bidding was in breach of the Concession Contract and that the Min-
99388

istry was accordingly entitled to terminate the Concession Contract on that basis.

348. Respondent further submits that, on 6 January 2011, the Ministry organized a working-
level meeting to discuss the proposed termination of the Concession Contract. In a
memorandum dated 7 January 2011, prepared for Minister Matolcsy, Dr. Kardkovacs
and Dr. K6résmezei explained that KC Bidding had failed to meet certain of its con-
tractual obligations and that the Ministry was accordingly entitled to terminate the
Concession Contract with immediate effect and claim frustration penalties.**” Re-
spondent further submits that the Legal and Codification Department of the Ministry of
National Economy thus recommended in this memorandum the termination of the
Concession Contract on the basis of those breaches and the Concession Contract was
accordingly terminated on 10 January 2011 3

349. Respondent emphasizes that the Termination Letter specifically refers to the grounds
for termination invoked by the Ministry and describes KC Bidding’s various breaches
of the Concession Contract, thus making it indistinguishable from a notice of termina-
tion that could have been sent by a private party.*°!

350. Respondent concludes that the termination of the Concession Contract was carried out
within the framework of the parties’ contractual relations, on the basis of purely con-
tractual considerations relating to KC Bidding’s contractual breaches.*”?

351.

With regard to Claimant’s assertion that Dr. Budai instigated and brought about Re-
spondent’s termination of the Concession Contract, Respondent acknowledges that Dr.
Budai had indeed written to the Ministry of National Economy on 5 October 2010 re-
questing that it “consider the termination of the Concession Contract on I January
2011.73 Respondent submits, however, that Dr. Réza Nagy explained to Dr. Budai
that as Claimant “ha[d] until the end of 2010 to comply with the relevant clauses, [and]
the termination of the concession contract, as of today, is untimely.”*°* Respondent
contends that Dr. Budai’s attempts to interfere with the Concession Contract were thus
“authoritatively shot down” by the Ministry of National Economy.*”

Respondent rejects Claimant’s suggestion that Dr. Budai expressed the view of the

0,°%° in which he linked the revocation

Government in his interview on 27 October 201
of Special Project Status to the termination of the Concession Contract. Respondent
asserts that Claimant quoted only part of the document to support its allegation that Dr.
Budai had proposed to Minister Fellegi to cancel the Concession Contract. Respondent
submits that Minister Fellegi does not recall being approached by Dr. Budai to discuss
the Concession Contract or the Sukoré transaction. In any event, Respondent refers to
Minister Fellegi’s first witness statement, in which he stated that “Dr. Budai was not a
member of the Cabinet and had no authority or influence over any decisions made by
the government.”*°"

Respondent further contends that both Dr. Budai and Claimant misunderstand the
scope of the revocation of Special Project Status, which had been limited in its applica-
tion to the implementation of the Project “in the outskirts of Sukoré.”?8 Respondent
submits that Special Project Status was Sukoré-specific and would not have been of
any assistance in securing an alternative Project site by the 1 January 2011 deadline.*”
In Respondent’s view, Claimant does not dispute that fact.‘ Respondent refers to Dr.
Ro6za Nagy’s testimony during the Hearing, in which she stated that Special Project
Status “would not have been revoked if the Sukor6 site had remained available for the
Project.”*"!

With regard to the Sukor6 Site, Respondent refers to Article 2(2) of Government De-
cree 83/2009 (IV.10)*” and the statement of its expert Prof. Kiraly that Special Project
Status could not have served to expedite the registration of Mr. Blum’s interest in the
Sukor6 Site because the Government Decree came into force after the registration pro-
cedure had already been initiated. Respondent submits that the revocation was thus
“inconsequential” to KC Bidding’s obligations to secure a Project site within the dead-
line and did not contribute in any way to the termination grounds.“

Respondent notes that the Government proposal for the revocation of Special Project
Status does not refer to the Concession Contract or the contractual deadline for secur-

ing a Project site.“ Respondent refers to Minister Fellegi’s first witness statement, in

which he stated that “[t]he termination of the Concession Contract was not raised in

the proposal for the revocation of the special project status and was not discussed dur-

ing the government session when the revocation was approved.”*°

356. Respondent states that Dr. Budai, who, as Respondent acknowledges, did indeed con-
nect the revocation of the Special Project Status and the termination of the Concession
Contract, was not involved in the process leading up to the revocation, as he did not
participate in the preparation of the Government proposal or the 16 September 2010
meeting of the Administrative Secretaries in which the proposal was approved.*°°

357. In response to Claimant’s allegation that Dr. Budai was a “vociferous critic of the Pro-
ject and the Project Sponsors,” Respondent submits that Dr. Budai was “indeed a ‘vo-
ciferous critic’, not of the Project, but of the Land Swap Agreement and of its direct

consequence: the implementation of the Project in Sukor6.” Respondent contends that

Dr. Budai referred to the Sukoré Site in all of his press interventions relied upon by

Claimant, which shows that his concerns related to the Land Swap Agreement and the

implementation of the Project in Sukoré, as well as “other Sukoré-related ancillary

matters such as the grant of the Sukor6-specific special project status and the Incen-

tives Agreement.”*""

358. Respondent asserts that the excerpt from the 27 October 2010 interview*”* confirms
that Dr. Budai always referred to the Sukoré land swap and that it demonstrates that
Dr. Budai did not know that Claimant intended to implement the Project elsewhere
than in Sukor6. Furthermore, Respondent is of the view that the interview shows that
Dr. Budai had no understanding of the reasons that led to the revocation of Special
Project Status and that the Sukor6-specific status could not assist Claimant in its search
for an alternative site. Respondent submits that this “demonstrates ad absurdum that
Dr. Budai cannot have played the role which the Claimant now lends him?

359. Respondent submits that Dr. Budai was only invited to participate in the 6 January
2011 meeting because KC Bidding had chosen to designate the Sukor6é Site as the Pro-
ject site and the Land Swap Agreement had therefore become very relevant in deter-

mining whether KC Bidding had complied with its obligation to lawfully acquire pos-
session of, and the right to build on, the Project site.4!°

360. Respondent emphasizes that neither the Termination Letter nor any of the Ministry’s
internal memoranda refer to the revocation of Special Project Status, which is, Re-
spondent submits, “for the simple reason that the special project status had no inci-
dence on the purported transfer of possession and the right to build on the Sukoro site
(or, for that matter, on the [sic] Vigotop’s and KC Bidding’s search for an alternative
Project site"! Respondent adds that Hungary never relied upon or otherwise referred

to the revocation to justify or defend the termination of the Concession Contract.*!

361.

Respondent concludes that there is no connection between the revocation of Special
Project Status and the termination of the Concession Contract and reiterates that it ter-
minated the Concession Contract for the simple reason that KC Bidding failed to se-

cure a Project site by the contractual deadline of 1 January 201 148

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

362. As noted above, it is Claimant’s case that the Fidesz Government had a “hidden politi-
cal agenda” behind terminating the Concession Contract and thereby destroying the
Project. According to Claimant, Respondent’s revocation of Special Project Status was
a key step in this agenda and was particularly egregious, given the manner in which it
was carried out. Claimant further submits that the Fidesz Government’s conflation of
the Land Swap Agreement and the Concession Contract led to the stonewalling of the
Project Sponsors and the Project and the withdrawal of its promises of financial and
other support. Claimant further submits that Respondent’s agenda to destroy the Pro-
ject was underpinned by changes in Government policy in relation to environmental
protection and tourism in Hungary. Claimant submits that Respondent’s “malicious in-
tent” was further evidenced by its commencement of multiple penalty lawsuits against
Mr. Lauder. In Claimant’s view, the Termination Letter was the final measure in a line
of wrongful exercises of sovereign power that cumulatively deprived Claimant of its
investment.*"* The Tribunal also notes that Mr. Langhammer testified he was offended

by this treatment and stated: “[I]n all my 40 years of experience, I’ve never been treat-
v4 15

ed like this by any Government.
363. The Tribunal recalls that its jurisdiction does not extend to determining a breach of the
FET standard; it will therefore express no view as to the fairness of Respondent’s con-
duct, including the Government’s imposition on Claimant or its surety Mr. Lauder of

“penalt[ies] for frustration’*'®

of the Concession Contract despite the fact that the new
Government had previously withdrawn its active support for the Project and had de-
termined by at least the fall of 2010 that, “[a]ccording to the new plans of the govern-
ment — based on environmental and touristic considerations — [the Project] shall not be
implemented at Sukor6.”""" Instead, the Tribunal must focus on the expropriation issue
and determine, as a first step, whether there is sufficient evidence that Respondent had
public policy reasons for terminating the Concession Contract, and thus whether it act-
ed in its sovereign capacity.

364. In reviewing the evidence submitted by the Parties in these proceedings, the Tribunal
has identified a number of pieces of evidence that it considers to be particularly perti-
nent to determining whether Respondent had public policy reasons for terminating the
Concession Contract. The Tribunal will examine this evidence in chronological order
below, grouping it into three different time periods:

 

i) the period prior to the signing
of the Concession Contract on 9 October 2009; (ii) the period between the signing of
the Concession Contract and the change of government, i.e., the assumption of office
by Dr. Orban, leader of the Fidesz Party, as Prime Minister on 29 May 2010; and (iii)
the period following the change of government. In addition, the Tribunal will examine
Dr. Budai’s actions following his appointment as Prime Minister’s Commissioner in
June 2010.

365. The Tribunal observes that to the extent certain statements were made by members of
the Fidesz Party while it was in opposition, they cannot be attributed to Respondent.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers such statements to be relevant in that they may in-
form the Tribunal’s conclusion as to the Government’s policy relating to casino pro-
jects in Hungary generally after the Fidesz Party took power on 29 May 2010.

366. As to Dr. Budai’s various statements, the Tribunal considers it necessary to distinguish
between the time periods before and after his appointment as Prime Minister’s Com-

missioner on 8 June 2010 and concludes that only the latter can be attributed to Re-

“18 the mere fact that Dr. Budai was a

spondent. Contrary to what Claimant alleges,
member of the supervisory board of a State organization — before Prime Minister
Orban appointed him as his Commissioner — is not sufficient to render his conduct at-
tributable to Respondent. However, contrary to Respondent’s contention,“”? Dr. Bu-
dai’s conduct following his appointment as Prime Minister’s Commissioner on 8 June
2010 can be attributed to Respondent. Prime Minister Orban appointed Dr. Budai his
Commissioner by way of a Government Decree*”® and Dr. Budai reported directly to
the Prime Minister. His position is also reflected in his official communications in
which he used the letterhead “OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER - DR. GYULA

BUDAT” followed either by “Prime Minister’s Commissioner?!

commissioner.”*™ In these circumstances, it is clear that the acts and statements of Dr.

or by “government

Budai in his capacity as the Prime Minister’s Commissioner are attributable to Re-
spondent.

367. In reviewing the evidence, the Tribunal will also determine whether Respondent had
public policy concerns relating to the Project as a whole, or whether any such concerns
were directed only at the establishment of the Project at Sukor6.

a) The Period Prior to the Signing of the Concession Contract

368. The first statement in the record documenting the Fidesz Party’s opposition to the Pro-
ject at Sukor6 is dated 15 August 2009. On that day, Mr. Istvan Balsai, Vice President
of the General Assembly of Fejér County and a member of the Fidesz Party, gave a

speech, in which he stated that they would “save the area of the Lake Velencei by pre-

venting [the King’s City] project.”?3

369. In a press conference also on 15 August 2009, Dr. Budai, then Association Director of
MAGOSZ (National Association of Hungarian Farmers’ Societies and Cooperatives),

uses the word “government commissioner” instead of “Prime Minister's Commissioner” and therefore suggests
that Dr. Budai used this title prior to his appointment as Government Commissioner on 9 November 2010, the
original Hungarian term “miniszterelndéki megbizott” is identical to the Hungarian term used in Exhibits C-383
and C-395. By contrast, the Hungarian term in Exhibit R-159 (dated 6 January 2011) is “elszdmoltatasi és
korrupcié-ellenes kormdnybiztos,” which confirms that Dr. Budai did not use the same title before and after his
appointment as Government Commissioner in November 2010.

announced that the Fejér County Chief Prosecutor’s Office had indicted Mr. Blum on
charges of forging public documents on the basis that Mr. Blum “was not habitually
residing or accessible at the home address which he specified.”*** Dr. Budai referred
to Mr. Blum as an “impostor” and a “fraudster” and further stated that there had been a
“series of fraud{s]” in relation to the Land Swap Agreement.*?°

In an interview on Echo TV on 17 August 2009, Dr. Budai stated that, as early as De-
cember 2008, he had voiced his suspicions of corruption in relation to the land swap
transaction to Mr. Tatrai, then CEO of the MNV, as well as to the chairman of the Au-
dit Committee of the Land Fund Management Agency. Dr. Budai reiterated that “we
are faced with serial fraud here” and stated that, due to the forgery of public docu-
ments by Mr. Blum, “the whole land swap can be considered legally invalid.”**

On 27 August 2009, Dr. Budai participated in a further press conference, at which he
stated that it was a “fact that the King’s City casino project in Sukoré [...] will not be
implemented.” In his view, “the Sukor6 project is a large-scale theft supported by the
government.” On this occasion, Dr. Budai also announced that, in the event of a
change in government, “every person [...] responsible for wasting several hundred
million Forints of the taxpayers in such a way, will be called to account."

On 28 August 2009, the Fidesz Party issued a press release, in which it cited Mr. Bal-
sai’s stating at a press conference: “No casino will be built here [at Sukor6]” because
the “processes around it are illegal.” Mr. Balsai further stated:

“[I]f so much as one single stone is turned in connection with this in-
vestment, the new government that would take office in a few months
will ‘undo it’ without legal consequences or any compensation to the
investors. [...] We wish to once again call upon the government, to
cancel this project for good and forget about ines

During the same press conference, another Fidesz politician, Mr. Andras Cser-
Palkovics, mentioned that there were, inter alia, “environmental problems,” which

were part of “the negative effects of this case on the sporting life of this area.”

374. On 18 September 2009, Dr. Orban, then leader of the opposition Fidesz Party, partici-
pated in an interview on HirTV and was asked about “the Sukor6 casino at Lake Ve-

lencei.”

“The situation is even worse than that. [...] I saw a whole map, a
campaign plan describing about seven or eight large casino cities
that they want to create in the country. [...] In Hungary’s economic

policy strategy, the goal to transform Hungary into a ‘casino coun-

try’, a gambling country, so that our country would have the largest
casino industry in Europe, this was not included in the government
99430

program. [...] This is a secret plan [...

In relation to the casino industry generally, Dr. Orban commented that:

375. With respect to Sukor6, Dr. Orban referred to Mr. Balsai’s statement of 28 August
2009 and stated:

“All I can say is what one of the parliamentary representatives of
FIDESZ has said: not even a single shovel of earth is worth moving
there. We will reinstate [...] I support the idea that, since we live ina
democracy, that we should have a meaningful discussion how Hun-
gary would want to fit in the global casino industry. Do we want to
be Europe’s casino dumping ground. [...] Let us discuss it. Not only
in Parliament, in general, and then let us make a decision in the mat-
ter. But this dispute has not taken place. No one has made a decision
about this matter, and this plan would fundamentally transform the
character of the Hungarian economy. In addition, this has several
ramifications related to public security, money laundering and quite
a few unclean issues. So for this reason, if I have the chance to par-
ticipate in this dispute, so far, I have not had the chance to do this, I
will stand for handling this gingerly [...] Hungary is not a casino
country.”

376. On 8 October 2009, i.e., one day before the Concession Contract was signed, Dr. Bu-
dai met with Dr. Oszk6 at the Ministry of Finance to discuss, among other things, the

377.

Land Swap Agreement.‘ At this meeting, Dr. Budai apparently urged the immediate

termination of the Land Swap Agreement, as he considered it “a void agreement.

On the same occasion Dr. Oszk6, then Minister of Finance, stated to journalists invited

“[T]he concerns in connection with the casino investment in Sukor6é
are related to the plot exchange agreement and the value propor-
tionality. [...] [the members of the Government] will try to reach
primarily the cheapest solution, from the aspect of the state and [...]
the termination has to be compared with all the other such possibili-
ties by which they could possibly reach a similar result, however, by
involving less risk for the State.” 3

 

b) The Period between the Signing of the Concession Contract and the Change of
Government

(i) _ Evidence Relating to Events Following the Signing of the Concession Contract

378. On 9 October 2009, two hours after the Concession Contract signing ceremony, the
Ministry of Finance issued a press release — without consultation with the Project
Sponsors, in which it stated that it would “make sure, that the MNV immediately starts
discussions with Joav Blum about the Sukoro land swap, with the aim of restoration of
the original — pre-land-swap-condition” and, in the event that the discussion was not
concluded within 30 days, that it would “give [an] order to [the] MNV to take the nec-
essary legal steps to invalidate the land-swap contract.” The press release also in-
formed the public that the land swap investigations within the Ministry of Finance
were ongoing and that the Concession Contract with KC Bidding had been signed. At
the same time, however, the Ministry stated in its press release that “the venue of [the]
project should be the Mid-Transdanubian region,” thus giving “[t]he investment group
[...] the opportunity to realize the casino project within the region in line with the law,
thus the contract does not provide for the exact venue of the investment.”

379. On 20 October 2009, Dr. Budai referred the land swap investigation to the Chief Pros-
ecutor’s Office, handing over documents that, in his view, showed that the Land Swap
Agreement had been concluded “disregarding the provisions of the property act.”

380. In a press conference on 18 November 2009, Dr. Budai requested that, in light of the
Fejér County Court’s final judgment that the home address of Mr. Blum had been ficti-
tious, Dr. Oszk6 immediately direct the MNV to “withdraw from the contract due to
its invalidity.” He further stated that, on the basis of this administrative judgment, “the
criminal court will establish the investor’s guilt of forgery of public documents” and

referred to Mr. Blum as “a common criminal.”**” Mr. Blum was ultimately acquitted

of maintaining a fictitious home address, and thus of forging public documents.***

Evidence Relating to the Alternative Site in Székesfehérvar

On 3 December 2009, the local government of Székesfehérvar decided to withdraw its
consent to the Project being implemented at its settlement, such consent having initial-
ly been given prior to the Tender.**” On 17 December 2009, Dr. Tbolya Balogh, Chair
of the Fejér County General Assembly and a member of the Fidesz Party, submitted a
proposal to the General Assembly containing an appeal to the 28 local governments of
Fejér County that had similarly given their consent to the Project prior to the Tender.
She requested “vigorously” that the governments:

“not support directly or indirectly the implementation of the ‘Catego-
ry I’ casino investment called King’s City questioning the belief in
the constitutional state, associated with governmental decisions
against the Constitution supervised by two Prime Ministers, protesta-
tions from the Public Prosecutor Departments, court cases that can
be associated with the investment — seriously involving the criminal
responsibility — against persons belonging to business and govern-
mental circles that are in contact or can be associated with the inves-
tor company, and withdraw their previous theoretical agreement —
considering the public law obstacles, initiated court cases and pros-
ecutors’ protestations meanwhile arisen.”“°

On 15 January 2010, the newspaper Magyar Hirlap published a news article with the
title “King’s City: Will it be established in Székesfehérvar instead of Sukor6?” accord-
ing to which the Concession Company had now been established at Székesfehérvar.
The article also informed the public that Clause 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract pro-
vided that the Concession Company was required to be established within the adminis-
trative area of the locality where the concession activity would be exercised. Accord-
ing to the article, Mr. Andras Cser-Palkovics, assistant spokesman for the Fidesz Party,

had commented to the newspaper that “his party had opposed this investment project

from the first moment.”

Following a letter of complaint from Mr. Gaye to Dr. Oszk6 of 26 February 2010 re-

1,4 Dr. Oszk6 wrote

garding the withdrawal of consent by the Székesfehérvar Council
on 8 March 2010 to Dr. Viktor Boka, the Székesfehérvar Council’s notary, and en-
closed a copy of this letter in his response to Mr. Benkley of the same date.*? In the
letter to Dr. B6ka, Dr. Oszk6 stated that there was no legal provision that would allow
for the withdrawal of the Council’s consent to the establishment of the Project at its

settlement. Dr. Oszk6 instructed Dr. Béka as follows:

“Since the decision of the withdrawal cannot be considered as a
statement capable of exerting a direct effect on the concession
agreement, the settlements listed in Annex I to the concession con-
tract, including Székesfehérvar, continue to be available as possible
premises for the exercise of the activity subject to the concession.“

On 6 April 2010, i.e., five days before the national elections took place, the Fidesz
Party issued a press release concerning the potential location of the Project at
Székesfehérvar:

“Székesfehérvar is the City of Kings and not that of King’s City.
Fidesz is protesting because the Minister of Finance did not accept
the decision of Székesfehérvar’s local government by which it with-
drew its support to the casino concession agreement [...] Following
the initiative of Fidesz, the local government of Székesfehérvar de-
cided to withdraw its permit.”

 

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Dr. R6za Nagy, State Secretary at the Ministry of
National Economy, testified at the Hearing in response to a question from the Tribunal
whether casino projects were being disfavored by the Fidesz Government as a form of
a touristic project for the country:

“With regard to the future, yes, they were disfavored by the Govern-
ment. Nevertheless, the Government respected the validity of con-
tracts that had been concluded before but we stated that we would
not assign [sic] similar contracts in the future. However, contracts

that had been signed by the previous Government were fully respect-
ed, were regarded as fully valid by the Government.”

386. The Tribunal further notes that, in his letter to Mr. Langhammer dated 17 December
2010, i.e., in the critical phase preceding the expiration of the contractual deadline on 1
January 2011 and in response to Mr. Langhammer’s letter to Prime Minister Orban
dated 24 November 2010,” Dr. Kardkovacs, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of
National Economy, also stated in clear terms:

“The Government of the Hungarian Republic is going to proceed
pursuant to the referring and effective legal stipulations and the pro-
visions of the [Concession] agreement.”*8

(iii) Evidence Relating to the Political Campaign Against Former Prime Minister
Gyurcsany

387. In his witness statement, Mr. Lauder stated that, on 20 February 2010, he met with Dr.
Orban, then leader of the opposition party, because, “by this time, [...] it was clear that
Dr. Orban would become the next Prime Minister of Hungary.”*” Mr. Lauder had re-
quested this meeting “following the publication of a series of hostile articles in the
Hungarian media in the run-up to the national elections that engaged in anti-Semitic
and other criticism of the Project and the Project Sponsors.” He stated:

“Tt was evident that Fidesz was behind these media attacks, since
they were using the Project to undermine the Socialist opposition
and, in particular, former Prime Minister Gyuresdny.”*°

388. In this regard, former Prime Minister Gyurcsany stated in his witness statement:

“[T]he early, relatively low-level, civic position to the King’s city
project was soon seized upon by the Fidesz opposition party and its
leadership for political purposes. The Fidesz party, as part of its po-
litical agenda, playing nationalist chords, launched a series of at-
tacks against all forms of foreign investment in Hungary. The King’s
city project was not the only target of this campaign, but it soon be-
came a focal point of it. This is because Fidesz and its leader, Dr.

gary) identified my encounter with the King’s city project backers at
the meeting of 21 May 2008 as a good opportunity to attack me polit-
ically”?!

389. According to Mr. Lauder’s recollection of his 20 February 2010 meeting with Dr.
Orban, he expressed to Dr. Orban that, in his view, “the criticism being levelled at the
Project was entirely unfair’ and that he did not believe that “the Prime Minister in-
waiting of Hungary would ultimately consider it sensible to pass up the great oppor-

tunity to bring this Project to the country.”*?

Dr. Orban apparently only responded

that he would “ook into” Mr. Lauder’s concerns and added “that ‘certain people’ were

opposed to the land swap and did not want the Project to succeed.” In Mr. Lauder’s

view, it was clear from this reaction that Dr. Orban “had no desire to lend support to

the Project.”** 3

390. However, Mr. Lauder stated in his oral testimony that he still believed after his meet-
ing with Dr. Orban on 20 February 2010 that, “after the election [Dr. Orban] would, in

fact, change his mind and allow [the Project] to go ahead.”*™*

391.

In a press release of 26 March 2010, the Fidesz Party announced that it would initiate
investigations into several projects in which it suspected corruption. This “/0+J” list
included “Sukoré.”*° The “accountability list’ expressly referred to the casino in-
vestment in Sukor6 and attacked in particular the approval of Special Project Status by

the previous Government.**°

After the Fidesz Party won the national elections on 11 April 2010, Mr. Balsai, acting
in his capacity as legal manager of Fidesz’s president staff, gave a press conference on
20 April 2010 entitled “Gyurcsdny and the Sukoro theft.” Mr. Balsai stated that the
Fidesz Party would begin investigations into the cases in respect of which it suspected
corruption, including the “Sukoro land speculation and land exchange.” He stated:

“[W]e will investigate in details [sic] the Sukoro land exchange and
real estate swindle; the scandalous theft of public assets which would
have happened in Sukoro if the case hadn’t been stopped, partly as a

result of our intervention, partly owing to the actions of the prosecu-

tors.

Former Prime Minister Gyurcsany stated in this context:

“It became clear to me at that point [following the 20 April 2010
press conference] that the Fidesz leadership had identified the King’s
city project as a means to persecute me and end my political career
in Hungary.”**

According to Mr. Langhammer’s recollection:

“[T]he Fidesz party has been trying to assert that corruption took
place between the Project Sponsors and the former Socialist Gov-
ernment, principally in order to discredit the former Prime Minister,
Mr. Ferenc Gyuresdny.”*?

On 10 May 2010, Dr. Balogh, the Fidesz-connected Chair of the Fejér County General
Assembly, participated in a discussion with the newspaper Magyar Hirlap. She re-

ferred to the “casino project of Sukor6” as “a crime, not only against Velence and
Fejér County, but the whole Hungarian nation.” In her view, “the casino city would
have annexed the whole northern beach of the lake” and would have “potential tragic
environmental impacts on the lake itself and the flora and fauna of the neighbour-
hood.” Dr. Balogh referred to the Project as “an entertainment monster” and to the
workplaces to be created as “modern-age degrading slavery” and stated: “[l]et’s keep

rather the natural character of the lake."

The Period Following the Change of Government

On 8 June 2010, following his assumption of office as Prime Minister of Hungary on
29 May 2010, Dr. Orban appointed Dr. Budai to the position of “commissionaire of the

 

prime minister rest ible for the investigation of the unlawful sale and privatiz

of state lands.”*°! According to a news article by Magyar Nemzet of 9 June 2010,
Dr. Budai was to investigate “the previous government’s scandalous cases in state
owned land sales (cases that are suspected to involve criminal acts),” including the
cases of Babolna and Sukor6.*” In a news article by Magyar Hirlap published on 16

June 2010, Dr. Budai stated that his “primary task will be to explore the Sukoré land
swap and the sale of the state-owned lands at Babolna.”** According to Respondent,
the land swap transaction at Sukor6 was high on the list of cases to be investigated by
Dr. Budai due to “the highly suspicious circumstances surrounding the Land Swap

Agreement and the media attention that it had attracted."

397. According to a news article from the Budapest Times dated 19 July 2010, former

Prime Minister Gyurcsany became the focus of the newly-elected Fidesz Govern-
ment’s campaign to “hold to account” the former administration. The article further
stated:

“[T]he appointment of a prime ministerial commissioner to look into
the Sukor6 case is in line with the commitment by Orbdn and the
Fidesz government to ‘hold to account’ politicians and public figures
suspected of corruption during the eight years that the Socialists
were in government.”*®

398. On 28 July 2010, Dr. Budai delivered a press conference at which he accused former

Prime Ministers Bajnai and Gyurcsany of having “testified falsely before the prosecu-

tion” in the “Sukor6é” case.*°° The former Prime Ministers both reacted to this accusa-
tion by suing Dr. Budai, on 12 August 2010, for defamation and infringement of their

tights to privacy.*°7 They later prevailed in those cases.“

399. On 9 September 2010, Prime Minister Orban stated in an interview with Inforddio that,

as regards the casino city planned in Sukor6: “[I]t’s a dead case. It will soon take its

place in the criminal chronicles.”*

400. On 13 September 2010, Dr. Andras Schiffer, leader of the green liberal Party (LMP),

by the Government for the Lake Velence region and requested the revocation of the

Dr. Matolcsy, Minister of National Economy, gave a speech in Parliament in which he
announced:

“There will be no casino at Sukor6. We all know that. [...] there will
be no casino town or manufacturing town round the Lake Velence.
[...] clever, relaxing investment will take place at Lake Velence
which will help the national tourism and which will be a jewel of the
domestic tourism. [...] I have given an order to revoke the special
project status.*"'

401. On 14 September 2010, Minister Matolcsy issued a proposal for the Government on
the revocation of the Project’s Special Project Status. The proposal represents a formal
government document indicating its position on Special Project Status. It stated in rel-
evant part:

“According to the new plans of the government — based on environ-
mental and touristic considerations — the casino town shall not be
implemented at Sukor6. Instead, [...] such developments and chang-
es shall take place which can provide a real possibility of recreation
and resting.

Public policy aim of the proposal

The proposal aims at putting an end to the land speculation in the
region of Lake Velencei. It also aims at revoking the special project
status of the investment planned to be implemented in the outskirts of
Sukor6.”*”*

402. Minister Fellegi also stated in his second witness statement:

“[T]he development of a mega-casino on the shores of Lake Velence
would have been inconsistent with the policy of the new government
to protect such sites and to promote ‘green tourism’. The revocation
of special project status was therefore in line with the government’s
touristic and environmental policy."

403. However, at the same time, Minister Fellegi stated:

4° Exhibit R-94. The Tribunal notes that this proposal was unanimously supported by the Secretaries of State
during their meeting on 16 September 2010. On 23 September 2010, Prime Minister Orban signed Government
Decree 240/2010 (IX.23.) revoking the Project's Special Project Status; the Decree was approved by the Gov-
ernment at its 10 November 2010 session. Exhibits R-146, C-182 and C-320; Nagy, ff 15-17.

“[I]t made no sense to keep the special project status in Sukoré when
the position of the government was that the land swap was null and
void. In this context, the decision to revoke the special project status
[...] was a natural move. In my view, this should have been done by
the prior government which had referred the Sukoré land swap
transaction to the Hungarian courts.” v4

404. Dr. R6za Nagy also explained in her witness statement that the revocation was based in
part on the fact that “the implementation of the Project in Sukor6é was in contradiction
with environmental goals.” She further stated that she was advised in that context that
“the legal requirements to maintain the Sukor6-specific special project status [were]
absent considering that the land swap transaction at Sukor6é was null and void."

d) Dr. Budai’s Actions Following His Appointment as Prime Minister’s Commis-

sioner

405. The Tribunal has also carefully reviewed the various acts and statements of Dr. Budai
following his appointment as Prime Minister’s commissioner on 8 June 2010.

406. Ina press conference on 22 September 2010, i.e., before the revocation of the Project’s
Special Project Status was officially announced, Dr. Budai referred to the last session
of the Gyurcsany Government on 8 April 2009 in which the status had been granted to
the Project, and stated that, in the preparatory document intended for that session, “the
competent person of the then Ministry of Finance drew the attention to the fact that
there is no legal grounds for classifying [the Project] a high priority investment from a
national point of view, and he has suggested to the cabinet that the approval for the
proposal should be postponed. However, the government has brought its decision in
the matter.” Dr. Budai further stated that Special Project Status should not have been
granted by the previous Government, as the “/egal conditions” had never been in place
because the Concession Contract had not been signed at the time the status was grant-
ed. Similarly, he considered that “the allocation of HUF 2.6 billion to the investor, as
a state support [was] without any legal grounds.” Dr. Budai concluded that former
Prime Ministers Gyurcsany and Bajnai both “must have known about these facts” and

“their actions may be deemed as abuse of power.” 476

“°° Exhibit C-169.

407. Ina letter to Minister Matolcsy dated 5 October 2010, Dr. Budai referred to “[t]he full
scale investigation of the King’s city investment” and quoted from various provisions
of the Concession Contract. He concluded:

“The acquisition of the Sukor6 properties for the activity described
by the concession contract within the deadline is very doubtful at the
moment, since there is an ongoing lawsuit to revoke the Sukor6-
Albertirsa land swap agreement and to reinstate the original condi-
tions.

Based on the foregoing, please consider the termination of the con-
cession contract on I January, 2011, with special consideration to
the fact that the special project status of the King’s city investment
was revoked by the government.”

408. Dr. R6za Nagy responded to Dr. Budai’s letter by letter of 17 November 2010:

“We have examined all grounds for termination set out in concession
contract concluded between the Ministry of Finance and KC Bidding
Kft. on 9 October 2009 — including the ones referenced in your letter
—and we have found that the concession contract shall be terminated
only after I January 2011, on the condition that the Concession Re-
ceiver fails to comply with the clauses referenced in your letter.
However, since the Concession Receiver has until the end of 2010 to
comply with the relevant clauses, the termination of the concession
contract, as of today, is untimely.”*”*

409. On 27 October 2010, Dr. Budai participated in an interview with Magyar Demokrata
magazine, in which he linked the revocation of Special Project Status with the poten-
tial termination of the Concession Contract:

“[I]f [the Project Sponsors] wish to acquire any sort of permission or
license they should do that via the established procedures, which is a
far longer process. The conclusion is that they will not have any con-
struction license or permission; therefore the state can cancel the
concession agreement on the 1 of January 2011. In this case King
City [...] will have to pay the state a penalty of 900 million HUF.”*”

410. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Réza Nagy stated in her witness statement
that she considered that the revocation of Special Project Status would have “no con-

sequences [...] on Hungary’s obligations to the King’s city investors and “no inci-

dence on the Concession Contract.”**!

411.

Minister Fellegi stated in his first witness statement:

“The termination of the Concession Contract was not raised in the
government proposal for the revocation of the special project status
and was not discussed during the government session when the revo-
cation was approved.”**

412. Following the expiration of the contractual deadline on 1 January 2011, in an interview
with Magyar Nemzet on 5 January 2011, Dr. Budai stated that “the government’s

standpoint is clear: there will not be a casino in Sukor6.” In his view, the fact that the

Project Sponsors had named the Sukoré Site as the final site for the Project was “noth-
ing better than a joke.” According to Dr. Budai, “the concession right of the investor of
King’s City automatically expired on I January 2011” and KC Bidding would now
have to pay HUF 900 million as penalty fees to the Hungarian State.“

413. On 6 January 2011, Dr. Budai participated in a working-level meeting with representa-
tives of the Government, in which the possibility of terminating the Concession Con-

tract and the State’s claim for a penalty for frustration were discussed.** In a letter to

Dr. Réza Nagy of the same day, Dr. Budai cited various provisions of the Concession
Contract and explained why he considered them to have been breached. He concluded:

“Based on the foregoing, and with due consideration to the fact that
the deadline stipulated in the concession contract is overdue, I re-
peatedly request [sic] the termination of the concession contract with
immediate effect, with special consideration to the fact that the spe-

terminate the Concession Contract.” Nagy, | 44. Respondent does not contest, however, that this meeting took

ment commissioner Gyula Budai.” Exhibit R-160.

cial project status of the King’s City investment was revoked by the
government.”

414. On7 January 2011, the newspaper Magyar Nemzet reported that the Concession Con-

 

oner Dr. Budai

 

tract was “likely to be cancelled” and referred to government commi

who had told the paper after a meeting at the Government Audit Office the day before

that “representatives of the affected ministries and the audit office were in agreement

that the contract should be cancelled’ because Mr. Blum and KC Bidding “have failed

to meet the conditions included in the concession contract.”**°

415. On 8 January 2011, the Fidesz Party issued a press release, according to which Dr.
Budai said: “Jn Sukoré no casino city is going to be built, neither now, nor in the fu-
ture” and further that he had turned to Minister Matolcsy on 5 January 2011 “with the
issue to terminate immediately the concession agreement.” Dr. Budai announced that
“Tt]his termination is going to be made in writing during the next week” and added that
he had requested that the Minister demand the contractual penalty of HUF 900 million.
Dr. Budai concluded:

“With investors who intend to outmaneuver the regulations, or ignor-
ing them, and who wish to validate their individual interests at the
expense of others, the government does not wish to negotiate, neither
now nor in the future. The fact is that the management of KC Bidding
and King’s City belongs to this circle."

e) The Tribunal’s Evaluation of the Evidence

416. The Tribunal cannot but note the strong attacks on the Project at Sukoré and the some-
times inflammatory language employed by Dr. Budai and certain other representatives
of the Fidesz Party. Many of the incidental actors in this case brought and won defa-
mation actions in the courts of Hungary against Dr. Budai for some of his public
statements, including Dr. Klara Horvath (Mayor of Babolna),*** Mr. Mikl6és Tatrai

485 Exhibit R-159. Dr. R6za Nagy stated in her witness statement that Dr. Budai’s letter was located in the
archives of the Ministry of National Economy, even though she had “no recollection of receiving this letter.”

Mayor of Babolna’s reputation, and ordered the Fidesz Party and Dr. Budai to publish the judgment on the
Fidesz Party’s website for at least 30 days and to express their regret over the violations of Hungarian law and
to pay damages. Exhibits C-143 and C-311.

(former CEO of the MNV)** and former Prime Ministers Bajnai and Gyurcsany.*”°
Ultimately, Dr. Budai was dismissed from his position as the Prime Minister’s Com-
missioner as of 31 August 2012.""! The Tribunal notes the foregoing in evaluating the
evidence, without losing sight of the fact that many of these statements were made in
the context of the upcoming national elections in April 2010.

In summary, the above evidence shows that the Fidesz Government had essentially
three reasons for opposing the realization of the Project at Sukor6. First, the Govern-
ment suspected corruption in connection with the Land Swap Agreement. Second, it
adopted the position that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void — building upon
the actions of the MNV under the interim Government of Prime Minister Bajnai,
which had initiated a lawsuit before the Hungarian courts in November 2009 to “re-
store the original status.” Third, the Government had developed new environmental
and eco-tourism policies applicable to the Lake Velence region. The Tribunal is of the
view that, if established, the environmental and touristic policies and the anti-
corruption concerns would constitute true public policy reasons for opposing the im-
plementation of the Project at Sukor6. The Tribunal will therefore discuss these possi-
ble reasons in detail.

The Anti-Corruption Concerns

As regards the anti-corruption concerns, the above evidence shows that the Fidesz Par-
ty had made the fight against suspected corruption in the former Socialist Government,
including the interim Government of Prime Minister Bajnai, a major issue of its elec-
tion campaign and that Sukor6 was one of the cases on its “/0+/” list to be investigat-
ed after the change of government. The record shows that, once in office, Prime Minis-
ter Orban appointed Dr. Budai as his Commissioner “responsible for the investigation
of the unlawful sale and privatization of state lands.”*”? Not only did this investigation
include Sukor6é and the Land Swap Agreement, but Dr. Budai regarded this particular
case as a priority task.

4° On 17 July 2012, the Metropolitan Court ordered Dr. Budai to publicly apologize and pay damages to Mr.
Tatrai for falsely accusing Mr. Tatrai of accepting funds related to the Babolna case. Exhibit C-174.

#9 On 27 September 2012, the Court of Budapest Region ordered Dr. Budai to publicly apologize to former
Prime Ministers Bajnai and Gyurcsdny and to pay HUF 300,000 to each of them for the damage caused to their
reputations by stating at a press conference on 28 July 2010 that there were documents proving that the former
Prime Ministers had witnessed falsely in the prosecution. Exhibit C-312.

419.

421.

(ii)

422.

In the Tribunal’s view, these documents evidence that the allegations of corruption
were not only a major issue in the Fidesz election campaign, but continued to be an
important political reason for the Fidesz Government’s opposition to the implementa-
tion of the Project at Sukor6.

The Tribunal notes at this point that none of the allegations of corruption were ulti-
mately proven and the investigations into former Prime Minister Gyurcsany relating to
the crime of abuse of administrative authority were terminated on 30 July 2012 “be-
cause of failure to prove.” The Tribunal also notes that Dr. Csaszy and Mr. Tatrai of
the MNV, who were at one time arrested and detained after the Fidesz Government
took power,*”* were ultimately never charged with corruption in connection with the
land swap.*”°

Nevertheless, the above evidence shows that anti-corruption, in particular relating to
the Sukor6é land swap (even if unfounded), constituted a public policy concern of the
Fidesz Government and that, after the Concession Company certified Sukor6é as the
Project site, such public policy concern may well have played a role in the Govern-
ment’s decision to terminate the Concession Contract. In particular, Dr. Budai’s state-
ments following the expiration of the contractual deadline on 1 January 2011 and his
apparent involvement in the decision-making process leading up to the termination on
10 January 201 1°” indicate that the suspicions of corruption, which were his primary
concern as Prime Minister’s Commissioner investigating into the Sukoré land swap,
may have influenced the Government’s decision to terminate the Concession Contract
after it had become certain that the Project Sponsors intended to implement the Project
at Sukoré (based on the very land swap that Dr. Budai was tasked to investigate).

New Environmental and Touristic Policies

As to the environmental and touristic policy reasons, the Tribunal notes that most of
the documents submitted as evidence by Claimant specifically relate to Sukoré; there
are only a few pieces of evidence that could suggest a broader public policy against ca-
sino projects in Hungary generally.

423. As regards the statements of local politicians of Fejér County,*””

even though their
language does not always appear to be limited to the implementation of the Project at
Sukor6é, it seems reasonably clear from the context in which those statements were
made that the concerns of those politicians related primarily to the future of the Lake

Velence region.

424. By contrast, the comments made by Dr. Orban, then leader of the opposition party,
during a TV interview on 18 September 2009, (i.e., before the Concession Contract
was signed), ”* do reveal an aversion on his part (and by extension the Fidesz Party) to
the concept of a casino industry in Hungary.

425. In addition, there is evidence relating to the potential alternative site in Székesfehérvar.
The Tribunal notes that, while the resolution proposed by Dr. Balogh on 17 December
2009? was never passed and her opinion therefore cannot necessarily be taken to re-
flect the position of the Fejér County General Assembly, the statement made by
Mr. Cser-Palkovic as assistant spokesman for the Fidesz Party on 15 January 2010°°

and, in particular, the press release issued by the Fidesz Party on 6 April 2010," in
which it refers to its own “initiative” that led the local government of Székesfehérvar
to withdraw its consent to the Project, do suggest that the Fidesz Party actively sought
to ensure that Székesfehérvar would not be available as a Project site and thus also
suggest that it was opposed to the Project as a whole.

426. However, the Tribunal must have regard to the context in which those comments and
statements were made. As the interview with Dr. Orban was conducted while the
Fidesz Party was in opposition, Dr. Orban’s statements formed part of a legitimate po-
litical discourse concerning the casino industry in Hungary, which was inevitably
heightened in the campaign preceding the national elections. The statements relating to
the Székesfehérvar site likewise need to be assessed against this background. The Tri-
bunal further notes that the opposition of the Fidesz Party clearly did not reflect the
position of the interim Government, as evidenced by Dr. Oszk6’s letter to the mayor of
Székesfehérvér dated 8 March 2010.°° In the Tribunal’s view, Dr. Oszk6’s letter
shows that the interim Government of Prime Minister Bajnai still supported the Pro-
ject’s realization at alternative sites, including Székesfehérvar. This position is also

428.

confirmed by the press release issued by the Ministry of Finance on 9 October 2009,

i.e., the day the Concession Contract was signed.*

The press release shows that, even
though the interim Government sought to restore the pre-swap conditions with regard
to the Sukor6 Site, it contemplated that the Project was still viable and that the Project

Sponsors could realize the Project at one of the other possible locations.

While the Tribunal is of the view that the statements made by members of the Fidesz
Party while in opposition may nevertheless be relevant to interpret the actions of the
Fidesz Government after it took power on 29 May 2010, it also observes that, as the
statements of the Fidesz Party were made in the course of an election campaign, one
cannot simply assume that they would represent the official position of the Fidesz Par-
ty once in government. Experience shows that a political party may, by the very fact of
being in opposition, make statements which it would not actually follow as an elected
governing party, since it then becomes responsible for complying with the State’s ex-
isting obligations. In particular, Dr. Réza Nagy’s testimony indicates that, even though
the new Government might have been opposed to casino projects such as the Project in
the future, it was committed to respect those contracts that had already been conclud-
ed.™ This approach of the Fidesz Government is confirmed by Dr. Nagy’s letter to Dr.
Budai dated 17 November 2010, in which she stated that the Concession Contract
would only be terminated “on the condition that the Concession Receiver fails to com-
ply with the [contractual] clauses referenced in [Dr. Budai’s] letter.” Dr. Kardko-
vac’s letter of 17 December 2010 to Mr. Langhammer also shows that the Government
intended to proceed pursuant to the provisions of the Concession Contract.°°°

In the Tribunal’s view, those clear statements as to the new Government’s commitment
to respect the Concession Contract are not refuted by Dr. Orbdn’s statement in an in-

terview on 9 September 2010, referring to the “casino city planned in Sukor6” as “a
dead case.”*"' Even though the Tribunal considers this statement to be unequivocal ev-
idence that Dr. Orban, and by extension the Fidesz Government, was opposed to the
establishment of the Project at Sukord, the Tribunal notes that the precise context in
which Dr. Orban made this statement is unclear. It cannot be discerned from the doc-

ument whether Dr. Orban had been questioned as to the Project as a whole and re-

stricted his remarks to Sukoré, or whether he was only questioned about Sukor6 in the
first place. As a result, the evidence is ambiguous.

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no conclusive evidence in the record that the new Gov-
ernment adopted a general policy against the implementation of the Project in Hunga-
ty, i.e., that the Fidesz Government sought to prevent the Project from being realized
regardless of the site that Claimant may have chosen — the “hidden political agenda” to
destroy the Project alleged by Claimant.

On the other hand, the evidence does show that, while the Fidesz Party was mainly
focused on the suspicions of corruption during its election campaign, once it was in
power, it developed new environmental and touristic policies applicable to the Lake
Velence region.

The new environmental and touristic policies first led to the revocation of the Project’s
Special Project Status. Minister Matolcsy’s proposal for the Government on the revo-
cation of Special Project Status, which was unanimously approved at the meeting of
the Secretaries of State,>"* described the new Government’s position towards the Pro-
ject in the following terms:

 

“According to the new plans of the government — based on
environmental and touristic considerations — the casino town shall not be implemented
at Sukor6."°°

In this context, the Tribunal has also looked at Dr. Budai’s interview of 27 October
2010.°!° The statement could indeed suggest, as argued by Claimant,” that the Gov-
ermment cancelled the Special Project Status in order to make it impossible for the Pro-
ject Sponsors to secure any site for the Project by | January 2011, which would in turn
give Respondent the right to terminate the Concession Contract.

However, the Tribunal notes that the termination of the Concession Contract is not
mentioned in Minister Matolcesy’s proposal for the revocation and, according to Minis-
ter Fellegi, it was not discussed in the Government session in which the revocation was
approved.>! Dr. R6za Nagy also stated in her witness statement that the she did not
consider the two events to be linked.*!?

The Tribunal further observes that the Project’s Special Project Status related only to
the implementation of the Project “in the outskirts of the community of Sukor6.”>"4 The
Tribunal therefore agrees with Respondent that the status “could have been of no assis-
tance in the search for an alternative Project site and thus had no impact on KC Bid-
ding’s ability to comply with the contractual deadline to secure a Project site? in

any of the 132 alternative settlements.

Moreover, the Tribunal has not seen evidence sufficient to establish that Dr. Budai
played any role in the process leading up to the revocation of Special Project Status.
Claimant does not contend that Dr. Budai was involved in the preparation of the pro-
posal for the Government or that he participated in the 16 September 2010 meeting of
the State Secretaries or the 10 November 2010 session of the Government. Claimant
only relies on a document summarizing Dr. Budai’s press conference of 22 September
2010°'° and asserts that it was he who announced the revocation of Special Project Sta-
tus on this occasion, i.e., one day before the Government Decree was signed by Prime
Minister Orban.

However, in the Tribunal’s view, the document referred to by Claimant does not sup-
port this allegation. Rather, properly understood, the statement quoted by Claimant that
“the government has brought its decision in the matter”>'” does not refer to the deci-
sion to revoke Special Project Status, but rather to the decision by which the previous
Government initially granted Special Project Status to the Project in April 2009.58 In
any event, the document does not prove that Dr. Budai influenced the Government’s
decision to revoke Special Project Status.

The Tribunal notes that Minister Fellegi also stated in his first witness statement that
he had “no recollection of being approached by Dr. Budai to discuss this matter” and
further that Dr. Budai had “no authority or influence over any decisions made by the
government.”>'

Dr. R6za Nagy similarly stated in her witness statement that “Dr. Budai had no influ-
ence whatsoever on the decisions that were taken by the Ministry with regard to the
Project.”>° She referred in particular to Dr. Budai’s request to terminate the Conces-

and stated that this request was re-

viewed by the Ministry, which concluded that “the Ministry was not entitled to termi-

nate unless and until KC Bidding fails to comply with its obligation.”>? This is also

confirmed by her response to Dr. Budai of 17 November 2010.°73

439. In the Tribunal’s view, Claimant has not established that Dr. Budai took part in the
decision-making process regarding the revocation of Special Project Status. Conse-
quently, the Tribunal cannot conclude from the evidence that the Government’s deci-
sion to revoke Special Project Status was necessarily taken in order to make it impos-
sible for the Project Sponsors to secure an alternative Project site by the contractual
deadline of 1 January 2011, as suggested by Dr. Budai’s statement of 27 October 2010.

440. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the revocation does show that, under the new
environmental and touristic policies of the Fidesz Government applicable to the Lake
Velence region, Sukor6 was no longer acceptable as a site for the Project. Minister
Fellegi and Dr. R6za Nagy both confirmed in their witness statements that, besides the
new Government’s position that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void, the im-

plementation of the Project at Sukoré would be “inconsistent”

99525

or “in contradiction
with the Government’s new environmental and touristic policies. Thus, the Tribu-
nal considers it established that the Government had a public policy reason for not

wanting the Project to be implemented at Sukoré.
f) The Tribunal’s Conclusion

441.

In summary, Claimant has not established that the Fidesz Government adopted a gen-
eral policy against the realization of the Project in Hungary. However, Claimant has
submitted conclusive evidence that the Fidesz Government was opposed to the imple-
mentation of the Project at Sukoré based on its new environmental and touristic poli-
cies. In the Tribunal’s view, after the Project Sponsors had certified Sukor6 as the Pro-
ject site, these new environmental and touristic policies constituted a public policy rea-
son behind the termination of the Concession Contract because, as clearly stated in the
— unanimously approved — Proposal for the revocation of Special Project Status, the
new Government had determined that, “based on environmental and touristic consid-

erations, [the Project] shall not be implemented at Sukoré.”*”© This would be sufficient
to conclude that Respondent acted in its sovereign capacity when it terminated the
Concession Contract. In addition, as stated before, the corruption concerns (although
never proven) may also have played a role in the Government’s decision to terminate
the Concession Contract, and if so, would also constitute a public policy reason for the
contractual termination.

Were this the end of the Tribunal’s analysis, this could lead to a finding of expropria-
tion. However, as noted above, the Tribunal must now determine as a further step
whether Respondent — in addition to its public policy reason — also had contractual
grounds for terminating the Concession Contract and, if that is the case, whether it was
legitimate for Respondent to exercise its right to terminate on those grounds.

Did Respondent Have Contractual Grounds for Terminating the Concession Con-
tract?

Summary of Claimant’s Position

Respondent’s Purported Termination Grounds Do Not Justify the Termination of
the Concession Contract

Claimant submits that the Termination Letter was based on improper reasons.

SDI Europe Had the Legitimate Right of Possession to and the Right to Build on
the Sukor6 Site

Claimant first refers to Respondent’s allegation that KC Bidding breached Clause 9.3
of the Concession Contract because it failed to certify that SDI Europe had the “Jegiti-
mate right of possession” and the “right of encroachment” with regard to the Sukoré
Site. Clause 9.3 provides, in relevant part:

“Starting from January 1, 2011 up to the expiry of the concession pe-
riod, the Concession Company shall continuously hold the legitimate
right to possession of the real properties for establishment of the Ca-
sino, [...] and the right to encroachment of the necessary superstruc-
tures within the settlement where the activity subject to concession is
exercised.”

°° Exhibit R-94.
*7 Exhibit C-1.

445. Claimant submits that the Concession Company had “/awful possession” and the “right

99528 = A
°°8 in accordance with

to build,” which corresponds to the “right to encroachment,

Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.°”? Claimant argues that, under Hungarian law,

the owner of land is entitled to transfer possession of that land to another person and,

in so doing, the person to whom possession is given is entitled to use that land. Fur-
ther, as established by Hungarian court practice, the “right to build” is encompassed
within the right to use the land.>?

446. In this case, Claimant notes that Respondent transferred possession of the Sukor6 Site
to Mr. Blum through the Land Swap Agreement and thereby accepted that the land
would be used by the new possessor, Mr. Blum, even prior to the registration of his
ownership in the Land Registry.**! As a consequence, Claimant is of the view that the
subsequent finding of invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement by the Hungarian courts
has no bearing on Mr. Blum’s “lawful possession” or his “right to build,” as it could
not extinguish Respondent’s “consensual transfer of possession of the lands, which is a
legal transaction distinct from the Land Swap Agreement” under Hungarian law.>

447. Claimant submits that Mr. Blum’s possession was “lawful” as it was based on Re-
spondent’s “unequivocal consent and authorisation,” which is reflected in the Regis-
tration Authorization and the Handover Protocol.°*? Claimant refers to its expert Dr.
Tausz, who stated in his expert opinion that “[i]n the Registration Authorisation, the
Respondent consented to Mr. Blum exercising all the ownership rights over the Sukor6
Real Properties. [...] This included the owner’s consent to build, which [...] is part of
the owner’s rights.”>4 Claimant further refers to Dr. Tausz’s observation that the
Handover Protocol reflected the “mutual, uniform intention of the parties to transfer
possession of the [Sukoré] Properties from the Respondent to Mr. Blum” as well as
Prof. Kisfaludi’s statement that the Handover Protocol represented the “common will

of the parties to carry out such a transfer.”* 35

Claimant submits that, subsequently, nothing prohibited Mr. Blum from transferring
this “lawful possession” to KC Bidding, and then KC Bidding from assigning this right
to the Concession Company.**°

Claimant further contends that Respondent made no effort to take back possession of
the Sukor6 Site or otherwise demonstrate that it did not consider the Sukor6 Site to be
available as a Project site, such as repayment of the sum that Mr. Blum had paid pur-
suant to the Land Swap Agreement.>*”

Claimant Was Not Required to Establish the Concession Company Within the
Administrative Territory of the Project Site as at 1 January 2011

Claimant secondly refers to Respondent’s allegation that KC Bidding had failed to
comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract because, after having established
the Concession Company in Székesfehérvar, KC Bidding was required in accordance
with Clause 7.1.2 to certify a Project Site in Székesfehérvar rather than in Sukor6.
Clause 7.1 of the Concession Contract provides, in relevant part:

“[...] The Concession Company should meet the following require-
ments at the same time of establishing and throughout the concession
period as well.

7.1.2. The headquarters of the Concession Company shall be located
within the territory of the settlement where the activity subject
to concession is exercised.”

Claimant submits that, as Respondent could not terminate the Concession Contract
with immediate effect on the basis of Clause 7.1.2, it “employed a contrived and base-
less interpretation of Clause 9.3 to do so by another route.” Claimant argues that,
despite KC Bidding’s having notified Respondent on 21 December 2010 that it had
acquired lawful possession of the Sukor6 Site, Respondent “somehow” concluded from
the fact that the headquarters of SDI Europe was “formally located” in Székesfehérar
that KC Bidding had chosen Székesfehérvar to be the settlement in which the conces-

sion activity would be exercised.”

Claimant contends that, according to Respondent’s interpretation of the Concession
Contract, KC Bidding would have been required to determine within 90 days of the
signing of the Concession Contract (i.e., the time limit for establishing the Concession
Company) where the concession activity would be exercised. Conversely, it is Claim-
ant’s position that Clauses 7.1 and 4.2 required KC Bidding to locate the seat of the
Concession Company at the place of the concession activity only once those activities
had commenced.™”

In Claimant’s view, Respondent’s internal correspondence and that with KC Bidding
throughout 2010 “reveals its lack of belief in this illogical interpretation of Clauses
7.1.2 and 9.3” because it shows that Respondent did not consider KC Bidding to be
limited to Székesfehérvar after SDI Europe was established there on 21 January
2010."

Claimant further asserts that Respondent, relying on Clause 7.1.2 alone, based the ter-
mination of the Concession Contract on the fact that the Concession Company was lo-
cated in Székesfehérvar rather than in Sukor6. In response to Respondent’s interpreta-
tion of the clause that the Concession Company “had to be located in the actual set-
tlement chosen by KC Bidding from the list in Annex I of the Concession Contract,”
Claimant relies on its expert Dr. Tausz who opined that Respondent’s argument is
based on Clause 7.1.2 “read in isolation, without regard to the Concession Contract as
a whole,” which results in an “absurd” interpretation of the provision.*?

Claimant argues that Clause 5 of the Concession Contract provides that the concession
activity may be exercised within the administrative area of one of the 133 settlements
contained in Annex 1, whereas Clause 9.3 requires the Concession Company to have
“lawful possession” and the “right to build’ for the real properties on 1 January 2011.
As the final location of the concession activities did not have to be determined at the
time that the Concession Company was established, the Concession Contract did not
require the headquarters of the Concession Company to be established at Sukor6 rather
than at Székesfehérvar, which was also one of the 133 potential settlements.** Claim-
ant refers to the statement of its expert Dr. Tausz that it would therefore be “nonsensi-
cal to apply the requirement of Clause 7.1.2 for the time of establishment of the Con-

cession Company, at which point in time the location of the concession activity is not

yet known.

456. Claimant further asserts that Respondent ignores the wording of the preceding Clause
7.1, according to which “the following requirements [should be met by the Concession
Company] at the same time of establishing and throughout the concession period as
weil.” Pursuant to Clause 4.2, the concession period shall start at the date on which the
license for performing the concession activity is granted. Claimant contends that, as
the concession period never started, KC Bidding was not obliged to move the seat of
the Concession Company to the place where the concession activity would be exer-
cised and thus the establishment at Székesfehérvar did not constitute a breach of the
Concession Contract.*

457. In any event, Claimant submits that such a breach would not justify termination of the
Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1. Claimant re-
fers to the opinion of its expert Dr. Tausz that the list in Clause 15.2.1 is exhaustive
and does not include the failure to establish the Concession Company within the terri-
tory of the settlement where the concession activity is to be exercised. Claimant further
argues that the immediate termination of the Concession Contract “for an alleged fail-
ure to comply with a registration requirement, was grossly disproportionate” and re-
fers to Dr. Tausz’s statement that “[i]t would be highly unreasonable to frustrate an
investment of this magnitude due to such an administrative formality, [as] moving the
registered seat of a Hungarian company from one city to another is a very simple,

formal procedure which can be accomplished within a few weeks.” 46

(iii) The Suretyship Provided by Mr. Lauder Complied with the Terms of the Conces-
sion Contract

45

oe

Finally, Claimant refers to Respondent’s allegation that the Suretyship provided by
Mr. Lauder did not comply with the terms of Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract.
Clause 12.1 provides:

“As security for any of its payment obligations arising from this Con-
tract, the Concession Receiver shall ensure from January 1, 2010 for
the full concession period without interruption a bank guarantee, se-
curity deposit or cash surety.”

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

459. In response to Respondent’s assertion that the Suretyship did not comply with the re-
quirements because it was limited in time and in value, Claimant argues that this inter-
pretation contradicts the plain language of the Concession Contract. Claimant submits
that Clause 12.1 offers the concession receiver the choice of three types of acceptable
security; however, Respondent’s interpretation of the term “without interruption” in
Clause 12.1 fails to take into account the terms of Clause 12 as a whole. Claimant re-
fers to the use of the same term in Clause 12.2.2, pursuant to which “[t]he bank guar-
antee shall be provided without interruption, i.e. on an annual basis.”

460. Claimant is of the view that the meaning of the term “without interruption” provided in
Clause 12.2.2 must apply with equal force to all three types of security.°4” Claimant re-
fers to its expert Prof. Kisfaludi who noted in his expert opinion that “[i]t would result
in an insolvable contradiction to interpret section 12.1 of the Concession Contract as
requiring an unlimited guarantee in terms of time and amount, when the next section
on bank guarantee [...] specifies both a time limit and minimum amount.?**

461. Claimant argues that KC Bidding was entitled to change the type of security, provided
that valid security was in place as of 1 January 2011. As Mr. Lauder’s Suretyship only
expired on 31 March 2011, it was still valid at the time of Respondent’s termination of
the Concession Contract.”

462. With regard to Respondent’s argument that the limitation of the amount was an “unac-
ceptable condition of the Surety,” Claimant contends that Respondent again fails to in-
terpret Clause 12.1 in the context of Clause 12 as a whole and refers to Clause 12.2.3,
according to which the amount of the bank guarantee shall equal the concession fee
payable by the Concession Receiver for the given years. According to Claimant, this
provision confirms that Clause 12.1 does not require any of the three types of security
to be unlimited in amount.°°°

463. Finally, Claimant asserts that Respondent, on at least two occasions prior to the termi-
nation, positively assured Claimant of the validity of the Suretyship:*"! On 9 December
2009, Mr. Arvai wrote in his letter to Dr. Bard that “the suretyship is acceptable and
no objections have been raised according to paragraph 12.4 of the concession agree-

ment.” By letter of 5 March 2010, Dr. Oszk6 also confirmed to KB Bidding that
there were “no reservations regarding the implementation of the terms of this [conces-

letters, “it is reasonable to say that the State of Hungary, the creditor, accepted the
Suretyship Declaration” and that the suretyship was thus valid under Hungarian

law.2>4

464.

&

Claimant argues that if even if the Suretyship was “not technically in compliance with
the terms of the Concession Contract,” the two letters constitute either a waiver by Re-
spondent of the exercise of its rights based on a breach of those terms or a modification
of the Concession Contract itself.*° Claimant is of the view that, having accepted the
validity of Mr. Lauder’s Suretyship, Respondent was obliged under Hungarian law to
act in good faith and to cooperate. Claimant refers to the expert opinion of Prof.
Kisfaludi who stated that the obligation to cooperate “required the Respondent to noti-
Sy the other party, KC Bidding Kft., of the breach and to give it sufficient time to rectify
the breach.”*°°

b) Respondent Is Not Entitled to Rely upon Grounds of Termination the Causes of
Which Were its Own Failures

465. Claimant submits that, even if Respondent’s termination of the Concession Contract
were genuinely based on the purported reasons, as a corollary of the principle that nul-
lus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria (no man can take advantage of his
own wrong), the fact that Respondent’s own conduct gave rise to the existence of such
purported reasons means that its reliance upon them cannot be in good faith.°”

466.

a

Claimant refers to the fact that (i) the MNV attacked the valuation of its own valuator
Perfekting in arguing for the invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement; (ii) ITD Hungary
relied on Respondent’s own investigation of the Land Swap Agreement, which arose
exclusively out of the dispute that had arisen between Respondent’s Water Authority
and Construction Authority, to justify its refusal to sign the incentive agreement; and
(iii) Respondent concluded that KC Bidding did not hold “the legitimate right to pos-
session of the real properties of establishment of the Casino [...] and the right to en-

croachment of the necessary superstructures within the settlement where the activity
subject to [the] concession is exercised”*** on the basis that Mr. Blum’s legal title over
the Sukoré Site had not been registered. Claimant’s expert witness Dr. Tausz describes
this situation as having arisen out of the “gross incompetence by the collective State
authorities” in connection with the Land Swap Agreement.>”

Claimant submits that Respondent relied upon “its own multiple failures,”°°

namely
the lack of registration and the failure of the tract formation procedure, to prevent KC
Bidding from satisfying the requirements of the Concession Contract, and asserts that,
as a matter of Hungarian law, this is not permissible under the principle nemo suam

turpitudinem allegans auditur.*°!

Claimant refers to the opinion of its expert Prof. Kisfaludi who opines:

“Taking into consideration that the cause of the failure of the tract
formation was the breach of law by the Respondent’s own construc-
tion authority (as specified by the public prosecutor’s protest), the
Respondent’s challenge to Mr. Blum’s ‘right to build’ was clearly
based upon its own failure. This is not acceptable in civil law rela-
tionships. Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code prohibits using
one’s own culpable acts as a basis for acquiring benefits.°°

Claimant further quotes Prof. Kisfaludi’s statement that Respondent was not entitled to
tely upon grounds for termination the causes of which were its own failures:

“[E]ven if it is assumed that the absence of registration of Mr.
Blum’s ownership concerning the Sukor6 site had been in itself a
good reason for termination of the Concession Contract (which it
was not), the Respondent organs’ own failures in the registration
process deprived the Respondent from using the missing registration
as a basis for termination of the Concession Contract.”

Claimant finally refers to Prof. Kisfaludi’s conclusion that, treating Respondent as a
“single unit, embracing all the organs and organisations which were established and

maintained by the Respondent,” Respondent cannot rely upon its own failures to justi-

fy the termination of the Concession Contract.*™

2. Summary of Respondent’s Position

a) The Concession Contract Was Terminated in Accordance with its Terms and
Hungarian Law

471. Respondent submits that it terminated the Concession Contract with immediate effect
on the basis of three independent grounds, all of which constitute valid grounds for
termination under Hungarian law.°°

(i) SDI Europe Did Not Have the Legitimate Right of Possession of and the Right to
Build on the Sukoré Site

472. Respondent first submits that KC Bidding failed to certify that SDI Europe had the
“legitimate right of possession” and the “right of encroachment” as required under
Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.

473. Respondent submits that Clause 15.2.1.1 provides that failure to secure a Project site in
accordance with Clause 9.3 entitles the State to terminate the Concession Contract with
immediate effect.*°

474. Respondent argues that the sequence of events that preceded KC Bidding’s notification
of the Ministry of National Economy that SDI Europe had allegedly acquired lawful
possession of the Sukoré Site demonstrates that possession of the land was established
at the last minute in order to present the appearance of formal compliance with Clause
9.3 of the Concession Contract. Respondent argues that from October 2009 and
throughout 2010, the Project Sponsors understood that they needed to secure an alter-
native site for the Project and made some effort to do so; however, KC Bidding failed
to secure an alternative location.” In this regard, Respondent refers to the following
events:

- On 20 December 2010, ten days before the deadline to secure a Project site, KC
Bidding and SDI Europe concluded the Assignment Agreement which purported to
transfer to SDI Europe KC Bidding’s rights to the Leased Real Properties as de-

fined in the Lease Agreement and, in particular, the “right of possession and the

building (encroachment) rights.

- On 21 December 2010, KC Bidding and SDI Europe concluded a handover proto-
col, purporting to transfer possession of the Leased Real Properties to the Conces-
sion Company.*

- On 21 December 2010, KC Bidding sought to certify to the Ministry of National
Economy that SDI Europe had acquired lawful possession of, and the right to build
on, the real properties at Sukoré, and that KC Bidding had accordingly complied
with its contractual obligations under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.°”

Respondent refers to the witness statement of Dr. R6za Nagy, in which she explains

that KC Bidding’s letter of 21 December 2010 was reviewed by the Ministry of Na-

tional Economy’s external legal counsel who determined that SDI Europe could not
have acquired legitimate possession of, or the right to build on, the Sukoré Site,
prompting the Ministry’s decision to terminate the Concession Contract.*7!

Respondent relies on the opinion of its expert Prof. Kiraély who explains that the re-

quirement of “legitimate possession” in the context of Clause 9.3 of the Concession

Contract is two-fold: (i) the Concession Contract must be in actual possession of the

Project site, and (ii) this possession must be based on a valid legal title.5”

Respondent
claims that the chain of transfer of possession is fundamentally flawed because the first
link in the chain is missing: Mr. Blum never held (and therefore could never have ef-

fectively transferred) a valid legal title to the Sukoré Site.°”?

Respondent argues that Mr. Blum could not have acquired valid legal title to the Su-
kor6é Site because that legal title derived from the Land Swap Agreement. This Agree-
ment was, as now confirmed by the Curia, null and void ab initio, which, Respondent
submits, means that no rights or obligations could derive from that contract.°”4

Respondent argues that there was no consensual transfer of possession independent of
the Land Swap Agreement. It refers to the expert opinion of Prof. Kirdly that the hand-

ing over recorded in the Handover Protocol “took place on the basis of the Land Swap

Agreement” and further that the Registration Authorization was issued in order to

“carry out the Land Swap Agreement.”>”

479. Respondent further asserts that no consensual transfer of ownership took place, even if
the Land Swap Agreement had been valid, because the Registration Authorization
could not create ownership rights without the actual registration.°”°

480. As regards the “right to encroachment,” Respondent again refers to Prof. Kiraly, who
explained that “this right corresponds to the right to build, which is held exclusively by

the owner of the land, who alone may transfer this right to third parties.”*""

481.

Respondent submits that it is incorrect for Claimant’s expert Dr. Tausz to state that the
rights relating to the Sukor6é Site granted pursuant to Section III.3 of the Land Swap
Agreement include the right to build.”

482. Respondent maintains that Mr. Blum never acquired a right of ownership. His alleged
right to build therefore had to be otherwise transferred by the owner of the land. Fur-
thermore, the Land Swap Agreement and the Handover Protocol did not grant Mr.
Blum any right to build on the Sukoré Sites”

- Section III.3 of the Land Swap Agreement did not transfer any right to build to Mr.
Blum. Section III. 3 of the Land Swap Agreement provides: “Starting from the
date of cession, the Parties shall be entitled to the rights and benefits related to the
property — acquired on the basis of the present agreement — and they shall bear all
burdens as well as the damage and loss risks related to the property.”>*° First, the
acquisition of any “rights related to the property” by Mr. Blum could have oc-
curred only after the registration of his title, which never happened. More im-
portantly, Mr. Blum could not and did not acquire any rights based on an agree-
ment that is, as confirmed by the Curia, null and void.

- In addition, the Handover Protocol did not transfer to Mr. Blum the State’s right to
build. As is plain from the language of the Handover Protocol, it did not purport to

transfer a right to build but merely purported to transfer possession, which means
the right to enjoy the property “as is.”

- In any event, Mr. Blum cannot rely on the Land Swap Agreement to assert any
right to build because the Land Swap Agreement was declared null and void, thus
rendering the Handover Protocol, which was concluded on the basis of the Land
Swap Agreement, also null and void.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent submits that Hungary considered the Land Swap
Agreement to be null and void ab initio and asserts that it communicated such view to
Mr. Blum as early as in November 2009.°*!

In response to Claimant’s submission that the Termination Letter does not refer to the
absolute nullity of the Land Swap Agreement, Respondent submits that the nullity was
one of the reasons underlying Respondent’s position in the Termination Letter and that
Hungarian law does not require that the justification of a termination ground be ex-
pressly stated upon termination, as long as the termination ground exists.>*?
Respondent further contends that, even if the Land Swap Agreement had been valid,
the Registration Authorization in itself could not have created ownership rights in the
absence of actual registration. Respondent submits that this was reflected in the draft-
ing of the Termination Letter by way of reference to Article 97(2) of the Hungarian
Civil Code.**

Respondent concludes that Mr. Blum never acquired the right to build on the Sukoré
Site and therefore, on 1 January 2011, SDI Europe did not have the right to build on
that site as required by Clause 9.3. In Respondent’s view, Claimant was fully aware
that it had not secured the Sukoré Site, as Mr. Langhammer confirmed during the
Hearing that Claimant had asked for an extension in October 2010 because he knew
that Claimant, “come I January 2011,” would not otherwise “have possession of the

site

487. Respondent submits that KC Bidding failed to secure a Project site in Sukor6 for rea-
sons unrelated to Respondent and claims that the Project Sponsors were aware from
the outset of the “likely unavailability” of the Sukoré settlement.**°

488. Respondent also refers to the fact that, during the negotiation of the Concession Con-
tract, the Ministry of Finance agreed with KC Bidding that the Concession Contract
should be amended so as to allow for the Project to be implemented in any one of 133
settlements in Central Transdanubia. The Sukor6 Site was initially the sole Project site,
but both parties agreed that the site could be selected from any location within the 133
settlements listed in the Tender and in Annex | to the Concession Contract. Respond-
ent stresses that the only mention of the Sukoré Site in the Concession Contract is con-
tained in Annex 1. Respondent submits that the evidence shows that the Concession
Contract was signed on the mutual understanding that, due to the uncertainties sur-
rounding the Land Swap Agreement, the Project would “likely not proceed in Su-
kor6.787

489. Respondent concludes that it did not procure the grounds for termination of the Con-
cession Contract. Specifically, it did not interfere with KC Bidding’s search for an al-
ternative settlement. Respondent submits that, for reasons unknown to it, KC Bidding
decided to resort to the Sukoré Site, which KC Bidding knew was not available for the
Project.°**

(ii) KC Bidding Failed to Establish the Concession Company within the Same Ad-
ministrative Territory as the Project Site

490. Secondly, Respondent submits that KC Bidding was contractually bound under Clause
7.1.2 of the Concession Contract to establish the headquarters of the Concession Com-
pany “within the territory of the settlement where the activity subject to concession is
exercised,” such obligation continuing “at the time of establishing and throughout the
concession period as well?

491. Respondent submits that KC Bidding purported to certify legitimate possession of a
Project site in Sukoré even though the Concession Company, SDI Europe, had been
and remained established in Székesfehérvar.>”° Respondent emphasizes that, by locat-

ing its headquarters in Székesfehérvar, the Concession Company had, on the basis of
Clauses 7.1 and 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract, designated Székesfehérvar as the
settlement where the concession activity would be exercised.”! According to Re-
spondent, KC Bidding thus failed to certify legitimate possession of a Project Site lo-
cated within the same territory as the Concession Company (i.e., at Székesfehérvar),
which entitled Respondent to terminate the Concession Contract pursuant to Clause
15.2.1.1

In reference to Claimant’s argument that the seat of the Concession Company could be
located in any of the settlements listed in Annex 1 of the Concession Contract, Re-
spondent maintains that Clause 7.1.2 requires that the Concession Company be located
within the “same territory” as the Project site that KC Bidding had chosen from the list
in Annex 1 of the Concession Contract.°”*

Respondent also refers to Claimant’s argument that Respondent’s interpretation of the
Contract would have meant that KC Bidding was required to determine the location of
the exercise of the activity subject to concession within 90 days of signature of the
Concession Contract. Respondent contends that Claimant’s understanding is wrong in
this regard; KC Bidding could subsequently have chosen to locate the Project in anoth-
er location, which would have required it to change the seat of the Concession Compa-
ny." In Respondent’s view, it was logical to consider that by locating and maintaining
its headquarters in Székesfehérvar, KC Bidding had designated Székesfehérvar as the
Project location.*”°

Respondent submits that KC Bidding’s failure to establish the Concession Company
“within the territory of the settlement where the activity subject to concession is exer-

cised” justified the termination of the Concession Contract.°*°

 

Respondent recognizes that failing to establish the Concession Company within the
same territory as the Project site is a formal ground for termination, and submits that it
was included in the Termination Letter as a “matter of proper and cautious legal prac-

tice.” Respondent further submits that the Concession Company could have transferred
its headquarters to Sukor6, but it failed to do $0.97

(iii) The Suretyship Provided by Mr. Lauder Did Not Comply with the Terms of the
Concession Contract

496. Finally, Respondent submits that KC Bidding was contractually bound under Clause
12.1 of the Concession Contract to provide financial security on an annual basis
throughout the concession period to guarantee any of its payment obligations under the
Concession Contract. Respondent relies on its expert Prof. Kiraly’s confirmation that
any security provided under Clause 12.1 must be “unlimited in its amount, i.e., covers
each and any payment obligation of the Concessionaire that may arise from the Con-
cession Contract during the concession” and “uninterrupted” throughout the conces-
sion period.**

497. Respondent submits that the Suretyship provided by Mr. Lauder on behalf of KC Bid-
ding was limited in time and in value: It was valid until 31 March 2011 and capped at
HUF 936 Million. Respondent submits that it was therefore entitled to terminate the
Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.22.°

498. Respondent observes that Claimant does not explicitly deny that Mr. Lauder’s Surety-
ship did not comply with the requirements under Clause 12.1 of the Concession Con-
tract. Rather, Claimant asserts that “Respondent twice positively assured Claimant of
the validity of Mr. Lauder’s suretyship,” i.e., in the letters of Mr. Arvai and Dr. Oszké
dated 9 December 2009 and 5 March 2010, respectively, and was therefore precluded
from referring to KC Bidding’s violation of Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract as
a ground for termination. Respondent contends that these letters provide no such as-

surance.°°

499. In his letter dated 9 December 2009, Mr. Arvai confirmed that “no objection has been
raised with respect to the identity of the guarantor” and that the suretyship therefore
“meets the requirements under paragraph 12.4 of the Concession Contract.” Re-
spondent argues that Claimant’s translation of this letter is inaccurate: Mr. Arvai did
not confirm that “the suretyship was acceptable”; he simply confirmed that Mr. Lauder

was an acceptable guarantor within the meaning of Clause 12.4 of the Concession
Contract, without commenting on the validity of the Suretyship in view of the re-
quirements of Clause 12.1 concerning the term and the value of the Suretyship.” Re-
spondent submits that the identity of the guarantor is unrelated to the basis for termina-
tion articulated in the Termination Letter (that the Suretyship provided by Mr. Lauder
was limited in time and in value).

Likewise, Respondent submits that Claimant’s translation of Dr. Oszk6’s letter of
5 March 2010 is inaccurate; Dr. Oszk6 confirmed that “[n]o objections have been
raised with regard to the performance of these contractual obligations as yer." Re-
spondent maintains that this letter does not address the compliance of the Suretyship
with the relevant requirements under Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract, but ra-
ther the contractual obligations specifically referred to in Mr. Benkley’s letter, includ-
ing the obligations under Clause 12.4 of the Concession Contract concerning the iden-
tity of the guarantor. Respondent submits that it therefore cannot be understood as a
broad assurance as to the validity of the Suretyship.°™

Respondent submits that for these reasons, the three grounds for termination invoked
in Hungary’s Termination Letter are valid under the terms of the Concession Contract
and Hungarian law and therefore justify the termination of the Concession Contract.°>

Respondent refers to Claimant’s argument that, even if the termination were lawful
under Hungarian law, Hungary failed to give KC Bidding advance notice of its inten-
tion to terminate and provide an opportunity to cure any alleged breaches, or to other-
wise agree to KC Bidding’s request for an extension of the deadline under Clause
9.3,° Respondent submits that nothing in the Concession Contract or under Hungari-
an law imposes on the State the obligation to give the investor advance notice of any
termination.

Respondent Was Not Precluded From Relying on the Fact that Mr. Blum Was
Not Registered as the Owner of the Leased Real Properties

With regard to Claimant’s argument that the nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem al-
legans principle prevents Respondent from relying on the lack of registration as a ter-

mination ground, Respondent submits that Claimant has not considered the conditions
that must be fulfilled in order for the nemo auditur principle to apply to the current
case, namely that a party has to rely on its own culpable act with the aim of obtaining
advantages.°”

Respondent refers to the opinion of its expert Prof. Varga who explains that, under
Hungarian law, the crucial element to be determined is whether the act committed
qualifies as a “culpable act”:

“At the heart of the nemo auditor principle, however, lies the notion
of a culpable act, including one’s omissions, breaches of contract,
late performance, criminal acts etc. All these actions have in com-
mon that they do not meet the requirement established in the first
sentence of Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code that is they
cannot be idered reasonable or to be as it can be expected under
the given circumstances.”

Respondent cites Prof. Varga’s statement that “Respondent is not precluded from rely-
ing on the fact that Mr. Blum did not meet the requirement to have legitimate posses-
sion of, and the right to build on the Sukoré plots,” notably because Respondent’s con-
duct in the tract formation process does not qualify as culpable conduct within the
meaning of Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code.°” Respondent refers to Prof.
Varga’s reasoning in this regard:

“According to established case-law developed in connection with
damages claims initiated against public authorities, only a flagrantly

flawed interpretation _and application of the laws in force can

amount to the qualification of a culpable act.”°"

Respondent concludes that the tract formation process “involved highly complicated
matters of Hungarian land law”; therefore, Respondent’s conduct cannot be qualified
as culpable, which renders the nemo auditur principle inapplicable.°!!

Respondent submits that, in any event, the need for the tract formation procedure de-
tived from the Land Swap Agreement and as the Curia confirmed that the Land Swap

cedure is moot.°!

The Tribunal’s Analysis
Preliminary Observations

The Tribunal makes the following preliminary observations: First, a lawsuit is pending
before the Hungarian courts regarding the legality of Respondent’s termination of the
Concession Contract.°'? To the Tribunal’s knowledge, no decision has yet been ren-
dered. Second, the validity of the Land Swap Agreement was similarly the subject of
court proceedings in Hungary, which resulted in a final decision of the Curia, rendered
on 13 November 2012, holding that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void.°"
The Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties that, while the decision
of the Curia has res judicata effect as a matter of Hungarian law, it does not have such
effect on the international plane and does not bind this Tribunal.°> Accordingly, the
Tribunal will, in its own right, decide the issues in light of the evidence before it, giv-
ing due consideration to the Curia decision as evidence of Hungarian law.

The Tribunal notes that, in its Reply, Claimant took the view that the “the Curia deci-
sion [...] cannot be viewed as credible.”°'® First, Claimant submitted that one of the
five judges who sat on the panel during the hearing on 13 November 2012 had only
been appointed to the case the previous day and therefore had not had an opportunity
to examine the file.°!” Second, in Claimant’s view, the Curia based its decision on rea-
sons that “had never been addressed by the parties throughout the life of the proceed-
ing, [and] Mr. Blum was accorded no opportunity to submit his views or submissions
on them.” According to Claimant, the Curia’s decision therefore “‘violate[d] basic
norms of due process and equality of arms at international law.”°"* In its Post-Hearing
Brief, Claimant maintains its position that the Curia determined the invalidity of the
Land Swap Agreement “on the basis of entirely different reasons,”°? but Claimant no
longer refers to the replacement judge; it also no longer draws the conclusion that the

Curia’s decision is thus flawed. The Tribunal notes that none of these issues were
raised by Claimant during the Hearing. In the written pleadings, they have never been
a primary argument or focus of Claimant’s contentions. In fact, the Tribunal cannot
address these issues in any detail because they received only conclusory treatment and
scant attention from the Parties. In any event, they have not been adequately evidenced
to credit them. The Tribunal also notes that the main basis for the Curia’s decision,
ie., that the development of the M4 motorway required the acquisition of only a small
part of the land that was swapped for the Sukoré land, had already been raised as an
argument in the first instance, as evidenced by the discussion of this issue in the deci-

sion of the Fejér County Court.©° Under these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot find
any procedural unfairness in the conduct of the legal proceedings before the Hungarian

courts.
The Termination Grounds Invoked by Respondent

In its Termination Letter, Respondent states that it terminated the Concession Contract
with immediate effect pursuant to the provisions of Clause 15.2.1, and specifically
based on Clauses 15.2.1.1 and 15.2.1.22. Respondent listed three termination grounds.

First, Respondent stated that, pursuant to Clause 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract, the
headquarters of the Concession Company was required to be located where the conces-
sion activity would be exercised. As SDI Europe had its seat in Székesfehérvar at the
time that the contractual deadline for acquiring both the legitimate right to possession
and the right to build expired, Claimant would have needed to secure a Project site at
Székesfehérvar, not at Sukor6, in order to comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession
Contract.

Second, Respondent stated that, even if Claimant had designated Sukoré as the loca-
tion for the concession activity to be exercised, Clause 9.3 was not complied with be-
cause Claimant had not acquired the legitimate right to possession of, and the right to
build on, the Leased Real Properties. Respondent based that conclusion on the fact
that, according to the deeds of ownership, the owner of the Sukoré Site was the Hun-
garian State and not Mr. Blum; accordingly, Mr. Blum could not have entered into a
valid agreement to share ownership with KC Bidding and, in turn, KC Bidding could
not have concluded a valid agreement capable of transferring legitimate ownership and
building rights with regard to the Leased Real Properties to SDI Europe.

Award Page -133-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

514. Third, Respondent based the termination of the Concession Contract on the ground
that the Suretyship provided by Mr. Lauder did not comply with Clause 12.1 of the
Concession Contract because it was not sufficient in time and value.

515. During the proceedings it became clear to the Tribunal that the second ground consti-
tutes Respondent’s main ground for terminating the Concession Contract, whereas the
other two grounds may be considered additional, more formalistic grounds.°! The Tri-
bunal will first address these two additional grounds before turning to its analysis of
the main termination ground.

(i) Respondent’s First Termination Ground: SDI Europe Did Not Have Legitimate
Possession of, and the Right to Build on, a Site in Székesfehérvar

516. Respondent reasoned in its Termination Letter that, as the Concession Company had
been established in Székesfehérvar, Claimant must have designated Székesfehérvar as
the settlement where the concession activity was to be exercised. As Claimant ulti-
mately, in its letter of 21 December 2010, designated a location as the Project site that
was not based in Székesfehérvar, Respondent submits that Claimant failed to comply
with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. The Tribunal notes that Respondent did
not argue in the Termination Letter that Claimant failed to establish the Concession
Company within the same territory as the designated Project site, i.e., at Sukor6, which
would have qualified as a breach of Clause 7.1.2 only, but rather that Claimant, by lo-
cating the headquarters of SDI Europe at Székesfehérvar, designated Székesfehérvar as
the location of the Project site and therefore did not comply with Clauses 9.3 and 7.1.2,
since it did not acquire a site in Székesfehérvar.

517. While recognizing that the headquarters of SDI Europe was indeed located at
Székesfehérvar and not at Sukoré both when the deadline set out in Clause 9.3 expired
on | January 2011 and when the Concession Contract was terminated on 10 January
2011, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent’s reasoning in its Termination Let-
ter that this necessarily leads to the conclusion that Claimant had designated

©" As regards the first termination ground, Respondent concedes in its Reply that Hungary terminated the Con-

cession Contract based on the “admittedly formal” ground that Claimant had not certified the legitimate right of
possession and the right to build in Székesfehérvar. Reply, {[ 237. During its Opening Statement at the Hearing,
Respondent also refers to this termination ground as “a formal matter.” Transcript, p. 338, line 18. In its Clos-
ing Statement, Respondent calls it a “technical ground,” but at the same time emphasizes that it is “a very seri-
ous and legally accurate ground for termination of the Concession Contract.” Transcript, p. 2964, lines 5-11.
In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent again refers to this termination ground as a “formal ground [...] which
was included in the Termination Letter as a matter of proper and cautious legal practice.” Respondent's Post-
Hearing Brief, { 229.

Székesfehérvar as the location for its Project. On the contrary, Claimant, in its letter to
Respondent of 21 December 2010, clearly stated that the Leased Real Properties at Su-
kor6é were to be the location for the “establishment of the Casino and for exercising of
the activity defined therein.”°” The Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimant did not
breach Clause 9.3 in connection with Clause 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract by es-
tablishing the Concession Company at Székesfehérvar and then certifying a Project site
that was not located at Székesfehérvar.

There nevertheless remains the fact that SDI Europe did not have its headquarters
within the same territory as the designated Project site, i.e., at Sukoré. The Tribunal
does not consider it necessary to analyze whether this qualifies as a breach of Clause
7.1.2 of the Concession Contract because, in the Tribunal’s view, even if that were the
case, this breach would not constitute a ground for terminating the Concession Con-
tract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1. The failure to establish the Con-
cession Company within the same territory as the certified Project site does not qualify
as a breach of Clause 9.3 in conjunction with Clause 7.1.2, but as a breach of Clause
7.1.2 only. However, such breach is not included within the grounds for termination
listed in Clause 15.2.1, which has been invoked by Respondent in its Termination Let-
ter. Thus, the Contract itself does not provide for termination on this basis.

In addition, Respondent does not contest that Claimant would have been able to
change the headquarters of the Concession Company to Sukoré easily and within a rel-
atively short period of time. Although Respondent may not have been expressly
obliged to give Claimant the opportunity to remedy any contractual breach before ex-
ercising its termination right, the Tribunal is of the view that it was unreasonable for
Respondent to terminate the Concession Contract relating to such a major Project
without notice and an opportunity to remedy the breach, for what is — in the Tribunal’s

view and as acknowledged by Respondent** — an administrative formality. The Tribu-
nal therefore finds that the fact that the Concession Company did not have its seat in

Sukor6 did not justify, in itself, the immediate termination of the Concession Contract.

Respondent’s Third Termination Ground: Mr. Lauder’s Suretyship Was Limited
in Time and Value

With regard to the Suretyship that Mr. Lauder provided to Respondent, the Tribunal
notes that the Suretyship is dated 12 November 2009, which means that Respondent

was aware of its content for more than a year before it terminated the Concession Con-
tract. The record does not show that, during this time period, Respondent ever voiced
any objections regarding the limited time or value of the Suretyship vis-a-vis the Pro-
ject Sponsors.

Respondent replied to Claimant’s submission of the form of the Suretyship on two
occasions, once by letter from Mr. Arvai dated 9 December 2009 and again by letter
from Dr. Oszk6 dated 5 March 2010. The Parties have submitted different English
translations of these letters. With regard to Mr. Arvai’s letter, Claimant’s translation
reads in its relevant part as follows:

“[T]he suretyship is acceptable and no objections have been raised
according to paragraph 12.4 of the concession agreement.”

Respondent’s translation, on the other hand, reads:

“[T]he suretyship meets the requirements under paragraph 12.4 of
the concession agreement [...], no objection has been raised with re-
spect to the identity of the guarantor.””~

Whereas, in the wording of Respondent’s translation, Mr. Arvai’s assurance appears to
be limited to the acceptance of Mr. Lauder as the person providing the Suretyship,
Claimant’s translation contains no such limitation, but rather indicates a broad assur-
ance that the Suretyship was accepted by the Hungarian State without reservation.

Dr. Oszk6’s letter of 5 March 2010 was written in response to Mr. Benkley’s letter
dated 25 January 2010, in which Mr. Benkley stated that KC Bidding had performed
all of its obligations stipulated under the Concession Contract including, inter alia, the
submission of the Suretyship. He requested that the Minister confirm the performance
of the obligations. According to Claimant’s translation of the letter, Dr. Oszk6 replied:

“There are no reservations regarding the implementation of the
terms of this agreement.”°°

Respondent’s translation of the same part reads:

“No objections have been raised with regard to the performance of
these contractual obligations as yer."

526.

Even though the wording of Respondent’s translation might suggest that Dr. Oszk6 re-
served the right to object to Claimant’s performance in the future (“no objections [...]
as yet’), Respondent has not provided any evidence that any objections were ever
raised in relation to the Suretyship prior to the Termination Letter.

The Tribunal therefore is not required to decide which one of the translations it consid-
ers to be more accurate. Both translations of Mr. Arvai’s letter of 9 December 2009
show that Respondent was aware of the content of the Suretyship before it was to be-
come effective on 1 January 2010 and did not raise any objections to the limitations in
time and value set out in the Suretyship. Further, even if Respondent’s translation of
Dr. Oszk6’s letter of 5 March 2010 were the correct version, the Tribunal is of the
view that Respondent would have been under an obligation to inform Claimant, prior
to the termination of the Concession Contract, that it had changed its position and no
longer considered the Suretyship to be in compliance with Clause 12.1 of the Conces-
sion Contract. Nothing in the record indicates that Respondent ever did so.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the purported non-compliance of the Suretyship
with the provisions of Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract did not justify, in itself,
the immediate termination of the Concession Contract pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.22.

Respondent’s Second Termination Ground: SDI Europe Did Not Have Legitimate
Possession of, and the Right to Build on, the Leased Real Properties at Sukoré

As stated above, the Tribunal considers that Respondent’s main ground for terminating
the Concession Contract was Claimant’s purported failure to comply with Clause 9.3
by not acquiring legitimate possession of, and the right to build on, the Leased Real
Properties, which Claimant had designated as the Project site on 21 December 2010.

The relevant part of the Termination Letter reads as follows:
“The Hungarian State hereby terminates the Concession Contract as
of today’s date effective immediately pursuant to the provisions of

Clause 15.2.1 and based on Clauses 15.2.1.1 and 15.2.1.22 of the
Concession Contract as independent grounds for termination.

sion activity, the documents enclosed by the Concession Receiver did
not meet the requirements set out in the contract. Based on the at-
tached title deeds (Appendix 2), it can be established that on 20 De-
cember 2010 — as well as currently — the owner of the properties reg-
istered in the outskirts of Sukor6 under topographical lot numbers
022/7, 022/8, 022/9 and 022/10 was, and still is, the Hungarian State
and not Joav Blum.

According to Section 97(2) of the Civil Code, the owner of the rele-
vant land is the sole person who may enter into a valid agreement
pertaining to share ownership — granting the ownership of the super-
structures to a person different from the owner of the land — thus the
null and void contract between KC Bidding Kft. and SDI Europe Kft.
is not suitable for supporting the lawful possession and the "right to
encroach" of the Concession Company with regard to the Sukor6 re-
al properties.”°%

527. The Tribunal notes that Respondent did not expressly mention the nullity of the Land

Swap Agreement as the basis for the termination in its letter. However, it is clear that

Respondent implicitly relied on this basis by reference both to Clause 9.3 of the Con-

cession Contract and to the nullity of the Assignment Agreement between KC Bidding

and SDI Europe, which could only derive from the nullity of the Land Swap Agree-

ment.

528. The Tribunal further notes that, even though the Land Swap Agreement had not been

declared null and void by the Curia at the time of termination, the Curia later decided

8 English translation submitted by Respondent as Exhibit R-111. The translation submitted by Claimant as
Exhibit C-202 differs in its wording, but not in substance. The same part reads:

“The Hungarian State hereby terminates the Concession Contract as of today’s date
effective immediately pursuant to the provisions of Item 15.2.1 and based on Items
15.2.1.1 and 15.2.1.22 of the Concession Contract as independent grounds for ter-
mination.

We hereby inform you that even in the event that the Concession Receiver had speci-
fied Sukoré instead of Székesfehérvar as the location for practicing the relevant ac-
tivity, the documents enclosed by the Concession Receiver would not be considered
as proper fulfillment of the contract. As it can be established from the enclosed deed
of ownership (Annex 2), the owner of the real properties under Lot Numbers 022/7,
022/8, 022/9 and 022/10 at the outskirts of Sukoré as of December 20, 2010 — and
even at present — is the Hungarian State and not Mr. Yoav Blum.

The owner of the relevant land is the sole person who may enter into a valid agree-
ment p i to share ‘ship — granting the ‘ship of the built s

to a person different from the owner of the land — pursuant to Article 97(2) of the
Civil Code, thus the null and void contract between KC Bidding Ltd. and SDI Eu-
rope Ltd. is not suitable for supporting the legitimate ownership and "building
rights" of the Concession Company with regard to the Sukoré real properties.”

that it was null and void, meaning that, according to the Curia’s findings, the Land
Swap Agreement was already a nullity when Respondent terminated the Concession
Contract.

529. Before considering the reasoning of the Curia’s decision, the Tribunal will review the
actual status of the real properties in Sukoré as of the date for compliance with Clause
9.3 of the Concession Contract, i.e., 1 January 2011.

- On 30 July 2008, Mr. Blum and the MNV concluded the Land Swap Agreement,
relating to the Sukor6 Site. As noted above, the Land Swap Agreement was later
declared null and void by the Curia in its decision of 13 November 2012.

- On 12 December 2008, the MNV issued the Registration Authorization, which
provided the MNV’s consent to the registration of Mr. Blum’s ownership rights
over the 20 properties at Sukoré that were to be swapped pursuant to the Land
Swap Agreement.

- On 12 February 2009, the MNV and Mr. Blum signed the Handover Protocol, in
which the MNV transferred to Mr. Blum possession of the 16 properties that were
not affected by the tract formation procedure, among them the four properties serv-
ing as the location for the Project (the Leased Real Properties).

- On 8 May 2009, Mr. Blum and KC Bidding entered into the Lease Agreement,
which granted KC Bidding a 24-year lease over the four Leased Real Properties on
which KC Bidding planned to realize the Project.

- On 13 May 2009, the MNV issued a declaration confirming that Mr. Blum had
paid the value difference between the exchanged properties and fulfilled his other
obligations arising out of the Land Swap Agreement, and that the properties not af-
fected by the tract formation procedure had been transferred to the possession of
Mr. Blum.

- On 12 October 2009, Mr. Blum transferred possession of the four Leased Real
Properties to KC Bidding.

- On 20 December 2010, KC Bidding and the Concession Company, SDI Europe,
entered into the Assignment Agreement, by which KC Bidding assigned posses-
sion and the right to build on the Leased Real Properties to SDI Europe, the Con-
cession Company.

531.

532.

533.

- On 21 December 2010, KC Bidding and SDI Europe signed a handover protocol,
by which KC Bidding transferred possession of the Leased Real Properties to SDI
Europe.

The Tribunal concludes from the foregoing that Mr. Blum acquired possession of the
16 Sukoré properties that were not affected by the tract formation procedure on 12
February 2009 and, with regard to the four Leased Real Properties, transferred such
possession to KC Bidding and ultimately SDI Europe, respectively, on 12 October
2009 and 21 December 2010. Consequently, while the Concession Company thus ac-
quired physical possession of the Leased Real Properties, the question that remains to
be answered is whether this possession was “legitimate” and whether it encompassed
the “right to encroachment,” as required under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.

The Tribunal notes that both Claimant’s and Respondent’s experts congruently stated
that “/egitimate” possession requires that such possession is “based on a valid legal ti-

tle”;°” the necessity of a valid legal title can thus be considered as common ground be-

tween the Parties.°°

In the Termination Letter, Respondent relied on the undisputed fact that Hungary, and
not Mr. Blum, was the registered owner of the Sukor6é Site and concluded therefrom
that Mr. Blum was therefore not in a position to transfer any rights regarding the
Leased Real Properties to KC Bidding or SDI Europe. However, the fact that Mr.
Blum was never registered as the owner, is not dispositive of the question whether he
could transfer “/egitimate” possession to KC Bidding because even Respondent’s legal
experts stated in the course of these proceedings that there are other forms of legal ti-
tles for possession. In particular, Prof. Varga acknowledges that “a sale and purchase
contract can [...] serve as a proper legal title for the possession of the thing to be
transferred, if it is existent, valid and effective.”

While the Registration Authorization and the Handover Protocol clearly reflect the
Parties’ intention consensually to transfer possession of the properties to Mr. Blum,
they cannot serve as legal title, as neither of them constitutes a contract in itself. The
Registration Authorization only contains the MNV’s unilateral declaration that Mr.
Blum, having fulfilled his payment obligation, may be registered in the Land Registry,
and the Handover Protocol only records the transfer of possession.

534. The only contract that may potentially serve as a legal title giving rise to a legitimate

tight of possession is the Land Swap Agreement. As stated above, the Curia, in its de-

cision of 13 November 2012, which is final under Hungarian law, declared the Land

Swap Agreement null and void. The decision reads in its relevant part:°

632

“Therefore, when examining whether the legal condition is satisfied,
it cannot be ignored what proportion of the property is actually
needed to implement the construction, and what avenues are open for
the Plaintiff to obtain them.

In this case, out of the approximately 182.89 hectare territory of the
three properties offered by the Respondent, the road construction af-
fected a negligible portion, approximately 10.31 hectare, which is 5-
6% of the entire territory. The value of the territory necessary for the
construction, even if calculated at the — unacceptable — price estab-
lished in the Land Swap Agreement, is only around HUF 45,000,000
out of the total value of HUF 1,084,010,100. Therefore, even based
on the Land Swap Agreement, more than HUF 1,000,000,000 worth
of property is transferred beyond the area necessary for the infra-
structure development, which is severely and indefensibly dispropor-
tionate. When considering the properties’ real market value based on
the expert opinion, then this difference significantly exceeds HUF
1,500,000,000. It is unreasonable that the Plaintiff swaps 1/3 of the
Lake Velence’s North shore, one of the country’s most outstanding
vacational and natural area, for a much less valuable and not par-
ticularly well-situated territory, or rather for the necessary fraction
of it. There was no reason either, why the Hungarian State needed to
obtain several hectares of orchard and an out of use premises, in-
cluding a shed and a water tower, for the purposes of a road con-
struction.

NIF Zrt. — as it had informed the Plaintiff's representative prior to
the conclusion of the agreement — could have obtained the area nec-
essary for the construction by offering a price of HUF 300-400/m2,
or, in case of any obstacles, it could have expropriated it. According
to Section 6 (3) and (4) of Act CXXIII of 2007 on Expropriation, it
would not have been necessary to appropriate the properties in their
entirety, but it is also a fact that — as the appellate court correctly es-
tablished — with respect to the arable lands, the Plaintiff could also
have exercised its preemption right for a fraction of the purchase
price indicated in the agreement. Consequently, the possibility was
open for the Plaintiff to lawfully obtain the portion of the territory
which was in fact necessary for the construction; however, the con-

clusion of a land swap at this scale, with this content, for this alleged
purpose, exceeds the limits of acceptability. On this basis, it can be
established that the condition set forth in Section 13 (4) of the Na-
tional Land Fund Act was not satisfied, the swap was neither neces-
sary nor expedient or reasonable for the purposes of the linear infra-
structure development, therefore the Land Swap Agreement was un-
lawful. Due to the unlawfulness of the Land Swap Agreement, it is
null and void in accordance with Section 200 (2) of the Civil Code.
Had the Land Swap Agreement been accepted as lawful, the statutory
provision would fail to fulfill its social function of protecting state
property, which also serves the interests of public and other inves-
tors, since it would make it possible, through the insertion of a swap
element, which is irrelevant compared to the entire value of the
agreement, to avoid public tendering or auction, which are assuring
the guarantees of the rule of law.

The fact alone that one of the parties — or in this case the previous
representative of the Plaintiff — insists that the land swap was aimed
at serving a public interest, does not make the issue indisputable. The
National Asset Management Council does not create law; that body,
as well as the parties of this lawsuit, is bound by the law; therefore
the lawfulness of the contract concluded by them or approved by the
body’s decision is open to judicial review.

It is an erroneous position that an unlawful contract may only be
deemed null and void if the law itself ties this legal consequence to
the breach of law. This interpretation would mean that breaching
mandatory provisions of the law would remain without legal conse-
quence. Section 200 (2) of the Civil Code is a general rule, which al-
lows for the establishment of the invalidity of a contract even if it is
in conflict with a provision regulating civil legal relationship, which
fundamentally affects the procedure in connection with the creation
of the legal relationship, the rights of representation, the contents of
the contractor other significant circumstances, but does not specifi-
cally attach this legal consequence to the breach (BH2012.220).

The Respondent’s argument, according to which violating the rules
of tendering may indeed result in the nullity of the contract only if the
law specifically prescribes this legal consequence, is correct. How-
ever, in this case the conflict with the law was constituted by the lack
of tendering or auction, whereas, according to the law, the transfer
of the ownership of properties could not have occurred without them.

Since the unlawfulness of the Land Swap Agreement could be deter-
mined, the Curia did not examine the merits of other reasons of inva-
lidity and, in based on Section 275 (3) of the Code on Civil Proce-
dure, with the modified reasons explained herein, upheld the judg-
ment in effect.”

537.

The Tribunal has carefully considered the Curia’s reasoning and has come to the con-

clusion that, contrary to Claimant’s view,°*

it is “credible” and persuasive under the
circumstances. In particular, the Tribunal refers to the Curia’s observation that the de-
velopment of the M4 motorway affected only a “negligible portion,” i.e., 5-6%, of the
Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land, which Mr. Blum offered in exchange for the Su-
kor6 Site. There is no basis in the record to disagree with the Curia when it concluded
that it was not necessary to “appropriate” the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land in
their entirety in order to build the motorway. Therefore, the land swap was not neces-
sary for the State, and the public interest requirement in Section 13(4) of the National
Land Fund Act was not satisfied. As a consequence, the Curia held that the Land Swap
Agreement was null and void in accordance with Section 200(2) of the Hungarian Civ-
il Code. The Tribunal does not perceive any reason to disagree with the Curia’s find-
ings and will therefore treat the Land Swap Agreement as null and void in line with the
Curia’s decision.

The Parties’ experts have divergent views as to the impact of the nullity of the Land
Swap Agreement on the right of possession. According to Claimant’s expert Dr.
Tausz:

“Mr. Yoav Blum could consider the Land Swap Agreement valid irre-
spective of the Hungarian State’s view to the contrary. The Hungari-
an State’s declaration, proclaimed in the statement of claim filed
with the Fejér County Court on 19 November 2009 that the Land
Swap Agreement is invalid only created a pending situation concern-
ing the validity of the Land Swap Agreement. Consequently, until the
standpoint of the Hungarian State was substantiated by a final and
binding court decision, Mr. Yoav Blum could not be required to con-
sider the Land Swap Agreement invalid.

Thus, until the issuance of such a final and binding court decision,
Mr. Yoav Blum had the right to claim the performance of the Land
Swap Agreement from the Hungarian State, and could consider the
Sukor6 Real Properties his own.”6*4

In response to this statement, Respondent’s expert Prof. Varga stated that:

“Hungarian law differentiates between two kinds of invalidity: nullity
(in Hungarian:‘sémmisség’) and voidability (in Hungarian:
‘megtamadhatésag’ ). Whereas nullity is absolute and unconditional,

°3 Of Reply, 1350.

Award Page -143-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

538.

539.

voidability is conditional. The reason why nullity is considered un-
conditional is that nullity of a contract occurs by force of the law
(‘ipso iure’), and the establishment of the contract’s nullity does not
require a court proceeding or any other proceeding. Furthermore, as
also stated in Section 234(1) of the Hungarian Civil Code, every per-
son can refer to the fact that the contract is null and void without any
time limits. In contrast to this, the invalidity of a voidable contract is
conditional because — as also stated in Section 235(1) of the Hungar-
ian Civil Code — the contract will only be invalid in case a person
entitled to avoid the contract avoids it within the time set by law. In
this case the contract will become invalid ex tunc that is retrospec-
tively to the time of its conclusion.

Based on the above and as confirmed by both Hungarian court prac-
tice and legal literature, the statements of Mr Patrick Tausz made in
Sections 4.6.1. and 4.6.2. of his Expert Opinion are fundamentally
erroneous. Mr. Tausz states that the action brought by the State of
Hungary with the Fejér County Court claiming invalidity of the Land
Swap Agreement ‘only created a pending situation concerning the va-
lidity of the Land Swap Agreement’ and that ‘until the standpoint of
the Hungarian State was substantiated by a final and binding court
decision, Mr. Yoav Blum could not be required to consider the Land
Swap Agreement invalid’. Mr. Tausz seemingly ignores the very es-
sence of the institution of nullity under Hungarian law, that nullity of
a contract is unconditional, that it occurs by force of law, and that
the establishment of a contract’s nullity does not require a court pro-
ceeding or any other proceeding.”**

The Tribunal finds Prof. Varga’s opinion well-reasoned, in particular as concerns the
distinction under Hungarian private law between the two kinds of invalidity, nullity
and voidability, and the absolute and unconditional character of nullity, which in the
words of Prof. Varga “occurs by force of the law (‘ipso iure’ )” without the requirement
of a court proceeding. The Tribunal considers Prof. Varga’s view convincing and
therefore concludes that, as the Land Swap Agreement was null and void ipso iure in
accordance with Section 200(2) of the Hungarian Civil Code, no legitimate right of
possession within the meaning of Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract could derive
therefrom. The same reasoning applies to the right to build.

Claimant further argues that Respondent was responsible for both the lack of
Mr. Blum’s registration as the owner of the Sukor6é Site and the failure of the tract
formation procedure, and therefore should not be allowed to terminate the Concession

5 Varga I, i] 36-37.

Award Page -144-
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

Contract based on a ground that was brought about by its own failures. Claimant refers
to its expert, Prof. Kisfaludi, who opines that Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code
prohibits Respondent from relying on the lack of registration, which was due to its
own failures, as a basis for the termination of the Concession Contract.*°

540. Respondent does not seriously dispute its responsibility for the failure of the tract for-
mation procedure, but argues that this does not preclude it from relying on the lack of
registration. Respondent refers to its expert, Prof. Varga, who opines that, according to
the Curia’s practice, the Hungarian Civil Code is not applicable to acts of administra-
tive law, such as the issuance of the Tract Formation Permit; therefore, the culpability
of civil law conduct, as required in Section 4(4), cannot be based on the alleged culpa-
bility of the administrative act of the construction authority. Prof. Varga further ar-
gues that, in any event, the construction authority’s conduct would not qualify as cul-
pable conduct within the meaning of Section 4(4). Prof. Varga refers to established
case law, pursuant to which only a “flagrantly flawed interpretation and application of
the laws in force” can amount to culpable conduct.®** In Prof. Varga’s view, the failure
of the construction authority to involve the Water Inspectorate in the tract formation
procedure as a special authority for landscape protection, and the fact that the Town
Clerk exceeded its subject matter jurisdiction in determining the shore line strip of the
real properties, do not amount to such a “flagrantly flawed interpretation and applica-
tion of the laws in force” and therefore do not constitute culpable conduct within the
meaning of Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code.°”

541. Respondent further states that, in any event, the tract formation procedure is irrelevant
because the Land Swap Agreement was null and void and could not create any obliga-
tion for the MNV to conduct the tract formation procedure or to register Mr. Blum as
the owner of the Sukoré Site.

542. Considering that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void, the Tribunal is of the
view that there is no need to decide whether Respondent is precluded from relying on

636 Kisfaludi, (] 64, 71. Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code provides: “Unless this Act prescribes stricter
requirements, it shall be necessary to proceed in civil relations in a manner deemed reasonable under the given
circumstances. No person shall be entitled to refer to his own actionable conduct in order to obtain ad-
vantages. Whosoever has not proceeded in a manner deemed reasonable under the given circumstances shall
be entitled to refer to the other party's actionable conduct.” The Tribunal notes that the English translation
submitted by Claimant as Exhibit AK-28A omits the word “nor” in the last sentence; the correct meaning of
this sentence would be: Whosoever has not proceeded in a manner deemed reasonable under the given circum-
stances shall not be entitled to refer to the other party’s actionable conduct.

failures for which it may be responsible. The alleged mismanagement of the tract for-
mation procedure may well have delayed the formal act of registering Mr. Blum as the
owner of the Sukoré Site and may well have been due to Respondent’s own failures.
However, even if Mr. Blum had in fact been registered as the owner by 1 January
2011, his registration would not have made him the lawful owner of the Sukor6 Site,
because the Land Swap Agreement was null and void. As stated by Respondent’s ex-
pert Prof. Varga, “the Hungarian system of transfer of ownership qualifies as a s

 

which requires a valid title for the transfer and in addition to the valid legal title, an
act of transfer of the thing.” Therefore, even if the failure of the tract formation pro-
cedure was indeed due to Respondent’s acts or omissions, ultimately this would not
change the Tribunal’s decision.

c) The Tribunal’s Conclusion

543. In conclusion, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant has not established that SDI
Europe had the legitimate right to possession of, and the right to build on, the Leased
Real Properties as of 1 January 2011. Thus, Claimant failed to perform a material obli-
gation of the Concession Contract and, in fact, the very first step in realizing the Pro-
ject. As a consequence, the Tribunal considers that, in addition to the public policy rea-
son set out above, Respondent also had a contractual ground for terminating the Con-
cession Contract under Clause 9.3 with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1.

G. Did Respondent Abuse its Contractual Termination Right in Order to Avoid Lia-
bility to Compensate?

544. Having reached the conclusion that Respondent had both a public policy reason and a
contractual reason for terminating the Concession Contract, the remaining question is
whether Respondent exercised its contractual termination right legitimately or whether,
in the circumstances, it was an abuse intended to avoid the liability to compensate, thus
amounting to a “fictitious” or “malicious” exercise of its contractual rights. If the latter
were proven, the termination of the Concession Contract could amount to an expro-
priation. The burden of proof obviously lies with Claimant on this issue.

545. The Tribunal will therefore examine whether Respondent acted contrary to good faith
in terminating the Concession Contract rather than granting Claimant’s request for an

extension of that deadline in view of the “ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Sukoré

land.”

Summary of Claimant’s Position
Respondent Refused to Extend the Contractual Deadline

Claimant submits that Respondent refused to extend the contractual deadline to certify
a site for the Project beyond January 2011 even after it became clear that the courts
would not render a decision in the Land Swap Litigation until much later.°?

Claimant further states that it was Claimant’s understanding throughout that, until the
resolution of the Land Swap Litigation, the Land Swap Agreement remained valid and
the Sukor6 Site remained the preferred site for the Project. Claimant contends that, on
5 October 2009, a few days before the signing of the Concession Contract, Respond-
ent’s Minister of Finance, Dr. Oszk6, assured Claimant that the Land Swap Agreement
would be submitted to the Hungarian courts for validation in order to ensure that
MNV’s valuations of the land concerned were correct.“* Claimant submits that both
Mr. Blum and Mr. Langhammer left the meeting of 5 October 2009 feeling positive in
anticipation that a court would either approve the value or arrive at an adjusted value,
which Mr. Blum would then pay.°* According to Claimant, during his meetings with
Mr. Blum on 10 September and with Messrs. Blum and Langhammer on 5 October
2009, Dr. Oszk6 neither raised the possibility of starting the acquisition of the Sukoré
land “afresh” nor did he recommend terminating the Land Swap Agreement.

Claimant submits that Respondent’s witnesses indicated that they envisaged no partic-
ular timeframe for resolution of this issue by the Hungarian courts. Claimant refers to
Dr. Oszk6’s oral testimony in which he admitted that he had no comprehension of how
long the Land Swap Litigation would take.™®

After Respondent initiated the Land Swap Litigation, the Project Sponsors began a
diligent search for alternative sites. However, the Sukoré Site remained the preferred
site for the Project notwithstanding the search for possible alternatives. According to
Claimant, Respondent was aware that Claimant was investigating new sites because

Claimant conveyed this to Respondent in a letter from Mr. Gaye to Dr. Oszk6 dated
26 February 2010 and in another letter which Mr. Gaye personally handed over in a
meeting with Mr. Tamas Kocsis of the Ministry of National Development on 16 Sep-
tember 2010.”

Claimant submits that, on 10 December 2010, KC Bidding requested that Respondent
extend the time available “by an additional 12 months from the date when the so called
Sukor6 site court case will be finished with a legally binding decision.”“* Claimant
considers that this was a reasonable request given the Project Sponsors’ understanding
that the availability of the Sukoré Site was dependent on the outcome of the case.

Claimant submits that Respondent refused each of Claimant’s requests to extend the
time available to it to comply with its obligations under the Concession Contract, while
it did grant a number of modifications to both the Dream Island concession contract
and the EuroVegas casino concession contract. Claimant submits that this clearly evi-
dences discriminatory treatment vis-a-vis Claimant.°°

Claimant further contends that Respondent’s termination of the Concession Contract
was “a disproportionate response to what were relatively minor purported contractual
breaches.”®! As to the legitimate possession requirement, Claimant states that Re-
spondent could have granted KC Bidding an extension of time “to remedy its purport-
ed non-compliance” with this requirement. Claimant asserts that such an approach
would have been particularly proportionate in view of the “administrative inefficien-
cies” of Respondent’s own organs in the registration procedure and of the multiple in-
vestigations that Respondent launched into its own conduct in relation to the Land
Swap Agreement.°”

In this context, Claimant also relies on the case of Occidental v. Ecuador in which the
tribunal held that “[t]he fact that a contractor agrees that caducidad [i.e., termination]
may be a remedy in certain situations does not mean that the contractor has waived its

right to have such a remedy imposed proportionately.”°

Claimant concludes that the refusal of Respondent’s representatives to meet with
Claimant to discuss the status of the Project, including possible extensions of the con-
tractual deadline that, it submits, were necessary as a result of Respondent’s own con-

duct, constitutes a clear example of Respondent’s lack of good faith.°*

Respondent Prevented Claimant from Securing an Alternative Site

Claimant submits that it started its search for alternative sites, when the Land Swap
Agreement was referred to the Hungarian courts, as a “Plan B” in case the Land Swap
Litigation were not resolved in Claimant’s favor by | January 2011. Claimant refers to
Mr. Gaye’s oral testimony, in which he stated that, after the MNV had initiated court
proceedings to challenge the validity of the Land Swap Agreement, they “knew that
there is a risk that by I January 2011, there will be a judgment against Sukor6 and,
therefore, [they] started to look for alternative site [sic].”°>

Claimant submits that Mr. Gaye, who was primarily responsible for the search, identi-
fied “a few sites in Tatabdnya” and refers to his testimony, which confirmed that they
had made it clear from the beginning that they would need the Government’s support

before being able to purchase the land.°°°

According to Claimant, the owner of the site
at Tatabanya was ready and willing to sell the land to Claimant for the realization of
the Project; a draft purchase contract was prepared and the Project Sponsors entered in-
to negotiations with the owner regarding the purchase price for the land.” In Claim-
ant’s view, however, it was crucial that the newly elected Fidesz Government repeat-
edly failed to provide the Project with its support. Claimant concludes that, given this
“manifest denial of support for the Project,” it decided not to purchase the Tatabanya
land.©°8

Claimant further asserts that Mr. Gaye met with significant hostility in relation to pos-
sible Székesfehérvar sites and quotes Mr. Gaye’s oral testimony that “the municipality
in Székesfehérvar was very hostile to [them].”°° Claimant refers to the fact that the
Székesfehérvar Council issued a decision, by which it reversed its original support for
the operation of a mega-casino at its settlement.°

Claimant submits that, after Dr. Oszk6’s letter of 8 March 2010 in which he stated that
Székesfehérvar remained available as a possible site for the Project despite the
Székesfehérvar Council’s decision to withdraw its consent, Mr. Gaye held a number of
meetings with the owner of the land at Székesfehérvar. According to Claimant, how-
ever, it ascertained in consultation with its Hungarian architect that part of the land was
a protected area and decided not to pursue this site any further.°*!

Claimant also submits that, in November 2009 and January 2010, Mr. Gaye met with
Dr. Klara Horvath, the Mayor of Babolna to discuss whether a site they had identified
at Babolna could be used for the Project. Claimant further asserts that, when the mu-
nicipality announced a tender for the sale of land at Babolna, Dr. Budai publicly at-
tacked Dr. Horvath by accusing her of corruption and the forgery of an official docu-
ment and brought criminal proceedings against her. In light of Dr. Budai’s attack and
the surrounding adverse publicity, Claimant was “compelled” to abandon the possibil-
ity to relocate the Project to Babolna.°

Claimant asserts that it attempted to communicate with Respondent concerning its
search for alternative sites. In Claimant’s view, Dr. Oszk6’s response of 8 March
2010% to Claimant’s letter of 26 February 2010°™ demonstrates Respondent’s aware-
ness that Claimant had commenced the search for alternative sites in light of the pend-
ing Land Swap Litigation. Claimant further submits that Mr. Gaye notified the Minis-
try of National Development of the new Fidesz Government about the search in a letter
dated 16 September 2010,°° which he personally handed to Mr. Koesis.%°

Claimant contends that Respondent continually undermined Claimant’s search for al-
ternative sites.” Claimant refers to Mr. Langhammer’s recollection during the Hear-
ing that “as soon as one of the sites was identified, Dr. Budai made other noises about

1668

that site and to Mr. Fisher’s statement, in relation to the land at Badbolna, that

“Bdbolna is the site that the Government spokesman Budai went in the press and
called that Babolna is like Sukor6. So that site died also for us the minute he said it in

the press.7°

562. Claimant claims that it ultimately nominated the Sukor6 Site as the site of the Project
in compliance with the Concession Contract in the absence of any court decision on
the Land Swap Agreement. In response to Respondent’s assertion that Claimant knew
at the time of the execution of the Concession Contract that the Sukoré Site was no
longer “available” for the Project, Claimant submits that the Concession Contract itself
lists the Sukor6 Site as one of 133 available sites for the Project. Claimant submits that
the Project Sponsors and Dr. Oszk6 therefore agreed at the time of the signing that the
Sukor6 Site remained available unless and until a court decided otherwise.” Claimant
concludes that it was therefore not the case that, at the time of the signing, Claimant
was forced to choose between starting the Land Swap Agreement “afresh” and finding

an alternative site.°”!

2. Summary of Respondent’s Position
a) Respondent Was Not Required to Extend the Contractual Deadline

563. Respondent submits that it was under no obligation to grant the investor an extension
of time to comply with its contractual obligations under the Concession Contract.°”? In
Respondent’s view, it was fully entitled to terminate the Concession Contract with

immediate effect.

564. Respondent considers that the principle of good faith cannot be used to negate a par-
ty’s contractual rights or to amend the contractual terms agreed upon by the parties.”
Moreover, Respondent submits, there was no duty of cooperation beyond the clear
terms of the Concession Contract.°

565. Respondent refers to the drafting history of the Concession Contract and the fact that,
although KC Bidding had repeatedly requested an extension of the deadline under
Clause 9.3, the Ministry of Finance insisted that the deadline it had proposed was rea-
sonable. Respondent submits that KC Bidding was therefore aware of the significance

of the deadline under Clause 9.3 and could not have expected to receive any extension
thereof.°”*

566. Respondent does not contest that Claimant repeatedly requested an extension of the
contractual deadline to secure the Project site under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Con-
tract. However, Respondent submits that Claimant had been given over a year to find a
suitable alternative to the Sukoré Site.°”° Respondent emphasizes that this contractual
deadline to secure a Project site under Clause 9.3 was specifically negotiated by KC
Bidding and the Ministry of Finance to “reflect the absence of a confirmed site at the
time of the signature of the Concession Contract,” and to give the Project Sponsors
sufficient time to secure an alternative Project site.°””

567. Respondent submits that the Project Sponsors were, by early September 2009, fully
aware of the risks relating to the validity of the Land Swap Agreement and of the re-
sulting unavailability of the Sukor6é Site as the Project site. Respondent refers to the
undisputed fact that, on 8 September 2009, the Project Sponsors attempted, during
their discussion with Mr. Arvai, to extend the contractual deadline to secure their Pro-
ject site until 1 January 2014, whereas the initial draft provided for 1 January 2011.
Respondent submits that Claimant was thus fully aware that it might take a few years
before the issue regarding the Land Swap Agreement was finally resolved.°*

568. Respondent further emphasizes that, in light of the uncertainties surrounding the Land
Swap Agreement and the discussions among Mr. Blum, Dr. Bard and Dr. Oszk6, it
was decided that the Sukoré Site would not be the designated Project site in the Con-
cession Contract and KC Bidding was instead given a choice among the 133 original
settlements listed in the Tender.°” According to Respondent, this change in the Con-
cession Contract necessarily indicates that the Parties understood that the Sukor6é Site
may not be available for the Project, such that the Concession Contract had to offer al-
ternatives.°° Respondent refers to Dr. Oszk6’s oral testimony during the Hearing in
which he explained that the Parties had two options in terms of pursuing the Project:
agree to restore the pre-swap conditions or otherwise proceed with the Project on an al-

ternative site.°*!

569. In any event, Respondent contends that the record shows that the Project Sponsors
were informed and knew that, failing an agreement with the Hungarian authorities, the

Land Swap Agreement would be referred to the courts,”

570. Respondent is of the view that the duties of good faith and cooperation cannot go be-

yond the unequivocal terms of the Concession Contract.

Respondent concludes that
Claimant had no expectation, much less a legal entitlement, that Respondent would ex-
tend the deadline. According to Respondent, “[t]here was in this respect no legal obli-
gation to be performed by Hungary in good faith, whether under international law or

Hungarian law, and moreover no duty of cooperation beyond the clear terms of the

Concession Contract.”*™*

571. In response to Claimant’s contention that the termination was “a disproportionate re-
sponse to what were relatively minor purported contractual breaches,” Respondent as-
serts that the principle of proportionality applies only to regulatory measures, but not
to “a State’s exercise of contractual rights as an ordinary contracting party.” With
regard to Claimant’s quotation from the case of Occidental v. Ecuador, Respondent
submits that the contract in that case was terminated by a ministerial decree, i.e., a

“purely regulatory measure,” as a sanction for the breach of a statute; consequently,

the decision cannot support Claimant’s argument that the proportionality principle can

also be applied to a State’s exercise of contractual rights.°°

572. In any event, Respondent contends that the termination of the Concession Contract

was “entirely proportionate,” given that Clause 15.2 did not provide for a notification

requirement or an opportunity to remedy deficiencies in relation to the termination
events invoked in the Termination Letter. Respondent argues that it was therefore enti-
tled to immediately terminate the Concession Contract in response to KC Bidding’s
breaches of contract.*” In addition, Respondent submits that, by failing to find an ap-
propriate site for the Project, “KC Bidding failed to comply with one of its core obliga-
tions under the Concession Contract”, thus, Respondent’s decision to terminate was

proportionate and legitimate.**

b) Respondent Did Not Frustrate Claimant’s Search for an Alternative Site

573. Respondent claims that, contrary to Claimant’s allegations, Claimant’s failure to certi-
fy “legitimate possession” of the Project site, as required under Clause 9.3 of the Con-
cession Contract, is a consequence of its own decision not to secure one of the availa-
ble Project sites within the deadline, and was not a result of Respondent’s conduct in
relation to the Land Swap Agreement.*?

574. Respondent submits that both parties executed the Concession Contract on the under-

standing that it had become “unlikely” that the Project would proceed in Sukor6.°”
Respondent argues that this is reflected in the drafting history of the Concession Con-
tract in which, at the request of Mr. Blum’s lawyer, Dr. Bard, all references to the Su-
kor6 Site were deleted and the Concession Contract was amended so that the Project
could proceed in any of 133 locations listed in Annex 1! In addition, Respondent as-
serts that, at the 5 October 2009 meeting with Messrs. Langhammer and Blum, Dr.
Oszk6 advised the Project Sponsors to identify an alternative location for the Pro-
ject.5%

575. Respondent submits that KC Bidding only formally reverted to the Sukor6 Site in the
weeks preceding the 1 January 2011 deadline, having failed to secure an alternative
site. Respondent is of the view that this was caused by the fact that Claimant had
failed to find a “suitable” alternative site and therefore “chose” to abandon the sites
that it had located for reasons unrelated to Respondent.°*

576. With regard to the potential site in Székesfehérvar, Respondent claims that Claimant’s
contentions are misleading. Respondent maintains that while the Council of
Székesfehérvar did seek to withdraw its support for the implementation of a casino on
that settlement, Dr. Oszk6 confirmed to the Székesfehérvar Council’s notary that
Székesfehérvar was bound by its earlier consent to the construction of a casino on its
settlement.©° Respondent submits that it was Claimant’s decision not to pursue this
site and refers to the statement of Mr. Gaye that “part of the land was a protected area

and therefore no development could be made.”°®

577. With regard to the Babolna site, Respondent claims that the documentary evidence
shows that the Project Sponsors chose not to participate in the Babolna tender in view
of the short deadline for submissions.”

578. As regards the Tatabanya site, Respondent again refers to Mr. Gaye, who confirmed in
his witness statement that this privately-owned site had “the right zoning” for the Pro-
ject, and that the owner was ready and willing to sell the land to Claimant. Respondent
submits that the deal fell through for reasons unknown and unexplained. Respondent
further submits that Claimant failed to explain why State support would have been
necessary in the context of the sale of privately-owned land and that Claimant never
sought assistance with respect to the acquisition of the Tatabanya site.*

579. Respondent also refers to correspondence between Mr. Gaye and Mr. Orban of Artonic
as evidence that Respondent did not in any way interfere with Claimant’s efforts to se-
cure an alternative site.°”

580. Respondent submits that, for reasons unrelated to Hungary, Claimant never even in-
formed the Government that it was actively searching for an alternative site, as Claim-
ant failed to comply with its reporting obligations under the Concession Contract,
which were “the intended vehicle for the investor to inform the government of its pro-
gress in locating a Project site?" Respondent asserts that the Government was kept
in the dark about the search for alternative sites, and thus was persuaded that the Pro-

ject Sponsors were no longer actively pursuing the Project.””!

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

581.

The Tribunal will consider whether the principle of good faith under Hungarian law or
international law required Respondent to refrain from exercising its contractual termi-
nation right.

582. Hungarian law governs the contractual analysis of the termination, and it requires a
contracting party to perform its agreement according to the principle of good faith and
cooperation. Article 4(1) of the Hungarian Civil Code states:

°7 Counter-Memorial, { 401; Exhibit R-93.

584.

585.

“In the course of exercising civil rights and fulfilling obligations, all
parties shall act in a manner required by good faith and mutual re-
spect, and they shall be obliged to cooperate with one another.”

Under Hungarian law, if the Government were found to have exercised its contractual
right of termination fictitiously or maliciously, it would have failed to act in good faith
and abused its right. In those circumstances, termination would be a breach of contract
actionable under Hungarian law. While contract breach under municipal law is not de-
terminative of a Treaty breach, it may be relevant to that decision if the breach consti-
tutes an abuse of right, and not a mere failure to perform.

At the same time, the Treaty and thus international law governs the decision of wheth-
er an expropriation occurred. Consequently, to the extent Hungary acted in its sover-
eign capacity and relied on public policy reasons in terminating the Concession Con-
tract, international law is implicated in deciding whether the State’s conduct is expro-
priatory. The Tribunal has already noted that there is common ground that good faith is
also a fundamental principle of public international law for the performance of interna-
tional obligations. It is applicable in assessing whether the State’s exercise of a legal
right, whether arising out of a contract or another source of law, is legitimate or
amounts to an abuse of such right in order to avoid liability to compensate. Under the
Treaty and international law addressing expropriation, if Hungary terminated the Con-
cession Contract solely for public policy reasons, acting in its sovereign capacity, then
its actions would constitute an expropriation. In making the determination of whether
it acted solely for public policy reasons, a municipal law contract breach would be rel-
evant as a factual element of the expropriation analysis if the Government articulated a
contractual basis for termination abusively, whether fictitiously or maliciously, in or-
der to avoid liability under the Treaty.

However, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the principle of good faith, wheth-
er under Hungarian law or under international law, informs the manner in which an in-
ternational or, in the case of Hungarian law a contractual, obligation is to be per-

formed, but it is not in itself an independent source of obligations.”

7 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, {| 27, 28. According to the International Court of Justice in the Border
and Transborder Armed Action case, “[t]he principle of good faith is, as the Court has observed, ‘one of the
basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations’ (Nuclear Tests, I.C.J. Reports
1974, p. 268, para. 46; p. 573, para. 49); it is not in itself a source of obligation where none would otherwise
exist.” Border and Transborder Armed Actions Case (Nicaragua v. Honduras), International Court of Justice,
Jurisdiction and Admissibility Judgment (20 December 1988), Exhibit RLA-78, and Nuclear Tests Case
(Australia v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, 253, Exhibit CLA-41.

a)

587.

In the Tribunal’s view, the impact of the obligation of good faith on the present case
cannot be decided in the abstract, but depends on the concrete circumstances under
which the Concession Contract was negotiated and executed. In its analysis, the Tribu-
nal will have particular regard to (i) the Parties’ discussions regarding the Land Swap
Agreement and their corresponding expectations regarding the availability of the Su-
kor6 Site for the Project prior to the signing of the Concession Contract, (ii) the role of
the 132 alternative settlements as potential sites, and (iii) the reasons for Claimant’s
decision not to certify a site for the Project at any of those 132 alternative settlements.

Uncertainties Regarding the Availability of the Sukoré Site at the Time the Con-
cession Contract Was Signed

In the Tribunal’s view, the record shows that when KC Bidding signed the Concession
Contract, it knew that the Sukor6é Site might not be available for the Project. A clear
piece of evidence for this is Dr. Oszk6’s letter to Mr. Blum, dated 4 September 2009,
more than a month before the Concession Contract was signed, in which Dr. Oszké
stated:

“As it is known to you, the swap transaction related to the Sukoré
properties has given rise to significant negative reactions on behalf
of the general public in the recent weeks. Moreover, several specific
legal concerns have occurred with regard to the property swap
which has also been objected to recently by the Hungarian State Au-
dit Office in the recent past. With regard to the above, I consider a
review of the recent events necessary because, it is my well-grounded
opinion that an investment project which is granted special treatment
from the aspect of national economy can only be implemented if it is
done without any objections pertaining to prevailing law and the
public opinion.

Tam of the opinion that in the present situation, we need to find a so-
lution for the legal concerns and those raised by the general public
in relation to the property swap transaction. With regard to the latter
and considering the fact that even the State Audit Office considered
the property swap transaction to be legally null and void in its re-
port, it is raised as a possibility that clarification of legal doubts and
concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous owner-
ships of the properties involved in the swap transaction. Naturally,
apart from and beyond these facts, I would still like to know the in-
vestor’s position and solution proposals considering the legal and
societal concerns occurring in wide circles, as well as the report of
the State Audit Office and the prosecutorial procedures in progress
before the competent state attorney offices with regard to the invest-
ment project.

588.

589.

590.

I recommend that the problems be discussed at a personal meeting
and for this purpose, I hereby request that you kindly contact my sec-
retariat at the following phone number: [...].”

The Tribunal is aware that the State Audit Office is not a judicial body that would be
empowered to declare the Land Swap Agreement null and void. Nevertheless, Dr.
Oszké sent his letter of 4 September 2009 to Mr. Blum quite obviously in reaction both
to publicity and to the legal concerns raised in the State Audit Office report. He re-
ferred to the fact that “even the State Audit Office considered the property swap trans-
action to be legally null and void” and raised “a possibility that clarification of legal
doubts and concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous ownership of
the properties involved in the swap transaction.”

The Project Sponsors clearly understood the import of this letter. Mr. Blum immediate-
ly forwarded it to Mr. Langhammer. The record shows that, following receipt of the
letter, Mr. Langhammer instructed Mr. Blum to seek legal advice.“ Four days later, in
an opinion dated 8 September 2009, Dr. Varga, Mr. Blum’s Hungarian attorney, ad-
dressed the risks regarding both the disproportionality of value and the public interest
requirement that served as the basis for the opinion of the State Audit Office.”° With
respect to the latter, Dr. Varga stated:

“[I]t shall be noted that there is no provision of law, or any relevant
court decision delivered in a similar case, which would allow for the
acquisition of the whole territory of the property even if the public
interest objective could be achieved by acquiring just a part of it. In
lack of any guidance from legislation, this issue can only be settled
by the assessment of all available data and documents regarding the
given case, or before a court.”7°°

Thus, Dr. Varga explicitly raised the issue whether the public interest objective al-
lowed the acquisition of the whole territory of Mr. Blum’s properties that were to be
swapped for the Sukor6 Site given that the public interest objective could be achieved
by acquiring only part of Mr. Blum’s properties — the precise issue that later served as
the basis for the Curia’s finding that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void.

It is common ground that Dr. Oszk6’s letter of 4 September 2009 was followed by two

personal meetings with the Minister in Hungary, the first on 10 September 2009, be-
tween Dr. Oszk6 and Mr. Blum, and the second on 5 October 2009, when Dr. Oszk6
met with both Mr. Langhammer and Mr. Blum. The testimonies of the participants dif-

fer as to exactly what was said at those meetings.

592. With regard to the first meeting on 10 September 2009, Mr. Blum stated in his first

witness statement:

“Dr. Oszk6 behaved cautiously during this meeting.

[...] [He] repeat[ed] the concerns he raised in his letter of 4 Septem-
ber 2009. Indeed, it appeared to me that he was simply reading out
his letter to me. [...] It seemed that he was unsure what to say.”" 7

593. In his second witness statement, Mr. Blum further stated:

594.

“[T]o the best of my recollection Dr. Oszk6 did not mention the pos-
sibility of restarting the land swap ‘afresh’ at this meeting. I am sure
that I would recall if he had done so, given that I would have been
open to discussing the possibility as a means of neutralising the ad-
verse media attacks orchestrated by Fidesz around the land

swap.”

meeting on 10 September 2009:

“T explained to Mr. Blum that it was essential that a project of this
importance be based on solid legal grounds and the acquisition of
the land be conducted in a transparent manner, unlike what hap-
pened. I told him I was concerned that the legality of the Land Swap
Agreement would not be upheld in a court of law, and proposed to
start afresh the acquisition of the land in Sukoré. Mr. Blum insisted
that the Land Swap Agreement was valid and that this transaction
should be left untouched.

He offered to pay Hungary a supplement that would correct any mis-
take made in the valuations. This was not acceptable as a matter of
Hungarian law.”

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

“Mr. Blum states that I did not mention the possibility of starting the
land swap transaction afresh. This is incorrect. That possibility was
the main purpose for which I had organized the meeting. I had clear-
ly announced this in my letter to Mr. Blum dated 4 September 2009
[...] The relevant part of the English translation of this letter pro-
vides that ‘it is raised as a possibility that clarification of legal doubts
and concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous own-
erships of the properties involved in the swap transaction.’ The pur-
pose of our meeting was to discuss the possibility of starting the pro-
cess again and we definitely discussed this at the meeting.

[...] I distinctly recall explaining my concern that the validity of the
Land Swap Agreement would not be confirmed by a court of law.”""°

596. In his oral testimony at the Hearing, Dr. Oszk6 stated in relation to the 10 September
2009 meeting:

“[A]s I remember, we’ve discussed whether we can restore the origi-
nal situation and if yes, then how the lands can be acquired proper-
pom!

597. Concerning the second meeting among Dr. Oszk6, Mr. Blum and Mr. Langhammer on
5 October 2009, Mr. Blum claims that Dr. Oszk6 said nothing about terminating the
Land Swap Agreement and, instead, noted that the values of the swapped lands could
be “validated” by referral to a competent court.

598. In his first witness statement, Mr. Blum stated:

“We also discussed the Land Swap Agreement. Dr. Oszk6 explained
the public pressure on him to investigate the values of the properties
involved in the land swap. He mentioned that it was possible he
would need to initiate a court procedure in order to validate the val-
ues of those properties. He emphasised that, if there had been impro-
priety in the valuation, this was solely the responsibility of the MNV.
Dr. Oszk6 noted that it was his responsibility to find out whether
anything improper had indeed occurred with the valuation, since he
was ultimately responsible for the careers of the MNV officials pre-
sent in the room.”""

599. In his second witness statement, Mr. Blum again stated:

“Dr. Oszk6 made no mention of recommencing the land swap trans-
action. Instead, as I have indicated previously, Dr. Oszk6 explained
the public pressure on him to investigate the MNV’s calculation of
the values of the properties that had been swapped.

Mr. Langhammer, who was present at the meeting of 5 October,
asked Dr. Oszké if there were any substantive problems with the
transaction itself, other than the concerns about the MNV’s valua-
tions. Dr. Oszko replied that there were none. Only the values of the
swapped lands were at issue, Dr. Oszk6 noted, and he stated that the
values could be ‘validated’ by referral to a competent court. Dr.
Oszk6 said nothing about terminating the Land Swap Agreement. If
he had done this, it would have been a very serious matter for the
Project Sponsors. I would have reacted to him and taken immediate
action in response. In fact, Dr. Oszk6 only mentioned the issue of
value, and this is why I offered to pay a supplement to make up the
difference between the valuations conducted. If Dr. Oszk6 had raised
wider issues of legality, I would not have done so as it would not
have made sense to offer to pay the difference between valuations if
there were outstanding legal issues.”

600. In his testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Blum said with regard to the 5 October 2009
meeting:

“[Dr. Oszk6] did not raise the issue of the Land Swap Agreement. He
raised the issue of value that were creating what he called public
concern, et cetera [...J7*

[...] and said that the issue of difference in value needs to be re-
solved.

[...] [O]ne of his further comments was that it might be that the issue
of values needs to be validated by a Court. The Court will consider
and will check the issue of difference in value and will validate this
concern and this issue.”'°

601. Mr. Langhammer, who attended only the 5 October 2009 meeting with Dr. Oszk6,
stated in his first witness statement:

“At that meeting, we discussed the land swap agreement that was by
then in place between Mr. Blum and the MNV. Dr. Oszk6 informed
us that it was his intention to validate the land swap agreement be-
fore a Hungarian court in order to confirm that the valuation of the
swapped properties had been properly executed by the MNV. We did
not envisage any difficulties with the validation procedure proposed
by Dr. Oszk6. Indeed, my sense was that such a court validation pro-
cess could be a helpful step for all parties in clarifying the position. I
also felt that it would take the sting out of the attacks being made by
Fidesz by de-politicising the valuation issue. No indication of any le-
gal concerns regarding the land swap itself was made by either Dr.
Oszko or the other MNV officials present. Dr. Oszk6 stated that the
Concession Contract would be signed shortly.

Mr. Blum, Dr. Bard and I left the meeting with the Minister of Fi-
nance in a positive frame of mind. We all felt very confident that the
Project was moving forward towards development.” '

602. In his second witness statement, Mr. Langhammer said:

“T also raised the subject of the Land Swap Agreement at this meet-
ing. Specifically, I asked Dr. Oszk6 whether there were any legal
questions arising from the Land Swap Agreement, other than the val-
uation of the swapped properties. Dr. Oszk6 replied that there were
none.”

603. In his testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Langhammer stated:

“TAJll I recall is there is that Dr. Oszk6 mentioned to me that there
was no other legal issues in this regard, and I said to him, If there’s
no other legal issues, then if Mr. Blum pays the difference, whatever
the valuation says, will this solve the problem?

And he said he may want to validate that through a court.”7°

604. Dr. Oszk6, on the other hand, stated in his first witness statement, with regard to the
5 October 2009 meeting:

“T reiterated that I was concerned with the validity of the Land Swap
Agreement and that my recommendation was to terminate that
Agreement on a consensual basis in order to start the acquisition
afresh in a transparent manner. I further explained to Mr. Blum and
Mr. Langhammer that, failing any agreement, I would be compelled
to refer the question of the validity of the Land Swap Agreement to
the courts. Finally, I mentioned that considering the situation, the
Project Sponsors should identify an alternative location for the Pro-
ject.”

second witness statement, Dr. Oszké testified:

“I distinctly recall recommending at the 5 October 2009 meeting that
the Land Swap Agreement be terminated on a consensual basis. My
position in that regard merely reiterated what I had expressed to Mr.
Blum during our 10 September 2009 meeting. And, as set forth in my
first witness statement, while the discrepancy between the valuations
of the swapped properties was certainly a key issue, my concern with
the Land Swap Agreement was not limited to that; it extended to the
transaction as a whole, which lacked transparency and appeared to
have been concluded in dubious conditions.

I also explained to Mr. Langhammer and Mr. Blum that, failing an
agreement, I would be compelled to refer the question of the validity
of the Land Swap Agreement to the courts. Mr. Langhammer con-
tends that I never said I would be ‘compelled’ but rather that I was
‘considering making such a referral.’ Mr. Langhammer is playing
with semantics here. I do not recall the precise wording I used but I
am positive that I informed the investors that the Land Swap Agree-
ment would be referred to the courts if it was not terminated consen-
sually. Those were the only two available alternatives to resolve the
Land Swap Agreement deadlock.”””

Page -162-

606. In his testimony at the Hearing, when asked about Mr. Blum’s and Mr. Langhammer’s

statements that there was no discussion at all about the restoration of the pre-swap

conditions at the 5 October 2009 meeting, Dr. Oszk6 replied:

“This was part of the letter I sent in September, so this issue was
raised even a month ago. So I’m just surprised how I could — how it
would have been possible not to discuss that issue since it is the main
issue I have raised already a month before, discussed once with Mr.
Blum and that was the only occasion that I had a discussion with Mr.
Langhammer. It would have been very strange not to discuss the is-

sue. That was perhaps the most important issue at that time concern-
ing the project.

[..-]

On the discussion of the Sth of October, the issue was not simply the
valuation. The issue was whether the transaction was made properly
and if not, how can we solve the situation.?”*

607. The foregoing shows that the main point of disagreement between the witnesses is
whether Dr. Oszk6 indicated at these meetings that Mr. Blum should restore the pre-
swap situation and whether Dr. Oszk6 made it clear that failing an agreement with
Mr. Blum, Respondent would refer the question of the validity of the Land Swap
Agreement to the Hungarian courts. As regards the 5 October 2009 meeting,
Mr. Langhammer’s recollection is that Dr. Oszk6 said there were no legal questions
arising from the Land Swap Agreement other than the value of the swapped properties,
and that the court would be asked to “validate” the correct value in order to “confirm
that the valuation of the swapped properties had been properly executed by the MNV.”
Dr. Oszk6, on the other hand, testified in both of his witness statements that he com-
municated to Mr. Blum and Mr. Langhammer on 5 October 2009 that, failing an
agreement with Mr. Blum, he would be compelled to refer the question of the validity
of the Land Swap Agreement to the courts, although Dr. Oszk6’s oral testimony during
the Hearing created doubt as to whether this was actually the case.”°5

608. The Tribunal has no basis to prefer the recollection of one witness over that of another.
However, the record shows that the Project Sponsors received various warning signals
before they signed the Concession Contract. These warning signs include Dr. Oszké6’s
letter of 4 September 2009 and Dr. Varga’s opinion of 8 September 2009. In addition,
as already noted above, Dr. Oszk6 and Dr. Budai held a joint press conference before
the Ministry of Finance on 8 October 2009, i.e., the day before the signing of the Con-
cession Contract. During the press conference, Dr. Budai declared that he was of the
view that the Land Swap Agreement was a void agreement and that the Minister of Fi-
nance should terminate the Land Swap Agreement with immediate effect.’
Dr. Oszk6’s position during this press conference was cited as follows:

“[Dr. Oszk6] highlighted that the concerns in connection with the ca-
sino investment in Sukoro are related to the plot exchange agreement
and the value proportionality. According to him, a deadline should
be set for reaching an agreement with the investor, and in case it is
not reached, the asset manager shall think about legal steps.

Peter Oszk6 added that they will try to reach primarily the cheapest
solution, from the aspect of the state and highlighted that the termi-
nation of the agreement has to be compared with all the other such
possibilities by which they could possibly reach a similar result,
however, by involving less risk for the State.””"

In these circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced that the outcome of the meeting
of 5 October 2009 was that the court proceedings in Hungary would serve the sole
purpose of “validating” the Land Swap Agreement in order to confirm that the valua-
tion of the swapped properties had been properly executed by the MNV, and that there
were no other legal concerns arising from the Land Swap Agreement. It is normally
not the role of a court to “validate” valuations of properties. It may well be that there
was a misunderstanding between Mr. Langhammer and Dr. Oszké as to the purpose of
the possible court proceedings. But on balance, the Tribunal cannot share Claimant’s
position that the potential invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement, which had been
mentioned by Dr. Oszké in his letter of 4 September 2009 with reference to the opin-
ion of the State Audit Office, was no longer an issue.

On the other hand, the Tribunal is not convinced that Respondent, at any time before
the Concession Contract was signed, indicated to Claimant that it considered the Land
Swap Agreement to be null and void as a matter of law prior to the Hungarian courts’
tuling on the issue. There is no evidence in the record to support such a position. In
particular, Dr. Oszk6’s letter of 4 September 2009, relied upon by Respondent in this
regard, referred to the opinion of the State Audit Office but did not state that it reflect-
ed his own opinion or the Government’s position generally. The fact that Respondent
at the time considered a court decision necessary in order to “invalidate” the Land
Swap Agreement is also reflected in Dr. Oszk6’s instructions to Dr. Janos Nagy, Presi-
dent of the NVT, on 8 October 2009.’”* It is true that the record shows that the new
Fidesz Government apparently took the view in 2010 that the Land Swap Agreement
was null and void, without the need for a court decision. However, at the time the
Concession Contract was signed, there is no evidence that such view was communicat-
ed to Claimant.

613.

On the balance of the evidence, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that, at the date of
signing the Concession Contract, Claimant must have known that although the Sukoré
Site was not off the table, failing an agreement with Mr. Blum on the restoration of the
previous ownerships, as mentioned in Dr. Oszk6’s letter of 4 September 2009, this
would become the subject matter of court proceedings. The Tribunal is aware that
Mr. Blum stated that he was “surprised and shocked” on learning, in the afternoon
of 9 October 2009 after signing the Concession Contract, of the press release regarding
Dr. Oszk6’s instruction to the NVT to “take the necessary legal steps to invalidate the
land-swap contract.” Mr. Langhammer also testified during the Hearing that the

“ 40 him 73
press release “was a shock” to him.”*!

However, the Tribunal is of the view that it must
have been clear to the Project Sponsors that such court proceedings would concern not
only the possible disproportionality of the values of the swapped properties, but also
the potential invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement. The issue of the potential inva-
lidity of the Land Swap Agreement had been raised by the State Audit Office and in
Dr. Oszko’s letter of 4 September 2009 and both issues — the valuation issue and the

potential invalidity — had been identified in Dr. Varga’s opinion of 8 September 2009.

The Tribunal further observes that, if the Project Sponsors had really understood that
the potential invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement was no longer an issue, one might
have expected an immediate reaction from them after reading the Ministry’s press re-
lease of 9 October 2009, as was the case on other occasions. In particular when the
Special Project Status was revoked in November 2010, the Project Sponsors reacted
with a series of letters to Government representatives. After the Ministry’s press re-
lease, the Project Sponsors could have written a letter of complaint to Dr. Oszk6 or
they could have requested a meeting — which undisputedly did not happen. Rather,
Mr. Blum entered into negotiations with the MNV and, when these negotiations failed,
the Project Sponsors began to look for alternatives sites.

The Introduction of 132 Alternative Settlements for the Project Site

In these circumstances, the question arises why Claimant agreed in the Concession
Contract to the deadline of 1 January 2011 for certifying the legitimate possession of
the properties needed for the Project. As stated above, Claimant attempted to negotiate
a much longer period, i.e., until 1 January 2014. That proposal had been made by
Dr. Bard on 8 September 2009 at a meeting with Mr. Arvai at the Ministry of Finance

when the first draft of the Concession Contract was discussed, and thus at a point in
time when the Project Sponsors were already on notice of the legal concerns surround-
ing the Land Swap Agreement. Nevertheless, when Respondent refused to agree to the
proposed extension, they ultimately accepted the original deadline of 1 January 2011
provided in the first draft. In the Tribunal’s view, it must have been clear to the Project
Sponsors, who were advised by Hungarian counsel, that such deadline would probably
be too short for any final decision to be rendered if the question of the validity of the
Land Swap Agreement were to be submitted to the Hungarian courts.

The Tribunal concludes from this that the Project Sponsors must have known upon
entering into the Concession Contract that, failing an agreement between Mr. Blum
and Respondent, the validity of the Land Swap Agreement would be brought before
the Hungarian courts, making it uncertain whether they could certify the Sukoré Site as
the site for the Project by the contractual deadline. It appears that the Project Sponsors
accepted this risk because it was balanced by the inclusion of the 132 alternative sites.
The Tribunal has no reason to believe that the contractual deadline of 1 January 2011 —
which gave Claimant fourteen and a half months — provided too short a time period in
which to acquire an alternative site for the Project.

The Reasons for Claimant’s Decision Not to Certify an Alternative Site

In the Tribunal’s view, Claimant has not established its allegation that the new Gov-
emment actively frustrated its search for an alternative site. The record shows that
Claimant considered at least three alternative sites in the relevant time period between
October/November 2009’ and the fall of 2010: Székesfehérvar, Bébolna and Tata-
banya.

After Claimant identified Székesfehérvar as a potential site for the Project, the
Székesfehérvar Council issued a decision on 3 December 2009 reversing its original
support for the operation of a mega-casino in its settlement.”** The record shows that,
in withdrawing its consent to have the Project located at its settlement, the Székesfehé-
rvar Council followed an initiative of the Fidesz Party. On 26 February 2010,

” Exhibit C-280.

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22

Mr. Gaye wrote to Dr. Oszk6, requesting the assistance of the Ministry of Finance re-
garding this decision of the Székesfehérvar Council. Mr. Gaye alternatively requested
that the contractual deadline to secure a Project site be extended from 1 January 2011
to 1 June 2011 to compensate for time wasted searching for sites in Székesfehérvar.”™*
617. Dr. Oszk6 responded to Mr. Benkley on 8 March 2010, enclosing a copy of a letter he
had written on the same date to Dr. Viktor Boka of the Székesfehérvar Mayor’s Office,
stating that the decision of the Székesfehérvar Council had no effect upon the Conces-
sion Contract and that Székesfehérvar continued to be available as a potential location
for the casino.” This shows that at least the interim Government of Prime Minister
Bajnai supported Claimant’s position that it could legally secure a Székesfehérvar site.

618. Following this letter, according to the witness statement of Mr. Gaye, Claimant had
several meetings with the owner of the Székesfehérvar land being considered by
Claimant. However, the Project Sponsors “realized through consultation with [their]
local architect, Mr. Orbdn of Artonic, that part of that land was a protected area and
therefore no development could be made. As a result, [they] decided not to pursue this
site further.”7° This shows that Claimant decided not to pursue this site for its own

reasons.

619. With regard to the Babolna site, Mr. Gaye met with the Mayor of Babolna, Dr. Klara
Horvath, in November 2009 and again in January 2010, to discuss whether a site in
Babolna could be used for the Project.”*7 At the 21 January 2010 meeting at the
Babolna Town Hall concerning administrative procedures related to the Project (ob-
taining the relevant permits and licences), Mayor Horvath “offered her help and her

own contacts to support the whole procedure.””®

620. On 10 August 2010, the Municipality of Babolna announced a tender for the sale of the
potential Babolna site for the Project. Six days later, on 16 August 2010, Dr. Budai de-

livered a press conference in which he accused Mayor Horvath of corruption and the

739 +

forgery of a public document’~” in connection with an unrelated transaction which also

involved the sale of land in Babolna.’*° During the press conference, Dr. Budai re-
marked that “Babolna was also one of these localities which showed up as a possibility

when it turned out that no casino investment project was possible in Sukor6,” and that
he was “not at all surprised about this new transaction by Klara Horvath." Accord-
ing to Claimant, and undisputed by Respondent, Dr. Budai’s allegations against Mayor
Horvath subsequently proved to be baseless.”

Claimant decided not to participate in the tender. Claimant submits that it was forced
to abandon Babolna as a potential site for the Project in light of the “toxic political en-
vironment created by Dr. Budai and the [Fidesz] Government he served.”"™ However,
at the same time, Mr. Gaye informed Mr. Ben Molever of Miller Buckfire on 18 Au-
gust 2010 that KC Management would not participate in the tender because “there is a
strong chance that this tender will be cancelled’ and the municipality of Babolna
“want[s] offers in two weeks with detailed plans which make it unreasonable for
us.”™ Tt thus appears that the timing played a role in Claimant’s decision not to partic-
ipate in the tender for the site. Under these circumstances, Claimant has not evidenced
that it was “compelled” to abandon this site because of the Fidesz Government’s inter-
ference.

In May 2010, Claimant’s investment bankers of Miller Buckfire also visited the Tata-
banya site. Claimant submits that the owner of the site was ready and willing to sell the
land to Claimant for realization of the Project. A draft purchase contract was prepared
and Claimant entered into negotiations with the owner regarding the purchase price of
the land.” Claimant claims that because the Fidesz Government repeatedly failed to
provide the Project with the support that was integral to its success (i.e., refusing to
meet with Claimant’s representatives to discuss the future of the Project), Claimant did
not wish to spend money on the Tatabanya site and decided not to pursue it.“ In the
Tribunal’s view, the Fidesz Government’s general lack of support for the Project does
not amount to actively frustrating Claimant’s search for an alternative site.

While the evidence indicates that the Fidesz Party, before coming to power after the
national elections, sought to make a Székesfehérvar site unavailable for the Project, the

website for at least 30 days and to express their regret over the violations of Hungarian law and to pay damag-

interim Government intervened to maintain its availability, and Claimant admits that it
did not pursue this site for other reasons. Similarly, while Dr. Budai may have at-
tempted to make a Babolna site difficult by his public statements, Claimant again, by
its own admission, failed to pursue the site for other reasons. Thus, Claimant has not
established a causal link between the actions of the Government and its failure to ob-
tain an alternative site.

In conclusion, the record does not establish that Respondent prevented Claimant from
obtaining an alternative site. In the Tribunal’s view, despite the hostility to the Project
being located at the Sukor6 site, Claimant had a realistic opportunity to secure an al-
ternative site within the contractual deadline, had it not apparently reduced its search
efforts in the course of 2010. There is indeed no evidence in the record that Claimant
made any further search efforts after August 2010. The Tribunal understands that the
reason for Claimant’s reduced efforts was its perception that the Fidesz Government
was failing to provide the Project with support, in particular, by refusing to meet with
Claimant’s representatives and by failing to confirm its continued support for the Pro-
ject in general.

While Claimant argues that a Project of this magnitude could hardly be successful
without governmental support, it must be observed that the Concession Contract did
not provide for any form of support by the Government, be it in the form of infrastruc-
ture or financial or political support. In contracting with a State, there is an inherent
risk that successive governments will change their policy. Had Claimant wished to en-
sure governmental support, it could have negotiated and incorporated specific contrac-
tual obligations to this effect in the Concession Contract. In the Tribunal’s view, hav-
ing failed to do so, Claimant may not now invoke the principle of good faith to create
new and specific obligations on behalf of the Government.

What Claimant had a right to expect was that the Government, having signed the Con-
cession Contract, would perform it in good faith and cooperate with Claimant in ac-
cordance with the Concession Contract. But this Hungarian law obligation did not re-
quire the Government to forego its contractually-agreed right to terminate the Conces-
sion Contract when it was factually and legally supported, especially when the specific
risk at issue was contractually allocated to Claimant by the inclusion of 132 alternative
sites.

In these circumstances, it was at Claimant’s own risk that it decided not to pursue its
search for alternative sites. Likewise, it was Claimant’s own decision to certify Sukoré
as the site for the Project on 21 December 2010, despite being aware of the legal un-
certainties concerning this site, and after having received Dr. Kardkovacs’ response to

Mr. Langhammer’s 24 November 2010 letter on 17 December 2010, which did not
contain the statement of support that the Project Sponsors had requested.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion

Considering that Respondent added the deadline of 1 January 2011, and the 132 alter-
native sites, to the Concession Contract specifically to deal with the issue of the uncer-
tainty relating to the Sukor6 Site as the location for the Project and to enable the Pro-
ject Sponsors to “realize the casino project within the region in line with the law,” the
Tribunal is of the view that Respondent’s exercise of its contractual termination right
on the ground that Claimant had not certified the “/egitimate right to possession” of the
Sukor6 Site does not demonstrate a lack of good faith on the part of the Government or
an abuse of its rights under Hungarian law. The same is true for Respondent’s refusal
to extend the deadline until “/2 months from the date when the so-called Sukor6 court
case will be finished with a legally binding decision.”

In this regard, the Tribunal has also taken into account the fact that, according to
Dr. Budai’s frank statement, the impact of the cancellation of Special Project Status
was that the Project Sponsors would face “a far longer process” to obtain a license or
permission by established procedures. 4” However, the Tribunal has already noted that
Special Project Status was Sukoré-specific and could not have been used to accelerate
the administrative process at any of the alternative sites. Mr. Langhammer’s letter of
24 November 2010 shows that the Project Sponsors were aware of this as they request-
ed confirmation that they would obtain a new special project status once they had ob-
tained a new site. Under these circumstances, Dr. Budai’s statement does not change
the Tribunal’s conclusion that Respondent did not abuse its rights in terminating the
Concession Contract and refusing to grant Claimant’s request to extend the contractual
deadline.

As discussed above, in a situation in which Respondent had both a public policy rea-
son and a contractual reason for terminating the Concession Contract, Claimant’s ex-
propriation claim could only be successful if it proved that Respondent exercised its
contractual termination right contrary to good faith or abused such right in order to
avoid its liability to compensate under the Treaty. On the balance of the evidence, the
Tribunal is of the view that Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proof that
there was such conduct on the part of Respondent.

631. Finally, the Tribunal has also taken into consideration Claimant’s argument that the
termination of the Concession Contract was a “disproportionate response” to the pur-
ported breaches.”* The Tribunal already noted above that it considers Claimant’s fail-
ure to secure a Project site within the time period provided for in the Concession Con-
tract to be a material breach of the Concession Contract, which involved the very first
step in realizing the Project. Thus, the Tribunal is of the view that this case is unlike
the case of Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador, ™ cited by Claimant in this context,’” in
which the investor’s contract was terminated after Occidental performed the Contract,
or at least substantially performed it, spending hundreds of millions of dollars explor-
ing for oil, drilling wells, producing oil, and marketing it. Because of the advanced
stage of contract performance, the Occidental Tribunal was required to determine if the
termination was proportional to the breach. By contrast, since contract performance in
this case involved only the first, threshold step for performance, which was never con-
summated, no proportionality analysis can or need be performed.

632. As a final conclusion, the Tribunal holds that Claimant has not established that Re-
spondent’s termination of the Concession Contract, as a matter of fact, amounted to an
expropriation of Claimant’s investment pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Treaty. Conse-
quently, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant’s claim in its entirety, thus granting Re-
spondent’s request as set out above at paragraph 243 (i). As regards Respondent’s re-
quest set out at paragraph 243 (ii), i.e., to declare that Respondent did not expropriate
Claimant’s investment in Hungary, the Tribunal denies this request as being unneces-
sary in that such declaration is implicit in the Tribunal’s decision to reject Claimant’s
claims in their entirety.

e) Final Observation

633. As a final observation, the Tribunal notes that during the course of the Project and its
negotiation, certain anti-Semitic remarks were published about the Project or its Spon-
sors.’*! In Claimant’s view, Respondent did not take any actions against the persons

responsible for these anti-Semitic incidents and therefore violated its duty not to act in
a discriminatory way.” Although the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction beyond the
expropriation determination, the Cyprus-Hungary BIT itself does impose anti-
discrimination obligations on the State (duty not to impair the operation, management,
use, enjoyment, or disposal of the investment by discriminatory measures in Article
3(1); duty not to deprive investors of their investment unless the measures are not dis-
criminatory in Article 4(1)(b)). The Tribunal also recalls that the tribunal in FFIC v.
Mexico held that discrimination may also, to a certain extent, be relevant to the deter-
mination of whether an expropriation occurred.”** The Tribunal takes these concerns
of discrimination very seriously. Remarks such as those published are always a con-
cern. However, the Tribunal has not found any such remarks that are clearly attributa-
ble to the State.”* In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal also cannot find a
causal link between the publications in question and the termination of the Concession
Contract since Respondent had a legitimate contractual basis for such termination. In
addition, the Tribunal has noted that Respondent distanced itself from these remarks in
its Counter-Memorial.”> Dr. Orban, the Fidesz Government Prime Minister, also stat-
ed publicly that there was no place for anti-Semitism in Hungary and that “he and the
rest of the country would protect Hungary’s Jewish population.”"*° Thus, the Tribunal
cannot find that the contractual termination in question was discriminatory.

SUMMARY OF THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALY:

 

To summarize its decision, the Tribunal emphasizes the following:

(i) | It is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal has jurisdiction only
to determine whether Claimant’s investment was expropriated

(ii) Claimant’s expropriation claim is based primarily on Respondent’s termination
of the Concession Contract, purportedly on contractual grounds

(iii) The Tribunal cannot find an expropriatory effect based on the pre-termination
conduct of Respondent

The Tribunal determined that in order to sustain its claim that the termination of
the Concession Contract was expropriatory, Claimant must prove that:

(1) Respondent acted in its sovereign capacity in terminating the Con-
cession Contract, such as for a non-contractual public policy reason, and

(2) Respondent did not legitimately terminate the Concession Contract
based on a contractual ground. The latter element involves proving that: (i)
the contract was not terminated by the contractual procedure but rather by
legislative act or executive decree, or (ii) even if the contractual procedure
was used, that the factual and/or legal basis for the invoked contractual
grounds for termination did not exist, or (iii) if it did exist, that the State
invoked such basis abusively, i.e., either fictitiously as a mere pretext for
other reasons or maliciously, thereby failing to act in good faith.

In this case, both Hungarian law and international law are relevant. Hun-
garian law governs the contractual analysis of the termination, but the
Treaty and thus international law governs the decision of whether an ex-
propriation occurred. To the extent Hungary acted in its sovereign capacity
for a public policy reason in terminating the Concession Contract, interna-
tional law is implicated in deciding if its conduct is expropriatory. The
good faith standard and the related concept of abuse of rights are clearly
part of Hungarian law for performance of contracts. The good faith stand-
ard is also part of international law applicable in assessing whether the
State’s exercise of a legal right, whether arising out of a contract or another
source of law, is legitimate or amounts to an abuse of such right in order to
avoid liability under the Treaty.

At the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal noted that the Concession Contract was
terminated by the contractual procedure, not by legislative act or decree.

As a first step in its analysis, the Tribunal determined that Respondent did termi-
nate the Concession Contract in part based on a public policy reason, and thus
acted in its sovereign capacity, to that extent, in doing so. Specifically, Respond-
ent terminated the Concession Contract in part based on new environmental and
touristic public policies. In addition, concerns about corruption in the land swap,
although such concerns ultimately proved unfounded, may also have played a
role in the Government’s decision to terminate the Concession Contract.

In the second step of its assessment, the Tribunal determined that two of Re-
spondent’s stated reasons for termination did not legally justify termination of

the Concession Contract, but a third reason stated by Respondent was expressly
provided in the Concession Contract as a basis for termination and did involve a
good faith exercise of the termination right. The termination was based on the
failure of Claimant to perform a material, or core, obligation of the Concession
Contract, and in fact, the very first step in realizing the Project (i.e., securing a
site for the construction of the Project within the time period provided in the
Concession Contract). Although Claimant obtained possession of the Sukor6 Site
and designated it, Claimant never obtained legitimate possession of, and the right
to build on, that site because the Land Swap Agreement was null and void ipso
jure for failure to satisfy the public interest requirement. Serious concerns about
this issue were known to Claimant at the time the Concession Contract was
signed, and precisely because the Government was going to submit the validity
of the Land Swap Agreement to the courts for judicial determination (absent an
agreement with Mr. Blum), the Government included in the Contract a list of 133
potential sites (still including Sukor6 as one of them) at which the Project could
be located. Claimant thus had ample options but failed to secure any site other
than Sukor6, thereby assuming the risk that it would not have a valid title. Thus,
the Government had a contractual basis for termination.

(viii) Moving to the third step, the Tribunal decided that Respondent did not exercise

its contractual termination right fictitiously or maliciously, and therefore did not
abuse it. While Claimant presented some evidence indicating that the Fidesz Par-
ty, while in opposition, sought to frustrate the search for three alternative sites,
for two of those sites the evidence shows that Claimant had other reasons for not
securing them. As regards the third site, Claimant alleges only that the Fidesz
Government, once it came to power, failed to meet with Claimant’s representa-
tives and provide support for the Project. However, this is an insufficient reason
for not securing a site, as required by the Concession Contract. Respondent was
required to perform the Concession Contract, as agreed and in good faith, but it
was not legally required to provide general political support for the Project be-
yond the terms of the Concession Contract. Thus, the Tribunal cannot find any
causal link between the actions of the Government and the failure of Claimant to
obtain an alternative site. The Tribunal also took into account in its analysis the
stage of the investment at the time of the termination. Claimant’s breach in-
volved the very first step in realizing the Project — securing a site on which to
build it. No construction or operations ever took place under the Concession
Contract. Thus, this case is unlike Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador in which the
investor’s contract was terminated after Occidental performed the contract, or at
least substantially performed it. Because of the advanced stage of contract per-

formance, the Occidental tribunal was required to determine if the termination
was proportional to the breach. Under the facts of this case, however, propor-
tionality of the termination is not an issue.

The heart of the issue is this. The Project straddled a national election campaign
and two government administrations. The first supported the Project, while the
second did not. This undoubtedly put Claimant’s investment in an unfortunate
situation. But while the Fidesz Government did not politically support the Pro-
ject, it did not breach the Concession Contract either. The Fidesz Party during
the 2010 political campaign attacked the Project primarily because of suspected
corruption in securing the Sukor6 Site, although it must be stressed again that no
corruption was ever proved. After the Fidesz Government took power in May
2010, it refused to meet with the Project Sponsors or offer the political support
requested by the Sponsors. Claimant in this case has emphasized that the Project
could not go forward and succeed without active government support. When it
failed to obtain that support from the new Government, Claimant seems to have
been unwilling to spend any more money and abandoned any real efforts to ob-
tain an alternative site. In fact, in light of Claimant’s insistence that the Project
could not succeed without the new Government’s active support, it seems doubt-
ful that Claimant would really have committed the EUR 800 million necessary to
build the Project at Sukoré, or elsewhere, without ongoing Government support,
which was not forthcoming. While Claimant alleged that the new Government
wished to destroy the Project, and presented some evidence to this effect, Claim-
ant never tested the Government’s intent to comply with the Concession Contract
by obtaining a site that would satisfy Claimant’s threshold contractual obliga-
tions. Since it failed to do so, Respondent had a legitimate contractual basis for
terminating the Concession Contract. Had Claimant obtained a legitimate right to
possession and the right to build on an alternative site, and certified it to the
Government before | January 2011, it would have satisfied its contractual obli-
gation and any termination at that point might well have been expropriatory. But
Claimant did not do so. Also, if Claimant had proved that the Government pre-
vented it from obtaining an alternative site, that might have been expropriatory,
but Claimant failed to prove such conduct. Therefore, on the facts before it, the
Tribunal concludes that there was a material breach of contract by Claimant jus-
tifying termination, and no proven abuse of right by Respondent; consequently,
Claimant’s investment was not expropriated by Respondent’s termination of the
Concession Contract.

VIII. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

635. In its Statement of Costs dated 21 March 2014, Claimant seeks to recover from Re-
spondent fees and expenses for legal services in the amount of EUR 6,988,039.09, fees
and expenses for experts in the amount of EUR 1,485,615.42, administrative fees of
ICSID and the Members of the Tribunal in the amount of EUR 289,855.07 and other
costs and expenses in the amount of EUR 205,501.15, totaling the amount of EUR
8,969,010.73.7°” Claimant also seeks interest on such amount at the three-month EU-
RIBOR rate plus 4%, compounded on a quarterly basis, until full payment is made.”

636. In Hungary’s Submission on Costs dated 21 March 2014, Respondent seeks to recover
from Claimant fees and expenses of legal counsel (incurred through 13 February 2014)
in the amount of USD 7,214,369,7° fees and expenses of its expert witnesses in the
amount of USD 1,336,620, the amounts paid to the ICSID Secretariat in the amount of
USD 375,000 and the expenses incurred by its representatives and witnesses in attend-
ing the hearings in Washington, D.C. in the amount of USD 32,161, totaling the
amount of USD 8,958,150.’

637. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the par-
ties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by
whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the
Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.”

638. Article 61(2) does not prescribe a particular test for tribunals to assess costs, nor does it
place any restrictions on a tribunal’s ability to do so. In light of this, the Tribunal un-
derstands the power granted under this Article to be broad, allowing the Tribunal dis-
cretion in making its determination.

639. Having taken into account all the circumstances of the case and exercising its discre-
tion, the Tribunal concludes that it is fair and appropriate that the Parties bear the costs

of the arbitration” in equal shares and that each Party bears its own costs and legal

fees. This conclusion is reached considering that, while Claimant has not prevailed on
its expropriation claim, the only claim over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction, it has
raised reasonable issues in good faith and presented an arguable case. Thus, the Tribu-
nal, acting within its sound discretion, rejects each Party’s application for costs.

IX. DECISION
