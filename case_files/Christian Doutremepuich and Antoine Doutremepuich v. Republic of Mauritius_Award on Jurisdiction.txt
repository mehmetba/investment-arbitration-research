Dispute

The Claimants allege that the Respondent, by its acts and omissions, breached various provisions of
the Treaty between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic
of Mauritius (individually the “Contracting State” and together the “Contracting States”) on the
Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed at Port Louis on 22 March 1973 (the “France-
Mauritius BIT” or “Treaty”),' and request, among other things, damages provisionally quantified

at EUR 11,600,000.

According to the Claimants, beginning in 2009, the relevant organs of the Respondent sought to
secure the involvement of the French Laboratory in order to enhance the forensic capability of
Mauritius. Wishing to expand the activities of the French Laboratory, and on the basis of preliminary
discussions with the Mauritian authorities, the Claimants undertook to establish a laboratory in

Mauritius for genetic and DNA analysis (the “Project” or “Mauritius Laboratory”).?

According to the Claimants, during 2013, the Project was submitted to the Board of Investment (the
“BOI”) of the Republic of Mauritius, which is in charge of the promotion and reception of foreign

investors to Mauritius Island.*

Notice of Arbitration, dated 30 March 2018, para. 7.

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

On 14 October 2014, the Prime Minister’s Office (the “PMO”) of the Respondent wrote a letter to
the BOI stating that there were no objections to the Project (the “No-Objection Letter”). The letter
stated that:

“This Office has consulted different stakeholders, including the Forensic Science Laboratory and

the Office of the Solicitor-General on the above proposal submitted by Prof. Doutremepuich in
regard to the above project.

Following views received, I am to inform you that we have no objection to the project. You may
liaise with Prof. Doutremepuich accordingly.”

 

On the basis of the above, the Claimants, among other things, created three companies in Mauritius:
(i) on 9 January 2015: International DNA Services Holding, held 90% by the First Claimant and 10%
by the Second Claimant (the “Holding Company”); (ii) on 23 February 2015: DNA Services
Mauritius Ltd, held 100% by the Holding Company; and (iii) on 24 September 2015: International
DNA Services, held 100% by the Holding Company (together the “Companies”).>

The Claimants contend that on 14 April 2016, after having studied an updated business plan, the PMO
rejected the Project without providing any reasons (the “Rejection Letter”). The letter stated:
“T am to inform you that the updated Business Plan submitted in October 2015 by the promoter

in respect of the above project has been examined anew and in view of the important implications
thereof, the project has not been approved.”6

Arbitration Agreement

The Claimants invoke the arbitration agreement in Article 9 of the Agreement between the
Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius on the
Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed at Helsinki on 12 September 2007 (the “Finland-

Mauritius BIT”),’ which they say is applicable by virtue of Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT.

Letter from the PMO to the Managing Director of the BOI, dated 14 October 2014 (Exhibit C-7).

tiers.”

 

Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT provides as follows:

“1. Any dispute arising directly from an investment between one Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party should be settled amicably between the two parties to the
dispute.

2. If the dispute has not been settled within three months from the date on which it was raised in
writing, the dispute may, at the choice of the investor, be submitted:

(a) to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made; or

(b) to arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),
established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 (hereinafter
referred to as the “Centre”), if the Centre is available; or

(c) to any ad hoc arbitration tribunal which unless otherwise agreed on by the parties to the
dispute, is to be established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

3. An investor who has submitted the dispute to a national court may nevertheless have recourse
to one of the arbitral tribunals mentioned in paragraphs 2(b) or 2(c) of this Article if, before a
judgment has been delivered on the subject matter by a national court, the investor declares not
to pursue the case any longer through national proceedings and withdraws the case.

4. Any arbitration under this Article shall, at the request of either party to the dispute, be held in
a State that is a party to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards (New York Convention), opened for signature at New York on 10 June 1958. Claims
submitted to arbitration under this Article shall be considered to arise out of a commercial
relationship or transaction for purposes of Article 1 of the New York Convention.”?

France-Mauritius BIT, Article 8(2) (Exhibit C-2). (“With respect to matters governed by this Treaty other than
those referred to in article 7, the investments of nationals, companies or other corporate bodies of one
Contracting State shall also benefit from any more favourable provisions than those in this Treaty which may
result from international undertakings already entered into or hereafter entered into by the other Contracting
State with the first-mentioned Contracting State or with third States.”) (Translation by the PCA).

TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION

Introduction

The Respondent’s challenge to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction turns around two main points: first, the
Respondent argues that it has never consented to arbitration under the Treaty;”° second, according to
the Respondent, there is no qualifying investment in the sense of the Treaty.?” For the avoidance of

doubt, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not dispute the Claimants’ quality as French

nationals and therefore potential investors under the Treaty.”*

The Claimants, to the contrary, argue that they have made a protected investment under the Treaty;””
and that the Respondent’s submission to arbitration results from the combined application of the

most-favoured-nation (“MFN”) clause in Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT and the dispute

resolution clause in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT.*°

The Parties also disagree on the order in which the Tribunal should look at the two questions.

According to the Respondent, the question of consent is the starting point:

“Both of the issues, obviously relate to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but the issue of jurisdiction
ratione voluntatis is the more fundamental one. It is about whether there is a consent to arbitrate
in the first place. In the Respondent’s submission, it is therefore logical to address the issue of
jurisdiction ratione voluntatis first. It is about the existence of the alleged consent, whereas the
existence of investment is about the scope of the alleged consent. If there is no consent, there is
no jurisdiction of any kind at the first place.”*!

 

According to the Claimants, the question of a protected investment is logically a preliminary step
since it concerns the applicability of the Treaty? The Claimants state that the question of the MFN

clause presupposes that the Treaty containing it applies in the first place.**

The Tribunal is of the view that the order of the issues is not decisive. Ultimately, the Claimants will
have to show that both conditions are met, i.e. that they made a protected investment and that the
Respondent consented to arbitration (via the MFN clause or otherwise). This is because each
condition is indispensable with respect to jurisdiction. Nevertheless, conceptually, the question of
the protected investment may be looked at first because it concerns the applicability of the Treaty and

the MEN clause contained therein.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will examine in turn whether the Claimants made a qualifying investment

under the France-Mauritius BIT and, then, whether the Claimants are entitled to invoke the arbitration

Even though the Respondent initially noted that the Claimants had failed to submit any evidence to prove their
French nationality (see Respondent’s Memorial, para. 68), the Respondent confirmed at the Hearing that they
do not dispute the Claimants’ quality as French nationals. See Transcript, 12 June 2019, p. 139.

agreement in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT on the basis of the MFN clause in Article 8(2)

of the France-Mauritius BIT.

Existence of a Qualifying Investment

1. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae because the Claimants
have failed to prove that they made a qualifying investment in Mauritius.** According to the
Respondent, the mere ownership of non-operating companies and pre-investment expenditures fall
outside the definition of investments pursuant to the France-Mauritius BIT.*° The Respondent states
that the Claimants’ Mauritius Laboratory never materialised owing to their failure to obtain the

necessary authorisations from Mauritian authorities.*°

The Respondent contends that the meaning of investment as per Article 1(1) of the France-Mauritius
BIT should be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms in their
context and in light of its object and purpose, to use the familiar language of Article 31(1) of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “WCLT”).*’ The Respondent states that in lieu of
defining investments, Article 1(1) of the France-Mauritius BIT merely provides a list of the forms
that an investment may take. In its relevant part, Article 1(1) provides that “/a]u sens de la présente
Convention, le terme ‘investissements’ comprend toutes les catégories de biens notamment, mais non
exclusivement [...].”** In other words, it sets out a non-exhaustive list of assets that may qualify as

investments.”

According to the Respondent, the relevant test in determining whether investments fall within the

ambit of the Treaty is “not whether they fall within one or more categories of assets listed in

Respondent’s Memorial, para. 68, referring to Article 24 of the UNCITRAL Rules; Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The
Czech Republic, 1CSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, p. 25, para. 61 (“if jurisdiction rests on the
existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage”) (Exhibit RL-29).

Article 1(1), but rather whether they meet the inherent definition of ‘investment’ under the Treaty.”

The Respondent submits that investments listed in the Treaty are “not exhaustive, and do not
constitute an all-encompassing definition of ‘investment’ [and that] there must be a benchmark
against which to assess those non-listed assets or categories of assets in order to determine whether

they constitute an ‘investment.”””*!

Comparing Article 1(1) of the Treaty to the Switzerland-Czech and Slovak Federal Republic BIT,
which according to the Respondent contains a similar asset-based investment definition, the
Respondent argue that the “[...] BIT definition of investment is not an entirely self-standing concept,
but refers to a more general concept given by international law rules.”*? The Respondent draws
support from awards rendered by tribunals acting under the Rules of the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (the “ICSID”) as well as in non-ICSID investment treaty

arbitrations.*

The Respondent submits that an investment must possess the following characteristics to benefit from
investment treaty protection:
“[...] (a) a capital contribution to the host-State by the private contracting party, (b) a significant
duration over which the project is implemented and (c) a sharing of operational risks inherent to
the contribution together with long-term commitments.”*+
The Respondent points to the fact that the Claimants agree to apply those “critéres de qualification
de l'investissement,” known as the “Salini test.”*° The Respondent makes the following submissions

regarding those criteria.
First, regarding the capital contribution criterion, the Respondent argues that the creation of the

Companies is “of no relevance” since they were never capitalised and had no activity.*° According
to the Respondent, the Companies were “mere shells, vehicles for later investments, rather than
investments in themselves.”“’ Moreover, the funds injected in the Companies were soon recovered
by the Claimants “when the Mauritian authorities informed the Claimants that their proposed
investment was not authorised.”“*

The Respondent also argues that the Claimants have failed to prove that they would have invested
know-how.*? According to the Respondent, the Claimants merely refer to planned future
contributions which never happened. In any event, in order to qualify as a contribution, know-how
“would need to amount to something of tangible value, such as intellectual property rights.”°°

The Respondent addresses the Claimants’ argument that a capital of EUR 100,000 per company
would be sufficient to be considered as an investment under the Mauritius Investment Promotion Act
of 2000 (the “Mauritius Investment Promotion Act” or “Act”).°! The Respondent submits that the
Claimants failed to apply the second limb of the requirements under the Act which states that
companies must have an “annual turnover exceeding 4 million rupees.”*?. The Respondent further
submits that “the amount of EUR 100,000 is not a substantial contribution, as required for it to be a
constitutive element of a qualifying investment.”

The Respondent further submits that pre-investment expenses do not have the attributes to constitute

a protected investment under the Treaty as they are not capital contributions, present no risks or

expectation of return, and offer no long-term commitments.™* According to the Respondent, “the
unilateral or internal characterization of certain expenditures by the Claimants in preparation for a
project of investment”>> cannot be accepted as a valid form of investment. The Respondent adds that

any claims pertaining to unestablished investments are premature.*°

The Respondent submits that the Project never materialised because it was subject to relevant
authorisations by Mauritian authorities.*’ The Respondent further submits that the Claimants were
aware of required the amendments to local legislation (such as the DNA Identification Act 2009 (the
“DNA Identification Act”)) which were necessary prior to the establishment of the Project. These

amendments did not take place.*

with the Project.*?

Second, regarding the risk criterion, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have made no capital
contribution and borne no risks. The Respondent states that under “the definition of investment,
‘risk’ refers to the risk of losing the capital contribution made, not the risk of not being able to make

an investment.”*' According to the Respondent:

“The fact of the matters is that as the Claimants made no capital contribution, they risked nothing.
The limited funds transferred into the [C]ompanies’ bank accounts were always under the
Claimants’ control, and recovered when the [C]ompanies were dissolved. In other words, the
Claimants assumed no risk, at any point in time, in relation to their alleged investment.”

   

Third, regarding the duration criterion, the Respondent submits that in the absence of “a capital

contribution, [the Claimants’] alleged investment has, by definition, no duration.”

Finally, according to the Respondent, the Claimants opine that prospective investors should be

 

protected under the Treaty. The Respondent takes

  

ssue with this view, stressing that the protection
should only extend to realised investments.“ With respect to the object and purpose of the Treaty,
the Respondent believes that investments exclude “any form of promotion” and further submits that
“general promotion obligations contained in BITs do not give any enforceable right to the admission
and establishment of prospective foreign investors or require States to adopt specific measures to
promote foreign investment.”®* The Respondent adds that customary international law preserves the
discretion of a State to admit “foreigners and foreign investors in their territories and most countries
refrain from granting foreign nationals an unrestricted right to invest in their economies through
BITs.”® Foreign investors from the other Contracting State are thus not afforded any positive right

of admission.”

In sum, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae because the

Claimants have failed to prove that they have made any protected investment under the Treaty.

2. Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, the Parties first discussed the possibility of setting up the Mauritius
Laboratory in 2009. Since then, the First Claimant, via the French Laboratory, has cooperated with
the judicial authorities of Mauritius in a number of cases involving forensic matters.® Following the
establishment of this relationship, the Claimants sought to grow their activity internationally and, in

2014, formally initiated the steps for the setting up of the Mauritius Laboratory.
According to the Claimants, the events unfolded in the following manner:”

(a) the Project was laid out as a business plan (the “Business Plan”) which described the

investments to be made and was validated by the BOI;”

(b) the Project received an unconditional approval from the PMO in the form of the No-Objection
Letter on 14 October 2014;

(c) _ on this basis, the BOI liaised with the University of Mauritius on 17 December 2014” for the

latter to consider a partnership with the Claimants;”

(d) during the course of 2015, the Claimants set up the Companies intended to operate the different
branches of the Project;’°

(e) the Companies were initially weakly capitalised but various amounts were mobilised by the

and expenses under the Project;”° and

(f) the Project was supported by the BOI,” it benefited from the Fast Track Committee,” a notarial

In light of the above, the Claimants submit that the Project was wrongly terminated by the PMO’s
Rejection Letter of 14 April 2016.5! The Claimants submit that by the time the Rejection Letter was
issued, they had already made protected investments under the Treaty. It is thus the Claimants’
contention that they are not seeking protection for future investments and that the Respondent, in

alleging so, is distorting the Claimants’ submissions.**

The Claimants refer to Article 1(1) of the Treaty which provides that “au sens de la présente

‘és et

 

Convention, le terme ‘investissements’ comprend (...) les droits de participation a des soci

9983,

autres sortes de participation. This, according to the Claimants, is inclusive and unconditional

and it follows that shares in companies are investments within the meaning of the Treaty.™*

However, the Claimants agree that it would be contrary to the purpose of the Treaty if the protection
was granted to any French citizen holding an interest in a company incorporated in Mauritius without

taking into account the three criteria for qualifying the investment: contribution, risk, and duration,

often referred to as the Salini test.*° The Claimants argue that the Treaty is meant to protect nationals
of a Contracting State who intend to invest sustainably in the economy and territory of the other

Contracting State.**

The Claimants submit that the criteria established in the Salini test must “be assessed globally even
if, for the sake of reasoning, the Tribunal considers them individually.”*” The Claimants cite a number
of additional authorities in support of this position** and analyse the distinctive characteristics

required for an investment to qualify under the Treaty as follows.

First, with respect to the contribution criterion, the Claimants submit that in 2015, they transferred an
amount of EUR 100,000 for each of the Companies, i.e. a total amount of EUR 300,000. According
to the Claimants, these three transfers were ordered on 19 May 2015, 25 June 2015 and 28 July 2015°
so that the Companies could claim the status of investor within the meaning of the Mauritius

Investment Promotion Act.”

The Claimants further submit that although the amounts mobilised may seem small, transfers of funds
for the benefit of the Companies were made by the Claimants only when needed to advance the
Project.”! In addition, the Claimants submit that there is no numerical threshold for an investment to

qualify for protection and that smaller investors also have a role to play.°”

In any event, according to the Claimants, in 2015, the investment amount of the Project represented
37% of the profits then realised by the First Claimant and they submit that this shows a considerable

financial effort in terms of the Claimants’ personal resources.”* The Claimants allege that they had

The Claimants also note that the criterion of contribution should not only be assessed in financial
terms, but also in terms of contribution of know-how.®> According to the Claimants, such know-how
goes beyond their personal expertise.°° The Claimants submit that the Project would have
necessitated, inter alia, the purchase of expensive and specialised equipment, a specific internal
layout of the Mauritius Laboratory, as well as hiring qualified teams that respect precise, standardised

and certified sampling, analysis and identification protocols.”

Refuting the Respondent’s arguments, the Claimants submit that the repatriation of the funds cannot
call into question the qualification of these contributions as investments, adding that the repatriation

was sensible in light of the termination of the Project by the PMO.**

As to the Respondent’s allegation regarding the lack of operational activity of the Companies, the
Claimants observe that the Companies entered into negotiations with the University of Mauritius and

had been issued invoices in their names, among other things.”

In response to the Respondent’s allegation that the Claimants ignored the second limb of the Mauritius
Investment Promotion Act which requires “an annual turnover exceeding 4 million rupees,” the
Claimants submit that the anticipated annual turn-over of the Project was significantly higher than

the legal threshold.!°°

different risks. According to the Claimants, the Project’s Business Plan describes a long-term
commercial activity in Mauritius with results that could fluctuate in consideration of numerous
economic, regulatory and political circumstances.'°! The Claimants also point out that they invested
their own funds in the Project, which constitutes an important risk factor. In addition to the identified
technical risks and the mapping of specific risks in the Business Plan, the profitability of the Project

included a risk linked to the market shares of paternity tests.'°” The Claimants add that the termination

 

of the Project alone characterises the political risk taken in carrying out this Project.!°

Third, with respect to the duration criterion, the Claimants submit that their establishment in
Mauritius was effected by the incorporation of the Companies once the Project was authorised by the
No-Objection Letter on 14 October 2014. The Companies were dissolved soon after the Project was

terminated by the Rejection Letter on 14 April 2016.'"

The Claimants further add that the Project was intended to run in the long term. According to the
Claimants, the fact that the Respondent terminated the Project cannot deprive them of the protection
of the Treaty, since the purpose of the Treaty is to provide investors with protection once their Project
is accepted.'°° The Claimants submit that they started to benefit from the protection of the Treaty
from the moment the Project was authorised by the PMO’s No-Objection Letter.!°° The Claimants
submit that from the Project’s approval until its termination, they have, through the Companies,
undertaken many actions in accordance with the BOI’s guidelines.'” The termination of the Project
is not attributable to the Claimants, and their technical and financial capacity to carry out the Project

has never been questioned. According to the Claimants, it would be wrong to determine the duration

Fourth, the Claimants also make reference to a possible additional fourth criterion in the so-called
Salini test: the requirement that the investment contributes to the development of the host State.! In
this respect, the Claimants submit that the Project brought a specific expertise which the Respondent
needed. The Claimants further submit that by including the Project in the Fast Track Committee, the
Respondent acknowledged its importance and potential impact on the Mauritian economy.'!°

Finally, the Claimants submit that none of the awards cited by the Respondent can serve as a relevant
reference to dismiss the qualification of investment in this case, arguing in particular that the cases

cited by the Respondent are distinguishable from the case at hand.!!!

The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s arguments that the Claimants only made pre-investment
expenses which do not qualify as a protected investment under the Treaty. According to the
Claimants, these arguments ignore the unconditional approval of the Project by the PMO of the
Respondent in the form of the No-Objection Letter dated 14 October 2014.!!? The Claimants submit
that their expenses incurred after the aforementioned approval.''? The Claimants argue that the

(...) de l'autre Etat contractant.”''> On this basis, the Claimants infer that all expenses incurred from
the date of approval of the Project on 14 October 2014 and until the termination of the Project on
14 April 2016 are “arbitrable.”!!®

The Claimants also reject the contention that they were required to obtain new authorisations to carry
out the Project, once the Project was approved by the PMO. The Claimants submit it is normal
practice that the implementation of the Project requires additional administrative authorisations and
that the BOI assists the investor in obtaining the relevant permits.''’ In any event, in the Claimants’
view, the termination of the Project was not justified by the need for an amendment of the DNA
Identification Act.!'* The Claimants further submit that the DNA Identification Act has never

prevented the Respondent’s authorities from seeking the Claimants’ services.!!°

In sum, the Claimants consider that their investments, expenses, and the human and financial
resources incurred in the course of preparing for the Project from its approval by the PMO on
14 October 2014 must be considered globally as a protected investment within the meaning of the

France-Mauritius BIT.

3. Tribunal’s Decision

The first question before the Tribunal, in order to establish its jurisdiction, is whether the Claimants
have made an investment within the meaning of the France-Mauritius BIT. The Tribunal will first
set out the relevant legal standard for a protected investment under the Treaty, before assessing

whether the Claimants’ Project meets the relevant standard.

(a) Legal Standard for a Qualifying Investment

110. Asa preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that both sides made submissions relating to the Mauritius.
Investment Promotion Act.!”° In particular, the Parties discussed whether the Claimants meet certain
threshold requirements to qualify as investors under the Act.!2! The Mauritius Investment Promotion
Act, among other things, provides that persons qualifying as investors under the Act may benefit from
support for investment activities, including by the BOI.'?? However, the Mauritius Investment
Promotion Act contains no substantive investment protection provisions and no offer of access to
arbitration. In any event, the application of the Mauritius Investment Promotion Act, and the possible
qualification of the Claimants as investors under the Act, have no bearing on the question before the
Tribunal, i.e. whether the Claimants have made an investment under the France-Mauritius BIT, in

order to determine whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction thereunder.

111. The relevant starting point for the Tribunal’s determination on whether the Claimants have made a

qualifying investment is Article 1(1) of the France-Mauritius BIT. It provides as follows:

“Au sens de la présente C le terme ‘i toutes les catégories de

biens notamment, mais non exclusivement:

- les biens meubles et immeubles ainsi que tous autres droits réels tels qu’hypothéques, droits
de gage, etc., acquis ou constitués en conformité avec la législation du pays ot se trouve
l'investissement;

- les droits de participation a des sociétés et autres sortes de participation;

- les droits de propriété industrielle, brevets d’invention, marques de fabrique ou de
commerce, ainsi que les éléments incorporels de fonds de commerce;

  

- les concessions d’entreprises accordées par la puissance publique et notamment les
concessions de recherches et d'exploitation de substances minérales;

- toutes créances afférentes aux biens et droits ci-dessus visés et aux prestations qui s'y
rapportent.”!3

- movable and immovable property and all other real rights such as mortgages, liens, etc, which have been
acquired or constituted in accordance with the legislation of the country in which the investment takes place;

- rights of participation in companies and participation of other kinds;

PCA Case No. 2018-37

In interpreting Article 1(1), the Tribunal takes into account “the ordinary meaning to be given to the
terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose,” according to

Article 31(1) of the VCLT.'*4

Article 1(1) provides that investments within the meaning of the Treaty encompass all categories of
assets. It also contains a non-exhaustive list of assets. The ordinary meaning of the terms of the
provision (“notamment, mais non exclusivement”) leaves no doubt about the non-exhaustive nature

of the list in Article 1(1). The Parties indeed agree on this point.'?5

The question remains whether any assets that fall within the non-exhaustive list of Article 1(1)
automatically qualify as an investment within the meaning of the Treaty or whether, to the contrary,

the assets also need to meet an objective, intrinsic definition of investment.

As detailed above,'”° the Respondent submits that the France-Mauritius BIT does not contain a
substantive definition of protected investments and that Article 1(1) merely lists possible forms that
investments may take.'2” The relevant test, according to the Respondent, is therefore not whether
assets fall in a category of the list in Article 1(1), but rather whether they meet an inherent definition

of investment under the Treaty.!”*

As also detailed above,'”’ the Claimants agree that assets falling within Article 1(1) also need to meet
an independent test for investments.'* According to the Claimants, this is so because the Treaty is
only “meant to protect the nationals of a State who intend to invest sustainably in the economy and

territory of the other Contracting State.”!*!

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

The Tribunal is satisfied that this interpretation of Article 1(1) of the Treaty is correct. Looking at
the plain wording of Article 1(1), it does not contain a definition of investments. Indeed, the term
“definition” does not even appear in Article 1(1). Rather, Article 1(1) only provides that the term
“investments” — however to be defined — encompasses (“comprend”) all types of assets (“toutes les
catégories de biens”). Such a provision cannot play the gatekeeping role of establishing when a
situation qualifies as an investment and when it does not. Nor can the non-exhaustive list of assets
contained in Article 1(1) play such a role since, by its own terms, it only provides possible examples.
The question of how to define investment therefore cannot be found in Article 1(1) of the Treaty. It
has to be found in the objective and ordinary meaning of the term “investments.” The Tribunal notes
that other arbitral tribunals, applying similar investment treaty provisions, have reached the same
result. For instance, in Romak S.A. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan, the tribunal concluded that:

“The term ‘investments’ has an intrinsic meaning, independent of the categories enumerated in

Article 1(2). This meaning cannot be ignored.”"®
The Tribunal therefore needs to determine the objective meaning of “investment” that will operate as
a benchmark definition for the purposes of Article 1(1) of the Treaty. The Parties agree on this point
to apply what they call the Salini test, i.e. in order to show a protected investment the Claimants need

133,

to show it meets certain criteria.'** These criteria include (i) a contribution to the host State; (ii) of a

certain duration; (iii) that entails participating in the risks of the operation. These criteria, in slight

variations, have been developed by arbitral tribunals — operating under the ICSID convention'™ as

well as bilateral investment treaties'* — and scholarly writing.'*°

The Parties have debated the application of a fourth criterion, i.e. whether the invested assets
contribute to the development (or the economy) of the host State.'57 Arbitral tribunals seem split as
to whether such a fourth criterion is necessary, its assessment having been criticised as too subjective

8

by some.'** However, the Tribunal need not decide this point, since, as will be seen below, the

Claimants’ Project in the case at hand does not meet the initial three criteria.

In any event, the Tribunal is minded to apply the above-listed criteria with some flexibility.'"° This
should not be a box-ticking exercise, but take into account the full circumstances of each case. For
instance, if the duration of a project is rather short, but entails substantial risks, the test might be

satisfied.

(b) Application of the Legal Standard to the Claimants’ Project

As a preliminary remark, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants had planned a number of investment
activities in Mauritius with the aim of setting up the Mauritius Laboratory. These activities are set

out in the Business Plan and include, among other things, the purchase of land, the construction of

infrastructure, the purchase of equipment, and the hiring and training of employees.'*°

These activities may well have involved elements of the categories listed in Article 1(1) of the Treaty,
in particular “Jes droits de participation a des sociétés et autres sortes de participation;” “les droits
de propriété industrielle, brevets d’invention, marques de fabrique ou de commerce, ainsi que les
éléments incorporels de fonds de commerce,” and “toutes créances afférentes aux biens et droits ci-
dessus visés et aux prestations qui s’y rapportent.”'

The question remains whether these activities meet the three criteria of the legal test set out above,
i.e. (i) a contribution to the host State; (ii) of a certain duration; (iii) that entails participating in the
risks of the operation.'*4 The Tribunal will look at each criterion in turn, while keeping in mind the
flexibility of the test set out above.'*> For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will also address

some additional arguments made by the Parties.

i Contribution to the Host State

Contributions to the host State can take several forms, not only financial. As the tribunal in Deutsche
Bank AG v. Sri Lanka put it, “[a] contribution can take any form [and] [...] is not limited to financial
terms but also includes know-how, equipment, personnel and services.”'° Article 1(1) of the Treaty

lists several non-financial assets, such as intellectual property rights. Yet, the listing of non-financial

The Claimants signed a “promesse de vente” which provided them with an option for the purchase of land (see
agreement to sell lots 17 and 18 between Business Parks and DNA Services, dated August 2015 (Exhibit
C-16)). However, this purchase of land never materialised, being contingent upon the issuance of
“l'autorisation d’achat d'un terrain,” which according to the Respondent, the Claimants did not obtain (see
Respondent’s Memorial, para. 93; Respondent’s Reply, para. 105(i)).

assets as possible forms of investments does not dispense them from the requirement that they
embody the inherent characteristics of investments. Thus non-financial inputs may satisfy the test,
but only as long as they have an economic value that can be contributed. In LESI, S.p.A. and Astaldi,
S.p.A. v. People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, the tribunal stated that contributions could
“consist of loans, materials, works, services, as long as they have an economic value,” adding that
the claimant “must have committed some expenditure, in whatever form, in order to pursue an
economic objective.”!*” Indeed, the Respondent does not dispute the point that a contribution need

not take the form of a financial asset, provided that it has an economic value.'“*

The Parties have discussed whether there is a requirement for the contribution to be “considerable,”
“substantial” or of a certain minimum size.'*° Certain arbitral tribunals and scholarly writings have

t.'°° The assessment of what constitutes considerable or

argued in favour of such a requirement
substantial is difficult due to the subjective character of such qualifications. On the one hand, a
contribution of EUR | seems insufficient to qualify as an investment. On the other hand, a fixed
numerical threshold seems arbitrary. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that a numerical
threshold could exclude smaller investors from the protection under the Treaty.'*! Therefore, in the
view of the Tribunal, the reality of the contribution is to be assessed taking into account the totality

of the circumstances and the elements of the economic goal pursued.

The Tribunal will look at the Claimants’ alleged two contributions in turn: the transfer of funds and

the contribution of know-how.

- Transfer of Funds

As detailed above, the Claimants incorporated the Companies on 9 January 2015, 23 February 2015
and 24 September 2015, respectively.'°? The Claimants jointly control the Holding Company, which

in turn controls the other two of the Companies.'**

The First Claimant transferred EUR 100,000 on 20 May 2015, 25 June 2015 and 29 July 2015 (i.e.
EUR 300,000 in total) to the bank account of the Holding Company." On 7 July 2015, EUR 70,000
thereof were transferred from the bank account of the Holding Company to another of the Companies,

DNA Services Mauritius Ltd.'**

The transfer of funds was made by the First Claimant only, as stated on the bank statements.'*° This

has also been confirmed by the Claimants at the Hearing:

“THE PRESIDENT: We also asked this morning some questions about the payment that was
made at several moments in time to those three [C]ompanies, to the bank accounts of those
[C]ompanies, at least. And I believe the relevant exhibit here, at least one of them, is C-13, which
is the bank statement.

My understanding is that that bank statement is a bank statement of the [HJolding [C]ompany,
and that it is three pages of different moments in time; the first is the bank statement of May
2015, the second is June 2015, and the third page is July 2015. And what we do see is three
transfers of money of 100,000 euros each that are credited to this account. So this is a transfer to
the [Holding [C]ompany of 300,000 euros made in three different transfers.

I also see that the transfer has been made by Christian Doutremepuich, all three of those
payments. At least that’s how I read the bank statement. Is that correct that the 300,000 have
come under this bank statement from Professor Christian Doutremepuich?

ME. POULAIN: Madame la présidente, oui, je pense que c'est absolument correct. Ce qu’il
conviendrait de préciser... parce que M. Christian Doutremepuich, avant que la société.
société, qui aujourd'hui exploite le laboratoire bordelais, soit constituée, c’est-d-dire l'enti
corporate, exergait avant en BNC. Done, je ne sais pas si les fonds qui sont arrivés de
M. Christian Doutremepuich sont de M. Christian Doutremepuich, és qualités, profession
libérale, ou personnels. Done, c’est un point quand méme a regarder, qui peut avoir une certaine
importance, et on confirmera le sujet, on le clarifiera.

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

THE PRESIDENT: I think my question actually related to the fact that they would not come from
the [S]econd Claimant in this arbitration, Antoine Doutremepuich.

ME. POULAIN: Absolument, vous avez raison. Oui.”'*”

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Second Claimant did not make any financial

contribution.

Concerning the First Claimant, the question remains whether that transfer of funds constitutes a
financial contribution. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal does not consider that the transfer
of “only” EUR 300,000 automatically categorises it as being too small for a financial contribution

constitutive of an investment.'°*

However, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the funds were contributed in the first place. The First
Claimant merely transferred the monies from one bank account he controlled (in France) to other
bank accounts he controlled via the Holding Company (in Mauritius). As set out above, the monies
were transferred to the bank account of (i) the Holding Company which is jointly controlled by the
Claimants (90% by the First Claimant); and (ii) DNA Services Mauritius Ltd, itself controlled by the
Holding Company. The monies deposited in those bank accounts were no more a financial
contribution in Mauritius than they had been in the original bank account in France. The First

Claimant was never dispossessed of the monies, nor did he contribute them in any other way.

Questioned at the Hearing about this point, the Claimants argued that the funds were “immobilized”

and therefore could not be used for other purposes.'*° The Tribunal is unconvinced by this argument.

Transcript, 12 June 2019, pp. 147-149.

(“ME. POULAIN: Madam President, yes, I think it’s absolutely correct. What should be clarified ... because
Mr. Christian Doutremepuich, before the company ... his company, which today operates the Bordeaux

commercial profits. So, I do not know whether the funds that came from Mr. Christian Doutremepuich are
from Mr. Christian Doutremepuich, in his professional capacity, or personal. So, it’s still a point to look at,
which may be of some importance, and we will confirm the subject, we will clarify it.

The Claimants never lost control over the use of the monies in the bank account. They could spend
them, repatriate them or transfer them elsewhere at any time as they wished. In fact, the Claimants
themselves explained that they kept full control over the funds during the whole period and could

take them back at any time:

“PROF. CAPRASSE: Puisque vous parlez de fonds versés, vous parlez des sociétés, peut-étre
est-ce a un autre moment que vous pourrez répondre, mais, si vous pouvez le faire maintenant:
quel est le statut de ces 300 000 euros que vous évoqu[ez]?. C'est de l’argent qui est mis sur un
compte de la société? C’est de l’argent qui est nécessaire pour acquérir des actions? C’est de
Vargent qui est constitutif du capital de la société? Faire une société a l'ile Maurice nécessite-
t-il un capital minimum? Vous voyez, la question que je pose est celle, sur cet aspect particulier
que vous évoquez des 300 000 euros, de leur statut, en fait.

 

 

 

ME. REGAUD: Bien sir. Les fonds ont bien évidemment été versés sur les comptes des sociétés,
tout d’abord sur le compte de la holding puis aprés reversés & une autre entité créée par les
demandeurs, et donc étaient nécessaires pour assurer le fonctionnement des sociétés et puis les
différents investissements, c’est-a-dire que la promesse, par exemple, de vente nécessitait une
mise sous séquestre de 10 % du prix de vente du terrain et donc, il fallait bien que les sociétés
puissent s ‘acquitter des dépenses relatives, par exemple, a cette demande de séquestre, ou encore
a d’autres factures au quotidien, que ce soit sur, par exemple, le suivi juridique des sociétés par
la société ABAX. Cette somme n'a pas été mise au capital des sociétés. C’était nécessaire au
fonctionnement des sociétés, c'est pour cela qu’elles ont été transférées sur les comptes a
Maurice. {...]

ME. POULAIN: Oui, je l'assimile a un compte courant d’associés. C'est une créance contre la
société.
PROF. PAULSSON: Qui est exigible?

ME. POULAIN: A tout moment. A condition de la demander. Et d’avoir l'accord des
actionnaires.”'®

n'enléve pas et ne permet pas de réduire a néant le fait que ces fonds ont été mobilisés et versés a un moment
donné et pendant une longue durée afin d’assurer la mise en place du laboratoire. THE PRESIDENT: Et juste
pour clarifier, quand vous dites ‘ces fonds’, vous vous référez aux 300 000 euros qui ont été transférés au
compte de la holding? ME REGAUD: Bien évidemment.”)

(“ME REGAUD: It should be remembered that this was done with the Claimants’ own funds, these funds were
immobilized for a period of nineteen months, they were actually paid to the companies, partly spent. They
could not have been used for other purposes and the fact that they were repatriated in part, as has been
mentioned, does not negate the fact that these funds were mobilized and paid at a given moment and for a long
time to ensure the establishment of the laboratory. THE PRESIDENT: And just to clarify, when you say ‘these
funds’, you refer to the 300 000 euros which have been transferred to the account of the holding? ME REGAUD:
Of course.”) (Translation by the PCA).

Transcript, 12 June 2019, pp. 91-92 (emphasis added). (“PROF. CAPRASSE: Since you're talking about funds
disbursed, you’re talking about companies, maybe you can answer it at later stage, but if you can do it now:
what is the status of the 300,000 euros that you mentioned? Is it money that was put on the company account?
Is it money that is needed to acquire shares? Does that money represent the capital of the company? Does
incorporating a company in Mauritius require a minimum capital? You see, in fact the question I’m asking,
with reference to the 300,000 euros that you mentioned, is their status.

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

Indeed, on 13 May 2016, shortly after the Rejection Letter and the winding down of the Companies,
the First Claimant repatriated a large part of the initial funds (i.e. EUR 223,473) back to his bank
account in France.'®! This shows that the Claimants never lost control over the monies, which they
had never immobilized and never committed to any economic objective in Mauritius. In those
circumstances, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the transfer of funds by the First Claimant qualifies

as a financial contribution constitutive of an investment.

Although the Claimants did not necessarily argue this point, the Tribunal will also consider whether
the Claimants made financial contributions by spending parts of the transferred funds in Mauritius.
Of the EUR 300,000 transferred, it appears that the Claimants spent some EUR 76,000. This results
from the delta between the amount transferred to Mauritius in 2015 (EUR 300,000) and the one
transferred back to France in 2016 at the closing of the Holding Company’s bank account
(EUR 223,473).' It appears that those monies were used, at least partially, to pay bills such as for

setting up the Companies, internet designs, architectural plans etc.'

If the Tribunal is satisfied that those expenses may as a matter of their nature qualify as financial

ME. REGAUD: Of course. The funds were paid into the accounts of the companies, first of all in the account
of the holding company and then transferred to another entity created by the Claimants, and thus were necessary
to ensure the running of the companies and for the needs of different investments that is, the undertaking, for
example, to sell required to place 10% of the sale price of the land in escrow, and therefore the companies had
to be able to pay the expenses related to, for example, this request for escrow, or to other daily invoices, such
as, the companies’ day-to-day legal monitoring by the company ABAX. This sum was not invested in the
capital of the companies. It was necessary for the functioning of the companies, that’s why they were
transferred to the accounts in Mauritius. [...]

PROF. PAULSSON: What is it exactly? Advance? Shareholders’ advance?
MR. POULAIN: Yes, I equate it with a shareholders’ current account. It is a claim against the company.
PROF. PAULSSON: Which is payable?

MR. POULAIN: At any time. Provided that you ask for it. And that you have the shareholders’ agreement.”)

contributions, they do not meet the required test for investments under the duration and risk criteria.
As detailed in the relevant sections below, they were one-off outlays at the Claimants’ initiative, made
as part of the process of prospecting an investment and as such generating no entitlement of duration

or stake in a venture undertaken on an at-risk basis.'®

- Know-How

The Claimants further submit that they contributed know-how, in the form of the Claimants’ personal
expertise, including for instance with respect to the layout of the Mauritius Laboratory, the purchase

of expensive and specialised equipment, and the hiring and training of qualified personnel.'°

While such contribution of know-how might have been envisaged, the Claimants have failed to
provide evidence of any actual transfer or contribution of know-how of economic value. At the
Hearing, the Claimants alleged that they contributed know-how by communicating to the BOI
architectural plans of the internal layout of the Mauritius Laboratory.’ Even assuming that such a
communication did occur, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have failed to provide evidence
of a transfer of know-how of economic value. On the Claimants’ own case, the internal layout of the
Mauritius Laboratory was only one of the elements needed for the transfer of the know-how required

for the activities of the Mauritius Laboratory.'”

It appears that none of the other elements went
beyond the planning stage on the Claimants’ side and thus never materialised. For instance, at the
Hearing, the Claimants themselves referred to a possible training and transfer of know-how to
qualified personnel as merely being contemplated for the future:
“On a quand méme signé un MoU avec l'université pour avoir le personnel qualifié et leur
transmettre notre savoir-faire. Ils étaient censés venir a Bordeaux pour étre formés
directement.”'®
In light of this, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Claimants made any contribution of know-how

constitutive of an investment.

ti. Duration

In order to meet the relevant test, any contribution to the host State must also be of a certain duration.
There is a rather sterile debate as to how long is enough to meet the duration requirement. It has been
posited as generally accepted that the required duration would be a period of at least two years.!©
However, the application of this requirement should not be excessively rigorous and the relevant
duration is to be assessed in all the circumstances.'” This criterion excludes “short-term economic
activity, or assets used in that context, such as one-time sales transactions that do not face investment-
specific risk.”!7!

As detailed above, the Claimants argue that they established themselves in Mauritius by the
incorporation of the Companies once the Project was authorised by the No-Objection Letter on
14 October 2014 and until the Rejection Letter on 14 April 2016.'” To the contrary, as also detailed
above, the Respondent submits that since the Claimants failed to make a capital contribution, their

alleged investment has, by definition, no duration.'”

The Tribunal is of the view that there can be no fixed minimum duration requirement. Rather, the
duration has to be assessed in light of all the circumstances of the situation as a whole. In the present
case, it is clear, however that there is no duration at all. The financial contributions by the First
Claimant, in the form of payments of bills and invoices in Mauritius, were one-off payments for goods
or services that were incurred as part of the preparations for a project which was not yet off the ground,

and thus did not correspond to commitments of discernible duration.

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that even if the transfer of EUR 300,000 had been
considered a financial contribution (which in the Tribunal’s view was not the case'™), the time during
which the monies were deposited on the Companies’ bank accounts was short. The time between the
transfers of the funds by the First Claimant (in May, June, and July 2015) and the repatriation of the
funds (in May 2016) ranges from 9 months (counting from the last transfer) to 11 months (counting
from the first transfer). In the view of the Tribunal, such a duration does not in and of itself disqualify
a contribution as investment under the global assessment of the criteria under the legal test set out
above.!”> Nevertheless, a project of this kind — which involved introducing enhanced technology —
would take a much more time to assimilate in a new environment and therefore the duration of 9-11

months is unlikely to qualify as an investment under the present circumstances.

ti. Risk

The third criterion under the test set out above is that the contribution entails participating in the risks
of the operation. The risks must be inherent in the contribution. The required element of risk is to
be distinguished from “the ordinary commercial or business risk assumed by all those who enter into
acontractual relationship.”!”° The type of risk normally associated with an investment was elaborated
in Romak S.A. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan as follows:

“All economic activity entails a certain degree of risk. As such, all contracts — including contracts

that do not constitute an investment — carry the risk of non-performance. However, this kind of

risk is pure commercial, counterparty risk, or, otherwise stated, the risk of doing business

generally. It is therefore not an element that is useful for the purpose of distinguishing between
an investment and a commercial transaction.

 

An ‘investment risk’ entails a different kind of alea, a situation in which the investor cannot be
sure of a return on his investment, and may not know the amount he will end up spending, even
if all relevant counterparties discharge their contractual obligations. Where there is ‘risk’ of this
sort, the investor simply cannot predict the outcome of the transaction.”!7”

As detailed above, the Claimants submit that the Project entailed different risks. The Claimants refer
to the commercial risks of the Project described in the Business Plan, i.e. the commercial activity and
profitability of the Mauritius Laboratory could fluctuate as a result of the economic, regulatory and
political circumstances.'*> The Claimants also refer to technical risks in carrying out the operations

of the Mauritius Laboratory.'”

However, these risks relate to the planned future activity of the Mauritius Laboratory which never
came into fruition. The Claimants have failed to point to any risk related to their (alleged)
contribution. First, relating to the payment of certain bills and invoices in Mauritius, it is clear that

these one-off payments entailed no risk; the Claimants merely received goods or services for which

  

they paid. Second, relating to the transfer of funds (even though the Tribunal considers that this

 

Ss
not a financial contribution for the reasons set out above!**), there is no risk related to such transfer.
As explained above, the Claimants always remained in control over the funds and could (and indeed

did) transfer and repatriate them when they wished.'*!

In sum, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ Project does not meet the

requirements of the legal test for a protected investment under the Treaty.

iv.  Pre-Investment Expenditures

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal addresses submissions made by the Parties regarding pre-
investment expenditures. The Parties discussed, with reference to Mihaly International Corporation
v. Sri Lanka, whether the Claimants’ activities are pre-investment expenditures.'*” In particular, the
Parties discussed whether the No-Objection letter of 14 October 2014 qualifies as an approval of the
investment, or whether, to the contrary, the Claimants were aware that further approvals (including

changes to the DNA Identification Act) were needed for the Project to proceed.!**

The Tribunal does not need to decide these points since the possible approval of the Project in the
form of the No-Objection letter is irrelevant in the present context. Even assuming such approval of
the Project occurred, the Claimants still need to show that, following the approval, they made an
investment according to the terms of the Treaty. Indeed, the approval of a project by the host State
does not create an investment out of thin air; rather, the reality of any investment is still to be proven
by the investor. As detailed in the previous sections, the Claimants failed to show they made any

such investment.

v. Planned Future Investments

As detailed above, the Claimants make several references to their planned future investments. In
particular the Claimants argue that they would have made financial and other contributions over a
long time period had it not been for the termination of the Project by the Respondent.'* In this
context, the Claimants rely on the findings of the tribunal in LESI, S.p.A. and Astaldi, S.p.A. v.
People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria which found that for the purpose of the assessment of the
duration of the contribution, the tribunal must look at what was contractually agreed, irrespective of
a premature termination of the project.'** The Claimants also refer to Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The
Czech Republic, in which the tribunal held that “an investment that had come to a standstill, because
of the host State’s action, would still qualify as an investment” because “otherwise the international
protection of foreign investment provided by the BITs would be emptied of its purpose.”!*°
According to the Claimants, the Tribunal therefore should take into account their planned future
investment which would have occurred, had it not been for the Respondent’s termination of the

Project.

The Tribunal is unpersuaded. The role of the Tribunal is not to second-guess what possible future
investments the Claimants might have made. Rather, the Tribunal is to determine whether or not at
the time of the termination of the Project an investment had occurred that qualifies as such under the

Treaty. As detailed above, no such investment occurred.

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

The present case is distinguishable from the cases referred to by the Claimants. In LESI, S.p.A. and
Astaldi, S.p.A. v. People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, the investor had signed a contract for the
construction of a dam with the host State which foresaw a certain contractual duration of the
project.'*” In this context, the tribunal found that in case of an early termination of the contract, the
duration in question was the one contractually foreseen. In the present case, the Claimants and the
Respondent did not enter into a contract with a contractually foreseen timeframe which could have
been taken into account for the duration criterion. In Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic, the
tribunal expressed the view that the project’s unprofitability due to a stand-still imposed by the host
State would not have disqualified the operation as an investment.'** In the present case, the economic
prospects of the Claimants’ Project are not at issue. The Project never materialised to a sufficient
degree to constitute an investment of any duration at all, irrespective of its conceivable economic

soundness as a prospective project.

Finally, the Claimants also refer to Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT which provides that
“Ta]greements concerning investments to be made in the territory of one Contracting State made by
nationals, companies or other corporate bodies of the other Contracting State shall contain” an
arbitration agreement.'*” The Claimants may be suggesting (although this is not explicit) an inference
from the expression “investments to be made” (“investissements a effectuer”) to the effect that the
Tribunal should expand the definition of “investment” to encompass planned future investments.!°°
For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal would also disagree with that proposition. Article 9 of the
Treaty deals with investment contracts between an investor and a host State and provides that such
contracts should include an arbitration agreement. These contracts perforce concern future
investments, i.e. investments not yet made at the time when the parties enter into the investment
contract. Article 9 does not imply in any way that future investments will automatically be covered

by the Treaty for the purpose of establishing a tribunal’s jurisdiction.

In sum, for the reasons detailed above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not made an

investment within the meaning of the France-Mauritius BIT. This is sufficient to decline the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the present case. The Tribunal will however also address the second issue
(i.e. whether the Claimants can invoke the arbitration clause in the Finland-Mauritius BIT on the basis
of the MEN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT), and this for the following reason. As pointed out
above, both issues presented by the Parties are equally dispositive for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. '*!
Therefore, if the Tribunal were wrong on the first issue and the Claimants had made a protected
investment, the Claimants nevertheless could not establish arbitral jurisdiction unless their MFN

contention is valid.

1. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s starting point is that the State’s consent to arbitrate must be clear and
unequivocal.'”? It maintains that “[nJon consent is the default rule; consent is the exception.”!°7_ A

State’s consent to submit a dispute to international arbitration “must be certain”!™* and expressed “in

a ‘voluntary and indisputable’ manner. It further must be proven and cannot be assumed or

inferred.'°° The burden of proof falls on a given claimant who invokes consent against a given

respondent.'°’ The Respondent highlights the strict standard of proof required and concludes that the

Claimants failed to meet the required standard.'°*

Second, the Respondent submits that there is no investor-State arbitration clause, or consent to
arbitrate, in the France-Mauritius BIT.'” It contains an arbitration clause for State-to-State disputes

in Article 10 but no investor-State arbitration clause.”

Regarding investor-State arbitration, its
Article 9, according to the Respondent, does not express consent to arbitrate but merely that any
investment contract between a national of a Contracting State and the other Contracting State should

201

contain an arbitration clause.*' The Respondent thus argues that Article 9 does not represent an

“obligation on the State to arbitrate any future investment disputes with any investor” except if it
202

decides to enter into an investment contract.*”* According to the Respondent, its contractual freedom

whether or not to enter into an investment contract containing an arbitration agreement is unrestricted
and, in the case at hand, no such contract has been signed between the Parties.?°°

According to the Respondent, the lack of consent to investor-State arbitration was also noted when
France and the Republic of Mauritius negotiated and, on 8 March 2010, signed a new treaty (the
“2010 Treaty”) aimed at replacing the France-Mauritius BIT from 1973. The 2010 Treaty, which
has never entered into force, contains an arbitration clause for investor-State disputes. The
Respondent submits that the draft bill by the French government for the 2010 Treaty confirms that

the Contracting States had not given consent to arbitrate in the 1973 Treaty.?”

Third, the Respondent argues that the MFN clause in the France-Mauritius BIT cannot create consent

to arbitrate and that the Claimants thus have no standing to invoke the Treaty.? The Respondent
submits that the Claimants can invoke a right to more favourable treatment through the MEN clause
only after having established the Respondent’s consent to arbitrate from the basic treaty (i.e. an
investment treaty entered into by the investor claimant’s home country, containing an MEN clause
relied upon by the claimant to import into that treaty a provision of another treaty to which its home
country is not a party (the “Basic Treaty”)), here: the France-Mauritius BIT. According to the
Respondent there “is a well-established principle of international law that, to be able to rely on an
MEN clause in the [B]asic [T]reaty, a party must first establish the tribunal’s jurisdiction under that
treaty.”"” In other words, the dispute resolution provision contained in the Finland-Mauritius BIT

remains “independent of and isolated from the [B]asic [T]reaty” and therefore “cannot produce any

legal effect as between [the Claimants and Mauritius]: it is res inter alios acta.”?*

The Respondent seeks support from the final report of the International Law Commission (“ILC”)

209

study group on the most-favoured-nation clause (the “ILC 2015 Report”), as well as scholarly

writing.7!° The Respondent further refers to arbitral decisions which it says confirm that an MFN

clause cannot create a right to go to arbitration where none otherwise exists under the Basic Treaty.”!!

On this basis, the Respondent concludes that it never consented to arbitration under the France-
Mauritius BIT, and the Claimants have no standing to import such consent from the Finland-Mauritius

BIT through the MEN clause of the France-Mauritius BIT.2!”

Fourth, the Respondent argues that, in any event, the MFN clause of the France-Mauritius BIT does

not extend to dispute resolution and therefore the Claimants cannot invoke it.?'*

According to the
Respondent, the language of the MEN clause in Article 8(2) of the Treaty makes it clear that it does
not apply to consent to treaty-based investor-State dispute resolution.” In interpreting Article 8(2)
of the Treaty, the Respondent refers to rules of interpretation in Article 31(1) VCLT and other rules

of international law, such as the rules of severability, ejusdem generis and effet utile.

- Article 31(1) VCLT

The Respondent submits that the language of the MFN clause is the starting point for its interpretation
under Article 31 of the VCLT.2!> Article 31 requires “neither a broad nor a restrictive approach to
interpretation” (i.e. every “ambiguity, or alleged ambiguity, found in [...] treaties should be resolved

in favour of the investor”) but a more “balanced interpretation” should be adopted.7'®

Applying the VCLT standard to the interpretation of the wordings of Article 8(2) of the France-
Mauritius BIT, the Respondent observes that the MFN treatment obligation is limited to “les matiéres

sei, 4 «2
régies par la présente Convention.”?'"

The Respondent submits that because investor-State
arbitration is not a subject matter of the France-Mauritius BIT, it falls outside the scope of the MFN.

clause. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT

deals with dispute resolution as a “matiére” which it governs.?'*

According to the Respondent,
Article 9 creates a right for either of the Contracting States (Mauritius or France), or for their nationals
when dealing with the other Contracting State, to insist upon the inclusion of an ICSID arbitration
clause once there has been agreement to an investment contract. That clause would then establish the

219

parties’ consent to arbitrate. In the hypothetical scenario where an investment contract was

concluded, it “would merely be consent to contractual arbitration, not to treaty arbitration, which is

220

an entirely different issue.

Furthermore, the Respondent rejects the notion that the Claimants can rely on the MFN clause merely

21

because investor-State arbitration is not specifically excluded from its scope.*! According to the
Respondent, in 1973 investor-State arbitration was not the norm and it cannot be held liable for its
failure to consider it at the time.?”? The Respondent submits that the onus is on the Claimants to
establish that consent to investor-State arbitration is within the scope of the MFN clause without
simply arguing that it is not excluded.”*

The Respondent further submits that Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT provides MFN
treatment for “Jes investissements des ressortissants [...] de l’un des Etats contractants,” which,
according to the Respondent’s interpretation, means that the MFN treatment only extends to
investments, but not to investors.?*4 The Respondent adds that the right to access dispute resolution

is not an accessory to the investment, but rather a personal right which allows investors to defend

their investments, and that therefore the MFN clause does not apply to dispute resolution.?”>

- Severability Rule

The Respondent submits that arbitration agreements are severable or autonomous from the main
agreement and therefore “fall[] outside the scope of application of an MEN clause contained in the
same treaty unless the terms of the MFN clause make it clear that it is also intended to govern dispute
resolution.””?° According to the Respondent, many investment treaty tribunals have held that MFN
clauses do not apply to dispute resolution in the first place and therefore cannot be relied upon to

import more favourable dispute resolution provisions from other treaties.”

Refuting the Claimants’ reliance on Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain, the
Respondent submits that “there is another line of cases which has heavily criticised [Maffezini] and
concluded that, in the absence of clear language to the contrary, MFN clauses cannot be applied to

procedural provisions [...].””’* In any event, Maffezini, and other cases that followed it, deal with the
question whether to import a more favourable dispute resolution provision from another treaty and
not whether to import a respondent State’s consent through the operation of an MFN clause, as is the

more specifically in the interpretation of MFN clauses.”*!

The Respondent submits that the rule
supports its interpretation of Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT inasmuch as it is meant “to
eliminate the risk that, through an imprudent application of an MEN clause, parties to international
treaties are considered to be bound by provisions to which they never intended to consent [...].”?*?

The Respondent submits that the application of the ejusdem generis rule translates into a non-
entitlement to import more favourable provisions from the Finland-Mauritius BIT, except where the
subject matter of such provisions is also regulated in the France-Mauritius BIT. According to the
Respondent, investor-State dispute resolution is not regulated in the France-Mauritius BIT and
therefore the Claimants are barred from relying on the MEN clause to import provisions relating to

this subject matter.?** The Respondent also refer to commentators allegedly supporting its position.2*

- Effet Utile Rule

In response to the Claimants’ reference to the effer utile rule, Respondent submits that it cannot be
used “to justify an illegitimate extension of meaning” and “certainly cannot be applied so as to create

2. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants’ interpretation of Articles 8(2) and 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT is that investor-State
dispute settlement falls within the purview of the Treaty, and the Claimants can thus benefit from
Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT via the MFN clause in Article 8(2) to settle their dispute with
the Respondent through arbitration?” The Claimants observe that the same issue had already been
put to the arbitral tribunal in Dawood Rawat v. The Republic of Mauritius, but it was not decided
there because the tribunal dismissed jurisdiction on a different basis.”** The Claimants stress the
novelty of the question before the Tribunal, on which no other tribunal has so far opined.?”
The Claimants submit that there is a consensus today that MFN clauses, in general, may apply to
dispute resolution provisions.” According to the Claimants, given the wide variety of MFN clauses,
the determination of the scope of each of these MFN clauses requires a case-by-case interpretation.”*!
The Claimants refer in particular to the ILC 2015 Report which states inter alia that:

“cette question est vraiment une question d'interprétation des traités a laquelle il ne peut étre

répondu qu’au regard de chaque cas particulier”

“il ne fait aucun doute que les dispositions NPF en matiére d’investissement sont largement
présentes dans les accords bilatéraux d’investissement, mais avec un libellé propre @ chaque
accord”

 

“la question clé de l'ejusdem generis [...] doit étre déterminée au cas par cas.”

special attention must thus be paid to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty. The
Claimants therefore proceed to an analysis of the wording of the MEN clause in Article 8(2) of the
Treaty and submit that it is drafted in the broadest possible manner.*“4 The Claimants break down

Article 8(2) in the following manner.

 

- “Pour les matiéres régies par la présente Ce ion autres que celles visées a

article 7°

 

According to the Claimants, the introductory sentence of Article 8(2) of the Treaty raises two
interpretation issues. The first is whether investor-State dispute settlement is one of the “matiéres”
governed by the Treaty and, if so, the second is whether investor-State dispute settlement is excluded

from the operation of the clause by virtue of Article 7 of the Treaty.

Regarding the first point, the Claimants submit that investor-State dispute settlement is one of the
subject matters (““matiéres”) of the France-Mauritius BIT pursuant to its Article 9.%° According to
the Claimants, Article 9 lays down the conditions under which the Respondent and French investors
are to settle disputes and therefore investor-State dispute settlement is one of the “matiéres” governed
by the France-Mauritius BIT .%’ The Claimants submits that, in order to determine the “matiéres”
governed, it suffices that Article 9 deals with investor-State dispute resolution (which it does,
according to the Claimants); it is irrelevant whether it deals with investor-State treaty dispute

resolution.**

Regarding the second point, the Claimants submit that investor-State dispute settlement is not a matter

excluded from the MFN clause of the France-Mauritius BIT. The Claimants point out that

Article 8(2) expressly excludes from its scope matters governed by Article 7.™° Article 7 relates to

tax matters.*"°

According to the Claimants, because Article 7 does not encompass investor-State
dispute settlement, it follows that this subject matter is included in the operation of the MFN clause
in Article 8(2). Had the Contracting States wished to exclude investor-State dispute settlement from

the MEN clause, they would have made it clear, in the same way as they did for Article 7.7!

The Claimants further note that the 2010 Treaty’s MFN clause similarly does not provide for the

252 This, according to the Claimants, is

exclusion of investor-State dispute settlement from its scope.
a further indication that the application of the MFN clause to investor-State dispute settlement is not

an issue for the Contracting Parties.?*?

- Ses i is des ressortissants, sociétés ou autres personnes morales de l'un des
Etats contractants”**4
The Claimants reject the Respondent’s contention that the MFN clause of the Treaty refers to
investments and not to investors and therefore does not apply to arbitration, which is a personal right
of the investor. According to the Claimants, such an interpretation is rejected by arbitral tribunals
when the text of the MFN clause does not clearly distinguish between the regimes applicable to
investors and those applicable to investments. In support of this argument the Claimants refer, among

other things, to decisions in Siemens AG v. The Argentine Republic*® and Plama Consortium Ltd. v.

-  “bénéficient également”

According to the Claimants, the term “bénéficient également” shows that the Contracting States
wanted to give an automatic effect to the MEN clause in Article 8 of the France-Mauritius BIT.”*!
The Claimants submit that they thus have an unconditional and automatic right to invoke the investor-
State dispute settlement clause of the Finland-Mauritius BIT. According to the Claimants, this right
is not subject to any other condition, including that of establishing the jurisdiction of the arbitral

262

tribunal under the France-Mauritius BIT as alleged by the Respondent.*” The Claimants further point
out that Article 8(2) does not use terms such as “more favourable treatment” which may have been
interpreted as limiting the effect of the MFN clause to the improvement of rights already acquired

under a treaty and as excluding the creation of new rights.”

Mauritius BIT and submit that it does not allow an inference that the MFN clause would not apply to
investor-State dispute settlement clauses. Rather, the Claimants submit that according to the ILC
2015 Report, similar MFN clauses have been interpreted as applying to dispute resolution

provisions.”

- “qui pourraient résulter d’obligatic internati déja souscrites ou qui viendraient

a étre souscrites par cet autre Etat avec le premier Etat contractant ou avec des Etats

 

tiers?21
According to the Claimants, the arbitration agreement in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT is
more favourable than Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT in several respects, including because the
former does not contain any obligation to settle the dispute amicably and offers the investor a choice

between different arbitral institutions.**

In sum, following their analysis of the wording of Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT, the
Claimants conclude that they may benefit from the more favourable arbitration agreement in Article
9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT. The Claimants also make some further submissions, mainly

addressing a series of arguments made by the Respondent.

First, concerning the ejusdem generis principle, the Claimants agree that it limits the application of
MEN clauses to rights that fall within the subject matter of the clause, but state that this condition is
met in the present case.” The Claimants submit that they are merely seeking the application of an
investor-State dispute settlement clause more favourable than that provided for in the Treaty, and are

therefore in the presence of the provisions of the same “‘matiére” with the same object and purpose,

The Claimants accept that States that have consented to MFN clauses should not be faced with an
obligation that they never envisaged.?”! However, according to the Claimants, this does not apply in
the present case because the Respondent, among other things, agreed to (i) ICSID arbitration under
the terms of Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT; (ii) the MFN clause in Article 8(2) in the broadest
terms; (iii) ICSID arbitration and UNCITRAL arbitration in numerous BITs concluded with third
States; (iv) ICSID arbitration in the 2010 Treaty, without excluding it from the scope of the MFN

clause.”

Second, regarding the Respondent’s contention that the Claimants must establish jurisdiction before
being able to invoke the MFN clause in Article 8(2), the Claimants contest the existence of such a

prerequisite.?”*

The Claimants stress that no such conditions is foreseen in the Treaty and no such
principle exists in international law.” Rather, referring to the Nouvel Opinion, the Claimants allege
that “hundreds” of (unidentified) national court decisions show that consent to arbitrate need not be
included in the Basic Treaty containing the MEN clause.””> The Claimants state that the authorities
cited by the Respondent deal with a different issue: they address the question whether it is possible

Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT allows the application of more favourable provisions in
future treaties between France and Mauritius (“qui viendraient a étre souscrites”) and thus consider
that the dispute settlement clause of the 2010 Treaty is accessible to them even though this treaty has

not yet entered into force.”

3. Tribunal’s Decision

The second question before the Tribunal, in order to establish its jurisdiction, is whether the Claimants
can invoke the arbitration agreement in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT on the basis of the
MEN clause in Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT. As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal will
determine whether there is an arbitration agreement, or consent to arbitrate, in the France-Mauritius
BIT. The Tribunal will then set out the legal standard it applies when assessing whether the MFN.
clause in Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT can be used to import the arbitration agreement in
Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT. Finally, the Tribunal will apply this legal standard to the case
at hand.

(a) No Consent to Arbitrate in the France-Mauritius BIT

First, the Tribunal will determine whether it can base its jurisdiction on any provision of the France-
Mauritius BIT. It is uncontested that the France-Mauritius BIT does not contain an arbitration
agreement for investor-State disputes; the Claimants accept that it does not provide for investor-State
arbitration “except for contracts.”

However, Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT contains a provision dealing with investor-State

investment contracts. It provides as follows:

 

“Les accords relatifs aux investissements a effectuer sur le territoire d’ un des Etats contractants,
par les ressortissants, sociétés ou autres personnes morales de l'autre Etat contractant,
comporteront obligatoirement une clause prévoyant que les différends relatifs a ces
investissements devront étre soumis, au cas ott un accord amiable ne pourrait intervenir a bref
délai, au Centre ional pour le ré des différends relatifs aux i en
vue de leur réglement par arbitrage conformément a la Convention sur le réglement des
différends relatifs aux investissements entre Etats et ressortissants d'autres Etats.”?**

Article 9 thus contains an obligation for the Contracting States to include an arbitration agreement in
any possible investment contract they conclude with nationals of the other Contracting State, but no
direct consent to arbitrate any future disputes between one Contracting State and a national of the
other Contracting State.” In 1973, such direct consent to arbitrate was not well-known yet and would
only become a commonly used provision in later investment treaties.° Accordingly, Article 9 of the

France-Mauritius BIT cannot, in and of itself, be the basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Indeed, the Claimants do not contend that Article 9 can be the basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Nevertheless, the Claimants submit that they have a “right to arbitration” because the Respondent
agreed to an investment contract within the meaning of Article 9 in the form of the No-Objection

Letter by which the PMO allegedly accepted the Claimants’ Project.”*”

The Tribunal is unconvinced. First, the No-Objection Letter is not an investment contract between
the Claimants and the Respondent. It is a letter from the PMO to the BOI, merely noting that “[t]his
Office has consulted different stakeholders” and that “[flollowing views received” there was “no
objection to the [P]roject.”*** Such a notification, which is not even addressed to the Claimants, falls
short of an investment contract within the meaning of Article 9. Second, and in any event, it does not

contain an arbitration agreement and therefore cannot be the basis for this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”

short time, disputes arising in connexion with such investments shall be brought before the International Centre
for Settlement of Investment Disputes so that they may be settled by means of arbitration in accordance with
the Convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States.”)
(Translation by the PCA).

On this point, the Claimants’ legal expert notes correctly that “si /e consentement que |'Etat s’oblige a donner
suppose un acte a réaliser (ici l’introduction dans l'accord relatif a l'investissement d'une clause), il ne parait
pas pouvoir s’analyser comme établissant par lui-méme un consentement & la juridiction.” Nouvel Opinion,
para. 73 (Exhibit CER-2) (“If the consent which the State undertakes to give presupposes an act to be carried
out (here, the introduction of a clause into the investment agreement), it does not seem to be able to be analysed
as establishing consent to the jurisdiction by itself.”) (Translation by the PCA).

Letter from the PMO to the Managing Director of the BOI, dated 14 October 2014 (Exhibit C-7).

For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that the appropriate remedy for a violation of Article 9 of the
Treaty (i.e. the conclusion of an investment contract between Contracting State A and nationals of Contracting
State B which does not contain an arbitration agreement as foreseen in Article 9) would be an arbitration by
Contracting State B against Contracting State A pursuant to Article 10 of the Treaty. Compare, for a similar
situation, A. Broches, “Bilateral investment protection treaties and arbitration of investment disputes” in The
Art of Arbitration, Liber Amicorum Pieter Sanders, Kluwer Law and Taxation, 1982, p. 66 (“if the host State
refuses to give consent to the jurisdiction [...] after having been asked to do so by a national of its treaty partner,
the latter State could demand that the former carry out its obligations under the treaty and, if that State persists

Accordingly, since there is no arbitration agreement, or consent to arbitrate, in the France-Mauritius
BIT, the Tribunal will next assess whether the Claimants can use the MEN clause in Article 8(2) of
the France-Mauritius BIT to import the arbitration agreement contained in Article 9 of the Finland-

Mauritius BIT.

(b) Legal Standard to Apply MFN Clauses to Dispute Resolution

MEN clauses, as defined for instance in the ILC 1978 Draft Articles and Commentary, provide
“treatment accorded by the granting State to the beneficiary State [...] not less favourable than
treatment extended by the granting State to a third State [...].”?°? Importantly, MEN treatment is not
an exception to the general rule of the effect of treaties vis-a-vis third States. The right of the
beneficiary State to MFN treatment arises from the MFN clause in the Basic Treaty between the
granting State and the beneficiary State and not from a treaty between the granting State and the third
State.?"! This principle has been affirmed by the International Court of Justice, notably in the Anglo-

Iranian Oil Company case.”

The extent to which MEN clauses apply to procedural obligations, such as the obligation to arbitrate

293

disputes, is a much-debated topic.’ Some arbitral awards have extended MEN clauses to include

in its refusal, have recourse to such remedies as may be available under the treaty and other rules of international
law binding on the parties, including arbitration, which is provided for in most investment protection treaties.”)

arbitration agreements;”™' others have refused to do so.?> While the Tribunal has paid careful

attention to these and other decisions, it is of the opinion that they are only of limited assistance to
this Tribunal because they have been rendered under differently-worded treaties and provide no clear

generic consensus.

The Tribunal is of the view that there is no principled argument for or against the application of an
MEN clause to dispute resolution provisions, i.e. there is no general rule that MFN clauses always or
never apply to dispute resolution. Rather, according to the Tribunal, MFN clauses may apply to
dispute resolution provisions, provided that this is what the contracting States intended. The question
is one regarding the intended scope of the relevant MFN clause and thus a matter of interpretation of

the provision in question.

The Tribunal refers, among other things, to the ILC 2015 Report which states that:

“Although controversial in some of the earlier decisions of tribunals, there is little doubt that in
principle MEN provisions are capable of applying to the dispute settlement provisions of BITs.
[...] In this sense, the question is truly one of treaty interpretation that can be answered only in
respect of each particular case. Where the parties have explicitly included the conditions for
access to dispute settlement within the framework of their MFN provision, then no difficulty
arises. Equally, where the parties have explicitly excluded the application of MFN to the
conditions for access to dispute settlement, no difficulty arises. But the vast majority of MFN
provisions in existing BITs are not explicit on this point and thus the question of how such
provisions are to be interpreted will arise in each case. At the very minimum, however, it can be

said that there is no need for tribunals interpreting MEN provisions in BITs to engage in any
enquiry into whether such provisions may in principle be applicable to dispute settlement
provisions.”2%6

“Whether MFN clauses are to encompass dispute settlement provisions is ultimately up to the

States that negotiate such clauses. Explicit language can ensure that an MEN provision does or

does not apply to dispute settlement provisions. Otherwise the matter will be left to dispute

settlement tribunals to interpret MFN clauses on a case-by-case basis.”?""
In interpreting the scope of the MFN clause in Article 8(2) of the Treaty, the Tribunal applies the
relevant standards of interpretation pursuant to Article 31 VCLT, namely the ordinary meaning of the
terms of the Treaty in its context, as well as its object and purpose. Both the Claimants and the

Respondent have unsurprisingly made reference to those interpretative principles.”

In addition, the Tribunal applies the principle of ejusdem generis, which operates as a general limit
to the application of MFN clauses. The ILC 1978 Draft Articles and Commentary have set forth the
ejusdem generis rule in the following terms:

“Under a most-favoured-nation clause the beneficiary State acquires, for itself or for the benefit

of persons or things in a determined relationship with it, only those rights which fall within the
limits of the subject-matter of the clause.”?””

“Under a most-favoured-nation clause the beneficiary State acquires the right to most-favoured-

nation treatment only if the granting State extends to a third State treatment within the limits of

the subject-matter of the clause.”*
Referring, among other things, to the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Anglo-
Iranian Oil Company case™' and the Ambatielos tribunal’s holdings,” the ILC 1978 Draft Articles
and Commentary note that the ejusdem generis rule “is generally recognized and affirmed by the

jurisprudence of international tribunals and national courts and by diplomatic practice.” The

Parties have stressed the importance of the ejusdem generis rule to interpret MEN clauses.**

The ILC 2015 Report summarises the legal standard to be applied to the interpretation of MFN clauses

as follows:

“The interpretation of MFN clauses is to be undertaken on the basis of the rules for the
interpretation of treaties as set out in the VCLT. The central interpretative issue in respect of
the MEN clauses relates to the scope of the clause and the application of the ejusdem generis
principle. That is, the scope and nature of the benefit that can be obtained under an MFN
provision depends on the interpretation of the MFN provision itself.”3°5

Arbitral tribunals have sometimes provided further guidance on the standard of interpretation of MFN
clauses, endorsing a restrictive standard with a high threshold for claimants. Because consent to
arbitrate must be clear and unequivocal, those tribunals have found that an MEN clause may only be
interpreted as extending to the procedural right to arbitrate if there is clear or express language in the

MEN clause.*”°

The Tribunal agrees with the general principle that consent to arbitrate must be clear and unequivocal

307

and thus cannot be assumed but must be proven by claimants.*’’ However, the Tribunal sees no

reason to deduce therefrom that an MEN clause must expressly refer to dispute resolution for those

matters to be included. Indeed, when interpreting an MFN clause, as any other clause in a treaty, the

Tribunal applies neither a restrictive nor an expansive but an even-handed approach.*°*

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

(c) Interpretation of the MFN Clause in Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT
Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT provides as follows:

“Pour les matiéres régies par la présente Convention autres que celles visées a l'article 7, les
investissements des ressortissants, sociétés ou autres personnes morales de l'un des Etats
contractants bénéficient également de toutes les dispositions plus favorables que celles du
présent Accord qui pourraient résulter d’obligations internationales déja souscrites ou qui
viendraient d étre souscrites par cet autre Etat avec le premier Etat contractant ou avec des Etats
tiers.

  

Pursuant to Article 31(1) VCLT, looking at the ordinary meaning of its terms of Article 8(2) of the
France-Mauritius BIT, the Tribunal finds that the MFN clause contained therein is broadly worded,

albeit with one important limitation.

i Broad Language of Article 8(2)

The wording of the MEN clause, in particular regarding its scope, is broad in principle. It provides
that its beneficiaries shall benefit from more favourable provisions found in existing or future treaties
(“bénéficient également de toutes les dispositions plus favorables que celles du présent Accord”). In
this context, the Tribunal notes in particular that Article 8(2) does not refer to any more favourable
“treatment” or “treatment in the territory” which has been interpreted by some tribunals as limiting

the scope of MEN clauses,*!° but rather to more favourable provisions.

Furthermore, the Tribunal is unconvinced by the Respondent’s argument that the wording
“investissements des ressortissants” should be interpreted as limiting the scope of Article 8(2). The
Respondent submits that because it provides MFN treatment for “/es investissements des

ressortissants [...] de l’un des Etats contractants,” the MFN treatment extends only to investments,

France-Mauritius BIT, Article 8(2) (Exhibit C-2) (“With respect to matters governed by this Treaty other than
those referred to in article 7, the investments of nationals, companies or other corporate bodies of one
Contracting State shall also benefit from any more favourable provisions than those in this Treaty which may
result from international undertakings already entered into or hereafter entered into by the other Contracting
State with the first-mentioned Contracting State or with third States.”) (Translation by the PCA).

See e.g. Plama Consortium Ltd. v. The Republic of Bulgaria, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on
Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, para. 209 (Exhibit RL-26) (“It is one thing to add to the treatment provided in

specifically negotiated by parties with an entirely different mechanism.”); Daimler Financial Services AG v.

but not to investors.*!! According to the Respondent, the right to access dispute resolution is not an
accessory to the investment, but rather a personal right of investors, and therefore the MFN clause in

Article 8(2) does not apply to dispute resolution.*!”

The Tribunal notes that some tribunals have indeed made a distinction between investors and
investments, based on the specific wording of the MFN clauses in the treaties they applied.*!° In the
present case, however, the Tribunal does not find this distinction to be decisive. The France-Mauritius
BIT never refers to “investors” (“investisseurs”) in any of its provisions, but rather to “nationals,
companies or other corporate bodies” (“ressortissants, sociétés ou autres personnes morales”)2\*
The Tribunal understands such reference as a reference to possible investors. Article 8(2) thus refers
to investments of potential investors (“Jes investissements des ressortissants, sociétés ou autres
personnes morales’) and, in those circumstances, construing it as not including investors’ rights

would be overly formalistic.

ti. _ Limitation of Article 8(2): “matiéres régies par la présente Convention”

Despite its broad wording in principle, Article 8(2) contains an important limitation. It applies only
to matters governed by the France-Mauritius BIT other than those referred to in its Article 7
(“matieres régies par la présente Convention autres que celles visées a l’article 7”). In other words,
the beneficiary of the MFN clause can only benefit from a more favourable provision in a third State
treaty if the matter of that provision is also governed by the France-Mauritius BIT, and if it does not

fall within Article 7.

First, it is clear that matters falling within the ambit of Article 7 are excluded from the scope of the

MEN clause. Article 7 deals with tax matters.*!° Dispute resolution does not fall within the ambit of

+16 it does not follow from the fact that

Article 7.. However, contrary to the Claimants’ suggestion,
dispute resolution does not fall with the exception of Article 7 that it is necessarily included in the
scope of Article 8(2). Rather, the Claimants still need to establish that the matter falls within one of

the matters governed by the Treaty, as expressly provided for by Article 8(2).

Second, the question is thus whether the matter covered by the more favourable provision that the
Claimants wish to invoke (i.e. Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT) is also governed by the France-
Mauritius BIT, in particular its Article 9.*” It is undisputed that Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius
BIT contains direct consent for investor-State arbitration and thus provides the investor with a right
to arbitrate any dispute falling within the scope of the treaty. However, the Parties disagree as to the
effect of Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT. The Respondent argues that it does not deal with
investor-State arbitration since it only contains an obligation for the Contracting States to include an

318

arbitration agreement in future investment contracts. For their part, the Claimants argue that

Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT deals with investor-State arbitration because it establishes the

conditions under which the Respondent and French nationals are to settle their disputes.*!°

The Tribunal notes that both provisions (i.e. Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT and Article 9 of
the Finland-Mauritius BIT) mention or contemplate investor-State arbitration. However, under
Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT, the relevant test is not whether a matter is contemplated by

the Treaty but whether it is governed by it. This is what the express wording of Article 8(2) requires

morales ressortissantes de ladite Partie et se trouvant dans la méme situation. Cette disposition ne met pas
obstacle a l’octroi par chaque Gi ses propres ressortissants dt -s spécifiques préfe

en matiére d'investissements, dans la mesure out ces avantages ne "sont pas de nature a fausser les conditions

be subject, in the territory of the other Party, to duties, taxes or contributions of any description which are other
or higher than those levied on individuals or legal persons of the latter Party in the same situation. This
provision shall not prevent each Government from granting specific preferential advantages to its own nationals
with respect to investment to the extent that such advantages do not distort market conditions.”) (Translation
by the PCA).

 

See above, para. 76.

The Tribunal notes that this was also the question the Dawood Rawat tribunal indicated as being decisive.
While the Dawood Rawat tribunal did not decide the issue, since it dismissed jurisdiction on a different ba:
it indicated that “the question to be resolved would have included defined for MFN purposes the “matiére” in
Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT and the “martiére” in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT, and deciding
whether those were of the same kind.” Dawood Rawat v. The Republic of Mauritius, PCA Case 2016-20,
Award on Jurisdiction, 6 April 2018, para. 187 (Exhibit RL-20).

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

by specifically stating that the MFN clause only applies to matters governed (“régies’’) by the Treaty.

In the Tribunal’s view, Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT plainly does not govern investor-State
arbitration. As detailed above, it contains an obligation for the Contracting States to include an
arbitration agreement in an investment contract, if a Contracting State opts to enter into such a
contract with a national of the other Contracting State.*” In that situation, any dispute between the
investor and the State would be governed by the arbitration clause in the contract and not by Article 9.
Accordingly, investor-State arbitration is simply not one of the matters governed (“matiéres régies”)
by Article 9. The contractual clauses contemplated by Article 9 may contain an infinite number of
specificities unknown by the drafters of Article 9. The latter therefore could not and does not govern
dispute resolution with respect to any claim concerning an investment under the France-Mauritius

BIT.

In sum, for the reasons set out above, taking into account the specific wording of Article 8(2), the
Tribunal finds that investor-State arbitration is not a matter governed by the France-Mauritius BIT
and therefore the MFN clause contained in Article 8(2) does not extend to this matter. This
conclusion, based on the specific wording of the MFN clause, is further confirmed by the ejusdem

generis principle, discussed in the next section.

(d) Ejusdem Generis Principle

As stated above, ejusdem generis is a generally recognized principle which operates as a limit to the
application of MFN clauses.*”! As correctly pointed out by the Claimants’ legal expert, the limitation
in Article 8(2) to “matiéres régies par la présente Convention” is a clear reference to this principle.”

Its import is that the MFN treatment is limited to “rights which fall within the limits of the subject-

99323,

matter of the clause. In the words of the tribunal in the Ambatielos case:

See above, paras. 191-192.
See above, paras. 200-201.

Crépet-Daigremont Opinion, para. 28 (“La régle ejusdem generis découle de la supposition que les Etats parties
@ une clause NPF ont nécessairement limité son champ d’application a un domaine convenu de relations [...]
en visant ‘les matiéres régies par la présente Convention’ é l'article 8 al. 2 du TBI, la France et la République
de Maurice entendaient certainement rappeler ce principe d’identité de genre.”) (“The ejusdem generis rule
stems from the assumption that MFN States Parties have limited its scope to an agreed area of relations ... by
referring to ‘matters governed by this Convention’ in Article 8(2) of the BIT, France and the Republic of
Mauritius certainly intended to recall this principle of identity of type.”).

] the most-favoured-nation clause can only attract matters belonging to the same category of
subject as that to which the clause itself related.”>?*

 

The purpose of the ejusdem generis rule is to prevent a State, via the application of the MFN clause,
from seeing its obligations extended to matters it did not contemplate. As explained by the ILC 1978

Draft Articles and Commentary:

“The effect of the most-favoured-nation process is, by means of the provisions of one treaty, to
attract those of another. Unless this process is strictly confined to where there is a substantial
identity between the subject-matter of the two sets of clauses concerned, the result in a number
of cases may be to impose upon the granting State obligations it never contemplated. Thus the
rule follows clearly from the general principles of treaty interpretation. States cannot be regarded
as being bound beyond the obligations they have undertaken.”*25

 

The question is therefore whether there is a “substantial identity” between the subject matter of
Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT and the subject matter of Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius
BIT. The Tribunal is not convinced that this is the case. The two provisions are fundamentally
different. Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT allows Finnish investors to bring arbitral
proceedings against France on the basis of direct consent given in that treaty, provided the dispute
falls within the scope thereof. Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT does not allow French investors
to do any such thing. It only allows French investors (or rather: France, as a Contracting State) to
impose on the Respondent the inclusion of an arbitration clause in any investment contract it enters
into with French nationals. However, the Respondent remains free to choose whether or not to enter
into such investment contract and thus whether or not to be bound by an arbitration clause.
Accordingly, whereas Finland has given consent to arbitrate treaty-disputes in Article 9 of the
Finland-Mauritius BIT, the Respondent has not given any consent to arbitrate — not even with respect
to contractual investor-State disputes — in Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT. In light of these
fundamental differences, there cannot be any substantial identity between the subject matter of the

two provisions.

Any other solution would result in the Respondent being bound by obligations it did not contemplate
and thus would undermine the limits of MFN clauses in international law under the ejusdem generis

principle. The Respondent did not consent to arbitrate investor-State disputes in the Treaty — whether

for treaty disputes or contractual disputes. Using the MEN clause to import such consent would create
new obligations the Respondent never undertook. As pertinently noted by Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice:
“Nothing undermines confidence in the process of international adjudication so quickly and
completely as the feeling that international tribunals may assume jurisdiction in cases not really
covered by the intended scope of the consents given by the parties.”*°°
The Claimants’ argument that the Respondent’s consent could be construed from the Respondent’s
actions outside the Treaty (including by having accepted investor-State arbitration in BITs with other
States or by favouring arbitration generally*”’) misses the point. The question is not whether the
Respondent consented to arbitration elsewhere, but whether it consented to it in the Treaty, so that
the subject matters of the Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT and Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius

could be considered of the same kind.

The Tribunal further notes that the Dawood Rawat tribunal also considered the ejusdem generis rule
to be the core question for the application of the MFN provision. Even though that tribunal did not
decide the issue related to the application of the MFN clause, it noted that the “heart” of the ejusdem
generis test would have been to compare the “matiéres” of the two provisions in question (i.e.
Article 9 of the France-Mauritius BIT and Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius).** In this context, the
tribunal further noted that “this would have involved an assessment of the level of granularity at which
the ‘matiéres’ needed to be considered [...].”*?? By level of granularity the tribunal meant that “for
instance ‘dispute settlement’ is less granular as a ‘matiére’ than ‘investor-[S]tate dispute settlement,’
which is itself less granular than ‘contractual investor-[S]tate dispute settlement.””**°

The Tribunal agrees with the approach set out by the tribunal in Dawood Rawat. It is not convinced
that the modest level of granularity achieved by the expression “dispute settlement” would be
sufficient to find that two provisions are of the same kind. For instance, the mere fact that the

Respondent agreed to dispute settlement for State-to-State arbitration in Article 10 of the France-

(Exhibit RL-8).

Award on Jurisdiction

Mauritius BIT cannot be sufficient to conclude that consent to investor-State arbitration could be
imported from another treaty. These obligations concern substantially different subject matters.
Moreover, for the reasons set out above, the France-Mauritius BIT in fact did not provided consent
by the Respondent to arbitrate either investor-State treaty disputes or contractual investor-State
disputes. Accordingly, the test set out in Dawood Rawat would defeat the Claimants’ jurisdictional

theory at either level of granularity.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that this is an area where other arbitral tribunals — albeit deciding under
different treaties and in different contexts — have come to remarkably similar results. Indeed, even
though none of the cases concern a situation in which the Basic Treaty lacks any consent to arbitrate
investor-State disputes,**! arbitral tribunals have concluded (with varied reasoning) that consent to

arbitrate could not be imported via the MFN clause from a third State treaty.

For instance, in Venezuela US, S.R.L. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the tribunal found as

follows:

“The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the MFN clause cannot serve the purpose of
importing consent to arbitration when none exists under the [Basic] BIT.”

In A//Y Ltd. v. Czech Republic, the tribunal explained that:

“[...] where there is no consent to arbitrate certain disputes under the [B]asic Treaty, an MFN
clause cannot be relied upon to create that consent unless the Contracting Parties clearly and
explicitly agreed thereto.”**

 

In the Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic case, the tribunal noted that:

“the State must have consented to the particular type of dispute settlement in question before the
claimant may raise any MFN claims before the designated forum.”>*4

The only case in which there was a lack of consent in the Basic Treaty containing the MFN clause is different
in that it was not an investment treaty. See Menzies Middle East and Africa S.A. and Aviation Handling Services
International Ltd. v. Republic of Senegal, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/21, 5 August 2016 (Exhibit RL-

Other cases contain similar statements.**°
The only decision cited by the Claimants as stating the contrary, Garanti Koza LLP v. Turkmenistan,
is actually not on point. In that case, the MFN clause specifically provided that it applied to dispute

resolution and it was clear that the Basic Treaty contained at least some form of consent to arbitrate.**°

While the above-mentioned decisions were rendered under differently-worded treaties and in
different contexts, and thus do not apply directly to the case at hand,**’ the consistency in results is
noteworthy. Indeed, where the Basic Treaty does not contain consent to arbitrate investor-State
disputes at all, the Tribunal cannot imagine any circumstances in which the ejusdem generis rule
would be met. The subject matter of the provision to be imported from a third-State treaty containing
consent to arbitrate would always be different from the one in the Basic Treaty containing no consent.

The ejusdem generis rule constitutes the outer limit of any, even ever so broad, MEN clause.

(e) Relevance of Post-Treaty Practice

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal further notes, by reference to the Parties’ observations in
this respect, that the above solution is also confirmed looking at the context of the Treaty under

Article 31 VCLT.

First, the Parties have referred to one Contracting State’s treaty practice with third States.** The
Tribunal does not consider these of particular relevance. In the present case, the fact that France and
Mauritius have included certain MEN clauses or dispute resolution clauses in treaties with third States
does not bind them to a particular interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty concluded

between them. In that sense, the ILC 2015 Report noted that:

See e.g. Hochtief AG v. The Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction,
24 October 2011, para. 81 (Exhibit RL-24) (“it cannot be assumed that [the Contracting States] intended that
the MEN clause should create wholly new rights where none otherwise existed under the [Basic] BIT.”).

Garanti Koza LLP v. Turkmenistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/20, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 July 2013,
paras. 26-29, 42-44 (Exhibit CL-4).

The Claimants are thus right to point out that they are not directly relevant to the case at hand. See above,
para. 187

“The actions of one State party to a BIT that do not involve the other State party might have some
contextual relevance by demonstrating the attitude of one of the parties to the treaty. However,
such actions do not fall under (3)(b) of the Vienna Convention, which considers the common.
intent of the parties but may be taken into account under article 32.”3°°

Second, the Parties have also discussed the 2010 Treaty in this respect.¥°

As stated above, the
Contracting States negotiated and signed (but did not ratify) a new treaty in 2010.*4! While the 2010
Treaty is not in force, it allows for some insight into the Contracting States’ views on the 1973 Treaty.
For instance, the draft bill by which the French Parliament was asked to ratify the 2010 Treaty (but

failed to do so), noted as follows:

 

“A Maurice, les investi francais bénéficient de l'accord de 1 ion des ii

(API) signé le 22 mars 1973 et entré en vigueur le Ler avril 1974. Cependant, cet API présente
des faiblesses, [...]. Le champ du réglement des différends investisseur-Etat est limité puisque
l'accord présuppose l’existence d’une clause compromissoire dans le contrat d’investissement.
Or, conformément a 1’évolution du droit international des investissements, la pratique
conventionnelle francaise a évolué afin de permettre aux investisseurs connaissant un préjudice
du fait des agissements de l'Etat d'accueil de leur investissement de recourir 4 Varbitrage
international sur la base du consentement exprimé par V’Etat dans V’API. C'est donc
essentiellement pour mettre cet accord en conformité avec I'évolution de la pratique
conventionnelle qu'une renégociation a été engagée avec le gouvernement de Maurice en
2005.”37

 

Had France been convinced that its nationals have access to arbitration via the use of the MFN clause
in the 1973 Treaty, it would not have insisted that the investor-State arbitration provision in the 2010

Treaty was one of the reasons the new treaty was needed.

The Claimants’ argument that the 2010 Treaty supports the opposite view is not convincing. For

instance, the fact that the 2010 Treaty now contains an arbitration agreement with direct consent to

ILC 2015 Report, para. 182 (Exhibit CL-2 = RL-18).

R-4) (emphasis added) (“In Mauritius, French investors benefit from the agreement on the protection of
investments (API) signed on 22 March 1973 and which entered into force on 1 April 1974. However, this API
presents some weaknesses. The scope of investor-State dispute settlement is limited because the agreement
presupposes the existence of an arbitration clause in the investment contract. Yet, in accordance with the
evolution of the international law of investments, French treaty practice has evolved to allow investors who
have been harmed by the actions of the host State of their investment to resort to international arbitration on
the basis of the consent expressed by the State in the API. It is therefore essentially to bring this agreement in
line with the evolution of treaty practice that a renegotiation was initiated with the Government of Mauritius in
2005.”) (Translation by the PCA).

investor-State disputes does not mean that such a provision should also apply to the 1973 Treaty. To
the extent that the Claimants’ argument would have the result that the 2010 Treaty should apply even
though it has not entered into force,*“? it goes directly against the most basic principles of international
law. Even taking into account that the MEN clause in Article 8(2) refers to the application of future
obligations to be entered into (“obligations internationales [...] qui viendraient a étre souscrites”)

this presupposes that these future obligations come into effect.**

Moreover, the fact that the 2010 Treaty does not provide for an express exclusion of investor-State
dispute settlement from the scope of the MFN clause*® does not assist in the interpretation of the
MEN clause in the 1973 Treaty. Any express exclusion of investor-State dispute settlement from the
scope of the MEN clause in the 2010 Treaty (or lack thereof) merely applies to the interpretation of

that treaty and not its predecessor.

In sum, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants cannot invoke the
arbitration agreement in Article 9 of the Finland-Mauritius BIT on the basis of the MEN clause in
Article 8(2) of the France-Mauritius BIT. The Tribunal therefore holds that it has no jurisdiction over

the Claimants’ claims in this case.

The Respondent requests an award on costs in its favour in the amounts of USD 458,875.96 (being

For the same reasons, the Claimants’ argument that the Respondent violated Article 18 VCLT by failing to
accept the application of the arbitration agreement of the 2010 Treaty by anticipation, before the 2010 Treaty
entered into force (see above, footnote 280), is equally mistaken.

According to the Respondent, the successful party is entitled to costs under the UNCITRAL Rules,
both for arbitration costs and costs of “legal representation and assistance.”**” The Respondent argues
that it has been “dragged into these proceedings” although the Claimants’ claims lacked “any basis

in full.*8

Regarding the Claimants’ Submissions on Costs, the Respondent argues among other things that
(i) the Claimants have not provided a break-down of their costs; (ii) the Claimants’ internal costs
are not recoverable unless there is “justification of reasonableness;”*”° (iii) the Claimants took a
deliberate risk in initiating this arbitration;**! and (iv) the fact that the Claimants are natural persons

that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

 

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-
General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.”

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules further provides in its relevant parts:

“(1) Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the
ful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of
the case.

    

(2) With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38,
paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free
to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if
it determines that apportionment is reasonable.”
In light of the above, and having carefully considered the Parties’ submissions on costs, the Tribunal

decides as follows.

1. Arbitration Costs

Pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal fixes the arbitration costs at
EUR 391,692.00. The PCA’s Statement of Account dated 22 August 2019 is annexed to this Award.
The PCA will return the surplus (EUR 58,308) to the Parties in equal shares (EUR 29,154 to each
Party).

Pursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, these arbitration costs “shall in principle be borne
by the unsuccessful party” unless the Tribunal determines that an apportionment of the arbitration
costs between the parties “is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.” Arbitral

tribunals have interpreted this provision as a presumption in favour of the “costs follow the event”

rule?

PCA Case No. 2018-37
Award on Jurisdiction

In the present case, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the presumption established in
Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Claimants were unsuccessful on both prongs of their
jurisdictional argument. Accordingly, the Claimants as the unsuccessful Parties should bear the
arbitration costs in full. The Claimants therefore are ordered to pay EUR 195,846 to the Respondent,
corresponding to its share of the arbitration costs. The payment is to be made within 60 days of the
date of this Award. After that date, in case of non-payment, interests are due at the rate of 6-month

EUR LIBOR + 2% per year, compounded bi-annually.

2. Costs of Legal Representation

Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules deals with costs of legal representation and assistance referred
to in Article 38(f). Contrary to Article 40(1) referred to above, Article 40(2) does not establish any
presumption that the costs of legal representation and assistance shall be borne by the unsuccessful
party. Rather, Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides broad discretion to arbitral tribunals,
stating that they “shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such
costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.” The only direction given

in Article 40(2) is that tribunals shall take “into account the circumstances of the case.”

Arbitral tribunals have noted the difference between Articles 40(1) and 40(2), and emphasised the
broad discretion provided to them under the latter In the exercise of this discretion, arbitral
tribunals have taken into account not only the relative success of the parties’ claims and defences, but
also the proportionality of the prevailing party’s costs to the other’s, the material economy of the way
the later marshalled its evidence and submissions, the sobriety and restraint in its choice of arguments,

and its cooperativeness and civility with respect to matters of procedure.**! Needless to say, the

recovery of the prevailing party is likely to be higher if it had to face frivous claims or unreasonable
conduct. In addition, one may conceivably take account of the fact that the merits of the claims of a

party which failed at the jurisdictional hurdle have not been been heard, as opposed to the case of a

representation and assistance.*°

For the avoidance of doubt, this also includes any costs of legal experts and any possible internal costs.
