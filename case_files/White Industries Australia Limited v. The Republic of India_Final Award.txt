1.2.1

Overview

This arbitration concerns a dispute over whether, and if so, the extent to which the
Republic of India (“Respondent” or “India” or “the Republic”) has breached its
obligations to White Industries Australia Limited “Claimant” or “White”) arising
under The Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of
the Republic of India on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, made in New
Delhi on 6 February 1999 (“BIT”). Claimant alleges that Respondent has breached
its obligations under Articles 3, 4, 7 and 9 of the BIT, as a result of which it has
suffered loss and damage in the amount of A$8,769,469.07. Respondent denies each
of the alleged breaches of the BIT and says, in addition, that the Tribunal does not
have jurisdiction to hear this claim as Claimant is not an “investor” in India, and none
of the “assets” on which it relies as constituting “investments” into India qualify as

such under Article I of the BIT.

The Arbitration Agreement

Article 12 of the BIT provides a dispute resolution mechanism to investors from one
Contracting Party against the other Contracting Party in which their investment is
made (the “Host State”). When the Host State is thought to have breached its
obligations to protect investments made within the Host State’s area by nationals of

the other Contracting Party, Article 12 provides:

“Settlement of disputes between an investor and a Contracting Party

dl. Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party in relation to an investment of the former under this Agreement
shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through negotiations between the Parties
to the dispute.

2. Any such dispute which has not been amicably settled may, if both Parties
agree, be submitted:

 

3.

(a) for resolution, in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party
which has admitted the investment to that Contracting Party’s competent
judicial or administrative bodies; or

(b) to international conciliation under the Conciliation Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law.

Should the Parties fail to agree on a dispute settlement procedure provided

under paragraph 2 of this article or where a dispute is referred to conciliation but
conciliation proceedings are terminated other than by signing of a settlement
agreement, the dispute may be referred to Arbitration. The Arbitration procedure
shall be as follows:

(a) if the Contracting Party of the investor and the other Contracting
Party are both Parties to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, 1965, and both Parties
to the dispute consent in writing to submit the dispute to the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes such a dispute shall be referred
to the Centre;

(b) if both Parties to the dispute so agree, under the Additional Facility for
the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact Finding Proceedings;
or

(c) to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal by either Party to the dispute in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law, 1976, subject to the following provisions;

(i) The arbitral tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each Party
shall select an arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall appoint by
mutual agreement a third arbitrator, the Chairperson, who shall be a
national of a third State. All arbitrators shall be appointed within two
months from the date when one of the Parties to the dispute informs the
other of its intention to submit the dispute to arbitration;

(ii) If the necessary appointments are not made within the period specified
in sub-paragraph (c)(i), either Party may, in the absence of any other
agreement, request the President of the International Court of Justice
to make the necessary appointments;

(iii) The arbitral award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement;

(iv) — The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes;

(v) The decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding and the
parties shall abide by and comply with the terms of its award;

(vi) The arbitral tribunal shall state the basis of its decision and give
reasons upon the request of either Party;

 

13

(vii) Each Party concerned shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator and its
representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the
Chairperson in discharging his or her arbitral function and the
remaining costs of the tribunal shall be borne equally by the Parties
concerned. The tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a
higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the two Parties,
and this award shall be binding on both Parties.

4. Once an action referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article has been
taken, neither Contracting Party shall pursue the dispute through diplomatic channels
unless:

(a) the relevant judicial or administrative body, the Secretary General of
the Centre, the arbitral authority or tribunal or the conciliation commission,
as the case may be, has decided that it has no jurisdiction in relation to the
dispute in question; or

(b) the other Contracting Party has failed to abide by or comply with any
judgement, award, order or other determination made by the body in
question.”

2.2.1

Initial Pleadings
These arbitration proceedings were initiated on 27 July 2010, by Claimant’s filing of a

Notice of Arbitration on that date.

On 9 November 2010, the parties were notified by the co-arbitrators of their selection

and appointment of Mr Rowley as the presiding arbitrator of the Tribunal

On 23 November 2010, Claimant served an Amended Notice of Arbitration which, it

advised, would stand as Claimant’s Statement of Claim in this arbitration.

Agreed Timetable and Procedures, Terms of Appointment and Subsequent
Pleadings

On 15 November 2010, the Chairman wrote to the parties enclosing for their

consideration draft Terms of Appointment for the Tribunal. The parties were also

invited to consult together with a view to seeing if they were able to propose to the

Tribunal an agreed timetable and set of procedures for the conduct of the arbitration.

By late November 2010, the Tribunal’s Terms of Appointment had been agreed in
principle and were circulated for execution by the parties and members of the

Tribunal.

During the same timeframe the parties had proposed an agreed timetable and set of
procedures for the arbitration with which the members of the Tribunal agreed.

Accordingly, on 1 December 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1.

Following further discussions between the Parties in January 2011 the Terms of

Appointment were finalised and re-circulated for execution.
On 14 February 2011, Respondent filed its Statement of Defence.

On 18 February 2011, Respondent requested the production of certain documents

from Claimant.

On 21 February 2011, Claimant agreed to produce the documents requested by

Respondent and confirmed that it did not request any documents from Respondent.

On 7 June 2011, each of the parties filed its Memorial together with supporting

documentation, statements and authorities.
Claimant filed witness statements from:
Mr Harnett Singh Chandhoke Mr Allan Roy

Mr David Thomas Knappick Mr William Duncan Travers

Chakraborty. An expert report was separately filed from Justice B. N. Srikrishna.

On 19 June 2011, the parties advised the Tribunal that they were in discussions about
the possibility of moving the hearing from Singapore to London, a more convenient

place for a number of potential witnesses.

On 4 July 2011, the parties confirmed, with the Tribunal’s prior approval, that they

had agreed to move the hearing to London.

On 14 August 2011, Claimant filed its Reply Memorial with the Tribunal without

further witness statements or expert reports.

On 18 August 2011, Respondent filed its Reply Memorial with the Tribunal, and on

the same date, the parties exchanged their Reply Memorials.

Respondent filed with its Reply Memorial an additional expert report from Justice
Srikrishra, an additional witness statement from Mr Chakraborty and witness

statements from Mr Sharad Ghodke and Mr Rajinder Singh Malhotra.

On 25 August 2011, the parties held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Chairman

to agree to and settle the details for the conduct of the hearing.

Oral Hearing

An oral hearing was held on 19-21 September 2011 at the IDRC, 70 Fleet Street,
London, EC4Y 1EU, United Kingdom. The hearing was recorded and transcribed.
The transcripts were corrected, to the extent required, by the parties following the

hearing.

At the hearing, the parties, by agreement, advised the Tribunal that they would not

require to cross-examine each others’ witnesses.

In the light of the parties’ prior agreement, the available time at the hearing was

divided roughly equally.

On 14 October 2011, each of the parties filed a bill of costs together with its

submissions as to the allocation of the costs in the proceedings.

On 21 October 2011, India commented on White’s bill of costs and proposed
allocation of costs. Although entitled to do so, White did not comment on India’s bill

of costs.

On 4 November 2011, pursuant to Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal
notified the parties that it had that day declared the proceedings closed as regards the

filing by the parties of further evidence or submissions.

Following the hearing, the members of the Tribunal deliberated by various means of
communication including a meeting in London, United Kingdom on 22 September
2011. In reaching its conclusions in this Award, the Tribunal has taken into account

all pleadings, documents and oral submissions filed in this case.

Throughout the course of these proceedings, the Tribunal has been greatly assisted by
the submissions of counsel, who, in turn, were helped by many others whose names
do not appear in the transcriptions of the hearings. It is, therefore, appropriate at the
beginning of this Award to record our appreciation of the excellent efforts which
counsel for the disputing parties have brought to bear during these proceedings,

together with their respective experts, assistants and other advisers.

3. THE FACTS

The Tribunal’s Approach to the Facts

A review of disputing parties’ submissions, witness statements and the oral testimony

ll

given at the hearing indicates that, with few exceptions, the factual matrix out of
which this dispute arises is either agreed or not seriously disputed. Put another way,

i most of the differences between the parties have to do with the implications arising
from, or the interpretation to be given, the events which unfolded and the parties’
competing visions as to the extent of the Republic’s obligations to White under the
BIT, its applicability on the facts, and India’s responsibility for the acts and omissions

of Coal India.

3.1.2 We set out in detail below a summary of the facts most relevant to the dispute - either

as agreed, not disputed or determined by the Tribunal.

3.2 Background
3.2.1. During the 1970’s and 1980’s, India decided that it needed to develop its coal
resources. One of the areas of focus was Piparwar and, through its state-owned and

controlled company, Coal India, India began exploration work there in the late 70’s.

3.2.2 At that time, Coal India was a Public Sector Undertaking incorporated under Sections
6/7 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956, which was engaged in coal mining and
responsible for the coal mining sector in India. As a Public Sector Undertaking, Coal
India discharged purely commercial functions. To this end, Coal India had been
conferred with various powers, including, within limits, the power to approve its own
projects. However, with respect to projects proposed to be undertaken whose capital
requirements exceeded those which its board of directors was entitled to approve,
approval was required from the Government of India (“GOI”).' The approval

procedure in such cases involved the preparation of a project feasibility report for

i "Tn 2008-2009, Coal India was awarded “Navratna” status which enabled it, thereafter, to take decisions on new
| projects and the use of funds without formal approval from the GOI.

consideration first by Coal India’s board and thereafter the GOI.

Between 1978 and 1982, Coal India’s subsidiary, Central Mine Planning and Design
Institute Limited (““CMPDI’) undertook extensive drilling in the region where the
Piparwar mine would subsequently be located and produced a report for the

development of an open cast mine.

Subsequently, meetings were held between high level officials of the Australian and
Indian governments to determine whether the governments could co-operate in any
ventures, particularly in the mining industry. The Australian government indicated
that it might be prepared to assist India with the financing for particular

developments.

Shortly afterwards, a delegation from India’s Ministry of Coal and Coal India visited
Australia to inspect Australian mining technology. Various Australian companies,

including White, were involved in the “marketing” to the Indian representatives.

After the representatives returned to India, it appears that CMPDI was requested by
the Ministry of Coal to prepare a feasibility report in relation to the development of

the mine at Piparwar.

CMPDI commenced preparation of that report in around 1988, and requested White to
assist in its preparation, White assisted CMPDI in the preparation of that report as
well as another detailed feasibility study. Claimant’s ultimate interest was to
negotiate a contract with Coal India to supply equipment (principally an in-pit mobile

crushing and conveying system and related technology for the project).

Project feasibility reports were presented by CMPDI to the Indian Public Investment
Board in April 1989 and, in September that same year, the GOI approved the

13

3.2.9

3.2.10

3.2.11

3.2.12

development of the mine and the consequent expenditures (estimated by GOI at the
time to be Rs 542.43 crores - or approximately A$506 million). As noted above, GOI
approval for the project was required because its capital requirements were greater

than the limits Coal India’s board was empowered to approve at that time.

Throughout this period, representatives of Claimant travelled to India on several
occasions and met with various Indian government officials. Claimant was told at
these meetings that Respondent was a safe place in which to invest and that India’s
laws were derived from English law, so Claimant would understand the legal system

and would be treated fairly.

At this time, Coal India did not have the ability to fund the importation of the
equipment and technology which White, amongst others, were hoping to supply.
However, as part of Australia’s efforts to strengthen its bilateral trade relationship
with India, the Australian Trade Commission (““ATC” or “AUSTRADE”) became
involved. The role of AUSTRADE was as a potential facilitator of a funding package
to enable Coal India to purchase goods and services from Australia with funding from

Australia’s Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (“EFIC”).

A typical funding package consists of a Development Import Finance Facility
(“DIFF”) grant, which is provided by AUSTRADE, as well as Export Credit
Financing which is provided by the EFIC. The availability of such funding packages
means that an Australian company (in the present case, White) has the potential to
offer its buyer a loan funded by AUSTRADE and the EFIC, which can obviously help

to make it possible for a buyer (in this case, Coal India) to enter into a contract.

During 1987 to 1989, Coal India and White engaged in contractual negotiations with a
view to entering into an agreement over the Piparwar Project. There were parallel

14

3.2.13

3.2.14

discussions between Coal India, White and AUSTRADE-EFIC concerning how
White’s technology would be imported by Coal India, the loan facility to be provided
by AUSTRADE, the mechanism through which White would secure its payments,
and the obligations of Coal India under the Loan Agreement with EFIC, as well as the

contractual terms between White and Coal India.

On 28 September 1989, against the background of the preceding discussions, White
entered into a contract with Coal India (on behalf of its subsidiary, Central Coalfields
Limited) for the supply of equipment to, and development of a coal mine at Piparwar,

India (“Contract”). In return, White was to be paid approximately A$206.6 million.

Whilst White met with officials from the GOI in the course of discussions with
respect to its participation, in principle, in the Piparwar Project, GOI officials did not
participate in the negotiations of the Contract. Rather the Contract was negotiated

directly between Coal India and White personnel.

3.2.15 The “whereas” clause of the Contract provides:

“Pursuant to Indo-Australian meeting on Coal held in
November 1986 a proposal summary and financial offer was
made by Australian Trade Commission (“AUSTRADE /
EFIC’”) in conjunction with WIL (selected by
AUSTRADE/EFIC for the development of the project as
Annexure I to this agreement during November 1987 for the
supply of foreign equipment, and the management of the local
development of the:

- Piparwar Coal Mines;
- Piparwar Coal Handling Facilities: and
- Piparwar Coal Preparation Plant,

for Central Coal Fields Limited (“CCL”), a subsidiary of CIL, India (“the
project”).

3.2.16 The objective of the contract was set out in Article 2.1 as follows:

15

+1.

“the objective of this Agreement is to develop an Open Cast
Coal Mine at Piparwar, CCL, under Australia/India
Bilateral Assistance, with a rated capacity of at least 6.50
MTPA of ROM coal and 3.5 Mcum PA of over-burden and at
least 5.525 MTPA of Beneficiated Coal and a productivity of
31 tonnes per shift of ROM coal within 66 months from the
date this Agreement comes into force and capital estimates
for equipment, services and manpower to be rendered by
WIL.”
3.2.17 Article 3.0 of the Contract headed “PROVISION OF SERVICES” provides as
follows:
“the provision of services under this Agreement will consist of
two independent parts -
PART I: SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT
WIL will supply Equipment and Equipment related
spares/exchange assemblies in accordance with the terms of
Part I of this Agreement.
PART II: TECHNICAL SERVICES

WIL will provide technical services in accordance with the
terms of PART II of this Agreement.”

3.2.18 The Contract is governed by Indian law. It contains an arbitration clause requiring the
parties to arbitrate all disputes under the ICC Arbitration Rules. The Contract

excludes the operation of the Indian Arbitration Act 1940.

3.2.19 The Contract provides for a production target of 2.76 million tonnes of washed and
processed coal to be produced by the Coal Preparation Plant during an initial six

month demonstration period.

3.2.20 The Contract provides that White was to be entitled to a bonus where production was
in excess of the target figure and, conversely, White was also liable to a penalty where

production was below the target figure.

3.2.21 In addition, White was to be entitled to a Coal Handling Plant bonus (or subject to a

16

 

 

3.2.22

3.2.23

3.2.24

3.2.25

Coal Handling Plant penalty) in certain circumstances.

At the same time as it entered into the Contract, Coal India also entered into a Credit
Agreement with AUSTRADE-EFIC (“Credit Agreement”) which provided Coal
India with “soft loan financing for the Piparwar Integrated Mine - Cum - Coal
Beneficiation Project”. The Credit Agreement notes that Coal India, as borrower,
requested “EFIC to finance the Contract for the import of foreign goods and services
...”” and that EFIC agreed “to make available the Credit Facility from which EFIC ...
may make loans to the Borrower to assist the Borrower to finance the Contract for the

supply of Eligible Goods and Eligible Services”.

Under the Credit Agreement, Coal India, as the Borrower, irrevocably authorised
EFIC “to make payment of proceeds of each Disbursement in Australian currency at
the Exchange Rate to or at the direction of the Exporter or into the Exporter’s
Account [White]” and it agreed that “each payment so made shall constitute a loan to

the Borrower. The currency of account and payment of which is German currency”.

Disputes subsequently arose between Coal India and White as to whether White was
entitled to the bonuses and/or Coal India was entitled to penalty payments. A number
of other related technical disputes also arose, primarily concerning the quality of the
washed and processed coal and the sampling process by which quality would be

measured.

Coal India considered that a penalty was due under the Contract because it felt that
the quality of washed coal produced by the Coal Preparation Plant did not meet the
contractual standard. In these circumstances, Coal India rejected White’s demand for
payment of a bonus on the Coal Handling Plant and Coal Preparation Plant and
cashed the Bank Guarantee (the “Bank Guarantee”) to the extent of A$2,772,640.

3.2.27

3.2.28

3.2.29

3.2.30

3.2.31

3.2.32

3.2.33

Prior to encashing the Bank Guarantee Coal India requested White to extend it, but

the extension requested was not granted.

The GOL had nothing to do with and did not play a part in Coal India’s decision to

draw down the Bank Guarantee.

Coal India called upon a Bank Guarantee provided by Claimant in the amount of

A$2.77 million. This was cashed by Coal India and the money retained.

White filed a Request for Arbitration with the ICC dated 28 June 1999. A tribunal
(sometimes “ICC tribunal”) consisting of Mr Max Abrahamson, Mr Trevor Morling

QC and Justice Jevan Reddy was appointed.

The Contract did not stipulate the seat of the arbitration. In accordance with the ICC
Arbitration Rules, the ICC Court fixed Paris as the place of arbitration. The parties

agreed that, for convenience, the hearings of the arbitration would be in London.

The arbitration was held in London between 15 and 25 May 2000. Following
supplementary questions from the tribunal and complaints by Justice Reddy, the
parties were given a further opportunity to make submissions on the issues in dispute

and further hearings were held on 9 and 10 January 2002.

During the course of the arbitration, Coal India applied to the ICC to have the
Tribunal reconstituted on the basis of apprehension of bias. The ICC refused the

request.

A majority of the arbitrators (Messrs Abrahamson and Morling) rendered an award on

27 May 2002 (the “Award”)? in which they held, inter alia:

(a) the Coal Preparation Plant produced 172,749 tonnes less than the production

target and, as such, Coal India was entitled to a penalty of A$969,060;

(b) the performance of the Coal Preparation Plant and the Coal Handling Plant

were not such as to constitute a total failure of consideration;
(c) White was entitled to a Coal Handling Plant bonus of A$2.28 million;
(d) White was entitled to recover the A$2.77 million Bank Guarantee;
(e) in total, White was entitled to an award of A$4.08 million.

Justice Reddy provided a dissenting opinion in which he found in favour of Coal
India. Mr Abrahamson provided a further note attached to the Award in which he

responded to the comments of Justice Reddy.

On 6 September 2002, Coal India applied to the High Court at Calcutta to have the
Award set aside on the basis of 30 claimed grounds of review (under the relevant
sections of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996).> White was not made
aware of this application until early October 2002. The Calcutta High Court granted

Coal India leave to apply and ordered the matter returnable on 14 November 2002.

On 11 September 2002, White applied to the High Court at New Delhi to have the

Award enforced. On 13 September 2002, the Registry of the Delhi High Court

? A copy of the Award is Exhibit 4 to the Notice of Arbitration.

*In consequence of its application to have the Award set aside, Coal India has not paid White the amounts ordered to
be paid in the Award. The decision to seek to set aside the Award was that of Coal India in which the GOI played no

part.

cleared the application for hearing, and on 16 September 2002, the matter was listed

for 17 September 2002.

On 17 September 2002, White’s application was heard in the Delhi High Court. The
Delhi High Court ordered that Coal India be given notice of the petition, and at the
request of White for a short return date, the matter was made returnable for 27

November 2002.

On 23 September 2002, White served Coal India with notice of the application in the

High Court at New Delhi and filed an affidavit of service in the Delhi High Court.

On 4 October 2002, White received notice from Coal India advising of its application

to the High Court at Calcutta to have the Award set aside.

On 24 October 2002, White filed an application in the Supreme Court of India to
transfer Coal India’s application from the Calcutta High Court to the Delhi High
Court. In addition, White applied for an order that the Calcutta High Court

proceedings be stayed.

White subsequently filed an application before the Registrar of the Supreme Court of
India to have the transfer petition listed for mentioning before the Chief Justice in
order to request a hearing before 14 November 2002 (being the next hearing date for

the Calcutta High Court proceeding).

The Supreme Court of India heard the transfer petition and application for an ex-parte
stay on 29 October 2002. The Court made an order that it had taken the matter on
board and, in the meantime, ordered that the proceedings in the Calcutta High Court
be stayed. The Court further ordered that Coal India file its reply to the transfer
petition within four weeks.

the Court stay the proceedings. The Delhi High Court did not stay the proceedings
and directed Coal India to file a short reply within three weeks, before 19 December
2002. The Court further ordered White to file a rejoinder to the reply before the next
date of hearing. The Court ordered that the matter be listed for hearing on 14

February 2003.

On or around 9 December 2002, Coal India filed an affidavit in reply to the transfer

petition in the Supreme Court of India.

On 16 December 2002, the transfer petition was heard in the Supreme Court,

however, the hearing was adjourned by the Court for two weeks.

On 2 January 2003, Coal India’s application to have the Award set aside was heard in
the Calcutta High Court. The Calcutta High Court was advised that the Supreme
Court of India had ordered that the Calcutta proceedings be stayed. The Calcutta
High Court adjourned the proceedings with directions that Coal India’s application

resume after the Supreme Court had disposed of the transfer petition.

On 6 January 2003, the transfer petition was heard in the Supreme Court of India.
White requested permission to file a rejoinder affidavit in those proceedings. The
Court agreed and White filed a rejoinder affidavit during the proceedings. The
Supreme Court then adjourned the matter and ordered that it be listed for hearing after

one week.

On 20 January 2003, the transfer petition was heard in the Supreme Court of India.

At that time, the court advised that it was inclined to dismiss the petition, whereupon

White withdrew the transfer petition.

On 14 February 2003, White’s petition to enforce the Award was heard in the Delhi
High Court. Coal India requested the court to stay the proceedings and further
requested that it be given additional time in which to file its reply. The Delhi High
Court granted Coal India one final opportunity to comply and ordered Coal India to
file a reply within three weeks, by 8 March 2003. The court ordered White to file a
rejoinder two weeks after Coal India had filed its reply. On the insistence of White
for a short return date, the court posted the matter for arguments on 28 May 2003.
Coal India further advised the Delhi High Court that it would be filing an application
to stay the Delhi High Court proceedings until the proceedings in the Calcutta High

Court were decided. Coal India did not file a reply within the stipulated timeframe.

On or around 10 March 2003, White applied to the Calcutta High Court to have Coal

India’s application rejected.

On 22 March 2003, White applied to the Delhi High Court to have Coal India’s right
to file objections and a reply dismissed on the basis that Coal India had failed to file

its reply within the stipulated timeframe.

On 24 March 2003, the Calcutta High Court heard White’s application to have Coal
India’s application to set aside the Award rejected. The court directed Coal India to
file a reply to White’s application by 16 April 2003. The court further ordered White
to file a rejoinder by 2 May 2003. The court listed the matter for hearing and

arguments on 5 May 2003.

On 31 March 2003, White’s application to dismiss Coal India’s right to file a reply

was listed for hearing in the Delhi High Court for 3 April 2003. At the hearing on 3

April 2003, Coal India requested a further two weeks to file a reply, which the court
granted as a final opportunity. The court further ordered that White file a rejoinder

two weeks thereafter and posted the matter for arguments on 20 May 2003.

On 21 April 2003, Coal India filed its reply in the Delhi High Court and on 22 April
2003, applied for an urgent stay of the Delhi High Court proceedings pending disposal
of the proceedings in the Calcutta High Court. The Delhi High Court heard Coal
India’s reply on 20 May 2003. During the hearing, Coal India requested the court to
hear arguments on its application to stay the Delhi proceedings. White contested the
application for a stay and filed a reply. In view of the pending proceedings in the
Calcutta High Court, the Delhi High Court posted the matter for arguments on 8
August 2003. White filed an affidavit in opposition to Coal India’s reply to White’s

enforcement application on 5 August 2003.

On 21 April 2003, Coal India filed in the Calcutta High Court an affidavit in
opposition to White’s application to prevent the Award being set aside. The Calcutta
High Court ordered the matter returnable on or around 20 May 2003. White filed a

rejoinder to Coal India’s affidavit on or around 20 May 2003.

On or around 17 November 2003, the Calcutta High Court heard White’s application
to dismiss Coal India’s petition to set aside the Award. A single judge of the Calcutta

High Court rejected White’s application on 19 November 2003.

On 15 December 2003, White appealed the decision of the single judge of the
Calcutta High Court before the Division Bench of the Civil Appellate Division of the
High Court at Calcutta. The appeal was heard on 22 December 2003. White filed
written submissions during these proceedings. This appeal was dismissed by the
Calcutta High Court on 7 May 2004.

On 28 January 2004, the Delhi High Court directed Coal India to file any objections
as to the enforceability of the Award within three weeks, before 18 February 2004.
Coal India did not file its objections by 18 February 2004 and, on 11 May 2004,
sought further time in which to do so. The Delhi High Court granted Coal India a
final extension of three weeks, until 1 June 2004. Coal India did not meet this further
deadline and on 7 July 2004, White filed an urgent application to dismiss Coal India’s

right to file any objections.

On 31 July 2004, White appealed the decision of the Appellate Division of the
Calcutta High Court to the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court heard the
application on 29 September 2004 and ordered that the appeal be heard together with

another matter, Civil Appeal No 339 of 2003.

On 9 March 2006, the Delhi High Court ordered a stay of the Delhi proceedings. On
1 April 2006, Coal India applied to the Delhi High Court to correct the error in the

case number and title noted on the certified copy of the Order of 9 March 2006.

On 8 January 2007, the Supreme Court called White’s appeal for an early hearing.
However, the office report stated that Civil Appeal No 339 of 2003 was not ready.
White advised the court that Civil Appeal No. 339 had settled. The Supreme Court
ordered the office to check and report back and listed the matter for hearing after two

weeks.

On 3 April 2007, the Supreme Court of India ordered that the appeal be listed for 24
April 2007 with Civil Appeal No 7019 of 2005. The Appeal was heard by two judges
of the Supreme Court on 16 January 2008, who referred the matter to another bench

of three judges, presided by the Chief Justice of India.

Despite several attempts made by the Indian legal counsel of White to mention the

matter orally, the matter has not yet been heard by the Supreme Court.

On 10 December 2009, White wrote to India contending that by the action of its
courts, and by the actions of Coal India, it had breached the provisions of Articles 3,
4, 7 and 9 of the BIT. White asserted claims exceeding A$10 million for loss and
damages. It offered to meet with India to negotiate an amicable resolution of the
matter within the six-month negotiation period provided for in Article 13.2 of the BIT
to negotiate the disputes between the parties. A further letter seeking negotiations
between the parties was sent on 30 March 2010. No response to either of these letters

was received from India.

On 2 June 2010, White was informed by Indian counsel that its Supreme Court appeal
was at that stage, item number 93 on the list. At the time of the arbitral hearing in
London, no date had been set for the appeal and no reasonable estimate of when the

appeal might be heard was available.

4. WHITE’S CASE

41

4.1.1

4.1.2

White Industries is an Investor in India
Jn summary, White says that it is an “investor” and has made an “investment”

pursuant to the BIT.

It submits that the correct approach to be adopted by the Tribunal in assessing
whether an “investment” has been made is to consider the plain and ordinary meaning
of the words used in the BIT and to determine whether the matters relied on by White
as constituting an “investment” satisfy the definition employed in the BIT. If this
approach is adopted, the only conclusion that can follow is that White has made a
relevant “investment” for the purposes of the BIT.

25

4.1.3. In the alternative, White argues that even if the test for an “investment” that was
developed by the Salini tribunal’ is adopted (as India appears to contend ought to

apply), it has, nevertheless, made an “investment”.

Investor defined by BIT

4.1.4 Article 1 of the BIT provides that an “investor” may be a company. A “company” is
defined in that article as including any corporation that is “incorporated, constituted,
set up or duly organised” under the laws of a Contracting Party (i.e., Australia or

India). White says that it satisfies this definition.

4.1.5 White notes that India has not disputed that it is a company incorporated in Australia.
India’s argument that White is not an “investor” for the purposes of the BIT is based

solely on the assertion that it has not made an “investment” under the BIT.

Investment defined by BIT
4.1.6 In these circumstances, White submits that India’s jurisdictional defence will be
disposed of if the Tribunal concludes that White has made an investment. As to this,

White says that its investment pursuant to the BIT comprises:
(a) all of its contractual rights under the Contract;

(b) all of its rights in relation to the Bank Guarantee; and
(c) all of its rights under the Award.

4.1.7 White notes that “investment” has been defined in the BIT in the broadest terms.

* Salini Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.p.A v Kingdom of Morroco, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on
Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001 (“Salini”’).

26

 

 

4.1.8

4.19

Article 1 of the BIT defines “investment” as follows:

“investment” means every kind of asset, including intellectual
property rights, invested by an investor of one Contracting
Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in
accordance with the laws and investment policies of that
Contracting Party, and in particular, though not exclusively,
includes:

(i) moveable and immovable property as well as other rights such as
mortgages, liens, or pledges;

(ii) shares, stocks, bonds and debentures and any other form or
participation in a company;

(iii) right to money or to any performance having a financial value,
contractual or otherwise;

(iv) business concessions and any other rights required to conduct
economic activity and having economic value conferred by law or
under a contract, including rights to search for, extract and utilise oil
and other minerals;

 

(v) activities iated with i such as the organisation and
operation of business facilities, the acquisition, exercise and
disposition of property rights including intellectual property rights”
(emphasis added as by White)

White contends that the plain meaning of the words used in this definition (in
particular, paragraphs (iii) and (iv)) encompass its rights under the Contract (including
the Bank Guarantee). The Contract is said plainly to have conferred on White the
tight to “money” (for the purposes of paragraph (iii)), as well as providing it with the
right to “conduct economic activity” (for the purposes of paragraph (iv)). White
submits that the mere fact that its obligations under the Contract are summarised in a
section titled “Provision of Services” is not determinative of whether the performance
of its obligations under the Contract constitute an “investment” for the purposes of the

BIT.

In any event, White asserts that its commitment under the Contract extended far

beyond the provision of equipment and technical services (to, for example, the

27

|

4.1.10

4.1.11

41.12

provision of guarantees). It notes that tribunals have regularly found that the supply

of services and equipment can constitute an “investment” under a BIT.

White says that India’s reliance on the Salini test, as summarised by Douglas in The
International Law of Investment Claims (Cambridge, 2009) is not applicable in this
case. This is because that test was developed in order to determine whether an
“investment” had been made for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. The present
case, however, is not subject to the ICSID Convention and all the cases cited by India

are ICSID Decisions.

Moreover, the so-called Salini test arose out of the double jurisdictional requirement
which is said by some tribunals to arise in ICSID cases under the ICSID convention.

The Salini tribunal referred to this double jurisdictional requirement as follows:

“[The Tribunal’s] jurisdiction depends upon the existence of an
investment within the meaning of the bilateral treaty as well as
that of the Convention, in accordance with the case law. The
ratione materiae test applied by some ICSID tribunals was
summarised in Joy Mining Machinery Limited v the Arab
Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award on
Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, where the tribunal held that:

“.. the project in question should have a certain
duration, a regularity of profit and return, an
element of risk, a substantial commitment and that
it should constitute a significant contribution to the
host State’s development.”

White contends that this test is specific to arbitrations under the ICSID Convention.
This is said to have been confirmed by the Mytilineos tribunal which concluded:
“However, this latter ratione materiae test for the existence of
an investment in the sense of Art 25 of the ICSID Convention is
one specific to the Convention and does not apply in the context

of ad hoc arbitration provided for in BITs as an alternative to
ICSID.

28

In the present ad hoc arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules
one would therefore have to conclude that the only
requirements that have to be fulfilled in order to confer ratione
materiae on this Tribunal are those under the BIT.””

White’s Investment Meets Salini Test

4.1.13

4.1.14

4.1.15

4.1.16

In the alternative, in the event that the Tribunal considers that the Salini test ought to
be applied in this case, White argues that it has nonetheless made a relevant

“investment” measured by this standard.

As regards “duration”, White points out that the coal mine was to be developed over
five and half years from the Contract coming into force. The Contract was itself was
of six years duration; the calculation period which determined White’s bonus or
penalty amounted to six years; and Coal India had the potential right to retain some or

all of the Bank Guarantees for many years.
With respect to the “risk”, element, the Salini Tribunal concluded that:

“A construction that stretches out over many years, for which
the total cost cannot be established with certainty in advance,
creates an obvious risk for the Contract. n6

Other matters which are said to demonstrate the risk undertaken by White include the

fact that:

(a) it was only entitled to be paid a fixed fee, regardless of the expense it incurred

over the term of the Contract;

° Salini at para 56.

29

 

4.1.17

4.1.18

4.1.19

4.1.20

(b) it was vulnerable to the risk of the draw-down of a large amount on the Bank
Guarantees if it failed to satisfy its obligations under the Contract (and to the

tisk of an unlawful retention of the bank guarantees by Coal India);

(c) it was liable to pay Coal India a substantial penalty; and

(d) it had a substantial bonus at risk.

A regards the requirement that the investment make a contribution to the Host State’s
development, White says that this fact is no longer accepted in investment treaty
arbitration. Nevertheless, it notes that the Piparwar project was initiated by the GOL
in 1986 as part of a policy decision to increase domestic coal production from 160
million to 400 million tonnes per year. The study carried out by White in 1987 to
improve the productive capability of the Piparwar project was used by Coal India in
support of its application to India’s Public Investment Board for approval to proceed

with the project.

White notes that the project was only developed and finalised with the approval of the
GOI. In the light of the GOI’s commitment to the project, any submission by the
Republic that it did not intend that the project would make a contribution to its

development cannot properly be accepted.

White contends that the substantial nature of its commitment and of its contribution to
the India economy is also demonstrated by the fact that it financed the performance of
the project and provided substantial funds to Coal India by way of its numerous bank

guarantees.

White also points out that it maintained a technical staff of approximately 34
employees at the Piparwar mine site, an office in Calcutta with a full-time

30

administrative staff of four, an office in Ranchi with a full-time administrative staff of
three and an office in Piparwar with full-time administrative staff of five. It also

provided valuable know-how in the implementation of the project by:

(a) a technology transfer to Coal India for the development of the project;
(b) planning and designing of the mine;

(c) training approximately 150 Coal India employees in India and Australia;
(d) designing and developing the Coal India preparation and handling plants;
(e) supervising the works; and

(f) making recommendations on equipment and additional work required.

4.1.21 Two particularly significant items of technology transfer are said to have been

White’s “Mobile In-Pit Crushing and Conveying” technology and its coal washery.

4.1.22 In all of these circumstances, White submits that it made an investment in India for

the purpose of the Salini test.

Provision of Bank Guarantees Constitute an Investment

4.1.23 White argues that its provision of the Bank Guarantees, standing alone, constitute an
investment under the BIT. White committed its own funds in issuing tens of millions
of Australian dollars in guarantees to Coal India pursuant to the Contract. These
Bank Guarantees are plainly captured by the broad scope of the BIT, specifically
Article 1 (c)(iii), being a right to money. White notes that the Bank Guarantees also

satisfy each of the Salini factors.

The Award Constitutes an Investment
4.1.24 White also says that its rights under the Contract (including in the guarantees) are now
| represented in the Award. Article (c)(iii) of the BIT expressly includes as a

31

 

|
:
|

4.1.25

4.1.26

4.1.27

4.1.28

“investment” a “right to money or any performance having a financial value,
contractual or otherwise.” On the plain meaning of these words, this includes the

Award.

White does not allege that its rights under the Award represent an investment in itself,
but rather that the Award is a part of the original investment, as found by the tribunal
in Saipem:

“the rights embodied in the ICC Award were not created by the

Award but arise out of the Contract. The ICC Award

crystallized the parties’ rights and obligations under the

original Contract”
And while the Saipem tribunal left open the question of whether the award was an
investment for the purpose of the relevant BIT, White asserts the question was

answered definitively by the Chevron tribunal which found that “a claim to money” as

provided in the US-Ecuador BIT captured an arbitral award.®

White argues that the Chevron decision, and others to similar effect, represent the
only logical approach to a consideration of arbitral awards under BITs. If the rights
under the Contract and the Bank Guarantees are found to be an “investment” for the
purposes of the BIT, the only conclusion that can logically follow is that the Award,
which is in respect of those very same rights, is part of or is a continuation of that

investment.

If India’s submissions were correct (that an award cannot constitute part of an

investment), then a host State would be able to expropriate an investor’s award

4.2.3

against the State (by having its courts set the award aside) in respect of an investment
which would otherwise be protected by a BIT, without the investor having recourse

under a BIT for those actions. That, it is said, cannot be right.

Tribunal’s Jurisdiction over Acts and Omissions of Coal India
White contends that India’s assertion that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over

the acts and omissions of Coal India is misconceived. This is because:

(a) Coal India is a government instrumentality;

(b) India was in a position to (and did in fact), control and direct Coal India’s

actions; and

(c) India has always had the opportunity to remedy Coal India’s ongoing breach
of the Contract and the Award.

White relies on Article 8 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally

Wrongful Acts issued by the International Law Commission in 2001 (“ILC

Articles”) which provides:

“Conduct directed or controlled by a State.

The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be

considered an act of a State under international law if the

person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions

of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying

out the conduct.”
White contends that Coal India was and is “subject to the control of the State” by way
of India’s appointment of board members and its share ownership. White points to
Coal India’s Articles of Association which vest in the President of India the power to
appoint the Chairman, determine the terms and conditions of his/her appointment,

appoint the Vice Chairman, Managing Director, whole-time Functional Directors and

other directors in consultation with the Chairman, and to appoint the Directors

33

4.2.4

4.2.5

4.2.6

4.27

representing the government without any consultation with the Chairman. Further,
the Chairman, Managing Director and other whole-time Functional Directors are
appointed for a period of five years or until further instructions from the Government
of India, whichever occurs earlier. Moreover, two of Coal India’s Directors hold
office by virtue of being officials of the Government of India’s Ministry of Coal.
Such Directors cease to hold office once they no longer serve as Ministers of the

Ministry of Coal.

White says that these circumstances show that India was at all times able to control
and direct Coal India. Moreover, the factual history shows that India did, in fact,

regularly exercise its control over Coal India to direct its day-to-day operations.

White contends that India’s close involvement in bringing about the Contract between
Coal India and White, and India’s direct involvement in the Contract by reason of
India’s Public Investment Board’s approval for Coal India to proceed with the project
is indicative of such a close relationship between India and Coal India as to show that
Coal India was acting “on the instructions of, or under the direction of” India, in

accordance with Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

Relying on the decisions in Wintershall A.P., et al v Government of Qatar (Partial
Award on Liability, 5 February 1988, (1989) 28 ILM 795), Noble Ventures, Inc v
Romania (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/011, Award, 12 October 2005), and EnCana
Corporation v Republic of Ecuador (LCIA Case UN3481, Award, 3 February 2006),
White says that it cannot sensibly be contended that the acts of Coal India, should not

be attributable to India.

As regards India’s submission that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction rationai temporae
over the acts and omissions of Coal India because the acts and omissions complained

34

lL.

42.8

4.2.9

4.2.10

4.2.11

of occurred prior to 28 June 1999, before the BIT entered into force on 4 May 2000,

White says that this is incorrect for two reasons.

First, the Tribunal clearly has jurisdiction rationai temporae over Coal India’s
improper retention of the Bank Guarantee as the retention is of a continuous character,

in accordance with Article 14 (2) of the ILC Articles. Article 14 provides:

“Extension in time of the breach of an international obligation

1. the breach of an international obligation by an act by a
State not having a continuous character occurs at the
moment when the act performed, even if its effects continue.

N

the breach of an international obligation by an act of a State

having a continuous character extends over the entire period

during which the act continues and remains not in

conformity with the international obligation.”

White notes that the improper retention of the Bank Guarantee persisted from well
before 4 May 2000 (when the BIT came into force), and continues to the present day.

Having regard to the fact that the improper taking is or constitutes a “continuous act”,

India’s purported reliance on the non-retroactivity principle is without merit.

Second, and of greater relevance, White argues that the issue here is not one of
retroactivity. This is because there is nothing in the BIT which requires a dispute to

have arisen after the entry into force of the BIT.

Under Article 2(1), the BIT applies as long as there are “investments” existing at the
time of entry into force. The BIT’s temporal restrictions refer to “investments” and
not disputes. Thus, the BIT covers any dispute as long as it is a dispute arising out of

or relating to an “investment” existing at the time of its entry into force.

4.2.12 With respect to India’s submissions that White’s claims are contractual and, thus,
inadmissible, White says that India had and continues to have the opportunity, means
and legal obligation to remedy Coal India’s retention of the Bank Guarantee. Thus,
India’s failure to correct Coal India’s retention of the Bank Guarantee amounts to an
exercise of sovereign authority. India had an obligation to ensure that Coal India only
called upon the Bank Guarantee when it was proper to do so and its failure to exercise
its supervisory function over Coal India properly is the relevant exercise of sovereign

authority for these purposes.'°

43 Breach of Article 3(2) of the BIT

43.1 Article 3(2) of the BIT provides:
“Investments or investors of each contracting Party shall at all
times be accorded fair and equitable treatment.”
4.3.2 White contends that India failed to afford fair and equitable treatment to its
investment as required by Article 3 (2) of the BIT, in that (a) White has been subject
to a denial of justice; (b) India has frustrated White’s legitimate expectations; and (d)

Coal India has improperly taken and retained White’s Bank Guarantee.

Denial of Justice
4.3.3 White says that it has long been recognised that a denial of justice may give rise to a
breach of the fair and equitable treatment requirement in international law (see, for

example, Lowen Group Inc v United States of America, 7 ICSID Rep 421).
4.3.4 White contends, in summary, that the matters which give rise to a denial of justice in
'° The fact that India exercised control over the management and strategic direction of Coal India, in particular by the

composition and lack of independence of the Board of Directors also means that India should be held legally
responsible for the improper retention of the Bank Guarantee.

43.5

4.3.6

4.3.7

this case are:

(a) The Indian courts’ improper exercise of jurisdiction in asserting they have the

power to set aside the Award;

(b) The Indian courts’ shocking delay in dealing with the enforcement of the
Award (i.e., a failure to provide justice to White by allowing the enforcement
process - and the disputed setting aside proceedings - to continue for over nine

years without any realistic end in sight); and

(c) Coal India’s improper call upon the Bank Guarantee and its improper retention

of funds.

White points to the fact that it has been waiting over nine years to establish whether
the Indian Courts, as a matter of Indian law, have properly exercised jurisdiction over

the setting aside of proceedings.

It argues that the relevant standard for denial of justice must be informed by the
obligations voluntarily accepted as binding by India under the Convention of the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (“New York
Convention” or “Convention”). By reason of Article III and V of the New York
Convention, and in the light of its object and purpose, there is a strong presumption in
favour of enforcement of arbitral awards. Under the New York Convention, an
arbitral award must be recognised as binding and enforced by a Contracting State,
subject only to limited exceptions. In signing the New York Convention, India has
accepted that this is the standard of conduct to be applied by its courts for the

enforcement of awards.

White says that the New York Convention establishes the requirement that an award

37

 

| _..

4.3.8

43.9

4.3.10

43.11

must be enforced subject to certain limited exceptions. In turn, the relevant inquiries
that may be conducted by the courts of Contracting States that have been asked to
enforce such awards are confined. Thus, at international law, the courts of India are
not entitled to treat such enforcement in the same manner as they would a hearing of a
matter that has been brought at first instance for the India courts. In effect, by failing
to hear the matter within a reasonable period, India has failed to decide for or against
the enforcement of the Award held by White during the period of over nine years, in a
matter in which the India courts are necessarily allowed only limited jurisdiction. It
follows that India has failed to conform to the required standard of justice under

international law and its conduct constitutes a denial of justice.

White also says that it is a breach of India’s obligation under the New York
Convention and international law for its domestic courts (which are not the seat of the

arbitration), to purport to have jurisdiction to set aside an award.

In practical terms, White contends that it has had its enforcement application held in
abeyance for over nine years pending the resolution of the jurisdictional dispute.
There is no evidence to suggest that the matters will be dealt with expeditiously in the
near future. Thus, by preventing White from enforcing its Award in the courts of
India in a fair and reasonably timely manner, India has denied White fair and

equitable treatment.

As regards India’s argument that “a State can only be held liable for a denial of justice
when it has not remedied that denial domestically”, White says that where the essence
of a claim for denial of justice includes the delay of the State’s courts, there is no

requirement in international law for a claimant to exhaust local remedies.

White quotes Chittharajan Amerasinghe as the authority for this proposition:

38

 

 

4.3.12

43.13

4.3.14

“undue delay in the administration of justice has been held to

be a good reason for not exhausting local remedies. This

exception may be closely related to the general exception based

on obvious futility but it is better considered separately, as

delay may not always signify that there is a clear indication

that the alien or claimant may not succeed after a lapse of time.

However, undue delay in administration of justice is regarded

as a denial of justice in itself and it is certainly one which does

not require any further exhaustion of local remedies.”"'
With respect to India’s contention that “the delay of which White Industries now
complains is largely attributable to White Industries’ own litigation strategy”, White
says that its application to enforce the Award was not a reaction to Coal India’s
application to set aside. Rather, White was unaware of Coal India’s application at the

time it filed its own application to enforce.

White also argues that it was right to challenge the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High
Court to set aside a foreign award because, as an international matter, the Indian
domestic courts cannot properly set aside a foreign award. White, thereafter, initiated
its appeal to the Supreme Court in response to the internationally wrongful assertion

of jurisdiction by the Calcutta High Court.

White says that the bulk of the delay experienced in this matter stems from the
inability of the Indian Supreme Court to hear and determine finally a matter that ought
to have been determined promptly. This delay, (namely, over seven years), in failing
to come to a view, one way or another, as to whether the Calcutta High Court has
jurisdiction to set aside a foreign award is itself an unacceptable delay which amounts
to a breach of India’s BIT obligations. That such a simple appeal has still not been

heard or determined is sufficient to shock or surprise a sense of judicial propriety.

43.17

As regards India’s defence that White knew, or ought to have known, that Indian law
allows challenges to arbitral awards rendered outside India, White says that a State
may not justify its breach of its international obligations by pointing to its domestic
law. Article 3 of the ILC Articles states that:

“the characterization of an act of a State as internationally

wrongful is governed by international law. Such

characterization is not affected by the characterization of the

same act as lawful by internal law.”
White argues that this fundamental principle of international law is reflected in Article
27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (“Vienna Convention”)
which provides that “[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as

justification for its failure to perform a treaty”.

White also points out that the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in
Article 3(2) of the BIT is expressed without qualification. Thus, the resulting
protection against denial of justice is unqualified, including by reference to

“domestic” law.

Frustration of White’s Legitimate Expectations

4.3.18

4.3.19

White also submits that it has long been recognised that the “fair and equitable”
treatment requirement in international law requires the host State to provide to
investments treatment that does not affect the legitimate expectations which the

investor had at the time of making the investment (see, for instance, Tecnicas

Medioambientales Tecmed v United Mexican States (2004) 32 ILM 133 (“Tecmed’’)).

The matters which are said to give rise to a breach of White’s legitimate expectations

can be summarised as follows:

40

@

the provisions of the New York Convention are binding upon India as a matter

of international law'?.

the Contract which was entered into on 28 September 1989, called for disputes
to be settled by ICC arbitration;

at the time of the investment, White had a legitimate expectation that, if an
arbitration arose, India would abide by its treaty obligations concerning any

resulting award pursuant to the New York Convention; and

despite White’s legitimate expectations at the time of making the investment,
and contrary to its obligations pursuant to the New York Convention, India
has allowed its courts to assert jurisdiction to hear Coal India’s application to
set aside the Award. As noted above, it is a breach of the New York
Convention, and international law, for a State’s domestic courts - which are
not the seat of the arbitration - to purport to have jurisdiction to set aside an

award.

43.20 There was a legitimate expectation on the part of White that India would afford justice

to White by allowing it to enforce the Award, in the courts of India, in a fair and

reasonably timely manner.

4.3.21 As a result of the manner in which the Indian courts have dealt (or failed to deal) with

the enforcement of the Award, White’s legitimate expectation that India, as a party to

the New York Convention, would apply the Convention properly and in accordance

with international standards, has been frustrated. Consequently, White has been

denied fair and equitable treatment.

Coal India’s Improper Taking and Retention of the Bank Guarantee

Poni3h uly 1960, India became a signatory to the New York Convention. The New York Convention entered into
force in India on 11 October 1960. India’s ratification was subject to certain reservations, however, these are not
relevant to the present case.

41

4.3.22

4.3.23

4.3.24

4.3.25

White says that Coal India’s conduct regarding the Bank Guarantee engages the

responsibility of India under Article 3(2.).

First, Coal India was never entitled to take or retain the Bank Guarantee. In its Award
(at page 45), the ICC Tribunal concluded that White had met its performance targets
such that it was entitled to a bonus payment from Coal India in excess of any
applicable penalties as well as the return of A$2,772,640 taken by Coal India under
the Bank Guarantee. It follows, White asserts, that Coal India wrongly drew upon the
Bank Guarantee. The improper nature of this behaviour is said to be aggravated by
the fact that Coal India has continued to retain the Bank Guarantee even in the face of
the ICC’s Tribunal’s award against it. The conduct of Coal India is attributable to

India for the reasons outlined above.

Second, the failure of India to exercise proper supervision of Coal India and thereby
to correct this unlawful retention constitutes conduct in breach of the fair and
equitable treatment standard. In essence, White says that India has failed to use due
diligence in ensuring respect by Coal India for the fundamental requirements of the

fair and equitable treatment standard.

White contends that these two acts are inconsistent with the obligation of India to deal
with the investor in good faith. The initial taking of the Bank Guarantee was not in
good faith because, on the facts found by the ICC Tribunal, Coal India lacked a
proper factual basis for taking the Bank Guarantee. In any event, there can be no
doubt that the continued retention of the Bank Guarantee after the making of the ICC
Award, including the failure of India to exercise proper supervision by requiring Coal
India to pay the damages required by the Award and return the Bank Guarantee funds,

is entirely at odds with the most fundamental requirements of good faith and fair

42

4.3.26

44

4.4.1

44.2

4.43

dealing.

Third, the retention of the Bank Guarantee is arbitrary in that it is inconsistent with
reasonable, principled conduct. Such behaviour cannot be characterised as even-
handed or just conduct of the kind required by the fair and equitable treatment
standard in the circumstances of the present case. Coal India took the Bank
Guarantee because it could and when an ICC Tribunal found that Coal India was not

entitled to take or keep the Bank Guarantee, it simply ignored the decision.

Breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT
White contends that India has breached its obligations under Article 4 (2) of the BIT
because it has treated White’s investment on a less favourable basis than treatment

afforded to investments of investors of a third country.

Article 4 (2) of the BIT - a “most favoured nation” clause - provides that:

“a Contracting Party shall at all times treat investments in its
own territory on a basis no less favourable than that accorded
to investments of investors of any third country”.

White refers to Article 4 (5) of the Agreement Between the Republic of India and the
State of Kuwait for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 27

November 2001, (“Sndia-Kuwait BIT”) which provides that:

“each Contracting State shall maintain a favourable
environment for investments in its territory by investors of the
other Contracting State. Each Contracting State shall in
accordance with its applicable laws and regulations provide
effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with
respect to investments and ensure to investors of the other
Contracting State, the right of access to its courts of justice,
administrative tribunals and agencies, and all other bodies
exercising adjudicatory authority, and the right to employ
persons of their choice, for the purpose of the assertion of
claims and the enforcement of rights with respect to their
investments.”

43

44.4 White notes that almost identical wording appears in Article II (7) of the Treaty
between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 27 August 1993 (“US-

Ecuador BIT”):

“each party shall provide effective means of asserting claims
and enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment
agreements and investment authorizations”.

4.4.5 White relies on the conclusions of the tribunal in Chevron - Texaco v Ecuador’? that

Article II (7):

“... constitutes a lex specialis and not a mirror statement of the
law on denial of justice ... a distinct and potentially less-
demanding test is applicable under this provision as compared
to denial of justice under customary international law ...” (at
242, 244)

“For any ‘means’ of asserting claims or enforcing rights to be
effective, it must not be subject to indefinite or undue delay.
Undue delay in effect amounts to a denial of access to those
means .... The Ecuadorian legal system must thus ... provide
foreign investors with means of enforcing legitimate rights
within a reasonable amount of time ... some of the factors that
may be considered are the complexity of the case, the
behaviour of the litigants involved, the significance of the
interests at stake in the case, and the behaviour of the courts
themselves.” (at 250)

“The tribunal ultimately concludes that the Ecuadorian courts
have had ample time to render a judgement in each of the seven
cases and have failed to do so.” (at 262)

“The question of whether effective means have been provided
to the Claimants for the assertion of their claims and
enforcement of their rights is ultimately to be measured against
an objective, international standard.” (at 263)
44.6 Against this background, White contends that nine years for the enforcement of an

international arbitration award in a country which is a party to the New York

to

4.5.2

4.6.1

Convention is an unacceptable delay by objective and international standards. Here,
the matter is not complex, and White has pursued the enforcement of the Award with
vigour. Accordingly, India’s failure to enforce the Award constitutes a breach of the
“effective means” obligation under Article 4(2) of the BIT, under which Claimant is

entitled to the benefit of Article 4 (5) of the Kuwait-India BIT.

Breach of Article 7 of the BIT
White argues that India has breached its obligation under Article 7 of the BIT not to
expropriate the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party except

against compensation prescribed by the BIT.

By entertaining the application of Coal India to set aside the Award, the courts of
India have asserted jurisdiction to set aside an international arbitration award made in
another country in breach of international law (including the New York Convention)
under which an international award may be set aside only by the courts of the place

where the award was made.

In addition, the effect of the Indian courts’ delays in dealing with White’s application
to enforce the award has deprived White of the benefit of the Award and of its rights
to have the Award enforced in a manner consistent with India’s obligations under

international law, including the New York Convention.

Because the courts of India are an organ of the Republic of India, the delays
occasioned by the Indian courts constitute an expropriation which is attributable to the

Republic. White is thus entitled to receive compensation for this expropriation.

Breach of Article 9 of the BIT

White says that Coal India’s improper call on the Bank Guarantee and its improper

45

 

1

4.7

471

4.7.2

retention of those funds constitute a breach by India of its obligations under Article 9
of the BIT to permit all funds of an investor related to an investment to be transferred

freely without unreasonable delay and on a non-discriminatory basis.

Compensation is Due under the BIT

Based on the Chorzow Factory decision'*, White says it is entitled to be restored to
the position it would have enjoyed had the breach of the BIT not occurred. That is to
say, White would (a) have received the sums due to it under the Award; (b) not have
incurred the costs which it has incurred in pursuing litigation through the Indian
Courts; (c) not have incurred the costs which it has incurred in attempting to settle the

dispute with India; and (d) not have incurred the costs in bringing this arbitration.
White thus claims compensation as follows:
(a) the amount of A$4,085,180 payable under the Award;

(b) the amount of A$4,033,397.07, being interest (at the rate of 8% as set out in
the Award) from 24 March 1998 to 27 July 2010, on the Award (and
continuing at a rate of A $ 895.38 per day from 27 July 2010) until the date of

payment;

(c) the amount of US $84,000 payable under the Award for the fees and expenses
of the arbitrators (converted to Australian dollars as at the date of the Award),

being A $150,892;

(d) the amount of A$500,000 payable under the Award (for White’s costs in the

arbitration);

(e) the costs incurred by White in pursuing the Indian court proceedings,

settlement negotiations and this arbitration (such costs to be assessed); and
(f) interest on the amounts set out in (c), (d) and (e) above.

5. INDIA’S CASE
5.1 Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility

White is not a “Investor” / has no “Investment” in India

5.1.1 India says that Claimant has not discharged its burden of proving that this Tribunal
has jurisdiction rationae materiae in this case. Specifically, India argues that White is
not an “investor” with an “investment” in India that is entitled to the protections in the
BIT. What constitutes an “investment”, India asserts, must be determined from the
ordinary meaning of the term in the context of the BIT and having regard to its object
and purpose (as opposed to in the abstract).

5.1.2 India says that White misrepresents the writings of Zachary Douglas in suggesting
that he restricts his proposed definition of an “investment” to “investments” under the
ICSID Convention. Rather, Douglas sets out a more general test which is applicable
to all investment treaty claims. The applicable legal test as to what constitutes an
“investment” is said to be summarised by Douglas’ Rules 22 and 23:

“Rule 22: The legal materialization of an investment is the
acquisition of a bundle of rights in property that has the
characteristics of one or more of the categories of an
investment defined by the applicable investment treaty where
such property is situated in the territory of the host State or is
recognised by the rules of the host State’s private international
law to be situated in the host State or is created by the

municipal law of the host State.

Rules 23: The economic materialization of an investment
requires the commitment of resources to the economy of the

47

ee

host State by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in
expectation of a commercial return”.'°

5.1.3 India asserts that the pertinent elements of an “investment” have been defined in the
so-called Salini test (originally developed in relation to Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention). That test is said to identify four elements as indicative of an

“investment” for the purposes of the ICSID Convention:

(a) a contribution of money or other assets of economic value;
(b) a certain duration over which the project is implemented;
(c) a sharing of operational risks; and

(d) _ acontribution to the host state’s development.

5.1.4 India asserts that none of the categories of alleged “investment” relied on by White

meets these requirements

White’s Contractual Rights

5.1.5 India argues that the Contract was an ordinary commercial contract for the supply of

goods and services and as such, does not constitute an “investment”.

5.1.6 India says that such contracts do not satisfy the test found in Douglas, to the effect
that rights in personam do not generally qualify as an investment independently of

rights in rem. 16

5.1.7 Reliance is also placed on the tribunal’s decision in Malaysian Salvors v Malaysia

which held that the salvage contract in question there did not constitute an investment

'S Zachary Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (CUP, 209) V, p. 161.
*® Douglas, Chapter V, p. 161, Rule 24.

48

5.1.8

because:

’while the contract did provide some benefits to Malaysia, they
did not make a sufficient contribution to Malaysia’s economic
development to qualify as an ‘investment’ for the purposes of
Art. 1 (a) of the BIT”.!7

India contends that the requirement that the right in question be a right in rem stems
not from the terms of the BIT alone, but also from the ordinary meaning of the term
“investment” applying Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention. Using the ordinary
meaning of the term, the analysis of whether a contractual right can amount to an

“investment” must consider whether the contractual right in question gives rise to a

proprietary interest. As Douglas explains:

“Of all the investment categories considered ... it is a ‘claim to
money’ or ‘right to future income’ which generates the most
controversy in practice. There is clearly a significant degree of
overlap between each of these rights and an analysis of them
must grapple with an additional problem of distinguishing
between rights in rem capable of constituting an investment
pursuant to Rule 22 and simply contractual rights that are not.
The problem is the subject of a separate Rule 24 and much of
the discussion accompanying it is directly relevant to the
investment category now under consideration. Investment
securities confer a right in rem to a ‘claim for money’ and
therefore are capable of being a ‘investment’ pursuant to Rule
22. The category of ‘rights to money or future income’ tends to
feature in BITs where there is no separate reference to
investment securities, such as the Germany Model BIT. Insofar
as the category under consideration is introduced in the
Germany Model BIT as an ‘asset’, it would seem to follow that
there must be a proprietary foundation for any alleged
investment in the form of ‘claim to money or future income’ nis

 

5.1.9 India points out that White’s rights under Part I of the Contract were to payment; and

detailed provisions on advance payment, progress payment and final payments were

5.1.12

included in the Contract. Under Part II of the Contract, White had certain rights, most
notably the right to compensation in the form of fees for the development of the

project.

India contends that it follows, inexorably, that White does not have any rights under
the Contract or under the Bank Guarantee which can be described as rights which
have a “propriety foundation” and therefore that none of White’s rights are in rem.
India notes that this point has been addressed expressly by Justice Srikrishna, who
confirms that - as a matter of applicable Indian law - the rights created by the Contract

or the Bank Guarantee are not rights in rem.

India also argues that White’s purported “investment” does not satisfy the
requirement that White assumed an element of risk, which is recognised as a criterion
for an investor to be regarded as having made an “investment”’. This is because the
financing structure entered into by Coal India, White Industries, AUSTRADE and
EFIC - which enabled Coal India to enter into the transaction - meant that White bore

no risk in the Piparwar project, other than as to its own performance.

In sum, India asserts that White’s rights under the Contract cannot be considered an
“investment” because they do not satisfy the meaning of “investment” under the BIT,
as they are merely rights in personam without any proprietary foundation. Further,
White’s rights under the Contract do not meet the additional criteria which have been

accepted in arbitral case law as applying to the term “investment”.

White’s Rights in Relation to the Bank Guarantee

5.1.13

India contends that the starting point here is White’s admission that its alleged rights

50

 

5.1.14

under the Bank Guarantee are a “sub-set of the rights under the Contract”.”°
Accordingly, on White’s own case, the Bank Guarantees were not an independent
investment in their own right, but were part and parcel of the Contract. Thus, if, as

submitted above, the Contract was not an investment, neither were the Bank

Guarantees.

To the extent that White argues that the Bank Guarantees were independent assets
“invested” by it into India, this is said to be plainly wrong. The guarantee in question
is the CHP/CPP Performance Bank Guarantee. India argues that none of the Bank
Guarantees put in place by White provided it with any substantive rights. Rather, the
guarantees were issued in favour of Coal India so as to provide Coal India with the
guarantee that it would be entitled to immediate payment in case it believed that
White had defaulted on its obligations. At most, White’s right under the Bank
Guarantees was to ensure that no payment would be taken except in the contractually
stipulated circumstances which allowed Coal India to effect a draw under the Bank
Guarantees. However, there has never been any suggestion that these were breached
in any way or that the bank ought not to have effected payment to Coal India under
the Bank Guarantees. White’s real complaint is not that “its” Bank Guarantee has
been “improperly retained” or “expropriated”. Rather, it believes it is now entitled to
arefund of funds drawn down under the Bank Guarantee, not of the Bank Guarantee
itself which has long since expired. India notes that the Bank Guarantee expired
seven days after Coal India drew down A$2,772,640 on 24 March 1998. Thus, it
cannot be said that the expired guarantee has in any way been “retained” by Coal

India, let alone by India.

° Claimant’ s Memorial, para 1.7 and para. 1.101.

51

5.1.15 In sum, the contention by White that the Bank Guarantees constitute an investment
must be rejected. Such rights that White had thereunder were purely contractual in
personam rights and not rights in rem. Further, Bank Guarantees were constituted in
favour of Coal India, not White, and did not grant or create any substantive rights in

favour of White and were not an “asset” of White.

5.1.16 Reliance is also placed on the tribunal’s decision in Joy Mining Machinery v Egypt
where the claim, brought under the UK-Egypt BIT, related to performance guarantees
given by the claimant to an Egyptian state-controlled enterprise.” The Joy tribunal is
said to have held that the contract amounted to no more than an ordinary sales
contract on “normal commercial terms” which was to be distinguished from
investment activity, and the guarantees were no more an “investment” than the

contract itself.

White’s Rights under the Award

5.1.17 India states that White’s suggestion that the Saipem tribunal “determined that an ICC
Award was an investment for the purposes of the Italy-Bangladesh BIT” is completely

incorrect.

5.1.18 To the contrary, it points out that the Saipem tribunal expressly found that an arbitral

award was not an investment. As the tribunal explained:

“The Tribunal agrees ... that the rights arising out of the ICC
Award arise only indirectly from the investment. Indeed, the
opposite view would mean that the Award itself does constitute
an investment under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention,
which the Tribunal is not prepared to accept. vad

August 2004).

2 Saipem , para 113 (emphasis in original).

 

52

lL

5.1.19 India also relies on the ICSID tribunal’s decision in GEA Group AG v Ukraine which
ruled definitively that an ICC Award is not an “investment” for the purposes of
Article I of the Germany-Ukraine BIT (which is said to contain a similar definition to

Article I of the BIT). That tribunal held that:

“161. ... Whether tested against the criteria of Article I of the
BIT or Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the ICC Award -in
and of itself - cannot constitute an ‘investment’. Properly
analysed, it is a legal instrument, which provides for the
disposition of rights and obligations arising out of the
Settlement Agreement and Repayment Agreement (neither of
which was itself an “investment” ...).

162. even if - arguendo - the Settlement Agreement and
Repayment Agreement could somehow be characterised as
‘investments’ ... the Tribunal considers that the fact that the
Award rules upon rights and obligations arising out of an
investment does not equate the Award with the investment
itself. In the Tribunal’s view, the two remain analytically
distinct and the Award itself involves no contribution to, or
relevant economic activity within, Ukraine such as to fall -
itself - within the scope of Article II of the BIT or (if needed)
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention 02

5.1.20 India further says that the Award is plainly not an “asset ... invested ... [in India] ... .
As Douglas puts it, the Award does not satisfy the additional requirements for the
alleged “asset” to be an “investment”; there has been no additional commitment to the
resources of the host State and there has been no assumption of risk in expectation of

commercial return.

Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction over the Acts / Omissions of Coal India

5.1.21 India argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the acts and omissions

original).

of Coal India because:

(a) such acts are not attributable to India;
(b) the tribunal has no jurisdiction rationai temporis over such acts;

(c) White’s claims based on such acts are not admissible

As regards attribution, India notes that White has now conceded that it is not relying
on Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (“ILC Articles”), and
that the sole basis on which it seeks to contend that the acts of Coal India are
attributable to India is that provided in Article 8 of the ILC Articles (“Conduct

Directed or Controlled by the State”).
Article 8 provides:

“the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be
considered an act of State under international law if the person
or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or
under the direction or control of the State in carrying out the
conduct.”

With respect to White’s conclusion that:

“given the practical control which India has over Coal India,
and the history of India’s exercise of that control, it follows that
(at the relevant time), Coal India had such a close relationship
with India that Coal India could be said to have been acting

‘on the instructions of, or under direction of’ the Republic of
India, in accordance with Article 8 of the ILC Articles 23

India says that even if this was a correct factual assertion, this makes no difference.

This is because the test under Article 8 is not concerned with organisational structure

of the State agency, the manner of appointment of directors, and the frequency of

3 Claimant’ s Memorial, para 2.20.

54

consultation on issues such as pricing. Rather, the test under public international law
for whether a State “controls” or “directs” the acts and omissions of a person or group
of persons is set extremely high. As the ICJ held in Nicaragua v United States of
America, for the conduct there to have given rise to legal responsibility of the United
States, it would have to have been proven that the United States had “effective
control” of the military or para-military operations in the course of which the alleged

violations were permitted.”

5.1.26 India notes that the application of the “effective control” test in the context of State-
owned and controlled enterprise was discussed by the ILC in its commentary to

Article 8 as follows:

“the fact that the State initially establishes a corporate entity,
whether by a special law or otherwise, is not a sufficient basis
for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that

| entity. Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that
sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be

| separate, prima facia their conduct in carrying out their

| activities is not attributable to the State unless they are

| exercising elements of government authority within the

: meaning of Article 5.”

5.1.27 The test of “effective control”, as developed by the ICJ, was considered in the context
of an investment treaty claim by the ICSID tribunal in Jan de Nul NV and Dredging
International NV v Egypt. There the tribunal held that:

“international jurisprudence is very demanding in order to
attribute the act of a person or entity to a State, as it requires

both a general control of the State over the person or entity and
a specific control of the State over the act the attribution of

which is at stake; this is known as the ‘effective control’ test”. 25

Here, although Coal India oversees the coal mining sector which is owned and
controlled by the GOI, it functions and acts as a commercial undertaking and is a
profit driven enterprise. It has a distinct personality, which can sue or be sued in its
corporate name. It is entitled to enter into contracts without the need to comply with
Article 299 of the Constitution. In these circumstances, India says that it is clear that
Coal India was not carrying out any act de jure imperii, or discharging any sovereign
function, but was carrying out purely commercial acts, de jure gestionis. Thus none
of its acts - whether the calling of the performance guarantee or otherwise - are

attributable to India.

As regards the tribunal’s jurisdiction rationai temporis, India says that all of the acts /
omissions of Coal India which White seeks to attribute to India occurred prior to 28
June 1999, when White filed its Request for Arbitration with the ICC, and prior to the
entry into force of the BIT on 4 May 2000. India argues that a treaty cannot have
retroactive effect under public international law and that the provisions of Article 2(1)
of the BIT (that the BIT applies “ ... to all investments made by investors ..., whether
made before or after the coming into force of [the BIT]”) has no impact on the
operation of the temporal rule. It simply provides that the Host State must, from the
date of entry into force of the BIT, treat pre-existing investments in accordance with

the standards set out in the BIT. It does not impose those standards retroactively.

With respect to White’s characterisation of Coal India’s draw down on the CPP/CHP

Guarantee as a “continuing act” India says that the draw down was the very opposite

> Jan de Nul NV and Dredging International NV v Egypt, ICSID No. ARB/04/13, Award of 6 November 2008), para

13173.

56

 

of a “continuing act”. It was a one-off draw down which did not have the effect of
“taking” or “retaining” or “expropriating” the Bank Guarantee. And as noted above,
India points out that Coal India has not “retained” any Bank Guarantee which has

long since expired.

5.1.31 Finally, regarding the admissibility of White’s claims, India says the alleged breaches
of conduct by Coal India all arise out of the Contract and thus are subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the forum contractually agreed in the Contract, i.e., an ICC

tribunal constituted under Clause 3 of Part III of the Contract.

5.1.32 Moreover, for a breach of Contract to be elevated into a breach of a treaty, an exercise
of sovereign authority is required, but here White has not led a shred of evidence that

India instructed or directed Coal India not to return the Bank Guarantee.

5.1.33 India notes that it is not a party to the Contract and that White has not identified any
exercise by the State of sovereign authority in this case. It concludes that there were

no such acts and the relevant contractual claims are not admissible.

5.2 Breach of Article 3 (2) of the BIT

Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard

5.2.1 India argues that White’s reference to, and reliance on the Tecmed decision with
respect to the concept of legitimate expectations in relation to the fair and equitable
treatment standard is inappropriate and misleading. This is because the Tecmed
tribunal’s apparent reliance on the foreign investor’s expectations as the source of a
host State’s obligation is questionable. A host State’s obligation towards foreign
investors derives from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from a set

of expectations investors may have or claim to have.

ST

 

 

 

5.2.2

5.2.3

5.2.4

India argues that there is a high threshold for finding a violation of the fair treatment
standard. The approach taken by the tribunal in Waste Management (II) is said to
represent a balanced approach and to constitute the prevailing international position.
The Waste Management II approach is that:

“\.. the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable

treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and

harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly

unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes

the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice or involves the

lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends

judicial propriety - as might be the case with manifest failure of

natural justice in judicial proceedings or complete lack of

transparency and candour in an administrative process. In

applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in

breach of representations made by the host State which was

reasonably relied on by the claimant. 26
India says that the Tecmed tribunal went wrong when it sought to treat the concept of
legitimate expectations as involving an independent treaty standard. Rather,
legitimate expectations are concerned with due process in administrative decision-
making, ensuring the consistent application of the law and enforcing representations

by the host State only where these were made specifically enough to the particular

investor to justify reliance.

India contends that tribunals generally require specific and unambiguous
representations (encouraging remarks do not of themselves give rise to legitimate
expectations) by a host state to the investor and that the investor’s reliance be
justifiable and reasonable based on objective criteria. The latter requirement of
reasonableness of reliance carries the consequence that breach of the standard is not

determined by the investor’ subjective expectations.

58

5.2.5

5.2.6

5.2.7

5.2.8

5.2.9

India asserts that the breadth of the concept of fair and equitable treatment is limited
by two further principles: that the investor must take the host State law as it finds it
and that the standard does not operate as a guarantee against all subsequent changes in

host State law.

As regards Mr Travers Duncan’s allegations as to purported specific representations
made to him by Indian officials, to the effect that it was safe for Claimant to invest in
India and that the Indian legal system was, to all intents and purposes, the same as the
Australian legal system, India says that they do not come close to meeting the
standard required to be found a legitimate expectation the frustration of which would

constitute a breach of Article 3(2) of the BIT.

With regard to White’s complaint that India “failed to return White’s Bank
Guarantee”, Coal India did not in fact “fail to return the CHP/CPP Performance
Guarantee”. It affected a partial draw down thereon, as it was entitled to, and there is
an ongoing dispute between Coal India and White as to whether White is entitled to a
refund of the monies drawn down. Regardless, India simply did not “direct” or

“control” the conduct of Coal India.

With respect to White’s argument that India has failed to treat the Award consistently
with its “international obligations in respect of the enforcement of arbitral awards”,
the New York Convention deals with the recognition and enforcement of arbitral
awards. It does not legislate for, nor impose a regime with respect to, challenges to
awards, or the circumstances in which a court may or may not exercise jurisdiction

with respect to a setting aside application.

Finally, concerning White’s argument that India’s courts have failed to treat its case
with reasonable transparency, India argues that White has simply not provided any

59

evidence which supports this allegation.

Alleged denial of Justice

5.2.10 At the outset, India states that White has no real answer to the point that an investor

5.2.11

must take the conditions of the host State as it finds them. It says that White’s attack
on India’s explanation that its judicial system is and has always been notoriously slow
misses the point that the standards against which a State’s conduct is to be measured

is to take into account the circumstances of the host State.

India concedes that a State may, in principle, be liable for the acts of its judiciary.
However, as stated by the Mondev tribunal, the test for denial of justice is a stringent

one. For the Mondey tribunal:

“The test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but
whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial
tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the
judicial propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on the one
hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal, and
on the other hand that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other
treaties for the protection of investments) is intended to provide
a real measure of protection. In the end, the question is
whether, at an international level and having regard to
generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a
tribunal can conclude in light of all the available facts that the
impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable with
the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and

inequitable treatment 027

5.2.12 The tribunal in Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v Ecuador

agreed that:

“the test for establishing a denial of justice sets ... ahigh
threshold. While the standard is objective and does not require
an overt showing of bad faith, it nevertheless requires the

5.2.14

5.2.15

5.2.16

demonstration of “a particularly serious shortcoming and

egregious conduct that shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of

judicial propriety.””*
India contends that the events in this case plainly fall far short of this high threshold.
It says that the factors to be taken into account in determining whether there has, in
the present case, been a denial of justice are: (a) the complexity and sensitivity of the
proceedings, as well as the significance of the issues at stake; (b) the need for
swiftness in the resolution of the case, including whether the claimant may be
compensated for loss by any delays; (c) the conduct of the litigants involved,
including the diligence of the claimant in prosecuting the proceedings; (d) the

behaviour of the courts themselves; and (e) the circumstances of the host State.

With respect to the complexity of the issues at stake, India says it is clear that the
question whether the Indian Courts can entertain an application for an arbitral award
to be set aside, where that award was not made in India, has been and is a hotly
debated point of Indian arbitration law. The progress of White’s application has,

accordingly, been hampered by the complexity of the issue requiring resolution.

Dealing next with the need for swiftness in the resolution of the case, this has been an
issue in the context of proceedings and applications before human rights courts where
there is particular need for the urgent resolution of the case. In the present case, those

same considerations do not apply.

With regard to the diligence of White in prosecuting the proceedings (and the conduct

of the litigants), India says that the time taken in the proceedings before the courts of

*8 Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v Ecuador (Partial Award on the Merits of 30 March 2010),

para. 244,

61

 

5.2.17

5.2.18

5.2.19

India is directly attributable to the litigation strategy adopted by White. Had White
not challenged the maintainability of Coal India’s application before the Calcutta
High Court, the application would by now have been heard on the merits and been

disposed of.

As regards the behaviour of the Indian courts themselves, India submits that it is not
possible to criticise their conduct. The courts have in fact heard White’s various
applications and petitions within a number of months, not years, with, in all cases,
with one exception. The latter relates to the hearing on the merits of White’s complex
jurisdictional challenge by the Supreme Court which took three and a half years to
come up for hearing but had to be remitted to a three-judge bench in view of its
complexity and the existence of directly relevant authority. There simply can be no
suggestion whatever that the Indian courts have in any way been culpable of undue

delay.

Finally, this Tribunal must take into account the circumstances of the Host State. And
it is clear, as a matter of law, that India, as a developing country, with a population of
over 1.2 billion people and an over-stretched judiciary, must be held to different

standards than, for example, Switzerland, the United States or Australia.

Having regard to the facts of this case, India asserts that there has been no denial of

justice because:

(a) there has been no decision in this case, and the matter is awaiting
determination before the Supreme Court on a preliminary point of jurisdiction

raised by Claimant,

(b) there has been no undue delay. Here the time that has been taken is due to

Claimant’s litigation strategy. In any event, delay is a natural, well-known

62

5.2.20

5.3

5.3.1

5.3.2

5.3.4

and entirely predictable feature in the Indian court system. It reflects no

illegitimate conduct directed at White; and

(c) White knew, or ought to have known, that Indian law allowed and allows a
challenge to an arbitral award rendered outside India. The Indian courts in this
case have simply applied, bona fide, Indian law, as it would be applied to

anyone else, and as they are obliged to do.

In this case there also has been no specific representation to White, and no reliance,
(let alone reasonable reliance, on any such representation). Indeed, White’s alleged
“legitimate expectations” are directly contradicted by the investment environment

which prevailed at the time that White made its alleged investment in India.

Breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT

India argues that Claimant’s case based on breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT (that
India failed to “encourage and promote favourable conditions for investors of the
other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory”) contains no indication of

the applicable legal test.

However, the provisions of Article 3(1) are similar to the general, introductory and
hortatory “investment promotion” and provisions found in many BITS which,

commentators agree, do not give rise to substantive rights.

Moreover, India says that Article 3(1) fails to specify any promotional activities that
must be taken to encourage and create “favourable conditions”. It thus lacks

sufficient content to be treated as a stand-alone, positive commitment.

In any event, India asserts that the three complaints made by White with respect to the
fair and equitable treatment standard are substantive, post-investment complaints and

have nothing to do with the encouragement, promotion or admission of investments in

63

5.4

5.4.1

5.4.2

5.4.3

5.4.4

India.

Breach of Article 4 (2) of the BIT
India says that White’s allegations of breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT are
misconceived. It argues that White’s case, that India has failed to provide “effective

means” of asserting claims, must be dismissed for four principal reasons.

First, Article 4 (5) of the India-~-Kuwait BIT cannot be incorporated into the BIT. This
is because it is clear, on the face of the BIT, that both Contracting Parties placed a
strong and unusual emphasis on the application of national laws to investments.
Bearing this in mind, the provisions of Article 4 (2) must be interpreted to take into
account this balance of the BIT. Thus, Claimant’s arguments concerning the

wholesale and corporation of Article 4 (5) of the India-Kuwait BIT must be rejected.

Second, even if Article 4 (5) of the India~-Kuwait BIT can be incorporated into the
BIT, India says that the obligation stated in that provision can only be applied to
events occurring after the entry into force of the BIT, which is 28 June 2003.
Accordingly, any alleged delays that occurred prior to that date cannot be taken into
consideration in determining whether India breached the alleged “effective means

obligation”.

Third, the obligation found in Article 4 (5) of the India~Kuwait BIT is a different
obligation to that contained in Article II (7) of the US-Ecuador BIT, so the reasoning
of the Chevron tribunal is not applicable. In the present case, India argues, all that has
happened is that White’s claim has been dealt with just like any other piece of
litigation in the Indian courts. The delay that has been caused in the Indian judiciary’s
consideration of the issue has been occasioned both by the conditions of the Host
State and also, and most importantly, by White’s own litigation strategy.

64

5.4.6

5.5.1

5.5.2

5.5.3

Fourth, even if the reasoning of the Chevron tribunal is somehow relevant, the facts of
the present case are clearly distinguishable from those in Chevron. In the Chevron
case the “delay” was between 13-15 years from the commencement of the court
proceedings until the commencement of the BIT claim. It is also noteworthy that the
Chevron tribunal expressly found that there was no evidence that any action by the
Claimants had actively and significantly contributed to the delay. Indeed, a review of
the chronology of the various Indian proceedings - on the basis of White’s own
evidence - shows that there have been no “prolonged periods of complete inactivity
on the part of the [Indian] courts” and, unlike in Chevron, it cannot be said that there
is “no evidence that any action by the Claimants has actively and significantly
contributed to the delays”.”” To the contrary, the principal contributing factor to any

delay complained of by White is its own litigation strategy in India.

On these facts, India contends that this part of Claimant’s claim adds nothing to its

case for denial of justice.

Breach of Article 7 of the BIT

India says that White’s case on expropriation is hopeless for four principal reasons.

First, to the extent the “asset” alleged to have been expropriated is the Award, this is
not an “investment”. With respect to White’s rights in the Contract and the Bank
Guarantee, India also denies that these are “investments” within the meaning of the

BIT.

Dealing first with White’s rights under the Contract, India argues that the only form

of contractual rights that are capable of being “expropriated” are those that are a form

” Chevron, paras 256 and 255.

65

ed

5.5.4

5.5.5

5.5.6

5.5.8

of intangible property, such as “a right over natural resources granted by a public act
of the Host State’? Here, however, the contractual tights in question are rights under

a run-of-the-mill commercial contract for the supply of goods and services.

As regards the Bank Guarantee, India argues that it did not create any substantive
rights in White’s favour which could be expropriated. To the extent that White had
any limited rights under the Bank Guarantee, they are said patently not to be rights
which are capable of being understood as “intangible property”. Rather, they were
rights in personam. In any event, the Bank Guarantee cannot have been said to have
been expropriated. It was simply drawn upon by Coal India in the amount of

A$2,772,640 and it subsequently expired according to its terms seven days thereafter.

India asserts that the correct test to determine whether an expropriation has occurred
does not consider the impact on the value of the investment, but rather the impact on

the rights of the investor in the investment.

Second, even if the courts of India have acted wrongfully, and deprived White of any
tight to enforce the Award, the Award would not thereby have ceased to exist or have

been “expropriated”.

Third, the courts of India have not, in fact, acted wrongfully in any way. Rather,
Claimant has pursued a litigation strategy apparently designed to prevent the Indian
courts from engaging in any meaningful review of the Award, and to the extent it is

now aggrieved, it has only itself to blame.

Fourth, there has yet to be any determination of the challenge proceedings or the

5.5.9

5.5.10

5.6

5.6.4

enforcement proceedings.

India also says that White’s expropriation case is undermined by the fact that it was or

should have been aware of the Indian enforcement and challenge regime.

For the foregoing reasons, White’s argument that India as expropriated its alleged

“{nvestment” should be rejected as completely unfounded.

Breach of Article 9 of the BIT
India proposes that White’s case relating to the free transfer of funds (and breach of

Article 9) must fail for two reasons.

First, the acts of Coal India, which are not attributable to India, are not within the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal and/or admissible in this arbitration.

Second, the acts complained of do not bear any relationship with the subject matter of
Article 9, which relates the free transfer of funds as a matter of exchange control and
the like. Coal India’s entitlement to call upon the Bank Guarantee, as it did, has

nothing to do with the freedom of movement of capital in and out of India.

Finally, India says that the passage from Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, cited by White is

fatal to its own argument. The passage reads:

“The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Republic that Article 6
of the BIT is not a guarantee that investors will have funds to
transfer. It rather guarantees that if investors have funds, they
will be able to transfer them, subject to the conditions stated in
Article 6. The free transfer principle is aimed at measures that
would restrict the possibility to transfer, such as currency
control restrictions or other measures taken by the host State
which effectively imprison the investors’ funds, typically in the

67

5.7

5.7.1

5.7.2

5.7.3

5.7.4

host State of the investment. No such measures have been
taken in the present case.”*!

Compensation Due under the BIT
India says that even if White succeeds on liability, it cannot demonstrate that it has

suffered any loss or is entitled to any compensation.

This is because White has not demonstrated that Coal India’s setting aside application
and motion to resist enforcement have no reasonable prospect of success. Indeed,
Coal India has very good grounds to challenge the Award and to resist its
enforcement.” Thus, had the Supreme Court determined White’s jurisdictional
challenge to Coal India’s setting aside application, it would, in all likelihood, have
ruled that the Calcutta High Court has jurisdiction to hear Coal India’s setting aside

application.

But, even if it had ruled to the contrary, this would still have left White with the task
of persuading the Delhi High Court that the Award should be enforced in India. And
in either a setting aside or enforcement proceeding, Coal India would have been able

to raise the defences set out in its setting aside application.

India argues that White cannot therefore show that it would have obtained an order
allowing execution against Coal India and that it would have been able to execute that

order against Coal India up to the full value of the Award.

* Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v Tanzania (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award of 24 July 2008), para. 735.

* The Award was the result of an obviously flawed arbitral process. Coal India is justified in considering that the
ICC arbitration contravened basic notions of due process and fairness. Coal India is also justified in concluding that
there was, at the very least, an appearance of bias in the ways that the Chairman of the ICC arbitration, Mr
Abrahamson, conducted the arbitration. Further, Coal India has, on its face, an unimpeachable argument that the

Award was rendered outside the agreed time of six months, meaning the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with
that agreed by the parties. Finally, Coal India is also justified in considering that the Award is contrary to the public
policy of India.

6. TRIBUNAL’S APPROACH TO THE CASE ON THE MERITS
6.1 Issues for Consideration
6.1.1 At the conclusion of the hearing it was apparent that eight principal questions require

to be addressed by the Tribunal. These are:

(a) is White an “investor” in India and has it made an “investment” pursuant to

 

the BIT?

(b) does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the acts and omissions of Coal India?

(c) _ has India failed to encourage and promote favourable conditions for investors,

in breach of Article 3 (1) of the BIT?

(d) does India’s conduct amount to a breach of the fair and equitable standard and

thus a breach of Article 3 (2) of the BIT?

(e) does India’s conduct amount to a failure to provide “effective means of

4 asserting claims” and thus constitute breach of Article 4 (2) of the BIT?

| (f) has India expropriated White’s investment, contrary to Article 7 of the BIT?

70

(g) has India breached Article 9 of the BIT by failing to allow White freely to

transfer funds related to the investment?, and
(h) is White entitled to compensation for any breach of the BIT?
| 6.1.2 Each of these questions is dealt with in successive Sections of this Award below.

7. WHITE AS AN INVESTOR AND ITS INVESTMENT
| 7.1 Questions to be Addressed

7.1.1 In this Section the Tribunal requires to address five questions, as follows:
(a) does White qualify as an “Investor”;

(b) where a contractual right is relied upon to establish an “investment”, must the

contract create rights in rem;
(c) do White’s rights under the Contract qualify as an “investment”;

(d) do White’s rights under the Bank Guarantees qualify as an “investment”; and,

(e) do White’s rights under the Award qualify as an “investment”?

'

| 7.2 White as an Investor

\ 7.2.1 Article 1 of the BIT provides that an “investor” may be a “company” or a natural
person (where the latter must be either a citizen or permanent resident). It further

defines a “company” as including any corporation that is “incorporated, constituted,

set up or duly organised” under the laws of a Contracting Party.

7.2.2 Although India does not dispute that White is a company incorporated in Australia, it
argues that it is not an “investor” for the purposes of the BIT based on its assertion

that White has not made an “investment” under the BIT.

 

71

Under these circumstances, there being no denial of White’s claim to be an “investor”
in India, both limbs of India’s defence in this respect will be disposed of should the

Tribunal find that White has made an “investment”.

The Required Attributes of an Investment
The definition of “investment” in the BIT is set out in broad terms. Article 1 of the

BIT defines “investment” as follows:

“investment means every kind of asset, including intellectual
property rights, invested by an investor of one Contracting
Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in
accordance with the laws and investment policies of that
Contracting Party, and in particular, though not exclusively,
includes:

(ii) moveable and immovable property as well as other
rights such as mortgages, liens, or pledges;

(ii) shares, stocks, bonds and debentures and any other
form of participation in a company;

(iii) right to money or to any performance having a
financial value, contractual or otherwise;

(iv) business concessions and any other rights required to
conduct economic activity and having economic value
conferred by law or under a contract, including rights
to search for, extract and utilise oil and other
minerals;
(vy) activities associated with investments, such as the
organisation and operation of business facilities, the
acquisition, exercise and disposition of property rights
including intellectual property rights.” (emphasis
added)
The correct approach to be adopted by the Tribunal in assessing whether an
“investment” has been made is to consider the plain and ordinary meaning of the
words used in the BIT in their context and in the light of its object and purpose and to

determine whether the matters relied on by White satisfy the definition employed in

the BIT.

India’s principal arguments against White having made an “investment” are based on
the writings of Zachary Douglas, who sets out what he considers to be an appropriate
general test of what constitutes an “investment”. This test is said to be applicable in

all investment treaty claims - regardless of whether they are brought under the ICSID

Convention, the UNCITRAL or any other rules of arbitration.

For Douglas, it is essential than an “investment” have certain legal and economic
characteristics. These are described in his “Rules” 22 and 23, which provide:

“Rule 22: the legal materialization of an investment is the

acquisition of a bundle of rights in property that has the

characteristics of one or more of the categories of an

investment defined by the applicable investment treaty where

such property is situated in the territory of the host State or is

recognised by the rules of the host State’s private international

law to be situated in the host State or is created by the

municipal law of the host State..

Rule 23: the economic materialization of an investment

requires the commitment of resources to the economy of the

host State by the Claimant entailing the assumption of risk in

the expectation of commercial return.
Douglas’s requisite legal characteristics are derived from the non-exhaustive
examples of an “asset” that constitutes “investments” in investment treaties. This

forms the basis of Rule 22, which generalises the requirement as the acquisition of

property rights in the host State.

The requisite economic characteristics are derived from what is described as the
common economic concept of foreign direct investment. In Rule 23, they are

“codified” as the transfer of resources into the economy of the State and the

73

assumption of risk in the expectation of commercial return.

India further relies on Douglas’s proposition that, where a claimant relies upon a
contract to establish an investment pursuant to Rule 22 and 23:

“the Tribunal should differentiate between rights in personam

as between the Contracting Parties and rights in rem that are

memorialised by the contract. The rights in personam do not

generally qualify as an investment independently of the rights

in rem.”
The difficulty with India’s position on this point is that the BIT simply does not
provide that, in order to be a covered investment, the investment must be a right “in
rem”, or must have Douglas’s economic characteristics. Indeed, the BIT expressly
includes in its definition of an “investment” what can only be in personam rights,
namely: the “right to money or to any performance having a financial value,
contractual or otherwise”. And this is precisely what White had under the Contract: a
“tight to money” from Coal India for the performance of its obligations under the

Contract.

White’s Contractual Rights
It is also generally well established that rights arising from contracts may amount to

investments for the purposes of many BITs.”°

An example of such a conclusion is found in SPP v Egypt, where the tribunal there

explicitly rejected the distinction relied upon by India - namely that between rights in

* In this latter respect, India also relies on the “Salini Test”, as developed in Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade
S.p.A. v Kingdom of Morocco, and adopted in varying measure in Phoenix Action, Ltd. v the Czech Republic (ICSID
Case No. ARB/06/5 Award, 15 April 2009) and Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v Arab Republic of
Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 June 2006).

rem in and rights in personam:

“Clearly those rights and interests were of a contractual rather

than in rem nature. However, there is considerable authority

for the proposition that contract rights are entitled to the

protection of international law and that the taking of such

rights involves an obligation to make compensation

therefore.”*°
In its Statement of Defence, at paragraphs 97 and 98, in making the point that
ordinary commercial contracts of the sort represented by the Contract do not

constitute an “investment”, India referred to what is described as “‘a substantial body

of jurisprudence in the field”. This, it indicated, would be elaborated in due course.

Because this elaboration was not to be found in India’s subsequent Memorials , the
Tribunal drew counsel for India’s attention to this point during the hearing and
requested that any further case law or jurisprudence be identified in their closing
speeches. In the event, no further case law or jurisprudence was drawn to the

Tribunal’s attention.

As to whether White’s rights pursuant to the Contract qualify as an investment, it
seems evident from the Contracting Parties’ definition of “investment” that they
intended that the BIT would capture investments in the broadest sense. The Contract
also plainly conferred on White a “right to money” for the purposes of sub-paragraph
(iii), as well conferring a right to “conduct economic activity” for the purposes of sub-

paragraph (iv).

With respect to India’s contention that the Contract simply provided for payment to

White for the “provision of services”, this is not determinative of whether the

performance of White’s obligations under the Contract constitute an “investment”. It
is also clear White’s commitment under the Contract extended far beyond the

provision of equipment and technical services.

In these circumstances, having regard to the definition of “investment” in the BIT,
which clearly include White’s rights under the Contract, and the decisions of other
tribunals that rights arise from contracts may amount to investments,” the Tribunal
concludes that the fact that White’s rights under the Contract may be in personam

rather than in rem does not exclude the Contract from qualifying as an investment.

As regards the so-called “Salini Test’ for what constitutes an investment, this test was
developed in order to determine whether an “investment” had been made for the
purposes of the ICSID Convention. The cases cited by India in support of these

requirements were also ICSID decisions.

The present case, however, is not subject to the ICSID Convention. Consequently,
the so-called Salini Test, and Douglas’s interpretation of it, are simply not applicable
here. Moreover, it is widely accepted that the “double-check” (namely, of proving
that there is an “investment” for the purposes of the relevant BIT and that there is an
“investment” in accordance with the ICSID Convention), imposes a higher standard
than simply resolving whether there is an “investment” for the purposes of a particular

BIT.

However, if it could properly be said that Salini’s elements of an investment (i.e., a
substantial commitment, a certain duration, a regularity of profit and return, an
assumption of risk and a contribution to the host State’s development) were the
appropriate measure in this case, White has shown them to exist in connection with

the Contract.

First, it is beyond doubt that White made a substantial commitment in India pursuant

to the Contract.

Despite India’s assertion to the contrary, White financed its own performance of the

project, thus committing its own working capital, subject to payments by Coal India.*®

White also provided substantial funds to Coal India by way of the Bank Guarantees,

as well as equipment, personnel, training and know-how.

White hired and paid approximately one hundred local contractors to provide
technical construction services on the project. It trained Coal India’s work force both
in Australia and India (45 in Australia, 100 on site in India). It maintained a technical
staff of 34 expatriate and local employees at the Piparwar site; a full time
administrative staff of four at its office in Calcutta and a full-time administrative staff
of three at its office in Ranchi, as well as an office in Piparwar with full-time
administrative staff of five. It transferred its “Mobile In-Pit Crushing and Conveying”
technology, the use of which it pioneered in open-cut coal mines in Australia and it

transferred its own coal-washery technology.

*§ The financing requirements were substantial. The actual cost of the equipment supplied was approximately A$140.

million.

The cost of ocean freight and marine insurance came to approximately A$9.9 million. Project related

financing costs in the amount of A $9.1 million were incurred, all of which required a substantial commitment by
White of its working capital to the project.

TAAS

Second, as regards the so-called duration element, it cannot be sensibly be contended
that White failed to satisfy the “duration” limb of Salini. The Piparwar coal mine was
to be developed within sixty-six months of the date the Contract came into force. The

Contract itself was to be for six years but was eventually extended to over eight years.

The third limb of the Salini Test involves consideration of the “risk” undertaken by
the investor. Again, the Tribunal concludes that White’s investment in India satisfies
any such risk threshold. For example, White was only entitled to be paid the fee
stipulated in the Contract, regardless of the expense it incurred over the term of the
Contract. Should the project’s costs have ballooned, White would have been
substantially out of pocket. In addition, over the term of the Contract, White provided
Coal India with over A$45 million in Bank Guarantees to secure White’s proper
contractual performance. White was therefore vulnerable to the risk of draw downs
on these Bank Guarantees. Finally, White took the risk of having to pay Coal India a
substantial penalty under the Contract (of up to A$26 million) and also had a

substantial bonus at risk (of up to A$10 million).

As to the Salini profit/return element, the fact that White was to earn in excess of

A$206 million over the term of the Contract satisfies this requirement.

The final Salini element is the contribution, through the investment, to the host State’s
development. In this regard, it is to be remembered that Piparwar was initiated by the
GOI and that White collaborated with and assisted CMPDI in its feasibility
assessment to find ways to improve the productive capability of the project. This,
together with the increased production and refining of coal achieved by the
performance of the Contract were of direct benefit to the Host State’s development,

and meets this limb of the test.

It is thus clear from White’s operation under the Contract as a whole that it has made
an investment in India for the purposes of the Salini Test. The substantial financial
and work-based commitments, along with the duration of those commitments, the
high risk it assumed and the indisputable contribution to India’s development as a
result of those commitments, comprehensively satisfied any ratione materiae test that

may be said to exist under the BIT.

Bank Guarantees are not an Investment

Having concluded that the provision by White of the Bank Guarantees is properly to
be considered (under the elements of substantial commitment and assumption of risk)
in assessing whether White has made an “investment” for purposes of the Salini Test,
the Tribunal does not consider that White’s rights under those guarantees, standing

alone, constitute an “investment” under the BIT.”

The Bank Guarantee in question is the CHP/CPP Performance Bank Guarantee.
Under Article 12.2.3 of the Contract, White was required to provide a “Performance
Bank Guarantee ... as Project Performance in the amount of $12.0 Million in
mutually agreed form.” The Bank Guarantee was to “remain valid till finalization of

Bonus Penalty Payment under Article 13.3, Part-II of this Agreement.”

Article 13.1 of the Contract contains the “Project Performance Guarantees”, and these

applied to the Coal Production Plant (“CPP”) and the Coal Holding Plant (“CHP”).
Article 13.3.7 made provision for the payment of any bonus or penalty.

The performance guarantee put in place by White (including the CHP/CPP

* In this respect, White argues that the Bank Guarantees are plainly captured by the broad scope of the BIT,
specifically Article 1(c) (iii), being a right to money.

Performance Guarantee on which Coal India eventually drew down) did not provide
White with substantive (if any) rights. They were guarantees put in place by White in
favour of Coal India for the purpose of providing Coal India with the guarantee that it
would be entitled to immediate payment in case it believed that White had defaulted

on its obligations.

At most, White had the right under the Bank Guarantees to ensure that payment
would not be taken thereunder, except in the contractually stipulated circumstances

which allowed Coal India to effect a draw down.

The Bank Guarantees did not grant or create any substantive rights in favour of White
and, accordingly were not an “asset” of White. In these circumstances, the Tribunal
rejects White’s argument that its rights under the Bank Guarantees constitute an

“investment”.

White’s Rights Under the Award

White’s position as to whether the Award constitutes an “investment” has been argued
somewhat inconsistently. In paragraph 1.106 of its Memorial, it asserts that the
Award is an “investment” because it constitutes a “right to money or to any
performance having a financial value, contractual or otherwise” as provided by

Article 1(c)(iii) of the BIT.

However, in paragraph 1.107 of the Memorial it is stated that “White Industries does
not, however, allege that its rights under the Award represent an investment in itself,

but rather that the Award, is part of the original investment.

The Tribunal concludes that this latter statement more accurately describes the status

of the Award.

80

7.6.4 The Saipem tribunal reached a similar conclusion when it held that:

“The rights embodied in the ICC Award were not created by
the Award but arise out of the Contracts. The ICC Award
crystallized the parties’ rights and obligations under the
original contract.”
7.6.5 Similar reasoning was employed by the tribunals in Mondev, Chevron, and Frontier
Petroleum Services. Jn those decisions, the tribunals characterised arbitral awards as

“continuing” an investment under a contract.

7.6.6 India has cited the recent decision in GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v Ukraine (ICSID
Case No. ARB/08/16), Award, 31 March 2011 in support of its argument that White’s

rights pursuant to the Award are not a covered investment for the purposes of the BIT.

7.6.1 However, the Tribunal notes that the statement made at paragraph 161 of the GEA
Award, (“the ICC Award - in and of itself - cannot constitute an ‘investment’.
Properly analysed it’s a legal instrument which provides for the disposition of rights
and obligations arising out of the Settlement Agreement and Repayment Agreement
(neither of which was itself an ‘investment’ ...)”) was obiter dicta in light of the
tribunal’s finding that neither the Settlement Agreement nor the Repayment

Agreement were “investments” for the purposes of the Germany-Ukraine BIT.

7.6.8 The Tribunal considers that the conclusion expressed by the GEA Tribunal represents
an incorrect departure from the developing jurisprudence on the treatment of arbitral
awards to the effect that awards made by tribunals arising out of disputes concerning

“investments” made by “investors” under BITs represent a continuation or

transformation of the original investment.“'
7.6.9 The tribunal in the Chevron Jurisdiction Award concluded:
“Once an investment is established, it continues to exist and be
protected until its ultimate disposal ‘has been completed’.
7.6.10 Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that rights under the Award constitute part of
White’s original investment (i.e., being a crystalisation of its rights under the

Contract) and, as such, are subject to such protection as is afforded to investments by

the BIT.

8. THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION OVER COAL INDIA

8.1 The Acts and Omissions of Coal India Are Not Attributable to India

8.1.1 Inits Statement of Claim, White concedes that it is not relying on Articles 4 (“organ
of the State”) and 5 (“exercise of Governmental authority”) of the ILC Articles. Thus,
the sole basis upon which White seeks to contend that the acts of Coal India are
attributable to India is that provided in Article 8 of the ILC Articles (“conduct

directed or controlled by the State”).

8.1.2 This was a proper concession as Coal India is patently, not an organ of the state
within the meaning of Article 4, nor does it exercise elements of the Governmental
authority within the meaning of Article 5. This was confirmed in the Expert Report of

Justice Srikrishna.

8.1.3. Article 8 provides that:

“ Rather than define awards as “investments” in and of themselves, tribunals such as Mondev, Chevron and Frontier
Petroleum Services have characterised their findings as providing protection to the subsisting interests that [the
investor] continued to hold in the original investment.

“The conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be
considered an act of State under international law if the person
or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or
under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the
conduct.”
8.1.4 This issue therefore turns on whether the facts in the record support a conclusion of
whether Coal India was in fact acting on the instructions of or under the direction or

control of India. And as to this, the test is a tough one.

8.1.5 White points to various factors which, in its view, satisfy the test of “direction” or
“control”. It refers to the alleged “extraordinary level of top-down control of India by
the Republic”, the fact that Coal India is a “Government Company” within the
meaning of Section 617 of the India Companies Act 1956; the fact that Coal India was
wholly-owned by the Host State at the time of the alleged breaches by Coal India, the
fact that India had control over the appointment of Coal India’s board of directors and
that India, in fact, regularly exercised direction and control over Coal India. White
concludes that:

“Given the practical control which India has over Coal India,
and the history of India’s exercise of that control, it follows that
(at the relevant time), Coal India had such a close relationship

with India that Coal India could be said to have been acting

‘on the instructions of, or under the direction of’ the Republic

of India, in accordance with Article 8 of the ILC Articles”.
8.1.6 To the extent that White relies on the organisational structure of Coal India, the

manner of appointment of its directors, and the frequency of consultation on issues

such as pricing, these matters are largely irrelevant with regard to Article 8.
8.1.7. The applicable test as set forth by the ILC in the commentary to Article 8, is as

follows:

* Claimant’ s Memorial, para 2.20.

83

8.1.8

8.1.9

8.1.10

8.1.11

8.1.12

“Such conduct shall be attributable to the State only if it
directed or controlled the specific operation and the conduct
complained of was an integral part of that operation”.
(emphasis added)
Such a test excludes from consideration matters of organisational structure and

“consultation” on operational or policy matters.

White in the present case complains about Coal India’s call on the Bank Guarantees,
its alleged “wrongful retention” of the Bank Guarantee, and its decision to challenge

the ICC Award in the Indian Courts.

As foreshadowed by the wording of Article 8, the test under public international law
for whether a state “controls” or “directs” the acts and omissions of a person or group

of persons involves a high threshold.

In Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, The International
Court of Justice (ICJ) and had to consider whether the conduct of the Contras could
be attributed to the United States, such that the United States could be held

responsible for breaches of international humanitarian law committed by the Contras.

Although the ICJ observed that the United States was responsible for the “planning,
direction and support” given by the United States to the Contras, this did not mean
that all of the conduct of the Contras was attributable to the United States. The ICJ

held that:

“[D]espite the heavy subsidies and other support provided to
them by the United States, there is no clear evidence of the
United States having actually exercised such a degree of
control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting
on its behalf. ... All the forms of United States participation

84

mentioned above, and even the general control by the
respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency
on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence,
that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of
the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law
alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be
committed by members of the contras without the control of the
United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal
responsibility of the United States, it would have to be proved
that the State had effective control of the military or
paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged
violations were committed.”

8.1.13 In the ILC’s discussion of the Nicaragua case, it noted that:

“[W]hile the United States was held responsible for its own
support for the contras, only in certain individual instances
were the acts of the contras themselves held attributable to it,
based upon actual participation of and directions given by that
State. The Court confirmed that a general situation of
dependence and support would be insufficient to justify
attribution of the conduct to the State.”

8.1.14 The ICJ’s test of “effective control”, as developed in the Nicaragua case, was

reaffirmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case in 2007. There, the ICJ stated that:

“[I]t has to be proved that [the persons or groups] acted in
accordance with that State’s instructions or under its ‘effective
control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’
was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in
respect of each operation in which the alleged violations
occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken
by the persons or groups of persons having committed the
violations.”

8.1.15 The application of this test in the context of state-owned and controlled enterprises

was discussed by the ILC in its commentary to Article 8 as follows:

* Nicaragua v United States of America, at pp. 62, 64-65, paras, 109 and 115.
“6 James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (2002), p. 111, para. 4.
*” [2007] ICI Rep 43, 208, para 400.

“Questions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or
enterprises which are State-owned and controlled. ... In
discussing this issue it is necessary to recall that international
law acknowledges the general separateness of corporate entities
at the national level, except in those cases where the ‘corporate
veil’ is a mere device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion. The fact
that the State initially establishes a corporate entity, whether by
a special law or otherwise, is not a sufficient basis for the
attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity.
Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense
subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate,
prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not
attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of
governmental authority within the meaning of article 5. This
was the position taken, for example, in relation to the de facto
seizure of property by a State-owned oil company, in a case
where there was no proof that the State used its ownership
interest as a vehicle for directing the company to seize the
property.”®

8.1.16 The test of “effective control”, as developed by the ICJ, was considered in the context
of an investment treaty claim by the ICSID tribunal in Jan de Nul NV and Dredging

International NV v Egypt. That tribunal put the position as follows:

“International jurisprudence is very demanding in order to
attribute the act of a person or entity to a State, as it requires
both a general control of the State over the person or entity and
a specific control of the State over the act the attribution of
which is at stake; this is known as the ‘effective control’
test.”(emphasis added) 49

8.1.17 The test of “effective control” was described in near identical terms by the ICSID

tribunal in Gustav F Hamester GmbH and Co KG v Ghana.*°

8.1.18 Thus, for the allegedly wrongful conduct of Coal India to give rise to the

“ James Crawford, The International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (2002), p. 112, para. 6

responsibility of India, White has to show that India had both general control over
Coal India as well as specific control over the particular acts in question. And to the

Tribunal’s mind, White has failed to make such a showing.

8.1.19 On the record before us, there is simply no suggestion that the officers and employees
of Coal India required or obtained the approval of India to activate the Bank
Guarantee. It is also clear that the GOI was not involved, either directly or indirectly,
in the negotiation of the detailed contractual terms of the Contract with White - this is
clear from the testimony Mr Ghodke and Mr Malhotra. Further, the GOI played no
role in the “execution, implementation or completion” of the project - this was for
Coal India. As Mr Malhotra explained:

“the role of the Government of India was limited to facilitating
and improving CIL’s Piparwar Project. As I have explained
above, the Government was required to approve the Piparwar
Project, because CIL’s utilisation of public funds in Piparwar
had to be sanctioned by the Government”

8.1.20 Moreover, as Mr Ghodke states:

“the Government did not carry out any ‘monitoring’ of the
project on a day-to-day basis, and it did not guide, direct or
instruct Coal India Limited to act or not to act in a particular
manner and/or as to how to execute or implement the Contract
it had with the Claimant. Coal India, not the Government, was
the counter-party to the Contract and was in charge of
implementing it, using its expertise in this field. ns

8.1.21 Based on the documentary and testimonial record, the Tribunal therefore concludes

that the evidence does not support White’s contention that the conduct of Coal India is

properly to be attributed to India.

9.2.1. As construed by White, Article 3(1) requires each of the Contracting Parties to take
concrete, positive steps in the interests of investors generally. It says, on the facts of

this case, that this gives rise, at the very least, to three obligations on the part of India:

(a) to create a suitable governance framework for supervising the action of state-
owned corporations, including Coal India, in their dealings with foreign

investors;

(b) to ensure that its arbitration laws are administered in line with India’s New

York Convention obligations; and

 

(c) to take steps to reduce the backlog of cases in its courts, given the prospect

| that such backlog must necessarily have significant effect on domestic and
international businesses, including investors, as defined under the BIT.

9.2.2 Thus, if India had complied with its obligations under Article 3(1) of the BIT, then

India would not:

| (a) have permitted Coal India, improperly to call upon the Bank Guarantee and

improperly to retain funds to which White was entitled;

(b) through its Courts, have breached its obligations under the New York
Convention by purporting to exercise jurisdiction to set aside awards made

outside India; and

88

 

9.2.3

9.2.4

9.25

9.2.6

9.2.7

9.2.8

(c) through its Courts, have denied justice to White, through what it describes as

an extraordinary delay in resolving legal proceedings.

As construed by India, Article 3(1) provides for two general obligations. These are:

(a) First, a pre-establishment obligation (i.e., prior to the admission of the
investment), which requires the Contracting Parties to “encourage and

promote favourable conditions” for investors; and

(b) Second, an obligation on each Contracting State to “admit” investments by
“investors” of the other Contracting Party (in accordance with its laws and

investment policies applicable from time-to-time).

Because White does not argue that India breached the second of these obligations,
India says that White’s case must therefore be concerned with the pre-establishment

obligation. The Tribunal agrees.

As to the nature of such an obligation, there is very little case law or jurisprudence.
The only case cited by Claimant, National Grid ple v Argentina, involved a
consideration of the terms of the equivalent provision in the United Kingdom-
Argentina BIT in the context of its finding on the content of the fair and equitable

standard.

As such, the case is of no real assistance, although it is clear that the tribunal there
made no finding whatever as to the scope of the obligation “to encourage and promote

favourable conditions”.

However, commentators seem to agree that such provisions in BITs do not give rise to

substantive rights.

For instance, McLachlan, Shore and Weiniger state that: “BITs usually contain a

provision pursuant to which investments are encouraged, but within the legal

89

 

 

9.2.9

framework prevailing in the Host State.” Such provisions are contrasted by the
authors with the provisions conferring “substantive rights” on investors which are

dealt with separately.

Likewise, Dolzer and Schreuer, do not include the obligation to “encourage and
promote favourable conditions” for investments in their list of substantive standards

of protection.> 3

9.2.10 In their work on investment treaty arbitrations, Newcombe and Paradell write that:

“Promotion Obligations in BITs generally are weak and
subject to Host State laws. In most BITs promotion and
encouragement are the presumed by-products of specific,
substantive and procedural investment protections. General
promotion and encouragement obligations do not liberalise
admission and establishment nor require States to adopt
specific measures to promote FDI.”**

9.2.11 The only circumstances in which the authors speculate that such a provision might

impose restrictions on the host State are where that State takes:

“certain types of economic measure against its [BIT] treaty
partners unless permitted to do so in accordance with its
obligations under a specific treaty regime, such as by the
United Nations Security Council or the World Trade
Organisation. vs

9.2.12 The Tribunal is inclined to agree with India’s position that the pre-establishment

obligations set out in the first sentence in Article 3(1) of the BIT lack sufficient

content to be treated as a stand-alone, positive commitment giving rise to substantive

rights. However, it is not necessary to construe the first sentence of Article 3(1) so
broadly, since the Tribunal is satisfied that the language used in Article 3(1) is far too
general to support the three specific obligations contended for by White referred to

above.

9.2.13 Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that India has not breached the obligation to
encourage and promote favourable conditions for investors under Article 3(1) of the

BIT.

10. ARTICLE 3(2) - FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
10.1 Questions to be addressed

10.1.1 In this Section the following questions are addressed:

(a) _ has India breached the fair and equitable standard by reason of the conduct of

Coal India in relation to the Bank Guarantees;

(b) _ has India frustrated White’s legitimate expectations and thereby breached the

fair and equitable standard; and

(c) _ has the conduct of India’s courts regarding the set aside and/or enforcement
applications amounted to a denial of justice to White in breach of the fair and

equitable standard?

10.2 Coal India’s dealing with the Bank Guarantee

10.2.1 White’s first asserted claim in respect of Article 3 (2) of the BIT is that Coal India’s

alleged “improper taking and retention” of the Bank Guarantee amounts to a breach of

the obligation to accord White fair and equitable treatment.

91

 

 

10.2.2 White’s specific claims are first that “Coal India was never entitled to take or retain

10.2.3

10.3

10.3.1

10.3.2

2356

the bank guarantee””” and, second, that India failed “to exercise proper supervision of

Coal India and thereby correct this unlawful retention”®”.

It is apparent that this claim can only get off the ground if the act of Coal India in
drawing on the Bank Guarantee and/or improperly retaining the funds drawn under it
are attributable to India. Thus, given the Tribunal’s conclusion that Coal India’s
conduct in this regard cannot properly be attributable to India, it follows that White’s

claim for breach of Article 3(2) of the BIT by reason of this conduct must fail.

White’s Legitimate Expectations

White initially sought to rely on its alleged legitimate expectations that:

(a) India, as a party to the New York Convention, would apply the Convention

properly and in accordance with international standards; and

(b) India would afford justice to White by allowing it to enforce the Award, in the

courts of India, in a fair and reasonably timely manner.°®

Faced with India’s Defence that such vague and general allegations cannot found a
claim based on frustration of legitimate expectations, White led evidence from Mr
Duncan, one of its directors, concerning a range of representations which were said to
have been made to him by (named and unnamed) Indian officials, to the effect that: it

was safe for White to invest in India; that the Indian legal system was, to all intents

5° Claimant’s Memorial, para 4.3
*” Claimant’ s Memorial, para 4.3

** From White’ s submissions it is clear that it considers that a proper application of the New York Convention requires
the courts of a State to decline jurisdiction to vacate a foreign award unless the parties have agreed that the arbitration
proceedings giving rise to the award was to be governed by the laws of that State.

92

and purposes, the same as the Australian Legal system; and, accordingly, it could

expect fair treatment.

10.3.3 In his closing speech, Mr Bonnell also referred to India’s failure to ensure that its

courts treated White’s case with reasonable transparency.

| 10.3.4 For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal concludes that none of White’s allegations
meet the standard required to establish a legitimate expectation the breach of which

would constitute any infringement of Articles 3(2) of the BIT.

10.3.5 To the extent that White relies on the dicta of the Tecmed tribunal, to the effect that
fair and equitable treatment requires a State:
“to provide to international investment treatment that does not
affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by
the foreign investor to make the investment, 58
the Tribunal notes that the statement has been subject to what it considers to be valid

criticism.

10.3.6 The so-called Tecmed standard is potentially very broad in application. Indeed, as

t

Douglas has observed, “it is actually not a standard at all; it is rather a description of a

perfect public regulation in a perfect world, to which all states should aspire but very

 

few (if any) will ever attain,”®!

para 304.

® Douglas, supra.

10.3.7 As to the applicable standard, the Tribunal prefers the statement by Newcombe and

Paradell that:

“legitimate expectations about the treatment of investments will
arise ‘based on the conditions offered by the host State at the
time of the investment.’ [Investment treaty] jurisprudence
highlights that, to create legitimate expectations, State conduct
needs to be specific and unambiguous. Encouraging remarks
from government officials do not of themselves give rise to
legitimate expectations. There must be an ‘unambiguous
affirmation’ or a ‘definitive, unambiguous and repeated
assurances’. The conduct must be targeted at a specific person
or identifiable group.””

Expectations Regarding Bank Guarantees

10.3.8 Dealing first with White’s complaint that India failed to return the Bank Guarantee,
this aspect of its claim must fail (even assuming a legitimate expectation as alleged
could have been created) because the conduct of Coal India is not properly to be

attributed to India.

Expectations Regarding Setting Aside

 

| 10.3.9 White’s complaints about its treatment by the India courts are dealt with
substantively in connection with White’s denial of justice claims at 10.4 below, and
its effective means of asserting claims case, at Section 11 below. However, as
regards its alleged legitimate expectations in this regard, it has no proper ground for

complaint.

® Newcombe and Paradell, Law and Practice of Investment Treaties : Standards of Treatment (2009) pp. 281-282.
Newcombe and Paradell draw on Metalclad (need for specific and unambiguous contract), GAMS (need for
unambiguous, definitive, repeated assurances) and Nagel (encouraging remarks are not enough to give rise to
legitimate expectations).

94

 

|
|

 

 

10.3.10 This is because White acknowledges that, at the time of its investment, awards made

10.3.11

10.3.12

(in international arbitrations seated) outside of India were subject to being set aside

in the Indian courts:
(a) if the underlying arbitration agreement was governed by Indian law®;

(b) unless the parties to the arbitration agreement had agreed to exclude the

application of the 1940 Act.

Thus, based on what White knew, or ought to have known, at the relevant time about
the arbitral law of India, it could only have expected the Indian courts to decline to
entertain a setting aside application concerning any future award on the basis that it
and Coal India had agreed under the Contract to exclude the application of the 1940
Act (i.e., not because the Indian courts would decline such jurisdiction by reason of

the Convention).

Put differently, even assuming a legitimate expectation in this respect could arise in
the absence of unambiguous affirmation to the effect by India, the facts simply do
not support White’s case. Because, at the time the Contract was negotiated, the
Indian courts were regularly entertaining set-aside applications in respect of so-
called foreign awards, White’s only reasonable basis of belief that the Award might
not be subject to setting aside rested in the efficacy of its and Coal India’s
contractual exclusion (India was not a party) of the 1940 Act, and not on any belief

as to how India would apply the New York Convention.

§ The Contact itself was governed by Indian law and White made no case that the arbitration agreement contained
therein was governed by a different law.

95

need

10.3.13 In these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that White could not legitimately
have expected that India would “apply the [New York] Convention properly and in
accordance with international standards” as such standards were understood by

White.
Expectations Regarding Timely Enforcement

10.3.14 With respect to White’s claimed expectation that it would be allowed to enforce any
award in India “in a fair and reasonably timely manner”, White (again) either knew
or ought to have known at the time it entered into the Contract that the domestic
court structure in India was overburdened. By way of example, when the Law
Commission of India examined the functioning of the Supreme Court in 1988, it
noted, inter alia, that:

“Apart from the continuous rise in the quantum of arrears [of
cases requiring disposition] year to year, the more disturbing
fact is that the cases, after having been brought to the Supreme
Court, are not disposed of for over a decade. 64

10.3.15 Quite apart from the point that an investor must generally take a host State
(including its court system) as it finds it, on these facts, and absent an express
assurance from India that any award would be enforced in a particular manner or
timeframe, it is simply not possible for White, legitimately, to have had the

expectation as to the timely enforcement of the Award that it now asserts.

10.3.16 Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that this allegation of breach of the fair and

equitable standard must also be dismissed.

Expectations Regarding India as a Place to Invest

S125" Report in the Supreme Court — A Fresh Look, Law Commission of India, 1988

96

10.3.17 As regards White’s alleged legitimate expectations based on the range of
representations said to have been made to Mr Duncan (e.g., that it would be treated
fairly, that India was a safe place to do business etc), the Tribunal agrees with India
that the alleged representations suffer from vagueness and generality, such that they
are not capable of giving rise to reasonable legitimate expectations that are amenable

to protection under the fair and equitable treatment standard.

10.3.18 The Tribunal also considers that there was no evidence to show that India turned out
to be an unsafe or insecure place in which to invest, that its legal system and laws
were not derived from England or that fair treatment before the law was lacking.
This is because White’s primary complaints go to delays in the Indian court

i proceedings and the fact that it appears that the courts in India will accept set aside

i jurisdiction over foreign arbitral awards.

10.3.19 For these reasons, this allegation of breach of the fair and equitable standard must

fail.
| Expectation Regarding Transparency of Court Proceedings

10.3.20 Finally, as regards an expectation for transparency in court proceedings, there is
i again simply no evidence to support either such an expectation as being reasonably

legitimate, or to show a sufficient lack of transparency to found a breach. As

 

discussed below, certain aspects of the proceedings were admittedly slow and each

of the applications remains unresolved more than nine years later, but a lack of speed

does not equate to a lack of transparency. No more so does the fact that the Supreme
4 Court does not fix specified dates for when its appeals are to be heard until close to

the actual hearing date.

a

97

10.3.21 The Tribunal thus concludes that White’s case for breach of Article 3(2), based on a

lack of transparency in the court proceedings must fail.

10.4 Denial of Justice

10.4.1 White’s case for a denial of justice is based on:

(a) _ the Indian courts allegedly improper exercise of jurisdiction in asserting that

they have the power to set aside the Award;

(b) _ the Indian courts’ delay in dealing with the enforcement of the Award (i.e., a
failure to provide justice to White by allowing the enforcement process — and
the dispute and setting aside proceedings — to continue for more than nine

years without any realistic end in sight); and

(c) Coal India’s improper call upon the Bank Guarantee and its improper retention

of funds.

10.4.2 Having regard to the Tribunal’s conclusion that Coal India’s conduct, improper or
otherwise, cannot properly be attributed to India, the only questions that now need to

be dealt with are those in (a) and (b) above.

10.4.3 In this regard, White does not make a distinction between the improper exercise
jurisdiction over Coal India’s set aside application and the courts’ delay in dealing

with its own enforcement application.

10.4.4 While White asserts that it is a breach of India’s obligations under the New York
Convention, and international law, for its domestic courts to purport to have
jurisdiction to set aside the Award, in practical terms, White’s denial of justice case is

founded on the fact that the set aside application/its enforcement application has been

98

pending for over nine years. Thus, White argues, India has denied it fair and equitable
treatment by preventing it from enforcing the Award (which proceeding; in the

meantime, is stayed) in India in a fair and reasonably timely manner.

10.4.5 India properly concedes that a State may be liable for the acts of its judiciary. Even if
this is so, however, it asserts, as was stated by the Mondey tribunal, that the test for

denial of justice is a stringent one. The Tribunal agrees.
10.4.6 In Mondey, it was held that:

“The test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but
whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial
tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the
judicial propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on the one
hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal, and
on the other hand that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other
treaties for the protection of investments) is intended to provide
areal measure of protection. In the end, the question is
whether, at an international level and having regard to
generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a
tribunal can conclude in light of all the available facts that the
impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable with
the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and

inequitable treatment”.

10.4.7 The tribunal in Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v Ecuador

agreed, stating that:

 

“the test for establishing a denial of justice sets ...a high

' threshold. While the standard is objective and does not require
an overt showing of bad faith, it nevertheless requires the
demonstration of ‘a particularly serious shortcoming and
egregious conduct that shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of

judicial propriety’. 766

para. 244,

99

10.4.8 It is clear that this is a stringent standard, and that international tribunals are slow to
make a finding that a State is liable for the international delict of denial of justice. As
the Great Britain-Mexico Claims Commission put it:

“Tt is obvious that such a grave reproach can only be directed
against a judicial authority upon evidence of the most
convincing nature.”

10.4.9 Further, public international law does not provide fixed time limits within which
certain classes of cases must be resolved. As the ICSID tribunal obeserved in Toto v
Lebanon:

“international law has no strict standards to assess whether
court delays are a denial of justice.”®

10.4.10 The assessment of whether a judicial delay amounts to a denial of justice is

obviously highly fact-sensitive. International tribunals have identified various factors
which are relevant to the determination of whether delays in judicial proceedings
amount to a denial of justice. These include the complexity of the proceedings, the

need for swiftness, the behaviour of the litigants involved, the significance of the

 

interest at stake and the behaviour of the courts themselves.

Complexity of the Set Aside / Enforcement Proceedings

 

10.4.11 Dealing first with complexity, the Tribunal does not consider there to be anything
particularly complex about the White’s application to enforce the Award. However,
the progress of that application has obviously been affected by Coal India’s own

previous application to set the Award aside. And, as to that proceeding, it is clear

that the question of whether, having regard to India’s obligations under the New
York Convention, Indian courts can properly entertain an application to set aside an
arbitral award not made in India has been, and is, a hotly debated point of Indian

arbitration law.”

10.412 Although the proceedings before the Calcutta High Court in first instance, and on
appeal, were completed with reasonable expedition (the Appellant Division of the

Calcutta High Court dismissed White’s appeal on 7 May 2004), things slowed down

® Although there is Supreme Court authority for the proposition that Indian courts can maintain an application for the
setting aside of an award which was not made in India, the relevant cases have been heavily criticised, and some
judges of the Supreme Court are themselves clearly open to persuasion the other way. While the point is accordingly
not settled, it is evident that, at the time White made its application challenging the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High
Court to entertain Coal India’s setting aside application, it could not be decided in White’s favour at any level lower
than that of a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court.

Arbitrator Brower is of the view that it is not surprising that the India courts have been subject to criticism since, to his
mind, the clear consensus among States is that only the courts of the seat of arbitration — i.e., “the country in which...
th{e] award was made” (see Article V(1)(e) of the New York Convention) - are competent to set aside a foreign
arbitral award. See, e.g., Steel Corp. of the Philippines v. International Steel Services, Inc., U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania, 6 Feb. 2008 (United States); Empresa Colombiana de Vias Férreas v. Drummond
Ltd., Colombian State Council, 24 Oct. 2003 and 22 Apr. 2004 (Colombia); Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan
Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 27 Mar.
2003 (Hong Kong). He refers to Professor van den Berg’s authoritative treatise on the New York Convention (“The
New York Arbitration Convention of 1958” at 350) which explains that: “The ‘competent authority’ as mentioned in
Article V(1)(e) [of the New York Convention] for entertaining the action of setting aside the award is virtually always
the court of the country in which the award was made. The phrase ‘or under the law of which’ the award was made
[in Article V(1)(e) of the New York Convention] refers to the theoretical case that on the basis of an agreement of the
parties the award is governed by an arbitration law which is different from the arbitration law of the country in which
the award was made.”

Arbitrator Brower concludes that, contrary to the Indian courts’ findings, a choice of Indian law as the law governing
the Contract is not considered under the New York Convention to imply a choice of Indian arbitration law displacing
the arbitration law of the seat of arbitration. Id. at 293 (“If the parties provide a general choice of law clause, they
intend to give a directive to the arbitrator as to which law he has to apply to the substance. The distinction between
substance and procedure would then preclude that the directive given to the arbitrator would also be an ‘indication’
of a choice of the law governing the arbitration. It would therefore seem that the latter can be achieved only by a
distinct express agreement. . .. Thus if a contract contains a general choice of law clause and provides in the arbitral
clause that arbitration is to be held in a country with a different law, the latter indication [(i.e., ‘that the choice of law
clause for the contract in general is not sufficient as choice of law for the arbitral clause’)] must be deemed to prevail
over the former [(i.e., that the choice of law clause for the contract in general ‘also applies to the arbitral clause’)].”).

For Arbitrator Brower, the 1996 Act cannot justify the actions of the Indian judiciary since, as explained by Professor
van den Berg, the New York Convention supersedes domestic law concerning the enforcement of foreign arbitral
awards: “[SJome courts still seem to have difficulties in applying the Convention’s principle that it supersedes
domestic law concerning the enforcement of foreign awards . . . The grounds for refusal of enforcement mentioned in
Article V, or, as the case may be, in the corresponding Article in the implementing Act, are exclusive if the
enforcement is governed by the Convention, and do not leave any room for reference to the law of the forum on this
point.” Id. at 268.

 

101

in the Supreme Court. However, having regard to the significance of the issue in
India, as well as existing Supreme Court precedent, it is not particularly surprising,
or shocking, in the Indian context, that the Supreme Court has not disposed of the
matter.’° Nor does the delay raise concerns with the Tribunal as to the judicial

propriety of the outcome.
Significance of Issues

10.4.13 It is evident on the record (the effect of Indian case law to date is not disputed) that
the issues involved in the set-aside application are of obvious significance in the

field of commercial arbitration in India.
Need for a swift resolution

10.4.14 Turning next to the need for swiftness in the resolution of the matter, the Tribunal
considers it relevant to distinguish between criminal proceedings (and applications
before human rights courts), where there is a particular need for the urgent resolution
of cases, and purely commercial matters such as are involved here. This is not to say
that commercial matters can properly be allowed to languish. However, where, as
here, the Award also contained an order for the payment of interest, the need for

celerity is less compelling.

Behaviour of the Litigants

7 After leave to appeal was granted in 2004, White’s appeal was listed for an early hearing before the Supreme Court
on 8 January 2007. That hearing did not proceed because White’s appeal was listed together with another petition that
raised similar issues which was not ready to proceed. White’s appeal was then directed to be heard together with
another petition that raised a similar issue. That matter was then actually heard before a bench of two judges of the
Supreme Court on 16 January 2008. When one of the judges concerned expressed reservations as to the correctness of
two previous judgments of the Supreme Court, the matter had then to be placed before the Chief Justice in order to be
listed before another, three judge bench. At the time of the oral hearing, the appeal had not been scheduled for
hearing.

102

10.4.15 As regards the question of the litigants own behaviour, the Tribunal is not attracted
by India’s argument that the time which the proceedings have taken before the
Indian courts is due entirely to White’s litigation strategy (i.e., had White not sought
to raise the jurisdictional point, the compatibility of the Award with the Indian legal
system would have long since been adjudicated). From the perspective of a tribunal
applying international law, White cannot properly be criticised for seeking to be
treated by India’s courts in accordance with what it reasonably believed were India’s

New York Convention obligations.

10.4.16 The Tribunal thus rejects India’s contention that the delay experienced before the
Indian courts results solely from White’s attempts to avoid a decision on the merits

of Coal India’s setting aside application.
Behaviour of the Indian Courts

10.4.17 Finally, with respect to the behaviour of the Indian courts themselves, the Tribunal

| notes that both the Calcutta High Court and the Delhi High Court heard White’s
various applications and petitions within months, not years. It is also evident, given

| the many interim issues that arose, that matters progressed in both of those courts

with reasonable celerity until: (a) in the case of the setting aside application, the

Supreme Court granted leave to appeal on 29 September 2004; and (b) in the case of

the enforcement application, the Delhi High Court ordered a stay on 9 March 2006.

10.4.18 The Tribunal considers it also to be relevant, when examining the behaviour of the

 

courts, to bear in mind that India is a developing country with a population of over

4 1.2 billion people with a seriously overstretched judiciary.

103

10.4.19 The most recent delay in this case stems from the apparent inability of the Supreme
Court to impanel a three judge bench in a timely manner and from the stay ordered
of the enforcement proceedings by the Delhi High Court (of which more in Section

11 below).

10.4.20 In El Oro Mining and Railway Co, the Great Britain-Mexico Claims Commission
stated that:
“the amount of work incumbent on the Court and the multitude
of law suits with which they are confronted, may explain, but
not excuse, the delay. If this number is so enormous as to
occasion an arrear of nine years, the conclusion cannot be
other than the judicial machinery is defective.””!
10.4.21 In the present case, although more than nine years have elapsed since the
commencement of the set aside and the enforcement proceedings in September
2002, for the purposes of determining whether White has been denied justice, the
Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to focus on the delay that has resulted from
the Supreme Court’s failure to constitute an appropriate panel to hear White’s
jurisdictional appeal — i.e., just under four years. This is because it considers that the
proceedings in the Calcutta and Delhi High Courts moved at a not unreasonable pace

in the context of a denial of justice assessment.
Tribunal’s Overall Conclusion

10.4.22 Bearing in mind these various factors, the Tribunal concludes that, while the
duration of the proceedings overall, as well as the delay by the Supreme Court in

hearing and determining the jurisdiction appeal, is certainly unsatisfactory in terms

7 El Oro Mining and Railway Co (Ltd) (Great Britain) v United Mexican State, V RIAA191 (Great Britain-Mexico
Claims Commission, Decision No. 55 of 18 June 1931)

104

of efficient administration of justice, neither has yet reached the stage of constituting

a denial of justice.

10.4.23 While the most recent delay is regrettable, there being no suggestion of bad faith, it
does not amount in the Tribunal’s mind to “a particularly serious shortcoming” or
“egregious conduct that ‘shocks or at least surprises, a sense of judicial

99972

proprietary

10.4.24 Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that White’s Article 3(2) case based on a denial

of justice must fail.

11. ARTICLE 4(2) - EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ASSERTING CLAIMS

11.1 Article 4(2) of the BIT

11.1.1 Article 4(2) of the BIT provides that:
“A Contracting Party shall at all times treat investments in its
own territory on a basis no less favourable than that accorded
to investments or investors of any third country.

11.1.2 Article 4(2) is what has become known as a “most favoured nation” (“MFN”) clause.

11.1.3 In this connection, White asserts breach by India of the obligation it took on pursuant
to Article 4(5) of the Agreement Between the Republic of India and the State of
Kuwait for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 27

November 2001 (“India-Kuwait BIT”).
11.1.4 Article 4(5) of the India~Kuwait BIT provides, in pertinent part:

“Each Contracting State shall maintain a favourable
environment for investments in its territory by investors of the

” Supra, at para 244

105

 

11.1.5

11.2

11.2.1

11.2.2

11.2.3

other Contracting State. Each Contracting State shall, in
accordance with its applicable laws and regulations, provide
effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with
respect to investments... .” (Emphasis added by the Tribunal)

It is White’s contention that a delay of over nine years in a party’s application to
enforce an international arbitral award in a country which is a party to the New York
Convention represents an unacceptable delay by objective and international standards
and, accordingly, India’s failure to enforce the Award constitutes breach of the

Republic’s obligation to provide “effective means of asserting claims and enforcing

tights” with respect to White’s investments.

Does Article 4(2) of the BIT incorporate Article 4(5) of the India-Kuwait BIT?
With respect to India’s assertion that Article 4(2) of the BIT does not incorporate
Article 4(5) of the India-Kuwait BIT, because to do so would: (a) fundamentally
subvert the carefully negotiated balance of the BIT; and (b) be contrary to the
emphasis in the BIT on domestic law; the Tribunal agrees with White that neither of

these arguments is sustainable.

On the first point, the concern of McLachlan, Shore and Weiniger to this effect
(relied upon above by India) is confined to the use of an MFN clause to obtain the

benefit of a dispute resolution clause in another treaty.”

However, that is not the situation in the present case, which is qualitatively different.
Here, White is not seeking to put in issue the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT,
but is instead availing itself of the right to rely on more favourable substantive

provisions in the third-party treaty.

73 India asserts that Article 4(5) of the India-Kuwait-BIT ought not to be incorporated into the BIT as to do so would
(in the words of McLachlan, Shore and Weiniger) “have the effect of fundamentally subverting the carefully
negotiated balance of the BIT in question.”

106

lL

11.2.4 This does not “subvert” the negotiated balance of the BIT. Instead, it achieves exactly

11.2.5

11.2.6

11.2.7

11.2.8

the result which the parties intended by the incorporation in the BIT of an MFN

clause.

With regard to India’s second point, that use of the MEN clause in question would be
contrary to the “strong emphasis” on domestic law said to be found in the BIT, the
Tribunal concludes that the protection of Article 4(5) of the India-Kuwait BIT is in no

way contrary to any of the provisions of the BIT.

The provisions of the BIT referred to in paragraph 16 of India’s Defence (where India
points to the provisions of the BIT which are said to place unusual emphasis on and
deference to national law) are not in any way unusual in BITs.”* When construed in
accordance with ordinary rules of treaty interpretation, such provisions do not mean
that national laws “trump” international laws, or that the content of national laws

affects the interpretation to be given to obligations freely given by the State in BIT.

In any event, as noted above, the Tribunal sees no conflict between these provisions
and Article 4(5) of the India~-Kuwait BIT; certainly India failed to explain how these
provisions could be inconsistent with that Article. Moreover, there is no express
carve-out or limitation to Article 4(5), and nothing in the Article (or any provision of

the BIT) would require the result contended for by India.

In considering whether the protection provided by the MFN clause in the India-

Kuwait BIT should be limited by reason of the BIT’s “strong emphasis” on India’s

74 See (for example): agreement between Australia and the Czech Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and
Protection of Investments 1994, Articles 3(1), 3(3), 5(1), 5(2), and 12; Agreement between the Government of Hong
Kong and the Government of Australia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments 1993, Articles 2(1), 3(3) and
8(1); Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments 1991, Articles II(2) and IV; and Agreement between Canada and the Stovac
Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments 2010, Articles II(2), I(3) and III(4).

107

domestic law, the Tribunal accepts as apposite the approach suggested by Stephan
Schill, who proposes that:
“The sole relevant factor is whether MFN treatment applies or
whether it is subject to an explicit or implicit exception.
Furthermore, distinguishing between specifically negotiated
| provisions and other provisions would introduce different
classes of provisions within the same treaty period ... [there is]

| no room, for creating a specific class of ‘specifically negotiated’
| Provisions of the basic treaty that is per se immune from
|

circ ion by more favourable treatment in third-party

BITs, unless those provisions can be read as constituting an
exception to MFN treatment. 075
11.2.9 In this case, as earlier foreshadowed, the Tribunal considers that it would be

inappropriate to read-in an exception to MFN treatment by reason of the references in

the BIT to domestic law.

11.3 The Effective Means Standard

11.3.1 The “effective means standard” found in Article II(7) of the Treaty Between the
United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the
Encouragement and a Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 27 August 1993 (“US-

Ecuador BIT”) was considered in Chevron-Texaco v Ecuador”®.

11.3.2 The Chevron tribunal produced a comprehensive analysis of the meaning and

application of the “effective means” standard which can be summarised as follows:

(a) _ the “effective means” standard is lex specialis and is a distinct and potentially
less demanding test, in comparison to denial of justice in customary

international law;

*5 Stephan W Schill, “Multilateralizing Investment Treaties through Most-Favourite-Nation Clauses” (2009)

 

76 Article (7), which employs almost identical wording to that found in Article 4(5) of the India-Kuwait BIT,
provides that “each party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to
investment, investment agreements and investment authorizations.”

108

(h)

the standard requires both that the host State establish a proper system of laws

and institutions and that those systems work effectively in any given case;

a claimant alleging a breach of the effective means standard does not need to
establish that the host State interfered in judicial proceedings to establish a

breach;

indefinite or undue delay in the host State’s courts dealing with an investor’s

“claim” may amount to a breach of the effective means standard;

court congestion and backlogs are relevant factors to consider, but do not
constitute a complete defence. To the extent that the host State’s courts
experience regular and extensive delays, this may be. evidence of a systemic
problem with the court system, which would also constitute a breach of the

effective means standard;

the issue of whether or not “effective means” have been provided by the host

State is to be measured against an objective, international standard;

aclaimant alleging a breach of the standard does not need to prove that it has
exhausted local remedies. A claimant must, however, adequately utilise the
means available to it to assert claims and enforce rights. It will be up to the
host State to prove that local remedies are available and the claimant to show

that those remedies were ineffective or futile;

whether or not a delay in dealing with an investor’s claim breaches the

standard will depend on the facts of the case; and

11.3.3

11.4.1

11.4.2

11.4.3

(i) as with denial of justice under customary international law, some of the factors
that may be considered are the complexity of the case, the behaviour of the
litigants involved, the significance of the interests at stake in the case and the

behaviour of the courts themselves.

The Tribunal considers this description of the “effective means” standard to be

equally appropriate for application in this case.

Application of the Standard

White argued its case (for breach of the effective means standard) on the basis of
overall delay experienced to date from the beginning of the set aside and enforcement
proceedings, both of which commenced in September 2002. It did not seek to analyse
the two proceedings separately in connection with an assessment of “effective

means”.

In the set aside proceedings, even though Coal India was the applicant, White can
properly be described as having been “asserting claims” that the Indian courts lacked
set aside jurisdiction on the facts before them. In the enforcement proceedings,
however, White, as the applicant was acting to “enforce [its] rights” in connection
with the Award. That being the case, India was under an obligation to ensure it had

“effective means” to deal with its interests in each of the two proceedings.

Because Article 4(5) of the India-Kuwait BIT deals with effective means of asserting
claims and enforcing rights with respect to investments, the Tribunal considers it

more appropriate to examine each of the two proceedings on their own.

The Enforcement Proceedings

11.4.4

The history of the enforcement proceedings, which is not disputed, is as follows:

On 11 September 2002, White applied to the High Court at New Delhi to have
the Award enforced. On 13 September 2002, the registry cleared the
application for hearing, and on 16 September 2002, the matter was listed for

17 September 2002.

On 17 September 2002, White’s application was heard. The Delhi High Court
ordered that Coal India be given notice of the petition and, at the request of
White for a short return date, the matter was made returnable for 27 November

2002.

On 23 September 2002, White served Coal India with notice of application in

the High Court at New Delhi and filed its Affidavit of service.

On 27 November 2002, White’s application was heard in the Delhi High
Court. Coal India entered an appearance and requested that the court stay the
proceedings. The court did not stay the proceedings and directed Coal India to
file a short reply within three weeks, before 19 December 2002. The court
further ordered White to file a rejoinder to the reply before the next date of
hearing. The court ordered that the matter be listed for hearing on 14 February

2003.

On 14 February 2003, White’s application was heard. Coal India again
requested the court to stay the proceedings and further requested that it be
given additional time in which to file its reply. The court did not stay the
proceedings but granted Coal India one final opportunity to reply and ordered
Coal India to file a reply within three weeks, by 8 March 2003. The court
further ordered White to file a rejoinder in two weeks after Coal India had

filed its Reply. On the insistence of White for a short return date, the court

posted the matter for argument on 28 May 2003. Coal India further advised the
court that it would be filing an application to stay the enforcement proceedings
until the proceedings of the Calcutta High Court were decided. Coal India did

not file a reply within the stipulated timeframe.

On 22 March 2003, White applied to the court to have Coal India’s right to file
objections and a reply dismissed on the basis that Coal India had failed to file

its reply within the stipulated timeframe.

On 31 March 2003, White’s application to dismiss Coal India’s right to file a
reply was listed for hearing for 3 April 2003. At the hearing on that date Coal
India requested a further two weeks to file a reply which the court granted as

the final opportunity. The court further ordered that White file a rejoinder two

weeks thereafter and posted the matter for arguments on 20 May 2003.

On 21 April 2003, Coal India filed its reply and on 22 April 2003 applied for
an urgent stay of the enforcement proceedings, pending disposal of the set
aside proceedings in the Calcutta High Court. The Delhi High Court heard
Coal India’s reply on 20 May 2003. During the hearing, Coal India requested
the court to hear arguments on its application to stay the Delhi proceedings.
White contested the application for a stay and filed a reply. In view of the
pending proceedings in the Calcutta High Court, the Delhi High Court posted
the matter for arguments on 8 August 2003. White filed an Affidavit in
opposition to Coal India’s reply to its enforcement application on 5 August

2003.

On 28 January 2004, the court directed Coal India to file any objections to the
enforceability of the Award within three weeks, before 18 February 2004.

Coal India did not file its objections by 18 February 2004 and, on 11 May

2004 sought further time in which to do so. The court granted Coal India final
extension of two weeks until 1 June 2004. Coal India did not meet this further
deadline and on 7 July 2004, White filed an urgent application to dismiss Coal

India’s right to file any objections.

On 23 September 2004, Coal India filed its objections to White’s enforcement

application.

On 25 November 2004, White filed its reply to Coal India’s enforcement

objections.

On 30 November 2004, the court ordered Coal India to file its enforcement

rejoinder by 25 January 2005.

On 25 January 2005, Coal India not having filed its enforcement rejoinder,
White sought an order that it not be entitled to do so. Coal India requested
further time to do so and was granted a further three weeks. It was also
ordered to pay Rs 5,000 for failing to file its enforcement rejoinder as
required. At the same time, Coal India’s further request for the stay of the
enforcement proceedings (until after Coal India’s setting aside petition in the

Calcutta High Court had been heard) was declined.
On 17 February 2005, Coal India filed its enforcement rejoinder late.

On 10 May 2005, Coal India sought leave from the court for its late filed
enforcement rejoinder to be admitted to the record. It also renewed its request
for a stay of the Delhi High Court proceedings. The court listed Coal India’s
stay application for argument on 31 August 2005.

On 31 August 2005, Coal India’s renewed stay application was heard before
Mr Justice Kumar. The argument could not be concluded and, on consent, the

matter was postponed until 14 September 2005.

On 14 September 2005, during the hearing of the stay application, the court
asked Coal India why it had not filed its stay application in the Calcutta High
Court or the Supreme Court and why the Delhi high Court should stay the
proceedings when neither of the other courts had done so. Coal India was
granted time to take instructions on this question and 22 September 2005 was

fixed for disposal of the application.

The 22 September 2005 continuation of the stay application argument was
adjourned at the request of Coal India. Thereafter the matter was again

adjourned, this time at the request of White.

The stay application argument was taken up again on 8 November 2005 but

could not be concluded and the matter was adjourned until 22 November 2005.

The 22 November 2005 date for argument was adjourned on two further
occasions. The adjournments were granted at the request of Coal India and

White respectively as their counsel were not available.

Thereafter, Mr Justice Kumar, who had been hearing the stay application was
transferred to another bench. Coal India’s stay application was therefore

adjourned until 9 March 2006 before Mr Justice Lokur.

On 9 March 2006, following argument, the court directed that White’s
enforcement petition be stayed sine die, with leave to White to revive the
execution proceedings upon the decision of the Supreme Court or the High

114

(w)

Analysis

Court of Calcutta. Mr Justice Lokur was of the view that it would not be in the
interest of justice to invite conflicting decisions between the Calcutta High
Court and the Delhi High Court (this was a possibility, because the Supreme
Court, when it granted White’s leave to appeal application, refused to stay the
Calcutta set-aside proceedings). Lokur J went on to say that since the set aside
proceeding was pending in the Calcutta High Court, it would be appropriate
for him to restrain himself from proceeding further until the objections were
disposed of one way or another by that court. To his mind, since an earlier
petition was pending in the Calcutta High Court under Section 34 of the 1996
Act, it was required that the Delhi High Court proceeding be stayed until the

disposal of the proceedings in the Calcutta High Court.

White did not appeal this decision.

11.4.5 Itis fair to describe this procedural history as less than ideal. Coal India was allowed

to file its initial reply in an untimely manner; its formal objections were also permitted

to be filed late; and, thereafter, matters dragged on through the completion of the

parties’ further written submissions (reply and rejoinder) and the on-again-off-again

hearing of Coal India’s stay application. All of this took approximately three and a

half years. Thus, given the stay granted in March 2006, White’s enforcement

application remains unresolved more than nine years later.

11.4.6 However, on the facts before us, the Tribunal considers that the effective means

standard requires to be tested first against the three and a half year delay, before

looking at the six years of further delay.

115

11.4.7 Dealing only with the three and a half year period from September 2002 until the
March 2006 stay, the Tribunal concludes that it cannot be said that India failed to
provide White with effective means to enforce its rights simply because it took this

long to get to this point.

11.4.8 It is true that the Delhi court was generous with Coal India when it extended several
pleadings deadlines, but this accounts for only several months of the three and a half
years. The reality is that White’s application was being strenuously defended and the
pleadings schedule was not exceptional, either in the Indian context or otherwise.
Moreover, the length of time the Delhi court took in dealing with Coal India’s stay
application seems to have been attributable both to exigencies of a busy court docket
and the availability of counsel (both sides sought and were granted adjournments to

accommodate on several occasions).

11.4.9 Because White does not suggest that India has not established a proper system or laws
i and institutions, the question is, thus, whether the Delhi High Court worked
effectively in handling White’s enforcement application. This turns on the question of
whether White’s enforcement application was subject to “indefinite” or “undue” delay
(during this three and a half year period).”” And, for the reasons noted above, the

Tribunal thinks not.

i 11.4.10 With regard to the further six years of delay following the stay, which, on its face,
seems excessive, it is important to consider the relevance of White’s decision not to

appeal the order of Mr Justice Lokur.

__—___- —-____--

” The Tribunal agrees with the Chevron tribunal that “For any ‘means’ of asserting claims or enforcing rights to be
effective, it must not be subject to indefinite or undue delay. Undue delay in effect amounts to a denial of access to
these means.”

116

11.4.11 It is common ground that White had a right of appeal from this decision. That being
the case, India has shown the availability of local remedies. Given that White chose
not to appeal, it was therefore for it to show that such an appeal would have been

ineffective or futile.

11.4.12 But on this point, no evidence was offered. Moreover, it cannot be said that any
appeal would have been futile or ineffective just because White had already appealed
to the Supreme Court on its denied jurisdictional objection. The question to be
determined in an appeal against Lokur J’s order would have been different than that

raised on the jurisdictional appeal.

11.4.13 Put another way, because the issue that had earlier been placed before the Supreme
Court related only to the jurisdiction of the Indian courts to take on set aside
applications in respect of foreign awards, there is no evidence before the Tribunal (or
other basis) upon which it can properly conclude: (a) that the Divisional Court, or
indeed the Supreme Court would not have dealt with an appeal from the order of
Justice Lokur in a timely manner (the question it would have had to address would
have been a straight forward one - i.e., the propriety of staying White’s enforcement

application; or (b) what the outcome of that appeal might have been.

i 11.4.14 In these circumstances, White having failed to show that an appeal of the stay order

 

would have been ineffective or futile, the Tribunal concludes that the further six years
of delay is to be disregarded in its assessment of whether India failed to provide to

White effective means of enforcing its rights under the Award.

11.4.15 Based on this analysis, the Tribunal holds that White has not shown that India failed

to provide effective means for it to enforce its rights under the Award.

117

 

 

The Set Aside Proceedings

11.4.16 The question of whether White’s claims in the set aside proceedings (i.e. that the
Calcutta High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Coal India’s application to set
aside the award) were subject to indefinite or undue delay is, however, another matter

entirely.”

11.4.17 In his opening, when discussing the delay White has faced in the Supreme Court, Mr
Landau said that it was extraordinary that it had not made a further application for
expedition after the hearing of 16 January 2008, or not made an appointment with the
Chief Justice of India to complain about the pace of proceedings.” To the Tribunal’s

mind, these steps were not required.

11.4.18 Having already applied for and obtained an order for expedited hearings in 2006 and
2007, White appears to have done everything that could reasonably be expected of it
to have the Supreme Court deal with its appeal in a timely manner. Mr Bonnell made
the point in his closing speech, with which the Tribunal agrees, that there was no
effective course open to White to seek to expedite the appeal further. He noted that:

“Tt has already been granted the right to an early
appeal. That happened, comically, five and a half years
ago. The matter sits in the court’s weekly list, which is
where expedited appeals go.”

11.4.19 In these circumstances, and even though we have decided that the nine years of

proceedings in the set aside application do not amount to a denial of justice, the

7* As already noted, the “effective means” standard is different from and less demanding than the “denial of justice”
standard. Moreover, with respect to a forward looking promise by a State to provide “effective means” of enforcing
rights and making claims, the relevance of the State’s population or the current operation of its court system(s) (in
assessing the undueness of a delay) is limited. This is because the focus of such a lex specialis is whether the system
of laws and institutions work effectively at the time the promisee seeks to enforce its rights / make its claims.

Tribunal has no difficulty in concluding the Indian judicial system’s inability to deal
with White’s jurisdictional claim in over nine years, and the Supreme Court’s
inability to hear White’s jurisdictional appeal for over five years amounts to undue
delay and constitutes a breach of India’s voluntarily assumed obligation of providing

White with “effective means” of asserting claims and enforcing rights.

11.4.20 Accordingly, India is in breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT.

12. ARTICLE 7 - EXPROPRIATION

12.1

12.1.1

12.2

12.2.1

12.3

12.3.1

Article 7(1) of the BIT
Article 7(1) provides that:
“neither Contracting Party shall nationalise, expropriate or
subject to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation
or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as ‘expropriation’) the
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party except
for a public purpose, on a non-discriminatory basis, in
accordance with its laws and against fair and equitable
compensation.”
White argues that India has expropriated its investment in India, in breach of Article
7(1) of the BIT. Originally, in its Notice of Arbitration, White alleged only that the

Award had been expropriated. However, in its Memorial it claims that its rights in

relation to the Contract and Bank Guarantee have also been expropriated.

Expropriation of the Bank Guarantees
Having regard to the Tribunal’s conclusion that the Bank Guarantees do not constitute
an investment for the purpose of the BIT, it follows that India cannot be found in

breach of its obligations under Article 7(1) in that regard.

Expropriation of the Contract

India’s first point in connection with the alleged expropriation of White’s contractual

119

 

12.3.2

12.3.3

12.3.4

rights is that the only form of contractual rights that are capable of being expropriated
are those that are a form of intangible property such as “a right over natural resources

granted by a public act of the host state”.*!

The Tribunal disagrees. In the case of Phillips Petroleum Co v Iran (16 Yearbook
Commercial Arbitration 75 (1989), Award, 12 June 1989), a case relied upon by
White, the tribunal was concerned with the termination of a development agreement
for the exploitation of natural resources. The tribunal concluded that contractual
rights, whether tangible or intangible, are capable of being expropriated:

“Expropriation by or attributable to a state of the property of

an alien gives rise under international law to liability... and

this is so whether the property is tangible ... or intangible,

such as the contract rights involved in the present case

(emphasis added).”
In similar circumstances to the present case, the tribunal in Saipem determined that
the residual contract rights arising from the investment, as crystallised in the ICC

Award, were an “investment” within the BIT’s definition and were also capable of

spe 82
expropriation. ©

For White, the relevant test as to whether expropriation has occurred is the effect of
the government’s action on the investor’s investment. However, it is not clear
whether White considers that an expropriation should be identified by its impact on

the value of an investment, or by its impact on the rights of the investor and the

120

investment.®?

12.3.5 For India, the correct test does not consider the value of the investment, but rather the
impact of the State’s behaviour on the rights of the investor in the investment. The
test therefore, as to whether there has been indirect expropriation (there is no
suggestion of direct expropriation in this case), is whether there has been a substantial

deprivation of the investors’ rights in the investment.

12.3.6 The Tribunal is not required to choose between these two competing tests because of
its conclusion that neither the value of White’s investment (whether it be its rights in
the Contract or as crystalised in the Award) nor its rights under the Contract (as
crystalised in the Award) have been substantially affected by the fact that the Indian
Courts have yet to dispose of either Coal India’s set-aside application or White’s
Application for Enforcement of the Award. The Award has not been “taken” or set
aside. All that has happened is that the determination of its validty has not yet

occurred. This does not sound in expropriation.

13. ARTICLE 9 - FREE TRANSFER OF FUNDS

13.1 Article 9 of the BIT

13.1.1 Article 9 of the BIT provides that:
“each Contracting Party shall permit all funds of an investor of
the other Contracting Party related to an investment in its
territory to be freely transferred without unreasonable delay
and on a non-discriminatory basis ...”

13.2 Claim Based on Conduct of Coal India

13.2.1 White’s case for breach of Article 9 of the BIT is based upon the conduct of Coal

® By reliance on the awards in Compangia des Arrollo de Santa Elena v. Costa Rica and Metalclad Corporation v
Mexico, White appears to consider that what is important is whether the value of the investment is adversely effected.

121

 

India in calling on the Bank Guarantees, and its subsequent retention of those funds

following the making of the Award.

13.2.2. The Tribunal concludes this claim must fail.

13.2.3 Apart from the fact that Article 9 is clearly aimed at restrictions on the movement of
capital and exchange of currency imposed by a Contracting Party, rather than the
assertion of a contractual right to funds provided for in a bank guarantee, the claim is

entirely based on the conduct of Coal India.

13.2.4 Accordingly, the Tribunal having determined that the conduct of Coal India is not
attributable to the Republic, there is no basis for a claim that India acted in any way in

breach of its obligations created by Article 9 of the BIT.

14. COMPENSATION

14.1 Questions to be addressed by the Tribunal

14.1.1 The Tribunal addresses two questions in this Section as follows:

(a) is the Award enforceable under the laws of India; and

(b) _ ifso, what compensation is required to restore White to the position it would

have enjoyed had India’s breach of the BIT not occurred?

14.2 Enforceability of the Award in India
14.2.1 India says that White is not entitled to compensation, even if breach of the BIT is
found, because White has not demonstrated that Coal India’s setting aside application

and motion to resist enforcement have no prospects of success.

14.2.2 During the course of the oral hearing (against the possibility of a finding of BIT

122

 

breach by India), the Tribunal asked the parties whether they considered that it was in
a position, without further evidence or submissions, to determine whether the Award
was enforceable in India. The parties agreed that sufficient material had been
provided to the Tribunal to enable it to undertake this task, if it arose, and that it

should determine the question in that event.

Grounds for Resisting Enforcement

14.2.3. Coal India relies on four grounds for resisting enforcement. These are:

(a) the ICC tribunal’s bias — based on the chairman’s alleged gross misconduct

during the proceedings;

(b) _ the tribunal having exceeded its jurisdiction — by asking the parties five
additional questions following the first hearing (these are said to be beyond the

Terms of Reference) and holding an additional hearing;

(c) delay — the Award was not issued within six months of the execution of the
Terms of Reference and was, thus, not in accordance with the arbitral

procedure agreed by the parties; and

(d) _ the Award being contrary to Indian public policy — because of the apparent
bias of Mr Abrahamson and the “illegal application of Indian law” (i.e., what

is said to be the clearly flawed reasoning of the Tribunal).

14.2.4 Before dealing with these four issues, it is necessary to set out a short procedural

history of the ICC arbitration.

History of ICC Arbitration

14.2.5 On 28 June 1999, White submitted its Request for Arbitration, in which it sought: (a)

123

payment of A$3,203,873 as payment for the bonus under the Contract; (b)
A$2,772,640 in connection with the wrongful retention of the performance guarantee;

(c) interest; and (d) costs.
14.2.6 After this (it is not clear on what date), Coal India submitted its Answer.

14.2.7. On 20 September 1999, Coal India submitted its Counter-Claim, in which Coal India

claimed payment of A$7,940,720 and interest.
14.2.8 On 12 December 1999, White submitted its Answer to Coal India’s Counter-claim.
14.2.9 On 6 March 2000, the Terms of Reference were settled.
14,2.10 A hearing, attended by both parties, was held in Paris between 15 and 25 May 2000.

14.2.11 On 25 May 2000, White provided to the tribunal its "Claim for Bonus on CHP", its

"Claim for Bonus on CPP”, and a document headed “Total Moisture.”
14.2.12 On 26 June 2000, Coal India submitted its Reply in Rejoinder to White’s new claim.

14.2.13 On 11 July 2000, White submitted a summary of the costs which it had incurred in the

arbitration.

14.2.14 On 21 July 2000, White submitted its Reply to Coal India's Counter Claim and its

Reply to Coal India’s Reply in Rejoinder.

14.2.15 On 4 August 2000, Coal India submitted a summary of the costs which it had incurred

in the arbitration.

14.2.16 On 30 October 2001, the Chairman of the Tribunal wrote to the parties, requesting

that the parties make submissions on all or any of five questions. The Chairman

124

requested that the parties provide submissions by 30 November 2001, and any reply to
the other party's submission within 14 days of receiving the submissions. The
Chairman noted that a further hearing would then be held in Paris on 9 January 2002.

The five questions raised by the Tribunal were:

“1. Is it open to the Tribunal to assess the probative
value of the recorded sampling and test results,
and determine the actual ash or moisture content
of coal produced: Or is the Tribunal bound by,
or to choose between, any party figures
submitted for such ash or moisture content?

2. Where relevant, what numbers, places and kinds
of samples and tests are sufficient to prove the
actual ash and moisture content of a day's

production, And for what days is such proof
available?

3. Is the Tribunal entitled to disregard a trivial
excess over limit in a day’s production?

4. If the actual ash or moisture content of any day's
production has not been proven, is the production
of that day to be treated as Beneficiated or non-
Beneficiated for bonus/penalty?

5. Do the ICC Rules, the Terms of Reference or
applicable principles of pleading bar any case
relied upon by either party on any of these
questions, absolutely or subject to any discretion
of the Tribunal?”

14.2.17 On 29 November 2001, Coal India submitted a challenge pursuant to Article 12(1) of
the ICC Rules, requesting that the ICC reconstitute the tribunal and recommence the
proceedings, de novo. Coal India asserted that the new questions issued by the
tribunal gave rise to a serious apprehension of bias. This appears to be on the basis
that: (a) the tribunal’s questions "did not arise and were not mentioned in the Terms of
Reference"; (b) were not issues which had been raised by the parties; and (c)
consequently, it was not “proper for the Tribunal to try and make out a case which

was never pleaded by the parties."

14.2.18 On 30 November 2001, White submitted its submissions in response to the tribunal's

request of 30 October 2001.

14.2.19 On 30 November 2001, White wrote to the ICC, noting that it did not agree with Coal

India's challenge to the tribunal.

14.2.20 On 3 December 2001, the ICC wrote to White and the tribunal, requesting comments

on Coal India's application to reconstitute the tribunal.

14.2.21 On 3 and 4 December 2001, Mr Morling QC (one of the tribunal members), wrote to
the ICC (copied to the parties). Mr Morling stated his view that there was no basis for

Coal India’s challenge.

14.2.22 On 3 December 2001, Justice Reddy (one of the tribunal members), replied to the
ICC, in relation to Coal India's challenge to the tribunal. Justice Reddy was not

prepared to agree that there was evidence of bias.

14.2.23 On 6 December 2001, White wrote to the ICC in relation to the ICC's request for
comments on Coal India's application to reconstitute the tribunal. In its letter, White

noted that there was no basis to Coal India's challenge.

14.2.24 On 17 December 2001, the ICC wrote to the parties to advise that the Court would

consider Coal India's challenge at the Plenary Session in December 2001.

14.2.25 On 20 December 2001, the ICC wrote to the parties and the tribunal, stating that:

"The ICC International Court of Arbitration, at its Plenary
Session of 20 December 2001 and pursuant to Article 12(3) of
the ICC Rules of Arbitration, decided to reject the challenge
filed by Respondent against the Arbitral Tribunal.”

14.2.26 On 20 December 2001, Coal India wrote to the tribunal requesting an adjournment of

126

LL. .

the hearing set for 9 and 10 January 2002. This request was rejected by the tribunal in

its letter dated 21 December 2001.

14.2.27 On 9 and 10 January 2002, a hearing was held in Paris in relation to the questions

raised by the tribunal on 30 October 2001, which both parties attended.

14.2.28 On 16 January 2002, Coal India submitted its "Submissions on Behalf of the

Respondent/Counter-Claimant”.

14.2.29 On 21 January 2002, White submitted its "Final Submission in Response to the
Tribunal's Request dated 30 October 2001," in reply to Coal India's submissions of 16
January 2002. On 24 January 2002, White submitted an updated summary of its costs

in the arbitration.

14.2.30 On 3 February 2002, Coal India sent to the tribunal and White, its "Submission in
Response to the tribunal's Request Dated 30 October 2001". In its submissions, Coal
India addressed each of the questions raised by the tribunal in the tribunal's letter of

30 October 2001.

14.2.31 On 22 February 2002, Coal India submitted an updated summary of its costs in the

arbitration.
14.2.32 On 27 May 2002, the tribunal issued its Award.

Grounds for Refusing to Enforce an Award
14.2.33 Before reviewing the alleged grounds on which Coal India relies for setting aside/not
enforcing the Award, it is to be noted that, under the New York Convention (and the

1996 Act):

(a) the Award may only properly be refused, if one of the (exhaustive) grounds set

127

 

_——_— tL --_--—

(b)

out in the Convention (or the 1996 Act) is established®™*; and

the onus is firmly on Coal India to establish the existence of such grounds.

14.2.34 Pursuant to Article V of the Convention, the enforcement of the Award may be

refused, at the request of Coal India, only if Coal India furnishes to the competent

authority (in this case the Tribunal) proof that:

(a)

(b)

the parties to [the arbitration] agreement were, under some incapacity, or the
agreement itself is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected
it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the

Award was made (no such issue is raised here); or

the party against whom the Award is invoked was not given proper notice of
the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was

otherwise unable to present his case (no such issue is raised here); or

the Award deals with a difference not contemplated by, or not falling within ,
the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters

beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; or

the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in
accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, was
not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place;

or

the Award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or

® The grounds in the Convention and the 1996 Act are virtually identical.

128

suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law

of which, the Award was made (no such issue is raised here).

Allegations of Tribunal Bias
14.2.35 Although it is unclear which ground of the New York Convention (or the 1996 Act),
Coal India is seeking to invoke in connection with its assertion of tribunal bias it must

be either (c) or (d) above.

14.2.36 Coal India’s contentions of bias appear to be based on: (a) the fact that the Award was
reserved for 17 months, following which further questions were issued and a further
hearing held on those issues; (b) the majority of the Tribunal having failed to act
impartially and having committed serious misconduct in law; and (c) the Chairman

having issued a response to Justice Reddy’s dissenting opinion.

14.2.37 India contends, and the Tribunal agrees, that the test for bias to be applied by the
Tribunal is that which the Indian courts would have applied in determining Coal

India’s allegations of bias.

 

14.2.38 Justice Srikrishna sets out the applicable test in the following terms:

“The test of bias under the 1996 Act is the same as that
under the general law of India. The question is not
whether the judge or an arbitrator is actually biased or
has decided partially, but whether the circumstances are
i such as to create a reasonable apprehension in the
minds of others that there is a likelihood of bias affecting
the decision. If there is a reasonable likelihood of bias it
is in accordance with natural justice and common sense
{ that the judge or the arbitrator is likely to be so bias
| should not be permitted to sit. The basic principle

 

129

 

underlying this rule is that justice must not only be done
but must also appear to be done. 85

14.2.39 Having regard to this test, the Tribunal sees no basis for concluding that either the

Chairman or Mr Morling were biased.

14.2.40 The mere fact that 17 months had elapsed and further questions were then asked does
not show or prove bias. Moreover, the responses by the arbitrators to the ICC Court
(when it was dealing with the bias issue) detailed the reasons why further questions
were needed to be asked and reject totally any bias on their part. The Tribunal has no

reason not to accept those responses as being anything other than truthful.

14.2.41 In addition, the questions do not appear to have been issued by the Chairman on some
whim, without involving (or contrary to the wishes of) his co-arbitrators, as India
implies. Instead, it appears that the questions are as likely to have emanated from
Justice Reddy, as he was concerned about Coal India having an opportunity to address

those issues.*°

14.2.42 It is also apparent that the procedure adopted by the tribunal (in raising further
questions) was foreshadowed at the conclusion of the May 2000 hearing where the

Chairman stated:

§ Additional Expert Report of Justice Srikrisna, para. 28. White referred to the decision in Suez, Sociedad General de
Aguas de Barcelona SA, InterAguas Servicios Integranes del Aguas SA, Vivendi Universal SA v Argentina Republic as
somehow setting out the test which the Indian courts should apply to determine Coal India’s allegation of bias. The
reference to the Suez case seems to ignore the fact that the Tribunal, in determining the enforceability of the Award
sits, in effect, as an Indian court which, in considering bias, would do so from the perspective of bias under Indian
law.

86 tn his letter dated 3 December 2001 (in response to the ICC’s request for comments on Coal India’s allegation that
the questions issued by the Tribunal demonstrated bias), Mr Abrahamson noted that “the three members of the
Tribunal have agreed the issues for the hearing, as fully covering Justice Reddy’s objections”. Also, in his comments
on Justice Reddy’s dissent, the Chairman notes: I regret particularly that having demanded an additional hearing to
deal with his complaints, and the hearing having been arranged and conducted with his full agreement and
participation, Mr Justice Reddy alleges in his Opinion after the hearing is over that even it ‘does not improve the
matter”.

130

re

“\.. there is a lot of material anyway for us to absorb. If

in the course of reviewing that material, speaking for

myself, I have any new thoughts or any mathematical or,

practical, or legal points strike me which I feel we did

not put to the parties during opening, then I will

certainly raise them. In the process of doing that, I think

the only way to deal with the position is that I will

attempt to ensure that everybody gets an opportunity to

reply to new points. 087

14.2.43 There was no objection from the parties to such an approach, at the time. Further, it is

impossible to see how the questions raised any inference that a tribunal member might
have been prejudiced against one or other party. The questions are precisely that:
questions. They do not pre-suppose a particular answer. Indeed, as contended by
White, it might just as easily have said that the questions showed bias against it. The

truth of the matter is that the questions show no evidence of bias against either party.

14.2.44 As noted by Mr Morling and Justice Reddy, the mere asking of questions by the
tribunal does not evidence bias. Further, Coal India entirely fails to explain how the
preparation of a response by the Chairman to Justice Reddy’s dissent could amount to

bias.

14.2.45 In this case, after carefully examining the various allegations of bias and misconduct
made by Coal India, the Tribunal concludes that it has failed to establish, either: (a)
that there was bias in this case; or (b) that its allegations satisfy the requirements in

the New York Convention to decline to enforce the Award.

Excess of Jurisdiction
14.2.46 Coal India contends that the ICC tribunal “made an award which is beyond the scope

and Terms of Reference and/or contains decisions on matters beyond the cope of the

*’ Transcript of hearing on 25 May 2000, page 69.

131

 

submission to arbitration”.**

14,2.47 This contention appears to be based on the assertions that: (a) the questions raised by
the Tribunal, by its letter of 30 October 2011, were outside the scope of the Terms of
Reference or the Request for Arbitration; (b) having regard to the parties’ evidence
and submissions, it was not open to the Tribunal to evaluate the test results; and (c)

the Award is based on contentions which were contrary to its submissions.

14.2.48 Although it is not entirely clear from the submissions made by Coal India in the Delhi
and Calcutta High Courts, Coal India seems to have argued that: (a) as the parties did
not expressly plead that, on the days when less than six samples were taken in
accordance with Indian Standard 436, the ICC tribunal ought to conclude that there
was insufficient evidence to find that non-beneficiated coal was produced for the
purposes of determining the penalty payable by White; and (b) as the ICC tribunal
adopted this approach in its Award, that award is outside the scope of the Terms of

Reference.

14.2.49 Coal India’s current objection to enforcement on this basis must fall under Article

V(1)(c) of the New York Convention.

14.2.50 Article V(1)(c) of the Convention (as well as sections 34(1) and 34(1))(iv) and

48(1)(c) of the 1996 Act) contains two limbs, namely:

(a) the Award deals with a “difference” or “dispute” not contemplated by, or not

falling within, the terms of submission to arbitration (“first limb”); and

(b) _ the Award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of submission to

*8 See Coal India’s Application to Set Aside the Award to the Calcutta High Court, dated 9 September 2002.

132

arbitration (“second limb”).

14.2.51 For the reasons noted below, the Tribunal concludes that Coal India has failed to

establish that either of these limbs is satisfied in the present case.

14.2.52 In relation to the first limb, the “difference” or “dispute” submitted to arbitration
includes the question of what, if any, penalty or bonus White was entitled to receive
or liable to pay. This is evident from a review of the Terms of Reference and the
submissions and evidence of the parties. Moreover, this is precisely the “difference”

or “dispute” which the ICC tribunal decided in the Award.

14.2.53 In relation to the second limb, as the “difference” or “dispute” was properly referred
to the ICC tribunal, its decision in the Award as to what, if any, penalty or bonus
White was entitled to receive, or liable to pay, cannot be said to be a decision on a
matter “beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration”. Both parties made

extensive submissions on the issue and two hearings were held.

14.2.54 In any event, the argument which appears now to be put in issue by Coal India (that
on the days when less than six samples were taken, the tribunal could conclude that
there was insufficient evidence for it to find that non-beneficiated coal had been

produced), was clearly and expressly raised by White in its submissions.

14.2.55 On these facts, it must follow that the tribunal’s decision on the issue of the
penalty/bonus which should flow from the Contract was within its jurisdiction.
Likewise, the tribunal raised the issue of what should happen if the requirements for

penalty/bonus were not established and the parties made submissions on that issue.

14.2.56 In consequence, it is not now open to India to argue that the Award dealt with a
difference not contemplated by or falling within the terms of the submission to

133

arbitration, or contained decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to

arbitration.

Delay
14.2.57 The delay argument asserted by Coal India and relied upon now by India was raised
for the first time before the Calcutta High Court in Coal India’s setting aside

application.

14.2.58 In that application, Coal India contended that the Award was “‘vitiated” by the
“inordinate delay” in issuing the Award. In its Reply Memorial in these proceedings,
India bases its delay argument on the Award not having been issued in accordance
with the arbitral procedure agreed by the parties, as it was not issued “within six

months from the signing of the Terms of Reference”.

14.2.59 It is true that Article 24 of the ICC Rules provides that an arbitral tribunal must render
its final award within six months from the date of the last signature by the arbitral

tribunal or by the parties of the Terms of Reference.

14.2.60 However, this rule must be read in conjunction with the provisions of Article 33 of

the ICC Rules which state that:

“a party which proceeds with the arbitration without
raising its objection to a failure to comply with any
provision of these Rules, or of any other rules applicable
to the proceedings, any direction given by the Arbitral
Tribunal, or any requirement under the arbitration
agreement relating to the constitution of the Arbitral
Tribunal, or to the conduct of the proceedings, shall be
deemed to have waived its right to object.”

| 14.2.61 The Tribunal also takes notice of the fact that it is the norm in ICC proceedings for

tribunals to issue their awards outside of the six month period allowed by the Rules.

134

 

14.2.62 This is because it is only in the rarest of cases that the parties and the tribunal will be
in a position to get out an award within this six month period. Accordingly, the ICC
Court routinely corresponds with the parties during the course of an arbitration to

advise that it has extended the six month period in which the award may be issued.

14.2.63 It is true that the record before us does not contain such correspondence from the
ICC Court extending the time limit in this case. However, given the absence of any
evidence of complaint by Coal India as to the non-compliance by the Tribunal with
the provisions of Article 24, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that Coal India
consented to the tribunal’s jurisdiction to issue the Award after the expiration of the
six month period. In any event, by reason of Article 33, it has waived its right to do

so.

14.2.64 In these circumstances, it is not now open to India to argue that the Award was not in
accordance with the arbitral procedure agreed by the parties, contrary to Article

‘V(1)(d) of the New York Convention.

Public Policy of India
14.2.65 Coal India’s arguments that the Award is in conflict with the public policy of India is

based on its assertion that the tribunal was biased and that the Award is therefore

illegal. Having regard to the Tribunal’s conclusion above on bias, this ground for not

enforcing the Award falls away.

Conclusions on Enforceability

14.2.66 Having determined that none of the four grounds advanced by Coal India for resisting

enforcement of the Award support such an outcome, the Tribunal concludes that the

Award is enforceable under the laws of India.

White’s Entitlement to Compensation

In its Statement of Defence, India contends that White cannot demonstrate that it has
suffered any loss as, even if the Calcutta High Court had declined jurisdiction to set
aside the Award this would still have left White Industries with the task of persuading

the Delhi Courts that the ICC Award should be enforced in India.

For present purposes, that requires White to have persuaded the Tribunal that the

Award should be enforced, and it has.

In accordance with international law, White is thus entitled to be restored to the
position it would have enjoyed had the breach of the BIT not occurred (see, The

Chorzow Factory case (Germany v Poland), 1928 P.C.LJ. No. 17).

In the present case, had India not failed to provide White with “effective means” of
asserting its claims, the Indian courts ought by now to have determined the Award to

be enforceable in India.
Had this occurred, White would:
(a) have received the sums due to it under the Award, including interest;

(b) not have incurred the costs which it has incurred in pursuing litigation through

the Indian courts;

(c) not have incurred the costs which it has incurred in attempting to settle the

dispute with India, and

(d) not have incurred the costs in bringing this arbitration.

14.3.6 Having reached the conclusion that an Indian court, acting reasonably and complying

136

 

 

|

with India’s international obligations, would conclude that Coal India had not
established that the Award ought to be set aside or not enforced, the Tribunal
determines that White is entitled to full compensation for the loss it has suffered as a

consequence of India’s breach of the BIT. This compensation includes:

(a) the amount of A$ 4,085,180 payable under the Award;

(b) interest on this amount at the rate of 8% from 24 March 1998 until the date of

payment;

(c) the amount of US$ 84,000 payable under the Award (for the fees and expenses

of the Arbitrators); and

(d) _ the amount of A$ 500,000 payable under the Award (for White’s costs in the

ICC arbitration);

15. COSTS

15.1.1

15.1.2

Parties’ Statements of Costs
In response to the Tribunal’s request, each of the parties submitted statements and
proposed allocations of costs on 14 October 2011. As noted above, Respondent

commented on Claimant’s statement on 21 October 2011.

Claimant submits that the proper approach to be adopted by the Tribunal in this case
is that each party ought to bear its own legal costs®, except that Respondent ought to

bear all of the costs and expenses of Claimant’s witnesses.”

® This approach was said to be common in investment treaty arbitrations. The fact that the issues were novel and
complex and that the arbitration was conducted efficiently was cited in support.

* Claimant argued in support of this proposition that it had suggested that all witnesses be examined by video
conference, and no examination was, in the end, conducted.

137

15.1.3 In the event that the Tribunal should decide to award costs on the basis that “costs
follow the event”, Claimant claims a total of A$ 923,040.75 and US$ 52,374. These

amounts were broken down as follows:

(a) | Mallesons’ legal fees A$ 787,543.20

| (b) Mallesons’ disbursements A$ 49,247.73
(c) Luthra & Luthra legal fees US$ 52,374.00
(d) Witness fees and expenses A$ 86,249.82

15.1.4 Respondent sought an award of costs on the basis that costs should follow the event. It

claimed:

(a) Fox Mandal legal fees and expenses INR 13,020,513.00

(b) Counsel fees GBE 465,022.44
(c) Witness fees and expenses INR 2,523,766.00
and arbitration expenses US$ 8,394.00

SG$ 535.00

GBE£ 12,628.00

15.1.5 In its comments on Claimant’s bill of costs, Respondent submitted that there is no
reason to depart from the normal rule that costs should follow the event. It also argued
that there is no basis for Claimant’s attempt to have Respondent bear the whole cost
of the evidence when the decision that no witnesses should be cross-examined was

taken by both parties.

15.2 Decision on Costs

 

| 15.2.1 Article 12(3)(vii) of the BIT provides that:

~ “Each Party concerned shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator
and its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of

the Chairperson in discharging his or her arbitral function and
the remaining costs of the tribunal shall be borne equally by the

138

 

15.2.2

15.2.3

15.2.4

15.2.5

Parties concerned. The tribunal may, however, in its decision
direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of
the two Parties, and this award shall be binding on both
Parties.”
Under Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal is directed to fix

the costs of the arbitration in its award. The term “costs”, as defined, includes the

various heads of fees and expenses claimed by the parties.

Pursuant to Article 40 of the Rules, the costs of the arbitration (other than the costs of
legal representation and assistance — which are to be dealt with pursuant to Article
40(2), which is to say, in its discretion) shall, in principle, be borne by the

unsuccessful party.

However, pursuant to Article 38(e) of the Rules, the Tribunal may make an award in
favour of the successful party for its costs of legal representation and assistance only

if such costs are claimed in the arbitration proceedings.

This being the case, White having prevailed but having taken the position that costs
(except for witness expenses) should follow the event, the Tribunal concludes that
each party should bear its own costs with the exception of those relating to Claimant’s
witness fees and expenses. As to the latter, India shall pay these fees and expenses in

the amount of A$ 86,249.82.
