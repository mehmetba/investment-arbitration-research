The State of Ukraine was ordered to pay VEB.RF State Development Corporation an application fee
of EUR 4,000; the Emergency Arbitrator’s fee of EUR 16,000; and the applicant’s reasonable costs of
legal services in connection with the application, which shall be subject to assessment unless agreed
(Vol 1, pp 31-52).

Given that the debtor failed to voluntarily comply with this arbitral award, on 19 September 2019, the
applicant applied to the Kyiv Court of Appeal for the recognition and enforcement of the award.

On 20 September 2019, the Kyiv Court of Appeal sent a copy of the application and annexes to the
debtor’s address and invited the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine to file its objections to the application
within one month.

However, the debtor failed to submit any objections within the time limit fixed by the court.

By order of the judge of the Kyiv Court of Appeal of 30 October 2019, the application of VEB.RF State
Development Corporation was appointed for hearing at the court’s premises.

By order of 18 December 2019, the Kyiv Court of Appeal granted the request of the Ministry of Justice of
Ukraine and stayed the proceedings in case No 824/178/19 on the application of Oleksandr Mykhailovych
Denysenko (acting in the interests of VEB.RF State Development Corporation) for the recognition and
enforcement of the 28 August 2019 award of the Emergency Arbitrator of the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in case No 2019/113 concerning the claim of VEB.RF State
Development Corporation against the State of Ukraine (in the person of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine)
ordering interim measures, pending consideration by the Arbitration Institute of the Chamber of Commerce
of Stockholm (Sweden) of the application of the State of Ukraine (Respondent) for the annulment of the 28
August 2019 award of the Emergency Arbitrator of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce in case No 2019/113.

By order of the Kyiv Court of Appeal of 6 March 2020, the stay of the proceedings was lifted due to the
termination of the circumstances on which it was based.

At the hearing, the appli *s, ive supported the

and d that it be upheld.

The debtor’s representative objected to the application.

After hearing the views of the hearing participants and examining the case record, the court concludes that
the application must be refused for the following reasons.

The court has established that, on 27 November 1998, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the
Government of the Russian Federation signed the Agreement on encouragement and mutual protection of
investments, which was ratified by Law of Ukraine No 1302-XIV On the ratification of the Agreement
between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Government of the Russian Federation on
encouragement and mutual protection of investments of 15 December 1999. Article 9 of the Agreement
provides that, in case of any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other
Contracting Party, which may arise in connection with investments, including disputes concerning the
amount, conditions of and procedure for payment of compensation provided for in Article 5 of this
Agreement, or the procedure for effecting a transfer of payments provided for in Article 7 of this
Agreement, shall be notified in writing accompanied with detailed comments, which the investor shall

forward to the Contracting Party involved in the dispute. The parties to the dispute shall endeavour to settle
such dispute by way of negotiations. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations within six

months from the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph | of this Article, the dispute shall
be submitted, inter alia, to the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

On 14 September 2018, VEB.RF State Development Corporation sent a notice of dispute to Ukraine, in
accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement.

On 21 August 2019, VEB.RF State Development Corporation applied to the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce for the appointment of an Emergency Arbitrator and a request for
provisional measures before the submission of the dispute to an Arbitral Tribunal.

The 28 August 2019 decision of the Emergency Arbitrator of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm
Chamber of Commerce ordered the State of Ukraine (in the person of the Chief Public Bailiff of the
execution section of the Department of the State Enforcement Service of the Ministry of Justice of
Ukraine) to halt the forced sale of shares of Prominvestbank PJSC registered in the name of VEB.RF
State Development Corporation, including in order to collect the debt of the Russian Federation under
any arbitral or judicial decision, and to refrain from any equivalent actions with respect to the shares
of Prominvestbank PJSC pending the Arbitral Tribunal’s decision in its final arbitral award on
whether such sale is contrary to international law. The State of Ukraine was ordered to pay VEB.RF
State Development Corporation an application fee of EUR 4,000; the Emergency Arbitrator’s fee of EUR
16,000; and the applicant’s reasonable costs of legal services in connection with the application, which
shall be subject to assessment unless agreed (Vol 1 pp 31-52).

According to Article 9(1) of Appendix II to the SCC Arbitration Rules, the award shall remain
unchanged and shall be binding on the parties, except as provided in Article 9(4) of Appendix II to the
SCC Arbitration Rules (paragraph 1.6 of the award).

It is established that the debtor has failed to comply with the award voluntarily.
In view of this, the applicant requested the court to enforce the said foreign arbitral award.

The disputed legal relations in this dispute are regulated by the 1958 New York Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign [Arbitral] Awards ratified by Ukraine on 10 August 1960,
the Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce which entered into
force for Ukraine on 7 June 1959, the Agreement on encouragement and mutual protection of
investments, which was ratified by Law of Ukraine No 1302-XIV On the ratification of the
Agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Government of the Russian
Federation on encouragement and mutual protection of investments of 15 December 1999.

According to Article V(1) of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of
Foreign [Arbitral] Awards, recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request
of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where
the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that:

- The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the
agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the
country where the arbitration took place; or

- The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the
arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case;

- The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the
submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
arbitration.

Furthermore, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the same Convention Article, recognition and
enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where
recognition and enforcement is sought finds that the recognition or enforcement of the award would
be contrary to the public policy of that country.

In accordance with Article 478 of the Civil Procedure Code of Ukraine the court shall refuse to
recognise and enforce an international arbitral award if: 1) at the request of the party against whom
the award was issued, if [sic] that party furnishes to the court proof that: a) one of the parties to the
arbitration agreement was under some incapacity; or such agreement is not valid under the law to
which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country
where the award was made; or b) the party against whom the award was made was not given proper
notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was, for other valid
reasons, unable to present its position; or c) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by the
arbitration agreement or a dispute not falling within its terms, or contains decisions on matters outside
the scope of the arbitration agreement; provided that, if the decisions on matters covered by the
arbitration agreement can be separated from those not covered by the agreement, that part of the
award which contains decisions on matters covered by the arbitration agreement may be recognised
and enforced; or d) the composition of the international commercial arbitral tribunal or the arbitral
procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, absent such agreement, was not
in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or e) the award has not yet
become binding on the parties, or has been set aside, or its execution has been suspended by a court of
the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made; or 2) if the court finds that: a)
the law provides that the dispute may not be referred to international commercial arbitration in view
of its subject matter; or b) the recognition and enforcement of such award would be contrary to the
public order of Ukraine.

Specifically, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, which represents the State of Ukraine in the dispute,
objected to the application of VEB.RF State Development Corporation, alleging grounds for it as laid
down in Article 478 of the Civil Procedure Code of Ukraine.

Specifically, as a ground to refuse the application, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine indicated that the
Emergency Arbitrator award was made in a dispute that does not fall within the terms of the
arbitration agreement (lack of jurisdiction of the Emergency Arbitrator).

In examining these arguments, the Court notes the following.

The arbitration agreement in investor-State arbitration proceedings consists of:

- the provisions of a bilateral or multilateral international agreement on the promotion and mutual
protection of foreign investment, the terms of which contain a public offer of a contracting (host)

State addressed to an indefinite number of foreign investors of another contracting State to submit to
an arbitral tribunal disputes arising out of the provisions of such international agreement between the
(host) Contracting State and an investor of another Contracting State concerning the protection of its

investments in the territory of the host State: - the acceptance of that offer by an investor of the other
Contracting State, which crystallises in the request for arbitration submitted to the arbitral tribunal.

According to this rule, the offer of the State of Ukraine to submit the dispute with an investor of the
Russian Federation concerning its investments in Ukraine is limited by the conditions set out in the
Agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Government of the Russian Federation on
encouragement and mutual protection of investments of 12 December 1999 ratified by the Law of Ukraine
No 1302-XIV of 15 December 1999 (hereinafter - the BIT).

By ratifying the BIT, the State of Ukraine agreed to resolve disputes with Russian investors under the
Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (hereinafter - the
Arbitration Rules).

The version of the Arbitration Rules, in force at the time when the BIT was concluded (Arbitration
Rules 1999) did not provide for a procedure for appointing an emergency arbitrator. By contrast, the
procedure for appointing an emergency arbitrator was only provided in the 2010 version of the
Arbitration Rules, i.e., 10 years after Ukraine gave its consent to resolve disputes in accordance with
the said Arbitration Rules.

Since 1999, the State of Ukraine has agreed to apply the Arbitration Rules in only four instances of
concluding bilateral and multilateral agreements on the promotion and mutual protection of foreign
investments, namely: the Agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the
Government of the Russian Federation on encouragement and mutual protection of investments of
1999 December, ratified by Law of Ukraine No 1302-XIV of 15 December 1999; the Agreement
between the Government of Ukraine and the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union on mutual
promotion and protection of investments ratified by Law of Ukraine No 118/97-VR of 26 February
1997; the Agreement between the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the People’s
Republic of China on the promotion and mutual protection of investments, entered into force on 30
May 1993; The Energy Charter Treaty and Final Act, ratified by Law of Ukraine No 89/98-VR
(89/98-VR) of 6 February 1998.

Ukraine did not, however, agree to the application of the 2017 version of the Arbitration Rules in
disputes to which it is party.

Thus, the emergency arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to rule against the State of Ukraine in this case.

Therefore, the court agrees with the arguments of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine that the
Emergency Arbitrator award was made in a dispute that does not fall within the terms of the
arbitration agreement (lack of jurisdiction of the Emergency Arbitrator).

In addition, the norms of international legal acts must be applied in the versions in force at the time of
their ratification and recognition by Ukraine.

However, the emergency arbitration procedure and appointment of the emergency arbitrator was
governed by the 2017 Arbitration Rules, even though Law of Ukraine No 1302-XIV On the
ratification of the Agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Government of the

Russian Federation on encouragement and mutual protection of investments was adopted on 15
December 1999.

As another ground to refuse the application, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine pointed out that the
State of Ukraine (against which the decision was made) was, for good reasons, unable to provide its
comments (violation of due process). The court considers that in the course of the review of the
application for the recognition and enforcement of the Emergency Arbitrator Award, such arguments
have been confirmed for the following reasons.

It follows from the Emergency Arbitrator award that the claimant applied for an Emergency
Arbitrator appointment on 21 August 2019. On the same day, the SCC Secretariat confirmed in
writing to the applicant the receipt of the application and the payment of the costs of the Emergency
Arbitrator Proceedings. The SCC Secretariat informed the Respondent that it had received the
Application. Both Parties were informed that the SCC Board would endeavour to appoint an
Emergency Arbitrator within 24 hours. By letter dated 22 August 2019, received by e-mail at 09:23
(London time), the SCC Board appointed Joe Tirado as Emergency Arbitrator in the above-mentioned
emergency proceedings.

The above shows that the emergency arbitrator received the application on Thursday, 22 August
2019; pursuant to the Arbitration Rules, the award was thus to be issued within five days, by 27
August 2019.

In accordance with due legal process, the State of Ukraine is entitled to provide its comments
concerning the issue brought for decision before the Emergency Arbitrator.

However, Saturday 24 August 2019 fell on a national holiday in Ukraine (Independence Day). As a
result, Monday 26 August 2019 was a non-working day.

Thus, of the five days that the State had available to prepare its legal position, three fell on non-
working days in Ukraine.

In view of the above, the court concludes that the State of Ukraine was deprived of the opportunity to
state its detailed position in the case for reasons that in no way depended on it and could not be
eliminated by it.

Furthermore, when considering the application for the recognition and enforcement of the Emergency
Arbitrator award, the court established that the recognition and enforcement of such award would be
contrary to the public order (public policy) of Ukraine.

According to the explanations set out in paragraph 12 of Resolution No 12 of the Plenum of the
Supreme Court of Ukraine of 24 December 1999 On judicial practice with respect to applications for
recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral and judicial decisions and annulment of decisions
rendered by way of international commercial arbitration in the territory of Ukraine, “public order”
means the legal order of a State, and the defining principles and foundations which form the basis of
the system that exists in the State (in particular, concerning its independence, integrity, sovereignty
and inviolability, basic constitutional rights, freedoms, guarantees, etc.).

Furthermore, in accordance with Article 12 of the Law of Ukraine On Private International Law, a rule of

(BE TRANSLATION

law of a foreign State shall not be applied when its application leads to consequences that are manifestly
incompatible with the foundations of the legal order (public policy) of Ukraine.

In defining the content of this concept, account should be taken of the recommendations of the
International Law Association on Public Policy adopted in 2002 in New Delhi, which states that the
finality of awards rendered in the context of international commercial arbitration should be respected save
in exceptional circumstances

Such exceptional circumstances may in particular be found to exist if recognition or enforcement of the
international arbitral award would contravene international public policy. According to paragraph 1(d) of
these recommendations, international public policy of any State includes: (i) fundamental principles,
pertaining to justice or morality that the State wishes to protect even when it is not directly concerned (ii)
tules designed to serve the essential political, social or economic interests of the State, these being known
as “lois de police” or “public policy rules” and (iii) the duty of the State to respect its obligations towards
other States or international organisations.

Public order will be violated if the recognition and enforcement of a decision of a foreign arbitral tribunal
in a specific case conflicts with national norms to an extent that would be unacceptable under the national
principles of the legal order.

The Emergency Arbitrator Award, which orders the state to suspend enforcement actions in enforcement
proceedings under enforcement order No 796/165/2018 issued on 19 February 2019 by the Kyiv Court of
Appeal concerning the execution of the award of the Arbitral Tribunal (The Hague, Kingdom of the
Netherlands) dated 2 May 2018 in PCA Case No 2015-36 concerning the claim of Everest Estate LLC and
others contradicts the public order of Ukraine.

Netherlands) of 2 May 2018 in PCA case No 2015-36 concerning the recovery from the debtor — the

for the relevant immovable property established that the respondent had unlawfully expropriated the
claimants’ property contrary to Article 5 of the Agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine
and the Government of the Russian Federation on the promotion and mutual protection of investments of
27 November 1998. According to para b) of the Award, the Claimants were awarded as compensation for

PERSON_1 for the recognition and enforcement of the award of the Arbitral Tribunal (The Hague,
Kingdom of the Netherlands) of 2 May 2018 in PCA case No 2015-36.

 

There was issued an enforcement order for the execution of the award of the Arbitral Tribunal (The
Hague, Kingdom of the Netherlands) of 2 May 2018 in PCA case No 2015-36 concerning the claim
of Everest Estate LLC, Edelweiss-2000 PE, Fortuna PJSC, UBK-Invest PJSC, Niva-Tour LLC, Imme
LLC, Planeta PE, Krim Development LLC, Aerobud PJSC, Privatoffice LLC, Dayris LLC, Diline Ltd
LLC, Zhisa TV and Radio Company Limited Liability Company, Privatland LLC, Dan-Panorama
LLC with Foreign Investment Share, Sanatorium Energetic LLC, Asset Management Company
FINANCIAL CAPITAL LLC, Asset Management Company FINANCIAL VECTOR LLC, and
PERSON _| against the Russian Federation (in the person of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian
Federation) for damages in compensation for the relevant immovable property.

Enforcement orders were issued to collect from the Russian Federation (in the person of the Ministry
of Finance of the Russian Federation) in favour of the claimants the following amounts in accordance
with the award of the Arbitral Tribunal (The Hague, Kingdom of the Netherlands) of 2 May 2018 in
PCA case No 2015-36.

The Russian Federation (in the person of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation) was ordered to
pay to each claimant UAH 881.00 in court fees.

By judgment of 25 January 2019, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Kyiv Court of Appeal
of 25 September 2018.

The decision of the Supreme Court is final and not subject to appeal.

Consequently, the recognition and enforcement of the Emergency Arbitrator award would jeopardise
the rule of law and legal certainty by preventing the State from implementing the execution of the
arbitral award of the Arbitral Tribunal (The Hague, Kingdom of the Netherlands) of 2 May 05 in PCA case
No 2018-2015 concerning the claim of Everest Estate LLC and others against the Russian Federation in
accordance with the obligations imposed on the State under the New York Convention.

At the same time, the binding force of a court decision was enshrined in the Constitution of Ukraine,
specifically in Article 129, which stipulates that the binding nature of a court decision constitutes one of
the principles of judicial proceedings.

In view of the above, the recognition and enforcement of the Arbitral Award is contrary to the public
policy of the State of Ukraine, and these circumstances constitute grounds provided in Article V of the
New York Convention to refuse the application.

Pursuant to subparagraph Article 478(1)(2)(b) of the Civil Procedure Code of Ukraine, the application for
enforcement of an international commercial arbitration decision may be refused if the enforcement of the
decision is contrary to the public order of Ukraine.

In summary, the court concludes that there are grounds as provided in Article 478 of the Civil Procedure
Code of Ukraine to refuse the application of VEB.RF State Development Corporation for the recognition
and enforcement of the award of the Emergency Arbitrator of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm
Chamber of Commerce dated 28 August 2019 in Case No 2019/113.
