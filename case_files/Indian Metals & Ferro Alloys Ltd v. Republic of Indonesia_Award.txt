The Dispute

A dispute has arisen between the Claimant and the Respondent concerning a mining licence
issued by the East Barito Regency in respect of which the Claimant filed a Notice of
Arbitration on 24 July 2015 pursuant to Article 9(b) of the Agreement between the
Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government of the Republic of India for
the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 8 February 1999 (the “Treaty” or
“BIT”).

In accordance with Article 9(b) of the Treaty, these proceedings were conducted under the
1976 Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(“UNCITRAL Rules”).

Procedural History

The procedural history is a matter of record. The main procedural events are contained in
Appendix | to this Award which should be read with, and form part of, this Award.

Shortly after the President was appointed, he requested that the Parties set out their
positions in a three-page document including any jurisdictional arguments. At this stage,
the Respondent had not instructed external counsel and was represented by members of
the Attorney General’s chambers. The Respondent also requested to bifurcate the
proceedings; a request to which the Claimant objected. The Tribunal decided to reject the
Respondent’s request.

Page 8

AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

The Parties served detailed submissions in multiple rounds. There were substantial issues
relating to disclosure of documents. The Tribunal benefitted from an early opening at the
Peace Palace in The Hague which helped to clarify some issues. At this stage, the
Respondent was represented by Simmons & Simmons and the temporal jurisdiction
elaborated in the early opening was an additional argument to that which was raised in
the three-page document and request for bifurcation submitted by the Attorney General’s
chambers.

The main hearing was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague from 6 to 10 and 14 August
2018, with the following persons in attendance:

Factual Background of the Dispute

The Claimant invested in PT SRI (“SRI”), a local Indonesian company, for the purpose
of coal mining production. At the time of the Claimant’s alleged investment, SRI held a
production licence, Production IUP No 569 of 2009 (“SRI Mining Concession”), which
was issued to SRI by the Regent of East Barito in the province of Central Kalimantan on
the island of Borneo,

The dispute in this arbitration mainly revolves around overlapping licences that were
issued by the Respondent to other companies. The overlapping licences rendered SRI
Mining Concession useless.

The paragraphs below provide the general factual background of the dispute in more
detail. To the extent deemed appropriate, the Tribunal will address additional relevant
facts in its decision in the following sections of the Award.

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

The Process of Decentralisation in Indonesia

18.

20.

21.

22.

Indonesia is a very large country consisting of 13000 islands. It has a land mass total of
735,000 square miles and a population in excess of 261,000,000 making it the 4th most
populous country in the world. It comprises 300 ethnic groups and its people speak a total
of 700 languages or dialects.

Until 1998, Indonesia had a highly centralised political system. Following the
resignation of President Suharto in 1998, Indonesia started a process of decentralisation
of authority.

Accordingly, Law No 22 of 1999 transferred most authority and funding from the
central government to regencies and municipalities rather than the provincial
governments,!

As explained by the Respondent:

“Law No 22 of 1999 is a framework law that left many issues for determination in
the more detailed regulations that followed. It took some time for these regulations
to be drafted and implemented by the central government, while at the regional
level regional governments implemented regional regulations for matters that had
yet to be regulate centrally. The law has since been amended a number of times,
most recently in 2014.”

The Republic of Indonesia has various levels of government. The following levels are
noted: (i) Central Government — the President of the Republic of Indonesia holds
governmental authority of the State of the Republic of Indonesia; (ii) The Provinces are
headed by Governors. They are further divided into regencies and municipalities; (iii)
Regencies are headed by Regents and further divided into districts, villages and special
areas and urban areas.

The Territory in which the Investment was Made

23.

The island of Borneo is divided between three countries: Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.
Kalimantan is the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo and covers approximately 73%
of the island’s land mass, Within Kalimantan, there are currently five provinces: South
Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and North
Kalimantan (only created in 2012). Central Kalimantan is divided into one municipality

See Exhibit CL-6, Law No 22 of 1999 promulgated on 07 May 1999 by the Republic of Indonesia
concerning regional administrations dated 7 May 1999,

Respondent’s Statement of Defence (“SOD”), para. 5.3. See also Exhibit CL-5, Law No 32 of 2004
concerning regional administration dated 15 October 2004.

and thirteen regencies, including East Barito Regency (in Indonesian language, Barito
Timur), which is the regency that granted the mining licences to SRI, and South Barito
Regency. South Kalimantan Province includes the Tabalong Regency.

SRI’s operation in Indonesia

24,

25.

26.

27.

28.

SRI was incorporated as a limited liability company, under the laws of Indonesia, on
12 June 2003.4

SRI was granted coal exploration licence, through Exploration KP No 185 of 2006 dated
16 June 2006, by the Regent of East Barito, in respect of a land area of 5000 hectares, for
a period of 2 years (from 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2008).°

On 28 March 2008, SRI renewed its coal exploration licence through Exploration KP
No 135 of 2008 issued by the Regent of East Barito. The licence was limited to 4000
hectares and valid for one year until 27 March 2009.° Condition 8 of the licence
stipulated as follows:
“Given the unclear boundaries based on the spatial layout, i.e. the boundaries with
the Barito Selatan Regency of Central Kalimantan Province, and the boundaries with
the Tabalong Regency of South Kalimantan Province, in conducting Exploration,
there should be coordination with Barito Selatan Regency, Central Kalimantan
Province, and Tabalong Regency, South Kalimantan Province. In the event that in
such coordination, it turns out that there is an area falling into the area of Barito
Selatan Regency of Central Kalimantan Province and Tabalong Regency of South
Kalimantan Province, then the holder of Mining Rights shall remove its area falling
into another area.”’

On 10 November 2008, SRI applied to upgrade its Exploration KP No 135 of 2008 to an
Exploitation KP.’

In addition, the Claimant argues that it applied for renewal of Exploration KP No 135 of
2008 on 22 December 2008. The Claimant relies on Exploration IUP No 463 of 2009,

12 June 2003.

which refers to an application dated 22 December 2008.’ The Respondent submits that
“it is improbable that such an application was made on that date given that SRI applied
for an upgrade of its Exploration KP on 10 November 2008 and the correspondence from
the Regent on 11 April 2009.”'°

On 28 March 2009, Exploration KP No 135 of 2008 expired.

On 11 April 2009, the East Barito Regent wrote to the Director of SRI in relation to SRI’s
application of 10 November 2018. East Barito Regent indicated that SRI’s application for
an Exploitation KP could not be considered given that SRI had failed to provide
supporting documents, including a “/cJoordination result report on the activities
conducted on the border of the Regency of East Barito and the Regency of Tabalong.”"'
The Respondent submits that this reference to the coordination report is “a direct
reference to condition 8 of Exploration KP No 135 of 2008.”'? In any case, the Claimant
emphasises that condition 8 of Exploration KP No 135 of 2008 was not included in the
succeeding SRI’s licences."

On 17 October 2009, the Regent of East Barito issued Exploration [UP No 463 of 2009 to
SRI, over the same area of 4,000 hectares identical to that covered by Exploration KP No
135 of 2008. The licence was with effect from 16 June 2009 and valid until 16 June 2012."

On 8 December 2009, the Regent of East Barito issued an amended Exploration [UP No
526 of 2009 to SRI in respect ofa land area of 3,674 hectares.'> The licence was valid for
a period of 7 years, from 16 June 2009 to 15 June 2016.

On 31 December 2009, the Regent of East Barito issued Production IUP No 569 of 2009
to SRI (i.e. SRI Mining Concession), over the same area of 3,674 hectares, for a period

The Claimant’s Investment

39,

The Claimant entered into a Term Sheet dated 18 September 2009 to acquire a 70%
majority equity stake and interests in SRI, for US$ 8.75 million.!

On 23 October 2009, the Claimant’s Board of Directors decided to invest in coal block in
Indonesia, including through a wholly owned investment subsidiary.'®

On 7 June 2010, Indmet Mining Pte Limited Singapore (“Indmet”), a subsidiary of
Indmet (Mauritius) Ltd, which was the Claimant’s subsidiary, entered into a Share
Purchase Agreement, for acquiring a 70% interest in SRI?

The acquisition of 70% of the shares in SRI was completed when the transfer deeds were
executed in favour of Indmet on 27 October 2010.” The final and full payment for the
shares was made on 4 November 2010.7!

It should be stated that according to the Claimant, at the time of the Share Purchase
Agreement dated 7 June 2010 and the acquisition of 70% of the shares in SRI, Indmet
was wholly owned by Indmet (Mauritius) Ltd, which was incorporated in Mauritius and
wholly owned and controlled by the Claimant. Indmet (Mauritius) was voluntarily
dissolved on 30 April 2013.

SRI’s Approval as a Foreign Investment Limited Liability Company

40. In Indonesia, the relevant law concerning foreign investments is the Capital Investment
Law No 25 of 2007 (“CIL” or “2007 Investment Law”).””

41. In accordance with the CIL, the Capital Investment Coordinating Board of Indonesia
(“BKPM”) supervises and administers all foreign investments in Indonesia except

2 Exhibit RL-7/CL-2, Capital Investment Law No 25 of 2007.

Page 16

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

investments in banks, financial institutions, upstream oil and gas or the ownership of
shares in publicly listed companies purchased from the Indonesian stock market.??

42. Under Article 5(2) of the CIL, “foreign capital investment is obliged to be in a form of a
limited liability company pursuant to Indonesian law and is domiciled in the territory of

the Republic of Indonesia, unless stipulated otherwise by a law.”**

43. An Indonesian limited liability company with foreign ownership, as approved by BKPM,
is known as a foreign investment company, penanaman modal asing (“PMA
company”).”>

44, On 15 February 2010, SRI requested the Regent of East Barito Regency to recommend
the status change of SRI into a PMA company. This recommendation was accorded to
SRI by the Regent of East Barito Regency on 21 April 2010.76

45. On 5 August 2010, SRI applied to the BKPM for approval of the conversion of the
company’s status into a PMA company.?”

46. Following SRI’s application, BKPM granted approval (Capital Investment Principle
Permit) dated 10 August 2010, for amendment of SRI’s company status into PMA
company to allow foreign investment into SRI.’* The Capital Investment Principle Permit
records that Indmet Mining will hold 70% of the share capital of SRI.

47. As we shall see below, whether the Claimant’s investment in SRI was approved by BKPM
is another important element which is disputed by the Parties.

Overlapping Licences

48. According to the Claimant, it discovered that SRI Mining Concession overlaps with other
licences in April 2011, when its officials attended a meeting at the Forestry Office at East
Barito Regency as part of application process of commencing mining activities.?°

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

On 12 July 2011, the Claimant approached the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
(“MEMR”) and obtained a mining concession information map, which showed that the
major part of the SRI Mining Concession fell outside the Regency of East Barito and
outside the Central Kalimantan Province.*° The map also showed that the SRI Mining
Concession overlaps with mining concessions issued to six companies:

(i) PT Putra Bara Utama (“PT PBU”) (86.90 ha);

(ii) PT Puspita Alam Kurnia (“PT PAK”) (736.6 ha);

(iii) PT Tanjung Bartim Kurnia (“PT TBK”) (1,149.23 ha);
(iv) PT Geo Explo (41.61 ha);

(v) PT Kodio Multicom (1,109.02 ha);

(vi) PT Marangkayu Bara Makarti (“PT MBM”) (880.8 ha).

On 22 October 2013 Claimant, on application to the Director General of Mineral and

Coal, received another mining concession information map,*! which showed seven

overlapping mining concession holders in addition to SRI:
(i) PT PBU (86.99 ha);
(ii) PT PAK (754.85 ha);
(iii) PT TBK (1,150.25 ha);
(iv) PT Geo Explo (41.61 ha);
(v) PT Kodio Multicom (1,109.01 ha);
(vi) PT MBM (899.05 ha);
(vii) PT Bintang Awai Bersinar (“PT BAB”) (87.16 ha)

As we shall see below, the Respondent argues that the Claimant should have been aware
of the overlapping licences before it made its investment.

In any case, although the Parties disagree on the exact dates and detail of the overlapping
licences, it seems clear that by 31 December 2009, SRI Mining Concession was over an

Indonesia’s Attempt to Solve the Overlapping Licences and the Clean and Clear List

54,

55.

56.

According to the Respondent, by 2011, overlapping licences became a common and well
known problem in Indonesia:

“Regents were regularly criticised in public and the press for failing to follow the
correct procedures to ensure that licences did not overlap, not having the
experience to administer mining licensing and not complying with the requirements
for issuing licences.

To resolve overlapping issues, the company who had the licence could take
administrative law action against the regent who issued the licence. [...]

In May 2011, MEMR implemented a national reconciliation of data on IUPs {i.e. a
mining business permits]. Governors, regents and mayors from across Indonesia
were asked to submit data on the IUPs so that MEMR could reconcile the data and
create a national mineral and coal mining data base. The purpose of undertaking
the reconciliation was to coordinate, verify and synchronize IUPs in all provinces,
regencies and municipalities in Indonesia. Through the reconciliation process
MEMR is establishing a national IUP information system, determining the national
mining area and potential for development of Indonesia's resources.”

In May 2011, the MEMR announced that based on the data collected, out of 8,475 mining
business permits (“IUP”), which were issued pursuant to Law No 4 of 2009 concerning
mineral and coal mining, 3,971 IUPs were Clean Clear and 4,504 were not Clean and
Clear.

On 30 June 2011, the MEMR issued the first Clean and Clear lists on its website and
announced the criteria of the Clean and Clear process.*° For a licence to be included as
Clean and Clear it had to have no overlapping licences and be issued before | May 2010.°°
In this regard, the Respondent explains as follows:

“TAccording to the announcement of 30 June 2011] ifan IUP is not included in the
Clean and Clear list, the holder of the IUP should write to the issuer of the IUP in

response, copying the Director General of Minerals and Coal, if the holder would
like to have the status of its IUP reconsidered.

MEMR has held a number of reconciliation rounds since in which the governors
and regents have submitted data on the IUPs issued in their province / regency and
this data has been reconciled. Companies were also able to submit documents to
the issuer of the IUP and MEMR in order to resolve the problems with their IUPs
(for example if the records held by the issuer of the IUP were incomplete). Some
companies voluntarily relinquished areas of their IUPs in order to resolve
overlapping issues. Once the IUP is assessed to be Clean and Clear this is shown
on the MEMR’s website.

After MEMR has declared an IUP to be Clean and Clear, the IUP holder can then
apply for a Clean and Clear Certificate, which is required in order to obtain other
licences such as the Borrow Use Permit and to export coal.”*”

Furthermore, the Respondent elaborates as follows:

“The MEMR has made other public statements, including many industry
presentations, about the process for compiling the Clean and Clear lists and the
criteria for assessing Clean and Clear status. [...] MEMR has published the criteria
for inclusion on the Clean and Clear list and the process it follows on its website
as well as discussing these issues with the industry.”

The SRI Mining Concession has not been in any of the Clean and Clear lists published
by the MEMR. As we shall see below, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s failure
to reconcile SRI Mining Concession with the overlapping mining concessions through
the process of the Clean and Clear lists is another violation of the Treaty. In addition, the
Claimant argues that “the Respondent did not inform the Claimant about the process
being followed for issuance of the Clean and Clear list, and the reason for non-inclusion
of SRI’s Production IUP from the Clean and Clear list.”

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

In January 2009, the Respondent enacted a new mining law on coal and mineral mining
— Law No. 4 of 2009. According to the new mining law, foreign shareholders of
companies holding IUPs would need to divest their shares after five years of production.
However, the law did not set out the percentage of shares that would be required to be
divested. This was left to the implementing regulations.°!

Government Regulation No 23 of 2010, with legal effect from 1 February 2010,
introduced a divestiture requirement that PMA companies that hold an IUP must, upon 5
years of production, divest 20% of their shares to Indonesian participants.

Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 (“Government Regulation No 24 of 2012”),
which amended Government Regulation No 23 of 2010, required that the foreign
shareholdings in a PMA company be reduced on a sliding scale after 5 years of actual
production.® As explained by the Respondent:

“Pursuant to Government Regulation No 24 of 2012, Indonesian entities should
hold shareholdings in the PMA company which holds the Production IUP as

follows:
Period of actual production Proportion of shares to be
held by Indonesian entities

0-5 years Nil

If shares are required to be divested, the shares should be offered to Indonesian
entities in the following order:

(A) The central government, the provincial government and then the regency /
municipality where the mining operations are located;

(B) State owned and regional government owned enterprises; and
(©) Wholly Indonesian owned private companies.

Further regulations this year have clarified that the share pricing is to be
determined by fair market value.”**

As further explained below, the Claimant argues that by introducing Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012 to increase the divestment requirement for foreign shareholding
from 20% to 51%, the Respondent has breached the BIT by inter alia violating the fair
and equitable standard and expropriating the Claimant’s investment.

(E) Grant any other relief to the Respondent that it deems fit.””

Jurisdiction
The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction for the following reasons:

(1) The alleged conduct of the Respondent which allegedly constitutes a breach of
the BIT occurred before the Claimant became an investor and made its investment under
the Treaty (“the Temporal Objection”);

(I) The Claimant’s investment has not been “established or acquired’ in
accordance with Indonesian law pursuant to Article 1(1) of the BIT (“the Legality
Objection”);

(IID The Claimant’s investment has not been “accepted as such in accordance with
[Indonesia’s] Jaws and regulations in force concerning foreign investments” within the
meaning of Article 2 of the BIT (“the No Acceptance Objection”);

(IV) The Claimant’s purported investment was an indirect investment, which is not
protected by the Treaty (“the Indirect Investment Objection”);

At the outset, it is important to note that the Tribunal has had the benefit of extensive
written and oral submissions from the Parties. The Tribunal sees no need to summarise
each and every submission made by the Parties in the following sections of the Award.
For the avoidance of doubt, all submissions of the Parties have been carefully considered
by the Tribunal in reaching its decision.

The Temporal Objection

In essence, the Temporal Objection is based on the allegation that the matters complained
by the Claimant occurred prior to the Claimant’s alleged investment. According to the
Parties, there are various provisions that are relevant to the Temporal Objection.

First, Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “WCLT”)
stipulates as follows:
“Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its
provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any

situation which ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of the treaty with
respect to that party.”

Second, Article 13 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on the Responsibility
of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts provides that: “An act of a State does not
constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the
obligation in question at the time the act occurs.”

Third, Article 2 of the Treaty provides as follows:

“This Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of either
Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, accepted as such
in accordance with its laws and regulations in force concerning foreign
investments, whether made before or after the coming into force of this Agreement.”

Fourth, Article 9 of the Treaty elaborates as follows:

“1, Any dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the
Sormer, be settled amicably through consultations and negotiations.

2. If such a dispute cannot be settled within a period of six months from the date of
written notification of the dispute, the dispute shall, at the option of the investor
concerned, be submitted either to the competent judicial, arbitral or administrative
bodies of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment for settlement
in accordance with its laws and the provisions of this Agreement, or to international
arbitration or conciliation. The option so exercised under this paragraph shall be

final.
Leal’
Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that much of the Claimant’s claim is outside the scope of the
Treaty’s protection because the conduct of which the Claimant complains took place
before the Claimant made its purported investment in SRI. Thus, a very substantial part
of the Claimant’s claim falls outside of the temporal scope of the Respondent’s consent
to arbitration, as expressed in Article 9 of the Treaty, and the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”

According to the Respondent, the rule against the retroactive application of treaties, as
enshrined in Article 28 of the VCLT must be the starting point for the Tribunal’s
consideration as to whether the Claimant’s claims are within the temporal scope of
protection of the Treaty.”

79,

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

In relation to the rule against the retroactive application of treaties, the Respondent
submits as follows:

“[...] in the context of a claim under the BIT, what is critical for the purposes of the
Tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction is the date on which the putative claimant acquires
an investment that falls within the scope of protection of the BIT (assuming that the
BIT has already entered into force). It is only after that point that the BIT will apply
to regulate the conduct of the host State with respect to that investment, such that
the host State’s adoption of measures (i.e., any “act or fact”) may lead to such
conduct giving rise to the host State’s responsibility for an internationally wrongful
act (i.e., the breach of treaty obligations). That is the general position. Article 28
of the VCLT envisages that some treaties may contain a “different intention” or
that such may be “otherwise established”. But this is not so in the case of the
Indonesia — India BIT.”"4

According to the Respondent, the only provision in the Treaty that touches on the
temporal application of the Treaty is Article 2, which confirms “that it does not matter
whether a putative claimant made its investment in the territory of the host State before
or after the entry into force of the BIT — the putative claimant’s investment will be within
the BIT’s scope of protection.””> However, Article 2 does not affect the general position
as expressed in Article 28 of the VCLT.”©

Accordingly, the Respondent submits that a putative claimant must demonstrate that it
was, for the purposes of the BIT, an “investor” with a protected “investment” at the time
of the host State’s alleged breach of its BIT obligation(s).”’ This conclusion is also
consistent with Article 13 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on the
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.’

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

Turning to the timing of the Claimant’s purported investment and the timing of the
Respondent’s conduct which allegedly constitutes a breach of the Treaty, the Respondent
makes the following submissions.

First, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that it made an investment in 2010
by entering into a SPA dated 7 June 2010” or on 10 August 2010 when BKPM granted
permission to SRI to become a PMA Company,” or on 27 October 2017 (when the Share
Transfer Deeds and the Subscription for New Shares Agreement were executed).'! As
explained below in more detail, the Respondent argues that the earliest that Indmet became
a shareholder in SRI and the Claimant became an indirect shareholder in SRI was 12 May
2011.** According to the Respondent, “[i]t is settled in investment arbitration that the date
of investment is the date on which the shares vested in the investor.”"® Accordingly, putting
aside the Respondent’s other preliminary objections, the Respondent submits that the
Claimant’s shares in SRI did not constitute an “investment” and the Claimant was not an
“investor” within the meaning of the Treaty prior to 12 May 2011.

Second, the Respondent submits that the alleged Treaty breach, namely the issuing of
overlapping licences and boundary issues, all predated 12 May 2011 when the
Claimant allegedly became an “investor”. They also pre-date the Claimant’s alleged
investment dates.*4

Third, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the “critical date” for the
Tribunal’s consideration of the temporal issue is the date of publication of the impugned
measure and/or the date on which the Claimant “became aware” of the alleged treaty
breaches.*> According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to cite any authority

is expressed in article 28 of the Vienna Convention on th law of treaties, and is present also in the
International Law Commission's Articles on State responsibil

which supports its argument. Contrary to the Claimant’s submission, the Gremcitel and
Philip Morris awards do not support the Claimant’s argument. *° These awards
unanimously point to the time that the alleged breach occurred as the “critical date”.®”

In this respect, the Respondent also argues that “it is disingenuous for the Claimant to
assert that it knew nothing of the overlapping licences and boundary issues in April
2011.”88 According to the Respondent, “the Claimant knew or ought to have known about
these issues long before this.”*®°

Fourth, the Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s arguments regarding the conduct that
occurred after 12 May 2011 that arguably resulted in a breach of the Treaty,°° In
particular, the Respondent refers to the following events that according to the Claimant
resulted in independent “treaty breaches”: (a) the publication by the MEMR of its national
reconciliation of data on IUPs (which took place in May 2011); (b) the MEMR’s
publication of the first “Clean and Clear Lists” on 30 June 2011; (c) the publication by
the Respondent of various maps in 2011— 2014; (d) the alleged issue of overlapping
licences of PT Kodio Multicom and PT MBM in 2014 and PT PBU in 2016. In this regard,
the Respondent makes the following submission:

“(A) The MEMR’s ‘national reconciliation of data on IUPs’ of May 2011 merely
consisted of the collation of existing data, rather than the adoption of any new
measures (such as the issue of licences) by the Respondent. This process identified
what licences already overlapped and whether there were other problems with
existing licences, such as boundary issues.

(B) The MEMR’s publication of ‘Clean and Clear Lists’ on 30 June 2011 (which
naturally followed the “national reconciliation” which was completed in May
2011) also merely consisted of the collation of existing data, rather than the
adoption of any new measures.

AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

(©) As for the publication by the Respondent of various maps, it is not the maps that
undermine the validity of the Production IUP, but rather the issue of inconsistent
licences and the boundary issues, As the Respondent's expert, Mr Beckmann,
explains, the existence of inconsistent maps is one of the reasons why it is necessary
to collect maps from multiple agencies as part of any due diligence.

In light of the nature of these events, it simply cannot be said that the publication of
these documents, such as the ‘Clean and Clear List’ in June 2011 can be
characterised as an ‘egregious omission and inaction’, or as a ‘subsequent and
independent measure’ which could be a breach of the BIT. This is because the
publication of the ‘national reconciliation’ of IUPs, the publication of the ‘Clean and
Clear Lists’, and the publication of the maps merely represented ex post facto the
situation that existed prior to those dates ~ a situation which had been brought about
by the unresolved boundary issues and the issue of overlapping mining licences.

[...] [Regarding the alleged issue of overlapping licences of PT Kodio Multicom
and PT MBM in 2014] [...] the exploration licences were originally issued to PT
Kodio Multicom and PT MBM on 23 May 2008. The fact that these exploration
licences were upgraded to Production IUPs on 11 March 2014 did not create any
additional overlapping areas, which remained the same. This therefore merely
continued the position that had existed since 23 May 2008.”*!

Concerning the Production [UP that was issued to PT PBU on 13 October 2016 by the
Governor of South Kalimantan, the Respondent submits that the Production IUP covers a
reduced area of 3,930 hectares which no longer overlaps with SRI Mining Concession.”

Finally, the Respondent argues at length about the temporal nature of its Treaty
obligation. Among other things, it states as follows:

“[...] the Claimant appears to assert that, irrespective of the date of the alleged
breaches of the BIT, the Resp heless has a to
resolve the boundary issues and overlapping licences. Thus, it argues that the
Respondent's ‘constitutional authorities’ were ‘by the rule of law standard, obliged to

reconcile disparate boundaries and inconsistent permits issued by constitutional
functionaries’.

bel

Nowhere does the Claimant point to the source of this obligation, other than to
vague ‘constitutional obligations’ or ‘declarations in the BIT’. But to the extent that
the Claimant is suggesting that the Respondent is in breach of a ‘continuing
obligation’ which therefore post-dates its asserted investment, the Claimant is
mistaken. This is highly artificial and, if accepted, would be tantamount to
suggesting that every breach of an international obligation is a continuing
obligation so long as the State which is responsible for the internationally wrongful
act has not made reparation.

There is an important distinction between an act which has a continuing character,
and an act which is already completed, but which continues to cause loss or
damage. This is reflected in Article 14(1) of the International Law Commission’s
Articles on State Responsibility, which states that {t]he breach of an international
obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing character occurs at the
moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.” In accordance with
this provision, an act does not have a continuing character merely because its
effects or consequences extend in time. It must be the wrongful act as such which
continues. The effects or consequences which extend in time are the subject of the
responsible State’s secondary obligation to make reparation in respect of its
internationally wrongful act. But the extension of such effects or consequences do
not mean that the breach itself is a continuing one. [...]

In any event, the concept of a ‘continuing breach’ is irrelevant in the present case.
As [Professor Douglas QC] notes, where ‘the tribunal’s adjudicative power is
conferred by the same international instrument that creates the substantive primary
obligation, as is the case with an investment treaty claim, then the concept of a
continuing wrongful act serves little purpose.’ Nor can the Claimant argue (if it
were minded so to do) that the Respondent’s conduct constitutes a ‘composite
breach’, if the first act in the series of acts occurs before the entry into force of the
Respondent's obligations with respect to a particular investment.

 

In the present case, the conduct of which the Claimant complains occurred prior
to the point in time at which it (allegedly) established or acquired its purported
investment under the BIT (whether that took place on 10 August 2010, on 29 April
2011, or on 12 May 2011). The Respondent’s conduct of which the Claimant
complains consists of the issuance of overlapping licences and the boundary
issues. Those are acts which were completed, even though their effects and
consequences continued to be felt after the Claimant’s alleged acquisition of its
purported investment. [...]”?

According to the Respondent, the only conduct of the Respondent that is within the
Tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction is the adoption of Government Regulation No 24 of
2012, which requires that foreign companies which own shares in Indonesian companies
reduce their shareholding to 49%." However, as explained below in the Merits section,
the Respondent submits that this claim is devoid of any merit.

Claimant’s Position
The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s Temporal Objection.

According to the Claimant, Article 9 of the Treaty, which determines the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction and the scope of the Parties’ consent to arbitration, encompasses disputes that
go beyond interpretation and application of the Treaty itself and includes disputes that
arise from a contract and other rules of law concerning the investment.

In addition, the Claimant submits that Article 9 of the Treaty does not contain any
temporal restriction such as a requirement that a dispute concerning the investment should
have arisen only after the Claimant established or acquired the investment. In this
respect, the Claimant refers to Article 2 of the Treaty which provides that the Treaty
applies to investments “whether made before or after the coming into force of this

Agreement.”®" Furthermore, the Claimant submits as follows:

“Even according to the awards relied on by the Respondent, at the highest, the so-
called Temporal Objection may require consideration of the applicability and
enforceability of the substantive standards of the BIT, ‘where the claim is founded

upon an alleged breach of the Treaty’s substantive standards’.

According to the Claimant, in relation to the treaty claims, the substantive standards of
the Treaty became applicable only when the Claimant “acquired or established” its
investment. According to the Claimant, “while ordinarily this would have been the date
of the SPA, i.e. 7 June 2010, the Claimant proceeds on the basis that its investment was
acquired on 10 August 2010, when approval of BKPM was granted, and the Claimant's
investment was ‘accepted’.”® In its post-hearing briefs, the Claimant modified its

position and argued that the investment’s date is 27 October 2010 (when the Share
Transfer Deeds and the Subscription for New Shares Agreement were executed.)!°° In its
post-hearing brief, the Claimant also stated that, in the alternative, “the date of investment
would, at the latest, be 29 April 2011, when all formalities were complete.”'°!

The Claimant claims that the Gremcitel and Philip Morris awards support its position that
the “critical date” for the temporal consideration is the date that the impugned measure
was published and the claimant “became aware” of the alleged treaty breach,!”

The Claimant submits that it first became aware of the alleged treaty breaches in
April 2011:'%

“In April 2011, after the Claimant invested in SRI, it sought to initiate the procedure

for commencement of mining activities, including obtaining the required Rent-Use
Permit. The Claimant’s representatives approached the Regency Forestry Office at
Tamiang Layang to understand procedural requirements to obtain the required
Rent Use Permit under Forestry Regulation 18/2011. However, the officials at the
Regency Forestry Office after sighting the copy of SRI’s Production IUP informed
the Claimant that the mining area had a disputed boundary. The Claimant
immediately sought to obtain maps to verify the position from different authorities,
including, regional, provincial and central level [...)?!*

Therefore, according to the Claimant:

“The ‘critical date’ (at the earliest) so far as these breaches are concerned is, thus,
after the Claimant's investment was “accepted” on 10 August 2010, and after the
BIT’s substantive standards became applicable. Accordingly, the so-called
Temporal Objection is unsustainable, and is liable to be rejected.”!

In this respect, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that the issues of
overlapping licences and uncertain boundaries were a matter of public record prior to

In addition, the Claimant argues that the Respondent committed acts that resulted in
breaches of the Treaty after April 2011. Thus, even assuming arguendo that 12 May 2011,
as Respondent claims, should be regarded as the date of the Claimant’s investment, the
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty occurred thereafter, and the Temporal Objection
should be rejected!’ /nter alia, the Claimant refers to the following alleged acts.

First, the publication in May 2011 by the MEMR of its national reconciliation of data on
TUPs,!°8

Second, the exclusion of SRI Mining Concession from the Clean and Clear Lists on 30
June 2011.'°

Third, the publication by the Respondent of various maps in 2011-2014. In this regard,
the Claimant argues as follows:

“On 12 July 2011, 10 February 2012, 22 October 2013 and 16 January 2014 [...]
different maps were issued by various instrumentalities of the Respondent, which
purported to put the validity of Production IUP No. 569 of 2009 into contention. As
the maps issued by the instrumentality of the Respondent varied from time to time
(illustratively, maps issued by the Director General of Mineral and Coal on 12 July
2011 and 22 October 2013), the Respondent's contention that the position would
have been the same had the Claimant requested such maps in 2009 prior to its
investment, is pure conjecture, untenable and cannot be accepted as correct.
Further, Production IUP No. 569 of 2009 (including the map attached thereto) was
copied to various Central Government and Provincial officers, but there was no
protest notified to the Claimant from any instrumentality of the Respondent between
the time of issuance of Production IUP No. 569 of 2009 on 31 December 2009 and
the acceptance of the Claimant’s investment on 10 August 2010, so as to put the
Claimant to notice or give reason to the Claimant to request maps during this
period.”!"°

Fourth, the alleged issue of the overlapping licences of PT Kodio Multicom and PT MBM
in 2014 and PT PBU in 2016. In this respect, the Claimant argues as follows:

“According to the Statement of Defence, the allegedly overlapping exploration
licenses of PT Kodio Multicom and PT Marangkayu Bara Makarti [PT MBM] were
converted into Production IUPs on I1 March 2014, notwithstanding the
Respondent's knowledge of disputes with the Claimant, including pursuant to the
Claimant’s Trigger Notice dated 28 February 2014.

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

The allegedly overlapping exploration license of PT Putra Bara Utama [PT PBU]
was converted into a Production IUP on 13 October 2016. It is alleged that the
mining area under the aforesaid Production IUP granted to PT Putra Bara Utama
no longer overlaps with SRI’s mining area. The Respondent is conscious of the
aforesaid breaches, but nevertheless contends that no overlapping licenses were
issued “to further companies” after 12 May 2011, which is considered, by the
Respondent to be the alleged date of the Claimant’s investment. [...)?!!!

Finally, as the Respondent acknowledges that the Temporal Objection does not apply to
the divestiture requirement pursuant to Government Regulation No 24 of 2012, no
response was needed on this aspect from the Claimant.

The Tribunal’s Decision

The Temporal Objection is the core argument that the Respondent has utilised to defend
its case.

Several tribunals have wrestled with the argument whether an investment made prior to
the entry into force of a treaty is covered by the treaty. The answer to that question will
depend on the terms of the treaty itself. In the present case, the issue is different, namely
whether an investment made after the acts complained of is covered by the treaty.

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s Temporal Objection could be described as an
objection which relates to the temporal application of the substantive standards as
opposed to jurisdiction ratione temporis. If this were to be the conclusion, while the
Tribunal would still have jurisdiction, the Tribunal would not find any breach of the treaty
in relation to acts that occurred before the Claimant made its investment because at that
time that Respondent did not owe any obligations to the Claimant.

Nevertheless, in light of the consistent case-law of investment treaty tribunals, the
Tribunal shares the view of the tribunal in the Philip Morris case that the theoretical
distinction between jurisdiction ratione temporis and the temporal application of the
substantive standards “is unnecessary when the cause of action is founded upon a treaty

breach” ."?

As explained by the tribunal in the Gremcitel v. Peru award:

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

“[...] it is clear to the Tribunal that, where the claim is founded upon an alleged
breach of the Treaty’s substantive standards, a tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to
a dispute between the host [S]tate and a national or company which has acquired
its protected investment before the alleged breach occurred. In other words, the
Treaty must be in force and the national or company must have already made its
investment when the alleged breach occurs, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction
over a breach of that Treaty’s substantive standards affecting that investment.

This conclusion follows from the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, which
entails that the substantive protections of the BIT apply to the [S]tate conduct that
occurred after these protections became applicable to the eligible investment.
Because the BIT is at the same time the instrument that creates the substantive
obligation forming the basis of the claim before the Tribunal and the instrument
that confers jurisdiction upon the Tribunal, a claimant bringing a claim based on
a Treaty obligation must have owned or controlled the investment when that
obligation was allegedly breached.

[...] [A claimant] must therefore prove that [it] had already acquired [its]
investment at the time of the impugned conduct.”!?

The approach adopted by the Gremcitel award is consistent with the investor-state
jurisprudence.''4 Indeed, it is clear that a pre-existing dispute cannot be protected by a
treaty if there was no protected investment at the time of its violation. The fact that a
protected investor later made an investment in the subject matter of the dispute cannot
convert what was not a treaty violation into a treaty violation simply because the affected
investment is taken over by a protected investor.

The Tribunal was not impressed with the Claimant’s interpretation of the Gremcitel v.
Peru and the Philip Morris awards and the argument that the “critical date” for the
temporal consideration is the date when the impugned measure was published and the
claimant “became aware” of the alleged treaty breach.

Indeed, in the context of dealing with a temporal objection, the tribunal in the GEA Group
AG case rejected an identical submission concerning the alleged requirement of the
claimant’s awareness of the treaty breach and held that “[clontrary to the Claimant’s

assertions, the Tribunal’s analysis cannot hinge on whether the Claimant knew of
Ukraine’s purported treaty violations.”|'

In light of this consistent case-law, perhaps it is not surprising that the Claimant’s Counsel
did not repeat this line of interpretation of the Gremcitel and the Philip Morris awards at
the main hearing.

While the Parties disagree on the date on which the Claimant made its investment (i.e.
12 May 2011 according to the Respondent and 7 June 2010, 10 August 2010 or
27 October 2010 according to the Claimant), it is clear that the issuance of the overlapping
licences, which stands at the centre of the Claimant’s claim in its written pleadings, is
either outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or contrary to the principle of non-
retroactivity as enshrined in Article 13 of the International Law Commission’s Articles
on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.

On the other hand, the Tribunal does have jurisdiction in relation to the acts that occurred
after the Claimant’s alleged investment and may have breached the BIT. Those acts were
summarised by the Claimant’s Counsel at the main hearing as follows: (i) the failure to
resolve the problem of the overlapping licences; and (ii) the divestiture requirement of
Government Regulation No 24 of 2012.'!° As both of those acts occurred after 12 May
2011, and in view of the Tribunal’s finding on the merits of the case set out below, it is
not necessary for the Tribunal to decide between the Claimant’s and Respondent’s
submissions concerning the exact date of the Claimant’s investment.

The Tribunal notes that while the Respondent accepts that the adoption of Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012 is within the Tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction, the Respondent
submits that the failure to resolve the overlapping boundaries and licences is not an
independent treaty breach which is within the Tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction.

However, in light of the Tribunal’s conclusion regarding the merits of the Claimant’s
case, the Tribunal does not need to decide on the jurisdictional ramifications of the
Respondent’s distinction between a continuing act and an act which is already completed
but continues to cause loss or damage. The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the
presumption that it has jurisdiction to examine both the adoption of Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012 and the alleged failure to resolve the overlapping boundaries
licences.

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

Finally, in the context of the jurisdictional Temporal Objection, the Tribunal notes that it
is regretted that the Respondent did not bring forward this objection when it made its
request to bifurcate the jurisdictional stage from the merits stage. Had the Tribunal and
the Claimant known about the Temporal Objection, it is likely that the Tribunal would
have accepted the Respondent’s bifurcation request or at least suggested to the Parties to
bifurcate the quantum phase. The Tribunal will return to this point at the cost section
below.

The Legality Objection
Article 1(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:

“Investment’ means every kind of asset established or acquired, including changes
in the form of such investment, in accordance with the national laws and regulations
of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made.”

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that pursuant to Article 1(1) of the Treaty, protected investments
must be “established or acquired [...] in accordance with the national laws and
regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made.” If an
investment is not established or acquired in accordance with Indonesian law, it is not an
investment as defined in the Treaty and it is outside the scope of protection of the
Treaty.'!”

The Respondent avers as follows:

“The Respondent's case is not that IMFA’s alleged investment is illegal; it is merely
that its alleged investment is not recognised under Indonesian law and, as a result,
it cannot be established or acquired in accordance with Indonesian law and
therefore cannot satisfy the legality requirements of Article 1(1) of the Treaty.”"'8

The Respondent claims that the Claimant was obliged to comply with the CIL, BKPM
Regulation No 12 of 2009, and Indonesia’s Company Law (Law No 40 of 2007) when it
established or acquired its purported investment in Indonesia. According to the

PCA CasE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

Respondent, the Claimant does not deny that it was obliged to comply with those relevant
provisions of Indonesian law.'!?

The Respondent submits that the CIL is intended, inter alia, to “subject direct investments
in Indonesia to an approval process by BKPM for the purpose of developing the
rd : ina form ble to Ind 7 22120

According to Article 2 of the CIL, the CIL applies to “capital investments in all sectors
in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia.” The Elucidation of Article 2 provides that
“[i]nvestments in all sectors in the Republic of Indonesia shall mean direct investment by

excluding indirect or portfolio investment.”'?!

According to the Respondent, the position that Indonesian law does not recognise indirect
investments is also supported by other provisions of the CIL such as Article 5(2) of the
CIL, which provides in part that “foreign capital investment is obliged to be in the form
of a limited liability company pursuant to Indonesian law”. Similarly, Article 5(3)
identifies permissible means of making a capital investment in Indonesia, which includes
“purchasing shares.”'"* The requirement to comply with the provisions of Article 5 is
underlined by Article 25(1) of the CIL, which elaborates that: “A capital investor who
intends to carry out capital investment in Indonesia shall comply with Article 5 of this

Law.!3

In the same vein, BKPM Regulation No 12, which was in force at the time of the
Claimant’s purported investment, required that a foreign capital investment in the coal
mining sector be made in the form of a limited liability company.!*4

Therefore, the Respondent submits as follows:

“{...] Indonesian law required the Claimant to make an investment in Indonesia in
the form of a ‘limited liability company’ and the Claimant was required to make
this investment ‘directly’, But the Claimant's purported investment was not made
by it; rather the only investment in Indonesia in accordance with Indonesian law

was made by Indmet Mining Pte Ltd, a Singaporean company, which acquired 70%
of the shares in SRI”'?5

126. In addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s purported investment in

12s

126

127

Indonesia was not “established” or “acquired” in accordance with Indonesian law
because “it failed to comply with the requirement under Indonesian law that all foreign
investment be approved, and in particular that investment in the coal mining sector be
approved by BKPM”."*° According to the Respondent, only Indmet’s investment was
approved by BKPM and not the Claimant’s purported investment.'?’ In this respect, the
Respondent submits as follows:

“(A) On 7 June 2010, Indmet allegedly entered into a conditional SPA with
Mr Widyasakta and Mr Fanani, neither of whom were at the time shareholders in
SRI. In the SPA, Indmet agreed to acquire 70% of the issued share capital of the
company. IMFA has not provided any details of Indmet’s actual share acquisition,
but based on the records of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Indmet may
have acquired 1,000 existing shares and subscribed to 2,500 new shares in SRI.

(B) On 5 August 2010, SRI applied to the Indonesian Investment Coordination
Board, or BKPM, for permission to become a foreign capital investment company
(known in Indonesian as a ‘penanaman modal asing’ (‘PMA Company ’)), and SRI
also applied to BKPM for an ‘in principle licence’ (known in Indonesian as an
‘izin prinsip penanaman modal’) for carrying out its capital investment. Together
with its application, SRI provided to BKPM the Memorandum of Association and
Articles of Association of Indmet, as well as the Singapore company search report
for Indmet. This showed that Indmet (Mauritius) Ltd was the sole shareholder. SRI
did not provide any information to BKPM concerning the Claimant.

(C) On 10 August 2010, BKPM granted permission to SRI to become a PMA
Company, and also granted SRI an “in principle licence”, with a duration of five
years, namely from 10 August 2010 until 10 August 2015. Following the grant of
the ‘in principle licence’, it was possible for Indmet to acquire shares in SRI.

(D) On 29 March 2011, the shareholders in SRI resolved (i) to transfer to Indmet
the shares in SRI pursuant to the SPA; and (ii) to increase the capital in SRI for
Indmet’s subscription. On 29 April 2011 the Ministry of Law approved the increase
in SRI’s capital but Indmet's subscription to the 2,500 shares could not become
effective until SRI’s Articles of Association were amended.

(E) SRI’s Articles of Association were amended with effect from 12 May 2011, with
the effect of the amendment being that foreign individuals or companies would be
able to become shareholders in SRI. Prior to this amendment being made, it was

PCA CasE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

not possible for Indmet (or any other foreign individual or company) to own shares
in SRI. Thus, as a matter of Indonesian law, Indmet was not able to acquire shares
in SRI before 12 May 2011.

As appears from the record, the Claimant, IMFA, never made any application to
BKPM to seek approval of its investment in Indonesia. The Claimant's name does
not appear on the application to BKPM dated 5 August 2010, and, as noted above,
SRI provided no information about the Claimant to BKPM.

The simple fact is that the Claimant did not seek the approval of BKPM for its
purported acquisition of shares in SRI and its purported interest in the ‘Production
Operating Mining Business Licence’, and BKPM could not, and would not, have
given its approval. What is important for BKPM, and Indonesian law, is the identity
of the direct shareholder in SRI, which is, of course, Indmet. The Claimant is not in
the picture and has therefore not ‘established’ or ‘acquired’ an investment in
accordance with Indonesian law for the purposes of Article 1(1) of the BIT. The
Claimant's purported investment is thus outside the scope of protection of the BIT,
and, accordingly, outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”

127. Finally, the Respondent explicitly rejects the Claimant’s argument that Indonesia’s law

129

“are not intended to screen or identify foreign investors.” In this respect, the
Respondent submits as follows:

“The Respondent's legislation which governs foreign investment clearly and
unequivocally applies to direct investment, and does not apply to indirect
investment. Indirect investment is a concept which is not recognised as a matter of
Indonesian law. This is why it is not possible for a foreign investor to make an
‘indirect investment’ into Indonesia. Such an investment would not receive the
approval of BKPM.

On this issue, a glance at various other BIT claims that have been brought against
Indonesia confirm that the accepted structure is for the foreign investor which seeks
BIT protection to acquire shares directly in an Indonesian company. Thus, in
Churchill Mining ple v Indonesia, the claimant, Churchill Mining plc, directly
acquired 95% of the shares in the Indonesian PMA company ‘PT Indonesia Coal
Development’; and in Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Indonesia, the claimant, Planet
Mining Pty Ltd, directly acquired 5% of the shares in the Indonesian PMA
Company, ‘PT Indonesia Coal Development’. In the Rafat Ali Rizvi v Indonesia
case, the claimant had invested indirectly in an Indonesian bank via a company
incorporated in the Bahamas, and the ICSID tribimal found that it had no

Jurisdiction (albeit on grounds which made it unnecessary for it to decide whether
the claimant’s ‘indirect’ investment was protected by the BIT)”

Claimant’s Position

At the outset, the Claimant submits that it has made protected investments in Indonesia
within Article 1(1) and Article 2 of the BIT.'?!

According to the Claimant, the definition of investment is broad:

“The definition of ‘investment’, set forth in Article 1(1) of the BIT, encompasses
‘every kind of asset’, and as an adjunct, illustrates the broad types of qualifying
‘investment’, through supplying a list of non-exclusive and non-exhaustive
categories of investments. [...] Most notably, Article 1(1) expressly includes both
primary assets and rights related to such assets. Both ‘shares in’ and ‘concession’,
are expressly included within Article 1(1), and rights flowing as a corollary to
holding shares and/or a mining concession, are thus eligible to protection under
the BIT,”

The Claimant describes its protected investments as follows:

“The Claimant has assets which constitute an investment, both directly and
indirectly, in accordance with the national laws and regulations of Indonesia,
which fall within the scope of Article 1(1) of the BIT.

The Claimant’s investment, for the purposes of Article 1(1) of the BIT, include
(without limitation) the following:

(a) The Claimant’s majority equity interests of 70%, held through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Indmet (incorporated in Singapore as a special purpose vehicle for
purposes of investing in Indonesia), in SRI.

(b) The Production Operation Mining Business License/Production IUP/mining
concession held by the Claimant, through SRI.""3

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

Primarily, it submits that the Treaty does not contain any express exclusion of indirect
investments. According to the Claimant, “[a]rbitral tribunals adjudicating bilateral
investment treaty disputes have consistently held that indirect investments, such as shares
held through intermediary companies, are a protected form of investment absent any

limitations in the applicable definition of an ‘in visa

 

In this regard, the Claimant argues that the CIL has no application for determining the
scope of protection under the Treaty.'?°

With regard to the Respondent’s specific claims concerning the Legality Objection, the
Claimant cites with approval the Saba Fakes v. Turkey award, which states that “a host
State should not be in a position to rely on its domestic legislation beyond the sphere of

investment regime to escape its international undertakings vis-a-vis investments made in
its territory.”°°

According to the Claimant, it incorporated Indmet “as a vehicle to make its investment in
Indonesia. While it was the Singapore company in whose name the shares were acquired,
the Claimant was the hundred percent shareholder parent company.”'3"

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument concerning the alleged missing
information regarding Indmet’s upstream parent company in the application to BKPM
dated 5 August 2010:

“The objection that details of the Singaporean company’s upstream parent
company were not filed is not based on any regulatory requirement in Indonesia,
and it is not the Respondent’s case that the holding of such upstream shareholding
by the Claimant was in breach of the regulatory requirements in Indonesia. There
is no suggestion from the Respondent that unrelated to treaty issues, there was

anything amiss in the acquisition of indirect equity interests by the Claimant in SRI
~no issue has been raised by the Respondent in this regard, prior to or independent
of these proceedings.”'8

The Claimant also submits that its investment is not an “indirect investment” as
contemplated in the Elucidation to Article 2 of the 2007 Investment Law, which refers to
share acquisitions on the Indonesian stock exchange. In that respect, the Claimant submits
as follows:

“The definition of “investment” in Law No.1 of 1967 — which the Respondent
contends is carried into the 2007 Investment Law - does not cover holding shares
in a publicly listed company. The Elucidation to Article 2 of the 2007 Investment
Law purports to exclude such indirect investments and portfolio investments — the
Claimant’s investment does not qualify as an indirect investment. As indirect
investments are not administered by the BKPM, the grant of BKPM approval for
foreign investment in SRI establishes that such foreign investment is not indirect
investment.”

The Claimant claims that its investment in the coal mining sector was approved by
BKPM. According to the Claimant, the “BKPM approval for foreign investment in SRI is
on record. The approval is for foreign investment in the coal mining sector, and contains
a specific reference to Production IUP No. 569 of 2009.”'*

Finally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that “[w]hat is important for
BKPM, and Indonesian law, is the identity of the direct shareholder in SR1.”'*' In this
respect, the Claimant submits as follows:

“As evident from the record, the creation of this structure for the Claimant’s
investment was for a genuine corporate purpose, on advice received from
PriceWaterhouse Coopers. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of 70% interests
in the coal concession held by PT SRI was routed through wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Claimant in Mauritius (Indmet (Mauritius) Ltd.) and Singapore
(Indmet Mining Pte Ltd.), a holding structure specifically put into place for this
purpose. BKPM Regulation No.12 of 2009 does not prohibit this. Indeed, by
permitting foreign investment by a foreign body corporate, BKPM Regulation
No.12 of 2009 contemplates that the legal owner of the shares in the PMA Company
may well be a wholly-owned investment vehicle of another foreign body corporate.

PCA Case No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

As the Respondent's laws ‘concerning foreign investment’ are not intended to
screen or identify foreign investors, but are intended to channelize [sic] foreign
investment to areas of the Respondent's economy where it is most needed, BKPM
Regulation No.12 of 2009 does not concern itself with ownership interests above
the legal owner of the shares in the PMA Company. The allegation that BKPM
could not have given its approval is incorrect. The allegation that BKPM would not
have given its approval, is irrelevant — BKPM has granted its approval for foreign
investment in SRI, with knowledge of the upstream beneficial ownership lying in
India. The Respondent is unable to identify any reason why the BKPM would have
declined permission had it known that the Claimant is the parent company.”?'?

The Tribunal’s Decision

As acknowledged by the Respondent’s Counsel at the main hearing, the Legality
Objection is intertwined with the No Acceptance Objection and the No Acceptance
Objection is the stronger of the two objections.'# It is clear to the Tribunal that the
Legality is dependent on the No Acceptance Objection. Therefore, the Tribunal will deal
with the Legality Objection together with the No Acceptance Objection below.

The No Acceptance Objection

. Article 2 of the Treaty provides as follows:

“This Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of either
Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, accepted as such
in accordance with its laws and regulations in force concerning foreign
investments, whether made before or after the coming into force of the Agreement.”

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the “requirement that an investment be ‘accepted’ in
accordance with the laws and regulations in force concerning foreign investments is a
related, but analytically separate, jurisdictional objection from the Respondent's Legality
Objection.”

AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

The Respondent maintains that while provisions such as Article 2 of the Treaty are
expressed as containing a requirement that qualifying investments be “admitted” or
“granted admission” in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State, “it is
clear from the arbitral practice on ‘acceptance’ or ‘admission’ provisions that these
terms are used interchangeably."

According to the Respondent, the “admission” or “acceptance” provisions are considered
jurisdictional requirements in light of multiple decisions and awards.'*

The Respondent repeats its argument that the Claimant failed to make its investment
directly and therefore the investment was also neither “accepted” nor “admitted”.!*7 In
addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s purported investment in Indonesia
was neither “accepted” nor “admitted” in accordance with Indonesian law because
foreign investments in the coal mining sector needed to be approved by BKPM in light
of the Mineral Resource’s Regulation No 5 of 2010.'48

In response to the Claimant’s argument that “the BKPM approval for foreign investment
in SRI is on record,”’"? the Respondent repeats the same argument of the Legality
Objection, i.e. that it was SRI that applied to BKPM and not the Claimant.'*? In this
respect, the Respondent submits as follows:

 

“T]he Claimant’s in has not been ‘accepted’ within the ing of Article
2 of the BIT, because it has not been accepted as an ‘investment’ which has been
‘made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party’. What the Respondent, through the BKPM, has ‘accepted’, or
‘admitted’, or ‘approved’ is an investment of Indmet Mining Pte Ltd, a Singaporean
company. This is quite obviously not an acceptance of an ‘investment’ which has
been ‘made by [an investor] of [the other] Contracting Party’ for the purposes of
Article 2 of the BIT. The Claimant's purported investment has not been ‘accepted’.
Moreover, SRI did not even disclose to BKPM the Claimant’s role as the indirect
parent company of Indmet Mining Pte Ltd.

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

In sum, the simple fact is that the Claimant never sought the approval of BKPM for
its purported indirect acquisition of shares in SRI and its purported interest in the
Production IUP No 569 of 2009, and BKPM could not have given its approval.
What is important for BKPM is the identity of the direct shareholder in SRI, which
is Indmet Mining Pte Ltd. The Claimant and the Claimant’s purported investment
are therefore outside the scope of protection of the BIT.”'>!

Finally, the Respondent relies on textual interpretation of the wording of Article 2 to
support its jurisdictional objection. The Respondent submits that the words “as such”
refer back to the words “investment” and the phrase “investor of either state” and
accordingly jurisdiction is limited to Indian not Singaporean investors/investments.'? In
this regard, the Respondent further submits as follows:

“The words ‘accepted as such’ and the specific reference to the host State’s ‘laws
and regulations in force concerning foreign investments’ do not appear elsewhere
in the BIT. [...] The insertion of these additional words in Article 2 strengthens the
Respondent’s case that Article 2 means what it says.

While these words ‘accepted as such’ were not present in the UK-Indonesia BIT
that was considered in the Rizvi case, the words relied upon by the Rizvi tribunal
accepted ‘in accordance with’ are. It was these words which led the Rizvi tribunal
to reiterate that the purported investment must actually be accepted to fall within
the scope of the BIT under Article 2, it is not enough that the investment was
‘commenced without contradicting’ the host State's foreign investor law or that the
‘investment is generally lawful."

Claimant’s Position

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s No Acceptance Objection, which according to the
Claimant is in substance “a repetition of the allegations relating to the Legality
Objection.”!*

Tribunal’s Decision

The Claimant is correct to point out that the Respondent’s No Acceptance Objection and
Legality Objection involve the same question: whether the Claimant’s investment, i.e. its
purchase of shares in SRI, was established and accepted in Indonesia in accordance with
the law in Indonesia.

jurisdictional requirement, '°> they disagree whether the Claimant’s investment was
accepted. The Claimant’s argument is that its investment, which was made via Indmet,
was accepted by BKPM and therefore the Tribunal should reject the Respondent’s No
Acceptance Objection and Legality Objection. On the other hand, the Respondent submits
that it was Indmet’s investment in SRI that was approved by BKPM not the Claimant’s
investment and therefore the Claimant’s investment was neither established nor accepted
in Indonesia.

Although the Tribunal accepts that the issue whether the Claimant’s investment was
accepted is highly questionable in view of the language used in Article 2 of the Treaty,
nevertheless, this difficult jurisdictional and textual question need not be decided in light
of the Tribunal’s conclusions below regarding the merits of the Claimant’s case
concerning the adoption of Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 and the alleged failure
to resolve the overlapping licences.

The Indirect Investment Objection

Article 1(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:
“ Investment’ means every kind of asset established or acquired, including changes
in the form of such investment, in accordance with the national laws and
regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made and

in particular, though not exchisively, includes:

(i) movable and immovable property as well as other rights such as mortgages,
liens or pledges,

(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other similar forms
of participation in a company;

(iii) rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;

(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how in

(v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, inchiding concessions

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s asserted investments, namely the
shareholding in SRI and the Production IUP No 569, are not held directly by the Claimant.

The alleged 70% shares in SRI were acquired by the Claimant’s indirect subsidiary,
Indmet, which as per the Claimant was at the time of the acquisition a subsidiary of
Indmet (Mauritius) Ltd, which was in turn wholly owned and controlled by the
Claimant.'*¢ The shares in SRI are still held directly by Indmet and not by the Claimant
itself.!5” As for Production IUP No 569, this is held by the Claimant indirectly via SRI.!%*

The Respondent submits that Article 1(1) of the Treaty protects only direct investments,
i.e. investments that are held directly by the Claimant. As the Claimant does not hold any
investments directly, it does not have a protected investment.

The Respondent highlights that Article 1(1) of the Treaty does not expressly include
investments which are owned or controlled “indirectly”, which is in contrast with other
BITs which do expressly provide for the protection of indirect investments, including (for
instance) Indonesia’s BIT with Australia.!°?

The Respondent relies on the VCLT to support its argument that Article 1(1) does not
protect direct investments. Article 31(1) of VCLT provides as follows:

“A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose.”

In addition, the Respondent relies on the principle of effectiveness and claims that the
“good faith” interpretation of a treaty requires that each provision of the treaty be given
a meaning and effect.'®°

The Respondent submits the argument that Article 1(1) only protects direct investment is
supported by the context of the Treaty. '*' According to the Respondent, relevant
“context” for the interpretation of Article 1(1) includes in particular Articles 2, 4(1), 5(1),
and 5(3) of the Treaty. In this respect, the Respondent argues as follows:

“(A) Article 2 is the ‘scope of application’ provision, which provides that the BIT
‘shall apply to all investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the
territory of the other Contracting Party’. This indicates that the purported
investment must have been actually made by the Indian investor, rather than by an
investor of a third State, which is the case as regards the alleged acquisition of

shares in SRI. A broader formulation could have been adopted by the Contracting
Parties, but they did not do so.

(B) Also with regard to Article 2, this requires that the putative investment be made
‘in the territory of the other Contracting Party’. But the Claimant, IMFA, did not
make an investment in the territory of the Respondent. Rather, it was Indmet Mining
Pte Ltd which purportedly acquired shares in the Indonesian company SRI.

(©) As for Article 4(1), the Contracting Parties have an obligation under this
provision to provide most-favoured-nation treatment to ‘investments made by
investors of [the other] Contracting Party.’ Again, a broader formulation could
have been adopted by the Contracting Parties, but they did not do so.”!?

159, With regard to Articles 5(1)'® and 5(3)'®! of the Treaty, the Respondent submits as

162

165

follows:

“{...] The BIT here makes provision for the situation where the host State of an
investment ‘expropriates’ the assets of a locally incorporated company in which the
purported investor holds shares. This is the manner in which the BIT provides
protection for assets which are held ‘indirectly’, and this demonstrates that the
Contracting Parties expressly turned their minds to this issue. Thus, Article 5(3)
would be applicable if it were the case that the Claimant owned the shares in SRI
directly, and the assets of SRI ~ such as Production IUP No 569 of 2009 — were
expropriated. This would activate Article 5(3) of the BIT, and the Respondent would
be under an obligation to ‘ensure that provisions of [Article 5(1)] [were] applied to
the extent necessary to ensure fair and equitable compensation in respect of their
investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party [i.e. IMFA] who are
owners of those shares [in SRI].’

In this scenario, if it were the case that the definition of “investment” already
protected such assets (because it inchides both “direct” and “indirect”
investments), then the inclusion of Article 5(3) would serve no purpose. This would
be contrary to the principle of effectiveness (or effet utile) which is an essentially
element of the good faith interpretation of treaties.”"'%

Rejoinder, para. 16.13.

Article 5(1) of the Treaty: “/nvestments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised,
expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as ‘expropriation’) in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a
public purpose in accordance with law on a non-discriminatory basis and against fair and equitable
compensation.”

Article 5(3) of the Treaty: “Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is
incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its territory, and in which investors of the
other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are
applied to the extent necessary to ensure fair and equitable compensation in respect of their investment to
such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.”

160. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s interpretation of Article 5(3) of the Treaty.'® In

161.

particular the Respondent argues that it is “incorrect to say that Article 5(3) ‘is taking a
‘belt and braces’ approach to the compensation mechanism for expropriation.’ To the
contrary, Article 5(3) offers protection which is not otherwise available under the BIT.”"°"

Similarly, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that Article 5(3) was included
“for the avoidance of doubt.” The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s argument
is “inconsistent with the principle of effectiveness in treaty interpretation (effet utile),
according to which treaties should be interpreted so as to give each provision
meaning.” Accordingly, the Respondent argues as follows:

“{...] An interpretation that takes the specific inclusion of indirect investments in
the expropriation clause to be an exercise in abundant caution can only be justified
when the treaty already refers to ‘direct or indirect’ investments. In this regard, the
Claimant also refers to a number of treaties in which the definition of “investment”
is silent as to whether it covers indirect investments, but an equivalent provision of
Article 5(3) includes the wording ‘for avoidance of doubt’. As regards these
treaties, this cannot be interpreted as meaning that the term ‘investment’ already
includes ‘indirect’ investments. To claim that a treaty includes indirect investments
— which magnifies the scope of its protection greatly — by way of a backdoor
purported ‘abundant caution’, when it neglects to mention the topic head-on in the
relevant provision defining an ‘investment’ does violence to the text.

Thus, where treaties do refer to ‘direct or indirect investments’, Article 5(3) or its
equivalents can possibly be read as confirming what is otherwise present. This
comports with the text, by giving an internally coherent meaning to both the
definition of ‘investment’ and the extension of expropriation to ‘indirect’
investment. But, as in the second class of treaties, where the definition of
‘investment’ does not include indirect investments, it cannot be said that Article
5(3) is nonetheless an exercise in abundant caution. In such treaties, the natural
interpretation must, and can only, be that the definition of ‘investment’ otherwise
excludes ‘indirect’ investment. Such an interpretation, the Respondent notes, makes
sense not only of the divergence in treaty practice on this point, but also provides a
meaning that is internally coherent within the text of each treaty.”'”

162. The Respondent also submits that its proposed interpretation of the term “investment” is

“Importantly, the object and purpose of the BIT is not simply the protection of
foreign investment; the preamble of the BIT, which sheds light on the object and
purpose, also refers expressly to creating conditions for flow of capital between
Indonesia and India and increasing prosperity in both States. In line with the broad
objectives of the BIT, the Tribunal is required to adopt a balanced approach in the
interpretation of treaties and not interpret its clauses exchisively and / or
excessively in favour of investors.’"'7!

Finally, in relation to the Claimant’s argument that the definition of “investment” is broad
in the sense that it covers a wide range of assets, the Respondent submits that this “cannot
be understood as also meaning that the Contracting Parties to the BIT have agreed that

it does not matter whether such ‘assets’ are owned directly or not.”!

Claimant’s Position

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 1(1) and submits that the
Treaty protects direct and indirect investments.'7>

According to the Claimant, the parties to the Treaty did provide for the inclusion of indirect
investments by adopting a broad definition of investment, which includes “every kind of

asset."

Moreover, the Claimant submits that even if assumed arguendo that the Treaty is silent
on the issue of indirect investment, given the broad definition of investment in the
Treaty, the treaty parties should have used clear language to exclude indirect
investments.!75

In addition, the Claimant submits that the “absence of the word ‘directly’ is as
conspicuous as the absence of ‘indirectly’, that the Respondent chooses to rely upon. In
these circumstances, the only appropriate conclusion is that there was no limit on the
directness of the way the investment can be held, or exclusion of investments not so
held.”\®

Furthermore, the Claimant reiterates its argument that arbitral tribunals consistently held
that indirect investments, such as shares held through intermediary companies, are a

protected form of investment absent any limitations in the applicable definition of an
investment.!””

According to the Claimant, the object and purpose of the Treaty is, in the words of the
preamble, to “create conditions favourable for fostering greater investment by investors
of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.” Such object and
purpose would be frustrated by excluding indirect investments, including shareholding
investments held through intermediary companies.'7*

The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s argument on the context of the Treaty and its
reliance on Articles 2, 4(1), 5(1) and 5(3) of the Treaty.!7?

In particular, the Claimant submits that “it is evident that the use of the words ‘made by’ in
Article 2 [of the Treaty] was not with the intention of excluding indirect investments from
the scope and applicability of the BIT.”'®° In addition, the Claimant submits as follows:

“In any event, the facts and circumstances in the present case establish that the
investment in SRI and the corollary interests in Production IUP No.569 of 2009 has
been made by the Claimant. It is the Claimant that was considering the acquisition
of mines outside India — in Indonesia, Turkey, Albania, Mozambique and elsewhere.
It is the Claimant’s employees that conducted prior enquiries into such potential
acquisitions. It is the Claimant’s employees that conducted an evaluation of mineral
reserves of coal mines being considered for acquisition. It is the Claimant that
caused incorporation of Indmet. The Claimant arranged all payments towards
acquisition of 70% indirect interests in the SRI coal mining concession,
aggregating US$8.75 million, to be infused into and wired through its wholly owned
subsidiaries in Mauritius and Singapore, in manner nominated by sellers of the SRI
coal mining concession. The Claimant availed a US$15 million loan facility from
Standard Chartered Bank, Kolkata, India, for finding the acquisition of equity
interests in the SRI coal mining concession and related working capital
requirements, based on Profitability Projections submitted by the Claimant. The
facts on record establish that the investment is made by the Claimant.”'*!

172. The Claimant also submits there are three main flaws in the Respondent's interpretation

7

of Article 5(3) of the Treaty: (i) Article 5(3) has a different purpose, (ii), there are
numerous treaties containing both an express coverage of direct and indirect investments

and a provision equivalent to Article 5(3); (iii) the case-law does not support the
Respondent’s position.

173. First, the Claimant argues that Article 5(3) of the Treaty has a different purpose than the
one suggested by the Respondent.'*? The Claimant submits as follows:

“The only logical explanation for the existence of this provision is that it makes
clear the manner in which the compensation mechanism will operate in relation to
a specific set of facts, where the calculation of damage to the value of an investment
with different levels of ownership may be complex. This provision sets out

 

unequivocally the parties’ ii ion that comp in such ci es
should be an ‘equitable compensation’.
be]

This reference to ‘investment’ is not phrased to exchide the assets of the company,
or to limit itself to ownership of the shares. Rather, it requires a tribunal to take a
holistic view of the investor's “investment” (looking at both the shareholding and
the underlying assets) in determining what is required in order to compensate for
damage which has been suffered by the investor.

Led

Accordingly, Article 5(3) does not, as the Respondent presents it, extend the
availability of compensation for expropriation to circumstances where it would
otherwise not apply. It is taking a ‘belt and braces’ approach to the compensation
mechanism for expropriation, reflecting the parties' concerns to ensure that
investors are fully compensated for expropriatory action and specifically
addressing a common structure of investment.”'>

 

174, The Claimant also argues that the inclusion of Article 5(3) in the Treaty is “for the
avoidance of doubt”.'** In this respect, the Claimant argues as follows:

“Article 5(3) makes clear that compensating the nationalised domestic entity for the
assets taken away may not be sufficient for the BIT — it is also necessary to make
sure that such compensation was equitable compensation to the owners of the
shares. The question as to whether the owners of those shares are the companies
or entities which are registered holders of such shares, or holding companies which
indirectly own shares through subsidiaries is not addressed by Article 5(3). Thus,
if [...] it is held that investments made through subsidiaries are no less entitled to
treaty protection, Article 5(3) would still be relevant to ensure that in the event of
nationalisation by expropriation of the assets of the domestic company, the ‘owners

of the shares’ (i.e. whether it is the immediate owners or the ultimate owners) are
guaranteed ‘fair and equitable compensation’. Article 5(3) precludes a contention
that no such compensation is payable since it is the assets of the domestic company,
and not its shares (constituting the ‘investment’), that are the subject of
expropriatory measures. The contention that the Claimant's construction would
render Article 5(3) unnecessary or redundant is plainly incorrect.”'*°

Second, the Claimant submits as follows:

“The fact that provisions equivalent to the Expropriation Provision [i.e. Article
5(3) of the Treaty] are inchided ‘for the avoidance of doubt’ both in treaties (i)
that are silent on whether both direct and indirect investments are included, and
(ii) that expressly include both direct and indirect investments in their definition
of investments, undermines the Respondent's argument that such a provision
includes indirect investments, where they are not covered in the definition of
‘investment’.

The existence of such treaties directly contradicts the Respondent's claim that the
purpose of the Expropriation Provision can only be to incorporate protections for
certain types of indirect investments where there would otherwise be none. Indeed,
the clarificatory nature of a provision similar to the Expropriation Provision is
accepted in decisions that the Respondent purports to rely on.”!*6

Third, the Claimant submits that “tribunals which have considered the impact of
equivalent provisions on definitions of investment which are silent on the question of
whether indirect investments are covered, have rejected similar arguments to those of the
Respondent. By contrast, no tribunal has accepted the position for which the Respondent

argues.”'8?

The Tribunal’s Decision

It is not necessary for the Tribunal to decide the issue of Indirect Investment in light of
the Tribunal’s conclusions below regarding the merits of the Claimant’s case concerning
the adoption of Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 and the alleged failure to resolve
the overlapping licences.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal feels obliged to state that it was not persuaded by the
Respondent’s objection.

There is a consistent jurisprudence which supports the conclusion that investment treaties,
including this BIT, that define investments broadly, protect indirect investments as well.

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

This is true regardless of whether there is an explicit reference to direct or indirect
investments in the treaty.'$* The reasoning of the tribunal in the Venezuela Holdings B.V.
case is also apposite for this case:

“The Tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect
investments in the BIT. The definition of investment given in Article 1 is very broad.
It includes ‘every kind of assets’ and enumerates specific categories of investments
as examples. One of those categories consists of ‘shares, bonds or other kinds of
interests in companies and joint ventures’. The plain meaning of this provision is
that shares or other kind of interests held by Dutch shareholders in a company or
in a joint venture having made investment on Venezuelan territory are protected
under Article 1. The BIT does not require that there be no interposed companies
between the ultimate owner of the company or of the joint venture and the
investment. Therefore, a literal reading of the BIT does not support the allegation
that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments. Investments as
defined in Article 1 could be direct or indirect as recognized in similar cases by
ICSID Tribunals.”'°

It is true that Article 5 of the BIT may highlight various questions regarding the
interpretation of the BIT. However, the Tribunal believes that if the Contracting Parties
wanted to exclude indirect investments, in light of the BIT’s broad definition of
investments, the Contracting Parties needed to say it clearly in the Treaty.'?

Merits

The Tribunal now turns to consider the various ways in which the Claimant seeks to put
its case of treaty violation with regard to the two elements of its case that survive the
successful temporal challenge.

See for example, Exhibit CL-11, Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8,

Professor Sornarajah disagrees with this view. In his view, indirect investments are protected only if the
treaty expressly states that they are.

As explained above, the Claimant refers to the following alleged acts which falls outside
the scope of the Temporal Objection and therefore within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction:

(i) The publication in May 2011 by the MEMR of its national reconciliation of data on
TUPs;!?!

(ii) The exclusion of SRI Mining Concession from the Clean and Clear Lists on 30 June
20115!

(iii) The publication by the Respondent of various maps in 201 1- 2014;

(iv) The alleged issue of the overlapping licences of PT Kodio Multicom and PT MBM
in 2014 and PT PBU in 2016; and

(v) Government Regulation No 24 of 2012.

At the hearing, the Claimant’s Counsel clarified that the first four acts can be described
as one alleged impugned measure: the alleged failure to resolve the overlapping licences
and boundary issues.!>

Therefore, the Tribunal now turns to consider the various ways the Claimant puts its case
of treaty breach in relation to the two sole surviving elements of its case after
determination of the temporal issue above, namely the (i) alleged failure to resolve the
overlapping boundaries and licences, and (ii) the divestiture requirement of Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012.

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent in violation of its obligations under the Treaty:

(1) Failed to provide the Claimant’s investment with fair and equitable treatment
(“FET”);

(II) Failed to provide the Claimant’s investment with full protection and security;
(II) Violated the prohibition against unreasonable or discriminatory measures;
(IV) Expropriated the Claimant’s investment without compensation; and

(V) Failed to allow the free transfer of funds related to the Claimant’s investment.

Fair and Equitable Treatment
Article 3(2) of the Treaty provides as follows:

“Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times
be accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting
Party.”

Article 4(1) of the Treaty stipulates as follows:

“Investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party, shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable and not
less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third
State.”

Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the FET standard is not limited to the famous formula of the
Neer case of 1926 and the Tribunal should not rely on it.!%*

Based on various case-law, the Claimant submits that the FET standard today comprises
a set of core investment protections/requirements, including: (1) the protection of the
investor’s legitimate and reasonable expectations; (2) the protection against arbitrariness
or discrimination; (3) requiring the host state to act transparently and consistently; (4)
requiring the host state to act in good faith; (5) due process and procedural propriety; (6)
requiring the host state to act proportionally in its dealings with foreign investors.

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has violated each of the components of the
Treaty’s FET standard.

First, the Claimant argues that the Respondent breached the FET standard by violating
the Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

The Claimant argues that it had the following legitimate expectations:

“(i) Since the Production IUP was granted by a legal decree issued by the Head of
the Regent of [East Barito] Regency, who was conferred autonomous power under
the laws in force in Indonesia at the material time, to grant mining licenses, and
who at the time of grant of the mining license issued a map which formed an integral
part of the legal decree, confirming that the area for which the mining rights were
granted fell squarely within [East Barito] Regency, the Production IUP [No. 569 of
2009] was a valid mining license.

Reply, paras 301-303.

Page 60

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

(ii) SRI had the exclusive right to undertake mining of coal for earning revenues for
a thirty-year term, including two renewals liable to be granted in ordinary course,
ie. for a duration of ten 10 years each.

(iti) All authorities in Indonesia performed their functions in tandem with one
another and would honour the rights granted under a legal decree issued by the
Head of a Regency.

(iv) The boundaries of all regencies and provinces within the State would be
certain, and the map attached with the Production IUP would be uniform and
consistent with all other maps maintained by the Respondent.

(v) The Claimant would not be required to divest any shareholding during the initial
term of the lease and/or during the period of renewal, as SRI was compliant with
the divestment requirements in force at the time of Claimant's investment in SRI.

(vi) The Respondent would uphold the assurances and the guarantees under the
2007 Investment Law, amongst others, of legal certainty, business certainty and
business safety, ”'>

193. In addition, based on Production [UP No. 569 of 2009 and the applicable legal framework,

194.

the Claimant emphasises that it was assured that:

“(i) Production IUP No, 569 of 2009 was granted by the competent authority (the
Bupati of East Barito) since the Mining Permit Area sought was within the East
Barito Regency;

(ii) the Bupati of East Barito was the competent authority to determine the
applicable regional spatial layout plan, and also authorised to issue the map
attached to Production IUP No. 569 of 2009;

(iii) the size and boundaries of the Mining Permit Area, as depicted in the map
attached to Production IUP No. 569 of 2009 was determined by the
Central Government in coordination with the Bupati of East Barito, managed by
the Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources;

(iv) between the regional administrations, there was joint management of licenses
in the use of natural resources. ”!%

The Claimant submits that the Respondent violated the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations as follows:

“[...] the authorities in Indonesia, on account of their systemic failure, have
defeated the rights that were granted under the legal decree and made the
Production IUP wholly unworkable. Subsequent to its investment, the Claimant has

encountered inconsistent positions adopted by various instrumentalities of the
Respondent, wherein it has been claimed that boundaries of various regencies
including Barito Timur Regency and the provinces have, to date, not yet been
determined, leading to conflicting maps maintained by various authorities of the
Respondent, while the mining authorities have knowingly issued multiple mining
licenses in respect of the SRI mining concession area, leading to the Production
IUP held by SRI being rendered infructuous. A complete lack of coordination exists
between the central and regional governments, plagued by utter confusion of
authority between the different levels of government.

Further, by introducing [Government Regulation No 24 of 2012] to increase the
divestment requirement for foreign shareholding from 20% to 51%, the Respondent
has breached the Claimant’s reasonable and legitimate expectation that the policy
in force at the time when the Claimant invested, of 20% Indonesian participation,
would remain consistent, and that the Respondent would not introduce laws
impairing the Claimant’s investment, such that its shareholding would become
liable to be substantially reduced to 42.87% from 70%.”

In addition, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has violated the specific assurances
and guarantees provided under the 2007 Investment Law by failing:

“(i) to ensure certainty of the mining rights granted to SRI under the Production
IUP No. 569 of 2009;

(ii) to ensure certainty of boundaries of its regencies and provinces;

(iii) to ensure safety of the Claimant's interests in the mining business of SRI;

(iv) to ensure certainty of the divestiture requirement for foreign participation;

(v) to ensure a stable legal and business framework and regime, such that would
safeguard and protect the Claimant’s investment.”'8

Second, the Claimant argues that by issuing multiple overlapping licences in respect of

SRI’s mining concession area without any legal basis, the Respondent has breached the
199

 

protection against arbitrariness and discrimination.

Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the omission of SRI’s Production IUP No. 569
of 2009 from the Clean and Clear Lists published in 2011 violated the protection against
arbitrariness and discrimination. In particular, the Claimant elaborates as follows:
“[...] the only mining permit that pre-dates SRI’s mining license, is the alleged
Exploration KP No. 167 of 2006, purportedly granted to PT-BAB on 18 March
2006 by the Regent of South Barito. [...] No material has been furnished by the

Respondent to the Claimant, or available on the record of this arbitration, from the
Respondent, to establish that a valid mining permit in favour of PT-BAB was

granted, and/or that a valid mining permit in favour of PT-BAB was in force on 31
December 2009, when the SRI mining concession was granted. All other allegedly
overlapping mining licenses were admittedly granted subsequent to SRI's
Exploration KP No. 185 of 2006. The Respondent admits to uniformly applying an
alleged ‘first come first served’ principle for resolving conflicts in cases of
overlapping license areas, but fails to explain the basis on which the Respondent
failed to reconcile the SRI coal mining concession with other allegedly overlapping
mining concessions. [...]

When SRI raised the issue of overlapping licenses after it discovered the same in or
about April 2011, it is evident that this principle of ‘first come first served’ was not
applied to SRI, and the Respondent maintains that SRI’s mining permit is impaired
even by subsequently granted mining permits. The non-application of the rules, which
the Respondent claims were otherwise followed, is an arbitrary and discriminatory
measure which is a clear violation of the FET standard imposed by the BIT,’

Furthermore, Claimant argues that the arbitrary and discriminatory behaviour of the
Respondent is clear from the fact that the PT Geo Explo exploration licence No 472 of
2009 was featured in the fifth Clean and Clear List despite the grant of a mining licence
after SRI"!

Finally, in the context of the Respondent’s alleged arbitrary and discriminatory
behaviour, the Claimant submits that when the two entities which had allegedly
overlapping licences in SRI’s mining concession area, PT Kodio Multicom and PT MBM,
were issued Production IUPs on 11 March 2014, “SRI already had a valid production
license for the mining area and [...] requested the instrumentalities of the Respondent to
resolve the issue of non-implementation of license.”

Third, the Claimant submits that the following acts have breached the requirement of
transparency and consistency:

 

“(i) The Respondent issued overlapping licenses in respect of the area which is
squarely within SRI’s Production IUP, without the knowledge of the Claimant;

(ii) The Respondent failed to notify disputed boundaries of regencies and provinces
in Indonesia;

(iii) The Respondent increased the divestment requirement by the foreign
shareholder after the Claimant’s acquisition of 70% shareholding in SRI;

(iv) The Respondent did not inform the Claimant about the process being followed
Sor issuance of the Clean and Clear list, and the reason for non-inclusion of SRI's
Production IUP from the Clean and Clear list.

(v) The maps issued by the Respondent showed inconsistent positions with regard
to the area under the Production IUP held by SRI.

(vi) As seen from the various maps obtained by the Claimant from different
authorities, it is clear that while certain divisions of the Respondent have updated
their record to reflect the correct status of SRI’s mining licence as a Production
IUP, other divisions continue to reflect SRI’s mining licence at the Exploration
stage.”

Fourth, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has not acted in good faith by
legislating the 2007 Investment Law, which inter alia guaranteed legal certainty, on the
one hand, and by introducing Government Regulation No 24 of 2012, which increased
the divestiture requirements for foreign investors, on the other hand.” In addition, the
Claimant argues that the facts that constitute an arbitrary and discriminatory treatment
equally constitute a breach of the good faith principle.2°>

Fifth, the Claimant argues that the Respondent violated the requirement of due process
and procedural propriety “by failing to honour the legal decree issued by the Head of the
Regent of East Barito Regency, leading to non-implementation of the Production IUP No.
569 of 2009”. As with the good faith requirement, the Claimant argues that the same
facts that constitute an arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, equally constitute a
violation of procedural propriety and due process standards?”

Sixth, the Claimant submits that the cumulative actions of the Respondent have breached
the proportionality principle of the FET standard.?°8

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

The Respondent submits that the FET standard under Article 3(2) of the Treaty is intended
to reflect the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.” According
to the Respondent, despite the inconsistent arbitral awards practice on the precise content
of the FET standard, it “is clear is that the award of the United States — Mexican Claims
Commission in the Neer claim remains influential in identifying what is required of States
under that standard.’?'°

The Respondent submits that in determining claims for breach of the FET standard, the
Tribunal should bear in mind that BITs are not “inswrance policies” for bad business
decisions and investors must take the host State as they find it. In addition, the Tribunal has
to take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances about the host state and the
investor’s conduct, including the requirement for investors to carry out due diligence before
making an investment decision"!

In this respect, the Respondent submits as follows:

“Indonesia went through a reformation of its political system and economy
following the 1998 economic crisis and the fall of former President Suharto,
which resulted in rapid decentralisation and implementation of regional

R, “D],

. A ies became resp jor eing and regulating areas of
activity which had been previously centralised and with which they had no
experience. The implementation of regional autonomy had a particular impact on
the mining industry and this is the context in which IMFA chose to invest."

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s arguments regarding the alleged breaches of the
different components of the FET standard.

First, in respect of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations argument, the Respondent
submits that a legitimate expectation must be based on a specific commitment made by
the host State that is reasonable in light of the circumstances and relied upon by the
investor when deciding to invest or making the investment.?!

According to the Respondent, the Claimant cannot have any of the legitimate expectations
which it claims to have because it failed to undertake the due diligence expected of a

reasonable prudent investor. *!* Had the Claimant made any enquiries prior to its
investment at the Ministry of Forestry or MEMR, the Regency Forestry Office or
neighbouring Regencies, it would have discovered the boundary issues with SRI’s
Production IUP.?'5 In particular the Respondent submits as follows:

“The Claimant's failure to undertake proper due diligence is inexplicable given the
notorious nature of the overlapping mining licences issue, the difficulties in
obtaining a Borrow Use Permit which was required to undertake mining activities
in production forests, the well-known potential for regional boundary disputes, the
bureaucratic permitting process and the lack of infrastructure and difficulties in
developing that infrastructure.”*!

The Respondent denies the Claimant’s argument with regard to its legitimate expectation
in the context of Government Regulation No 24 of 2012. The Respondent submits that “‘it
is clear that the protection of legitimate expectations does not amount to an acceptance by
the host State that it must refrain from any future legislative amendments,”?"

Moreover, the Respondent states the divestiture requirements under Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012 do not apply until five years after coal production has
commenced.”!® According to the Respondent, as the Claimant’s coal production has not
started and the grant of the SRI Mining Concession was just one step in a long process,
there were significant legal requirements and practical obstacles to overcome before SRI
could undertake any mining activity. Therefore, Government Regulation No 24 of 2012
has no application to the Claimant’s claim.?!? In addition, the Respondent submits as
follows:

“[elven if the divestiture requirements under Government Regulation No. 24 of
2012 were to apply, those requirements would not apply in full immediately. The
percentage of shares which SRI’s direct shareholder would have to divest would
increase gradually over a five-year period [...]. SRI’s direct shareholder would
receive compensation for any shares it was required to divest.”

The Respondent also submits that the Claimant could not have had any legitimate
expectations in respect of 2007 Investment Law because the Claimant was not an investor

for the purposes of that law and therefore had no protections under it.?”! In addition, the
Respondent states that it does not admit that the Claimant relied on a presumption that
Indonesian law would not change.”??

According to the Respondent:

“Contrary to the Claimant's allegations, the Claimant's only legitimate expectation

should have been that it would need to satisfy the requirements of all relevant
departments and levels of government before its project could proceed. The
Claimant has failed to provide particulars of its attempts to satisfy these
requirements, which naturally exist in a major project of this type and alleged
scale.”

Second, the Respondent denies that it has accorded the Claimant treatment which is
arbitrary or discriminatory either generally or with particular respect to the issuance of
Clean and Clear lists.2*4 According to the Respondent:

 

“The SRI Concession was not on the Clean and Clear List because there was an
overlap with an administrative area of another Regency or Province and there were
also overlapping licences.’””?5

In addition, the Respondent submits as follows:

“In any event the first come first served principle is of limited assistance to SRI and
IMFA as SRI has not held a continuous mining licence over the relevant area, as:
(A) Exploration KP No 135 of 2008 expired on 28 March 2009.
(B) Exploration IUP No 463 of 2009 was only issued on 17 October 2009 and
only valid from 16 June 2009.

Due to the interregnum in SRI’s mining licences from 28 March 2009 until
16 June 2009 it would not be ‘first come first served’ in relation to licences issued
before 16 June 2009 over the area covered by Exploration IUP No 463 of 2009.
The licences issued to PT BAB, PT Geo Explo, PT Kodio Multicom, PT MBM and
PT PBU were validly issued prior to 16 June 2009 and covered some of the same
area that had been covered by Exploration KP No 135 of 2008 and was
subsequently covered by Exploration IUP No 463 of 2009.’

“The Respondent's case is that it has not treated the Claimant's investment any
differently to other IUPs in East Barito or elsewhere in Indonesia with similar
problems. This is supported by the statistics set out in paragraph 10.10 of the
Defence. In addition, [...] the principle of “first come first served” was not the only
principle applied to the resolution of overlapping IUPs. [...] the “first come first
served” principle was not always applied: (1) where the overlap was because of an
administrative boundary issue; or (2) where only a small part of the mining area
overlapped with other mining areas.”?*"

218. In addition, the Respondent argues, the fact that the exploration licences of PT Kodio

Multicom and PT MBM were upgraded to Production IUPs on 11 March 2014 did not
create any additional overlapping areas because their exploration licences existed since
23 May 2008,

219. Finally, in relation to the Clean and Clear list, the Respondent submits as follows:

227

28

“The material criteria which prevented the SRI Concession from appearing on the
Clean and Clear List have not changed throughout the Clean and Clear process
and can now be found in Article 5(2)(b) of MEMR Regulation 43 of 2015.

The licence issued to PT Geo Explo was included on the Sth iteration of the Clear
and Clean List but later had its Clear and Clean status revoked due to overlapping
licenses. It was not uncommon for the MEMR to re-evaluate the Clear and Clean
status if previously unidentified defects or problems with that IUP came to its
attention.

The overlapping licenses were also validly issued but none of the still overlapping
licenses have been granted Clear and Clean status, including the one issued to PT
BAB which was prior in time to the SRI Concession. Under the Old Mining Law
and New Mining Law, Regents could only issue mining concessions within the
territory of the Regency. The Regents that issued the overlapping licenses
considered that the licenses issued to PT BAB, PT Geo Explo, PT Kodio Multicom,
PT MBM and PT PBU were issued within the administrative territory of the
respective Regencies of South Barito (in relation to PT BAB and PT Geo Explo)
and Tabalong (in respect of PT Kodio Multicom, PT MBM and PT PBU). The BIG
basic map (as used by MEMR) at the time showed that these licenses were within
the administrative territories of those Regencies, except for a slight incursion of PT
Geo Explo into the Regency of Tabalong.

  

These licence holders applied to the Regent for a KP and then IUP over an area
that was in territory recognized by the Central Government as being within that
Regency, unlike SRI. Until the respective boundaries are determined by the Minister
for Internal Affairs and this results in the areas of the licenses falling outside the

PCA CaSE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

respective Regency boundary, the Tribunal cannot declare that the licenses have
been invalidly issued. This is acknowledged by the Claimant. Equally the
Respondent has not argued that the SRI Concession was invalidly issued, even
though only the Regent of East Barito considered that the entire area of the SRI
Concession fell within East Barito Regency.

A KP holder / IUP holder is meant to hold a continuous mining licence over the
relevant area (less reduction or relinquishment). This can be seen in the
requirement that a KP or IUP holder has to submit its application for extension /
upgrading of its licence prior to the expiration of the KP or the IUP. Only a KP
holder that had been issued one category of KP could apply for the next, so for
example a KP holder that had a KP for exploration could apply for a KP for
exploitation.

Under the Old Mining Law, if an exploration KP licence holder applies for an
extension prior to its expiry but has not received its decision the holder is allowed
to continue mining exploration for a maximum period of one year. The Claimant
relies on the alleged application by SRI for a renewal of Exploration KP No 135 of
2008 on 22 December 2008. The Claimant has not produced this application (or
indeed any of the applications filed by SRI) and for the reasons set out in the
Rejoinder it is improbable that such an application was made on that date given
that SRI applied for an upgrade of its Exploration KP on 10 November 2008 and
the correspondence from the Regent on 11 April 2009.

Le]

The Claimant has not filed any evidence to support its assertion that its licence
should be preferred because of ‘first come first served’ nor has it filed any evidence
from any Indonesian lawyer or of Indonesian law that it should be on the Clean and
Clear List. This is not surprising given that the SRI Concession had both an overlap
with an administrative area of another Regency or Province (on the basis of the
recognized temporary boundary) and overlapping licenses.”

220. Third, the Respondent denies that it has failed to act with transparency and consistency.

229

230

In response to the Claimant’s specific claims in that regard, the Respondent submits as
follows:

(i) As the overlapping licences were issued before the date of the purported investment,
had the Claimant had done proper due diligence, the Claimant could have discovered that
SRI Mining Concession was impaired.?°° Furthermore, as the issuance of overlapping

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

licences predated the Claimant’s purported investment, this conduct could not be
considered a breach of any duties of transparency and consistency.”

(ii) Similarly, had the Claimant done proper due diligence, the Claimant could have
discovered the uncertainties and disagreements about the boundaries of the regencies

and that SRI Mining Concession appears to cover areas outside East Barito.?*?

(iii) Regarding Government Regulation No 24 of 2012, as explained above in the context
of legitimate expectations, it has no application to the Claimant’s claim.?*> In addition, as
explained above, even if the divestiture requirements were to apply, the percentage of
shares which SRI’s direct shareholder would have to divest would increase gradually over
a five-year period and SRI’s direct shareholder would receive compensation for any
shares it was required to divest.?34

(iv) Concerning the Claimant’s argument regarding the Clean and Clear list procedure,
the Respondent submits as follows:

“(A) The Clean and Clear list procedure has been the subject of public
announcements and extensive discussion with the industry. [

 

(B) The criteria for inchision on the Clean and Clear list have been published since
2011 [...] It is evident from those criteria why SRI’s Production IUP No 569 of
2009 is not inchided.

(©) IUP holders whose licences were not listed as Clean and Clear were advised
to contact the issuer of the IUP about their non-inclusion [...] There is nothing in
the Statement of Claim to suggest that SRI or IMFA did this.’?*°

Moreover, the Respondent submits as follows:

“SRI’s Concession is not on the Clean and Clear list because, it is impaired by
overlapping licences and boundary problems and as such is not Clean and Clear.
These problems are insuperable because the overlapping licences were issued by
other Regencies and those licences were issued within areas recognized by the
Central Government and Provincial Governments as within those other Regencies.

that SRI’s concession was within East Barito — cannot lead to licence holders in
other Regencies who were duly granted licenses, losing them. °°

(v) Regarding the Claimant’s argument concerning the maps issued by the Respondent
which showed inconsistent positions with regard to the area under the Production IUP held
by SRI, the Respondent submits that the Claimant failed to make proper due diligence. Such
proper due diligence would have identified that there were unsettled boundaries, and that
the SRI Mining Concession covers areas outside East Barito.”*”

(vi) Concerning the Claimant’s submission regarding the inconsistency of the
Respondent’s divisions in showing the status of SRI’s mining licence, the Respondent
states that this was “an administrative mistake, which has now been rectified. In any
event, the mistake was inconsequential and caused no loss.’

Fourth, the Respondent denies that Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 was motivated
by a lack of good faith.?* In any event the Respondent accepts that it has a duty to perform
its treaty obligations in good faith and argues that it has acted accordingly.“

Fifth, regarding the Claimant’s argument concerning procedural propriety and the alleged
failure to respect the “legal decree issued by the Head of the Regent”, which is
understood to be a reference to the Production IUP No 569 of 2009, the Respondent states
that no particulars of this allegation have been provided and in any case it is without basis
and is denied.”4!

Sixth, concerning the Claimant’s submission on proportionality, the Respondent argues
that it is still controversial whether the doctrine of proportionality is relevant in
determining a breach of the FET standard.”” In addition, the Respondent argues that the
Claimant did not provide particulars of this allegation and in any case, it is “wholly
unmeritorious and should be rejected.’

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

The Tribunal’s Decision

At the outset, it is important to elucidate briefly the meaning of the FET standard as
expressed in the Treaty. The Parties dispute the exact content of the FET standard. While
the Respondent argues that the FET standard in the Treaty is intended to reflect the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment, the Claimant submits that
FET standard is not limited to the customary international minimum standard of treatment
or the formula of the Neer case of 1926.

The Tribunal notes that in contrast to NAFTA or other BITs the Treaty does not expressly
limit the FET standard to treatment “in accordance with international law” or analogous
formulations. Moreover, the Tribunal also notes that several non-NAFTA tribunals that
interpreted clauses with such formulations concluded that these formulations should not
be understood as limiting the FET to the customary minimum standard of treatment.24

As rightfully argued by the Claimant, the FET standard encompasses, inter alia, the
following core principles: (1) the host state must respect the investor’s reasonable and
legitimate expectations; (2) the host state cannot act in arbitrary or discriminatory; (3) the
host state must act in a transparent and consistent manner; (4) the host state is obliged to
act in good faith; (5) the host state must respect due process and procedural propriety; (6)
the principle of proportionality.

Although the Respondent objects to the relevance of the proportionality principle to the
FET standard, the Respondent states in relation to the other principles that it “generally
accepts that a number of tribunals have considered these obligations to form part of the
FET standard, although the Claimant misstates the relevant standards which are to be

applied,’

Regarding the issue of what state’s conduct constitutes a breach of the FET standard,
while the Tribunal accepts that “the state's conduct need not be outrageous or amount to
bad faith to breach the fair and equitable treatment standard’? it is important to note
that not every inconsistency or lack of transparency of the host state will automatically
result in an FET breach. The Tribunal notes with agreement the conclusion reached by

E.g., Exhibit CL-66, Compaftid de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine
Republic, No. ARB/97/3, Award (ICSID 20 August 2007), para. 7.4.7; Exhibit CL-58, Total S.A. v.

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

the tribunal in the Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine case regarding the content of the FET:

“The FET standard defined in the BIT is an autonomous treaty standard, whose

precise meaning must be established on a case-by-case basis. It requires an action
or omission by the State which violates a certain threshold of propriety, causing
harm to the investor, and with a causal link between action or omission and harm.
The threshold must be defined by the Tribunal, on the basis of the wording of Article
II.3 of the BIT, and bearing in mind a number of factors, including among others
the following:

- whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal
Jramework;

- whether the State made specific representations to the investor;

- whether due process has been denied to the investor;

- whether there is an absence of transparency in the legal procedure or in the
actions of the State;

- whether there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad
faith conduct by the host State;

- whether any of the actions of the State can be labelled as arbitrary,
discriminatory or inconsistent.

The evaluation of the State’s action cannot be performed in the abstract and only
with a view of protecting the investor's rights. The Tribunal must also balance other
legally relevant interests, and take into consideration a number of countervailing
factors, before it can establish that a violation of the FET standard, which merits
compensation, has actually occurred:

- the State’s sovereign right to pass legislation and to adopt decisions for the
protection of its public interests, especially if they do not provoke a
disproportionate impact on foreign investors;

- the legitimate expectations of the investor, at the time he made his
investment;

- the investor’s duty to perform an investigation before effecting the investment;
- the investor’s conduct in the host country.’?47

229, After the scope of the FET standard has been defined, the Tribunal can now turn to examine

230.

247

the Claimant’s arguments concerning the alleged breach of the FET clauses in the Treaty.

The Claimant’s main case throughout the proceedings has shifted considerably. At the
outset, as expressed in the Claimant’s written pleadings, it was clear that the Claimant’s
main case referred to the Respondent’s responsibility for the issuance of overlapping
licences that arguably rendered the Claimant’s investment worthless. The claim regarding
the divestiture requirement of Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 was secondary, at
least in terms of the written arguments dedicated to this issue. Similarly, the Claimant

233.

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

dedicated only several paragraphs in its written pleadings to the issue of the Clean and
Clear list process.

Nevertheless, at the main hearing, the Claimant’s Counsel shifted the focus from the
Respondent's responsibility for issuance of the overlapping licences to the Respondent’s
responsibility for the alleged failure to resolve the overlapping boundaries and licences,
and the divestiture requirement of Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 — i.e. the two
sole surviving elements of the Claimant’s case in light of the Tribunal’s determination on
the Temporal Objection. This shift in focus by the Claimant, perhaps precipitated by the
Claimant’s Counsel anticipation of the Tribunal’s ruling regarding the Temporal
Objection, is understandable. However, this cannot change the fact that the Claimant’s
case as presented moved from the Claimant’s main claim to the subsidiary elements of
the Claimant’s claim.

The Tribunal will first deal with the alleged failure to resolve the overlapping boundaries
and licences and then deal with the issue of divestiture requirement of Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012.

At the hearing, the Claimant made it clear that the measure that arguably violated the FET
clause of the Treaty, after the Claimant made its investment, is the failure to resolve the
overlapping boundaries and licences via the Clean and Clear procedure:

“Mr Salve: [The] Temporal objection is that the measure is prior to the investment.
The Clean and Clear list is not prior to the investment. An unresolved boundary is
not the measure. The failure to resolve the boundary or resolving it in a manner
that my permit becomes worthless is the measure.

[..]

MR SPIGELMAN: Some time ago you gave us a heading saying what is the
measure. Do I take it that what you're saying is the measure is the failure to deal
with the overlapping boundaries and, therefore, the overlapping permits? Is that
your definition of the measure?

MR SALVE: Yes, sir. So the failure to — the measures are coming down in a Clean
and Clear list starting the process — and I'm going to show that you document in a
minute — ending up without resolving the boundary issue, enunciating a principle,
first come first served, when you have confusion about the boundaries but
completely failing to apply that principle, and resolve the issue of multiple permits
within the Republic of Indonesia in a fair and equitable way, And you can have a
measure which is continuing, or one time and then continues thereafter, or a

measure the effect of which is felt by further acts, and I just want to show that you
very quickly, "48

Before analysing the Claimant’s argument regarding the impugned measure, i.e. the
failure to solve the problem of conflicting boundaries and overlapping licences, the
Tribunal makes a few preliminary observations.

. First, the Claimant’s argument, from the outset, is conceptually paradoxical to some

extent. Had the Respondent not attempted to solve the alleged problem of overlapping
licences, the Claimant would not be able to complain of any specific alleged measure that
occurred after the investment was made. While it is possible to envisage a theoretical
claim concerning an omission, i.e. a failure to solve the problem which manifested in the
Respondent’s lack of any attempt to rectify the problem, in such a case, the Tribunal
would be more minded to accept the Respondent’s argument that the failure to solve a
problem is not a new act which gives rise to a new treaty claim but simply the lasting
effect of the impugned measure that occurred before the Claimant’s investment.

As explained above, the Tribunal notes the Respondent’s Temporal Objection regarding
the Clean and Clear process, i.e. that this process is not a new measure but simply the
result or effect of the act which already completed before the Claimant’s investment, i.e.
the issuance of overlapping licences. However, as explained above, in light of the
Tribunal’s ruling in the following paragraphs, it is clear that there is no need to decide the
issue of Respondent’s jurisdictional objection regarding the alleged failure to solve the
problem of overlapping boundaries and licences via the Clean and Clear process.

Second, the Claimant has repeatedly raised the issue of the “empty chair” and invited the
Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against the Respondent:

“The notable feature of this arbitration is the unfair conduct of the Respondent,
including in the manner in which it has run this case.

The Claimant's case is based upon the records available to it, and on the basis of
which the Claimant was able to establish that it made an investment and pursued
its plan for mining operations to the extent it was possible. All the information —
technical and commercial — that it gathered during this period has been fairly
placed before the Tribunal.

The manner in which permits were issued to the Claimant and to certain other
permit holders, the extent of knowledge of the Government, and the steps taken by
the Government to resolve the issue of conflicting permits, were all matters within
the knowledge of the Respondent, and had to be established by oral and
documentary evidence.

There can be little doubt that this was an attempt to keep the Tribunal in the dark,
and to shift focus to the so-called insufficient due diligence and upon the
inadequacy of information (alleged by the Respondent) available with the Claimant
to establish its case to a higher degree — while the Respondent, who was admittedly
possessed of all the information, chose to keep it back from the Tribunal.

[...] The Claimant invites the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences [...], on the
premise that had a witness been produced, the evidence he would have given would
have been against the Respondent.’?*°

While it is true that the Tribunal had, at times, insufficient information regarding
Indonesian domestic law concerning the process of solving the overlapping licences and
the Respondent could have explained in more clarity the Clean and Clear process, it is
not the Tribunal’s role to intervene in the Respondent’s choices regarding the ways it
presented its case. Moreover, the Tribunal believes that part of the problem regarding the
presentation of the Clean and Clear process stems from the fact that this process was only
a small part of the Claimant’s case during the written phase of the proceedings. As
explained above, it was only at a later stage that the Claimant shifted the focus of its case
from the issuance of overlapping licences to the Clean and Clear process.

Therefore, in contrast to the Claimant’s argument, the Tribunal did not form the
impression that the Respondent has sought to hide anything from the Tribunal. The
Respondent was attempting to deal with the pleaded case it had to meet. Accordingly, the
Tribunal declines the Claimant’s request to draw adverse inferences against the
Respondent.

Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant carries the burden of proof to establish
treaty breaches. This point is important both considering the threshold of proving a breach
of the FET standard and in light of the relatively insufficient information that the Tribunal
has had regarding the Clean and Clear process and the process of solving the overlapping
licences,

Having set out these preliminary observations, the Tribunal can now examine the
Claimant’s case regarding the failure to solve the problem of overlapping boundaries and
licences via the Clean and Clear process.

In relation to the Respondent’s alleged failure to solve overlapping boundaries and
licences via the Clean and Clear process, the Claimant states that its complaint is against
the Respondent:

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

“a) In refusing to address the issue of unsettled boundaries, in breach of the
Respondent's obligation to provide favourable conditions for investors and fair and
equitable treatment to their investments, including legal certainty and full
protection and security of the Claimant's investment under the BIT, and also in
breach of the Claimant’ legitimate expectations based on assurances within the
Respondent's legal framework.

b) In professing to apply the principle of first come first served’ — as a fair measure
to resolve overlapping permits, but then failing to apply it to the overlapping
permits in SRI’s case, so as to bring the Claimant on to the Clean and Clear List.

c) In unfailingly breaching domestic legislation commanding settlement of
boundaries.

d) In failing to restrain Regents of other Regencies from issuing permits AFTER the
Claimant’s permit, in respect of the same geographical area, thereby promoting the
breach of the ‘first come first served’ principle.’?°°

The Claimant frames each of these complaints as breaches of the various core
protections/principles of the FET (e.g. legitimate expectations, good faith etc.). However,
based on the available evidentiary record and in light of the general observations stated
above, the Tribunal does not find any merit in any of the Claimant’s complaints.

First, the Respondent is not bound by international law to reconcile its internal boundaries
disputes or overlapping internal licences. The FET standard cannot be interpreted so
widely to include such an obligation in this present case. The Tribunal agrees with the
Respondent that in light of well-established case-law, “the Claimant is required to take
the Indonesian State as it finds it, to conduct a proper due diligence and it cannot treat

the BIT as an insurance policy [...}.””>!

Second, there is no explicit legal obligation in Indonesian domestic legislation which
guarantees or warrants any timeframe within which overlapping boundaries are to be
resolved.

Third, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s explanation that it was decided that the
“first come first served” principle would only be applied by the regencies to resolve

overlapping licences after the regional boundary disputes had been determined.’*? The
Tribunal cannot find any violation of the FET standard in such decision.

Fourth, the Tribunal did not find any evidence of de jure or de facto discrimination against
the Claimant. The Respondent’s explanation concerning the feature and subsequent
removal of PT Geo Explo exploration licence No 472 of 2009 from the Clean and Clear
list is reasonable. In any case, the mere fact that several licences were featured in one of
the Clean and Clear lists is not sufficient evidence, ipso facto, to support the Claimant’s
argument of discriminatory treatment.

Similarly, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s explanation concerning the upgrade of
the exploration licences of PT Kodio Multicom and PT MBM to production IUPs in 2014
and that not having Clean and Clear status did not prevent the upgrade of IUPs.?%
Moreover, it is not clear whether the upgrade of the licences had any effect on the SRI
Mining Concession. Such upgrade of other licences cannot in and of itself be considered
a breach of the FET standard.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not filed any evidence from any
Indonesian lawyer which could support its argument that SRI Mining Concession should
have been on the Clean and Clear list. Perhaps this might not be surprising in light of the
fact that this argument throughout the written proceedings only played a minor part in the
Claimant’s case. In light of the available evidence, the Tribunal is convinced that SRI
Mining Concession is not in the Clean and Clear list because it suffered from two lasting
problems: an overlap with an administrative area of another Regency/Province and an
overlap with other licences.

To conclude, even if the Tribunal were to accept that the Clean and Clear process could
have been improved upon, the Tribunal did not find any evidence which suggests a
sufficient severity which will justify a holding of a breach of the FET.2*

The Tribunal now turns to the issue of the divestiture requirement of Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012.

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15.4.

The Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 3.9.

Professor Sornarajah stresses that in his view, the problem of overlapping licences was already known when
the Claimant made its investment, which could only be described as a useless investment in light of the
overlapping licenses. Therefore, the Claimant could not have had any legitimate expectations in the context
of the FET obligation and the Claimant cannot complain as to how the problem of overlapping licences was
dealt with by the Respondent.

AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

In the absence of a contractual stabilisation clause or an express commitment by the
Respondent, the Claimant could not have had any legitimate expectations that the laws of
Indonesia would remain exactly the same throughout the life of its investment. In
addition, the Tribunal cannot accept the suggestion that the principle of good faith
precludes the Respondent from amending its law.

In any event, the effect of Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 would not operate until
after five years of coal production. Further, the regulation provided for a sliding scale for
the next five years and therefore would not reach full effect for ten years and in any event
compensation was provided for.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not breach the FET standard
as elaborated in Articles 3(2) and 4(1) of the Treaty.

Full Protection and Security
Article 4(1) of the Treaty stipulates as follows:

“Investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party, shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable and not
less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third
State.”

Article 4(1) of the Indonesia-Germany BIT provides as follows:

“Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection
and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party under the provisions
of this Agreement.”

Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that it is entitled to rely on Article 4(1) of the Indonesia-Germany
BIT by virtue of Article (4)1 of the Treaty which includes a most-favoured-nation
(“MEN”) provision.?°°

According to the Claimant, the full protection and security, as expressed in Article 4(1)
of the Indonesia-Germany BIT, obliges the host State to provide a stable business

environment and it is not limited to physical security.?°

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has breached the full protection and security
obligation by failing to provide for a stable legal, regulatory and business environment in
contrast to assurances under the 2007 Investment Law.?°” Moreover, the Claimant argues
that the Respondent has breached the full protection and security obligation by (i) “failing
to resolve the issue caused by the grant of overlapping concessions and through multiple
definitions of boundaries in different”;?>* (ii) Government Regulation No 24 of 2012;?5°
(iii) “the inadequate recording of the Production IUP of SRI”? (iv) “selectively not

issues of other IUP holders who were enabled to feature in the Clean and Clear List,
contrary to the Respondent’s own policy of ‘first come first served’” 26!

In addition, the Claimant argues that all the facts that constitute a breach of the FET
standard equally result in a breach of the full protection and security obligation.?

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that in contrast to freestanding or unconditional MFN provisions
in other investment treaties, the MFN obligation in Article 4(1) of the Treaty is linked to
the FET obligation and not to any other standard of protection such as full protection and
security.26

Moreover, the Respondent submits that even if arguendo the Tribunal finds that the MFN
clause is freestanding, the clause cannot be used to import any additional rights from other
BITs beyond those right already contained in the Indonesia — India BIT.?*

protection and security obligation does not go beyond an obligation to exercise due
diligence in the provision of physical protection.?®

Finally, the Respondent claims that the Claimant has failed to articulate precisely how the
Respondent had breached that standard of treatment. In any event, the Respondent denies
that it had breached the full protection and security obligation.?°

The Tribunal’s Decision

In order to rely on the full protection and security obligation as elaborated in Article 4(1)
of the Indonesia-Germany BIT, the Claimant must convince the Tribunal of two
arguments: (i) the Claimant can rely on the MFN clause in the Treaty to incorporate
Article 4(1) of the Indonesia-Germany BIT to the Treaty and (ii) the Respondent has
breached the full protection and security obligation.

Even if arguendo the Tribunal accepts that the Claimant can incorporate Article 4(1) of
the Indonesia-Germany BIT into the Treaty, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant’s
claim regarding the alleged breach of the full protection and security obligation. It is
sufficient to make the following short observations.

First, the standard of full protection and security requires the host state to exercise due
diligence in the provision of physical protection to foreign investments. Unless the
relevant treaty clause explicitly provides otherwise, the standard of full protection and
security does not extend beyond physical security nor does it extend to the provision of
legal security. This point has been emphasised by various tribunals?’ and precisely
elaborated by the tribunal in the Crystallex International Corporation v. Venezuela case:

“The Parties have proposed two different interpretations of the ‘full protection and
security’ provision in Article II(2) of the Treaty. The Claimant submits that ‘full
protection and security’ extends to protection of legal security and the stability of
the legal environment, whereas the Respondent contends that such standard should
be limited to physical protection and security. The Tribunal is of the view that ‘full
protection and security’ is a distinct treaty standard whose content is not to be
equated to the minimum standard of treatment. However, the Tribunal considers
that such treaty standard only extends to the duty of the host state to grant physical

AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

protection and security. Such interpretation best accords with the ordinary meaning
of the terms ‘protection’ and ‘security’.

Furthermore, this interpretation is supported by a line of cases involving the same
or a similar phrase. For example, the tribunal in Saluka noted that [t]he practice
of arbitral tribunals seems to indicate |...] that the ‘full security and protection’
clause is not meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor's investment,
but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an investment against
interference by use of force’. And the tribunal in Rumeli held that this standard of
treatment ‘obliges the State to provide a certain level of protection to foreign
investment from physical damage’. Other arbitral decisions are to the same or
similar effect. The Tribunal agrees with this line of cases.

The Tribunal is mindful that other investment tribunals have interpreted the ‘full
protection and security’ standard more extensively so as to cover legal security and
the protection of a stable legal framework. As already noted, the Tribunal is of the
view that the more ‘traditional’ interpretation better accords with the ordinary
meaning of the terms. Furthermore, as rightly observed by a number of previous
decisions, a more extensive reading of the ‘full protection and security’ standard
would result in an overlap with other treaty standards, notably FET, which in the
Tribunal’s mind would not comport with the ‘effet utile’ principle of interpretation.
The Tribunal is thus unconvinced that it should depart from an interpretation of the
‘full protection and security’ standard limited to physical security.’?8

268. Second, in relation to the two surviving claims of the Claimant, there is nothing to suggest

269.

268,

So

that the Respondent has failed to protect the physical security of the Claimant’s
investment by failing to resolve the overlapping licences and by issuing Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012.

Finally, even assuming arguendo that the full protection and security obligation extends
to protection of legal security and the stability of the legal environment, in light of the
Tribunal’s finding on the Claimant’s FET claim, it is clear that the alleged failure resolve
the overlapping licences and Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 cannot be considered
a Treaty breach. Indeed, when the Claimant’s Counsel was asked directly by the Tribunal
whether the full protection and security claim can stand if the Tribunal rejects the
Claimant’s FET claim, the Claimant’s Counsel rightly responded in the negative.

against Unr or Discrimi 'y Measures

Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan BIT provides as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management,
maintenance, use enjoyment or disposal thereof by those investors.”

Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that it is entitled to rely on Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan BIT
as a result of the MFN provision in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.*”° According to the
Claimant, Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan BIT “prevents all types of discriminatory
conduct and not simply discrimination on the basis of nationality.”*"

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has breached the non-discrimination
requirement by “selectively not resolving the issues affecting SRI’s Production IUP,
while resolving the issues of other IUP holders who are able to feature in the Clean and
Clear List”. This discriminatory conduct has led up to “impairment of the Claimant’s
investment in Indonesia, since by not having the benefit of resohition and thereby being
placed in the Clean and Clear List, the Claimant has been rendered unable to implement
the Production IUP.’?”

The Claimant denies the Respondent’s argument that Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan
BIT imposes a higher threshold for establishing a breach than the threshold under Article
3(2) of the Treaty.?” Nevertheless, even if Respondent’s argument is correct, the
Claimant submits that it has managed to meet the test suggested by the Respondent
because “the Claimant (1) holds a qualifying investment, (2) its operation, management,

use, enjoy or disposal of that i has been impaired since it

made its investment, and (3) such impairment has resulted from inter alia discriminatory
measures on the part of the Respondent.”?"°

Respondent’s Position

Based on the same analysis of Article 4(1) of the Treaty, which was elaborated in the
context of the Claimant’s attempt to import an obligation of full protection and security,
the Respondent repeats its position that Article 4(1) does not give the Tribunal jurisdiction
to import the non-impairment obligation contained in Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan
BIT into the Treaty.?”°

Even if arguendo the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is entitled to rely on Article 3(2)
of the Indonesia-Jordan BIT, the Respondent submits as follows:

“{...] in order for the Claimant to establish a breach of Article 3(2) of the
Indonesia-Jordan BIT, it would need to prove that: (1) it holds a qualifying
investment, (2) its operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of that investment has been impaired since it made its investment, and (3)
such impairment resulted from discriminatory measures on the part of the
Respondent. It therefore imposes a higher threshold for establishing a breach than
the already high threshold under the fair and equitable treatment standard in
Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-India BIT.’?”

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to satisfy these conditions. In
particular, the Claimant has not pleaded any facts which could amount to discrimination
in the relevant sense or at all. In addition, the Respondent denies that the Claimant’s
operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and/or disposal of its alleged
indirect investment in SRI and/or the SRI Mining Concession have been impaired due to
two main reasons. First, SRI’s ability to exploit the Production [UP was already impaired
at the date the Claimant acquired its alleged indirect investment. Second, there were still
many legal requirements and practical obstacles to overcome before SRI could undertake
any mining activity.?”*

The Tribunal’s Decision

The Claimant argues that the Respondent, by failing to resolve the overlapping licences
via the Clean and Clear procedure, breached the prohibition against unreasonable or
discriminatory measures as stipulated in Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan BIT.

. In order to address the Claimant’s claim concerning Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan

BIT, the Tribunal must address first the Claimant’s reliance on the MFN clause to
incorporate substantive protections from other treaties into the Treaty,

Similarly to the Tribunal’s position concerning the full protection and security obligation,
the Tribunal is willing to assume arguendo that the Claimant is entitled to rely on the
MEN clause to incorporate Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan BIT into the Treaty.
However, in light of the Tribunal’s finding in relation to the FET standard, it is evident
that Article 3(2) of the Indonesia-Jordan BIT cannot assist the Claimant’s claim.

The Claimant has raised various arguments concerning discrimination due to the alleged
better treatment that other licences allegedly received. These arguments were examined
and dismissed above in the Tribunal’s ruling regarding the FET standard.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal feels compelled to note that arguments concerning
discrimination or arbitrary treatment are very serious. Therefore, they must be supported
by strong evidence. However, from the record of the case, the Tribunal is not convinced
that the Clean and Clear process was discriminatory.

Finally, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s argument that Article 3(2) of the
Indonesia-Jordan BIT imposes a higher threshold for establishing a breach than the
threshold under the fair and equitable treatment standard. Therefore, considering that the
Tribunal did not find the Respondent’s alleged failure to resolve the problem of
overlapping boundaries and licences a breach of the Treaty, it is no surprise that the
Claimant’s case fails also in relation to the prohibition against unreasonable or
discriminatory measures. Indeed, even the Claimant’s Counsel acknowledged at the
hearing that the claim concerning unreasonable and discriminatory measures cannot stand
if the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s FET claim.?”

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent did not breach the prohibition
against unreasonable or discriminatory measures.

Expropriation
Article 5 of the Treaty stipulates as follows:

“1. Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised,
expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation
or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as ‘expropriation’) in the territory of the
other Contracting Party except for a public purpose in accordance with law on a
non-discriminatory basis and against fair and equitable compensation. Such
compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investment expropriated
immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation
became public knowledge, whichever is earlier, shall include interest at prevailing
rate as agreed upon by both parties until the date of payment, shall be made without
unreasonable delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable.

2. The investor affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party
making the expropriation, to review, by a judicial or other independent authority
of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in
accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph. The Contracting Party
making the expropriation shall make every endeavour to ensure that such review
is carried out promptly.

3. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is
incorporate or constituted under the law in force in any part of its territory, and in
which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the
provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to
ensure fair and equitable compensation in respect of their investment to such
investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.”

Claimant’s Position

The Claimant states that Article 5 of the Treaty prohibits direct and indirect expropriations
unless the conditions for lawful expropriation are met. According to those conditions, the
expropriation must be (1) “for a public purpose in accordance with law”; (2) carried out
on a “non-discriminatory basis”; (3) in accordance with the requirement of due process
of law; (4) panied by “fair and equitable comp ion”. This comp ion must
represent the “fair market value of the investment” and “shall be made without
unreasonable delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable.”

The Claimant submits that its entire investment “including the shareholding of 70% in
SRI and the production mining business licence for coal, is the subject-matter of indirect
expropriation by the Respondent. ’?® In that context, the Claimant refers to Article 1(1)(v)
of the Treaty, which defines “investment” as “business concessions conferred by law or

AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

under contract, including concession to search for, extract and exploit natural

resources.”

According to the Claimant, “[t]he acts of Indonesia’s authorities, by issuing overlapping
mining concession to different companies, for SRI’s mining concession area, have had
the effect of mullifying SRI’s Production IUP, and amounts to an act of indirect

expropriation on account of collective actions of the Respondent.’”?*!

In addition, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has expropriated the Claimant’s
investment by introducing Government Regulation No 24 of 2012.7

The Claimant states that when examining whether expropriation has taken place, the
Tribunal should focus on the effect of impugned measures and not the Respondent’s
intent.*° Nevertheless, without admitting that the Respondent’s expropriatory intent is a
relevant consideration, the Claimant submits as follows:

“{T]he material factors as to the Respondent's lack of explanation for exclusion of
Production IUP No. 569 of 2009 from the Clean and Clear Lists, coupled with
upgradation of exploration KPs of PT Kodio Multicom and PT MBM into
production IUPs on 11 March 2014, despite allegedly overlapping mining areas
with that of SRI’s mining concession area) and recording of the Claimant's
Production IUP No. 569 of 2009 as an exploration license, [...] are acts indicative
of intent of the Respondent. ”?**

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s expropriation has not satisfied any of the
conditions under the Treaty for a lawful expropriation. In particular, the Claimant
argues that it is “for the Respondent to demonstrate both, that it was acting for public
purpose, and further that the measures taken were proportionate to the actual public
need,”85

With regard to the Respondent’s alleged failure to carry the expropriation on a “non-
discriminatory basis”, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has conducted a
discriminatory expropriation due to Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 and the

exclusion of SRI from the Clean and Clear list despite having a valid Production [UP.?8°

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

Concerning the due-process requirement, the Claimant submits that the “Respondent has
failed to establish any compensation process altogether, much less a procedurally and

substantively fair process, ’”?87

With regard to the condition of “fair and equitable compensation”, the Claimant argues
that the Treaty “requires prompt, adequate and effective compensation to be paid for any
expropriation.” 88 According to the Claimant, it received no compensation for the
expropriation of its investment by the Respondent.”*

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies that it has unlawfully expropriated the Claimant’s alleged
investments.

The Respondent claims that it “did not, let alone have the requisite intention, to
expropriate (or take ‘measures’ with an effect equivalent to expropriation of)
Claimant's speculative alleged investments (which do not qualify as investments under
the BIT).”?

In particular, the Respondent argues that it did not expropriate the Claimant’s alleged
investment through issuance of overlapping licences because those licences were issued

25\ Had the Claimant executed a

proper due diligence, it should have been aware of the status of its licences.

In addition, the Respondent argues that the SRI Mining Concession was not in the Clean
and Clear List “because, self-evidently, it was not clean and clear at the time of IMFA's
alleged investment.” Furthermore, the Respondent argues that its response to the
existence of overlapping licences has been fair. According to the Respondent, “[t]he
intent has been to address this concern. [...] the clean and clear process has been
introduced and effectuated in a transparent fashion [...] and the Claimant's investment

has not received treatment in any manner different from other investments. ’?°4

The Respondent also denies that Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 expropriated the
Claimant’s investment. As the Respondent has argued in the context of the fair and
equitable treatment, the divestiture obligations do not affect the Claimant in any relevant
time-frame.”

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that Claimant’s argument does not even amount to
a future expropriation because the divestiture requirements are conditional upon, and only
apply gradually over a number of years after, commencement of production and on
payment of fair market value. Thus, the Respondent submits as follows:

“[b]y definition, the Claimant's assertion that its investment is expropriated in its
‘entirety’ is, also for this reason, wrong. Indeed, even if Production IUP No 569 of
2009 was not impaired, as 20% of shareholders in SRI are Indonesian companies,
Indmet and SRI Indo Capital Ltd (SRI’s other foreign shareholder) would only need
to divest some of their shareholdings after 6 years of production ~ leading up to a
maximum proportion of shares held by Indonesian entities of 51% after 10 years
(post production). SRI’s direct shareholder would receive compensation for any
shares it was required to divest.’”**

Also, there were still many legal requirements and practical obstacles to overcome before
SRI could undertake any mining activity. Given that the SRI Mining Concession is only
valid for 10 years, the Respondent submit that “it was unlikely that the divestment
requirement would bite during the lifetime of the licence.’?°"

In addition, the Respondent argues that “the intention of the divestiture requirement is
not to expropriate property held by foreign investors. It is the product of the Respondent's
legitimate regulatory powers. ”?°*

Finally, as it is the Respondent cases that no expropriation has taken place, it does not
develop the arguments on the legality of the alleged expropriation.” However, it does
make the following remarks. First, the measures discussed by the Claimant have all been
taken in the public interest.>°° Second, the Claimant has failed to make out a case that it

has been treated in a manner different from investors in Indonesia that are in a comparable
position. Third, compensation is not needed as no expropriation has taken place.>"!

The Tribunal’s Decision

In relation to the surviving elements of the Claimant’s case after determination of the
temporal issue above, the Claimant argues that the Respondent indirectly expropriated its
investment via the failure to resolve the overlapping licences via the Clean and Clear
procedure and Government Regulation No 24 of 2012.

Before examining the Claimant’s allegation, the Tribunal recalls that it is well established
that an indirect expropriation can occur when there is a substantial deprivation of the
value the investment or when the investor loses control over the investment due to the
host state’s actions. This was adequately summarised by the tribunal in the Electrabel SA
v, Hungary case:

“The Tribunal considers that the accumulated mass of international legal
materials, comprising both arbitral decisions and doctrinal writings, describe for
both direct and indirect expropriation, consistently albeit in different terms, the
requirement under international law for the investor to establish the substantial,
radical, severe, devastating or fundamental deprivation of its rights or the virtual
annihilation, effective neutralisation or factual destruction of its investment, its
value or enjoyment, ”3°?

Similarly, in the ADM v. Mexico case, the tribunal stated as follows:

“Judicial practice indicates that the severity of the economic impact is the decisive

criterion in deciding whether an indirect expropriation or a measure tantamount to

expropriation has taken place. An expropriation occurs if the interference is

substantial and deprives the investor of all or most of the benefits of the investment.

There is a broad consensus in academic writings that the intensity and duration of
the economic deprivation is the crucial factor in identifying an indirect

expropriation or equivalent measure.”>

Therefore, the Claimant cannot establish a breach of Article 5 of the Treaty by merely
arguing that the value of its investment will diminish in the future due to the Respondent’s
acts. As rightfully emphasised by various tribunals, a mere loss of value is not tantamount
to expropriation, as was stated by the tribunal in the Mamidoil v. Republic of Albania case:

SOD, para. 27.24.

So

PCA Case No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

“The definition of expropriation has developed over time and gone beyond the

formalistic concentration on title [...] a further extension into the sphere of
damages, loss of value and profitability, without regard to the substance and
attributes of property, would deprive the claim of its distinct nature and
amalgamate it with other claims. Thus, a mere loss of value or a loss of benefits
that is connected to and caused by the dissolution of at least one attribute of
property, does not constitute indirect expropriation.”

First, while the Clean and Clear procedure might not be perfect and the Respondent has
not yet solved the problem of the overlapping licences/boundaries, it cannot be said that
this failure has resulted in further deprivation of the Claimant’s investment. Any possible
substantial deprivation of the Claimant’s investment due to the overlapping licences had
happened before the Claimant made its investment and therefore it is either outside the
scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or contrary to the principle of non-retroactivity as
enshrined in Article 13 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on the
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.

Second, in relation to Government Regulation No 24 of 2012, as explained above, in the
absence of any explicit contrary representations or stabilisation clauses, the Respondent
is entitled to change its laws and regulation. Moreover, as explained above, the effect of
Government Regulation No 24 of 2012 would not operate until five years of coal
production. Further, the effect was on a sliding scale for the next five years after coal
production and in any event the regulation did provide for compensation. While the
Claimant might not be content with the amount of compensation or with the divestiture
requirement which may affect the value of the Claimant’s investment, Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012 cannot be regarded as a measure that will “radically” or
“substantially” deprive the value of the Claimant’s investment.

Therefore, the Tribunal has no hesitation in finding that the Respondent did not breach
Article 5 of the Treaty.

Free Transfer of Funds

. Article 7 of the Treaty states as follows:

“I, Each Contracting Party shall permit all funds of an investor of the other
Contracting Party related to the investment in its territory to be freely transferred,
without unreasonable delay and on a non-discriminatory basis. Such finds may
include:
(a). Capital and additional capital amounts used to maintain and increase
investments;

(b). Returns including dividends and interest in proportion to their share-
holding;

(c). Repayment of any loan, including interest thereon, relating to the
investment;

(d). Payments of royalties and services fees relating to the investment;

(e). Proceeds from sales of their shares;

(p. Proceeds received by investors in case of sale or partial sale or
liquidation;

(g). The earnings of nationals of one Contracting Party who work in
connection with investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party,”

2. Nothing in paragraph (1) of this Article shall affect the transfer of any
compensation under Article 6 of this Agreement.

3. Unless otherwise agreed to between the Parties, currency transfer under
paragraph of this Article shall be permitted in any convertible currency. Such
transfer shall be made at the prevailing market rate of exchange on the date of
transfer.”

Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that its investment remained “/ocked up in Indonesia, in violation
of Article 7 of the BIT.’*® In particular, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has
violated Article 7 by virtue of Government Regulation No 24 of 2012:

“(Government Regulation No 24 of 2012] is obviously a discriminatory measure
since its promulgation which disproportionately impacts the free transfer of foreign
investments, and not that of domestic investment in the same manner.

Therefore, it is evident that by this new divestiture requirement, the ability of the
Claimant to, for example, pledge its shares to raise capital in order to increase
investments has been significantly impaired, thus, violating the Claimant’s rights
pertaining to free transfer of funds related to its investment as provided in Article 7
of the BIT. As a result of Indonesia's discriminatory conduct, the investment of the
Claimant, which in the ordinary course was capable of free transfer, remains
locked up in Indonesia in stark contrast to the situation prevailing before GR No.
24/2012, and there is no such impact impinging on domestic investments. °°

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies that it breached Article 7 of the Treaty and argues that the
Claimant's claim is inadequately particularised2°”

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

In particular, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument concerning Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012. As explained above, the Respondent submits that Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012 is not relevant to this dispute as it has not been applied to the
Claimant nor to its purported investment.>

The Tribunal’s Decision

The Claimant’s claim concerning Article 7 of the Treaty was always secondary in its
scope and level of particularisation in the Claimant’s pleadings. Perhaps, it was no
surprise that the Claimant’s Counsel explicitly withdrew this claim at the hearing:

“PRESIDENT: In your pleadings you talk about the free transfer of finds point.
Are you still relying upon that?
MR SALVE: I don't think it stands any further?

Therefore, as the Claimant’s claim is now moot, the Tribunal need not enter into a detailed
analysis of the Claimant’s claim concerning Article 7 of the Treaty, Nevertheless, in light
of the Tribunal’s analysis above, it is apparent that there is nothing in Government
Regulation No 24 of 2012 and its effect on the Claimant’s investment which could be
considered a treaty breach. This is also true in relation to Article 7 of the Treaty.

Concluding Remarks

The Tribunal accepts the submissions made by the Respondent that claims against states
under BITs are not intended as some form of insurance to keep the investor whole if it
transpires that the investments fails. Investments fail for number of different reasons,
some of which cannot be attributable to the fault of the relevant host state.

Investors, like all contracting parties, need to undertake appropriate due diligence prior
to making an investment. Mr Ray told the Tribunal that his legal team carried out a due
diligence inquiry. However, the Claimant, as was its right, refused to waive legal
professional privilege in relation to that inquiry and consequent advice. Therefore, the
Tribunal has not seen evidence as to what inquiry was in fact carried out. On the other
hand, the Tribunal has the evidence of Mr Beckmann, an Australian solicitor who has
been working in the mining sector in Indonesia for many years. Whilst the Tribunal is
prepared to accept that his evidence might have been a counsel of perfection, nevertheless,
the Tribunal accepts his evidence that conflicting boundaries and licences were in the
public domain and a detailed inquiry should have been made before investing in such a
project. The Tribunal is therefore of the view that the Claimant has not established that it

AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

undertook an adequate due diligence inquiry, and that this omission was the effective
cause of any loss claimed.

Further, an investor who might have a claim against the vendor of the rights that form the
investment cannot ignore attempting to enforce such rights as it might have and turn to
the first line of attack against the relevant host state. Mr Ray frankly told the Tribunal that
no claims have been intimated against SRI and he added also fairly that the Claimant was
on friendly terms with SRI.

In the light of the above, it is clear that the Claimant failed to take sufficient steps to
protect its own investment and thus has to bear the consequences of those omissions.

Quantum
Damages
The Tribunal’s Decision

In the light of the Tribunal’s decisions above, the issue of quantum becomes moot.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal thinks it only right to comment that it regarded the Claimant’s
quantum claim as over optimistic. The Tribunal much preferred the Respondent’s
witnesses on coal production and quantum. Had the Claimant prevailed, the Tribunal
would have ordered the return of the Claimant’s investment, something in the region of
USD 8.75 million, together with interest from the date of the expenditure until payment.

Costs
The Tribunal’s Decision

Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules states that:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term "costs"
includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribimal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are
approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if

extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(fp Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses
of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

Accordingly, the Tribunal notes the following.

The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of GBP 1,000,000.00 (GBP 500,000.00 from
the Claimant and GBP 500,000.00 from the Respondent) for this arbitration. The PCA
has advised that the final costs of the arbitration are GBP 849,993.48, including the fees
of the arbitral tribunal, which in accordance with Article 38(a) and Article 39 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, are fixed as follows:

a. Mr Neil Kaplan CBE QC SBS — GBP 241,638.16;
b. | The Honourable James Spigelman — GBP 141,625.00;
c. Professor Muthucumaraswamy Sornarajah —- GBP 125,500.
The PCA’s fees and expenses for registry services amount to GBP 84,878.78.

Other Tribunal costs, including for the travel and other expenses incurred by the
arbitrators, the fees and expenses of the tribunal secretary, hearing facilities, court
reporters, courier expenses, bank costs, communication expenses and supplies, amount
to GBP 256,351.54.

. Accordingly, the costs of the arbitration, including all items set out in paragraphs (a), (b),

(c), (d) and (f) of the Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules amount to GBP 849,993.48.
The unexpended balance of the deposit will be returned to the Parties in equal shares in
accordance with Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions, both parties filed their Costs Schedule in a timely
manner.

The Claimant claimed costs and expenses as follows:
(a) Professional and legal expenses US$ 3,702,340
(b) Experts US$ 461,561

(c) Witnesses and party representatives US$ 63,239

(d) Sums paid to the PCA US$ 667,320
(e) Other expenses US$ 18,126
Total US$ 4,912,585

The Respondent, in its amended Costs Submission of 4 December 2018 claimed as
follows:

(a) Professional and legal expenses US$ 2,200,000
(b) Experts US$ 1,112,957
(c) Witnesses and party representatives US$ 155,732
(d) Sums paid to the PCA GBP 375,000 (US$ 479,214)
(f) | Other expenses US$ 31,331
Total US$ 3,979,234
As is apparent from this Award the Respondent is the successful party.

The Respondent relies on Article 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules and Section 61(2) of
the Arbitration Act 1996 which provides that costs should follow the event. Accordingly,
the Respondent seeks an order that the “Claimant to pay the costs relating to this
arbitration in their entirety including the fees and expenses of the members of the
Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Secretary and the fees and expenses of the
PCA, the Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by the Respondent.”

Although the UNCITRAL Rules provide that costs follow the event, the Tribunal
naturally retains a discretion as to the quantum of the claimed costs and can take account,
if it deems it relevant, the conduct of the successful party.

The Respondent cannot be criticized too harshly for the way in which this case was
defended. It should not be forgotten that initially a very substantial claim was made which
was not lowered until after the experts had submitted their reports. A fixed fee
arrangement seems very reasonable to the Tribunal for a case of this nature.

It is true that many Government officials attended the various hearings. This is not
surprising given the importance of the matter to the Respondent State and further given
that the attendees straddled several government departments,

The only criticism that can possibly be levelled against the Respondent is that in its initial
response to the Tribunal setting out its jurisdictional objections, it failed to mention the
temporal objection upon which it has succeeded. This jurisdictional objection did not

PCA CASE NO 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019

surface until Simmons & Simmons served the Respondent’s Defence, Had this
jurisdictional objection been included when the Tribunal asked the Respondent to specify
its jurisdictional objections the Tribunal believes that it is more likely than not that it
would have acceded to the request for bifurcation or at least suggested to the Parties to
bifurcate the quantum phase. Had the Tribunal bifurcated issues of jurisdiction from
liability/quantum, the Tribunal believes that costs would have been saved. It is not easy
to assess this saving but the Tribunal believes that it would be fair in the circumstances
to reduce the Respondent’s costs by 15% to take this into account.

In finding that the Claimant’s costs were reasonable, the Tribunal takes into account that
the Claimant’s costs were approximately US$ | million more. This is not to be taken as
a criticism of the Claimant’s claim for costs which in the opinion of the Tribunal are also
not unreasonable, It is just that for the same case the Respondent spent US$ 1 million less
which makes its claim for costs more reasonable.

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the sums of US$ 3,500,020 x 85%
= USS 2,975,017 and GBP 424,996.74 x 85% = GBP 361,247.23 to the Respondent in
respect of the Respondent’s costs and expenses and the Respondent’s share of the costs
of this arbitration as fixed at paragraph 327 above.

Finally, both Parties requested post-award interest without indicating the appropriate
interest rate. The Respondent, for example, simply stated that the post-award interest
should be “at a commercial rate that the Tribunal considers appropriate.”

In considering the claim for post award interest on the costs award in favour of the
Respondent, the Tribunal notes that not all the costs incurred have yet been paid. Further
the Respondent gives the Tribunal no assistance with regard to the appropriate interest
rate in Indonesia. Still further, it is noted that the Respondent has not paid its share of the
deposits in a timely fashion. The Claimant made payment of US$ 750,000 to the PCA
including one payment of US$ 250,000 on behalf of the Respondent which was later
reimbursed two and half months later. All these factors militate against awarding the
Respondent post award interest on its costs. Accordingly, the Tribunal declines to order
interest on the costs awarded.

DISPOSITIVE

Having carefully considered the Parties’ arguments in their written and oral pleadings,
and having deliberated, for the reasons stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously
decides as follows:

a)  Touphold the Respondent’s Temporal Objection in relation to the alleged acts that
occurred prior to the Claimant’s investment.

and expert reports) to mid-February 2018 instead of March 2018. The
Respondent also requests that the specific date for step 18 (i.e. the
hearing) will be stated explicitly at the beginning of August 2018

Respondent.”

 

14 July 2017

The Respondent writes to the Tribunal, in reference to Claimant’s letter
of 13 July 2017, and argues that all it is asking is “for the Claimant to
confirm whether it has produced all of the documents requested by the
Respondent in the Redfern Schedule other than those said to comprise

‘legal advice”.

 

 

14 July 2017,

24 July 2017

The Respondent confirms that it did not need to ask the Tribunal for a

around adjusting the Procedural Timetable to accommodate certain
unforeseen delays relating to translation of documents, for reasons of

Reply, Witness Statements and Expert Reports (due on 26 October
2017) to Friday, 4 November 2017.

 

6 November 2017

The Respondent notifies the Tribunal that the Claimant has not filed its
Statement of Reply on the date it proposed, Friday 3 November 2017
(and not 4, which was 6 business days after the deadline set out in
Procedural Order No 3). The Respondent states that it has not heard
from the Claimant as to when it proposes to file the Statement of Reply.
The Respondent states that the delay in filing the Statement of Reply
will leave very little flexibility in the timetable for any other unforeseen
delays in the remaining steps prior to the hearing.

 

6 November 2017

The Claimant writes to the Tribunal stating that it was under the
impression that the Respondent’s Counsel has received the Claimant’s
email notifying that the Claimant will be filing its Statement of Reply
on 7 November 2017. The Claimant states that its IT system now
indicates that such email has not been transmitted.

The Claimant states that it will file its Statement of Reply on 7
November 2017 and will engage with the Respondent as to agreeing on
the corresponding extension of timeframe for the Respondent, and aim
to revert with an agreed procedural order,

 

 

6 November 2017

 

The Respondent writes to the Tribunal asserting that the “Claimant has
again failed to seek either the Respondent or the Tribunal’s consent to
an extension of time for the filing of the Statement of Reply, as required
by paragraphs 79 and 80 of Procedural Order No 1, and has not
informed either the Respondent or the Tribunal of the delay until the
time for filing has passed. Instead the Claimant has unilaterally
extended the deadline without justification.”

 

Page 107

 

PCA CASE No 2015-40
AWARD OF 29 MARCH 2019
APPENDIX |

 

The Respondent notes that the Claimant has said that that ‘it will engage
with Respondent in the matter of agreeing the corresponding extension
of timeframe for the Respondent’, The Respondent states that, to-date,
the Claimant has not made any effort to engage with the Respondent at
all on an amended timetable.

 

6 November 2017

The Claimant writes to the Tribunal stating that it has “circulated out a
draft Procedural Timetable, over to the Respondent, a short while
earlier”. It states again that the confusion regarding the submission of
Statement of Reply “emanates from a (mysteriously) missing email (our
IT is looking into this), and in keeping with past philosophy, it will
remain the bona fide endeavor of the Claimant to ensure that all such
procedural matters are readily agreed consensually, rather than to be
escalating matters of this nature over to the Tribunal.”

 

7 November 2017

The Claimant submits its Statement of Reply.

 

15 December 2017

The Parties agree on revising the Procedural Timetable and ask for the
Tribunal’s approval.

 

20 December 2017

Procedural Timetable, but decides to keep some of the original agreed
dates (i.e. items 14-16 in the revised Procedural Timetable) due to the
concern that any change will impinge upon the Tribunal’s preparation
for the hearing. The Tribunal asks for the Parties’ confirmation.

 

 

 

20 December 2017 The Claimant approves the Tribunal’s request concerning the Revised
Procedural Timetable.

10 January 2018 The Respondent approves the Tribunal’s request concerning the

APPENDIX |

26 July 2018 The Respondent submits its preliminary observations in relation to the
Claimant’s Objection.

30 July 2018 The Claimant answers the Presiding Arbitrator’s list of questions of 23

July 2018.

 

1 August 2018

The Presiding Arbitrator sends the Parties the following email
regarding the Claimant’s Objection of 19 July 2018:

“[...] The Tribunal will not make any rulings on the Claimant's
Objections of 19 July 2018 in advance of, or during, the hearing, for a
number of reasons:

1. The application disrupts the entire basis on which the
proceedings have been conducted.

2. No explanation is offered for the Claimant’s considerable
delay in raising these issues.

3. No evidence has been adduced in support of the numerous

assertions of fact made in the body of the Objections.

Permitting this range of matters to be raised at this stage

would deny procedural fairness to the Respondent and might

jeopardise the hearing which was fixed some time ago, and

which might have serious costs consequences.

#&

Thus, for the hearing, the Tribunal will admit the Respondent's
documents. The Tribunal reminds the Parties that the strict rules of
evidence do not apply in international arbitrations but the Tribunal
will consider what weight, if any, to give to documents in all the
circumstances of the case after hearing all the evidence and all the
oral and written submissions.

With regard to the documents in Categories 1 and 5, the Tribunal
requests the production of the originals at the hearing.

As to point numbered 3 in the Tribunal’s request dated 24 July 2018
and the Claimant’s response, the Tribunal understands that this is
intended as merely demonstrative of material already before the
Tribunal. It is the Tribunal’s understanding that this is not to be taken
as evidence. [...]”

 

6-10 and 14 August
2018

 

The hearing takes place.

The Respondent writes in relation to the Claimant’s submission on
costs. The Respondent notes that the “total costs of the proceedings for
the Claimant being US$4,912,485 are disproportionate compared to
the initial alleged investment made by the Claimant (of US$8.75M)
and far exceed the amount spent on the development of the alleged
mining project by the Claimant (US$2.68M — not all of which can be
claimed by the Claimant at the alleged expropriation date, see
Chapter 10 of Andrew Flower’s First Report). The costs are
accordingly disproportionate to the value of the Claimant's alleged
losses on a cost recovery basis (US$9.28-9.36M). These costs are also
approximately US$1M greater than the Respondent's costs.”

 

 

 

6 January 2019
